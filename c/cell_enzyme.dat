40|$|Mast cells {{contain an}} enzyme which hydrolyzes 3 -chloroacetoxy- 2 -naphthoic acid anilide. By using highly {{purified}} mast cells isolated by differential centrifugation in high density sucrose solutions {{we have been}} able to study this enzymatic activity in more detail. The enzyme has properties similar to those of chymotrypsin: Chymotrypsin will hydrolyze the histochemical substrate, and the chymotrypsin and mast cell activities with this substrate are similarly inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate. The mast <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> is capable of hydrolyzing the N-acetyl esters of tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, the relative rates of hydrolysis being similar to those seen with chymotrypsin. A characteristic trypsin substrate, p-toluenesulfonyl arginine methyl ester, is not acted upon by the mast <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> or chymotrypsin.

40|$|The {{possibility}} that distinct genetic factors may concur, {{in association with}} diabetes, to increase susceptibility to vascular morbidity, including hypertension, has been evaluated in ninety-four normotensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients by testing both the frequency and prevalence of hypertension in parents and by measuring membrane red blood <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> activities. Parental hypertension was present in a significantly higher proportion of diabetic compared to control subjects. A significant decrease in basal membrane red blood cell (Na(+) -K+), (Mg 2 +) and (Ca 2 +) ATPase activities was also related to the disease and was apparently uninfluenced by short [...] or long term metabolic control. In contrast with what was observed in the control group, sex caused in diabetic subjects significant variations in red blood <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> activities, with women showing the lowest mean basal values of all enzyme activities. Parental hypertension {{turned out to be}} an independent risk factor in significantly reducing red blood <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> activities both in diabetic and control subjects. However, whereas in diabetic subjects sex interacted strongly with parental hypertension in causing reduction of enzyme activities, in controls the effect of parental hypertension was sex-independent and significantly reduced basal enzyme activities, thus rendering subjects similar to diabetics. It is concluded that both sex and parental hypertension in association with diabetes, are predictors of further damage to red blood <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> activities, which may thus be linked to increased risk of susceptibility towards vascular complications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract As {{part of our}} {{comprehensive}} g netic {{study of}} the aboriginal Taiwan ese(Gaoshan), we have reported the distribution of allele frequencies for 13 red <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> and 4 serum protein polymorphisms in all nine aboriginal groups. In this study, 10 additional serum protein polymorphisms for AHSG, C 3, C 6, C 7, GC, HP, ITIH 1, PI, TF and ZAG were typed. Common and variant alleles prevail ingin East Asian populations were found together with several new variants. The distribution of allele frequencies differed markedly among the nine aboriginal groups and from that in East Asian populations. The large diversity among the aboriginal groups was confirmed by analysis of the genetic affinity {{on the basis of}} Nei's standard genetic distance and Cavalli-Sforza's chord distance, which were calculated using the present and previous data from 27 red <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> and serum protein loci. The analysis based on 15 red <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> and serum protein loci revealed that they, in particular the Puyuma and Ami, had strong affinity with Filipino among several East Asian populations...|$|E
40|$|An RNA-directed DNA {{polymerase}} {{was isolated}} from the peripheral blood leukocytes of a patient with acute myelomonocytic leukemia by successive purification of a particulate cytoplasmic fraction with endogenous, ribonuclease-sensitive DNA polymerase activity. Like RNA-directed DNA polymerase from mammalian type-C virus, the human leukemic <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> efficiently utilized (A) n·(dT) 12 - 18 and (C) n·(dG) 12 - 18 and had an approximate molecular weight of 70, 000. Further, the leukemic <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> was strongly inhibited by antisera to RNA-directed DNA polymerase of primate type-C virus in a fashion similar to that noted with an extensively purified RNA-directed DNA polymerase from a person with acute myelogenous leukemia [Todaro, G. J. & Gallo, R. C. (1973), Nature 244, 206]. By these biochemical and immunological results the leukemic <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> could be differentiated from all other known cellular DNA polymerases but could not be distinguished from RNA-directed DNA polymerase of primate type-C virus. We interpret these data, combined with observations published elsewhere, to indicate that human acute myelogenous leukemia cells contain components related to primate type-C virus. The parameters {{used in this study}} may provide the specificity and sensitivity required for determining the presence or absence and (if present) the relatedness of RNA-directed DNA polymerase in other cases and types of human leukemia...|$|E

40|$|Infection of WI- 38 human {{fibroblasts}} {{with human}} cytomegalovirus (CMV) {{led to the}} stimulation of host cell DNA polymerase synthesis and induction of a novel virus-specific DNA polymerase. This cytomegalovirus-induced DNA polymerase was purified and separated from host <b>cell</b> <b>enzymes</b> by DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose column chromatographies. It can be distinguished from host <b>cell</b> <b>enzymes</b> by chromatographic behavior, template primer specificity, sedimentation property, and the requirement of salt for maximal activity. This virus-induced enzyme has a sedimentation coefficient of 9. 2 S and is found in both the nuclei and cytoplasm of virus-infected cells, but not in uninfected <b>cells.</b> This <b>enzyme</b> could efficiently use activated calf-thymus DNA, oly(dA) -oligo(dT) 12 - 18, and poly(dC) -oligo(dG) 12 - 18 as template primers, especially poly(dA) -oligo(dT) 12 - 18, but it could not use poly(rA) -oligo(dT) 12 - 18, poly(rC) -oligo(dG) 12 - 18, or oligo(dT) 12 - 18. The enzyme requires Mg 2 + for maximal activity, is sensitive to p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, {{and is not a}} zinc metalloenzyme. In addition, the cytomegalovirus-induced DNA polymerase activity can be enhanced by adding 0. 06 to 0. 12 M NaCl or 0. 03 to 0. 06 M (NH 4) 2 SO 4 to the reaction mixture...|$|R
