40|$|Abstract. We generalize Ng’s {{algebraic}} 0 -th knot contact homol-ogy for {{links in}} S 3 to links in S 1 ×S 2, and {{prove that the}} resulted link invariant {{is the same as}} the <b>cord</b> <b>ring</b> of links. Our main tool is Lin’s generalization of the Markov theorem for braids in S 3 to braids in S 1 × S 2. We conjecture that our <b>cord</b> <b>ring</b> is always finitely generated for non-local links. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} topological {{interpretation}} of knot and braid contact homology in degree zero, {{in terms of}} cords and skein relations. This interpretation allows us to extend the knot invariant to embedded graphs and higher-dimensional knots. We calculate the knot invariant for two-bridge knots and relate it to double branched covers for general knots. In the appendix we show that the <b>cord</b> <b>ring</b> {{is determined by the}} fundamental group and peripheral structure of a knot and give applications.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between Ng's abelian <b>cord</b> <b>ring</b> and SL(2,C) characters of the two-fold branched cover Σ(K). Augmentations, and their corresponding rank, {{play a central role}} in the relationship. Our study also leads to a correspondence between trace-free SL(2,C) characters of a knot complement and augmentations. Whether the trace-free character is metabelian or not is determined by the rank of the corresponding augmentation. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given on the augmentation for it to correspond to an SU(2) character. This provides an effective tool for finding representations of relevance to singular instanton homology. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for an augmentation to induce a non-abelian SL(2,R) character of Σ(K) and exploit this to discuss branched covers with left-orderable fundamental group.

50|$|Almost {{exclusively}} {{used by the}} ninja, the kyoketsu-shoge had {{a multitude}} of useful applications. The blade {{could be used for}} pulling slashes as well as thrusting stabs. The chain or cord, sometimes made from human hair or horsehair for strength and resiliency, could be used for climbing, ensnaring an enemy, binding an enemy and many such other uses. The long range of the weapon combined a cutting tool along with the capability to strike or entangle an enemy at what the user perceived to be a 'safe' distance out of the way. When skilled with this weapon it could be used to entangle a sword and rip it from the opponents hands rendering him harmless.

In this study, we have investigated the morphology of the hugin neurons at a single-cell level by using clonal analysis. We show that single cells project to only one of the four major targets. In addition, the neurites of the different hugin cells overlap in a specific brain region lateral to the foramen of the esophagus, which could be a new site of neuropeptide release for feeding regulation. Our study reveals novel complexity in the morphology of individual hugin neurons, which has functional implication for how they coordinate feeding behavior and growth...|$|R

40|$|The 3 -dimensional {{structure}} of the plastid nucleoid was determined from serial sections of the plastid of dark-grown, greening, and light-grown cells of Ochromonas danica. In light-grown and greening cells, the chloroplast nucleoid forms a continuous <b>cord</b> or <b>ring</b> which closely follows the rim of each lateral lobe of the chloroplast and is continuous across {{the top and bottom}} of the bridge connecting the 2 chloroplast lobes. The nucleoid always lies just inside the chloroplast girdle bands where they loop around the rim of the plastid. It was demonstrated by electron-microscopic autoradiography of greening cells labelled with [3 H]-thymidine that all the plastid DNA is localized in this peripheral ring-shaped nucleoid. In the proplastid of dark-grown cells, the nucleoid also forms a ring-shaped structure lying just inside the single girdle thylakoid, although frequent irregularities, such as gaps, are present. It is postulated that the girdle bands determine the shape of the chloroplast nucleoid, possibly by having specific attachment sites for the plastid DNA molecules. A survey of the literature shows that a peripheral ring-shaped chloroplast nucleoid is a characteristic feature of the 5 classes of algae whose chloroplasts possess girdle bands, namely the Raphidophyceae, Chryso-phyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Xanthophyceae, and Phaeophyceae, and has never been observed in plants whose plastids lack girdle bands...|$|R
40|$|A {{great part}} of the {{interest}} in complex networks has been motivated {{by the presence of}} structured, frequently nonuniform, connectivity. Because diverse connectivity patterns tend to result in distinct network dynamics, and also because they provide the means to identify and classify several types of complex network, it becomes important to obtain meaningful measurements of the local network topology. In addition to traditional features such as the node degree, clustering coefficient, and shortest path, motifs have been introduced in the literature in order to provide complementary descriptions of the network connectivity. The current work proposes a different type of motif, namely, chains of nodes, that is, sequences of connected nodes with degree 2. These chains have been subdivided into <b>cords,</b> tails, <b>rings,</b> and handles, {{depending on the type of}} their extremities (e. g., open or connected). A theoretical analysis of the density of such motifs in random and scale-free networks is described, and an algorithm for identifying these motifs in general networks is presented. The potential of considering chains for network characterization has been illustrated with respect to five categories of real-world networks including 16 cases. Several interesting findings were obtained, including the fact that several chains were observed in real-world networks, especially the world wide web, books, and the power grid.

40|$|PurposeTo {{investigate}} the physiologic 68 Ga-PSMA distribution and evaluate focal or diffuse radiotracer uptake in nonprostate cancer malignancies and in incidental findings. Methods 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scans in 55 men performed {{for prostate cancer}} (49) or renal cell carcinoma (6) staging were analyzed retrospectively. Two radiologists evaluated the datasets in 2 reading sessions. First, physiological 68 Ga-PSMA uptake was evaluated. Second, scans were analyzed for incidental uptake. SUVmax and SUVmean were recorded. Other imaging modalities, histopathology, or clinical follow-up served as standard of reference. ResultsHomogenous 68 Ga-PSMA uptake of the lacrimal glands (SUVmax, 15. 7 ± 7. 2), parotid glands (SUVmax, 24. 4 ± 8. 1), submandibular glands (SUVmax, 26. 7 ± 7. 1), vocal cords (SUVmax, 8. 4 ± 3), Waldeyer ring (SUVmax, 10. 4 ± 4. 3), liver (SUVmax, 8. 2 ± 2. 5), spleen (SUVmax, 10. 9 ± 3. 9), kidneys (SUVmax, 66. 4 ± 25. 4), and pars descendens duodeni (SUVmax, 17. 6 ± 8. 9) was observed in all patients. In 65 % and 36 %, respectively, homogenous 68 Ga-PSMA uptake of the colon descendens (SUVmax, 10. 6 ± 9. 2) and the rectum (SUVmax, 3. 7 ± 1. 1) was found. Approximately 22 % exhibited a 68 Ga-PSMA uptake of the thyroid (SUVmax, 4. 5 ± 1. 2), and 21 % exhibited a 68 Ga-PSMA uptake of the knee’s synovia (SUVmax, 2. 9 ± 0. 2). Furthermore, 68 Ga-PSMA uptake was found in 1 patient because of fibrous dysplasia of the right os ilium (SUVmax, 7. 7).

40|$|Pedal peptide (PP) and orcokinin (OK) {{are related}} neuropeptides that were {{discovered}} in protostomian invertebrates (mollusks, arthropods). However, analysis of genome/transcriptome sequence data has revealed that PP/OK-type neuropeptides also occur in a deuterostomian phylum—the echinoderms. Furthermore, a PP/OK-type neuropeptide (starfish myorelaxant peptide, SMP) was recently identified as a muscle relaxant in the starfish Patiria pectinifera. Here mass spectrometry was used to identify five neuropeptides (ArPPLN 1 a-e) derived from the SMP precursor (PP-like neuropeptide precursor 1; ArPPLNP 1) in the starfish Asterias rubens. Analysis of the expression of ArPPLNP 1 and neuropeptides derived from this precursor in A. rubens using mRNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed a widespread pattern of expression, with labeled cells and/or processes present in the radial nerve <b>cords,</b> circumoral nerve <b>ring,</b> digestive system (e. g., cardiac stomach) and body wall-associated muscles (e. g., apical muscle) and appendages (e. g., tube feet and papulae). Furthermore, our data provide the first evidence that neuropeptides {{are present in the}} lateral motor nerves and in nerve processes innervating interossicular muscles. In vitro pharmacological tests with SMP (ArPPLN 1 b) revealed that it causes dose-dependent relaxation of apical muscle, tube foot and cardiac stomach preparations from A. rubens. Collectively, these anatomical and pharmacological data indicate that neuropeptides derived from ArPPLNP 1 act as inhibitory neuromuscular transmitters in starfish, which contrasts with the myoexcitatory actions of PP/OK-type neuropeptides in protostomian invertebrates. Thus, the divergence of deuterostomes and protostomes may have been accompanied by an inhibitory–excitatory transition in the roles of PP/OK-type neuropeptides as regulators of muscle activity...|$|R
40|$|Gamete {{maturation}} and spawning in starfish is {{triggered by}} a gonad-stimulating substance (GSS), which is present in extracts of the radial nerve cords. Purification of GSS from the starfish Patiria pectinifera identified GSS as a relaxin-like polypeptide, which {{is now known as}} relaxin-like gonad-stimulating peptide (RGP). Cells expressing RGP in the radial nerve cord of P. pectinifera have been visualized, but the presence of RGP-expressing cells {{in other parts of the}} starfish body has not been investigated. Here we addressed this issue in the starfish Asterias rubens. An A. rubens RGP (AruRGP) precursor cDNA was sequenced and the A-chain and B-chain that form AruRGP were detected in A. rubens radial nerve cord extracts using mass spectrometry. Comparison of the bioactivity of AruRGP and P. pectinifera RGP (PpeRGP) revealed that both polypeptides induce oocyte maturation and ovulation in A. rubens ovarian fragments, but AruRGP is more potent than PpeRGP. Analysis of the expression of AruRGP in A. rubens using mRNA in situ hybridization revealed cells expressing RGP in the radial nerve <b>cords,</b> circumoral nerve <b>ring</b> and tube feet. Furthermore, a band of RGP-expressing cells was identified in the body wall epithelium lining the cavity that surrounds the sensory terminal tentacle and optic cushion at the tips of the arms. Discovery of these RGP-expressing cells closely associated with sensory organs in the arm tips is an important finding because these cells are candidate physiological mediators for hormonal control of starfish spawning in response to environmental cues.

60|$|In the {{preparation}} of the umbrella, the first difficulty that met them was how they were to conceal their private work when the turnkey came in the evenings to take away their materials for sack-making. After some examination they discovered a plank in the floor, in the corner where they were wont to sleep, which was loose and easily forced up with one of Bill's unfinished paper-knives, which he made very strong for this special purpose! Beneath there was sufficient room to stow away the cloth with which they fashioned the additional breadth to the umbrella. To have cabbaged at one time all the sail-cloth that was required would have risked discovery; they therefore appropriated small scraps each day, and sewed these neatly together until they had enough. Soon they had a ring of canvas formed, into the centre of which the umbrella fitted exactly, and this ring was so cut and sewn in gores that it formed a continuation of the umbrella, which was thus made to spread out and cover a space of about nine or ten feet in diameter. All round the extremity or margin of the <b>ring,</b> <b>cords</b> of twisted twine were fixed, at intervals of about six inches. There were about sixty of these cords or stays, all of which met and were fastened {{at the end of the}} handle. A stout line, made of four-ply twine, was fastened at the top of the umbrella, and passing through a small hole in it was tied round the whalebones inside, and twisted down the stick to the handle, to which it was firmly secured.

40|$|PP. 161 - 375 of {{this journal}} issue entitled: 2004 ISHR World Congress MeetingThis study investigates the {{responses}} of the human umbilical artery to various contracting and relaxing agents {{in order to determine the}} mechanisms involved in the regulation of the umbilical <b>cord</b> vascular tone. <b>Rings</b> of human umbilical arteries from full-term caesarian deliveries were suspended in tissue baths containing warm Krebs–Henseleit buffer under normal and reduced oxygen conditions. These rings were contracted with cumulative additions of potassium chloride, serotonin, bradykinin, endothelin- 1, histamine and a thromboxane A 2 mimetic, U 46619. Among these vasoconstrictors, only serotonin and U 46619 elicited strong and sustained contractions at physiological concentrations in both oxygen conditions. Therefore, potassium chloride (50 mM), serotonin (10 µM) or U 46619 (1 µM) were used to contract human umbilical arterial rings, which were then relaxed with the nitrovasodilator sodium nitroprusside, the potassium channel opener levcromakalim or the calcium antagonist amlodipine. Our data suggest that {{the responses of}} the human umbilical arteries to constricting agents, but not relaxing agents, were greater in the condition with a reduced oxygen supply. The nature of the constricting agents used did not affect the potency or efficacy of sodium nitroprusside, levcromakalim or amlodipine to relax human umbilical artery. While all three relaxing agents had similar potencies in this tissue preparation, sodium nitroprusside induced significantly smaller relaxation compared to levcromakalim and amlodi pine. These data suggest that serotonin and thromboxane A 2 effectively constrict human umbilical artery at physiological concentrations. Moreover, the smooth muscle of the human umbilical artery is less responsive to vasodilators that act via the nitric oxide pathway. As such, nitric oxide donors may not be effective therapeutic agents to reduce the elevated umbilical contractile tone in pathological conditions. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Homologs of the {{vertebrate}} neuropeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{have been}} identified in invertebrates, including the insect neuropeptide corazonin (CRZ). Recently, we reported the discovery of GnRH-type and CRZ-type signaling systems in an echinoderm, the starfish Asterias rubens, demonstrating that the evolutionary origin of paralogous GnRH-type and CRZ-type neuropeptides {{can be traced back to}} the common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes. Here, we have investigated the physiological roles of the GnRH-type (ArGnRH) and the CRZ-type (ArCRZ) neuropeptides in A. rubens, using mRNA in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and in vitro pharmacology. ArGnRH precursor (ArGnRHP) -expressing cells and ArGnRH-immunoreactive cells and/or processes are present in the radial nerve <b>cords,</b> circumoral nerve <b>ring,</b> digestive system (e. g., cardiac stomach and pyloric stomach), body wall-associated muscle (apical muscle), and appendages (tube feet, terminal tentacle). The general distribution of ArCRZ precursor (ArCRZP) -expressing cells is similar to that of ArGnRHP, but with specific local differences. For example, cells expressing ArGnRHP are present in both the ectoneural and hyponeural regions of the radial nerve cords and circumoral nerve ring, whereas cells expressing ArCRZP were only observed in the ectoneural region. In vitro pharmacological experiments revealed that both ArGnRH and ArCRZ cause contraction of cardiac stomach, apical muscle, and tube foot preparations. However, ArGnRH was more potent/effective than ArCRZ as a contractant of the cardiac stomach, whereas ArCRZ was more potent/effective than ArGnRH as a contractant of the apical muscle. These findings demonstrate that both ArGnRH and ArCRZ are myoexcitatory neuropeptides in starfish, but differences in their expression patterns and pharmacological activities are indicative of distinct physiological roles. This is the first study to investigate the physiological roles of both GnRH-type and CRZ-type neuropeptides in a deuterostome, providing new insights into the evolution and comparative physiology of these paralogous neuropeptide signaling systems in the Bilateria...|$|R
