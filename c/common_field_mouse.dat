50|$|The {{wood mouse}} (Apodemus sylvaticus) {{is a common}} murid rodent from Europe and northwestern Africa. It {{is closely related to}} the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) but differs in that it has no band of yellow fur around the neck, has {{slightly}} smaller ears, and is usually slightly smaller overall: around 90 mm (3.54 in) in length. It is found across most of Europe and is a very common and widespread species, is commensal with people and is sometimes considered a pest. Other common names are long-tailed field mouse, field mouse, <b>common</b> <b>field</b> <b>mouse,</b> and European wood mouse.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Flora and fauna== The {{different}} sectors {{were each}} chosen {{for a particular}} habitat for study and conservation, with the two general environments being steppe and mountain taiga. In the steppe area, the typical landscape features shores of developed upland meadows, with small larch groves and birch, and thickets of steppe shrubs. Where rivers enter the lakes are narrow strips of reed swamps, saline steppes and meadows. The reserve has recorded more than 852 species of vascular plants in the steppe areas. [...] The mountain taiga sectors to the south are about 80 covered with coniferous forests, with smaller communities of dark-coniferous-birch forest. All told, the various sectors of the reserve have recorded 1195 species of vascular plants, from 429 genera and 105 families. The animal life of the reserve is characteristic of the northern Sayan mountain steppe and forest region. Characteristics mammals of the steppe are the steppe lemming, vole, and <b>common</b> <b>field</b> <b>mouse.</b> Larger mammals are the hare, fox and deer. Scientists on the reserve have recorded 52 species of mammals and 295 species of birds. 32 species of fish are resident, with chum salmon and trout recently having been reintroduced to Lake Bele.|$|E
50|$|The Corvus corax {{can live}} {{in a wide range}} of habitats, it is very {{successful}} at adapting to different environments. Although the Corvus corax {{can live in}} many different habitats, the common raven is hyperosmotic to its habitat as it is always in a terrestrial habitat. Living in a terrestrial habitat causes a few problems for the common raven, it constantly must intake water and salts to balance its water/salt content in the blood. Since the terrestrial habitat is hyposmotic in relation to the Corvus corax it does not have to worry about water loss, it uses kidneys to regulate salt content in the blood and usually excretes a very dilute excrement. The common raven is a very experienced hunter and will hunt anything from bird eggs, to frogs, to the <b>common</b> <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> and even up to a small chicken. When times are tough for hunting the Corvus corax will rely on its keen sense of smell and sight to scavenge for food. The Corvus corax is a master scavenger by trade and has an intake of salt by eating mostly carrion from dead animals though the common raven will easily eat human garbage if available to them.In the case of most of the populations of Corvus corax which live more in the northern parts of North America, harsh winters can be very advantageous with large death rate of herbivores allowing for easy meals for the raven. In fact food can be so bountiful that the common raven which is usually solitary in nature, only ever living with one partner to actually allow other scavengers such as bald eagles, magpies, crows, and other scavenger to fest with them on a dead pile with little to no competition. The difference in diet between the populations of Corvus corax near the sea compared to the boreal forest is immense; ravens near the more marine based terrestrial habitat prey primarily on gulls eggs and hatchlings as well as supplementing their diet with seaweed; note that the feces of these populations showed huge quantities of seaweed indicating that it was an essential source of nutrition even though it was largely indigestible.|$|E
40|$|The Xist locus plays {{a central}} role in the {{regulation}} of X chromosome inactivation in mammals, although its exact mode of action remains to be elucidated. Evolutionary studies are important in identifying conserved genomic regions and defining their possible function. Here we report cloning, sequence analysis, and detailed characterization of the Xist gene from four closely related species of <b>common</b> vole (<b>field</b> <b>mouse),</b> Microtus arvalis. Our analysis reveals that there is overall conservation of Xist gene structure both between different vole species and relative to mouse and human Xist/XIST. Within transcribed sequence, there is significant conservation over five short regions of unique sequence and also over Xist-specific tandem repeats. The majority of unique sequences, however, are evolving at an unexpectedly high rate. This is also evident from analysis of flanking sequences, which reveals a very high rate of rearrangement and invasion of dispersed repeats. We discuss these results in the context of Xist gene function and evolution. [The sequence data described in this paper have been submitted to the GenBank data library under accession nos.

40|$|AbstractDuring 2007 - 2014 has appeared, in the South part of Romania, a {{pandemic}} of <b>common</b> voles (<b>field</b> <b>mice),</b> which surprised farmers and authorities and which caused damages of 1, 200 - 2, 000 kg/ha on wheat and 1, 000 - 1, 700 kg/ha on rape. This enormous pest produced, at national level, damages of over 3 billion RON, i. e. 700 million EURO only in 2014. The {{knowledge of the}} problem and the pandemic control were obstructed by certain psycho-economic considerations, namely by the unawareness of the farmers, population and authorities regarding the statistical information arising from research. Using only mental statistics for this purpose was unsuccessful, the explosion of mice not being observed. With some recurrent behaviors, especially in the agricultural year 2009 - 2010, the common voles population (Microtus arvalis) has continuously increased, reaching 4, 000 - 6, 000 specimens/ha in 2014. Psychological studies on population, authority and farmers reaction towards this situation have been made – the results are presented in this paper. We can state that the presentation of the statistical research results is very little taken into consideration by those tested, by the respondents. New forms of presentation in order to obtain a positive reaction against common voles were required. The emotional component has {{played an important role in}} the proposal of not destroying the pest population. In the same time, the European Union principle of precaution has played an important role in the delayed elaboration of a control plan...|$|R

These diseases include scrub typhus, murine typhus, and leptospirosis. Many of the training sites are rural or semi-rural, surrounded or co-located with various forms of agriculture, and are infested with rodents and insectivores (as well as their ectoparasites), which are commonly found in association with urunanaged tall grasses, scrub, and crawling vegetation habitats. For 5 years, rodents and insectivores were collected seasonally (spring, summer, fall, and winter) at firing points 10 and 60 near the demilitarized zone and serologically tested {{for the presence of}} scrub typhus, murine typhus, and leptospirosis antibodies. Of the nine species of small mammals collected, Apodemus agrarius, the <b>common</b> striped <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> and known reservoir of scrub typhus, was the most frequently collected (90. 6 %). Only four of the nine species captured, A. agrarius (60. 9 %), Micromys minutus (100 %), Mus musculus (55. 6 %), and Rattus noroegicus (46. 7 %), were positive for scrub typhus. Of all the small mammals captured, only A. agrarius was positive for murine typhus (0. 3 %) and leptospirosis (1. 3 %). Seasonal and amlllal prevalence rates based on weight and sex are presented.

Dipartimento di Biologia Ambientale e Biodiversità, University of Palermo, Via Archirafi, 18, 90123 Palermo, Italy The faunistic analysis at the Late Pleistocene-Holocene transition in Sicily allows {{to understand the}} ecologic and/or human role in the faunal turn over of the island. Following the work of Petruso et al. (in press) we assessed that at the Pleniglacial-Late Glacial interval, in supposed absence of human occurrence, were already extinct the last endemites (the middle sized elephant, the endemic sicilian subspecies of red deer, auroch and bison) and the large predators (the spotted hyena and the cave bear) surviving in Sicily from the late Middle Pleistocene. Otherwise some other taxa already arrived during the Interpleniglacial still occur, such as the steppe ass and some small mammals (the <b>common</b> <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> while the shrew and the Terricola vole arrived slightly before), and others belonging to the long resident taxa (such as the red fox, the wolf, the wild boar and the hedgehog) of the early Middle Pleistocene. The newly arrived fauna accompanied by humans is composed by an heterogeneous group of mammals such as the lynx, the auroch, the roe and red deer, the marten, the weasel, the hare and the wild cat. All these cohort of taxa seem not {{to be influenced by}} consistent human presence {{with the exception of the}} wild ass and of the linx that become extinct at the transition with Holocene. We conclude that the faunal turn over in Sicily have been driven mostly by climatic fluctuations and geodynamic events (that modulated the connection or isolation phases of Sicily with the mainland) while the ecologic role of humans seems to have been very low until the recent Holocene. During the course of Holocene human have influenced faunal composition with massive hunting but mostly with the active and passive introduction of alien species.

40|$|The liver of the mice-type rodents of {{two species}} (of the <b>common</b> vole and <b>field</b> <b>mouse)</b> has been studied. For the first time, the common {{laws of the}} tissue and {{intracellular}} reorganization of the mice-type rodents liver have been revealed at the chronic effect of the technogenous factors complex. The development of the stereotypic morphofunctional variations (distrophy of hepatocytes and the disorders of hemodynamics) in the liver and variation of the tissue architectonics (the reduction of the volume relation of the sinusoids to hepatocytes and the stroma to parenchyma) has been shown. For the first time, the stereotypic ultrastructural variations (hyperglycogenosis and the redistribution of the organells in the cell) and the intracellular reorganization of the hepatocytes (a significant decrease of the volume density of mitochondria, of the smooth and granular endoplasmatic network) have been revealed. The different strategies of the cellular regeneration such as the intensification of the <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> polyploidy of hepatocytes and the decrease of the voles ploidy level of the different species of rodents have been detected.
