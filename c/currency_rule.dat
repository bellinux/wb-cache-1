Stimulating participation and sharing available resources are critical issues for nodes within collaborative networks. Resource allocation models that incorporate incentives enable use of available resources while, at the same time, promoting nodal participation in the network.

40|$|This paper investigates whether {{monetary}} and exchange rate policies {{are important for}} the success of major fiscal adjustments. We assess their role controlling for other determinants of success identified in the literature, including the size and composition of the deficit cut, the level of public debt and the rate of economic growth. We find that successful adjustments are preceded by exchange rate depreciations. Empirically, a depreciation of the nominal effective exchange of one standard deviation of the sample mean in the two years before an adjustment increases the probability of success by 2 percentage points. The size and composition of the deficit cut are also important determinants of success: an increase of one standard deviation of the sample mean raises the probability of success by 3 and 4 percentage points, respectively. One implication of our results is that it may be more difficult to attain persistent fiscal adjustments within the Economic and Monetary Union of Europe, since the adoption of a single <b>currency</b> <b>rules</b> out the use of exchange rate policy among member countries. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} currency {{boards in}} light of the recent economic experiences of Mexico and Argentina. Carlos Zarazaga argues that currency boards do not solve the important time inconsistency problem pointed out in the rules-versus-discretion literature. Because of this failure, even the quasi-currency board established by law (the so-called convertibility law) did not protect Argentina from one of its most severe financial crises in modern times.; In addition, there is the normative issue of whether an ironclad rule such as a <b>currency</b> board <b>rule</b> is superior to a noncontingent one. Zarazaga argues that is not the case, except perhaps when the distinction between these two kinds of rules has become blurred in countries with poor reputations for following policy commitments. In such circumstances, ironclad rules theoretically might be desirable, although this conjecture has yet to be proved formally and verified empirically. Zarazaga argues that the study of the recent economic experiences of Mexico and Argentina could be useful for addressing both issues. Currency boards; Argentina; Mexico; Money...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Recent {{research}} indicates that the random walk hypothesis (RWH) approximately describes the behavior of major dollar exchange rates during the post- 1973 float. The present analysis seeks to examine the profitability of <b>currency</b> futures trading <b>rules</b> that assume that spot exchange rates can be adequately modeled as a driftless random walk. Design/methodology/approach – Two random walk <b>currency</b> futures trading <b>rules</b> are simulated over all available data from the period 1984 - 2003. In both cases, the investor buys currencies selling at a discount and sells those selling at a premium, as the RWH implies. The two rules differ only {{in the way they}} allocate the hypothetical investor's resources among long and short foreign currency positions. Findings – Results show that an investor who used these trading strategies over the past decade would have enjoyed large cumulative gains, although periods of profit were interrupted by periods of substantial loss. Research limitations/implications – The findings encourage the hope that profitable random-walk-based strategies for currency futures trading can be devised. The simulation results have important implications for those willing to hedge, borrowers, and speculators. Originality/value – This paper provides evidence that purchasing futures contracts on currencies priced at a discount and selling futures contracts priced at a premium has generally been a profitable trading strategy during the last two decades of floating exchange rates.

After 1994, African monetary unions have adopted a fiscal rule which prescribes a permanent nil or positive budgetary balance.

40|$|In the {{prevailing}} theory of economic equilibrium with incomplete markets, assets pay in “units of account ” which {{are regarded as}} money but have no connection with the actual <b>currencies</b> that <b>rule</b> in financial dealings.

Here, a model is developed that remedies these shortcomings through innovations in “goods ” and the way agents can get utility from them. A new approach to time, states, and prices helps by loosening the grip of perfect foresight in the interpretation of future spot markets. A single currency, which can be fiat money, denominates all units of account. Such money, as a special “good, ” is supported in value by the utility agents attach to retaining it.

50|$|The Comptroller ruled {{national}} banks could “trade” {{investment securities}} they had purchased, {{based on a}} bank’s power to sell its assets, so long as this trading did not cause the bank to be a “dealer.” Section 16 itself required banks to purchase only “marketable” securities, so that it contemplated (and required) that the securities be traded in a liquid market. The Office of the Comptroller, like the Securities and Exchange Commission, distinguished between a “trader” and a “dealer.” A “trader” buys and sells securities “opportunistically” based on when it thinks prices are low or high. A “dealer” buys and sells securities with customers to provide “liquidity” or otherwise provides buy and sell prices “on a continuous basis” as a market maker or otherwise. The Comptroller of the <b>Currency,</b> therefore, <b>ruled</b> that Section 16 permitted national banks to engage in “proprietary trading” of “investment securities” for which it could not act as a “dealer.” Thus, Glass-Steagall permitted “banks to invest in and trade securities to a significant extent” and did not restrict trading by bank affiliates, although the Bank Holding Company Act did restrict investments by bank affiliates.|$|R
50|$|The world's {{blockades}} had {{a severe}} impact on patterns {{of world trade}} as a whole. On the outbreak of war, many South American countries expected to make big profits supplying the belligerents as in World War I. Nearly all of Bolivia's copper, lead, tin and silver was exported to Europe, while Uruguay and southern Brazil supplied wool and canned and frozen beef. Argentina had 84% of the world supply of flaxseed, nearly all of which was exported, along with much of its wheat (23% of world supply), its corn (71%) and beef (50%). But with the stalemate of blockade and counter-blockade, total foreign trade actually plummeted and large surpluses piled up. In early February 1941 the main exporting Plata nations (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia) held a conference in Montevideo to discuss ways of improving trade between themselves {{and the rest of}} the continent. Apart from some Parana pine, tea and cereals, there was very little inter-Plata trade, and delegates eventually agreed a number of measures, such as easier <b>currency</b> exchange <b>rules,</b> finance for poorer nations, improved transport links between countries - particularly those landlocked - and lower customs barriers in order to demonstrate that they were not entirely reliant on overseas trade and American dollars to survive.|$|R

Argentina abandoned its currency board in January 2002 after a severe recession.

40|$|Purpose – Despite {{a growing}} {{interest}} in research, no existing study explores the nature of, and the relationship between, the real exchange rate and trade imbalance between Taiwan and China. These economies were admitted to the World Trade Organization in late 2001 (China) and in January 2002 (Taiwan). This study aims to redress this deficiency.

50|$|According to EBRD {{transition}} indicators, Uzbekistan's investment climate remains {{among the}} least favorable in the CIS, with only Belarus and Turkmenistan ranking lower. The unfavorable investment climate has caused foreign investment inflows to dwindle to a trickle. It is believed that Uzbekistan has {{the lowest level of}} foreign direct investment per capita in the CIS. Since Uzbekistan's independence, U.S. firms have invested roughly $500 million in the country, but due to declining investor confidence, harassment, and currency convertibility problems, numerous international investors have left the country or are considering leaving. In 2005, the Central Bank has revoked the license of the nascent Biznes Bank citing unspecified violations of local <b>currency</b> exchange <b>rules.</b> The revocation prompted immediate bankruptcy procedures, under which clients' deposits stay arrested for two month. No interest was accrued during that two-month period. In 2006, the Government of Uzbekistan forced out Newmont Mining Corporation (at the time the largest U.S. investor) from its gold mining joint venture in the Muruntau gold mine. Newmont and the government resolved their dispute, but the action adversely affected Uzbekistan's image among foreign investors. The government attempted the same with British-owned Oxus Mining. Coscom, a U.S.-owned telecommunications company, involuntarily sold its stake in a joint venture to another foreign company. GM-DAT, a Korean subsidiary of GM, is the only known U.S. business to have entered Uzbekistan in over two years. It recently signed a joint-venture agreement with UzDaewooAuto to assemble Korean-manufactured cars for export and domestic sale. Other large U.S. investors in Uzbekistan include Case IH, manufacturing and servicing cotton harvesters and tractors; Coca-Cola, with bottling plants in Tashkent, Namangan, and Samarkand; Texaco, producing lubricants for sale in the Uzbek market; and Baker Hughes, in oil and gas development.|$|R
40|$|Using a continuous-time finance-theoretic framework, {{this paper}} {{presents}} the optimal portfolio rule of an international investor who consumes N national composite goods and who holds N domestic-currency-denominated assets with known nominal interest rates {{in an environment where}} prices of goods, assets and exchange rates follow geometric Brownian motion. It is shown that the <b>currency</b> portfolio <b>rule</b> described in Macedo (1982 a) is applicable to the case where there are N assets with a known price and one asset, gold, with a random rice in terms of the numeraire. Under these assumptions, it is found that the optimal portfolio of an investor consuming goods from all major industrialized countries (according to their weight in total trade) would be dominated in March 1981 by long positions in U. S. dollars (25 %), yen (17 %), D. marks (16 %), French francs (15 %) and pounds sterling (10 %). An investor consuming only U. S. goods, by contrast, would hold 96 % of his optimal portfolio in U. S. dollars. Because of the covariance of exchange rates and gold, the exclusion of the latter generates substantial reshuffling. The analysis of the evolution of portfolios over time shows that shares changed dramatically {{at the beginning of the}} period and did not begin to approach their March 1981 values until the end of 1975. In the case of the yen and the pound there were oscillations throughout the period. With respect to the dollar share in the optimal portfolio of the U. S. and international investor, it is found that, in the period between late 1974 and mid- 1976, a period in which the dollar is considered to have been "strong", a large decline in its optimal share took place. ...|$|R

40|$|Contractual {{boilerplate}} is {{a little}} like property. Such a statement might seem like a category mistake. After all, contractual boilerplate language is part of contracts, which, unlike property, are freely customizable by the parties. Contracts create rights between those parties, not against the world at large. Nor do people who devise new boilerplate terms usually have intellectual property in the provisions themselves. I will argue that, in an interesting and overlooked way, boilerplate is the first way station on the road from contract to property. In particular, boilerplate, like all legal communication, is the result of striking a trade-off between communicating intensively in a narrow sphere or communicating in a more stripped-down formal way in a wider variety of contexts. Contract and property form something close to comer solutions here. Contracting parties are allowed to be as idiosyncratic as they like, but the idiosyncrasies apply simply to their own dealings-usually not to those of third parties.
