25|$|In 1801, Confiance had {{her crew}} reduced to 89 men and sailed en aventurier to La Rochelle, loaded with colonial goods for {{her return to}} France. On the journey, Surcouf still managed to capture a number of ships, notably the Portuguese Ebre, with {{eighteen}} 12-pounder carronades and a 60-man crew; he released her against a ransom of 10,000 piastres and after exchanging her great mast for that of Confiance. After her arrival in France, Confiance was commissioned as a merchantman under Paul <b>Castanet</b> from May 1802.|$|E
5000|$|Of using <b>castanets</b> she said:As {{a little}} girl ( [...] I was three or four perhaps), I used to hear the insistent, percussive sound of the big <b>castanets</b> when my parents gave lessons. The unmusical noise irritated me so much that I would go and hide in the furthest part of the {{apartment}} {{so as not to}} hear its reverberation. There I would practice my tiny hands on a pair of <b>castanets</b> my father had given me, and more or less unconsciously - one hardly uses reason at that age - I sought to draw sounds from my instrument that did not hurt my ears. Such were my beginnings and I can only say that my liking for <b>castanets</b> came from the disgust that other’s <b>castanets</b> inspired in me".|$|R

5000|$|<b>Castanets</b> {{were used}} to evoke a Spanish {{atmosphere}} in Georges Bizet's opera, Carmen. They are {{also found in the}} [...] "Dance of the Seven Veils" [...] from Richard Strauss' opera Salome and in Richard Wagner's Tannhäuser. An unusual variation on the standard <b>castanets</b> can be found in Darius Milhaud's Les Choëphores, which calls for <b>castanets</b> made of metal. Other uses include Rimsky-Korsakov's Capriccio espagnol, Ravel's Rapsodie espagnole, Francis Poulenc's Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra in D minor and Karl Jenkins's Tangollen.|$|R
25|$|Crotales (hand bells) made {{of bronze}} or wood {{as well as}} {{terracotta}} rattles are known since the Bronze Age, some of which came {{in the shape of}} birds. Closed bells were sometimes built with a ring and could be strapped to the player's apparel. Weapons and shields—apart from their use for rhythmic noises on the battlefields—must have been widely adopted as percussion instruments, but the only sources in this respect are on the Gallaecian and Celtiberian culture: In his epic on the second Punic war Silius mentions the exotic songs of the Gallaecian military allies, to which they beat the rhythm on their shields. Celtiberian weapon dances are reported for the funeral of Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus. The most famous dances of Hispania however were performed by the Gaditanae, the women of Gades in Hispania Baetica, which were so popular in Rome that special teachers from Spain were hired for Roman music education. The dancers used hand clappers as an accompanying instrument, creating a lascivious dance similar to modern-day <b>castanet</b> performances. If the Celts used drumming instruments like the Roman tympanum is unknown, but very likely, because other forms of hand drums like the ceramic German Honsommern Drum, which was similar to the African djembe, are known since the Neolithic. A later Iron Age drum is the Malemort Drum found in the central French Corrèze region.|$|E

It is composed in the key of F minor with a free tempo of 72 beats per minute.

[...] "Americano" [...] is a mariachi, house, and techno track, with elements of Latin music.

As in her tableaux, she complemented her performances with elaborate costumes of her own design, often involving wings, tinsel, and flowers. She would perform [...] "Clavelitos" [...] dressed as Carmen, complete with <b>castanets</b> and a wicker basket of flowers, clicking the <b>castanets</b> and tossing the flowers one by one. When {{she ran out of}} flowers, she flung the basket too—and then the <b>castanets.</b> Her fans, aware that [...] "Clavelitos" [...] was her favorite song, would usually demand an encore, prompting her to send McMoon into the audience to retrieve flowers, basket, and <b>castanets</b> so that she could sing the number again.|$|R

60|$|I had {{hurried to}} the topmost powers of Modestine, for I dearly desired to see the view upon the other side before the day had faded. But it was night when I reached the summit; the moon was riding high and clear; {{and only a few}} grey streaks of {{twilight}} lingered in the west. A yawning valley, gulfed in blackness, lay like a hole in created nature at my feet; but the outline of the hills was sharp against the sky. There was Mount Aigoal, the stronghold of <b>Castanet.</b> And <b>Castanet,</b> not only as an active undertaking leader, deserves some mention among Camisards; for there is a spray of rose among his laurel; and he showed how, even in a public tragedy, love will have its way. In the high tide of war he married, in his mountain citadel, a young and pretty lass called Mariette. There were great rejoicings; and the bridegroom released five- and-twenty prisoners in honour of the glad event. Seven months afterwards, Mariette, the Princess of the Cevennes, as they called her in derision, fell {{into the hands of the}} authorities, where it was like to have gone hard with her. But <b>Castanet</b> was a man of execution, and loved his wife. He fell on Valleraugue, and got a lady there for a hostage; and for the first and last time in that war there was an exchange of prisoners. Their daughter, pledge of some starry night upon Mount Aigoal, has left descendants to this day.|$|E
