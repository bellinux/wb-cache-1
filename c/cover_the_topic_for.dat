50|$|At {{about this}} same time, from 1856 to 1865, John Russell Bartlett, the Secretary of State of Rhode Island, {{published}} Records of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations in New England, a ten-volume set. In 1862, volume 7, which <b>covered</b> <b>the</b> years 1770-1776 was released. Here, 136 pages <b>covered</b> <b>the</b> Gaspee affair, {{which included a}} few additional pages of correspondence (not found in Staples) surrounding {{the destruction of the}} Gaspee. George Bancroft assisted Bartlett by securing copies of documents in London. A year earlier, Bartlett had published exactly the same pages under the title A History of the Destruction of His Britannic Majesty’s Schooner Gaspee, in Narragansett Bay, on the 10th June, 1772. Almost identical to Staples’s work in content and layout, Bartlett provided more analysis and commentary than had the judge. He offered more comments in the footnotes, and laid out the text in one column instead of two, making it a 141-page book. In the introduction Bartlett justified the release of a book similar to Staples’s work, not because the latter was found wanting, but because it was scarce and out of print. Given the Whig view of the American Revolution shared by these two prestigious Rhode Islanders and most of their readers, they had sufficiently <b>covered</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> <b>for</b> their era and no full-length treatment for an adult readership of the Gaspee was published thereafter. Their work reflected the more celebratory and confident attitude of the earlier part of nineteenth century, they did not seem to struggle with living {{in the shadows of the}} accomplishments of their parents and grandparents, as so many others of their generation did.|$|R

The group, which historian Junius P.

Women's rights groups and anti-tourism groups joined to protest the practice of sex tourism in Bangkok, Thailand. The opposition to sex tourism was spurred on by an image of a Thai youth in prostitution, published in Time and by the publication of a dictionary in the United Kingdom describing Bangkok as [...] "a place where {{there are a lot of}} prostitutes". Cultural anthropologists Susan Dewey and Patty Kelly write that though they were unable to inhibit sex tourism and rates of prostitution of children continued to rise, the groups [...] "galvanized public opinion nationally and internationally" [...] and succeeded in getting <b>the</b> media to <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> extensively <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time.

40|$|In Dutch Design and Technology Education the {{beginning}} of a process of learning is usually determined by the teacher. In this paper it is argued that a beginning, determined in interaction with the students, is more profitable as the interaction will lead to joined-up exploring, creating and thinking and an increased motivation to learn. Furthermore, students are empowered to treat an activity as a means rather than an end. The interaction acts as groundwork in advance of the assignment. Groundwork is something that is done at an early stage and that makes later work or progress possible. Literature does however not <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> groundwork <b>topic</b> <b>for</b> children in <b>the</b> four-eight year age bracket. Therefore a model for the groundwork phase, consisting of five components, was designed and tested. The components are: context, communication, integration of acting and thinking, presentation of instruction and presentation of the problem. In this paper two case-studies, which handle groundwork in different ways, are described. The groundwork was in both cases addressed in group activities, aiming to prepare students to commence a process of learning. The cases show that, when used in combination, the five components appear to make groundwork successful. Careful communication gave added value. A communication link was configured between teacher and learner, between learners, and between subject and learner. Through groundwork the teacher shared both thoughts and knowledge with the students and this created a base for effective classroom communication and a common approach.

40|$|Part of the Engineering Materials {{course at}} the University of Southampton has been {{replaced}} by a computer package. A resource-based approach to system design has been implemented using Microcosm, an open architecture, Microsoft Windows based, hypermedia environment. Asymetrix Toolbook has been used in conjunction with Microcosm to produce a tutorial shell. Evaluation of the students' response to the application has been carried out in collaboration with the Department of Psychology at Southampton. Aeronautical and Ship Science engineering students completed the Revised Approaches to Studying Inventory (RASI) which indicates the characteristics of the students' learning approaches. Some of the students then had two traditional tutorial sessions replaced by tutorials during which they used the new application. The application was implemented as part of the students' general education on phase diagrams. Responses from a Phase Diagrams Inventory, which included comments on both content and application usability, revealed that the students felt positively about using the package. These responses have been examined in relation to the students' initial responses to the RASI. Overall, surprizingly little relationship was revealed between the RASI and the attitude inventory. Students' performance in assessment tests later in the course revealed no adverse learning outcome from using the computer-based learning resource. The application has been further developed in response to results from this study, and is now replacing a laboratory class that previously <b>covered</b> <b>the</b> same <b>topic</b> <b>for</b> all first year engineers taking this course, approx. 300 students.

Currently several groups and companies {{are available to}} carry out noise surveys and pointing out the noise causes in different streets or areas of a city. However, a second stage is starting now: once the noise causes are identified, control noise techniques needs to be applied. This fact is supported in the Spanish adaptation of this regulation known as Ley del Ruido (2003) that states that noise control techniques should be applied to minimize the acoustic emission of municipal work activities, municipal devices, infrastructures, road work…This means that a demand on noise control knowledge is arising.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis <b>covers</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> of deployment <b>for</b> mobile robot teams. By connecting robots in teams they can perform {{a better job than}} each individual is capable of. It also gives redundancy, increases robustness, provides scalability, and increases efficiency. Multi-robot Information Fusion also results in a broader perspective for decision making. This thesis focuses on methods for estimating formation and trajectories and how these can be used for deployment of a robot team. <b>The</b> problems <b>covered</b> discuss what impact trajectories and formation have on the total uncertainty when exploring unknown areas. The deployment problem is approached using a centralized Kalman filter, for investigation of how team formation affects error propagation. Trajectory estimation is done using a smoother, where all information is used not only to estimate the trajectory of each robot, but also to align trajectories from different robots. Both simulation and experimental results are {{presented in}} the appended papers. It is shown that sensor placements can substantially affect uncertainty during deployment. When deploying a robot team the formation {{can be used as a}} tool for balancing error propagation among the robot states. A robust algorithm for associating rendezvous observations to align robot trajectories is also presented. Trajectory alignment is used as an efficient and cost-effective method for joining mapping information within robot teams. When working with robot teams, sensor placement and formation should be considered to obtain the maximum from the system. It is also of great value to mix robots with different characteristics since it is shown that using sensor fusion the robots can inherit each other’s characteristics if sensors are used correctly. Information sharing requires modularity and general models, which consumecomputational resources. Over time computer resources will become cheaper, allowing for distribution, and each robot will become more self-contained.

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Pesticide use {{patterns}} are essential inputs into human pesticide exposure models. Currently, data included for modeling purposes have mostly been collected in cross-sectional surveys. However, it is questionable whether responses to one-time surveys {{are representative of}} pesticide use over longer periods, which is needed for assessment of health impact. This {{study was designed to}} evaluate population-wide temporal variations and within-household variations in reported residential pesticide use patterns and to compare alternative pesticide data collection methods &# 8211; web surveys versus telephone interviews. 				 				 					 						Method 					A total of 481 households in Northern California provided up to 3 annual telephone interviews on residential pesticide use; 182 of these households provided up to 6 quarterly web surveys that <b>covered</b> <b>the</b> same <b>topics</b> <b>for</b> some of <b>the</b> same time periods. Information on frequency and areas of application were collected for outdoor and indoor sprays, indoor foggers, professional applications, and behind-the-neck treatments for pets. Population-wide temporal variation and within-household consistency were examined both within telephone surveys and within web surveys, and quantified using Generalized Estimating Equations and Mixed Effect Modeling. Reporting between the two methods, the telephone survey and the web survey, was also compared. 				 				 					 						Results 					Use prevalence of outdoor sprays across the population reported in both the annual telephone surveys and the quarterly web surveys decreased over time, as did behind-the-neck treatment of pets reported in the quarterly web survey. Similarly, frequencies of use of these products decreased in the quarterly web surveys. Indoor sprays showed no statistically significant population-wide temporal variation in either survey. Intraclass correlation coefficients indicated consistent use within a household for behind-the-neck treatment on pets and outdoor sprays but great variability for the use of indoor sprays. Indoor sprays were most consistently applied in the bathroom and kitchen. Outdoor sprays were consistently more often applied by male household members, while indoor sprays were not. The two survey approaches obtained fairly similar results on the prevalence of using pesticides, but found discrepancies in use frequencies. In addition, the number of products purchased was positively correlated with application frequency for outdoor sprays (R&# 8201;=&# 8201; 0. 51, p&# 8201;=&# 8201; 0. 0005) but not for indoor sprays. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					In this population, repeated surveys are necessary either to obtain a reliable estimate of the average household use of pesticides or to project potential temporal changes of pesticide use. Web surveys could collect comparable data to traditional telephone surveys for some information. However, researchers need to consider the internet acceptability among the target population and balance lower participant burden against the need for sufficiently accurate time-varying measurement, to improve subject retention in longitudinal surveys...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{motivated}} by numerous reports of grade nine students experiencing difficulty with geometry, coupled with the increased emphasis being placed on geometry in the mathematics program for elementary grade children in the past decade. [...] The main {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate the relationship between elementary school teachers' attitudes toward geometry and the amount of time they spent teaching geometry. Since geometry is well represented in the mathematics program presently in use in the elementary schools, a minimum of six or seven weeks would be required to complete the recommended program. An important aspect of this study was to determine if elementary school teachers were spending the required amount of time to adequately <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> recommended <b>for</b> each grade level. Other concerns of the study were overall elementary teacher attitudes toward geometry, teacher experience with and preparation to teach certain geometric topics, method of instruction in geometry, teacher familiarity with manipulative aids for instruction in geometry, and any differences in attitude or time that might exist between urban and rural areas of the province. [...] The sample consisted of fifty-one rural and fifty-three urban teachers in the province of Newfoundland. Each teacher was administered a questionnaire. Upon completion of the questionnaire, a personal interview was conducted with each teacher. The teachers' responses to the questionnaires were used to analyze all aspects of the study other than time. A second instrument was administered to compile information relating to the number of weeks the teachers sampled spent teaching geometry. [...] A low positive correlation was found between, teacher attitude toward geometry and the amount of time spent teaching geometry. The overall attitude of the teachers toward geometry was found to be neutral at worst. Probably the most significant finding of the study was that the teachers reported a mean time spent on geometry of just slightly over two weeks. No significant differences were found between teachers of rural and urban areas. [...] The data collected on teacher preparation to teach, and experience with, certain topics in geometry indicated a strong relationship between the two. Teachers who were unfamiliar with certain topics in geometry expressed a reluctance to include them in their mathematics program. The areas teachers most often indicated unfamiliarity with were motion geometry, symbolic logic, three-dimensional geometry, and co-ordinate geometry. [...] While many teachers expressed their belief that an elementary school geometry program should be activity oriented, they were, in roost cases, unfamiliar with the teaching aids available to assist in the instruction of geometry. [...] Several suggestions were made for further research. These suggestions, along with a more thorough discussion of the findings of this study, are contained in the final chapter of the study...|$|R

Ainda seguindo J.
