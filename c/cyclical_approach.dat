40|$|Abstract – The {{combination}} of an agile or incremental approach with {{the implementation of}} Enterprise System (ES) is seen as a kind of catch 22. Vendors and implementers nevertheless lately tend to adhere to <b>cyclical</b> <b>approaches</b> with shortened implementation times. This way of working more and more approaches the incremental philosophy, but also influences the requirements on how the implementation process is managed in perspective of its ambitions. In this paper we explore ambition level and relate it to the used implementation approaches in five hospitals. Healthcare organizations are structured with a rather discrete separation between deterministic back office processes and the more flexible operational care processes. This differentiation makes the ambition level of an ES implementation of significant importance and offers opportunities for <b>cyclical</b> implementation <b>approaches.</b> The main question is whether the used implementation approaches align with the ambitions of the hospitals? To answer this question, a research model is build upon the MIT alignment model. From our model four hypotheses are derived and tested in five different cases. From the results we observe an increase in the use of <b>cyclical</b> <b>approaches</b> resulting in what we call macro dynamics at work in four out of the five hospitals studied. Macro dynamics means that the hospitals start drifting in either their ambition level, implementation approach or even both. Within the limitations of 5 cases we conclude that such a drift in most cases leads to implementation problems if not aligned within one implementation cycle. On the other hand persistence in ambition level and implementation approach results in a positive perception of the implementation project and its results...|$|R

We find this future-orientation for instance in scenario analysis and research-by-design, which are developed and used by distinct research or professional groups.

In this paper, we explore how integrating - or at least interrelating- concept-driven and design-driven future explorations can contribute to imagining complex man-environment relations. In this, we study how a widened understanding of 'boundary objects’, based on the initial definition from Star & Griesemer (1989) can help to integrate these approaches in planning practices.

An extensive review of CSR, sustainability and SME literature has been conducted. Building on existing research, this paper takes a novel approach to argue for effective learning of CSR actions and behaviours through a continual and ongoing adoption. This is supported by theoretical concepts that are capable of adapting to the SME environment. Accentuating the fertile ground for further research, this literature review investigates the benefits of continual and collaborative learning of CSR practices in the SME context. It is anticipated that the argued approach will have broad applicability to provide SMEs the flexibility required for the challenges and barriers in taking a broader view of success. Several contributions are made in this paper. The theoretical component of taking a <b>cyclical</b> learning <b>approach</b> (Plan-Do-Study-Act) offers an adaptable framework for the implementation of CSR. This unique approach encourages the SME to take simple and doable steps in moving toward a multiple bottom line perspective.

We look at individual- and country-level determinants of attitudes to savings in public services, and concentrate on four groups of explanations: political disaffection, ideology, self-interest, and macro-economic conditions. It was found that political disaffection, as well as the respondent’s age, education and political orientation have the strongest effects on preferences. Macro-economic variables, such as a country’s government deficit level, public debt or public expenditure have, surprisingly, no effect on citizens’ financial policy preferences...|$|R

These models define the desired, successive steps in care for that disease or condition and depict the proportion of the population that has completed each step. These models may be used to compare care across subgroups or populations and to identify and evaluate interventions intended to improve outcomes on the population level. Previous cascade or continuum {{models have been}} limited by several factors. These models are best suited to processes with stepwise outcomes—such as screening, diagnosis, and treatment—with a single defined outcome (e. g., treatment or cure) for each member of the population. However, continuum modeling is not well developed for complex processes with non-sequential or recurring steps or those without singular outcomes. As shown here using the example of diabetic foot care, the concept of continuum modeling may be re-envisioned with a <b>cyclical</b> <b>approach.</b> Cyclical continuum modeling may permit incorporation of non-sequential and recurring steps into a single continuum, while recognizing the presence of multiple desirable outcomes within the population.

The models may also support communication with other stakeholders in the process of care, including health care providers and patients...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{a fundamental}} {{analysis of the}} nature of research into e-learning. It starts by considering the phenomenon of e-learning, arguing that e-learning is an artificial, designed phenomenon, and that research approaches need to consider how the e-learning environment works and how it can be improved, before we can consider how effective it is. We also establish that e-learning inquiry involves a mixture of evaluation and research, and we discuss this in the context of different disciplinary and interdisciplinary research approaches, arguing that e-learning evaluation research involves a varying mixture of a 18 search for fundamental understanding 19 and 18 consideration of use 19. We apply the preceding arguments to the e-learning lifecycle, identifying five different forms of evaluation research which are appropriate at various stages: Baseline Analysis, Design Evaluation, Formative Evaluation, Effectiveness Research, and Project-management Evaluation. These forms can be used to guide the design of an e-learning evaluation-research study, in a <b>cyclical</b> research <b>approach.</b> We recognize the strength of design-based research in this context, without claiming that it is appropriate in all circumstances. The paper then unpacks the process of conducting evaluation research, through the use of divide-and-conquer techniques to break down the complexity of an e-learning evaluation-research study. The five forms of evaluation research allow us to conceptualise specific research questions at a particular position in the e-learning lifecycle, and evaluation-research matrices assist us to identify sources of evidence to address these questions...|$|R

This paper presents a <b>cyclical</b> teaching <b>approach</b> used in an undergraduate course that provides initial exposure to mathematical and economic reasoning using a problem-based approach involving finite mathematics and basic competence in economic principles. Students were assessed in the following areas: problem definition, solution formation and implementation, solution evaluation, and monitoring. Students were allowed repeated attempts in the form of word problems requiring use of mathematical models to provide evidence that explicit learning outcomes were met. It was found that repeated cycling through the same, explicitly defined problem solving and mathematical modelling process led to a gradual improvement. Detailed criteria were listed under each of the two major outcomes and students were provided with a check mark for each skill that was demonstrated and with detailed feedback on their performance. Each student was required to demonstrate each skill at least twice. The student’s final grade was based on the proportion of abilities demonstrated. Data showed that students improved with repeated cycling, and furthermore, that students continued to demonstrate these abilities in subsequent attempts. The mean data showed a 58 % improvement in economics knowledge, a 45 % improvement in math modelling, and a 33 % improvement in problem solving abilities. Individual data showed that even those students who demonstrated limited abilities on a first attempt were able to successfully demonstrate the ability by the last attempt.

40|$|Internationally, {{socio-economic}} trends {{reinforce the}} complex physiological mechanisms that favour positive energy balance, {{leading to an}} accumulation of excess body weight and associated metabolic disorders. This so-called 'obesogenic environment' is characterised by increasing accessibility and affordability of energy-dense foods and declining levels of physical activity. In {{the face of such}} rapidly-rising obesity rates there is general consensus that strategies to address trends in weight gain must go forwards in the absence of complete evidence of cause or effective prevention strategy. Thus, strategy implementation and evaluation must contribute to, as well as be informed by, the evidence base. Social marketing research and practice has a track record that strongly indicates that it can contribute to both the evolving knowledge base on obesity and overweight control policy and the development of effective intervention strategies. Social marketing draws pragmatically on many disciplines to bring about voluntary behaviour change as well as requisite supporting policy and environmental change. Key objectives include: generating insights into the drivers of current behaviour patterns; important barriers to change; client-oriented approaches to new desirable diet and lifestyle choices. Social marketing recognises that target clients have the power to ensure success or failure of obesity control policies. Social marketing seeks to identify genuine exchange of benefits for target adopters of behaviour change and the advocates of change, and how they may be developed and offered within an appropriate relevant context. Social marketing adopts a <b>cyclical</b> <b>approach</b> of learning, strategic development and evaluation, and therefore is well placed to integrate with the multi-disciplinary demands of obesity prevention strategies...|$|E

Our theoretical framework was drawn from the programme theories of six countries’ school inspection systems (i. e. the Netherlands, England, Sweden, Ireland, the province of Styria in Austria and the Czech Republic). We describe how inspection models differ in the scheduling and frequency of visits (using a differentiated or <b>cyclical</b> <b>approach),</b> the evaluation of process and/or output standards, and the consequences of visits, and how these models lead to school improvement through the setting of expectations, the use of performance feedback and actions of the school’s stakeholders. These assumptions were tested by means of a survey of principals in primary and secondary schools in these countries (n = 2239). The data analysis followed a three-step approach: (1) confirmatory factor analyses, (2) path modelling and (3) fitting of multiple-indicator multiple-cause models. The results indicate that Inspectorates of Education that use a differentiated model (in addition to regular visits), in which they evaluate both educational practices and outcomes of schools and publicly report inspection findings of individual schools, are the most effective. These changes seem to be mediated by improvements in the schools’ self-evaluations and the schools’ stakeholders’ awareness of the findings in the public inspection reports. However, differentiated inspections also lead to unintended consequences as principals report on narrowing the curriculum and on discouraging teachers from experimenting with new teaching methods...|$|E
