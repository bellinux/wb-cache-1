500|$|New Marais {{is built}} on two islands, and the player must work through main story {{missions}} on the first island before being able to access the next one, though future missions may involve the first island. The player can undertake side missions to make the city safer. A feature <b>called</b> <b>User</b> Generated Content, or UGC, allows players {{to make their own}} missions and share them through PlayStation Network for others to play. Scattered around the city are hundreds of [...] "Blast Shards" [...] which Cole can collect {{to increase the amount of}} electricity he can store. There are also [...] "Dead Drops" [...] that help to reveal more of the back-story in the game. A mini-map on the player's HUD shows their location in New Marais and what is nearby. The mini-map can be used to locate Blast Shards, Dead Drops and power sources.|$|E
2500|$|Windows Vista was {{released}} on November 30, 2006 to business customers - consumer versions followed on January 30, 2007. Windows Vista intended to have enhanced security by introducing a new restricted user mode <b>called</b> <b>User</b> Account Control, replacing the [...] "administrator-by-default" [...] philosophy of Windows XP. [...] Vista {{was the target of}} much criticism and negative press, and in general was not well regarded; this was seen as leading to the relatively swift release of Windows 7.|$|E
2500|$|Windows Vista changes this by {{introducing}} a privilege elevation system <b>called</b> <b>User</b> Account Control. When logging in {{as a standard}} user, a logon session is created and a token containing only the most basic privileges is assigned. In this way, the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system. When logging in as a user in the Administrators group, two separate tokens are assigned. The first token contains all privileges typically awarded to an administrator, {{and the second is}} a restricted token similar to what a standard user would receive. User applications, including the Windows shell, are then started with the restricted token, resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an Administrator account. When an application requests higher privileges or [...] "Run as administrator" [...] is clicked, UAC will prompt for confirmation and, if consent is given (including administrator credentials if the account requesting the elevation is {{not a member of the}} administrators group), start the process using the unrestricted token.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2002, Microsoft {{issued a}} patch for Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, and Windows XP that closed off some avenues of exploitation. [...] This {{was only a}} partial solution, however, as the fix was limited to {{services}} included with Windows that could be exploited using this technique; the underlying design flaw still existed and could still be used to target other applications or third-party services. With Windows Vista, Microsoft aimed {{to solve the problem}} in two ways: [...] First, local users no longer log into Session 0, thus separating the message loop of a logged-in user's session from high-privilege system services, which are loaded into Session 0. [...] Second, a new feature <b>called</b> <b>User</b> Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI) was introduced, whereby processes can be further protected against shatter attacks by assigning an Integrity Level to each process. Attempts to send messages to a process with a higher Integrity Level will fail, even if both processes are owned by the same user. However, not all interactions between processes at different Integrity Levels are prevented by UIPI. Internet Explorer 7, for example, uses the UIPI feature to limit the extent to which its rendering components interact {{with the rest of the}} system.|$|E
