5|$|Biological <b>control</b> {{is first}} {{recorded}} around 300 AD in China, when colonies of weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina, were intentionally placed in citrus plantations to <b>control</b> beetles and caterpillars. Also in China, ducks {{were used in}} paddy fields to consume pests, as illustrated in ancient cave art. In 1762, an Indian mynah was brought to Mauritius to <b>control</b> locusts, and about the same time, citrus trees in Burma were connected by bamboos to allow ants to pass between them and help <b>control</b> caterpillars. In the 1880s, ladybirds were used in citrus plantations in California to <b>control</b> scale insects, and other biological <b>control</b> experiments followed. The introduction of DDT, a cheap and effective compound, put an effective stop to biological <b>control</b> experiments. By the 1960s, problems of resistance to chemicals and damage to the environment began to emerge, and biological <b>control</b> had a renaissance. Chemical pest <b>control</b> is still the predominant type of pest <b>control</b> today, although {{a renewed interest in}} traditional and biological pest <b>control</b> developed {{towards the end of the}} 20th century and continues to this day.|$|E
5|$|Birth <b>control,</b> {{also known}} as {{contraception}} and fertility <b>control,</b> is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy. Birth <b>control</b> has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth <b>control</b> only became available in the 20th century. Planning, making available, and using birth <b>control</b> is called family planning. Some cultures limit or discourage access to birth <b>control</b> because they consider it to be morally, religiously, or politically undesirable.|$|E

5|$|The Harrier has two <b>control</b> {{elements}} {{not found}} in conventional fixed-wing aircraft: the thrust vector and the reaction <b>control</b> system. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction <b>control</b> is achieved by manipulating the <b>control</b> stick and is similar in action to the cyclic <b>control</b> of a helicopter. While irrelevant during forward flight mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.|$|E
