5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|One {{commonly}} held misconception connected to Dyer {{is that he}} holds the second longest unbeaten record of fights of any boxer in world history, after fellow Welsh fighter Jimmy Wilde. This information was published in Nat Fleischer's The Ring: Record Book And Boxing Encyclopedia, in which it states Dyer fought 94 unbeaten fights between 1908 and 1912. Although it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Dyer may have boxed 94 fights between these years, and may have turned professional in 1908, it is widely accepted that his fight with Dick Emden in 1911 in which he dislocated his knee was a loss. This therefore challenges Fleischer's claim.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in working memory. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity. It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity in other studies.|$|E

25|$|Afterwards another truce was {{concluded}} between Holland and the Frisians, which was extended {{again and again}} without many difficulties. No acts of war were undertaken anymore, although it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> a warlike state continued to exist for over a century, until, in 1524, Holland and Friesland both came under Habsburg rule.|$|E
25|$|Jerry Grossman {{has written}} that it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron can be {{considered}} to have an Erdős number of 1 because they both autographed the same baseball (for Carl Pomerance) when Emory University awarded them honorary degrees on the same day. Erdős numbers have also been proposed for an infant, a horse, and several actors.|$|E

5000|$|While, {{as in the}} {{previous}} verse, the wording seems to imply that God is the final judge, Fowler mentions other possibilities. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a teaching on healthy interpersonal relations, and the verse <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> any who judges their fellows will themselves be judged by those around them. If you find fault with others, others will find fault with you. It could also refer to the danger of excessive internal criticism and self-consciousness. If you are constantly judging others, you will feel others are doing the same and will force yourself to try and meet their standards, in direct contrast to the condemnation of worry in {{the previous}} chapter.|$|R
25|$|During his tenure, Sánchez Vilella {{tried to}} change his party's membership, urging a younger {{generation}} to rise in the friends party's organization. It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Sánchez Vilella {{was influenced by the}} youth movement that the island was experiencing countrywide during the 1960s, a period where many social areas in Puerto Rico, including television, music and sports, were being introduced to fresh, younger personalities.|$|E
25|$|Lankester {{therefore}} had a {{far better}} education than most English biologists of the previous generation, such as Huxley, Wallace and Bates. Even so, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the influence of his father Edwin {{and his friends were}} just as important. Huxley was a close friend of the family, and whilst still a child Ray met Hooker, Henfrey, Clifford, Gosse, Owen, Forbes, Carpenter, Lyell, Murchison, Henslow and Darwin.|$|E
25|$|Space {{manufacturing}} {{could enable}} self-replication. Some think it {{the ultimate goal}} because it allows an exponential increase in colonies, while eliminating costs to and dependence on Earth. It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the establishment of such a colony would be Earth's first act of self-replication. Intermediate goals include colonies that expect only information from Earth (science, engineering, entertainment) and colonies that just require periodic supply of light weight objects, such as integrated circuits, medicines, genetic material and tools.|$|E

50|$|The cave {{system is}} {{disposed}} {{more or less}} in a level plane and consists of four interconnected caverns. Two of these caverns are further subdivided by 'walls' composed of dripstone, and it <b>could</b> thus <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Karaca comprises not four but six chambers.|$|R
50|$|But, in this case, the Court {{held that}} Sony {{did not have}} actual {{knowledge}} of the infringing activities of its customers. At the most it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> Sony had constructive knowledge {{of the fact that}} “its customers may use that equipment to make unauthorised copies of copyrighted material.” The court then relied on the “staple article of commerce” doctrine of patent law and applied it to copyrights. The 'staple article of commerce' defence is available under Patent law in the United States and it lays down that when an infringing article is capable of 'substantial non infringing uses', it would become a 'staple article of commerce' and therefore, not attract any liability for infringement.|$|R
25|$|But {{discrimination}} {{was perhaps}} less overt than such events suggest. It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> some politicians and publicists may have promoted and disseminated controversial ideologies through popular {{books such as}} H. Glynn-Ward’s 1921 The Writing on the Wall and Tom MacInnes’s 1929 The Oriental Occupation of British Columbia. Newspapermen such as L. D. Taylor of the Vancouver World and General Victor Odlum of the Star generated a glut of editorials analyzing and warning about the “Oriental Menace,” as did Danger: The Anti-Asiatic Weekly.|$|E
25|$|West Frisian: Frysk-Hollânske oarloggen), were {{a series}} of short medieval wars (ranging from single battles to entire campaigns) {{consisting}} of the attempts made by the counts of Holland to conquer the free Frisian territories, which lay {{to the north and}} east of their domain. These wars were waged off and on from 1256 to 1289, 1296 to 1299, and from 1345 to 1422, although it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> a state of war continued to exist between the County of Holland and the Frisian territories till well after the year 1500.|$|E
25|$|Johns' {{breakthrough}} move, {{which was}} to inform much later work by others, was to appropriate popular iconography for painting, thus allowing a set of familiar associations to answer the need for subject. Though the abstract expressionists disdained subject matter, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> in the end, they had simply changed subjects. Johns neutralized the subject, so that something like a pure painted surface could declare itself. For twenty years after Johns painted Flag, the surface could suffice – for example, in Andy Warhol's silkscreens, or in Robert Irwin's illuminated ambient works.|$|E
50|$|Overpopulation, {{immigration}} and imperialism (of both the militaristic and cultural kind) are reasons {{that have been}} suggested to explain any such decline.

25|$|It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> at his peak, Fulci's {{fame and}} {{popularity}} {{were on a}} par with that of Dario Argento, another famous Italian horror film director whom Fulci had avoided working with as a result of Fulci publicly criticizing Argento from time to time. Fulci was most likely resentful of Argento since Argento had always received critical acclaim and recognition in Italy and abroad, whereas Fulci had been regarded there as something of a horror film hack. Fulci always joked that when he died, the Italian newspapers would all misspell his name, if they even mentioned him at all.|$|E
25|$|It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{radio was}} born in Cornwall. In 1901 at Poldhu on The Lizard, Guglielmo Marconi made his first trans-atlantic radio transmission. It would be another twenty six years before the BBC National Programme was audible in Cornwall, from the then new long wave {{transmitter}} at Daventry, although BBC transmissions began in 1922. The transmission, coming {{a long way from}} Cornwall, (from the centre of the English Midlands), was crackly and barely audible at night-time, and it was a solitary listening experience, as sets were only equipped with a single earpiece, and not a loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|Another Byzantine treatise, that of {{the thirteenth}} century doctor Nicholas Myrepsos, {{remained}} the principal pharmaceutical code of the Parisian medical faculty until 1651, while the Byzantine tract of Demetrios Pepagomenos (thirteenth century) on gout was translated and published in Latin by the post-Byzantine humanist Marcus Musurus, in Venice in 1517. Therefore, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> previous misrepresentations about Byzantium being simply a 'carrier' of Ancient Medical knowledge to the Renaissance are wrong. It is known, for example, that the late twelfth-century Italian physician (Roger of Salerno) {{was influenced by the}} treatises of the Byzantine doctors Aëtius and Alexander of Tralles as well as Paul of Aegina.|$|E
50|$|Rӧmerstadt {{failed to}} achieve its socialist, utopian goals mainly due to the {{hyperinflation}} of the 1920s, {{which led to a}} prohibitive power prices.

Despite this, as a concept and achievement it was unique and has left a planning legacy worth remembering.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the first objection, the court declared that since the Fifteenth Amendment had been accepted as valid for more than fifty years, and dealt with a similar matter (in this case, that voting rights <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> denied on account of race), it <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the new amendment was invalid due to its subject matter.|$|R
50|$|Some {{might suggest}} adherents of worm {{theology}} have inner wounds {{that they are}} not necessarily aware of, and such a belief just matches what they feel about themselves and sometimes others.

25|$|As T-REX {{began to}} wrap up, CDOT's next major effort began with Colorado Springs Metro Interstate Expansion (COSMIX). It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> COSMIX {{was even more}} {{important}} to Colorado's interests than T-REX had been, since the Colorado Springs corridor of I-25 had seen immense growth {{over the past four}} decades, and experienced major choke points all along the 16-mile corridor from Exit 135 (Academy Blvd) in the south to Exit 151 (Briargate Pkwy) in the north. Originally carrying around 8500 vehicles per day in 1960, usage of the former Monument Valley Freeway had grown to an average of 100,000 vehicles per day by 2005.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the larger}} geopolitical {{conjecture}} {{of the time and}} the lack of a formal declaration of a republic, it failed to mention anything about the role the Sultan might play under this new constitution. From a technical point of view, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> it left open the possibility that the Sultanate might not be abolished and {{that it could have been}} amended to make way for a constitutional monarchy, similar to one founded by the French Constitution of 1791. On hindsight, however, it is clear that this omission was on purpose awaiting the outcome of the Independence War and the cessation of hostilities before the proclamation of the Republic.|$|E
50|$|Cringe {{comedy is}} a {{specific}} genre of comedy that derives humor from social awkwardness. Often a cringe comedy will have an air of a mockumentary and revolve around a serious setting, such as a workplace, to lend the comedy a sense of reality. It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> the film The King of Comedy (1983), directed by Martin Scorsese, was a forerunner of cringe comedy.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, the {{distinction}} between the categories can be seen as artificial since any given cognitive task may entail a number of processes. It <b>could</b> even <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> any attempt to nicely categorize cognitive processes into clean, cut-and-dried classifications undermines the holistic, highly connective and interrelated nature of cognition. This is a criticism that can be directed at taxonomies of mental processes in general.|$|R
