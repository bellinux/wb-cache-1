50|$|Whilst some epoxy resin/ {{hardener}} combinations will cure at ambient temperature, many require heat, {{with temperatures}} up to 150 °C being common, {{and up to}} 200 °C for some specialist systems. Insufficient heat during cure {{will result in a}} network with incomplete polymerisation, and thus reduced mechanical, chemical and heat resistance. <b>Cure</b> <b>temperature</b> should typically attain the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the fully cured network in order to achieve maximum properties. Temperature is sometimes increased in a step-wise fashion to control the rate of curing and prevent excessive heat build-up from the exothermic reaction.|$|E
50|$|Balanced {{pressure}} molding using fluid as {{the heat}} transfer is commercially practiced as the 'quickstep' process. This process, however, lacks the high pressures of RTM or autoclave curing so does not typically achieve {{the high quality}} associated with aerospace and autoclave curing. This process allows for the curing, partial curing, and joining of composite materials. The process involves a fluid-filled, pressure balanced, heated floating mould technology. The heated floating mold technology used within the process works by rapidly applying heat to the laminate which is trapped between a free floating rigid or semi-rigid mold that floats in, and is surrounded by, a heat transfer fluid (HTF). The mold and laminate become separated from the circulating HTF by a flexible membrane. The part, typically under full vacuum, is subject to less than 3 psi (20 kPa) fluid pressure and can be rapidly heated to the desired <b>cure</b> <b>temperature</b> without risk of catastrophic exothermic reaction. The air is then removed under vacuum and the laminate is compacted and heated until the part is cured.|$|E

Laminates were manufactured at 700 kPa in an autoclave using eight different thermal cycles that included both raising the <b>cure</b> <b>temperature</b> above the standard 180 °C cure cycle and incorporating an intermediate dwell stage between 150 and 170 °C prior to reaching the 180 °C <b>cure</b> <b>temperature.</b> Double cantilever beam tests were conducted on specimens from the cured laminates. The stick–slip crack behaviour, observed in samples manufactured using the standard cure cycle, changed to stable crack growth when processing deviated by 10 °C.

The {{properties}} of metakaolin geopolymer paste {{are affected by}} the alkali concentration, the initial raw materials, solidification process, and amount of mixing water as well as the curing conditions. This study aimed to investigate the effect of <b>curing</b> <b>temperature</b> (room temperature, 40 °C, 60 °C, 80 °C and 100 °C) and curing time (6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h) on the geopolymer pastes produced from geopolymer powder. The results showed that <b>curing</b> at room <b>temperature</b> was unfeasible. Heat was required for the geopolymerization process, where strength increased as the <b>curing</b> <b>temperature</b> was increased. Moderate elevated <b>curing</b> <b>temperature</b> favored the strength development of geopolymer pastes in comparison with those treated with extreme elevated <b>curing</b> <b>temperature.</b> When geopolymer paste was subjected to extreme elevated <b>curing</b> <b>temperature,</b> shorter <b>curing</b> time should be used to avoid deterioration in strength gain.

The effects of phenol substitution ratio, weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of DKL and formaldehyde-to-phenol (F/P) ratio {{were also investigated}} to find the optimum <b>curing</b> <b>temperature</b> for BPF resoles. The results indicated that DKL with Mw ~ 1200 g/mol provides a <b>curing</b> <b>temperature</b> of less than 180 °C for any substitution level, provided that F/P ratios are controlled.

One way to achieve this is with a kerfless structure based on 1 - 3 connectivity piezocomposite with the electrodes defined by photolithography. To achieve this, {{not only does the}} composite need planar, parallel, and smooth surfaces, but it must also be made with an epoxy filler compatible with the chemicals, heat, and vacuum required for photolithography.

The stacking sequence for all panels was [00 / 902 / 0] 4 s. Fourteen cure cycles were designed to study {{a wide range of}} cure pressures, cure temperatures, and two different vacuum-application durations, including vacuum vent at recommended pressure and vacuum hold throughout the cure cycle. It was found that for panels cured at different temperatures and for panels cured at different pressures with a vacuum vent at recommended pressure, SBS strength did not vary significantly over a relatively wide range of cure temperatures and pressures. However, after a certain point, a decreasing trend in the average SBS strength for both H/W and RT/D was observed by reducing the <b>cure</b> <b>temperature</b> as well as the cure pressure. Panels with the same cure pressure and dissimilar vacuum-application durations showed different SBS strength, with higher properties associated with panels in which the vacuum was vented at the recommended pressure. For panels cured at various cure pressures and the vacuum hold throughout the cure cycles, C-scan results showed a cross-shaped high-porosity {{in the middle of the}} panels, which became larger as the cure pressure decreased. This defect is believed to cause higher variability of the SBS strength as the cure pressure is reduced. SBS strength was found to decrease with increasing void content in the test specimens. Theoretical models were compared to the experimental data of SBS strength vs. void content. Investigation of the failure mode for each panel revealed a change in both H/W and RT/D failure mechanism by lowering the <b>cure</b> <b>temperature</b> and cure pressure.

The influence of these parameters on the mechanical properties of epoxy/nanoclay/MWNT has been investigated using Taguchi's experimental design. The output measured responses are the tensile properties (tensile modulus, tensile strength and strain at break), impact strength and fracture toughness. From the Analysis of Mean (ANOM) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), MWNT content, pre-cure temperature and <b>cure</b> <b>temperature</b> had the most significant effects for the impact strength with contribution percentages of 38 %, 28 % and 23 % respectively.
