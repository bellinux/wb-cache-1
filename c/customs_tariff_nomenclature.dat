40|$|Abstract: The <b>customs</b> <b>tariff</b> for import is {{the main}} {{instrument}} for regulating the external commercial trade, {{according to the national}} economic benefits of the states. This practice in the international trade was ruled in Art. XI of the General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which also establishes that the contract parties in this agreement will not set up and support other restrictions for import exept the <b>customs</b> <b>tariffs.</b> Consequently, the <b>customs</b> fees for import are determined based on the <b>customs</b> <b>tariff</b> for import. The common <b>customs</b> <b>tariff</b> in the EU implies, besides applying the customs fees, a preference for third countries, on which the EU agrees. The wrong determining of the origin of products can affect the state budget, the local budget or even the fiscal features and the budget of the company. As the determining of the origin raises important problems in the practice of the customs authorities, in order to diminish the fiscal-budgetary impact, we would like to suggest to people who are interested in this a model, a possible unitary procedure for interpreting the complex provisions of the rules concerning the origin of products...|$|R

40|$|Anglophone African {{countries}} have been implementing reform and modernization initiatives in their Customs administrations. This paper outlines the progression of key reform and modernization initiatives in these countries since the early 1990 s, and assesses the gap between these reforms and those of more modern Customs agencies. The review suggests that Customs administration reform and modernization initiatives in Anglophone African countries generally lag behind international good practice and {{it is necessary to}} speed up implementation if revenue, trade facilitation, and trade chain security objectives are to be achieved. The findings also have implications on the design of reform programs and focus of potential technical assistance for the outstanding reform agenda.

40|$|<b>Custom</b> <b>tariffs</b> and {{the policy}} of <b>custom</b> <b>tariffs</b> have always been {{important}} instruments in the protection of domestic production from foreign competition, though the more in the past, the less in today's global economic environment. The idea of protectionism in international trade hasn't evaded the European Union either. The European Union has a common protectionist policy against countries that are not member to it. The agricultural production {{and the policy}} of administrative levies on the import of agricultural products pertain to the area that enjoys the highest degree of protection. The realization of such protectionist policy makes the international trade less free, while the free movement of goods is quintessential to the economic growth of the European Union, other regional economic integrations, individual countries and the society as such. The World Trade Organization, which imposes its own rules on the international trade, the creation of regional economic organizations in today's environment {{of international trade and}} free-trade agreements between individual states shrank to minimal the diapason of various protectionist measures and instruments. The decline of the idea of protectionism in international trade is evidenced by data on the share of the <b>customs</b> <b>tariffs</b> in the total fiscal revenues of the European Union and of the GDP of the member states. Namely, the fiscal impact of <b>custom</b> <b>tariffs</b> for some years shows a descending tendency, above all due to the process of globalization in foreign trade and liberalization at the scale of global economy. The European Union will be able to facilitate the development of the regional economic integrations only through the liberalization of foreign trade, because the idea of protectionism in international trade doesn't have perspectives on the long run...|$|R
