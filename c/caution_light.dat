5000|$|Angel Grove Baptist Church {{can be seen}} on {{the right}} before making a left turn while going downhill. There is a Chevron station at the <b>caution</b> <b>light</b> before going uphill and across a high bridge over a deep valley. After a slight {{right-hand}} turn, Pleasant Valley Road can be seen at the <b>caution</b> <b>light.</b> The road again straightens and passes West Point Baptist Church. It then crosses its final bridge while slightly turning left, then turns left again before a short straightaway leading past the Jacksonville Water Treatment Plant, where the speed limit drops to 45 mi/h km/h.|$|E
50|$|I've hurled through total darknessJust as blind as I could be,And {{spent the}} night in terrorOf things I could not see.I've turned my eyes to heavenSweating bullets through the flight,Reached out my hand and pressed-to-test—the Master <b>Caution</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
50|$|After São Tomé and Príncipe cut {{diplomatic}} {{relation with}} the ROC on 21 December 2016, Hou said that ROC relation with one of its other diplomatic ally is in yellow <b>caution</b> <b>light,</b> but he declined to comment which country it was.|$|E
50|$|The third caution flew on lap 106 {{after the}} cover {{to one of}} the backstretch <b>caution</b> <b>lights</b> was blown off. David Ragan stayed out to lead a lap before handing the lead to both Casey Mears and Dale Earnhardt, Jr..|$|R
50|$|On lap 199, the caution {{came when}} Stewart brushed {{the wall and}} it was {{expected}} that race would end under caution. However, the green flag came out without warning before the final lap and <b>caution</b> <b>lights</b> were still displayed around the track, causing confusion if the race was really restarted.|$|R
50|$|Bostic {{has long}} been a stop for the CSX {{railroad}} to exchange crews. CSX also has a small yard located just northwest of town. Bostic has only 3 <b>caution</b> <b>lights</b> and no red lights. There is a Seaboard Coast Line Caboose placed next to the railroad tracks in the middle of town.|$|R
5000|$|For example, if a {{state has}} a number of outputs (e.g. [...] "a= motor counter-clockwise=1, b= <b>caution</b> <b>light</b> inactive=0") the diagram should reflect this : e.g. [...] "q5/1,0" [...] designates state q5 with outputs a=1, b=0. This {{designator}} will be written inside the state's circle.|$|E
50|$|Running through Castor {{are three}} main highways: Hwy 153 (known in Castor as Front Street), Hwy 507 and Hwy 4 which {{intersect}} {{in the middle}} of Castor at a 4-way-stop <b>caution</b> <b>light.</b> Other roads include The Ridge Rd, Elm St, Pardee St, Oak St, Watson Rd and Lodge St.|$|E
5000|$|Level 2 Failures: amber cautions, {{failures}} {{that require}} crew attention but not immediate action. For example, air bleed failure or fuel fault. They have no direct consequence to flight safety and are {{shown to the}} crew through an amber master <b>caution</b> <b>light,</b> a caution (amber) ECAM message and a single chime.|$|E
50|$|The car {{tested by}} The Times also had white leather {{upholstery}} and deep lambswool carpets, tachometer, ammeter, oil gauge, clock, headlamp flasher (vital) and water temperature gauge. Further extras were: a laminated wood steering wheel to maintain firm grip (by soaking up sweat), automatic red <b>caution</b> <b>lights</b> on open doors, a reading light, cigar lighter, twin-speaker radio and {{an air blower}} to demist the rear window.|$|R
50|$|At {{the drop}} of the green flag, Joe Leonard in the #60 STP Turbine took the lead, with Bobby Unser in second and Roger McCluskey up to third {{at the end of}} lap one. A fast pace was set over the first 100 miles, with no yellow <b>caution</b> <b>lights.</b> Bobby Unser took the lead {{for the first time on}} lap 8, and led most of the first half.|$|R
5000|$|Another Saab feature was the [...] "Night Panel", which {{permitted}} dousing of {{the instrument}} panel lighting, except for essential information, for less distraction when driving at night. Once the night panel button (located by the stereo and <b>caution</b> <b>lights)</b> has been activated, the instrument cluster will dim except for the speedometer, which will illuminate from 0-87 mph, until 87 has been exceeded. As a gauge becomes a necessity for the driver's attention, it will illuminate (for example, if the car needs to be refueled, if the engine is overheating, etc.) ...|$|R
50|$|Note: Unofficially Oriol Servià {{finished}} 5th, 8.8757 seconds {{behind the}} leader, with Scott Dixon placing 6th. When the official results were posted, {{it was determined}} that Servia passed Dixon on the final lap while the yellow <b>caution</b> <b>light</b> was illuminated. Officials re-instated Dixon to 5th, and dropped Servia to 6th in the final standings.|$|E
5000|$|Phillips, {{whose body}} was {{mutilated}} by the track's steel catch fence and a <b>caution</b> <b>light</b> fixture at high speed, was both dismembered and decapitated, in what a photographer on-scene described, [...] "as gruesome a wreck as I can ever recall". In video footage {{taken at the}} scene of the accident, the first rescuer is initially shown running to the car, then immediately turning away after seeing Phillips' body and realizing the hopelessness of any attempt at resuscitation. The track was littered with car debris, blood, bone, and numerous external and internal body parts, necessitating a complete and lengthy red flag while track officials wearing surgical gloves placed white sheets over various body parts in the vicinity of the crash and hosed down the stands, which were showered with the mess. Phillips' head - still in his racing helmet - was found at the entrance of the pit road, and one of his hands was found suspended in the retaining fence, around where the <b>caution</b> <b>light</b> had been.|$|E
50|$|On lap 46, {{the yellow}} {{came out for}} a crash by Bud Tingelstad in turn two. At the same time, Allen Crowe lost a wheel and crashed in turn 1. Still under the <b>caution</b> <b>light</b> on lap 50, Jim McElreath and Bobby Marshman spun in the pit area. They avoided a major mishap and made no contact. They got to their pit stalls, and rejoined the race.|$|E
3000|$|... 2 These {{conclusions}} are however {{to be taken}} with <b>caution</b> in <b>light</b> {{of the risk of}} inconsistent estimates in Table  3 arising from the likely non-statioarity of the unemployment rate, revealed inter-alia by the high first-order auto-regressive coefficient.|$|R
50|$|On the start, Kurt Busch led {{the field}} to the green flag. On the same lap, Jeff Gordon passed Kurt Busch for the lead. On lap 2, Kevin Conway {{collided}} with the wall; to cause the first caution. On lap 5, Jeff Gordon led {{the field to}} the green flag. After the restart, the field became spread out, but on lap 45, Mike Bliss collided with the wall {{to bring out the}} second caution. The restart happened on lap 52, with Jeff Gordon leading. One lap later, Greg Biffle passed Gordon, and the third caution came out. The third caution came out because the <b>caution</b> <b>lights</b> did not turn off. On the lap 56 restart, Greg Biffle led the field to the green flag, but one lap later, Jeff Gordon reclaimed the lead.|$|R
50|$|Luyendyk guided his {{teammate}} Goodyear (second place), {{and the rest}} of the field around at a slow pace. As the cars came out of turn four, they anticipated seeing the white flag (indicating one lap to go), and it was clear to them the race would finish under caution, as did IMS Radio Network announcer Bob Jenkins. Without any warning, USAC officials suddenly displayed the white and green flag at the starter's stand, and the race was back underway. A startled Luyendyk, running about 85 mph, hastily dropped a gear, and punched the throttle to accelerate. The entire field was caught off-guard, and to make matters worse, the yellow <b>caution</b> <b>lights</b> around the track remained illuminated. The confusion made some drivers unsure if the green flag was in error, and if the conditions were safe to race.|$|R
50|$|In {{the next}} few minutes, several warning lights on the {{overhead}} panel in the cockpit illuminated. One {{or both of the}} equipment cooling warning lights came on to indicate low airflow through the cooling fans (a result of the decreased air density), accompanied by the master <b>caution</b> <b>light.</b> The passenger oxygen light illuminated when, at an altitude of approximately 18000 ft, the oxygen masks in the passenger cabin automatically deployed.|$|E
5000|$|As of September 2011, {{the town}} of Martin has a few Main Street business. A local [...] "gently used" [...] shop {{by the name of}} [...] "The One Stop Baby Shop" [...] is located at the <b>caution</b> <b>light</b> on Main Street. During the summer of 2011 an ice cream shop was opened up with a moving water wheel decoration. There is also an antique shop and a small plant nursery that is open seasonally.|$|E
50|$|The route {{originates}} {{at the end}} of Seventh Street in Downtown Shelbyville. It heads {{north and}} crosses over Clear Creek and passes the Shelby County Detention Center on the left with houses lining the road on the right. At Burks Branch Road, the route meets a <b>caution</b> <b>light</b> and turns to the right and heads northwest. It continues through a residential area passing multiple streets lined with houses before coming to its eastern terminus at KY 43/KY 55 Business.|$|E
5000|$|The 33 was run as an RCR {{entry for}} the first two races of 2014 with Brian Scott and family {{sponsors}} Shore Lodge and Whitetail Club. Timmy Hill drove the next two races for Circle Sport. Hill was involved in a controversial wreck at Bristol immediately following an accident. Hill was running in last place, when Matt Kenseth (in second place at the time), checked up for a wreck in front of him. Hill did not see the <b>caution</b> <b>lights</b> and did not cut his speed, smashing into Kenseth's back bumper at high speed. Fox analyst Darrell Waltrip first stated in a harsh tone [...] "Good grief.", and then called it a [...] "rookie mistake" [...] for Hill (who had run for rookie of the year in 2013), though he slightly recanted his harsh tone later in the broadcast.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second major}} crash {{in two days}} occurred, this time {{involving}} Nelson Piquet. In turn four, Piquet's car did a reverse spin, and hit the wall head-on with the nose. Piquet suffered serious injuries to both legs, and was immediately {{admitted to the hospital}} for surgery. Piquet withdrew and would require nearly a year of rehabilitation. Piquet had been acclimating himself quite well to the Speedway, but was reportedly frustrated with the frequency of <b>caution</b> <b>lights</b> during the practice sessions. A metal piece of debris was reported on the backstretch, prompting USAC to turn on the yellow. Piquet, {{in the middle of a}} [...] "hot lap", momentarily ignored the yellow light, and raced through turn three and the northchute. In turn four, he lifted off the throttle quickly to enter the pits, at which time the car snapped out of control.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the yellow}} flag is {{displayed}} {{and the yellow}} <b>caution</b> <b>lights</b> around the track come on, the field is frozen immediately {{at the moment of}} caution. All scoring ends immediately and cars are to slow to pace vehicle [...] (safety car) speed. Cars will line up behind the pace vehicle in the order in which they passed the last scoring loop on track (there are as many as 18 loops around the track, although the one at the start/finish line {{is the only one that}} counts for official race statistics). The exception to this rule is if the yellow flag waves after the white flag is thrown (or, in the case of an overtime attempt, if the yellow flag waves after the race leader has crossed the overtime line) or if the race will not be restarted (typically for rain; but sometimes for darkness if a track does not have night lights), in which case NASCAR will use video evidence to determine the finishing order.|$|R
50|$|Jim Rathmann {{took the}} lead at the start and led the first lap. Rodger Ward {{took the lead}} and led laps 2-4, with the two car battling wheel to wheel. On lap 5, Ward was leading the race when he lost control in turn two. The car spun around twice, and was clipped by Bob Christie. The car was not seriously damaged, and Ward was not injured. The yellow <b>caution</b> <b>light</b> was on for six laps {{to clean up the}} incident.|$|E
50|$|NOTE: Some {{media outlets}} {{reported}} that Newman {{was the new}} point leader by one point over Stewart after the race. NASCAR scoring freezes immediately upon a caution being signaled, and a caution was signaled on Lap 190 of 188 (the race was extended because of a late-race caution) midway through the lap after a crash. Under NASCAR rules for late-race situations, video of the race is used with the AMB timing system intermediates to determine final placings. Stewart was ahead of Newman by two places when the <b>caution</b> <b>light</b> was signaled.|$|E
50|$|On lap 170, Gary Bettenhausen's right rear hub {{exploded}} and he {{lost the}} wheel down the mainstretch. Precariously riding on three wheels, he skillfully managed to keep the car mostly off the wall, {{and was able to}} park the car down in the infield of turn one. The <b>caution</b> <b>light</b> came on for the debris, and leader Bobby Unser ducked into the pits for a quick stop (fuel only). Second place Johnny Rutherford also made a pit stop. A minor fire broke out in Dick Simon's pit, but it was quickly doused.|$|E
5000|$|The race {{restarted}} with 39 laps to go, with Edwards {{still at}} the head of the race, and remained so until the eleventh caution of the race flew with three laps to go after the manual override switch in the flag stand was activated, which turned on the <b>caution</b> <b>lights.</b> NASCAR vice-president of competition Robin Pemberton stated after the race that the organization [...] "were scanning cars and spotters, and there's some of us in the tower that only heard it after the teams were talking about it because we were looking at other things around the racetrack". He added that the situation was where NASCAR “learn a lot of lessons, and when we learn a lesson like this we'll go in and further investigate some things" [...] and that [...] "there's probably some things that we needed to do to better secure that area where the manual override is on the lights".|$|R
50|$|Allmendinger's lead of 1.2 seconds {{was reduced}} to nothing when the pace car was on track for the first caution. It was given because a cover for one of a <b>caution</b> <b>light's</b> cover had loosened. When the drivers made pit stops, Allmendinger {{remained}} the leader, but Johnson lost three positions, falling to fifth. Tony Stewart was the only team to change only two tires, which resulted him {{to move toward the}} front of the grid. However, once the race resumed he was losing positions quickly. Gordon, who started fifteenth, had gained seven positions to eighth by lap 47. The second caution followed three laps later because David Reutimann collided into the wall after contact from Newman. Reutimann's car sustained only minor damages. Kevin Harvick went to pit road under the caution, in which afterward his rear tire changer fell and hurt his wrist. Allmendinger led on the restart, ahead of Martin Truex, Jr. in second. On lap 61, Montoya moved into the third position after passing Greg Biffle.|$|R
50|$|Contraindications {{to light}} therapy for {{seasonal}} affective disorder include conditions that might render the eyes more vulnerable to phototoxicity, tendency toward mania, photosensitive skin conditions, or use of a photosensitizing herb (such as St. John's wort) or medication. Patients with porphyria should avoid most forms of light therapy. Patients on certain drugs such as methotrexate or chloroquine should use <b>caution</b> with <b>light</b> therapy {{as there is a}} chance that these drugs could cause porphyria.|$|R
50|$|He {{devised a}} durable metal stoplight, using the {{smokestack}} {{from an old}} locomotive engine for the frame, but without a yellow <b>caution</b> <b>light.</b> He thought of having it patented, but ended up not doing so. Some believed the reason to be that Wire had been drafted to serve in World War I, and {{could not see the}} patent process through. Five years after Wire's invention, Salt Lake City became the first interconnected traffic signal system in the United States. Based on Wire's designs the lights were first installed on August 5, 1914 in Cleveland, Ohio on the corner of East 105th street and Euclid Avenue.|$|E
50|$|Richard Sandomir {{wrote that}} Harris and Goodyear faltered in three {{distinct}} instances {{late in the}} race. With 13 laps to go, they closely examined Dan Wheldon taking the lead by {{the nose of the}} car at the line repeatedly when a caution came out. It was portrayed as if they were racing back to the caution. However, such was not allowed under Indy Racing League rules. It was later observed that the <b>caution</b> <b>light</b> did not turn on until the cars were in turn 1 (well after Wheldon had completed the pass), and the attention focused at the start-finish line was misguided, misleading, and irrelevant.|$|E
5000|$|In the pits, Barry Green {{immediately}} {{challenged the}} decision. He told Tracy over the two-way radio {{that there was}} [...] "a problem," [...] and later chimed sarcastically that [...] "they (presumably IRL officials) {{are not going to}} let one of us (one of the CART teams) win." [...] He contended that Tracy said he had completed the pass before the yellow <b>caution</b> <b>light</b> came on. Tracy said [...] "I feel that I was ahead of him when it went yellow. I passed him, and I saw green. We’re going to protest this thing because I was ahead of him when the yellow came out." ...|$|E
5|$|As Felice {{neared the}} coast, gale {{warnings}} were hoisted from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Galveston, while a hurricane watch extended from Morgan City to Port O'Connor, Texas. Small craft advisories were also posted, <b>cautioning</b> <b>light</b> vessels {{to remain in}} port. All coastal advisories were discontinued by {{the early hours of}} September 16. Residents {{in the path of the}} storm generally evacuated in a timely manner. Over 3,000 fled the storm in Cameron Parish, Louisiana; around half of the residents in the low-lying southern part of the parish had already left before the mandatory evacuation was ordered. Farther west, one of two evacuation routes out of Sabine Pass, Texas had been rendered unusable a few days before the storm when a bridge was damaged in a maritime accident. As the remaining highway was considered susceptible to coastal flooding, officials quickly worked to evacuate 1,300 people in Sabine Pass before the storm's approach. The American Red Cross converted nine public schools into temporary storm shelters in and around Beaumont. Shelters were also set up in Houston and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, though they went mostly unused. The post offices in Sabine Pass, Gilchrist, and Port Bolivar transferred money orders, first-class parcels and postage stamps to the Beaumont office as a safety precaution.|$|R
5000|$|DESCRIPTION: Due {{to work in}} progress, taxiway [...] "B South" [...] {{is closed}} between [...] "F" [...] and [...] "R". Taxiway [...] "R" [...] is closed between [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] and is {{diverted}} via a new green centre line and blue edge <b>lighting.</b> <b>Caution</b> advised.|$|R
50|$|In Austria, Cambodia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia, most of Israel, Malaysia, {{parts of}} Mexico, Turkey, and in certain {{other parts of}} Europe, the green lights will start {{flashing}} {{at the end of}} the Go or Turn phase to indicate that the yellow (<b>Caution</b> phase) <b>lights</b> are about to be engaged. This is useful in fast paced roads to allow for longer slowing down time, and for pedestrians crossing broad streets. Some traffic lights in Pennsylvania illuminate the yellow light a few seconds before the green light turns off, to give this same warning.|$|R
