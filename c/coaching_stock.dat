5|$|The <b>coaching</b> <b>stock</b> was {{extremely}} solidly constructed, and offered levels of accommodation {{far in advance}} of anything else at the time - certainly compared to any other narrow gauge railway. Almost 70 years later, the design {{was used as the}} basis for a new rake of carriages built by the Ffestiniog - testament to the excellence of the original design.|$|E
5|$|The NSR <b>coaching</b> <b>stock</b> was, even until grouping, {{predominantly}} {{four and}} six wheeled vehicles. Four-wheeled carriages were the norm {{from the start}} and the last were constructed in the 1880s, although by then they had progressed from the unbraked coaches of the 1840s {{with the introduction of}} the communication cord in 1869 and the simple vacuum brake in 1883. The first bogie coaches were introduced in 1906 for use on the Derby–Llandudno service and these were followed by further examples until 1923. By 1919 all carriages, except 13 four-wheelers used on miners trains, had been fitted with steam heating and a number of vehicles had been fitted with through pipes to allow use in trains equipped with Westinghouse brakes. Most carriages were constructed at Stoke but some were purchased from companies such as the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company.|$|E

50|$|In May 1991, Norway High's {{baseball}} tradition {{ended on}} a triumphant but somber note as it wins its 20th state championship {{in its final}} season. A video clip of actual <b>coach</b> Kent <b>Stock</b> thanking Van Scoyoc publicly for the opportunity opens the final scene.|$|R

25|$|Corridor <b>coaching</b> <b>stock</b> was {{originally}} trialled in carmine and white (nicknamed Plum and Spilt Milk) before Crimson Lake and Cream livery (nicknamed Blood and Custard) was adopted across the network; non-corridor stock was painted plain Crimson Lake.|$|E
25|$|Diesel {{multiple}} units were serviced in another open ended shed {{next to the}} carriage cleaning tracks. This shed was subsequently used to repair the electric train {{heating and air conditioning}} on the new Mark 3 and Mark 4 <b>coaching</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{renumbering}} of the 400xx series catering {{vehicles in}} 1983 was to avoid their numbers clashing with the Class 40 diesel loco fleet (numbered 40 001 to 40 199) when BR's loco (TOPS) and <b>coaching</b> <b>stock</b> number series were merged.|$|E

25|$|Doubts {{were raised}} about safety after the Winsford crash, which {{involved}} an empty First North Western Class 142 colliding with a Virgin Trains Class 87 and <b>coaching</b> <b>stock</b> at Winsford, Cheshire on the West Coast Main Line. The {{body of the}} Pacer was severed from its frames, causing severe internal damage, which caused the unit to be written off.|$|E

After a lengthy refurbishment, 86401 joined the Caledonian Sleeper fleet on 8 August 2015.|$|E
25|$|The units {{continued}} to be used on these services until mid-2004, when the hire period ended. They were transferred south in two batches, and were replaced on the North Berwick branch by EWS Class 90 electric locomotives hauling former Virgin Trains Mk.3 <b>coaching</b> <b>stock.</b> To enable trains to reverse, the locomotive operates in push-pull mode with a Driving Van Trailer.|$|E
25|$|The first {{break in}} the {{uniformity}} of Rail Blue came in 1976 {{with the introduction of}} the first InterCity 125 (HST). The distinctive angular shape of the HST power cars did not lend itself to applying yellow on the leading face, so the yellow was wrapped around and extended along the side of each power car, although the coaches retained the usual Rail Blue <b>coaching</b> <b>stock</b> livery.|$|E
