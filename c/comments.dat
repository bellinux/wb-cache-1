5|$|Australia's manager Frank Farina criticised the {{qualification}} {{format and}} questioned {{the need for}} these kind of matches. Archie Thompson, who scored a record-setting 13 goals, was delighted with his record, but he also agreed with Farina's <b>comments.</b> FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper agreed with both <b>comments</b> and suggested {{a change in the}} qualification format, with the smaller teams entering a preliminary round. However, Oceania Football Confederation chairman Basil Scarsella, opposed both <b>comments</b> and claimed that the smaller teams have the right to face Australia and New Zealand, similar to Australia having the rights to face stronger opponents such as Brazil and France.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} important SEC <b>comment</b> letters and examine the mechanisms by which they affect firm value. The SEC periodically reviews public-company financial statements, issuing <b>comment</b> letters in response to disclosure deficiencies, to ensure that investors are provided with material information, and to prevent fraud. Given that <b>comment</b> letters consist of unstructured text, statistical text classification may be an effective technique to identify <b>comment</b> letter importance. The information in <b>comment</b> letters is distributed over several separate filings and they are not widely cited by the press or analysts as information sources, which may result in investor inattention and underreaction to their disclosure. I utilize negative abnormal returns following <b>comment</b> letter disclosure as the primary indicator of <b>comment</b> letter importance, and develop a Naive Bayesian classification model that signals important <b>comment</b> letters from their text features that are associated with the indicator. In a holdout sample, the text classification model correctly identifies important <b>comment</b> letters between 10 and 40 percent better than chance. The average out-of-sample abnormal return for firms with signaled <b>comment</b> letters is - 5. 8 percent during the 90 days post-disclosure, but only when the <b>comment</b> letters were viewed on EDGAR. Signaled <b>comment</b> letters are associated with lower persistence of profits and increased material restatements in the year following <b>comment</b> letter disclosure...|$|R

5|$|Yagan's skull {{was handed}} over to the Noongar {{delegation}} at a ceremony at Liverpool Town Hall on 31 August 1997. In accepting the skull, Colbung made <b>comments</b> that were interpreted as linking Yagan's death with the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, earlier that day: That is how nature goes... Nature is a carrier of all good things and all bad things. And because the Poms did the wrong thing, they now have to suffer. Colbung's <b>comments</b> prompted a media furore throughout Australia, with newspapers receiving many letters from the public expressing shock and anger at the <b>comments.</b> Colbung later claimed that his <b>comments</b> had been misinterpreted.|$|E

40|$|It will {{be shown}} that the <b>comment</b> [1] {{contains}} numerous errors, misconceptions, inaccuracies, false assumptions, misunderstandings and unjustified claims. The analysis of the <b>comment</b> is built on a false assumption that the terminal current of an antenna fed by a waveguide is independent of frequency. This false assumption arises from the misunderstandings on the basic theory of transmission lines and misconceptions of normalization for a linear system. As a result, all the equations obtained from the assumption in the <b>comment</b> are incorrect, and the related discussions are untruthful. The delta gap source modeling has been abused in the <b>comment,</b> and this {{is reflected in the}} numerical results in the <b>comment</b> that give rise to negative stored energy. The main results of the <b>commented</b> paper have been misinterpreted by the authors of the <b>comment,</b> and the related analysis is established on illogical reasoning. The <b>comment</b> fails to pinpoint any errors in the <b>commented</b> paper. Instead, it reveals that the main results obtained by the authors of the <b>comment</b> in their previous publication [2] are incorrect. Comment: 5 page...|$|R
25|$|The related {{concept of}} {{maternal}} mind-mindedness assesses the mother's {{ability to understand}} and verbalize the infant's mind: thoughts, desires, intentions and memories. Maternal mind-mindedness {{has been found to}} be related to some developmental results, such as attachment security. A caregiver's <b>comment</b> is deemed an appropriate mind-related <b>comment</b> if the <b>comment</b> was deemed to match the infant's behaviour by the independent coder, if the <b>comment</b> associated the infant's current activity to past activities, and/or if the <b>comment</b> encouraged the infant to go on with his or her intentions when the conversation paused. This correlates to high maternal mind-mindedness. If the caregiver assigns the wrong internal state to the baby's behaviour, if the <b>comment</b> about the current activity is not insufficiently associated with a past event, if the <b>comment</b> deters the infant from proceeding with the current activity, and/or if the <b>comment</b> is unclear, it is deemed a in-appropriate mind-related <b>comment</b> and correlates to low mind-mindedness.|$|R
