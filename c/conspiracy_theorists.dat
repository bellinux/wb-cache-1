5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} the demonization of Western esotericism by <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theorists</b> is rooted in {{religious}} intolerance {{but also in the}} same moral panics that have fueled witch trials in the Early Modern period, and satanic ritual abuse allegations in the United States.|$|E
5|$|<b>Conspiracy</b> <b>theorists</b> {{concerned}} with surveillance abuse {{believe that the}} New World Order is being implemented by the cult of intelligence {{at the core of}} the surveillance-industrial complex through mass surveillance and the use of Social Security numbers, the bar-coding of retail goods with Universal Product Code markings, and, most recently, RFID tagging by microchip implants.|$|E

5|$|<b>Conspiracy</b> <b>theorists</b> {{have long}} {{associated}} Freemasonry with the New World Order and the Illuminati, and state that Freemasonry as an organisation is either bent on world domination or already secretly {{in control of}} world politics. Historically, Freemasonry has attracted criticism—and suppression—from both the politically far right (e.g., Nazi Germany) and the far left (e.g. the former Communist states in Eastern Europe).|$|E
5|$|Democratic transhumanists, such as American {{sociologist}} James Hughes, {{counter that}} many influential {{members of the}} United States Establishment are bioconservatives strongly opposed to human enhancement, as demonstrated by President Bush's Council on Bioethics's proposed international treaty prohibiting human cloning and germline engineering. Furthermore, he argues that <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theorists</b> underestimate how fringe the transhumanist movement really is.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} the {{connection}} of <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theorists</b> and occultists follows from their common fallacious premises. First, any widely accepted belief must necessarily be false. Second, stigmatized knowledge—what the Establishment spurns—must be true. The result is a large, self-referential network in which, for example, some UFO religionists promote anti-Jewish phobias while some antisemites practice Peruvian shamanism.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} conclusions {{were still}} being debated by academics and <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theorists</b> more than 50 years after the assassination. One such theorist, Texas author Jim Marrs, wrote that most researchers were ready to accept Lovelady as the man in Altgens' photograph. He later wrote that others were resisting any such acceptance.|$|E
5|$|Back in Washington, D.C., Mulder {{introduces}} Scully to the Lone Gunmen, {{a trio of}} eccentric <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theorists</b> {{with whom}} he collaborates. After returning to FBI headquarters, Scully discovers a surveillance device within her pen. Mulder meets with Deep Throat, who provides him with documentation of an intercepted Iraqi transmission regarding the downed UFO. Scully continues to investigate the Tennessee incident, learning that two thousand pounds of extra weight had been added to Ranheim's truck. She also learns Ranheim's true identity as Frank Druce.|$|E
5|$|For example, in March 2009, as {{a result}} of the late-2000s {{financial}} crisis, the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation pressed for urgent consideration of a new international reserve currency and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development proposed greatly expanding the I.M.F.'s special drawing rights. <b>Conspiracy</b> <b>theorists</b> fear these proposals are a call for the U.S. to adopt a single global currency for a New World Order.|$|E

5|$|Nominally {{based in}} Alaska, the Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX-1) arrived on Ford Island in 2006 for {{maintenance}} and repairs and has returned several times since. Primarily used as a warhead-detection radar system on a self-propelled floating platform in the Pacific, its presence on the island has been controversial. The platform, with a cost reaching nearly , has never actually made it to Alaska and <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theorists</b> argue that the platform is a mobile version of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theorists</b> grossly {{overestimate}} {{the influence of}} ex-Nazis and neo-Nazis on American society, and point out that political repression at home and imperialism abroad {{have a long history}} in the United States that predates the 20th century. Some political scientists, such as Sheldon Wolin, have expressed concern that the twin forces of democratic deficit and superpower status have paved the way in the U.S. for the emergence of an inverted totalitarianism which contradicts many principles of Nazism.|$|E
5|$|These <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theorists,</b> {{who are all}} strong {{believers in}} a {{right to keep and}} bear arms, are {{extremely}} fearful that the passing of any gun control legislation will be later followed by the abolishment of personal gun ownership and a campaign of gun confiscation, and that the refugee camps of emergency management agencies such as FEMA will be used for the internment of suspected subversives, making little effort to distinguish true threats to the New World Order from pacifist dissidents.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} a cause célèbre {{from the late}} 1960s to the 1980s, the mythical Priory of Sion was exposed as a ludibrium created by Plantard {{as a framework for}} his claim of being the Great Monarch prophesied by Nostradamus. Evidence presented in support of its historical existence and activities before 1956 was discovered to have been forged and then planted in various locations around France by Plantard and his accomplices. Nevertheless, many <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theorists</b> still persist in believing that the Priory of Sion is an age-old cabal that conceals a subversive secret.|$|E
5|$|Before year 2000 some survivalists wrongly {{believed}} this process {{would be set}} in motion by the predicted Y2K problem causing societal collapse. Since many left-wing and right-wing <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theorists</b> believe that the September 11 attacks were a false flag operation carried out by the United States intelligence community, as part of a strategy of tension to justify political repression at home and preemptive war abroad, they have become convinced that a more catastrophic terrorist incident will be responsible for triggering Executive Directive 51 in order to complete the transition to a police state.|$|E
5|$|<b>Conspiracy</b> <b>theorists</b> {{generally}} {{speculate that}} the New World Order is being implemented gradually, citing {{the formation of the}} U.S. Federal Reserve System in 1913; the League of Nations in 1919; the International Monetary Fund in 1944; the United Nations in 1945; the World Bank in 1945; the World Health Organization in 1948; the European Union and the euro currency in 1993; the World Trade Organization in 1998; the African Union in 2002; and the Union of South American Nations in 2008 as major milestones.|$|E

5|$|In late April 2013 Earl Cossey, {{the owner}} of the skydiving school that {{furnished}} the four parachutes given to Cooper, was found dead in his home in Woodinville, a suburb of Seattle. His death was ruled a homicide due to blunt-force trauma to the head. The perpetrator remains unknown. <b>Conspiracy</b> <b>theorists</b> immediately began pointing out possible links to the Cooper case, but authorities responded that they {{have no reason to believe}} that any such link exists. Woodinville officials later announced that the most likely motive for the crime was burglary.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the day of}} the accident, {{there was}} {{uncertainty}} about who boarded the plane and about the exact cargo manifest—all leading to uncertainty as to the identity of the bodies recovered from the crash site; some bodies, including that of Sikorski's daughter, Zofia, were never recovered. Since several bodies were never found and the bodies of several members of Sikorski's entourage were never positively identified, some <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theorists</b> such as journalist and amateur historian Dariusz Baliszewski postulate that some might have been murdered on the ground while others might have been abducted to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|An {{increasingly}} popular conspiracy theory among American right-wing populists {{is that the}} hypothetical North American Union and the amero currency, proposed by the Council on Foreign Relations and its counterparts in Mexico and Canada, {{will be the next}} milestone in the implementation of the New World Order. The theory holds that a group of shadowy and mostly nameless international elites are planning to replace the federal government of the United States with a transnational government. Therefore, <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theorists</b> believe the borders between Mexico, Canada and the United States {{are in the process of}} being erased, covertly, by a group of globalists whose ultimate goal is to replace national governments in Washington, D.C., Ottawa and Mexico City with a European-style political union and a bloated E.U.-style bureaucracy.|$|E
