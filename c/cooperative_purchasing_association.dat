40|$|Our main {{objective}} is to classify different forms of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing,</b> i. e. purchasing groups. Based on a literature review, empirical findings, and new institutional economics we employ a classification: the highway matrix. In this matrix we distinguish five forms of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> according to the ‘influence by all members on the group activities’ and the ‘number of different group activities’. The classification {{can serve as a}} guideline for (potential) purchasing groups when a suitable form needs to be chosen. Managerial implications of a classification include an emphasis on differences in organisational structure and critical factors. Research implications include an emphasis on the importance of using a classification, as different forms of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> imply different models and mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Procurement is {{considered}} to be a promising area for lowering the costs in the health care sector. Estimates of savings on purchasing prices are 10 to 15 % (Nollet & Beaulieu, 2005). In addition, there may be up to more than 40 % cost savings on the administrative purchasing costs (Schneller, 2000). <b>Cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> is a relatively new strategy aimed at reducing costs in healthcare. Purchasing cooperation initiatives frequently fail. Previous studies have tried to explain the failures of purchasing groups. However, these studies report mixed findings and call for further research. Most studies on <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> are qualitative and explorative by nature, which limits their generalizability. By contrast, the present study is set up as a quantitative research aimed at explaining the (lack of) success of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> in healthcare. The problem statement is: How can we explain the success of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> in healthcare? The literature review resulted in a theoretical framework that includes six hypotheses, mostly derived from Transaction Cost Economics (TCE). Trust, commitment, group formality, IT systems, communication, and teamwork skills were believed to have a significant impact on the success of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing.</b> The framework includes another set of two hypotheses where a moderating effect of trust and commitment was expected on the relationship between group formality and success. E-mail invitations for a questionnaire were sent to 69 hospitals, active in <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing,</b> covering a total of 17 purchasing groups. A total of 88 valid responses were obtained for the statistical analysis, corresponding to an estimated effective response rate of 24 %. Based on the results of a factor analysis, the Teamwork skills construct was divided in two sub-constructs: “teamwork skills-ideas” (relating to the capability of a team to form and execute plans and ideas) and “teamwork skills-conflict” (relating to the capability of a team to resolve conflicts). The results of a stepwise regression analysis indicated a significant impact of trust, IT systems, and teamwork skills-conflicts on the success of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing.</b> Congruently with most previous studies, trust appears to be the most important factor explaining success. No former study explicitly researched the effect of IT systems on <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing.</b> The results of this study suggest the need for good and effective IT systems for the tactical <b>purchasing</b> process of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing.</b> Apparently, conflict resolution is pivotal for managing a successful purchasing group. This part of teamwork skills was also not addressed before in literature on <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing.</b> In <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> groups, there are many situations potentially leading to conflicts, such as, for example, the allocation of savings, time, and costs (Schotanus et al., 2010). Self-interest and opportunism will cause conflicts. Quick resolution of conflicts is found to be very important in the present study. The present study has some limitations that could be seen as a point of departure for further research. The sample size was relatively small and only perceptions have been measured. Further research could try to incorporate, for instance, financial data in their analysis. Our study suffered from a number of measurement problems limiting the generalizability and validity of the findings. Future research could try to work with more reliable constructs and attempt to find other explanatory variables and/or other (direct and moderating) effects. Finally, future studies within the healthcare sector could investigate other types of organizations beyond hospitals. It would be interesting to replicate the results of the present study in other parts of the public sector, the private sector, both in the Netherlands and abroad...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} research {{interests in the}} <b>purchasing</b> group, <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> in {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) has not received significant attention from the operations and supply chain management researcher. This study investigates the typical advantages of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> for SME retailers, and critical success factors for managing a purchasing group, using a case study of a purchasing group established by Chinese SME retailers. The study suggests that a successful purchasing group can help SME retailers to survive in today's competitive marketplace. The main advantages of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> for SME retailers are lower purchasing prices, mutual learning and support, dealing with illegal bribes, and quality improvement. The success factors for SME retailers to manage a purchasing group are good guanxi (personal and business relationships) among group members, similar characteristics of group members, similar personality traits of top executives, and the role of a big brother (group leader) in the group. This study also provides practical insights for retail managers to consider when developing a purchasing group in dynamic environments, in order to achieve the benefits of <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing.</b> Â© 2014 Springer-Verlag London.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} {{a new class}} of interactive <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> situations and provides an explicit alternative characterization of the nucleolus of cooperative games, which offers an alternative to Kohlberg (1971). In our <b>cooperative</b> <b>purchasing</b> situation, the unit price of a commodity depends on the largest order quantity within a cooperating group of players. Due to a decreasing unit price function, players can obtain cost savings by purchasing cooperatively. However, to establish fruitful cooperation a decision has to be made about an adequate allocation of the corresponding cost savings. We analyze Maximum <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Purchasing</b> (MCP) -situation from the perspective of allocation by defining corresponding cooperative MCP-games. It turns out that in an MCP-game all coalitional values can be determined from the values of two-player coalitions. Moreover, it is shown that a decreasing unit price function is a sufficient condition for a non-empty core: the Direct Price solution is both a core element and a marginal vector. It is seen that the nucleolus of an MCP-game can be derived in polynomial time from the Direct Price solution, using a socalled nucleolus determinant. To show this result, the explicit alternative characterization of the nucleolus is used. Using the decomposition of an MCP-game into unanimity games we find an explicit expression for the Shapley value. Interestingly, the Shapley value can be interpreted as a specific tax and subsidize system. Finally, the behavior of the three solution concepts is compared numerically. ...|$|R
