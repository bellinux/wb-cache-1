50|$|Chlorinated {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} are generated by combustion of organic compounds. Cl-PAHs enter the environment from a multiplicity of sources and tend to persist in soil and in particulate matter in air. Environmental data and emission sources analysis for Cl-PAHs reveal that the dominant process of generation is by reaction of PAHs with chlorine in pyrosynthesis. Cl-PAHs have commonly been detected in tap water, fly ash from an incineration plant for radioactive waste, emissions from coal combustion and municipal waste incineration, automobile exhaust, snow, and urban air. They have also been detected in electronic wastes, workshop-floor dust, vegetation, and surface soil collected from the vicinity of an electronic waste (e-waste) recycling facility and in surface soil from a chemical industrial complex (comprising a <b>coke-oven</b> <b>plant,</b> a coal-fired power plant, and a chlor-alkali plant), and agricultural areas {{in central and eastern}} China. In addition, the combustion of polyvinylchloride and plastic wrap made from polyvinylidene chloride result in the production of Cl-PAHs, suggesting that combustion of organic materials including chlorine is a possible source of environmental pollution.|$|E

Simplified physical and mathematical models were developed and calculated, based {{on which the}} rules of coal thawing were obtained. By analyzing effects of wind temperature and wind speed on thawing, thawing time of frozen coal under different conditions was calculated, which can provide reference for accurate design and actual operating...|$|E
40|$|The steel company SSAB in Oxelösund, Sweden {{operates}} a <b>coke-oven</b> <b>plant</b> {{and has since}} a long time operated an activated sludge plant for treatment of effluent water. Along with more stringent requirements on discharge quality, especially focusing on nitrogen compounds and a new consent value for total nitrogen discharge (< 30 ppm of total N) the company decided to operate a pilot plant facility to investigate two major issues: 1) To define the conditions and restrictions for nitrification of ammonia nitrogen in the water; 2) To find out how efficiently a denitrification would perform. In order to find {{answers to these questions}} SSAB hired a pilot plant for testing. The test facility is based on a single sludge activated sludge reactor system for biological nutrient removal, with a reactor volume of 3. 8 m 3. After a test period of 5 months it was possible to draw reliable conclusions regarding the performance. The untreated wastewater has a high content of total nitrogen, around 240 ppm. The major nitrogen part is ammonia nitrogen, but an important fraction is found as thiocyanate nitrogen. The following main conclusions were drawn from the test operation: · It was found to be crucial that the solids retention time (SRT) was kept at a sufficiently high level. During the successful operation the SRT was in the range of 40 - 50 days; · It is desirable to have an equalization basin upstream the main biological reactor to meet short time peak loads, defined as both flow and pollution; · The major toxic risks for the biological process were high thiocyanate and ammonia concentrations in the raw wastewater; · The system showed however a good microbiological capacity to acclimatize to the prevailing conditions after the needed time; · The tests did not include an optimization of the oxygen supply with respect to nitrification; however it was evident that the oxygen level was sufficient to maintain a complete nitrification at normal operating conditions; · Once the nitrification was established it was also possible to reach a high degree of denitrification—as long as an external carbon source was applied; · It was found that both the cyanide nitrogen and especially the thiocyanate nitrogen were reduced by the process. The cyanide reduction is probably related both to precipitation by ferrous ions and biological transformation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the reaction pathway and kinetics of thiocyanate (SCN-) degradation during mixed culture (activated sludge) treatment of coke-ovens wastewater. The effect of phenol and cyanide, both present in coke-ovens wastewater, on thiocyanate degradation was also to be determined. Two 6 L perspex sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were operated continuously for a period of 12 months, fed with coke-ovens wastewater from Port Kembla Steel Works. The results from 18 experimental periods are presented. The degradation of thiocyanate has been quantified by identification of specific rates of removal and oxygen uptake rate. The results indicate that thiocyanate is removed via microbial growth using thiocyanate as a substrate, and that S 0 (4) (2 -), NH 4 + and CO 2 are the reaction products. Oxygen uptake rate data and sulphur and nitrogen balances indicate that this reaction was occurring. None of the results obtained showed inhibition of thiocyanate degradation due to phenol. However, phenol was degraded much quicker than thiocyanate, and thus phenol inhibition in <b>coke-ovens</b> wastewater treatment <b>plants,</b> even if it does occur, {{is not likely to be}} a significant issue. In contrast, cyanide has been found to have a significant inhibitory effect on the degradation of thiocyanate. This work suggests that thiocyanate removal may be totally inhibited in coke-ovens wastewater at concentrations of CN- in excess of 1 mg/L. Thiocyanate degradation is the slowest and most sensitive process, compared with the removal of phenol and cyanide, and will be the determining factor when identifying the hydraulic residence time required for treatment of coke-ovens wastewater (excluding nitrification).
