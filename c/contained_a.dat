In this paper, necessary and sufficient {{conditions for a}} Banach space to <b>contain</b> <b>an</b> asymptotically isometric copy of l_p(1 ≤ p <∞) or c_ 0 are given by the dual action. In particular, it is shown that <b>a</b> Banach space <b>contains</b> <b>an</b> asymptotically isometric copy of l_ 1 if its dual space <b>contains</b> <b>an</b> isometric copy of l_∞, and if <b>a</b> Banach space <b>contains</b> <b>an</b> asymptotically isometric copy of c_ 0, then its dual space <b>contains</b> <b>an</b> asymptotically isometric copy of l_ 1...|$|R

5|$|Though {{often used}} interchangeably, in biology these words have {{different}} meanings. Fish {{is used as}} a singular noun, or as a plural to describe multiple individuals from a single species. Fishes is used to describe different species or species groups. Thus a pond that <b>contained</b> <b>a</b> single species might be said to contain 120 fish. But if the pond <b>contained</b> <b>a</b> total of 120 fish from three different species, it would be said to contain three fishes. The distinction is similar to that between people and peoples.|$|E
