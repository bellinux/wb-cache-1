Even at 17.5 yards away and with the dog outside a <b>closed</b> <b>window,</b> the noise level of a barking dog can be well over the level that causes psychological distress. Different kinds of barking often require different kinds of approach to reduction.|$|E

60|$|Our {{proceedings}} {{of that first}} morning did little to advance the investigation. It was marked, however, at the outset by an incident which left the most sinister impression upon my mind. The approach to the spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a narrow, winding, country lane. While {{we made our way}} along it we heard the rattle of a carriage coming towards us and stood aside to let it pass. As it drove by us I caught a glimpse through the <b>closed</b> <b>window</b> of a horribly contorted, grinning face glaring out at us. Those staring eyes and gnashing teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vision.|$|E
60|$|Indignant, but {{believing that}} the unfortunate man was still in fear of {{persecution}} from the mischievous urchins whom I had evidently just interrupted, I put down my pen {{and went over to}} him. Here I discovered, to my surprise and mortification, that his long pigtail was held hard and fast by the <b>closed</b> <b>window</b> behind him which the young rascals had shut down upon it, after having first noiselessly fished it outside with a hook and line. I apologized, opened the window, and released him. He did not complain, although he must have been fixed in that uncomfortable position for some minutes, but plunged at once into the business that brought him there.|$|E

60|$|In {{the long}} room up-stairs he found Adrian Urmand {{sitting at the}} <b>closed</b> <b>window,</b> {{looking out at the}} ducks who were {{paddling}} in a temporary pool made by the late rains. He had been painfully in want of something to do,--so much so that he had more than once almost resolved to put his things into his bag, and leave the house without saying a word of farewell to any one. Had there been any means for him to escape from Granpere without saying a word, he would have done so. But at Granpere there was no railway, and the only public conveyance {{in and out of the}} place started from the door of the Lion d'Or; started every morning, with much ceremony, so that it was impossible for him to fly unobserved. There he was, watching the ducks, when Michel entered the room, and very much disposed to quarrel with any one who approached him.|$|E
6000|$|... "No--pray do. I don't {{want to talk}} to {{you about}} any of my silly scrapes. What are my scrapes? Absolutely nothing. Mere childishness. The other night I flung a fellow out of a certain place where I was having a fairly good time. A tyrannical little beast of a quill-driver from the Treasury department. He was {{bullying}} the people of the house. I rebuked him. 'You are not behaving humanely to God's creatures that are a jolly sight more estimable than yourself,' I said. I can't bear to see any tyranny, Kirylo Sidorovitch. Upon my word I can't. He didn't take it in good part at all. 'Who's that impudent puppy?' he begins to shout. I was in excellent form as it happened, and he went through the <b>closed</b> <b>window</b> very suddenly. He flew quite a long way into the yard. I raged like--like a--minotaur. The women clung to me and screamed, the fiddlers got under the table.... Such fun! My dad had to put his hand pretty deep into his pocket, I can tell you." [...] He chuckled.|$|E
60|$|For Ravenna, however, I {{had nothing}} but smiles--grave, reflective, philosophic smiles, I hasten to add, such as accord with the {{historic}} dignity, {{not to say the}} mortal sunny sadness, of the place. I arrived there in the evening, before, even at drowsy Ravenna, the festa of the Statuto had altogether put itself to bed. I immediately strolled forth from the inn, and found it sitting up a while longer on the piazza, chiefly at the cafe door, listening to the band of the garrison by the light of a dozen or so of feeble tapers, fastened along the front of the palace of the Government. Before long, however, it had dispersed and departed, and I was left alone with the grey illumination and with an affable citizen whose testimony as to the manners and customs of Ravenna I had aspired to obtain. I had, borrowing confidence from prompt observation, suggested deferentially that it was n't the liveliest place in the world, and my friend admitted that it was in fact not a seat of ardent life. But had I seen the Corso? Without seeing the Corso one did n't exhaust the possibilities. The Corso of Ravenna, of a hot summer night, had an air of surprising seclusion and repose. Here and there in an upper <b>closed</b> <b>window</b> glimmered a light; my companion's footsteps and my own were the only sounds; not a creature was within sight. The suffocating air helped me to believe for a moment that I walked in the Italy of Boccaccio, hand-in-hand with the plague, through a city which had lost half its population by pestilence and the other half by flight. I turned back into my inn profoundly satisfied. This at last was the old-world dulness of a prime distillation; this at last was antiquity, history, repose.|$|E

6000|$|He entered at once. She {{turned and}} {{passed into the}} room {{on the other side}} of the landing. Arnold glanced around him with some curiosity. The room was well {{appointed}} and a luncheon table was laid for four people. There were flowers upon the table, and the glass and cutlery were superior to anything one might have expected from a restaurant in this vicinity. The window looked down into the street. Arnold stood before it for a moment or two. The traffic below was insignificant, but the roar of Oxford Street, only a few yards distant, came to his ears even through the <b>closed</b> <b>window.</b> He listened thoughtfully, and then, before he realized the course his thoughts were taking, he found himself thinking of Ruth. In a certain sense he was superstitious about Ruth and her forebodings. He found himself wondering what she would have said if she could have seen him there and known that it was Fenella who had brought him. And he himself--what did he think of it? A week ago, his life had been so commonplace that his head and his heart had ached with the monotony of it. And now Fenella had come and had shown him already strange things. He seemed to have passed into a world where mysterious happenings were an every-day occurrence, into a world peopled by strange men and women who always carried secrets about with them. And, in a sense, no one was more mysterious than Fenella herself. He asked himself as he stood there whether her vagaries were merely temperamental, the air of mystery which seemed to surround her simply accidental. He thought of that night at her house, the curious intimacy which from the first moment she had seemed to take for granted, the confidence with which she had treated him. He remembered those few breathless moments in her room, the man's hand upon the window-sill, with the strange colored ring, worn with almost flagrant ostentation. And then, with a lightning-like transition of thought, the gleam of the hand with that self-same ring, raised to strike a murderous blow, which he had seen for a moment through the doors of the Milan. The red seal ring upon the finger--what did it mean? A doubt chilled him for a moment. He told himself with passionate insistence, that it was not possible that she could know of these things. Her words were idle, her theories a jest. He turned away from the window and caught up a morning paper, resolved to escape from his thoughts. The first headline stared up at him: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had sent}} a note to Mr. Saul on the {{previous}} evening giving notice of his intended visit, and had received an answer, in which the curate had promised {{that he would be}} at home. He had never been in Mr. Saul's room, and as he entered it, felt more strongly than ever how incongruous was the idea of Mr. Saul as a suitor to his sister. The Claverings had always had things comfortable around them. They were a people who had ever lived on Brussels carpets, and had seated themselves in capacious chairs. Ormolu, damask hangings, and Sevres china were not familiar to them; but they had never lacked anything that is needed for the comfort of the first-class clerical world. Mr. Saul in his abode boasted but few comforts. He inhabited a big bed-room, in which there was a vast fireplace and a very small grate--the grate being very much more modern than the fireplace. There was a small rag of a carpet near the hearth, and on this stood a large deal table--a table made of unalloyed deal, without any mendacious paint, putting forward a pretence in the direction of mahogany. One wooden Windsor arm-chair--very comfortable in its way--was appropriated to the use of Mr. Saul himself; and two other small wooden chairs flanked {{the other side of the}} fireplace. In one distant corner stood Mr. Saul's small bed, and in another distant corner stood his small dressing-table. Against the wall stood a ricketty deal press in which he kept his clothes. Other furniture there was none. One of the large windows facing toward the farmyard had been permanently closed, and in the wide embrasure was placed a portion of Mr. Saul's library--books which he had brought with him from college; and on the ground under this <b>closed</b> <b>window</b> were arranged the others, making a long row, which stretched from the bed to the dressing-table, very pervious, I fear, to the attacks of mice. The big table near the fireplace was covered with books and papers--and, alas, with dust; for he had fallen into that terrible habit which prevails among bachelors, of allowing his work to remain ever open, never finished, always confused--with papers above books, and books above papers--looking as though no useful product could ever be made to come forth from such chaotic elements. But there Mr. Saul composed his sermons, and studied his Bible, and followed up, no doubt, some special darling pursuit, which his ambition dictated. But there he did not eat his meals; that had been made impossible by the pile of papers and dust; and his chop, therefore, or his broiled rasher, or bit of pig's fry was deposited for him on the little dressing-table, and there consumed.|$|E

40|$|In {{urbanized}} environments {{traffic noise}} is an often debated topic which emerges {{to a serious}} problem. If windows are opened for ventilation, noise also automatically invades. The technical development, evaluated in this work, provides a solution: A window, which reacts to traffic noise in real-time by self-controlled opening and closing. The current work dealt with the quantification of the added value created by this window with respect to measures of perceived loudness and annoyance. Within a laboratory experiment subjects rated perceived loudness and annoyance of several traffic noises with the <b>window</b> opened, <b>closed</b> or automatically closing. The ratings of loudness and annoyance were {{the same for the}} closed and the automatically <b>closing</b> <b>window.</b> In both situations, the traffic noise was rated significantly less loud and annoying as compared to an open window. Moreover we evaluated the efficiency of the automatically <b>closing</b> <b>window</b> in different situations of everyday life. In a relaxed situation (e. g. at home), the traffic was perceived louder and even more annoying compared to the ratings of the same traffic noise in a highly cognitive demanding situation (e. g. at work). In conclusion the automatically <b>closing</b> <b>window</b> provides a considerable additional value compared to conventional windows...|$|R
