5|$|In 1994 {{the firm}} {{acquired}} AudioFile, {{a company that}} specialized in <b>computer-based</b> voice technology. The company created a product called TalkWorks, which enabled users to use certain fax/modems as a voice mail client.|$|E
5|$|A 1982 {{study of}} {{subjects}} who underwent <b>computer-based</b> visual training concluded that any perceived resulting improvement in visual acuity is best explained as a contact lens-like effect of moisture on the eye, based on increased tear action exhibited by 15 out of 17 subjects who experienced such improvement.|$|E
5|$|A {{black hole}} {{could be the}} power source instead of a star in order to {{increase}} the matter-to conversion efficiency. A black hole would also be smaller than a star. This would decrease communication distances that would be important for <b>computer-based</b> societies as those described above.|$|E
5|$|Saville and Fairchild went to Congress in 1950, and {{obtained}} $114million {{for the development}} of an electronic <b>computer-based</b> air defense system, a project headed by George E. Valley Jr, who was a physicist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The computer, named Whirlwind, helped the USAF develop the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air defense system.|$|E
5|$|The {{final scene}} (set 8 months later) shows {{the changes that}} Borat's {{observations}} from America have brought to his village, including the apparent conversion {{of the people to}} Christianity (the Kazakh version of which includes crucifixion and torturing of Jews) and the introduction of <b>computer-based</b> technology, such as iPods, laptop computers and a high-definition, LCD television.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{progress}} in {{hardware and software}} development continued, including projects funded by the European Community. The first commercially available dynamic screen speech generating devices were developed in the 1990s. At the same time synthesized speech was becoming available in more languages. Software programs were developed that allowed the <b>computer-based</b> production of communication boards. High-tech devices have continued to reduce in size and weight, while increasing accessibility and capacities. Modern communication devices can also enable users to access the internet and some {{can be used as}} environmental control devices for independent access of TV, radio, telephone etc.|$|E
5|$|CG {{was also}} used to {{recreate}} the San Francisco neighborhood at Washington and Cherry Streets where cab driver Paul Stine was killed. The area had changed significantly {{over the years and}} residents didn't want the murder to be re-created in their neighborhood, so Fincher shot the six-minute sequence on a bluescreen stage. Production designer Donald Burt gave the visual effects team detailed drawings of the intersection as it was in 1969. Photographs of every possible angle of the area were shot with a high-resolution digital camera, allowing the effects crew to build <b>computer-based</b> geometric models of homes that were then textured with period facades. 3-D vintage police motorcycles, squad cars, a firetruck and street lights were added to the final shot.|$|E
5|$|Family {{studies on}} {{schizophrenia}} were reviewed. That the disorder runs in families did not suggest it was genetically inherited, since cultural transmission occurs from parents to children. Twin and adoption studies were presented {{as the standard}} methods to disentangle contributions from genes and the environment. Gottesman used a <b>computer-based</b> method for calculating the odds of becoming schizophrenic based on the many causes. The book examines the problems caused by schizophrenia for relatives of patients and for society at large, larger-scale ones exemplified by the eugenics policies of states such as Nazi Germany. Two final chapters cover molecular biology and neuroanatomy briefly. Newer methods of behavioral genetics being researched {{at the time of}} publication, such as linkage analysis which used the likelihood of neighboring genes being inherited together, were not covered.|$|E
5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing <b>computer-based</b> technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, BBC archive {{specialist}} James Insell {{established the}} Colour Recovery Working Group, an online project {{to find new}} ways of restoring black-and-white telerecordings to colour. In 2008, Reverse Standards Conversion inventor Richard Russell, developed a technique involving the use of chroma dots embedded in the black-and-white signal to recreate the missing color. This technique was initially used as part of the recolouring process on episode 3 of Planet of the Daleks; the chroma dot process was used alongside a <b>computer-based</b> colourisation process to match together the differing qualities of colour recovery. The process was then used on an entire episode of Dad's Army, showing {{that it was possible to}} use it on entire recordings.|$|E
5|$|More recently, an {{alternative}} approach has been applied: rational drug design uses the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme's active site to predict which molecules might be inhibitors. These predictions are then tested and one of these tested compounds may be a novel inhibitor. This new inhibitor is then {{used to try to}} obtain a structure of the enzyme in an inhibitor/enzyme complex to show how the molecule is binding to the active site, allowing changes to be made to the inhibitor to try to optimise binding. This test and improve cycle is then repeated until a sufficiently potent inhibitor is produced. <b>Computer-based</b> methods of predicting the affinity of an inhibitor for an enzyme are also being developed, such as molecular docking and molecular mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Once a human-only {{endeavor}} based mainly upon {{changes in}} barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition, weather forecasting now relies on <b>computer-based</b> models that take many atmospheric factors into account. Human input is still required {{to pick the}} best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The inaccuracy of forecasting {{is due to the}} chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, the error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes. Hence, forecasts become less accurate as the difference between current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the range of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.|$|E
5|$|The Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular {{method to}} measure {{implicit}} self-esteem, surpassed {{only by the}} Implicit Association Test. The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task. There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all {{the letters of the}} alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much you like the letters or how attractive you find them), in the rating scales (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), in the order of the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or <b>computer-based).</b>|$|E
5|$|The Nimrod {{was created}} {{only four years}} after the 1947 {{invention}} of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, and one year after a similar purpose built game-playing machine, Bertie the Brain, the first <b>computer-based</b> game to feature a visual display of any sort. The Nimrod is considered under some definitions one of the first video games, possibly the second. While definitions vary, the prior cathode-ray tube amusement device was a purely analog electrical game, and while the Nimrod and Bertie did not feature an electronic screen they both had a game running on a computer. The software-based tic-tac-toe game OXO and a draughts program by Christopher Strachey were programmed a year later in 1952 and were the first computer games to display visuals on an electronic screen rather than through light bulbs.|$|E
5|$|The {{engineering}} and prototyping for Asteroid {{was done by}} Alcorn. The game is encoded entirely in discrete electronic components, like Atari's earlier games, and unlike later <b>computer-based</b> arcade games; the graphics are all simple line elements {{with the exception of}} the spacecraft, which are generated based on diodes on the circuit board arranged in the shape of half of a ship to represent the shape they create. That half ship is mirrored on the screen, similar to the diode array in Computer Space, which generated eight directions of a rotating ship with a mirrored four images. The game was completed quickly, and Alcorn soon moved on to Atari's third game, Gotcha. When the game was complete, the design was given to Midway to sell under that name, only for Atari to produce a nearly identical version itself titled Space Race, which was released on July 16, 1973.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{games of}} the Commander Keen series were developed by id Software, but after {{the success of their}} 3D first-person shooters such as Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and Doom (1993), they cancelled the planned future episodes in the series. In 1999, founder John Carmack remarked that he was considering making a Game Boy Color game for the series, and sometime afterwards id approached Activision with the idea. Activision recommended David A. Palmer Productions to develop the game, as they had been proposing to make Game Boy Color versions of id's other games, and Palmer proceeded to make the game with oversight from id. The game was announced in April 2001 and released soon after. It received mixed reviews from critics, who gave varied opinions {{on the quality of the}} game's graphics and the suitability of the ten-year-old <b>computer-based</b> gameplay on a modern handheld game console, and generally found the game best suited for fans of the original series or younger players.|$|E
5|$|The {{very first}} {{computer}} games {{began to appear}} in the 1950s, starting with Bertie the Brain, a <b>computer-based</b> game of tic-tac-toe built by Dr. Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. While the status of these games as video games depends on the definition used, the games developed during this time period ran on the large antecedents of mainframe computers and were primarily developed for the purposes of academic research or to showcase the technological development of the computers on which they ran. Access to these computers, located almost exclusively in universities and research institutions, was restricted to academics and researchers, preventing any development of entertainment programs. Over the course of the decade, computer technology improved to include smaller, transistor-based computers on which programs could be created and run in real time, rather than operations run in batches, and computers themselves spread to more locations.|$|E
5|$|Twelve C-130Js are {{operated}} by No.37 Squadron, also based at Richmond under No.84 Wing. The aircraft are generally crewed by two pilots and a loadmaster, and are tasked with medium tactical airlift in Australia and overseas, transporting troops and cargo, and conducting medical evacuation, search-and-rescue, and airdrop missions. No.285 Squadron manages the full-flight mission simulator (FFMS) used to convert aircrew to the C-130J, {{as well as}} decommissioned Hercules airframes used for loadmaster training. It also employs <b>computer-based</b> training tools and is allocated flying aircraft from No.37 Squadron when required. As well as training aircrew new to the C-130J, the FFMS (maintained by CAE Australia) is employed for existing aircrew to maintain their currency.|$|E
25|$|On July 18, 2005, the AAMC {{announced}} that it would offer the paper-and-pencil version of the MCAT only through August 2006. A subset of testing sites offered a <b>computer-based</b> version of the full-length exam throughout 2005 and 2006. A shorter, <b>computer-based</b> version of the test debuted in January 2007.
