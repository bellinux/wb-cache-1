2500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{incident}}, Burroughs claimed the [...] "William Tell" [...] incident never happened, {{and that he}} had dropped his gun and it had accidentally fired. Burroughs spent 13 days in jail before his brother came to Mexico City and bribed Mexican lawyers and officials to release Burroughs on bail while he awaited trial for the killing, which was ruled culpable homicide. Vollmer's daughter, Julie Adams, went to live with her grandmother, and William S. Burroughs Jr. went to St. Louis to live with his grandparents.

He was convicted in absentia of homicide and was given a two-year suspended sentence.|$|E
