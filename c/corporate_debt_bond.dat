40|$|This 2002 Article IV Consultation {{highlights}} {{that the}} economic growth of Korea rose to about 6 percent in 2002 from 3 percent in 2001. Buoyant consumption and residential construction spending underpinned the recovery beginning in late 2001. In 2002, exports rebounded strongly {{in spite of a}} weaker-than-expected recovery in the global economy. Unemployment has eased to near pre-crisis levels, although wage rises have been matched by productivity growth. In terms of macroeconomic policies, the fiscal surplus was substantially higher than budgeted, resulting in a contractionary fiscal stance in 2002.

40|$|With {{corporate}} bond issuance having grown {{at a fast}} pace in Austria in recent years, bonds have become firmly established as a pillar of the financing structure of the domestic corporate sector. More and more issuers are smaller firms, and they come from {{a broad range of}} industries. Bond financing allows companies to diversify their financing sources and to broaden their creditor base beyond the banking industry. Rather than drive up <b>corporate</b> <b>debt,</b> <b>bonds</b> have become an alternative to bank loans as a borrowing instrument. Compared with loans, bonds allow companies to borrow money over longer horizons, but high upfront costs make this instrument more attractive for companies that need to finance large volumes. Moreover, bonds are not equally appropriate for all financing requirements, which is why they will never fully replace loans in the long term. Finally, more stringent requirements implicitly apply to the quality of a company's credit ratings when companies intend to issue bonds than when they apply for a bank loan. So far, there have been very few cases of bond defaults in Austria. Corporate bonds...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe examine optimal {{supply of}} safe {{government}} bonds accounting for {{their effect on}} <b>corporate</b> <b>debt</b> markets. Government <b>bonds</b> are shown to influence leverage under asymmetric information regarding corporate cash flows and safe asset scarcity. Corporations have incentives to issue junk debt in response to safe asset scarcity since uninformed investors then migrate to junk debt markets. Uninformed demand stimulates informed speculation which drives junk debt prices closer to fundamentals, encouraging pooling at high leverage. Acting as borrower of first resort, the government can issue safe bonds which siphon off uninformed demand for risky <b>corporate</b> <b>debt</b> and reduce socially wasteful informed speculation. Thus, government bonds either eliminate pooling at high leverage or improve risk sharing in such equilibria.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{restructuring}} of sovereign bonds with and without collective action clauses. One conclusion is that collective action clauses can allow efficient debt renegotiation in a formal model of sovereign debt renegotiation while unanimity rules offer incentives for opportunistic behavior by bondholders that leads to inefficient outcomes. With collective action clauses, the mutual gains from renegotiation can be internalized by bondholders so that the holders of each bond issue have incentives {{to participate in a}} collective debt restructuring. The analysis abstracts from transactions costs, and the last conclusion might well be sensitive to renegotiation and coordination costs.

From the experiences of 39 petroleum firms during the period 1976 - 2005, we found R&D investment has a positive effect on the use of common equity, a U-shaped effect on the use of convertible securities, and an inverted U-shaped effect on the use of relational debt to raise capital.

Contrary to earlier results, {{we find that}} international diversification among government bonds does not yield significant diversification benefits. This result is obtained using mean-variance spanning and intersection tests, with restrictions for short sales, both for currency unhedged and hedged internationally developed market government bonds. Currency hedged international corporate bonds in turn do offer some diversification benefits, and emerging market debt, in particular, significantly shifts the mean-variance frontier for a developed market investor. Since especially unconstrained mean-variance spanning and intersection tests can indicate significant diversification benefits, but lead to frontier portfolios with extreme weights, we also consider some ex-ante global government bond portfolio strategies. We find that passive global benchmarks such as GDP-weighed government bond portfolios perform quite well within developed countries. international bond diversification, mean-variance spanning and intersection, emerging market <b>debt,</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>bond,...</b>|$|R
