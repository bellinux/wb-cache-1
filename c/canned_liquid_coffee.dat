50|$|In Japan, iced coffee (aisu kōhī) {{has been}} drunk since Taishō period (around the 1920s) in coffeehouses. It is served with gum syrup and milk. Cold tea was already popular, {{so it was}} natural to drink cold coffee. Cold brew coffee is also common in Japan, where it is known as Dutch coffee (dacchi kōhii), due to the {{historical}} Dutch coffee trade from Indonesia. In 1969, UCC Ueshima Coffee released canned coffee, which made coffee available everywhere. Today, <b>canned</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>coffee</b> is consumed both cold and hot.|$|E
50|$|A {{coffee filter}} is a coffee-brewing utensil, usually made of {{disposable}} paper. This enables it to trap the coffee grounds {{and allow the}} <b>liquid</b> <b>coffee</b> to flow through.|$|R
50|$|Wawa {{periodically}} introduces new {{items to}} its menu, {{such as the}} now-discontinued ciabatta, a sandwich on a distinctive roll, and the breakfast hoagie. It sells seasonal coffee flavors like pumpkin spice in the fall, and a mint-flavored coffee around December. Wawa began selling bagged coffee in the millennium decade due to the popularity of its <b>liquid</b> <b>coffee</b> sold in-store.|$|R
25|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>coffee</b> {{concentrates}} {{are sometimes}} used in large institutional situations where coffee {{needs to be}} produced for thousands {{of people at the}} same time. It is described as having a flavor about as good as low-grade robusta coffee, and costs about 10¢ a cup to produce. The machines can process up to 500 cups an hour, or 1,000 if the water is preheated.|$|R
5000|$|The coffee {{vending machine}} is a vending machine that {{dispenses}} hot coffee and other coffee beverages. Older models used instant <b>coffee</b> or concentrated <b>liquid</b> <b>coffee</b> and hot or boiling water, and provided condiments such as cream and sugar. Some modern machines prepare various coffee styles such as mochas and lattes and use ground drip coffee, and some fresh-grind the coffee to order using a grinder in the machine.|$|R
50|$|Coffee {{preparation}} {{is the process}} of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While the particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic steps: raw coffee beans must be roasted, the roasted coffee beans must then be ground, the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot water for a certain time (brewed), and finally the <b>liquid</b> <b>coffee</b> must be separated from the used grounds.|$|R
50|$|On February 9, 2012 about 835,000 coffee makers were {{recalled}} in the United States and another 900,000 in Canada after {{reports of the}} brewers spraying hot <b>liquid,</b> <b>coffee</b> grounds or tea leaves onto people. Reports from the Consumer Product Safety Commission say {{that there have been}} 140 reports on the maker, 37 of those cases involve second degree burns. The Commission has also recalled 4 million T-Discs over reports that they can burst while brewing.|$|R
50|$|Additional {{companies}} that manufactured coffee vending machines in 1947 in the United States include the Manning & Lewis company, Knapway Devices and the Bert Mills Corporation. Some machines in 1947 used a <b>liquid</b> <b>coffee</b> concentrate that was mixed with boiling water, and one such machine charged a nickel {{for a cup}} of coffee and dispensed a wooden spoon to mix the cream and sugar. By the year 1955, over 60,000 coffee vending machines existed in the United States.|$|R

50|$|Ponche crema is a Venezuelan and Trinidadian cream-based liqueur. Recipes vary {{depending}} on the region, but main ingredients typically include milk, eggs, sugar, rum, and other minor ingredients such as vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, and lemon rind. A variant type is prepared with concentrated <b>liquid</b> <b>coffee</b> or instant coffee powder. However, most references to the ponche crema name aim at a traditional commercial product, available since 1900, whose recipe and manufacturing process are kept secret. Ponche crema is a beverage traditionally served in Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago during Christmas time, much as eggnog is in the United States. It is usually served cold, in small cups, either as an aperitif or a pousse-café.|$|R

50|$|In 1972, Holland Milk Products, Inc. (HOMPI) was established. It was a {{joint venture}} between AMC’s former parent company, General Milling Corporation (GMC), and Holland Canned Milk International B.V. (now FrieslandCampina). HOMPI {{initially}} manufactured <b>canned</b> <b>liquid</b> milk (evaporated milk and condensed milk). It eventually expanded to manufacture powdered milk and UHT milk.|$|R
50|$|In December 2014, French chef, Joël Roessel, {{discovered}} that water from canned beans and other vegetables {{can be made}} to form foams much like protein isolates and flax mucilage. Roessel shared his experiments anonymously on a blog in France showing that the <b>canning</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>can</b> be used as a foaming agent. He also published recipes for floating island of Chaville, chocolate mousse, and he made a meringue made from chickpea liquid, sugar, corn starch and guar gum to demonstrate its foaming capabilities.|$|R

50|$|The {{combination}} of all these effects means that mixtures of salts, including perchlorates in the mixture, <b>can</b> be <b>liquid</b> at lower temperatures {{than any of the}} salts separately, and also take up water from the atmosphere at lower relative humidity, and once <b>liquid,</b> <b>can</b> remain <b>liquid</b> for longer than you would predict if you didn't take account of these effects. And if there are micropores in the salt deposits, any life within them could also take advantage of an internal relative humidity higher than the external humidity of the atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|The company's {{first product}} was the Clover 1s, {{a machine that}} {{produces}} brewed coffee one cup at a time. The machine uses a brewing method {{similar to that of}} a French press along with a vacuum system to separate the <b>liquid</b> from the <b>coffee</b> grounds.|$|R
40|$|Waste is inevitable. Things {{which have}} been outgrown, broken, replaced, or are just no longer needed add to the waste {{produced}} at homes, acreages and around farms. Most of the waste accumulated around the farm, acreage and home is solid waste. Solid waste includes all discarded materials — newspapers, empty paint <b>cans,</b> <b>liquids,</b> gases, pickle jars, orange peelings, leftover food, worn out shoes, junk mail — this list is endless. Some of these solid wastes contain potentially hazardous materials...|$|R
50|$|Water and saliva enter {{through the}} rumen {{to form a}} liquid pool. Liquid will {{ultimately}} escape from the reticulorumen from absorption through the wall, or through passing through the reticulo-omosal orifice, as digesta does. However, since liquid cannot be trapped in the mat as digesta <b>can,</b> <b>liquid</b> passes through the rumen {{much more quickly than}} digesta does. Liquid often acts as a carrier for very small digesta particles, such that the dynamics of small particles {{is similar to that of}} liquid.|$|R

40|$|Two {{different}} ways of preprocessing chemical sensor data are presented {{as a means to}} improve the interpretation and the classification ability of an electronic nose (EN). The practical problem at hand is the distinction between four commercial coffee blends - containing up to 12 types of coffees - all of which are to be consumed as Espresso. Coffee was sampled in three successive preparation phases: as beans, ground (powder) or liquid (the actual Espresso). In the case of beans, stress is put on the improved clusters visualization after the preprocessing and before the actual classification is performed. Different catalysed sensors and successive extractions were used to differentiate the response pattern towards the various coffees. The features which permitted the best samples' classification as judged from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) score plots were selected. To this end, an empirical search strategy inside the feature space is presented. Scores from PCA were subsequently utilized as inputs for a feed forward multilayer perceptron (MLP) with cross-validation resulting in 100 % correct classification with just two sensors. In the case of ground coffee, a (supervised) drift compensation algorithm was developed. It essentially consists of removing the first principal component (PC) for every cluster since this is seen to be given by the drift. An 87. 5 % classification performance was achieved. <b>Liquid</b> <b>coffee,</b> on the other hand, was not successfully classified, probably due to the difficulty in assuring reproducible sampling conditions.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} solid particles on the heating of canned foods. A numerical model for natural convection heating of liquids developed by Datta and Teixeira in 1987 was used for predicting the values of temperature and velocity inside a <b>can</b> filled with <b>liquid</b> and grain. The solid particles influence the buoyancy that drives the flow during the heating of the can, and this problem has not been solved until now. As a first attempt to solve it, we assumed a radical simplification and treated {{the system composed of}} liquid and particles as a porous medium. FIDAP (Fluid Dynamics Analysis Package) was the finite-element-based software used for simulating the fluid and heat flow. The plots of distribution of temperature and velocity in the cans showed that the qualitative behavior of both <b>cans</b> (<b>liquid</b> and liquid+grain system) was the same: the liquid near the hot wall becomes lighter and rises, there is radial flow near the top and uniform flow near the centerline. In conclusion, we observed that the solid matrix reduces the magnitude of the velocities by approximately 10 % and slows down the distribution of temperature in the <b>can</b> filled with <b>liquid</b> and grain...|$|R
