[...] On a strict and literal interpretation, I doubt if claims lie against Germany for damage done,--e.g. by the Turks to the Suez Canal, or by Austrian submarines in the Adriatic.

40|$|How {{should the}} <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> of a {{sovereign}} {{be treated in}} a general restructuring of the debts of that sovereign? This question has played only a minor role in past sovereign debt restructurings because the size of such <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> has in most cases been small. In recent years, however, slathering government guarantees on third party debt has become the tool of choice for many countries {{in their efforts to}} quell an incipient panic in their financial markets. Some of those sovereigns are now, or may soon be, in the position of needing to restructure their debts. Ignoring large <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> in a sovereign debt restructuring may plant a land mine on the road to debt sustainability once the restructuring closes. That said, the answers to the questions of whether and how to restructure <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> are not obvious. Is the restructurer to assume that some, all or none of those <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> will eventually wind up as direct claims against the sovereign? Even if the underlying instrument can be successfully restructured, the guarantee will typically stand as an independent obligation of the guarantor that will require separate treatment in the restructuring...|$|R

40|$|To {{control the}} {{expansion}} of government <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> and reduce fiscal vulnerability, one {{must be able to}} identify and measure them. The authors discuss how this may be done and demonstrate how the assessment of fiscal adjustment may change substantially when a broader picture of government liabilities is included. They base their analysis on experience in analyzing fiscal adjustment in the Czech Republic and Macedonia. Their work demonstrates the importance of including <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> when analyzing fiscal sustainability. To the extent that explicit expenditures are shifted off-budget or replaced by guarantees, the achieved improvement in fiscal balances is overstated. For the Czech Republic, adjustment may have been overstated by some 3 to 4 percent of annual GDP. A stabilization program accompanied by a build-up of <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities,</b> particularly state guarantees and obligations to cover liabilities emerging from directed credit, may not be sustainable. In Macedonia, the present fiscal equilibrium may be temporary because the stock of existing <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> could add 2 to 4 percent of GDP to future deficits. And methods used to reduce the"traditional"deficit are unlikely to be sustainable without further modification. The authors conclude that governments: 1) must find better ways to identify and evaluate <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> arising from the banking system, nonbanking financial institutions, public enterprises, or the <b>contingent</b> and direct <b>liabilities</b> of subnational governments; 2) need to better manage their risks [...] for example, building adequate reserve funds and hedging risk, where possible; and 3) should examine the implications of the bias toward adding <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> and develop administrative reform as part of analyzing budget management.

50|$|Whilst the {{standard}} on provisions, IAS 37, prohibits {{the recognition of}} a provision for contingent liabilities, this prohibition is not applicable to the accounting for contingent liabilities in a business combination.

50|$|In {{the less}} common {{unassigned}} case, the defendant or property/casualty insurer retains the periodic payment obligation and funds it by purchasing an annuity {{from a life}} insurance company, thereby offsetting its obligation with a matching asset. The payment stream purchased under the annuity matches exactly, in timing and amounts, the periodic payments agreed to in the settlement agreement. The defendant or property/casualty company owns the annuity and names the claimant as the payee under the annuity, thereby directing the annuity issuer to send payments directly to the claimant. One of the reasons an unassigned case is less popular is that the obligation is not truly off the books, and the defendant or casualty insurer retains a <b>contingent</b> <b>liability.</b> While a default is a rare occurrence, <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> did come into play with the liquidation of Executive Life Insurance Company of New York. Some annuitants suffered shortfalls, {{and a number of}} obligors at the wrong end of unassigned cases made up the difference.|$|E
40|$|The <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> of a sovereign, such as {{guarantees}} of the debts of third parties, can normally be kept off {{the balance sheet}} of the sovereign guarantor. That is their charm. As the debt to GDP ratios of many developed countries approach red-zone levels, <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> are increasingly being favored over direct, on-the-balance-sheet, borrowings. But what happens if a country carrying large <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> needs to restructure its debt? The borrower dare not leave its contingent claims out of the restructuring. To do so would risk undermining the financial predicates of the sovereign’s economic recovery program should the beneficiaries of the guarantees demand payment in full after the restructuring closes. Attempting to shoehorn sovereign <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> into a debt restructuring, however, is a particularly challenging task. There are few precedents for how to do so, and no good precedents. The explosion {{in the size of}} contingent sovereign obligations since the financial crisis began in 2008 inevitably means that these issues will need to be confronted sooner or later, probably sooner...|$|R

5000|$|The {{term was}} coined by U.S. Treasury {{officials}} {{to describe a}} variety of tax shelters that sought to wipe out taxes on capital gains {{from the sale of}} a business or other appreciated asset; for example, by artificially inflating the basis of a partnership by contributing an asset paired with a <b>contingent</b> <b>liability.</b> The partnership contribution rules at the time ignored the <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> that effectively offset the asset. The result was an inflated basis that allowed the taxpayer to claim a loss from the partnership's subsequent unwinding. The shelters involved creating paper losses to offset real gains. All resembled an earlier shelter marketed as [...] "BOSS," [...] short for [...] "Bond and Option Sales Strategy." [...] Beginning in the late 1990s, advisers at some accounting and law firms marketed the Son of BOSS transaction in various forms.
