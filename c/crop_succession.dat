In this study, the SURFEX/ISBAA- gs simulations of evapotranspiration are assessed at local scale over a 12 year 5 Mediterranean <b>crop</b> <b>succession.</b> The model is evaluated in its standard implementation which relies on the use of the ISBA pedotransfer estimates of the soil properties. The originality of this work consists in explicitly representing the succession of crop cycles and inter-crop bare soil periods in the simulations and assessing its impact on the dynamic of simulated and measured evapotranspiration over a long period of time. 10 The analysis focuses on key soil parameters which drive the simulation of evapotranspiration, namely the rooting depth, the soil moisture at saturation, the soil moisture at field capacity and the soil moisture at wilting point. The simulations achieved with the standard values of these parameters are compared to those achieved with the in situ values. The portability of the ISBA pedotransfer functions is evaluated over a typical 15 Mediterranean crop site. Various in situ estimates of the soil parameters are considered and distinct parametrization strategies are tested to represent the evapotranspiration dynamic over the <b>crop</b> <b>succession.</b> This work shows that evapotranspiration mainly results from the soil evaporation when it is continuously simulated over a Mediterranean <b>crop</b> <b>succession.</b> The evapo 20 transpiration simulated with the standard surface and soil parameters of the model is largely underestimated. The deficit in cumulative evapotranspiration amounts to 24 % over 12 years. The bias in daily daytime evapotranspiration is − 0. 24 mmday− 1. The ISBA pedotransfer estimates of the soil moisture at saturation and at wilting point are overestimated which explains most of the evapotranspiration underestimation. The 25 overestimation of the soil moisture at wilting point causes the underestimation of transpiration at the end of the crop cycles. The overestimation of the soil moisture at saturation triggers the underestimation of the soil evaporation during the wet soil periods. The use of field capacity values derived from laboratory retention measurements leads to inaccurate simulation of soil evaporation due to the lack of representativeness of the soil structure variability at the field scale. The most accurate simulation is achieved with the values of the soil hydraulic properties derived from field measured soil moisture. Their temporal analysis over each crop cycle provides meaningful estimates of the 5 wilting point, the field capacity and the rooting depth to represent the crop water needs and accurately simulate the evapotranspiration over the <b>crop</b> <b>succession.</b> We showed that the uncertainties in the eddy-covariance measurements are significant and can explain a large part of the unresolved random differences between the simulations and the measurements of evapotranspiration.

The originality of this work consists in explicitly representing the succession of crop cycles and inter-crop bare soil periods in the simulations and assessing its impact on the dynamics of simulated and measured evapotranspiration over a long period of time. The analysis focuses on key parameters which drive the simulation of ET, namely the rooting depth, the soil moisture at saturation, the soil moisture at field capacity and the soil moisture at wilting point. A sensitivity analysis is first conducted to quantify the relative contribution of each parameter on ET simulation over 12 years. The impact of the estimation method used to retrieve the soil parameters (pedotransfer function, laboratory and field methods) on ET is then analysed. The benefit of representing the variations in time of the rooting depth and wilting point is evaluated. Finally, the propagation of uncertainties in the soil parameters on ET simulations is quantified through a Monte Carlo analysis and compared with the uncertainties triggered by the mesophyll conductance which is a key above-ground driver of the stomatal conductance. This work shows that evapotranspiration mainly results from the soil evaporation when it is continuously simulated over a Mediterranean <b>crop</b> <b>succession.</b> This results in a high sensitivity of simulated evapotranspiration to uncertainties in the soil moisture at field capacity and the soil moisture at saturation, both of which drive the simulation of soil evaporation. Field capacity was proved to be the most influencing parameter on the simulation of evapotranspiration over the <b>crop</b> <b>succession.</b> The evapotranspiration simulated with the standard surface and soil parameters of the model is largely underestimated.

The use of field capacity values retrieved from laboratory methods leads to inaccurate simulation of ET due to the lack of representativeness of the soil structure variability at the field scale. The most accurate simulation is achieved with the average values of the soil properties derived from the analysis of field measurements of soil moisture vertical profiles over each crop cycle. The representation of the variations in time of the wilting point and the maximum rooting depth over the <b>crop</b> <b>succession</b> has little impact on the simulation performances. Finally, we show that the uncertainties in the soil parameters can generate substantial uncertainties in ET simulated over 12 years (the 95 % confidence interval represents 23 % of cumulative ET over 12 years).

The deficits in simulated ET reported in this work are probably larger due to likely underestimation of ET by eddy-covariance measurements.

Weeds are mostly annual plants that rely exclusively on seeds for perpetuation, the latter presenting various level of longevity and dispersal capacity according to the species. In farmland, arable fields surrounded by landscape with high proportion of grasslands harbor high level of weed diversity revealing important dispersal flux. Similarly, the presence of grasslands in the past history (i. e <b>crop</b> <b>succession)</b> of the field promotes actual weed community diversity thanks to temporal dispersion through the seed bank. Therefore, grasslands favor weed diversity both by being present in the surrounding landscape and in the <b>crop</b> <b>succession.</b> However whether the effect of grasslands is higher in space or time remains unknown mainly because their presence {{in space and time}} are generally correlated.

The ICL system proposes a diversity of activities that include the strategic incorporation of pastures to agriculture so as to benefit both.

For comparison purposes, areas under native vegetation, pastures, <b>crop</b> <b>succession</b> and ID. under different edapho-climatic conditions in Amazonia and Cerrado biomes were evaluated. This study demonstrated that the conversion of native vegetation to pasture can cause the soil to function either as a source or a sink of atmospheric CO 2, depending on the land management applied. Non-degraded pasture under fertile soil showed a mean accumulation rate of 0. 46 g ha(- 1) year(- 1). Carbon losses from pastures implemented in naturally low fertile soil ranged from 0. 15 to 1. 53 Mg ha(- 1) year(- 1), respectively, for non-degraded and degraded pasture. The conversion of native vegetation to agriculture in areas under the ICL system, even when cultivated under NT, resulted in C losses of 1. 31 in six years and of 0. 69 Mg ha(- 1) in 21 years. The conversion of a non-degraded pasture to cropland (soybean/sorghum) released, in average, 1. 44 Mg of C ha(- 1) year(- 1) to the atmosphere. The ICL system in agricultural areas has shown evidences that it always functions as a sink of C with accumulation rates ranging from 0. 82 to 2. 58 Mg ha(- 1) year(- 1).

Rotation plans must respect ecologically-based constraints such as the interdiction of certain <b>crop</b> <b>successions,</b> and the regular insertion of fallows and green manures. We propose a linear formulation for this problem, in which each variable is associated with a crop rotation schedule. The model may include a large number of variables and it is, therefore, solved by means of a column-generation approach. We also discuss some extensions to the model, in order to incorporate additional characteristics found in field conditions. A set of computational tests using instances based on real-world data confirms the efficacy of the proposed methodology. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The landscapes {{currently}} {{studied in}} ecology are either “discontinuous ” (category-based or patchbased), {{as in the}} case of mosaics of agricultural units, or of more “continuous ” type (raster lattices), as used for representing elevation or other ecological gradients. The main landscape models either involve explicit processes or are neutral, recreating spatial patterns in the absence of studied processes (using statistical rules). This article presents neutral models suitable for the creation and handling of patchy landscapes. These models (Patchy Landscape Neutral Models) adapt the Gibbs process already used successfully in forestry and biology to describe the local interactions between landscape units. These interactions can be either ecological, if justified for example by natural mechanisms of dispersal (plant species dynamics) or <b>crop</b> <b>successions</b> in anthropized landscapes, or statistical (geometrical). We define a global &quot;cost function &quot; representative of the landscape to be simulated by summing the &quot;pair function &quot; that expresses the interactions between units for the whole landscape. This generic approach makes it possible to reconstruct different kinds of patchy landscape compositions (land cover) and opens the way to studying changes in landscape configuration (unit arrangements) as well as an analytical description of landscapes.

40|$|Agriculture is {{the result}} of a balance between soil, climate, plants and {{cropping}} techniques applied by the farmers. Once one of those elements, in this case the climate, is perceptibly modified in a sustainable way, it is important that the other elements are also modified to respect the balance. To adapt to climate change farmers can modify their strategic or tactic decisions. But the very first point is to have good ideas of what are to be expected in terms of climate modifications and their agronomic consequences: acceleration of crop cycles, increase of summer droughts and increase in inter-season and inter-annual variability. Concerning strategic choices, one must not expect revolution and climate change will not deeply modify cropping systems. Yet rainfed crops will be more difficult in the south while summer <b>crops</b> and <b>crop</b> <b>successions</b> will become easier in the north. Escape strategies in terms of crop and genotype choices could be advantageous. An important point of discussion is about sowing dates. If they could theoretically be advanced for summer crops, the soil water status may not be adequate for allowing farmers to enter fields with heavy machines. It is also because of soil dryness that winter crops sowing should be delayed. In order to provide the farmers with more quantified results an ANR project, CLIMATOR, is proceeding...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Wheat {{and corn}} are {{important}} grains {{in the agricultural}} scenario of Brazil, and demand adequate supply of nutrients, particularly nitrogen, in <b>crop</b> <b>succession.</b> The use of pig slurry (PS) as a full and/or partial alternative to mineral fertilization in crop areas {{has been identified as}} an important alternative for the disposal of this waste. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the utilization of PS as fertilizer in wheat/corn succession under some plant parameters and grain yield. The experiment was conducted under field in randomized block design with four replications and five treatments, three with PS (40, 80, 160 m³ ha- 1) and two controls (no fertilization and mineral NPK fertilization), which were applied manually in the soil shortly after sowing the crops. The application of PS proved to be a significant source of nutrients in wheat/corn succession. In comparison to NPK fertilization, this increase was only of 5. 4 % and 4. 7 % for wheat and corn, respectively. PS is an efficient alternative and it can be used as a source of these nutrients in wheat/corn succession, and the use of 80 m 3 ha- 1 provides satisfactory results for all evaluated variables...|$|E
40|$|For agronomic, environmental, and {{economic}} reasons, {{the need for}} spatialized information about agricultural practices is expected to rapidly increase. In this context, we reviewed the literature on remote sensing for mapping cropping practices. The reviewed studies were grouped into three categories of practices: <b>crop</b> <b>succession</b> (crop rotation and fallowing), cropping pattern (single tree crop planting pattern, sequential cropping, and intercropping/agroforestry), and cropping techniques (irrigation, soil tillage, harvest and post-harvest practices, crop varieties, and agro-ecological infrastructures). We observed {{that the majority of}} the studies were exploratory investigations, tested on a local scale with a high dependence on ground data, and used only one type of remote sensing sensor. Furthermore, to be correctly implemented, most of the methods relied heavily on local knowledge on the management practices, the environment, and the biological material. These limitations point to future research directions, such as the use of land stratification, multi-sensor data combination, and expert knowledge-driven methods. Finally, the new spatial technologies, and particularly the Sentinel constellation, are expected to improve the monitoring of cropping practices in the challenging context of food security and better management of agro-environmental issues...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} soybean-maize <b>crop</b> <b>succession</b> in {{the tropical}} region of Brazil has led to significant increases in the population size of root-knot (Meloidogyne incognita and M. javanica) and root-lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus brachyurus), which make soils unsuitable for soybean cropping. A greenhouse {{study was conducted to}} identify sunflower genotypes adapted to the tropical region of Brazil and that are resistant to M. incognita, M. javanica and/or P. brachyurus. Two experiments for each nematode were conducted in a completely randomized design with six replicates. Gall index was calculated from visual scores (0 ? 5) of gall intensity on roots for the root-knot nematode. Initial and final population density and reproduction factor were also measured for each nematode. Sunflower genotypes varied in resistance to the nematodes. Sunflower hybrids BRS 321 and BRS 323 were resistant to M. javanica and P. brachyurus and exhibited low gall index for M. incognita. The cultivars are good alternatives to using in the succession of soybean in nematode-infested areas of the tropical regions of Brazil. No sunflower genotype was identified as resistant to M. incognita and thus sunflower cropping is not indicated in areas infested with this nematode. 201...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of agroecological transition, the {{reintroduction}} of legume crops should {{play a key role}} in cropping system sustainability by allowing a reduction of nitrogen (N) inputs. But few references are available concerning the agronomical and ecological services provided by a wide range of legume crops, particularly within <b>crops</b> <b>succession</b> scale. Thus, the main objective of our study is to quantify the N fluxes during and after the legume crops taking into account 10 legume crops (peas, lupin, faba bean, soybean [...] .). Our experiment consists in i) quantifying symbiotic N fixation depending on the amount of soil inorganic N, the mineralisation of N present in legume crop residues after soil incorporation and N losses outside of the soil-plant system (leaching, emission of nitrous oxide), ii) identifying plant biological traits associated to N fluxes. Thus, different N fluxes were quantified during a two-year field experiment, i. e. the first year (2014) legume crops were implanted and followed by wheat the second year (14 - 15) after incorportation of legume residues. This experiment will be repeated in 2016 - 2017. The first results concerning legume pre-crop effects will be presented during the congress, considering the effect of preceding legume crops on wheat seed yield and N content. This effect will be related to legume aerial and below ground residues that were characterized by their biomass, C/N content and potential mineralization...|$|R

40|$|The quick {{dynamics}} of the vegetable production sector, characterized by rapid <b>cropping</b> <b>successions</b> and species with very different cultural needs, usually results in intensive soil tillage and management. These processes are necessary to ensure the best conditions for the crop and adequate development throughout the crop cycle from sowing, or transplanting, to harvest. Different types of soil tillage are often used {{in the creation of}} raised seed- or transplant beds. The reported experiment was aimed at evaluating the effect of raised beds, in comparison to traditional soil management, on the morpho-dimensional traits of different vegetable species. Seven vegetable crops were considered: lettuce, zucchini, green beans, rocket salad, variegated-leaved Italian chicory, long-stemmed Italian chicory and chard, transplanted and seeded in raised beds and on flat soil. At marketable size the crops were harvested and sampled in order to evaluate morphological and dimensional characteristics specific for each crop including the root system. Results showed the positive effect of raised beds, especially for transplanted crops (lettuce and zucchini), which increased yield by more than 15 % in the first case. Direct sown crops were more variable. Positive results for raised bed were recorded for rocket salad, with a weight gain of the aerial part higher than 50 %; whereas green bean did not respond significantly to soil tillage. The tillage effect was also significant on root system dimensions that, in the case of beds, was generally higher compared to the flat soil...|$|R
