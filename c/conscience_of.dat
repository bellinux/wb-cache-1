5|$|Martin Luther King Jr. was the <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> his generation. He gazed {{upon the}} great wall of {{segregation}} and saw that the power of love could bring it down. From the pain and exhaustion of his fight to fulfill the promises of our founding fathers for our humblest citizens, he wrung his eloquent statement of his dream for America. He made our nation stronger because he made it better. His dream sustains us yet.|$|E
5|$|Rodham's {{mother wanted}} her to have an independent, {{professional}} career, and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender. Raised in a politically conservative household, Rodham helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon. She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964. Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The <b>Conscience</b> <b>of</b> a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.|$|E

5|$|Despite the denunciations {{from the}} anarchist {{organizations}} and periodicals around the world, opinion {{began to change}} in 1976, when Sam Dolgoff published his book The Cuban Revolution: A Critical Perspective. As well, in 1979, the MLCE began publishing a new magazine titled Guángara Libertaria, reprinting Alfredo Gómez' article The Cuban Anarchists, or the Bad <b>Conscience</b> <b>of</b> Anarchism. In 1980, the MLCE and Guángara Libertaria supported the mass evacuation of Cubans from Cuba after many Cuban dissidents occupied the Peruvian embassy in Havana. Many of those who left Cuba at this time joined the editorial collective of Guángara. By 1985, the collective had correspondents around the world, including Mexico, Hawaii, Spain, and Venezuela. The magazine reached a press run of 5000 copies in 1987, making it the largest circulation anarchist periodical in the U.S. However, in 1992, the collective ceased publication of GL, though many of its members continued to publish writings. By 2008, the MLCE was structured as an affinity group and coordinating network for Cuban anarchists of diverse tendencies.|$|E
5|$|Sheppard {{and other}} MCC rebels called a Special General Meeting of the MCC; {{they wanted the}} MCC to state {{publicly}} that the team selection had been mishandled and that no further cricket should take place with South Africa until cricket there had been made non-racial. Before the meeting took place, the General Committee met the rebels and initially claimed {{that it would have}} been inappropriate to ask South Africa about D'Oliveira before the tour—although they had done so. The committee then admitted writing a letter but said that they had never received a reply. The Special General Meeting took place in December 1968, but the rebels were outvoted by the other members; Sheppard was criticised by members at the meeting, and his former friend Peter May refused to talk to him afterwards. Those opposing Sheppard suggested that he opposed apartheid whereas the committee wanted to advance cricket. It was also suggested that the MCC should not act as the <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain. Williams suggests that the vote indicated that a high proportion of the MCC favoured maintaining cricketing links with South Africa despite knowing that South African cricket operated racial segregation.|$|E

40|$|Key words: conscience; health care; {{questionnaire}} Health care {{often involves}} ethically difficult situations that may disquiet the <b>conscience.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> {{this study was}} to develop a questionnaire for identifying various perceptions <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> within a framework based on the literature and on explorative interviews about perceptions <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> (Perceptions <b>of</b> <b>Conscience</b> Questionnaire). The questionnaire was tested on a sample of 444 registered nurses, enrolled nurses, nurses’ assistants and physicians. The data were analysed using principal component analysis to explore possible dimensions <b>of</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>conscience.</b> The results showed six dimensions, found also in theory and empirical health care studies. Conscience was perceived as authority, a warning signal, demanding sensitivity, an asset, a burden and depending on culture. We conclude that the Perceptions <b>of</b> <b>Conscience</b> Questionnaire is valid for assessing some perceptions <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> relevant to health care providers...|$|R

25|$|In 2007, Krugman {{published}} The <b>Conscience</b> <b>of</b> a Liberal, whose title {{refers to}} Barry Goldwater's <b>Conscience</b> <b>of</b> a Conservative. It details {{the history of}} wealth and income gaps in the United States in the 20th century. The book describes how the {{gap between rich and}} poor declined greatly in middle of the century, and then widened in the last two decades to levels higher even than in the 1920s. In Conscience, Krugman argues that government policies played a much greater role than commonly thought both in reducing inequality in the 1930s through 1970s and in increasing it in the 1980s through the present, and criticizes the Bush administration for implementing policies that Krugman believes widened the gap between the rich and poor.|$|E

40|$|Although {{organizational}} and situational {{factors have been}} found to predict burnout, not everyone employed at the same workplace develops it, suggesting that becoming burnt out is a complex, multifaceted phenomenon. The aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate perceptions <b>of</b> <b>conscience,</b> stress <b>of</b> <b>conscience,</b> moral sensitivity, social support and resilience among two groups of health care personnel from the same workplaces, one group on sick leave owing to medically assessed burnout (n 20) and one group who showed no indications of burnout (n 20). The results showed that higher levels <b>of</b> stress <b>of</b> <b>conscience,</b> a perception <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> as a burden, having to deaden one’s conscience in order to keep working in health care and perceiving a lack of support characterized the burnout group. Lower levels <b>of</b> stress <b>of</b> <b>conscience,</b> looking on life with forbearance, a perception <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> as an asset and perceiving support from organizations and those around them (social support) characterized the non-burnout group...|$|R

40|$|Of all {{the freedoms}} {{articulated}} within the Canadian Charter, the least defined {{continues to be}} freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience.</b> Discussions <b>of</b> this freedom within the secondary literature have been relatively superficial, and, to date, no Supreme Court of Canada decision has rested on freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience.</b> This {{is not to say}} that freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> has been entirely ignored. There has been some discussion of it within the case law, and particularly in relation to freedom of religion. This thesis draws upon those cases that reference freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> to construct a clearer image of what the scope and meaning of that freedom might be. In particular, the thesis seeks to define freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> within the context of Canadian law, examine how the courts have operationalized this freedom, and outline the relationship between freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> and freedom <b>of</b> religion. This thesis will also explore the relationships that have been established by the Supreme Court between freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> and the rest of the Charter – particularly freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to life, liberty, and security of the person. These questions are fundamentally important to understanding not only the individual importance <b>of</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> within the Charter, but also to understanding the Charter as a whole...|$|R

25|$|Initially, Italy was the European country most {{interested}} in incorporating Tunisia into its sphere of influence.

From this line of thought naturally develops the concept <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> in those areas of psychology which concern more sensitive topics, focusing on psychology of S. Freud, C. G. Jung, E. Fromm and E. Erikson. A special chapter is devoted to developmental psychology. The final section seeks to highlight the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> in terms <b>of</b> the broader context, taking into account further dimensions in our concept <b>of</b> <b>conscience...</b>|$|R
