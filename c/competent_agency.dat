The increased number of registered general agency nurses working in an acute children's hospital alerted concerns around their competency in working with children.

[Young's (2009) Journal of Organisational Change, 22, 524 - 548] nine-stage change framework was used to guide the implementation of the competency assessment tool within a paediatric acute care setting.

40|$|Migrant {{children}} may display problems {{of participation in}} school interactions with adults and peers, depending on their difficulties in speaking the host country’s language and understanding its culture. This condition amplifies the general view of children as incompetent in producing and acting knowledge. This paper analyses video-recorded interactions in kindergartens in Reggio Emilia (Italy), involving migrant children, teachers and Italian children. These schools are famous worldwide for their methodology, based on treating children as competent agents. I focus on the participants’ actions constructing conversational sequences and on the systems these interactional sequences contribute to construct. The analysis highlights that migrant children are given recognition as competent agents, and that their status and authority is promoted in producing and acting knowledge. Recognition and promotion of migrant children’s agency, status and authority are based on forms of facilitation, coordination and negotiation, enhanced by initiatives taken by teachers and Italian children. These initiatives give particular relevance to: a. migrant children’s personal expressions and display of <b>competent</b> <b>agency,</b> and b. their linguistic and cultural difficulties. Initiatives combining these two aspects promote {{the social construction of}} a form of hybrid identity, both personal and cultural, which is constructed and appraised in the interaction...|$|E
40|$|The {{study area}} was delimited around {{the seat of}} Alegre, Espírito Santo, since this work aims to show through {{multispectral}} imagery, maps and orthophoto the evolution of urban expansion in the area {{as well as its}} relation with Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs). The PPAs are defined by the Brazilian Forest Code {{in order to protect the}} natural environment and also to avoid construction in areas of geological instability.

The use of GIS was effective to promote the delimitation and the calculation of permanent preservation areas, as well as the urban evolution. Through this study, we note that over 25 % of the urban area is in permanent preservation areas and the PPAs occupy more than 13 % of the built up areas.

40|$|Media use of {{hurricane}} graphics to apprise populations vulnerable to severe weather provides a persuasive {{demonstration of the}} importance and complexity of visual communication. Surprisingly little research, however, has explored how audiences interpret weather graphics. This study examined whether {{the general public and}} the National Weather Service share a common understanding of selected weather related terms and meaning of a NWS informational graphic. Using a coorientation model, general public responses to a questionnaire were compared to definitions prescribed by the NWS. Additionally, the public were asked questions to measure trust of the NWS as a credible and reliable source of severe weather information. Selected broadcast meteorologists were surveyed to measure their opinions of the NWS as well as to measure their perceptions of how the general public would respond to questions relating to knowledge of weather terms and graphics. Results revealed discrepancies between the intent of such graphics and audience interpretations. While the vast majority of respondents recognized the Tropical Cyclone Track Watch/Warning Graphic and understood much of the information it conveyed, study respondents did not seem to remember or understand the meaning of the terms Watch and Warning. While these terms or conditions are only one aspect of the graphic they represent critical information for populations at risk. Additionally, {{the results of this study}} indicate that weather forecasting professionals 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the public 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of the graphic are inaccurate.

50|$|In Europe, {{transparency}} of media ownership is infrequently addressed directly in domestic constitutions, {{and even when}} this happens, {{as in the case}} of Italy, Romania or Turkey, constitutional provisions do not impose a specific positive obligation on the state to ensure that citizens have access to information on media ownership. The lack of ad hoc legal provisions on media ownership transparency is partially explained with the fact that often the existing laws have been established with the aim of fulfilling other regulatory objectives, such as providing information to media regulators or for company law purposes. In many European countries, freedom of information legislation provides the basis for requesting information from <b>competent</b> <b>agencies</b> and public bodies.

The {{spatial distribution of}} human and canine cases was analysed by kernel density estimation (KDE) and the K function.

The higher occurrence of human and canine infection occurred in the central area of the city. A positive correlation between the densities of human and canine cases was observed, as well as a negative correlation between NDVI and densities of human and canine cases.
