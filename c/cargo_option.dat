50|$|Design of the Pilot was by Honda's Ricky Hsu through 1999, when styling was approved. The Pilot can {{accommodate}} {{up to eight}} passengers in three rows configured as stadium seating. The third row can seat three, but the limited legroom makes it suitable only for small children or adults on short trips. Similar to the Honda Odyssey, the rear seats can be folded into flat surfaces for larger <b>cargo.</b> <b>Options</b> include powered moonroof, DVD entertainment system, and a navigation system.|$|R
50|$|The Shuttle-C {{concept as}} a <b>cargo</b> only <b>option</b> was not funded in the 1980s and 1990s due to NASA's {{budgetary}} constraints. The 2004-2005 industry study provided an updated proposal, which was looked at by ESAS but was ultimately deemed {{inferior to the}} Ares I and Ares V option. Crewed side-mounted Shuttle-C concepts were not looked at all in ESAS.|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{evaluation is}} conducted for next-generation Space Shuttle-type system configurations, {{in light of}} mission and design goals, performance and operational requirements, and technology development needs and opportunities. <b>Cargo</b> vehicle <b>options</b> presently entertained are an unmanned Shuttle Derivative Vehicle and a Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle. Two high priority manned vehicle options are small (35, 000 -lb payload) and large (150, 000 -lb payload) fully reusable vehicles. Attention is given to single stage vs. two-stage 'Shuttle II' system performance and economic projections...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} multirole <b>cargo</b> aircraft <b>options</b> and configurations. It {{was shown}} that derivatives of current wide-body aircraft would be economically attractive through 2008, but new dedicated airfreighters incorporating 1990 technology would offer {{little or no}} economic incentive. Option studies indicate that Mach 0. 7 propfans would be economically attractive in trip cost, aircraft price, and airline ROI; spanloaders would be lower priced with higher ROI, but would have a relatively higher trip cost because of aerodynamic inefficiencies. Finally, air cushion landing gear configurations are identified as an option for avoiding runway constraints on airport accommodation of very large airfreighters...|$|R
5000|$|The LUV's {{exterior}} was updated slightly for the 1974 model year, but {{the first}} major update came in the 1976 model year, when a three-speed automatic transmission option and front disc brakes were added. Power was up to [...] for 1977, and sales continued to rise. An exterior refresh {{and the addition of}} a 2285 mm <b>cargo</b> bay <b>option,</b> with longer 2995 mm wheelbase, brought sales up to 71,145 in 1978. The addition of four-wheel drive in 1979 brought the LUV to the attention of Motor Trend magazine, and earned it their second [...] "Truck of the Year" [...] award. Sales peaked at 100,192.|$|R
40|$|Mantle cell {{lymphoma}} (MCL) is {{an extremely}} difficult to treat subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with a low patient survival rate compared to most common cancers. Recently, nanoparticle delivery systems have received {{a great deal of}} interest for treating NHL. One of the more promising <b>cargo</b> <b>options</b> for these systems is short interfering RNA (siRNA). siRNA is a 18 - 23 nucleotide long double stranded RNA that is used to inhibit the protein expression of target mRNAs in a sequence specific manner. MCLs have several commonly overexpressed genes compared to normal cells making it an ideal candidate for siRNA therapies. For RNA interference to occur, A delivery vehicle is needed for the siRNA to reach the cytoplasm of the cell. In this thesis, ionizable lipid-like materials termed lipidoids are formulated into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver siRNA. A new library of lipidoids is constructed {{to gain a better understanding}} of how the lipidoid tail-structure affects the silencing ability of LNPs. A novel tail precursor is identified as conferring potency to LNPs. Then, LNPs are used to silence genes within difficult to transfect MCL cells. LNPs targeting the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl- 1 exhibit potent gene silencing and cause an increase in the fraction of cells undergoing apoptosis. This is important because there is no therapeutic that is FDA approved that targets this commonly overexpressed protein. Because of this LNPâ€™s potency, siRNAs targeting multiple genes can be encapsulated into LNPs without causing unwanted toxicity. LNPs targeting several genes in multiple pathways cause a larger fraction of MCL cells to undergo apoptosis compared to cells treated with LNPs targeting only one gene. A major issue in cancer therapeutics is that the majority of nanoparticles accumulate in the liver. In an effort to improve the delivery of LNPs to target cells, changes to their formulations and administration methods are investigated as a means to improve LNP circulation time, biodistribution, and silencing ability. Overall, this work identifies lipidoid nanoparticles as potent siRNA delivery systems to treat MCL and investigates key properties for further improvement in LNP siRNA delivery to target cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{benefits}} of the reusable Space Shuttle {{and the advent of}} the new Space Station hold promise for increasingly effective utilization of space by the scientific and commercial as well as military communities. A high energy reusable oribital transfer vehicle (OTV) represents an additional capability which also exhibits potential for enhancing space access by allowing more ambitious missions {{and at the same time}} reducing launch costs when compared to existing upper stages. This section, Vol. 2 : Book 4, covers launch operations and flight operations. The launch operations section covers analyses of ground based and space based vehicles, launch site facilities, logistics requirements, propellant loading, space based maintenance and aft <b>cargo</b> carrier access <b>options.</b> The flight operations sections contain summary descriptions of ground based and space based OTV missions, operations and support requirements, and a discussion of fleet implications...|$|R
40|$|The Ground Processing Simulator (GPS) is a {{computer-assisted}} planning tool {{designed and}} developed for Space Shuttle launch site application. Utilizing two programming languages, General Purpose Simulation System and FORTRAN, GPS provides {{the capability to}} analyze proposed Shuttle mission models via computer simulation. NASA-developed mission models which specify Shuttle launch rates, mission durations, cargo elements, and designated launch site are tested for feasibility by the simulator. GPS produces facility utilization schedules (including the identification of conflicts), launch data <b>options,</b> <b>cargo</b> element requirement dates, ground support equipment inventory requirements, and other data necessary to assess both the programmatic and launch site resources required to support proposed mission models. The purpose of this computer-assisted analysis is to determine methods which will permit the launching of {{the maximum number of}} cargoes per year on schedule, and in the sequence desired, with the minimum expenditure of resources...|$|R
500|$|An {{important}} role in the upcoming campaign was played by 21 Dutch Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij (KPM) refugee ships of [...] These, along with two other refugee ships and six vessels originally intended for the Shipping Control Board, were transferred to American control. During 1942, [...] of cargo was carried by chartered ships, of which [...] was coastal <b>cargo.</b> Lacking other <b>options,</b> resort was made to using ships on overseas voyages to carry coastal cargo. Between April and November 1942, this averaged [...] each month. In addition, the Australian Army operated five troopships: the [...] and , which could each carry 1,500 troops; and the smaller Gorgon, [...] and Ormiston, which carried between 590 and 650 troops each. Having separate American and Australian shipping organisations saved the two armies from having to learn each other's procedures while still trying to master their own, but it created inefficiencies through the need for coordination.|$|R
40|$|Work {{completed}} {{under the}} Human Transportation System Study is summarized. This {{study was conducted}} by the New Initiatives Office at JSC with the technical support of Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed, McDonnell-Douglas, Martin Marietta, and Rockwell. The {{study was designed to}} generate information on determining the appropriate path to follow for new system development to meet the Nation's space transportation needs. The study evaluates 18 transportation architecture options using a parametric set of mission requirements. These options include use of current systems as well as proposed systems {{to assess the impact of}} various considerations, such as the cost of alternate access, or the benefit of separating people and <b>cargo.</b> The architecture <b>options</b> are compared to each other with six measurable evaluation criteria or attributes. They are the following: funding profile, human safety, probability of mission success, architecture cost risk, launch schedule confidence, and environmental impact. Values for these attributes are presented for the architecture options, with pertinent conclusions and recommendations...|$|R
40|$|United States {{oil imports}} are {{predominantly}} carried in non-U. S. ships, {{a fact that}} some interpret as an energy security problem whose solution lies in increasing federal assistance to U. S. shipbuilding and shipping industries. This paper examines three options (one regulatory, two budgetary) for such federal assistance. Examination of the options comprises estimates of relative costs, consequences for traditional U. S. maritime goals, and implications for national security. The options are found to differ significantly in respect to relative cost and capacity to meet military security needs. As background, the paper also analyzes the costs of U. S. shipbuilding and shipping industries relative to their foreign counterparts. It thereby indicates why, and how much, federal assistance {{would be required to}} satisfy national security goals. The paper concludes that the regulatory policy <b>option</b> (<b>cargo</b> preference) has the highest relative cost and is the least effective for meeting national security goals.
