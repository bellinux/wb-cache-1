In particular, EN 15316 and its sub-sections, determine the system energy requirements and the system efficiencies of space heating system. This paper focuses on the estimation of efficiencies for emission of hydronic radiators. The assessment of efficiencies for emission occurs by evaluating the amount of heat emitted  from the heat emitter and the extra thermal losses towards building envelope. The heat emitted from radiators varies during the heating up/cooling down phases. A factor that influences the heat emitted during these phases is the location of <b>connection</b> <b>pipes</b> of the radiator. <b>Connection</b> <b>pipes</b> can be located on opposite side or at {{the same side of}} the radiator. To better estimate the heat emitted from radiators a transient model with multiple storage elements is used in a building simulation model. Sensitivity analysis encompasses all  the possible variations on extra thermal losses due to the building location in different climates, the heaviness of active thermal mass and the type of radiator local control. The final outcome of this paper is a practical support where the designer can easily assess the efficiencies for emission of hydronic radiators  for Swedish buildings. As main result, (i) the efficiency for control of space heating system is higher in Northern climates than in Southern climates, (ii) heavy active thermal masses allow higher efficiencies for emission than light active thermal masses, (iii) <b>connection</b> <b>pipes</b> located on {{the same side of the}} radiator enable higher efficiencies for emission than pipes located on opposite side...|$|R

Therefore, getting detailed hydrogen flow and distribution is a key issue to arrange hydrogen removal equipment in the containment compartments. In this study, hydrogen flow behavior in local compartments has been investigated in two horizontal compartments. The analysis model is built by 3 -dimensional CFD code in Cartesian coordinates based on the connection structure of the Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) compartments. It consists of two cylindrical vessels, representing the Steam Generator compartment (SG) and Core Makeup Tank compartment (CMT).

As we usually treat large-volume data in grid computing environment, we need the technology that enables the high speed and large scale trans-mission in a network. In conventional TCP/IP, however, {{it is difficult to}} achieve good performance because of overhead caused by packet processing and retransmission of lost packets. In this thesis, we propose a new computing environment (which we refer to λ computing envi-ronment) that provides a infrastructure for parallel computing among computing nodes distributed in the wide area. Network switches and computing nodes are connected each other with optical fibers in the λ computing environment, thereby offering high-speed and reliable <b>connection</b> <b>pipe</b> among end computing nodes. Moreover, optical fibers are directly connected to each memory of computing nodes, so that a shared memory is constituted between the computing nodes.

In this thesis, we establish the λ computing environment using the AWG-STAR system which has a shared memory in hardware and aim to execute OpenMP application, the de-facto standard of the shared memory parallel computing. To execute parallel computation, we design and imple-ment synchronization primitives and data sharing structure of the AWG-STAR system.

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of German reactor safety {{research}} the thermal-hydraulic behaviour in accumulators was investigated experimentally and analytically for transient injection. The paper includes the description of two test facilities used for separate effect experiments for the discharge flow of accumulators. Results derived from experiments at a glass facility show the dependency of the nitrogen release processes in the water on the depressurization rate during negative pressure transients and a delay of release. This release delay caused oversaturated solutions and this effect {{has to be taken}} into account for the modelling of accumulators. It was not observed coalescence of nitrogen bubbles during rising but the appearance of humid nitrogen above the liquid level. At the test facility TRACEI separate effect experiments were carried out for the investigation of the heat and mass transfer to the nitrogen cushion, the release of nitrogen out of saturated pressurized water and the multidimensional distribution of the gas temperature. The measured data in the nitrogen cushion show different conditions of humid nitrogen such as unsaturated and saturated humid nitrogen, the occurrence of water droplets in terms of fog and frozen fog. Intensive distributions of temperature and humidity above the liquid level were detected during fast pressure gradients, hence high depressurization rates. Post test calculations were accomplished with the ATHLET-Code Mod. 1. 2 Cycle B for selected TRACEI separate effect experiments. The comparison of calculated results and experimental data shows well calculated liquid level decreasing and a good agreement of the pressure transient even if the friction pressure loss coefficients of the <b>connection</b> <b>pipe</b> between the accumulator simulator and the venting vessel were adapted. Deviations between simulations and experiments arised in calculating the cushion gas temperature. In order to improve the simulation quality it was suggested to calculate the enthalpy, the density, and accordingly the specific volume and the volumetric gas fraction, respectively the volumetric water fraction, by a model of humid nitrogen bearing analogy to the model of humid air in consideration of the basic equations used in the ATHLET-code. The modelling for releasing of solved nitrogen in the water nodes contains a source term of volumetric gas release rate subjected to pressure and depressurization rate and approaches for the determination of bubble rising velocities of the nitrogen bubbles in water.
