A typical {{application}} is a sliding or reciprocating motion that requires lubrication to minimize wear, as, for example, in gear and <b>chain</b> <b>lubrication.</b> Liquid lubricants will squeeze out while solid lubricants do not escape, preventing fretting, corrosion, and galling.|$|E

5000|$|Brown was {{a proponent}} of fixed-gear, single-speed {{bicycles}} for ordinary street use. Brown, with Galen Evans and Osman Isvan, developed a method to determine and compare bicycle gear ratios. For any combination of front chainring, rear cog, wheel size and crank length, his method results in a number that Brown terms the [...] "gain ratio". Also, Brown expressed personal opinions on <b>chain</b> cleaning, <b>lubrication</b> and wear, a source of controversy {{in the field of}} bicycle maintenance.|$|R
50|$|O-ring {{chains are}} most notably used in motorcycles, {{one of the}} most {{demanding}} applications for a metal chain. High rpm and heavy loads require bulky chains, but such engineering increases the effect of friction compared to lighter <b>chains.</b> So <b>lubrication</b> plays a vital role here, but the high rpm also make it very difficult to keep lubrication inside and on the chain. Additionally, motorcycle chains are exposed to a large volume of contaminants and particles and must be protected. O-rings, as described above, fit this application perfectly.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} motorbike's chain transmission, {{focusing on}} <b>chain</b> <b>lubrication</b> {{and its effect}} on the temperature, efficiency and vibrations of the transmission. Purpose of the paper is to compare transmission's performances under three different lubrication conditions: (i) chain not lubricated at all, (ii) chain lubricated with a spray PTFE addicted lube, and (ii) chain lubricated with a mineral oil at every minute of the test. An experimental campaign has been performed running a chain under the three above lube conditions at different speeds with the purposes of: (A) measuring the effect that each lube conditions has on temperature, on vibrations and on the efficiency of the transmission, and (B) identify the best conditions for practical use. A test rig has been designed and manufactured for the purpose, and temperature, transmission's efficiency and vibrations have been recorded during the tests by using a thermocamera, a dynamometer and an accelerometer respectively. Results showed that a proper lubrication is desirable. Additionally using a continuous lubrication with a mineral oil lubricant leads to better transmission compared {{to the use of the}} spray PTFE from the efficiency and thermal points of view. This work presents an experimental investigation on the effect of two different kind of lubrication form motorbike chain on transmission’s efficiency. The findings are still valid for different applications of chain transmission in dirty environments. Novelty of the paper is following highlighted: 1. this is the first work scientifically facing the important topic of lubrication of chain in dirty environments, particularly of motorbike chain; 2. a complete analysis of thermal and mechanical effect due to presence of lubricant has never been shown; 3. different kind of lubricant have been used and their effect has been separately highlighted...|$|E
50|$|The engine {{displacement}} was equal to 1300 cc, patterned after the previous experience on a Fiat monoblock. It was constructed fully from aluminium by Bandini and features a dry sump <b>lubrication,</b> <b>chain</b> distribution, double overhead camshafts, and 16 valves. The fuel injection is mechanical, and all is {{hooked up to}} a five-speed manual gearbox.|$|R
50|$|Lack of lubrication: <b>chain</b> {{bearings}} require <b>lubrication</b> {{in order}} to reduce friction. The chain pull that the drive experiences can double if the bearings are not lubricated. This can cause the system to overload by either its mechanical or electrical overload protection. On conveyors that go through hot ovens, lubricators can be left on constantly or set to turn on every few cycles.|$|R
40|$|Similarly to {{many other}} countries, the use of biologically degradable oils in {{forestry}} is also addressed by the Czech law. Several studies point out several technical problems regarding such regulations. It has not been demonstrated so far whether for example biologically degradable engine oils used for <b>chain</b> saw <b>lubrication</b> from mixture may {{be the cause of}} an excessive engine wear or deterioration of the combustion process and hence increased contamination of air inhaled by the operator. An experimental laboratory measurement was taken for the purpose of determining the external characteristics of a common chain saw engine at a brake stand, which enabled exact measurement of differences in engine output, fuel consumption and composition of exhaust gases (CO, CO 2, and HC), namely in dependence on the type of oil and the blending ratio. The results of the laboratory tests did not reveal any statistically significant differences between the oils in any of the measured criteria. The theory of workers based on practical experience that some oils may cause clogging of the fine fuel filter in the carburettor and that increased carbon sedimentation occurs in the engine exhaust duct was neither displaced by evidence, nor corroborated. Its refutation or confirmation would only be possible {{on the basis of a}} longer service test...|$|R
50|$|The {{top frame}} tube of the Tiger Cub {{was lower than}} normal, leaving the {{headstock}} poorly supported. Some rigidity was recovered by internal bracing of the petrol tank. A plain bearing on the timing side main bearing sometimes wore rapidly. The primary chain ran in a shallow oil-bath but if the level dropped, the <b>chain</b> could suffer <b>lubrication</b> failure and stretch. The chain was not tensioned - and even worse, the primary chain case on early models was a slightly 'waisted' shape. A worn chain could strike both {{the inside of the}} cover and the crankcase itself, making the oil-level even more difficult to maintain in the future. Another common complaint was that the Cub would travel at highway speed (50 mph) for 1/2 hour and then stop unexpectedly. Some attributed this to overheating, but a cure was never found.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. To modify the rheological behaviour of rubber compounds, {{in order to improve}} their processing behaviour, lubricants based on fatty acid derivatives are added at the mixing stage. This research has been directed towards identifying the modes of action of commercially available lubricants in a number of elastomers and elastomer compounds, with the objective of providing a rational basis for the further development of lubricants. The primary tool for rheological measurement was an advanced biconical rotor rheometer (Negretti TMS Rheometer); and a capillary rheometer was used to provide an independent verification of results. Conceptual and mathematical models have been proposed which provide a rational explanation and simulation of lubricant action. The conceptual model takes account of elastomer morphology, relative solubility parameters of elastomer and lubricant and chemical reactions between the lubricant and elastomer in order to explain internal <b>lubrication,</b> <b>chain</b> extension/crosslinking, solvation and external lubrication. The mathematical model simulates the primary lubricant actions of internal <b>lubrication</b> and <b>chain</b> extension/cross-linking...|$|R
40|$|We used {{a surface}} forces {{apparatus}} to investigate layering transitions and frictional properties of chain alcohol films. All {{but the last}} two monolayers, strongly bound to each mica surface can be removed by squeezing. Unlike other systems however, chain alcohol films of undecanol and octanol were found to retain their bulk-like lubrication properties down to a thickness of only one (bi) layer. The transition where this last molecularly thin liquid layer is expelled from the gap proceeds in less than one second. From two-dimensional snapshots of the contact area during the expulsion process, {{we find that the}} boundary line between the areas of initial and final film thickness bends and roughens as it moves across the contact area. In the final state, we frequently find pockets of trapped liquid. Both the bending and roughening of the boundary line and the trapped pockets are due to a dynamic instability that we describe with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The length scale of the roughening is determined by an elastic line tension.
