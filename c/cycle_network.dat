5|$|Separating {{provision}} for cyclists from other road traffic {{was not part}} of the remit of the 1960s town redevelopment, and in 1996 the perception of {{provision for}} cyclists was very poor. A Basingstoke Area Cycling Strategy was developed in 1999 and subsequently an extensive <b>cycle</b> <b>network</b> has been developed mainly utilising on-road routes or off-road routes that run parallel with and directly alongside roads. Basingstoke was linked to Reading on the National <b>Cycle</b> <b>Network</b> route 23 in May 2003 and the route was extended south to Alton and Alresford in April 2006.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 We will {{describe}} two known strategies for static processor allocation in an n-cube multiprocessor, namely the buddy system strategy and the gray code strategy, and then propose {{a new strategy}} that outperforms the first by (n-k+ 1) and the second by (n-k+ 1) / 2 in cube recognition. Furthermore, our strategy is suitable for static as well as dynamic processor allocation and results in less system fragmentation, more subcubes recognition and higher fault tolerance. We also introduce an extension to our strategy that will enhance the performance drastically so that our algorithm, together with the extension, will outperform the buddy system {{by a factor of}} [k(n-k) + 1] and the gray strategy by [k(n-k) + 1]/ 2 in cube recognition. The implementation details of these algorithms are also described. The cube-connected <b>cycles</b> <b>network</b> is an attractive alternative for the n-cube, since it overcomes the degree problem by limiting it to 3. However, there are large gaps in the size of systems that can be built. We propose and study cube-connected <b>cycles</b> <b>networks</b> that are missing some of their cycles, called incomplete cube-connected <b>cycles</b> <b>networks.</b> These incomplete cube-connected <b>cycles</b> <b>networks</b> can be used to interconnect systems with any number of processors, thus overcoming the severe restriction of the complete cube-connected <b>cycles</b> <b>networks.</b> In incomplete cube-connected networks the processors are well utilized, routes are shorter and the layout area is a lot smaller. We develop efficient routing and broadcasting algorithms and show how to lay this network on a chip. Broadcasting is a procedure by which a processor can pass a message to all other processors in the network nonredundantly. It is extremely important for diagnosis of the network, distribution agreement and clock synchronization. We briefly describe the algorithm for broadcasting in the hypercube developed by Sullivan and Bashkow, then we develop a simple yet efficient fault tolerant broadcasting algorithm for the hypercube in the presence of some faulty processors. We develop an efficient algorithm for broadcasting in the cube-connected <b>cycles</b> <b>network.</b> Another broadcasting algorithm for cube-connected <b>cycles</b> <b>networks</b> with faulty <b>cycles</b> is also developed...|$|R
30|$|Thus far, the {{aforementioned}} works assume an always-on network, whereby all nodes remain awake indefinitely, meaning, {{they do not}} employ any duty cycle regime. To this end, {{there are only a}} handful of works related to broadcast in duty <b>cycled</b> wireless <b>networks.</b> Lai and Ravindran [17] and Hong et al. [18] designed centralized and distributed broadcast algorithms for duty <b>cycled</b> <b>networks</b> that aim {{to reduce the number of}} transmissions. In particular, the two methods proposed in [19] have an approximation ratio of 3 (lnΔ+ 1) and 20 in terms of the number of transmissions, respectively, where Δ is the maximum degree. These works, however, have not addressed the MLBSDC problem in duty <b>cycled</b> <b>networks.</b>|$|R
5|$|The National <b>Cycle</b> <b>Network,</b> {{a network}} of cycle routes in the United Kingdom, {{includes}} two routes through Ashford. These are NCR 17 from Rochester to Hythe and NCR 18 from Canterbury to Tunbridge Wells.

5|$|Bridgwater Docks, {{in which}} the tidal basin, locks, quaysides, bridges and {{fittings}} are listed buildings, is now a marina, and the old warehouse, built in 184050 has been converted into apartments, with new apartment blocks built nearby. The only commercially active industry located at the docks is Bowering's Animal Feed Mill. The towpath forms part of Sustrans' National <b>Cycle</b> <b>Network</b> route NCR-3 connecting Bath and Cornwall, and attracts numerous travellers. Plans have been proposed for the upgrading of the towpath and development of a visitor centre at Maunsel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Many {{well-known}} interconnection networks, such as k-ary n-cubes, recursive circulant graphs, generalized recursive circulant graphs, circulant graphs and so on, {{are shown}} {{to belong to}} the family of <b>cycle</b> composition <b>networks.</b> Recently, various studies about mutually independent hamiltonian cycles, abbreviated as MIHC’s, on interconnection networks are published. In this paper, using an improved construction method, we obtain MIHC’s on <b>cycle</b> composition <b>networks</b> with a much weaker condition than the known result.
