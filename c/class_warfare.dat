5|$|The {{events have}} since become a highly mythologized and {{symbolic}} {{story of the}} Wild West, {{and over the years}} variations of the storyline have come to include some of its most famous historical figures. In addition to being one of the most well-known range wars of the American frontier, its themes, especially <b>class</b> <b>warfare,</b> served as a basis for numerous popular novels, films, and television shows in the Western genre.|$|E
5|$|Conscious {{and planned}} {{colonization}} of the fertile, but underdeveloped region was pioneered in the 1580s and 1590s by the Ruthenian dukes of Volhynia. Of the Poles, only Jan Zamoyski, who penetrated the Bracław area, was economically active {{by the end}} of the 16th century. There and in the Kiev area Polish fortunes also began to develop, often through intermarriage with Ruthenian clans. In 1630, the great Ukrainian latifundia were dominated by Ruthenian families, such as the Ostrogski, Zbaraski and Zasławski. At the outset of the great civil war of 1648, the Polish settlers comprised barely 10% of the middle and petty nobility, for example in the well-researched Bracław Voivodeship and Kiev Voivodeship. The early Cossack rebellions were, therefore, instants of social uprising, rather than national anti-Polish movements. As <b>class</b> <b>warfare</b> they were ruthlessly stamped out by the state, which would sometimes take their leaders to Warsaw for execution.|$|E
5|$|The Johnson County War, {{with its}} overtones of <b>class</b> <b>warfare</b> {{coupled with the}} {{intervention}} ordered by the President of the United States to {{save the lives of}} a gang of hired killers and set them free, is not a flattering reflection on the American myth of the west. The Johnson County War {{has been one of the}} best-known range wars of the frontier. It has been a popular feature of the Western genre of fiction, which includes literature, films and television shows. The Banditti of the Plains, written in 1894 by witness Asa Shinn Mercer, is the earliest record of the Johnson County War. The book was suppressed for many years by the WSGA, who seized and destroyed all but a few of the first edition copies from the 1894 printing; they were rumored to have hijacked and destroyed the second printing as it was being shipped from a printer north of Denver, Colorado. The book was reprinted several times in the 20th century and most recently in 2015. Frances McElrath's novel 1902 The Rustler, took inspiration from the Johnson County War, and was sympathetic to the perspective of the small ranchers.|$|E

His insistence on the open-cast mining of the park of the Wentworth Woodhouse estate, to the doorsteps of the house, when {{the quality of the}} coal was poor, was viewed by its owners and the local mining community, which opposed it, as pure vindictiveness - an act of <b>class</b> <b>warfare.</b> In 1947-8 he was Chairman of the Labour Party.|$|E

25|$|John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry sent a {{shock wave}} across the South. When the Thirty-sixth Congress met in December 1859 {{the first order}} of {{business}} was the selection of a speaker. Already in turmoil over the Brown raid, Southerners were further aggravated by the nomination of Ohio Republican John Sherman for the post. Sherman was one of 68 Republicans who had endorsed Hinton Helper’s book, The Impending Crisis and How to Meet It, which Southerners believed would ignite <b>class</b> <b>warfare</b> between slaveholders and non-slaveholders in the South. Republicans proposed buying 100,000 copies of the book and distributing it throughout the country. Miles conspired with South Carolina's governor to send a regiment of militia to Washington to break up the Congress in the event of Sherman's election, but the withdrawal of Sherman's nomination prevented action.|$|E
25|$|On March 13, 1937, the NLRB {{issued a}} {{decision}} finding Remington Rand guilty of violating federal labor law. The decision, Remington Rand, Inc., 2 NLRB 626, was an astonishing 120-page decision {{in which the}} Board recounted nearly every anti-union tactic the company had undertaken in the last year. The Board accused Rand of putting himself above the law and wantonly violating the National Labor Relations Act. The Board's discussion of Remington Rand's actions was cast in moral terms. Although many of the actions were not necessarily illegal, the Board was deeply distressed that {{the company and its}} president would engage in behavior which, in the Board's view, constituted open economic and <b>class</b> <b>warfare.</b> The NLRB ordered Remington Rand to reinstate, with back pay, the union members who had been discharged, to reinstate all workers still on strike, to dismantle its company unions, and recognize the union in its six existing plants as well as the new plant in Elmira.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, {{industrialisation}} in Germany must {{be considered}} to have been positive in its effects. Not only did it change society and the countryside, and finally the world...it created the modern world we live in. It solved the problems of population growth, under-employment and pauperism in a stagnating economy, and abolished dependency on the natural conditions of agriculture, and finally hunger. It created huge improvements in production and both short- and long-term improvements in living standards. However, {{in terms of social}} inequality, it can be assumed that it did not change the relative levels of income. Between 1815 and 1873 the statistical distribution of wealth was on the order of 77% to 23% for entrepreneurs and workers respectively. On the other hand, new problems arose, in the form of interrupted growth and new crises, such as urbanisation, 'alienation', new underclasses, proletariat and proletarian misery, new injustices and new masters and, eventually, <b>class</b> <b>warfare.</b>|$|E

Cabinet minister Winston Churchill publicly demanded a general election, for which Asquith apologised to the King's adviser Lord Knollys and rebuked Churchill at a Cabinet meeting. Edward was so dispirited at the tone of <b>class</b> <b>warfare</b> – although Asquith told him that party rancour had been just as bad over the First Home Rule Bill in 1886 – that he introduced his son to Secretary of State for War Richard Haldane as [...] "the last King of England".

500|$|Many of the {{conflicts}} and political dimensions of Star Trek represent allegories of contemporary cultural realities. Star Trek: The Original Series addressed {{issues of the}} 1960s, just as later spin-offs have reflected issues of their respective decades. Issues depicted in the various series include war and peace, the value of personal loyalty, authoritarianism, imperialism, <b>class</b> <b>warfare,</b> economics, racism, religion, human rights, sexism, feminism, {{and the role of}} technology. Roddenberry stated: [...] " [...] a new world with new rules, I could make statements about sex, religion, Vietnam, politics, and intercontinental missiles. Indeed, we did make them on Star Trek: we were sending messages and fortunately they all got by the network." [...] "If you talked about purple people on a far off planet, they (the TV network) never really caught on. They were more concerned about cleavage. They actually would send a censor down to the set to measure a woman's cleavage to make sure too much of her breast wasn't showing" ...|$|E
50|$|In Turner's view, {{rather than}} simply failing to develop modern technologies, economics, and ways of living, {{at some point in}} their history (upwards of 130,000 years), the Aborigines made a {{conscious}} decision to turn toward more socially and spiritually meaningful pursuits. They turned away from technology, and toward each other.

500|$|Many critics {{compared}} and contrasted Lazarus {{with other}} genre works. The timeliness of Rucka's premise made the series stand out among dystopian fiction for IGN reviewer Melissa Grey. Garrett Martin wrote in Paste Magazine that {{the series was}} unlike other contemporary <b>class</b> <b>warfare</b> genre fiction like Hunger Games or Blackacre because it is told from the oppressors' point of view. Oliver Sava reviewed the series for The A.V. Club and said it stood out from Image's other science fiction comics [...] "because it's more grounded in current political and economic trends". In {{a review of the}} first issue for Behind the Panels, Richard Gray felt Lazarus did too little to set itself apart from similar books. Rucka specifically addressed fan-drawn parallels to Game of Thrones, saying he had not read the books and purposely avoids watching the show to avoid unintentionally borrowing ideas from it. Lark thinks the comparison to Game of Thrones works to some extent, but points out that Lazarus concentrates more on a single character.|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{publication}} of [...] in 1893, Crane was recognized by critics mainly as a novelist. [...] Maggie was initially rejected by numerous publishers because of its atypical and true-to-life depictions of <b>class</b> <b>warfare,</b> which clashed with the sentimental tales of that time. Rather than focusing on the very rich or middle class, the novel's characters are lower-class denizens of New York's Bowery. The main character, Maggie, descends into prostitution after being led astray by her lover. [...] Although the novel's plot is simple, its dramatic mood, quick pace and portrayal of Bowery life have made it memorable. [...] Maggie is not merely an account of slum life, but also represents eternal symbols. In his first draft, Crane did not give his characters proper names. Instead, they were identified by epithets: Maggie, for example, was the girl who [...] "blossomed in a mud-puddle" [...] and Pete, her seducer, was a [...] "knight". The novel is dominated by bitter irony and anger, as well as destructive morality and treacherous sentiment. Critics would later call the novel [...] "the first dark flower of American Naturalism" [...] for its distinctive elements of naturalistic fiction.|$|E
500|$|Returning to Mqhekezweni in December 1940, Mandela {{found that}} Jongintaba had {{arranged}} marriages {{for him and}} Justice; dismayed, they fled to Johannesburg via Queenstown, arriving in April 1941. Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines, his [...] "first sight of South African capitalism in action", but was fired when the induna (headman) discovered {{that he was a}} runaway. He stayed with a cousin in George Goch Township, who introduced Mandela to realtor and ANC activist Walter Sisulu. The latter secured Mandela a job as an articled clerk at the law firm of Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman, a company run by Lazar Sidelsky, a liberal Jew sympathetic to the ANC's cause. At the firm, Mandela befriended Gaur Radebe—a Xhosa member of the ANC and Communist Party—and Nat Bregman, a Jewish communist who became his first white friend. Mandela attended Communist Party gatherings, where he was impressed that Europeans, Africans, Indians, and Coloureds mixed as equals. He later stated that he did not join the Party because its atheism conflicted with his Christian faith, and because he saw the South African struggle as being racially based rather than as <b>class</b> <b>warfare.</b> To continue his higher education, Mandela signed up to a University of South Africa correspondence course, working on his bachelor's degree at night.|$|E
