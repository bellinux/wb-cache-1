40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the critical wear levels of the <b>contact</b> <b>wire</b> of the catenary on metropolitan lines. The study has focussed on the zones of <b>contact</b> <b>wire</b> where localised wear is produced, normally associated with the appearance of electric arcs. To this end, a finite element model has been developed to study the dynamics of pantograph-catenary interaction. The model includes a zone of localised wear and a singularity in the <b>contact</b> <b>wire</b> in order to simulate the worst case scenario from the point of view of stresses. 	In order to consider the different stages in the wire wear process, different depths and widths of the localised wear zone were defined. The results of the dynamic simulations performed for each stage of wear let the area of the minimum resistant section of the <b>contact</b> <b>wire</b> be determined for which stresses are greater than the allowable stress. 	The maximum tensile stress reached in the <b>contact</b> <b>wire</b> shows a clear sensitivity to the size of the local wear zone, defined by its width and depth. In this way, if the wear measurements taken with an overhead line recording vehicle are analysed, it will be possible to calculate the potential breakage risk of the wire. A strong dependence of the tensile forces of the <b>contact</b> <b>wire</b> has also been observed. These results will allow priorities to be set for replacing the most critical sections of wire, thereby making maintenance much more efficient. The results obtained show that the wire replacement criteria currently borne in mind have turned out to be appropriate, although in some wear scenarios these criteria could be adjusted even more, and so prolong the life cycle of the <b>contact</b> <b>wire...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{method by}} which current is {{collected}} from overhead contact lines over the tracks via pantographs is widely used to supply power to EMUs and electric locomotives. Pantographs were first installed to trains in operation in Japan in 1914. Then, in 1922, the former Japanese National Railways completed the installation of pantographs to all electric locomotives and EMUs. Thus, pantographs have been playing the main role in current collection for rolling stock in Japan for nearly a century. The most important function required of pantographs is to collect the required current efficiently to vehicles when needed. To do that, pantographs need to have conductivity and capacity appropriate to their usage. These functions also should be maintained even in high speed running. Factors that determine the current collectivity of pantographs are largely classified into two factors: dynamic performance of the pantograph and wear resistance between the contact strip and the <b>contact</b> <b>wire.</b> Pantographs absolutely must follow the vertical deviation of the <b>contact</b> <b>wire</b> even in high speed running without fail. Contact strips are installed {{to the top of}} a pantograph that <b>contacts</b> the <b>contact</b> <b>wire,</b> (Fig. 1). If a pantograph cannot follow the <b>contact</b> <b>wire</b> and <b>contact</b> strips lose <b>contact</b> to the <b>wire</b> while large current is flowing, arcs are generated or current collection worsens. Such a situation is called contact loss. Arcs caused by contact loss increase wear of contact strips and contact wire; and in worse case scenarios, they break both. If <b>contact</b> <b>wire</b> or <b>contact</b> strips wear easily or cause wear on each other, that results in shorter lifespan and increase in maintenance expenses. Based on these factors, the Technical Center is carrying out R&D projects with an aim of extending lifespan of both of <b>contact</b> <b>wires</b> and <b>contact</b> strips by decreasing wear of those.
