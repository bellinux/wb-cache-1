50|$|Flange mounts—Very {{strong and}} rigid, but have little {{tolerance}} for misalignment. Experts recommend cap end mounts for thrust loads and rod end mounts where major loading puts the piston rod in tension. Three types are head rectangular flange, head square flange or rectangular head. <b>Flange</b> <b>mounts</b> function optimally when the mounting face attaches to a machine support member.|$|R

Stresses went down significantly with the corrections of the flange detail. The fields and field transients during a disruption were applied using vector potential boundary conditions. The changing fields are imposed, throughout the space the coupler occupies, thus the inductive response of the coupler has no effect on altering the local fields. The assumption is that the field transients are driven predominantly by all the structure...|$|R

The simulation results show that the selected control strategy has quick response and good robustness, which satisfies the real-time requirements of the grinding and polishing force control in processing...|$|R
50|$|A full-diameter non-fast-opening {{rear door}} costs little, all things considered. On larger machines, {{it can be}} mounted on a hinge, davit, or dolly {{assembly}} (see photo above) that allows it to be swung or {{moved away from the}} autoclave once its bolted <b>flange</b> <b>mounting</b> has been separated. This provides the best possible access to the works inside. It also means that critical components are never buried deep inside the machine where they are hard to get at and thus very likely to be ignored until they cause problems. One mid-sized autoclave built for a southern aircraft repair shop to be as cheap as humanly possible lacked easy access to the circulation fan, and, when last observed by one of the manufacturer's service engineers, was making the most alarming dry-bearing noises whenever it ran.|$|R

50|$|Rotating paddle level sensors are a {{very old}} and {{established}} technique for bulk solid point level indication. The technique uses a low-speed gear motor that rotates a paddle wheel. When the paddle is stalled by solid materials, the motor is rotated on its shaft by its own torque until a <b>flange</b> <b>mounted</b> on the motor contacts a mechanical switch. The paddle can be constructed {{from a variety of}} materials, but tacky material must not be allowed to build up on the paddle. Build-up may occur if the process material becomes tacky because of high moisture levels or high ambient humidity in the hopper. For materials with very low weight per unit volume such as Pearlite, Bentonite or fly ash, special paddle designs and low-torque motors are used. Fine particles or dust must be prevented from penetrating the shaft bearings and motor by proper placement of the paddle in the hopper or bin and using appropriate seals.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{audio tape}} recorder was a non-magnetic, non-electric version invented by Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory and patented in 1886 (...) [...] It employed a 3/16 in strip of wax-covered paper that was coated by dipping it {{in a solution}} of beeswax and paraffin and then had one side scraped clean, with the other side allowed to harden. The machine was of sturdy wood and metal construction, and hand-powered {{by means of a}} knob fastened to the flywheel. The wax strip passed from one eight-inch reel around the periphery of a pulley (with guide <b>flanges)</b> <b>mounted</b> above the V-pulleys on the main vertical shaft, where it came in contact with either its recording or playback stylus. The tape was then taken up on the other reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a vibrating mica diaphragm, cut the wax from the strip. In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus, attached to a rubber diaphragm, carried the reproduced sounds through an ear tube to its listener.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{fatigue test}} of a {{full-scale}} aircraft body aims to understand the initiation and development of fatigue damage and fatigue crack of its critical structures, and hence to determine fatigue life, maintenance and repairing cycles. The work of non-destructive testing and acoustic emission (AE) monitoring during the whole fatigue test {{plays a key role}} in guaranteeing the success of the test and achieving the prescribed goal. The controlling test of landing gears is part of this fatigue test. The main structures under considerations are uplocks and lower locks of main landing gears, uplock of nose landing gear, and actuator <b>cylinder</b> <b>flanges</b> of both gears. By using the combination of trend analysis and correlation analysis of AE parameters, real time monitoring of landing gear condition is realized, and the leak in the actuator and the linkage wearing were successfully predicted. The methods used are straightforward and direct, they can supply fast analysis speed and realize real time monitoring. The work provides a useful reference for AE signal processing in the future fatigue test or for AE monitoring technique used in the same environment of high background noise...|$|R

40|$|The CB- 4 is {{designed}} as a connection point between a Watchman portable data collector and permanently installed transducers. Up to 12 transducers in four locations are supported. Permanently mounted transducers are typically used in places where the technician {{is not able to}} easily access the machine due to safety or other considerations. This application note covers installation and use of the CB- 4 remote sensor connection box. Each terminal strip of the CB- 4 represents a triaxial test location that is identified by the bar-code on the front panel. Setting up the test location in the EAV software is exactly the same as if the test location were accessible. Care must be taken in connecting the wires between the transducers and the CB- 4 to ensure orientation of the three axes are correctly defined in the software. Assembly and Mounting 1.

40|$|An {{extractor}} type ionization gauge {{has been}} developed for <b>flange</b> <b>mounting</b> in a 15. 7 mm diam. aperture. The gauge electrodes are aligned by ceramic plates. A cylindrical anode grid of 9 mm diam. and 12. 5 mm length is formed of photo-etched W-sheet. A thoria coated W-filament is employed made from two semicircular loops mounted outside and concentric with the anode grid. The two halves of the filament are connected in parallel. The height of the electrodes {{from the top of}} the anode grid to the base of the hemispherical collector is 18. 9 mm. The gauge design is a compromise between obtaining a low X-ray or pressure limit, high sensitivity and high electron emission current. The foregoing, given in the same order, were respectively 5 * 10 /sup - 12 / torr; 5 torr/sup - 1 / for N/sub 2 / at 10 mA emission current and 6 torr/sup - 1 / at below 5 mA; and an emission current of between 5 - 10 mA which gave the high anode current density required to maintain a clean grid.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of a new miniature cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) are presented. The CMA comprises outer and inner cylinders, an integral on-axis electron gun, and a detector system consisting of ring aperture and channeltron, all mounted on a single 2. 75 in. (70 mm o. d.) Conflat flange. Entrance angle, sample-to-detector distance, and polar cone angle were chosen, in consideration of second order focusing effects, which optimized analyzer transparency and resolution. Fringe field correction {{at the ends of}} the CMA is made by means of six rings precisely separated by sapphire insulators. The electron gun is a one-lens electrostatic system equipped with an x-y deflector for beam adjustment and scanning. A CeB 6 low temperature cathode operating at up to - 3. 0 keV delivers emission current up to 100 muA. The energy range of analyzed electrons can be varied between 0 eV and 3. 0 keV. The <b>flange</b> <b>mounting</b> also incorporates a high precision z-motion drive for optimization of the working distance. The control electronics and software permit operation of the instrument in pulse and analog phase sensitive detection modes. Results obtained with this new mini CMA for a W(100) surface demonstrate an energy resolution (DeltaE/E) of 0. 9 %, which is comparable to larger 6 in. (152 mm) flange-mounted instruments. The very small size of the mini CMA permits its use in small or crowded ultrahigh vacuum chambers or where only 2. 75 in. ports are available, thereby increasing flexibility in surface analysis.

40|$|Recently, FEP {{developed}} a new family of <b>flange</b> <b>mounted</b> magnetron sources together with pulsed powering and process control. This system can be applied either as single magnetrons powered in unipolar pulse mode, e. g. with a pulsed dc voltage, or can be applied {{as a pair of}} magnetrons powered in bipolar mode, e. g. with an alternating pulsed voltage between both magnetrons that act alternately as the anode and cathode of the discharge. The pulse unit can be switched between the two pulse modes. This allows to investigate directly the influence of the pulse mode and pulse parameters using the same magnetron configuration and the same type of pulse power supply. Experimental results of the reactive deposition of SiO 2, Si 3 N 4 and TiO 2 demonstrate the specifics of both process modes. There are effects of the pulse mode observed for all this materials that are independent on the target material. Furthermore we observed effects of the duty cycle, i. e. the ratio of the pulse-on-time to the cycle time of the rectangular current or voltage pulses. The deposition rate and thermal substrate load exhibit a pronounced dependence on the pulse parameters. The values of film properties like refractive index and internal stress will be discussed for the materials SiO 2, Si 3 N 4 and TiO 2. The flexibility of the pulse sputtering system with free choice of pulse mode allows the universal use either for basic research or in production. The investigations made with this system demonstrate the new possibility to use the pulse parameters to influence film properties...|$|R
