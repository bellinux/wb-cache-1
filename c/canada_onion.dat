The name [...] "wild onion" [...] is applied {{to a number of}} Allium species, but A. cepa is exclusively known from cultivation. Its ancestral wild original form is not known, although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions. The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant, but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season.|$|E

5000|$|News satire {{is also a}} {{very popular}} form of {{contemporary}} satire, appearing in as wide an array of formats as the news media itself: print (e.g. The <b>Onion,</b> <b>Canada</b> News Network, Private Eye), [...] "Not Your Homepage," [...] radio (e.g. On the Hour), television (e.g. The Day Today, The Daily Show, Brass Eye) and the web (e.g. Mindry.in, The Fruit Dish, Scunt News, Faking News, El Koshary Today, The Giant Napkin, Unconfirmed Sources and The Onions website). Other satires are on the list of satirists and satires. Another internet-driven form of satire is to lampoon bad internet performers. An example of this is the Internet meme character Miranda Sings.|$|R
50|$|Montana {{native and}} {{non-native}} peoples {{did not want}} Little Bear and his group in the territory and claimed he was not native to the United States. They demanded that Little Bear and the Ojibwas he led be deported to Canada. For {{the first couple of}} years after returning to their original Montana homeland, many of Little Bear's people roamed throughout the vast Blackfeet reservation. In 1888, the United States reduced the size of the Blackfeet reservation, leaving them with three much smaller reservations. They are the Blackfeet reservation, Fort Belknap reservation, and the Fort Peck reservation. Life got harder for Little Bear and his people, and they often went hungry. In 1895, the United States forced hundreds of landless Cree and Ojibwas of Montana to move to Canada, including Chiefs Little Bear and Lucky Man. They feared the death penalty for their roles in the Frog Lake Massacre. After Little Bear and Lucky Man reached Canada, they were apprehended and one account said they stood trial for their part in the Massacre and were acquitted of the charges, while another said no charges were laid against Little Bear as the magistrate said the evidence did not deem charges. (it is noticeable that Little Bear is listed among the eight Native chiefs hanged on Nov. 27, 1885, so perhaps the government did not want the confusion, or mistaken identity to come out in public.) Little Bear settled in <b>Canada</b> perhaps at <b>Onion</b> Lake and in 1898 travelled, with Rev. John McDougall, to Ottawa to complain of the treatment of his people by the government. He later returned to Montana.|$|R
5000|$|Allium canadense, {{also known}} as <b>Canada</b> <b>onion,</b> Canadian garlic, wild garlic, meadow garlic and wild onion [...] is a {{perennial}} plant native to eastern North America from Texas to Florida to New Brunswick to Montana. The species is also cultivated in other regions as an ornamental and as a garden culinary herb. The plant is also reportedly naturalized in Cuba.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Canada</b> <b>onion</b> is {{cultivated}} as {{a vegetable}} in home gardens in Cuba, scattered locally {{in the south}} to western parts of the island. It was formerly collected from the wild to be eaten by Native Americans and by European settlers. People in the Western Cherokee Nation continue the tradition of picking and cooking wild onions in early spring. Various Native American tribes also used the plant for other purposes: for example, rubbing the plant on the body for protection from insect, lizard, scorpion, and tarantula bites.|$|E
