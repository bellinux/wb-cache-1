5|$|Carrot soup can be {{prepared}} as a cream-style soup and as a broth-style soup. Vegetable stock or <b>chicken</b> <b>stock</b> {{can be used as}} ingredients in both styles of soup. Other vegetables may be used in the dish, including root vegetables, the latter of which may include garlic onion, shallot, potato, turnip and others. Carrot juice and orange juice can be used in its preparation, and some versions are prepared using puréed carrot. After cooking, the dish can be run through a sieve to strain it. The carrots used can be peeled or unpeeled, and the use of peeled carrots can lend to increased smoothness in puréed versions of the dish. Those prepared with puréed carrot may have a thick consistency while also being smooth in texture. The soup's color can vary based upon the coloration of the carrots used. Young carrots tend to make the soup sweeter and imbue it with a bright orange coloration, while older, larger carrots provide less sweetness and may imbue a yellow coloration. The use of old, cracked carrots that have a woody texture in their interior can produce a soup of inferior quality.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chicken</b> <b>stock</b> is {{a liquid}} in which chicken bones and {{vegetables}} have been simmered {{for the purpose}} of serving as an ingredient in more complex dishes. <b>Chicken</b> <b>stock</b> is not usually served as is. Stock can be made with less palatable parts of the chicken, such as feet, necks or bones: the higher bone content in these parts contributes more gelatin to the liquid, making it a better base for sauces.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of stocking density (8, 12 and 16 birds/m 2) on productivity and tonic immobility duration (a measure of fearfulness) of Thai crossbred chickens (n= 900 birds) kept at 100 birds per pen. The results showed that stocking density had no significant (P> 0. 05) effect on body weight, body weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion ratio and mortality of chickens from the wk 2 to 12. When stocking density was increased from 8 birds/m 2 to 16 birds/m 2, tonic immobility (TI) duration of the chickens increased significantly (P< 0. 05). However, the TI duration of chickens at a density of 12 birds/m 2 was not significantly different from those of both the lower and the higher densities. In conclusion, Thai crossbred <b>chickens</b> could be <b>stocked</b> up to 12 birds/m 2 without adverse effect on productivity and welfare when compared to those kept at 8 birds/m 2.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine whether supplementing AminoGut (a commercial dietary supplement containing a mixture of L-glutamine and L-glutamic acid) to broiler <b>chickens</b> <b>stocked</b> at 2 different densities affected performance, physiological stress responses, foot pad dermatitis incidence, and intestinal morphology and microflora. A randomized design in a factorial arrangement with 4 diets [basal diet, basal diet + 0. 5 % AminoGut from d 1 to 21, basal diet + 0. 5 % AminoGut from d 1 to 42, and basal diet + virginiamycin (0. 02 %) for d 1 to 42] and 2 stocking densities [0. 100 m 2 /bird (23 birds/pen; LD) or 0. 067 m 2 /bird (35 birds/pen; HD) ]. Results showed that villi length and crypt depth were not changed by different dietary treatments. However, birds in the HD group had smaller villi (P = 0. 03) compared with those of the LD group. Regardless of diet, HD consistently increased the serum concentrations of ceruloplasmin, α- 1 acid glycoprotein, ovotransferin, and corticosterone (P = 0. 0007), and elevated heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (0. 0005). Neither AminoGut supplementation nor stocking density affected cecal microflora counts. In conclusion, under the conditions of this study, dietary supplementation of AminoGut, irrespective of stocking density, had no beneficial effect on growth performance, intestinal morphology, and physiological adaptive responses of broiler chickens raised under hot and humid tropical conditions. However, AminoGut supplementation from d 1 to 42 was beneficial in reducing mortality rate. Also, the increased serum concentrations {{of a wide range of}} acute phase proteins together with elevated corticosterone and heterophil to lymphocyte ratio suggested that high stocking density induced an acute phase response either indirectly as a result of increased incidence of inflammatory diseases such as foot pad dermatitis or possibly as a direct physiological response to the stress of high stocking density...|$|R
40|$|The {{crossbreeding}} between broiler and kampong chickens {{has been}} performed {{to develop a}} kampong-broiler strain <b>chicken.</b> The <b>chicken</b> <b>stocking</b> condition needs more attention {{as a part of}} animal welfare. This study was performed to identify the relationship between the stocking density and the stress based on Temperature Humidity Index (THI) and the effect of stocking density on meat quality, i. e., physical, microbiological, and organoleptic. Ninety DOCs of Kampong-Broiler (KB) were assigned into a completely randomized design with 3 treatments of stocking density i. e., 8, 10, and 12 birds m- 2. Each treatment was replicated 3 times. The experimental chickens were housed in 9 blocks of housing each with 1 x 1 m 2 size. Data on physical and microbiology of meat qualities were analyzed with analysis of variance and continued with Duncan 2 ̆ 7 s multiple range test. The organoleptic data were analyzed by using Kruskal-Wallis test. The result showed that the stocking density did not significantly affect the physical and hedonic quality of KB chicken 2 ̆ 7 s breast. The stocking densities significantly affected (P< 0. 05) the microbiological variables of breast meat. The average value of THI during maintenance reached 28. 98 ± 1. 25 – 29. 33 ± 1. 32 oC. The higher the animal density the higher the THI value that correlated to the stress condition. However, high stocking density did not affect the physical and hedonic quality of breast meat, thus it can be accepted by the consumers. The higher the stocking density the higher the total plate count, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, without the presence of Salmonella sp. The meat quality of KB chickens raised in the stocking density of 10 birds m- 2 meets the requirement of SNI 01 - 3924 - 2009...|$|R
