5|$|As House Speaker, Gingrich oversaw passage by the House {{of welfare}} reform and a <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax cut in 1997. The poor showing by Republicans in the 1998 Congressional elections, a {{reprimand}} from the House for Gingrich's ethics violation, and pressure from Republican colleagues, resulted in Gingrich's resignation from the speakership on November 6, 1998. He resigned altogether from the House on January 3, 1999.|$|E

Some countries impose this tax as a separate payment because <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> cannot be identified with other types of income by the reason of its nature.

5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E
5|$|In 1997, President Clinton {{signed into}} effect the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which {{included}} the largest <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax cut in U.S. history. Under the act, the profits {{on the sale of}} a personal residence ($500,000 for married couples, $250,000 for singles) were exempted if lived in for at least 2 years over the last 5. (This had previously been limited to a $125,000 once-in-a-lifetime exemption for those over the age of 55.) There were also reductions {{in a number of other}} taxes on investment gains.|$|E
5|$|On August 31, Huntsman made a {{major policy}} announcement, calling for, amongst other things such as more {{aggressive}} action on completing free trade agreements, a tax policy modeled on the Simpson-Bowles plan, specifically: elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax, elimination of taxes on <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> and dividends, elimination of all deductions and credits, in favor of significantly lower general rates, with brackets of 8, 14 and 23 percent, and lowering the general corporate rate from 35 to 25%.|$|E

50|$|If the {{business}} then sells the asset for a gain (that is, {{for more than}} its adjusted cost basis), {{this part of the}} gain is called depreciation recapture. When selling certain real estate, it may be treated as <b>capital</b> <b>gain.</b> When selling equipment, however, depreciation recapture is generally taxed as ordinary income, not <b>capital</b> <b>gain.</b> Further, when selling some kinds of assets, none of the <b>gain</b> qualifies as <b>capital</b> <b>gain.</b>|$|R
5|$|On October 23 Biden {{revealed}} {{his health care}} plan. It called for expanded coverage {{for children and adults}} but stops short of mandates for complete universal coverage. It aimed to encourage wellness and modernization of treatment. Biden stated it would cost between $80billion and $110billion per year. He said it could have been paid with a rollback of tax cuts of the richest 1% bracket, <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> and dividends and the elimination of tax loopholes for hedge fund managers and private equity partners. The plan would also had increased the SCHIP program to include children 300% above the poverty level.|$|E
5|$|The {{sovereign}} {{is subject}} to indirect taxes such as value-added tax, and since 1993 the Queen has paid income tax and <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax on personal income. Parliamentary grants to the Sovereign are not treated as income as they are solely for official expenditure. Republicans estimate that the real cost of the monarchy, including security and potential income not claimed by the state, such as profits from the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall and rent of Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, is £334 million a year.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the session, Rice {{prominently}} {{broke with}} Democrats to oppose the removal of <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax breaks and to oppose granting unemployment benefits to locked-out workers. Rice also sponsored legislation backed by the South Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce to create a hybrid public-private health insurance system to cover all Colorado residents; however, these plans were put on hold after proponents of a single payer health care system advanced their competing proposal in the state legislature.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of his {{business}} career, Romney and his wife had a net worth of between $190 and $250million, including their retirement account, worth between $20 and $100million. Most of that wealth has been held in blind trusts since 2003, some of it offshore. An additional blind trust, valued at $100million in 2012, exists in the name of their children. In 2010, Romney and his wife received about $22million in income, almost all of it from investments such as dividends, <b>capital</b> <b>gains,</b> and carried interest; and they paid about $3million in federal income taxes, for an effective tax rate of 14percent. For the years 1990–2010, their effective federal tax rates were above 13percent with an average rate of about 20percent.|$|E
5|$|At {{the inauguration}} on 9 September 2008, Afghan President Hamid Karzai {{was a guest}} of honour, which was a signal for much closer {{cooperation}} {{between the two nations}} in addressing the tribal insurgency along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. After the election, Zardari promised to approve the constitutional provision that removed the President's power to dismiss Parliament, but public scepticism remained on whether he would actually carry out his promise. His economic competence was questioned after allegations that he had raised grain procurement prices through inflationary subsidies and scrapped the <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax. His first parliamentary speech was overshadowed by 20 September Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing. A few days later, he went to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on his first overseas trip as President.|$|E
5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, but said that that aspect of the plan could not yet be evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|E

5|$|On January 27, 2010, {{the day of}} President Barack Obama's State of the Union address, Ryan reintroduced a {{modified}} version of his Roadmap, H.R. 4529: Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2010. The modified plan would have provided across-the-board tax cuts by reducing income tax rates; eliminating income taxes on <b>capital</b> <b>gains,</b> dividends, and interest; and abolishing the estate tax and Alternative Minimum Tax. The plan would also have replaced the corporate income tax with a border-adjusted business consumption tax of 8.5%. The plan would have privatized a portion of Social Security and reduced benefits for those under 55, eliminated the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance, and privatized Medicare and Medicaid.|$|E
5|$|Ryan {{supports}} {{eliminating the}} <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax, the corporate income tax, the estate tax, and the Alternative Minimum Tax. In 1999, Ryan supported the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed some financial regulation of banks from the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933. During {{the economic recovery}} from the Great Recession of the late 2000s, Ryan supported the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which authorized the Treasury to purchase toxic assets from banks and other financial institutions, and the auto industry bailout; Ryan opposed the Credit CARD Act of 2009, which expanded consumer protections regarding credit card plans, and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which strengthened financial regulation.|$|E
5|$|Tax {{law also}} makes special {{exemptions}} for charitable trusts.

There is no requirement for charitable trusts to pay <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax or council tax, although they are obliged to pay VAT. This freedom from tax liability applies not just to charitable trusts, but also to people who donate to them. Individuals who donate via Gift Aid are free from paying tax on that amount, while companies who give gifts to charity can claim tax on the amount back from HM Revenue & Customs.|$|E

5|$|The {{swearing}} in of Romney as the 70th {{governor of}} Massachusetts {{took place on}} January 2, 2003. He faced a Massachusetts state legislature with large Democratic majorities in both houses, and had picked his cabinet and advisors based more on managerial abilities than partisan affiliation. He declined a governor's salary of $135,000 during his term. Upon entering office {{in the middle of}} a fiscal year, he faced an immediate $650million shortfall and a projected $3billion deficit for the next year. Unexpected revenue of $1.0–1.3billion from a previously enacted <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax increase and $500million in new federal grants decreased the deficit to $1.2–1.5billion. Through a combination of spending cuts, increased fees, and removal of corporate tax loopholes, the state achieved surpluses of around $600–700million during Romney's last two full fiscal years in office, although it began running deficits again after that.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and <b>capital</b> <b>gains.</b> The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E
