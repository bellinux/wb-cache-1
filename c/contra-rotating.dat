5|$|In a follow-up, to meet Specification O.21/44 for a two-seat strike fighter, the Spearfish was {{redesigned}} {{to accommodate}} a twin-coupled Rolls-Royce Merlin engine and <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers. A variety of other engines were considered and although a production order was placed for three examples in 1944, the programme was eventually shelved, remaining as an unfulfilled paper project.|$|E
5|$|In his book, The World's Worst Warships, naval {{historian}} Antony Preston characterised the popovkas like this: But {{in other}} respects, {{they were a}} dismal failure. They were too slow to stem the current in the Dniepr, and proved very difficult to steer. In practice the discharge of even one gun caused them to turn {{out of control and}} even <b>contra-rotating</b> some of six propellers was unable to keep the ship on the correct heading. Nor could they cope with the rough weather which is frequently encountered in the Black Sea. They were prone to rapid rolling and pitching in anything more than a flat calm, and could not aim or load their guns under such circumstances.|$|E
5|$|The Firebrand {{required}} significant {{effort by}} Blackburn {{to produce a}} useful aircraft and the first discussions on a redesign of the aircraft with a laminar-flow wing took place in September 1943. The new wing was estimated to reduce {{the weight of the}} wing by 700lb (318kg) and increase the aircraft speed by 13mph (21km/h). The extent of redesign increased and this led to a new fuselage and other improvements. In October 1943, Blackburn's design staff, led by G.E. Petty, started work on this development of the Firebrand which led to Specification S.28/43 being issued by the Air Ministry on 26 February 1944 covering the new aircraft. The specification was designed around a Bristol Centaurus 77 radial engine with <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers that allowed the size of the rudder to be reduced.|$|E
25|$|Some test Spitfire XIVs, 21s, and 24s were {{fitted with}} <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers, which {{eliminated}} the torque effect. Early {{problems with the}} complex gearbox that was required for <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers prevented them from ever becoming operational in Spitfires, but they were used on later aircraft, including the Seafire FR. Mk 46 and F and FR.47, which were fitted with Griffon 87s driving <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers as standard equipment. The Griffon 57 and 57A series, installed in Universal Power Plant (UPP) installations and driving <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers, {{was used in the}} Avro Shackleton maritime patrol aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The XF-11 used Pratt & Whitney R-4360-31 28-cylinder radial engines. Each engine drove {{a pair of}} <b>contra-rotating</b> four-bladed, controllable-pitch propellers, {{which can}} {{increase}} performance and stability, {{at the cost of}} increased mechanical complexity. Due to constant problems with the <b>contra-rotating</b> propulsion system, the second prototype had regular single four-bladed propellers.|$|E
25|$|A similar <b>contra-rotating</b> {{propeller}} {{unit was}} later used on production Seafire 46 and 47s.|$|E
25|$|Modified {{to drive}} <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers; 2,340hp (1,745kW) at 750ft (230m) and 2,100hp (1,565kW) at 12,250ft (3,740m).|$|E
25|$|Browning hired two Lockheed engineers, Pete Law and Bruce Boland, {{and a team}} {{of other}} specialists made major {{modifications}} to the plane, including installation of a Rolls-Royce Griffon 57 engine and <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers from an Avro Shackleton. The larger engine required significant changes to the airframe, particularly the engine compartment. The <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers also created instability that required an increase in fin area, all of which cost Browning more than $300,000.|$|E
25|$|The Model 100 had {{an unusual}} inboard mounted twin engine {{arrangement}} driving forward mounted <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers through driveshafts.|$|E
25|$|Bossi further {{developed}} helicopter technology, {{particularly with}} regard to <b>contra-rotating</b> dual propellers and tail rotors – work which was also, to a limited degree, furthered by his two sons.|$|E
25|$|A high {{pressure}} ratio along with <b>contra-rotating</b> the IP and HP spools improves efficiency. The use of more legacy components reduces the parts count to minimise maintenance costs. A tiled combustor is featured.|$|E
25|$|Actual {{flight tests}} of the {{aircraft}} revealed several problems: The <b>contra-rotating</b> props caused constant heavy drive-shaft vibration and the government-supplied gearboxes had frequent malfunctions and reduced the effectiveness of propeller control. After only 19 flights, Northrop grounded the first XB-35; the second aircraft was grounded after eight test flights. During this time, the <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers were removed and replaced with four-blade single-rotation propellers. In addition to having continued drive shaft vibration problems, the new single-rotation props greatly reduced the aircraft's speed and performance. Furthermore, the intricate exhaust system turned into a fiasco to maintain. After only two years of use, the engines already showed signs of metal fatigue.|$|E
25|$|Two Ha40 coupled {{together}} with a common gearbox, driving a twin three-blade <b>contra-rotating</b> propeller. Used in the Kawasaki Ki-64. The combination was rated at 2,350 PS (1,728 kW) at sea-level and 2,500 rpm, up to 2,200 PS (1,618 kW) at 2,400 rpm and 3.7 km altitude.|$|E
25|$|The Westland Wyvern was a British single-seat carrier-based {{multi-role}} {{strike aircraft}} built by Westland Aircraft that {{served in the}} 1950s, seeing active service in the 1956 Suez Crisis. Production Wyverns were powered by a turboprop engine driving large and distinctive <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers, and could carry aerial torpedoes.|$|E
25|$|The Douglas XB-42 Mixmaster was an {{experimental}} bomber aircraft, {{designed for a}} high top speed. The unconventional approach was to mount the two engines within the fuselage driving a pair of <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers mounted at the tail in a pusher configuration, leaving the wing and fuselage clean and free of drag-inducing protrusions.|$|E
25|$|The Manzolini Libellula II was an Italian 1950s {{experimental}} helicopter; {{its most}} notable feature {{was a pair}} of <b>contra-rotating</b> coaxial rotors that made the tail rotor unnecessary. Two prototypes were built, the second of which is on display at the museum; they were flown between 1952 and the 1960s. The type did not go into production.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, one Battle, K9370, {{underwent}} extensive {{modifications in}} order to test the Fairey Monarch 2,000+hp (1,490+kW) engine; in addition to the engine itself, K9370 was furnished with electrically-controlled three-bladed <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers and a large ventral radiator. According to Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1946–47, the aircraft was shipped to the U.S.A. after 86 hours test time in December 1941. Testing continued for a time at Wright Airfield, Liberty County, Georgia.|$|E
25|$|The Seagull had an {{all-metal}} construction with a two spar {{parasol wing}} {{mounted on a}} pylon connecting it to the fuselage. The single engine, a Rolls-Royce Griffon drove <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers; radiators were mounted below the engine in the pylon. The rear of the pylon accommodated an observer's position with two windows. An eye bolt was fitted on the wing, behind the engine, so the aircraft could be easily lifted from the water by crane.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to Japanese Shinyo motorboats, MT boats, though very {{dangerous}} {{to use in}} combat, were not designed as suicide weapons: The pilot, installed over the transom had a crude ejector seat and after bailing out, the seat acted as a miniature raft to keep the pilot {{out of the water}} and immune from the lethal shock of the underwater explosion. Another very innovative design was the Isotta-Fraschini Z-drive transmission system, featuring an inboard engine and twin outboard <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} design soon matured {{into the more}} conventional Westland W.34, with the 3,500hp (2,610kW) Eagle engine in the nose driving large <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers and the pilot sitting high in a humped fuselage to improve visibility. The design was otherwise orthodox, with a low wing, tailwheel undercarriage and double-folding wings fitted with both Youngman flaps on the inner wing section and conventional flaps on the outer section. The W.34 was to be armed with four Hispano 20 mm cannon in the wings and {{have the ability to}} carry a torpedo under the fuselage or a selection of bombs and rockets under the wings.|$|E
25|$|Hughes was {{involved}} in another near-fatal aircraft accident on July 7, 1946, while performing the first flight of the prototype U.S. Army Air Forces reconnaissance aircraft, the XF-11, near Hughes airfield at Culver City, California. An oil leak caused one of the <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers to reverse pitch, causing the aircraft to yaw sharply and lose altitude rapidly. Hughes attempted to save the aircraft by landing it at the Los Angeles Country Club golf course, but just seconds before reaching the course, the XF-11 started to drop dramatically and crashed in the Beverly Hills neighborhood surrounding the country club.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, in {{response}} to the issuing of Air Ministry Specification F.13/44, which sought a long-range fighter equipped with the Rolls Royce R.46 engine, Sydney Camm initiated work on a new design, designated as the P.1027. This was essentially a slightly enlarged Tempest which was powered by the R.46 engine, which was projected to develop around 2,500–4,000hp (1,864–2,983kW). This engine would have driven a set of eight-bladed <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers. The radiator was relocated into a ventral bath set underneath the rear fuselage and wing centre section: the wingspan was 41ft (12.5m) and the length was 37ft 3in (11.4m).|$|E
25|$|The PKZ-2 was {{developed}} by Žurovec in parallel with the PKZ-1, but wholly independently. Zurovec acknowledged the support only of Petróczy, although later reports have mistakenly attributed the entire design to Kármán. The aircraft was built by Dr Liptak & Co AG under Žurovek's direction. It had three radiating arms, each housing a rotary piston engine. These engines were coupled together to drive a central pair of co-axial, <b>contra-rotating</b> two-bladed wooden propellers or rotors, of 6m diameter, mounted above the airframe. A round cockpit for the aircrew was fixed centrally, {{on top of the}} rotor mast. Landing gear again comprised rubber-fabric cushions, one large central one and three smaller ones {{at the end of each}} arm.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{arrived at}} Omsk at 0:30 and was refueled with 38 tons of jet fuel. 5 hours after landing, the four engine propfan lifted off the runway {{on its way}} to Yakutsk for cold weather testing. Within seconds of becoming airborne one of the Progress D-27 engines with <b>Contra-rotating</b> propellers reached an over-speed condition and automatically shut down. The forward propeller stopped rotating but {{due to the nature of}} the failure the aft propeller kept turning, producing negative thrust. At this point the flight crew increased power to the remaining three engines but a problem with the RPM sensors on one of them led to automatic engine shut-off. Thus, the An-70 ended up flying at low speed with only two properly functioning engines, with the third engine generating over 11,000 pounds of negative thrust and disrupting airflow across the wing.|$|E
25|$|The Hughes D-2 was {{conceived}} in 1939 as a bomber with five crew members, powered by 42-cylinder Wright R-2160 Tornado engines. In {{the end it}} appeared as two-seat fighter-reconnaissance aircraft designated the D-2A, powered by two Pratt & Whitney R-2800-49 engines. The aircraft was constructed using the Duramold process. The prototype was brought to Harper's Dry Lake California in great secrecy in 1943 and first flew on June 20 of that year. Acting on a recommendation of the president's son, Colonel Elliott Roosevelt, who had become friends with Hughes, in September 1943 the USAAF ordered 100 of a reconnaissance development of the D-2, known as the F-11. Hughes then attempted to get the military {{to pay for the}} development of the D-2. In November 1944, the hangar containing the D-2A was reportedly hit by lightning and the aircraft was destroyed. The D-2 design was abandoned, but led to the extremely controversial Hughes XF-11. The XF-11 was a large all-metal, two-seat reconnaissance aircraft, powered by two Pratt & Whitney R-4360-31 engines, each driving a set of <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers. Only the two prototypes were completed; the second one with a single propeller per side.|$|E
25|$|The first models, known generically as the T300s, {{all used}} a common piston {{diameter}} (76mm) {{in a common}} wet cylinder liner. Basic engine variations were achieved {{through the use of}} two specifications of piston stroke: 65mm to create individual cylinder capacity of 300cc, and 55mm to create a 250cc individual cylinder. Two 750cc models were released – and the Daytona and Trident 750 triples (3 x 250cc). There was one 1000cc model – the Daytona 1000 four (4 x 250cc). Two 900cc models were the Trophy 900 and Trident 900 triples (3 x 300cc). The Trophy 1200 four was the largest model (4 x 300cc). All were remarkably smooth running. The three cylinder models were equipped with a <b>contra-rotating</b> balance shaft mounted {{at the front of the}} engine. The four cylinder models benefitted from twin balance shafts – unique at the time – mounted beneath the crank shaft. Contemporary road tests noted the solidity and smoothness of performance as positives but the weight of the machines as negatives. For brand new machines produced by a totally new concern, there were remarkably few early problems. These were an insecure oil pressure switch and a longer-lived problem with the starter (or sprag clutch). The cosmetic finish on the first machines was simple and not very robust. Revisions to crankcases for the three-cylinder models in 1993, together with a move to high pressure casting, reduced engine weight considerably. All painting and plating operations were brought in house in 1993, as the Hinckley factory benefitted from further investment after the initial success of the range. The result was improved quality and durability of finish, added to the basic engineering integrity of the engine and chassis, made for a long-lasting and robust motorcycle.|$|E
500|$|The {{machine was}} a simple, cross-shaped frame, with the pilot {{standing}} on a platform, secured by a safety harness. The harness also secured the aircraft's engine, which was an outboard motor manufactured by Mercury Marine. The engine was controlled by a twist-grip motorcycle-style throttle and transferred power to the [...] diameter, <b>contra-rotating</b> rotors via belt drive with a chain reduction unit. The aircraft's landing gear consisted of airbags {{at the end of}} each arm of the frame along with a large rubber float in the middle, allowing for amphibious capability, although this arrangement was later replaced by a pair of conventional helicopter-type skids.|$|E
500|$|Over {{a series}} of {{tethered}} and free-flying test flights lasting up to 43 minutes, the HZ-1 suffered a pair of accidents. Both crashes occurred under similar conditions – the <b>contra-rotating</b> rotors intermeshed and collided, the blades shattering, causing an immediate loss of control resulting in a crash. Aerodynamic testing was conducted in the full-scale wind tunnel at the Langley Research Center, and {{it was discovered that}} the Aerocycle's forwards speed was limited by an uncontrollable pitching motion, but rotor-tip clearance was always sufficient. The inability to determine the precise cause of the intermeshing, combined {{with the fact that the}} [...] "personal lifting device" [...] concept was failing to live up to its expectations, led to the decision to terminate the project.|$|E
500|$|The An-70 is a {{monoplane}} with a high-mounted wing {{design that}} features four distinctive propfan engines. Designed by the Progress Design Bureau, {{each of the}} D-27 engines is rated at 13,800shp (which can be uprated to 16,000shp), {{which is used to}} drive the SV-27 [...] <b>contra-rotating</b> scimitar propellers designed by Aerosila; eight on the front propeller and six on the aft propeller. The propfan engines deliver slipstream to the supercritical wings that feature double-slotted trailing edges to provide high lift coefficients at low speeds. The modernisation of the aircraft during 2010–12 saw upgrades to the engines, including the incorporation of FADEC, and the further separation of the two propellers. The aircraft's cruise speed is 750km/h (405kt) at an operational altitude of Antonov claimed in 1997 that the aircraft had a design maximum speed of 850km/h (460kt, or Mach0.8), which would have compared favourably with Mach0.77 of the larger turbofan-powered C-17. According to DASA's evaluation, the propfan engines were 10percent more efficient than conventional turboprops.|$|E
500|$|Work on two prototypes was {{authorised}} in November 1943, but {{proposals for}} alternative engines delayed progress. In 1945, {{it was decided}} that as well as adding another Centaurus-engined prototype, there should be three prototypes with the Napier E.122 (a development of the Sabre) as Specification S.10/45. The Ministry believed that this would enable Blackburn to develop their knowledge of aerodynamic and structural design and support the engine development at Napier. However, {{it was found that the}} S.10/45 aircraft could only be balanced if the E.122 powerplant was placed behind the pilot. The necessary redesign and [...] weight increase, coupled with the limited funds available to the Royal Navy, meant that it could no longer be justified and the S.10/45 was cancelled on 8 October. While in final design, the Centaurus 77 engine with <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers was cancelled in January 1946 and a conventional [...] Centaurus 57 was substituted. This engine was found to require flexible mounts and was modified into the Centaurus 59. The vertical stabiliser and rudder had to be enlarged from [...] to counteract the new engine's torque. In September 1946 a strength analysis conducted by the Ministry of Supply revealed that the aircraft would require strengthening to serve as a strike fighter and that a costly redesign would be required to bring it up to requirements. This would have made it comparable in weight and performance to the Westland Wyvern which had already flown so no contract was placed for production aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Black tea: The {{tea leaves}} {{are allowed to}} {{completely}} oxidize. Black tea is first withered to induce protein breakdown and reduce water content (68-77% of original). The leaves then undergo a process known in the industry as [...] "disruption" [...] or [...] "leaf maceration", which through bruising or cutting disrupts leaf cell structures, releasing the leaf juices and enzymes that activate oxidation. The oxidation process takes between 45–90 minutes to 3 hours and is done at high humidity between 20-30 degrees Celsius, transforming much of the catechins of the leaves into complex tannin. Orthodox processed black teas are further graded according to the post-production leaf quality by the Orange Pekoe system, while crush, tear, curl (CTC) teas use a different grading system. Orthodox tea leaves are heavily rolled either by hand or mechanically on a cylindrical rolling table or a rotorvane. The rolling table consists of a ridged table-top moving in an eccentric manner to a large hopper of tea leaves, of which the leaves are pressed down onto the table-top. The process produces a mixture of whole and broken leaves, and particles which are then sorted, oxidized, and dried. The rotovane consisted of an auger pushing withered tea leaves through a vane cylinder [...] which crushes and evenly cuts the leaves. Crush, tear, curl is a production method developed by William McKercher in 1930 which uses machines with <b>contra-rotating</b> rotors with surfaces patterning that cut and tear the leaves producing a product popular for use in tea bags. The rotovane to often use to precut the withered tea prior to the CTC and to create broken orthodox processed black tea.|$|E
