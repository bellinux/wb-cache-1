Then, the two suspensions were mixed under ultrasonification, according to the weight ratio of CFO versus polymer, and spin-coated or cast-coated on Si or glass substrates and dried at 90 °C under vacuum. The thickness of the obtained thin films (200 nm to 1.6 μm) was controlled by the times and/or rotation speed (300 to 1000 rpm) of the spin coating. To measure film thickness, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) cross-sectional analysis was applied. The Si substrate was scored and cut/fractured in order to observe film cross sections, which were then easily analyzed by SEM. Correct instrumental calibration and review of the film over several regions confirmed thin film uniformity, expected for spin/cast coating, and thicknesses could be determined to within ± 7 %. For dielectric measurements, the glass substrates were pre-deposited with rectangular (1 mm × 5 mm) Ag bottom electrodes by a thermal evaporator. Top electrodes were deposited (5 mm × 1 mm) after the films were coated and dried, leaving the composite sandwiched between two electrodes with square crossed area of 1 mm × 1 mm.|$|E

Here, a series of 0 – 3 type nanocomposite thin films composed of ferrimagnetic cobalt ferrite nanocrystals (8 to 18 nm) and a ferroelectric/piezoelectric polymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene), P(VDF-HFP), were prepared by multiple spin coating and <b>cast</b> <b>coating</b> over a thickness range of 200 nm to 1.6 μm.

The CoFe 2 O 4 polymer nanocomposite thin films exhibit composition-dependent effective permittivity, loss tangent, and specific saturation magnetization (Ms). An enhancement of the effective permittivity and saturation magnetization of the CoFe 2 O 4 -P(VDF-HFP) films was observed and directly compared with CoFe 2 O 4 -polyvinylpyrrolidone, a non-ferroelectric polymer-based nanocomposite prepared by the same method. The comparison provided evidence for the observation of a magnetoelectric effect in the case of CoFe 2 O 4 -P(VDF-HFP), attributed to a magnetostrictive/piezoelectric interaction.

40|$|Corrosion {{is a major}} {{environmental}} and economic problem with many modern manmade structures heavily relying on the utilisation of metals and alloys due to their extraordinary strength, mechanical and physical properties. Applications such as those seen in the construction industry, aerospace and marine industries, all of which need a constant protection and barriers against the harsh environmental conditions. Current methods of protection employ the use of chromates in paint formulations for the active anti-corrosive paints or the uses of non-active polymeric paints acting solely as a physical barrier preventing the diffusion of ions through to the metal surface. However ideas have recently come forward {{regarding the use of}} conductive and electro-active polymers. Theorised to not only prevent the diffusions of ions on a physical level but to also act as an electrochemical barrier by passivating the surface of the metal so that it can protect itself from further degradation caused by corrosive agents, one such polymer that has been put forward is Polyaniline (PANI). Through the process of doping, PANI can be made to conduct an electrical current through the formation of charge carriers by oxidising the PANI with a protonic acid which can be functionalised. Further investigation has found that the functionalisation of these acids can dramatically change the once insoluble material in common solvents soluble, increasing the processability and possible increase the applications of this materials. This thesis reports the synthetic routes used to obtain functionalised Sulphonic acids based on the precursor 5 -Sulphoisophthalic acid by acid catalysed esterification’s are described. With the synthesis phosphoric acid diester carried out by several named reported methods and both series were progressed forward to dope PANI (polyaniline). The optical properties were analysed for all doped PANI in DCM showing that branched side chains produced the highest optical absorption at around 944 nm and some as thin films (21) and (25), showing optical band gaps of 1. 21 eV. This thesis also reports the anti-corrosions properties for the doped PANI systems. Films were <b>cast</b> <b>coating</b> mild carbon steel and copper plates, along with a range of acrylic resin/doped PANI composite films, PVC/doped PANI composite films and a set of films for an epoxide resin/doped PANI (17) composite. Samples were subjected to accelerated corrosion tests and showed that the application of PANI to the metal surfaces was beneficial and displayed efficacious anti-corrosion properties, not only in the doped state (emeraldine salt) but also in its native undoped state (emeraldine base) where the polymer undergoes redox reactions at the metal interface passivating the surface and creating an electrochemical barrier system which the polymer itself is a component however corrosion inhibition is only truly effective when a physical barrier is used in combination. The results of the dopant synthesis, doped PANI systems and their composites in resins and the data from NMR spectroscopy, IR, elemental analysis, LC-Mass spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy are presented in this thesis. The accelerated corrosion tests and the data from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are also presented within this thesis. ...|$|E

40|$|Although cementless knee {{arthroplasty}} is {{a commonly}} performed procedure, to date very little {{was known about}} the process of osseointegration of knee arthroplasty components. Using a knee prosthesis that was specially designed for the sheep stifle joint, this process of osseointegration could be studied in vivo, together with its effects on clinical and functional performance, its influence on mechanical fixation, and its influence on component stability or migration over time. Additionally, the osseointegration capacity of a newly developed <b>cast</b> mesh porous <b>coating</b> could be examined. The rationale for this newly developed coating was to provide a surface texture with theoretically superior osseointegration capacity, by offering a larger and better controlled pore size, with higher ingrowth area compared to conventional bead type coatings. In summary, the conclusions that are drawn from this work are the following: 1. The degree of osseointegration of knee arthroplasty components is not correlated with clinical and functional performance. Knee arthroplasty components with fibrous integration can function as well as osseointegrated components at least during the first years after implantation. This explains the occasional reports in the literature of post mortem retrieved, well functioning knee arthroplasty components, with purely fibrous integration on histomorphometric analysis. 2. Fibrous integration of tibial knee arthroplasty components, however, leads to less mechanical fixation strength of these components. Osseointegrated components are much more strongly fixed to the underlying bone. This difference in mechanical fixation strength is detectable under physiologic loads. 3. Fibrous integration of tibial knee arthroplasty components leads to increased migration, becoming apparent after 1 year with radiostereometric analysis (RSA). Osseointegrated components are significantly more stable over time. 4. Fibrous integration is less desirable, since it leads to mechanically less rigidly fixed implants, and subsequently to migration over time. On the long-term, fibrous integration might therefore lead to loosening. 5. RSA is an effective tool to assess migration of knee arthroplasty components. The RSA migration of an uncemented component is also an indicator of its degree of osseointegration and its mechanical fixation strength, since RSA migration is correlated with these two parameters. RSA is therefore especially useful during the first postoperative years, since increased migration indicates fibrous integration and low mechanical fixation strength, suggesting an increased risk for subsequent loosening at a later stage. Patients with increased early component migration on RSA might therefore be advised to impose specific restrictions on their knee arthroplasty. 6. Osseointegration is not routinely achieved in conventional porous coated tibial knee arthroplasty components. The development of a theoretically superior <b>cast</b> mesh <b>coating</b> did not lead to a significantly higher degree of osseointegration. It is suggested that the lack of sufficiently small interface gaps and the lack of sufficiently small interface micromotion [...] two known prerequisites for reliable osseointegration to occur [...] are the main reasons inhibiting osseointegration, both in this animal model and in the human situation. 7. Significant osseointegration, however, does occur in the newly developed <b>cast</b> mesh <b>coated</b> components, when they are additionally coated with a vacuum plasma sprayed 50 microns hydroxyapatite layer. The newly developed <b>cast</b> mesh <b>coating</b> is ideally suited for such an additional hydroxyapatite coating. Remarkably high percentages of both bone ingrowth and ongrowth can be seen with these hydroxyapatite <b>coated</b> <b>cast</b> mesh coatings, higher than so far reported for current tibial knee arthroplasty components. These osseointegrated hydroxyapatite <b>coated</b> <b>cast</b> mesh components show significantly higher mechanical fixation strength and lower RSA migration. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Molten metal droplet {{impingement}} is {{an integral}} part of droplet based manufacturing processes like spray <b>casting</b> and sprays <b>coating.</b> In these processes, in a single operation, a liquid metal stream is atomized into fine droplets, which impact on a substrate to form a bulk deposit. The properties of <b>casting</b> or <b>coating</b> strongly depend on the shape of splats formed by individual droplets after impingement and solidification. Therefore, considerable research studies have been carried out to characterize individual droplet impact, usually driven by an interest in a particular process. These studies include extensive modeling of droplet deposition, some of which are supported by experimental studies. Most of these modeling activities have focused on the impingement of a droplet on to a surface to predict quantities such as the extent of maximum spread and the final equilibrium diameter, the rate of heat transfer to the substrate, and the solidification rate. Due to interaction of several complex phenomena, comprehensive modeling of the droplet deposition is a challenging task. The flow of liquid droplet upon impingement is itself a complex phenomenon. Heat transfer and solidification occurring concurrently with the flow adds further to the complexity. Thus the present study aims at the development of a comprehensive mathematical model of impingement of liquid metal droplet upon a substrate to understand the effect of process parameters such as initial temperature of droplet, size of droplet and velocity of droplet...|$|R
