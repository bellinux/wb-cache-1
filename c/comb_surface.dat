50|$|There is dispute among players {{about whether}} comb {{material}} affects {{the tone of}} a harmonica. Those saying no argue that, unlike the soundboard of a piano or the top piece of a violin or guitar, a harmonica's comb is neither large enough nor able to vibrate freely enough to substantially augment or change the sound. Among those saying yes {{are those who are}} convinced by their ears. Few dispute, however, that <b>comb</b> <b>surface</b> smoothness and air-tightness when mated with the reedplates can greatly affect tone and playability. The main advantage of a particular comb material over another one is its durability. In particular, a wooden comb can absorb moisture from the player's breath and contact with the tongue. This can cause the comb to expand slightly, making the instrument uncomfortable to play, and to then contract, potentially compromising air tightness. Various types of wood and treatments have been devised to reduce the degree of this problem.|$|E

The straight portion of this course, called a waggle-run, consists of a single stride (Tautz et al., 1996) emphasized by lateral waggling motions of the abdomen. The length of the individual waggle-runs increases with the distance flown to reach the source (von Frisch and Jander, 1957; von Frisch, 1965), and their angles relative to gravity correlate with the direction of the foraging flights relative to the sun’s azimuth in the field and sun-linked patterns of polarized skylight (von Frisch, 1965). Thus, by encoding the visually measured distance (Esch and Burns, 1995, 2001; Srinivasan et al., 2000; Tautz et al., 2004) and the direction towards the goal (Lindauer, 1963; von Frisch, 1965; Gould and Gould, 1988), the waggle dance allows colony members to share information about the location of desirable food sources (von Frisch, 1965; Seeley, 1995; Dyer, 2002). Moreover, based on these correlations, the waggle dance also allows analysis of internal representations of space (Lindauer...|$|E
40|$|Honeybee larvae and pupae are {{extremely}} stenothermic, i. e. they strongly depend on accurate regulation of brood nest temperature for proper development (33 – 36 °C). Here we study {{the mechanisms of}} social thermoregulation of honeybee colonies under changing environmental temperatures concerning the contribution of individuals to colony temperature homeostasis. Beside migration activity within the nest, the main active process is “endothermy on demand” of adults. An increase of cold stress (cooling of the colony) increases the intensity of heat production with thoracic flight muscles {{and the number of}} endothermic individuals, especially in the brood nest. As endothermy means hard work for bees, this eases much burden of nestmates which can stay ectothermic. Concerning the active reaction to cold stress by endothermy, age polyethism is reduced to only two physiologically predetermined task divisions, 0 to ∼ 2 days and older. Endothermic heat production is the job of bees older than about two days. They are all similarly engaged in active heat production both in intensity and frequency. Their active heat production has an important reinforcement effect on passive heat production of the many ectothermic bees and of the brood. Ectothermy is most frequent in young bees (<∼ 2 days) both outside and inside of brood nest cells. We suggest young bees visit warm brood nest cells not only to clean them but also to speed up flight muscle development for proper endothermy and foraging later in their life. Young bees inside brood nest cells mostly receive heat from the surrounding cell wall during cold stress, whereas older bees predominantly transfer heat from the thorax to the cell wall. Endothermic bees regulate brood comb temperature more accurately than local air temperature. They apply the heat as close to the brood as possible: workers heating cells from within have a higher probability of endothermy than those on the <b>comb</b> <b>surface.</b> The findings show that thermal homeostasis of honeybee colonies is achieved by a combination of active and passive processes. The differential individual endothermic and behavioral reactions sum up to an integrated action of the honeybee colony as a superorganism...|$|E

40|$|Previous work by Moss et al. (2001) {{reported}} surface associated protists on the ctenophore Mnemiopsis sp. They frequently {{observed the}} ciliate Trichodina ctenophorii and a Flabellula-like amoeba {{attached to the}} comb plate surface. They noted that the ciliate and the amoeba {{were found on the}} subsagittal, subtentacular, and the auricular comb plates. The amoeba had a maximum width of about 15 μm and cells were crescent shaped. Ultrastructural evidence suggested that these protists were parasites although the exact nature of the association remained to be determined. This was the background for the present study. The present investigation documented the frequency of occurrence of gymnamoebae on ctenophores around Florida to assess the universality of this association. In addition, the study estimated the number of Flabellula-like comb plate amoebae per <b>comb</b> <b>surface.</b> The study also set out to isolate all surface associated amoebae, including the Flabellula-like amoeba ‘symbiont’, using a variety of media formulations. The goal was to provide material to facilitate the identification and characterization of this amoeba. Over the 2 year duration of the project, 140 Mnemiopsis sp. were collected from 16 locations around Florida and surface tissue was processed for attached gymnamoebae. Eleven morphotypes of amoebae were isolated from 52 of the 140 Mnemiopsis sp. The Flabellula-like gymnamoeba was present on 85 % of the specimens, and the greatest concentration on Florida ctenophores was 946 amoebae mm- 2 of comb plate surface. One isolated amoeba closely resembled the Flabellula-like amoeba described by Moss et al. (2001). It {{is interesting to note that}} although most ctenophores harbored the ‘symbiont’ it was only isolated into culture 2 % of the time. No geographic factors appeared to favor the presence of amoebae on ctenophores. The shortest generation time (ie. fastest growth) calculated for the flabellulid amoeba was 20. 9 hours at a salinity of 10 ppt and a temperature of 23 °C. The amoeba grew best in seawater supplemented with malt/yeast extract to stimulate the growth of attendant prey bacteria. The results suggest that this amoeba, which was numerous on the surface, was predisposed to life on the ctenophore surface and could only be switched to laboratory conditions with difficulty. The amoeba had an unusual stage in the life cycle forming large fused, multinucleate cells in old cultures. This, together with its unique appearance (not resembling any published species) and the problems in amplifying its DNA by PCR (encountered by collaborators at Wood’s Hole Oceanographic Center) suggest that it an interesting amoeba new to science...|$|E
40|$|Water {{filtration}} processes employing polymer membranes {{have become}} increasingly important over the past forty years. Due to their high efficiency and modularity relative to conventional processes, membrane separations are among a suite of emerging water treatment technologies which will make possible future water use sustainability, by enabling the decentralization of wastewater treatment and the recycling of currently unused wastewater streams. The application of these highly efficient processes is presently limited, however, by their high -operating costs relative to conventional processes, the most important cause of which is low fluxes and membrane failure due to fouling of the hydrophobic membrane materials by organics pervasive in feed waters. Current approaches to abate membrane fouling include substitution of more hydrophilic materials, as well as hydrophilic surface modification of hydrophobic membranes using coating and surface graft polymerization techniques. In many applications, the first approach results in unacceptable compromises in mechanical, thermal, and chemical stability. Coating and grafting techniques {{have been successful in}} reducing membrane fouling, but suffer from the disadvantages that (1) they require additional processing steps during membrane fabrication, increasing capital costs, (2) the coated or grafted layers obstruct membrane pores, reducing permeability, and (3) the hydrophilic surface layers have limited long-term stability. This thesis explores the preparation of membranes having tailored surface chemistries from polymer blends composed of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF, an important commercial hydrophobic membrane material) and a small proportion (5 - 10 %) of an amphiphilic, comb shaped additive polymer designed for compatibility with PVDF. These blends self-organize during the aqueous coagulation and heat treatment steps of the standard immersion precipitation process for membrane fabrication, such that the amphiphilic polymer component is localized preferentially at the surface. The near-surface compositions of self-organizing membranes are quantified at the molecular level by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the surface chemistries so determined are related to membrane performance in a variety of adsorption, filtration, and wetting tests. The effect of the amphiphilic additive on membrane morphology is studied using electron microscopy. Much of the work presented herein centers on blends containing an inexpensive, free-radically synthesized comb additive designed for fouling resistance, P(MMA-r-POEM), which has a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) backbone and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) side chains. Using this additive, processing conditions and molecular architecture are optimized {{to take full advantage of}} surface segregation during the conventional steps of the commercial membrane fabrication process. Significant surface segregation is observed to occur during both the coagulation and aqueous heat treatment steps of the process. Using a coagulation bath heated to 90 °C, a near-surface composition of - 50 vol % comb (approaching 100 % surface monolayer coverage) is obtained on a membrane with a bulk comb concentration of 15 vol % (10 wt %), requiring no post-coagulation processing. In an ultrafiltration experiment, membranes prepared using this single-step process exhibit fouling resistances comparable to membranes hydrophilized using coating and grafting methods. Significantly, addition of the comb results in an increase in the membrane porosity of up to an order of magnitude, compared to unmodified membranes having similar pore size distributions. Thus, due to the combined benefits of fouling resistance and increased porosity, a membrane containing 10 wt % of a comb having 45 -unit PEO side chains has a flux over 20 times that of an unmodified PVDF membrane with equivalent separation characteristics after 3 h of filtration of a concentrated protein foulant solution. It is predicted and observed that the kinetics of membrane coagulation favor the surface segregation of higher molecular weight additives. Thus, the near-surface concentration of P(MMA-r-POEM) after coagulation increases monotonically with its molecular weight up to at least M, = 516 000 g/mol, based on polystyrene standards. This enables the preparation of membranes having robust, highly entangled surface layers composed of a water-insoluble <b>comb.</b> <b>Surface</b> layers prepared by self-organization are shown to be completely stable over at least 32 mo. of aqueous storage. Self-organization is shown to have significant advantages over the current surface modification methods. First, self-organization results in surface modification of all internal pore channels, in addition to the external surfaces modified by coating and line-of-site grafting techniques. This has important consequences with respect to fouling by through-pore foulants, as well as the use of immersion precipitation for the facile preparation of advanced devices having tailored surfaces, including filters for toxic metal recovery and scaffolds and barrier. materials for biomedical applications. Second, self-organizing membranes containing P(MMA-r-POEM) are potentially self-healing, in that surface layers damaged by acid exposure can be largely regenerated by subsequent heat treatment in water, which results in further surface segregation of residual comb from the bulk. Using a novel, industrially-relevant atom transfer radical polymerization technique, comb polymers having PVDF backbones and POEM or poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) side chains are prepared. PVDF membranes prepared in a single step from blends containing > 5 wt % PVDF-g- POEM are spontaneously wettable by water. Similarly prepared membranes containing 10 wt % PVDF-g-PMAA are environmentally-responsive, in that the pores can be reversibly opened and closed by adjustment of the feed solution pH, which controls the conformation of the weak polyacid PMAA side chains expressed at the membrane surface. A reversible flux variation of over an order of magnitude is observed as the feed pH is changed from 2 to 8. Conformational changes of surface-expressed PMAA are confirmed by atomic force microscopy force-distance measurements. These results make "intelligent," environmentally responsive filtration membranes available with no extra processing steps, and demonstrate the versatility of self organization as a technique for imparting highly tailored surfaces to polymer membranes. by Jonathan F.

40|$|The {{throughput}} {{and efficiency}} of membrane separations make polymer filtration membranes an important resource for the pharmaceutical, food and wastewater treatment industries. Nanofiltration (NF) membranes fill an important niche between nonporous reverse osmosis membranes, which have comprehensive solute rejection and low solvent permeability, and porous sieving ultrafiltration membranes. However, challenges in NF membrane design remain outstanding. At the effective pore size of NF membranes (~ 0. 5 nm- 2 nm), both electrostatic and steric factors determine membrane selectivity. Most NF membranes are charged under {{a wide range of}} environmental conditions and thus preferentially exclude charged solutes. This charge selectivity precludes separation of molecules based solely on size. An additional limitation of NF membranes is the tendency to foul by adsorption of feed components. The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate control of membrane selectivity in fouling resistant membranes via manipulation of the chemistry of a specific copolymer system, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) -based poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) graft polymers. Previous work with amphiphilic graft copolymers as membrane materials has included PANg- PEO with an average graft length of 9 (PAN-g-PEO 9). PAN-g-PEO 9 was shown to have excellent fouling resistance as an antifouling additive in porous ultrafiltration membranes and as a dense selective layer coated onto a support base membrane-a thin-film composite (TFC) NF membrane. The comb morphology of the polymer imposes high interfacial area on the microphase-separated domains, resulting in a bicontinuous structure consisting of a glassy PAN matrix interpenetrated by PEO-filled "nanochannels" that can act as vias for water and small solutes (with a size cutoff of ~ 0. 8 nm). It also presents a PEO brush on the <b>comb</b> <b>surface</b> which acts as a steric barrier to resist irreversible fouling of the membranes. The understanding from previous work on PEO comb NF membranes is that the pore size is determined by the nanochannel's size, i. e. the PEO domain size. Because the graft characteristics (spacing and length) of comb copolymers determine the domain size, it was expected that varying the graft length would allow broad, precise control of the size cutoff of the TFC membranes, a concept demonstrated previously with amphiphilic graft copolymer NF membranes of poly(vinylidene fluoride) -graft-poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) (PVDF-g-POEM). The first aim of this thesis was to tailor the retention properties of PAN-g-PEO TFC NF membranes by modifying the chemistry to tune the electrostatic and steric properties sufficiently to enable complex separations, particularly of solutes with high fouling potential. Comb copolymers incorporating ~ 40 weight % PEO with side chains varying from 5 - 40 EO units were synthesized by free radical methods and compared as selective-layer coatings on PAN UF membranes. 3 Membranes incorporating combs with 9 EO units or more were shown to resist irreversible fouling when challenged by a model protein feed solution (bovine serum albumin) for 24 hours. Fouling resistance was found to be compromised, however, upon exposure to acid (pH 2) solution, used to simulate chemical cleaning procedures in industry. Thickness-normalized permeabilities of these PAN-g-PEOn NF membranes exceeded those of commercially available NF membranes by approximately an order of magnitude. A systematic effect of side chain length on permeability was seen when varying temperature, ionic strength, and pressure. Contrary to expectations, the membrane size cutoff (~ 0. 8 nm) for charged rigid molecular probes in deionized water was independent of the comb side chain length. This new finding can be explained by modeling the hydrophilic domains as opposing swollen polymer brushes of uniform density acting as a physical gel. The gel mesh size (distance between chains) is independent of side chain length, and controls the size cutoff in good solvent conditions matching those in which the membrane was equilibrated during fabrication. In poorer solvent conditions, a decrease in the brush height, progressing to complete collapse of the PEO gel, can be expected to create differentiation based on domain size (i. e. side chain length). This is consistent with the finding that retentions of dyes increased with decreasing side chain length in saline solution, as salt is known to reduce PEO-water miscibility. Fluorescently labeled peptides germane to proteomics research were filtered and both chromatographic and size-selective membrane behavior was observed-the first demonstration of size-based nanofiltration of peptides. Based on this finding, two different peptides of molecular weights 1. 3 kDa and 1. 5 kDa were fractionated to achieve a six-fold increase in the concentration of the larger peptide relative to the smaller peptide in two filtration steps. The electrostatic selectivity of the PEO comb membranes could also be varied. Terpolymers consisting of PAN-g-PEO with 1 - 2 % charged sulfopropyl acrylate (SPA) or 5 % N,Ndimethyl- N-(2 -methacryloyloxyethyl-N-(3 -sulfopropyl) ammonium betaine (SPE) were synthesized and coated onto PAN base membrane. The divalent salt (Na 2 SO 4) retention of the resulting TFC membranes increased from ~ 20 % for the PAN-g-PEO copolymer to ~ 45 % and 82 % for the SPE and SPA terpolymers, respectively. Retention of monovalent NaCl was substantially lower, characteristic of commercial NF membranes. The charged comb membranes did not completely resist fouling by a 1 g/L BSA solution, losing 2 % of the initial flux after 24 h exposure. Forming a trilayer TFC, with a layer of PAN-g-PEO coated over a charged terpolymer, reduced membrane fouling compared to the charged layer alone. In summary, the goal {{of this study was to}} demonstrate control of membrane selectivity in fouling-resistant PAN-g-PEO NF membranes. An important finding was that the PEO gel created in the hydrophilic domains leads to similar size cutoffs over a wide range of side chain length. To access the desired spectrum of size cutoffs, the quality of solvent for the swollen PEO brush must be reduced. In spite of these limitations, the membrane was shown to have useful fractionating properties as demonstrated with labeled peptides of varying molecular weight. The retention of salts was enhanced by incorporating small amounts of charged monomer into the comb backbone, but at the expense of fouling resistance. by Nathan Gary Lovell. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Here in part 2, we examine surface segregation of these peptide-modified and unmodified comb polymers blended with polylactide (PLA) as a self-assembly approach suitable for surface modification of porous tissue engineering scaffolds. Multiple thermodynamic driving forces for surface enrichment of the comb polymer are exploited by annealing PLA/P(MMA-r-POEM) blends above the glass transition of the blend components but below the melting point of PLA, while in contact with water. Predictions of the interfacial composition profiles of annealed blends were made using a self-consistent field (SCF) lattice model. The calculations predict strong enrichment of the comb in the top 50 Å of blends, and organization of comb molecules in quasi- 2 D conformations at the interface, similar to the apparent structure of pure <b>comb</b> <b>surfaces</b> in contact with water described in part 1.

This polymer has the unique properties of being cell resistant and chemically versatile such that various cell ligands can be coupled to its side chains. These properties allow adhesion through specific cell receptors to be studied without the effect of background adhesion to adsorbed proteins. By taking advantage of the ability to target specific receptors the comb polymer {{could be used as a}} powerful sorting tool. Sorting could be accomplished by finding cell type specific adhesion ligands. Several possible such ligands were screened. A ligand containing the tripeptide sequence RGD was found to elicit a strong cell adhesion response. However, this ligand is adherent to many cell types of the liver and would not be suitable for sorting purposes. Other cell type specific ligands tested showed little to no affinity for liver cell adhesion. Additionally, the comb was utilized to study α₅β₁ integrin-specific hepatocyte adhesion and the effect of Epidermal Growth Factor on adhesion. α₅β₁ integrin adhesion was mediated using a novel branched peptide, SynKRGD. This peptide consists of a linear peptide sequence containing RGDSP and the synergy site sequence PHSRN connected by the sequence GGKGGG.

At times he <b>combed</b> the <b>surface</b> with his fingers, raking out handfuls of gravel. The contents of the pan diminished. As it drew near to the bottom, {{for the purpose of}} fleeting and tentative examination, he gave the pan a sudden sloshing movement, emptying it of water. And the whole bottom showed as if covered with butter. Thus the yellow gold flashed up as the muddy water was flirted away. It was gold--gold-dust, coarse gold, nuggets, large nuggets. He was all alone. He set the pan down for a moment and thought long thoughts. Then he finished the washing, and weighed the result in his scales. At the rate of sixteen dollars to the ounce, the pan had contained seven hundred and odd dollars. It was beyond anything that even he had dreamed. His fondest anticipation's had gone no farther than twenty or thirty thousand dollars to a claim; but here were claims worth half a million each at the least, even if they were spotted.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the war in 1918 the Gasplatz held about 48,000 tonnes of {{chemical}} munitions, several thousand tonnes {{of chemical}}ly-filled captured munitions and 40 tank wagons of unfilled chemicals. These supplies were sunk in the North Sea and the Baltic. During the preparations for this there was a tragic accident on 24 October 1919. A train laden with chemical weapons and munitions exploded. Apart from the Clarkwerk factory and the power station almost the entire facility was destroyed, a total of 42 buildings. Chemical grenades were catapulted for miles around and clouds of poison gas threatened the surrounding villages, some having to be evacuated. Many houses in the surrounding area were badly damaged. In addition to the immediate victims of the explosion there were numerous deaths in the months that followed. The terrain was supposed to be cleared by 1925. Roughly 1,000 workers <b>combed</b> the <b>surface</b> of the land out to a radius of 3 km from the explosion site. There was no detection equipment at that time. A considerable quantity of chemical munitions remained live. In 1921 the Hamburg firm of Stolzenberg took over the work that had been previously carried out by König and Evaporator AG. Stolzenberg established a chemical incineration facility and a site to convert chlorine gas and diphosgene. The latter installation exploded on being taken into service in April 1922. In spite of everything, clearance work was completed in 1925 and the remaining facilities were blown up at the behest of the Allies.|$|R
40|$|On this poster, {{we present}} results from our ongoing {{research}} toward creating a proto-type of a bio-sensor that can detect cancer antigens in human saliva. A simple comb {{printed circuit board}} was designed and manufactured(Fig 1). The bare comb circuit is normally open and requires a conductive substance to fill in between {{the teeth of the}} comb to complete the circuit. We used graphene as the conductive material. The graphene acted as a soft electrical conductor completing the current path across the comb printed circuit board and created an electrical circuit with a unique current, voltage and resistance. We applied various concentrations of graphene to the <b>comb</b> circuit <b>surface</b> and explored graphene’s properties as a soft conductor. Next, a solution containing Poly-Vinyl Alcohol and Sericin Bombyx mori silk solution was electro-spun onto the circuit board creating a sticky cob-web-like covering over the comb circuit. This fabric acted as a resistor on the comb circuit and creates a sticky surface to which target cancer antibodies can be attached. Once the target cancer antibodies are attached to the circuit surface, a bio-sensing platform will be created to detect cancer antigens in fluid. When exposed to a fluid sample such as saliva that contains the complimentary cancer antigen to the antibody, the antibodies and antigens will spontaneously bind. This bound antibody/antigen structure will change the impedance of the electrical circuit. This change in impedance can then be detected, quantified and correlated to antigen concentrations in the saliva sample. Further research can then be done to correlate the impedance readings to dangerous cancer antigen concentrations in the human body...|$|R
40|$|The MilliF {{bioreactor}} offers {{great potential}} {{for the formation of}} i vivo-like liver tissue outside the body, making it a valuable tool for applications such as drug toxicity models and biosensors. Cell adhesion {{is an important factor in}} the maintenance of differentiated hepatocyte functions. Hepatocyte adhesion environments were examined in two settings: spheroid culture prior to seeding in the bioreactor and 2 D surface culture methods that could be applied to the bioreactor scaffold. Spheroids were formed either by culturing in spinning suspension or on a static, non-adherent surface. In spheroid culture, the addition of extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling through the use of soluble Matrigel or adhesion protein-coated microspheres did not improve hepatocyte viability or function as assessed by liver-specific gene expression. These results suggest the importance of cell-cell rather than cell-surface interactions in maintaining hepatocytes. Optimal culturing of spheroids in spinning suspension without the ECM addition was found to be 3 days without media changes. 2 D surfaces were treated with an adhesion peptide-conjugated comb polymer, preventing nonspecific cell adhesion and allowing attachment through the [alpha]₅[beta]₁ integrin. (cont.) Varying the proportion of adhesion peptide presented to cells was found to regulate hepatocyte morphology and function; a surface with decreased hepatocyte spreading and liver-specific gene expression closer to in vivo was characterized. Immunoblotting for activated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) revealed that FAK signaling was not induced by attachment to the <b>comb</b> polymer <b>surfaces.</b> Immunostaining for other liver cell types demonstrated that the surface allowed hepatic stellate cell and Kupffer cell adhesion. by Michael B.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for creating microscopic patterns of stretched and oriented molecules of DNA on a <b>surface.</b> <b>Combing</b> of molecules in microchannels (COMMIC), a {{process by which}} molecules are deposited and stretched onto a surface by the passage of an air−water interface, creates these patterns. This approach demonstrates that the direction of stretching of the molecules is always perpendicular to the air−water interface; the shape and motion of this interface serve as an effective local field directing the chains dynamically as they are stretched onto the surface. The geometry of the microchannel directs {{the placement of the}} DNA molecules, while the geometry of the air− water interface directs the local orientation and curvature of the molecules. This ability to control both the placement and orientation of chains has implication for the use of COMMIC in genetic analysis and in the bottom-up approach to nanofabrication. Introduction. The “bottom-up ” approach to the fabrication of nanoscale systems starts with the controlled deposition of molecules or nanoscale objects (such as rods, wires, or tubes) on a surface; 1 these objects serve as templates that direct the deposition of additional molecules or materials...|$|R
40|$|The thesis uses {{experiments}} and simulations {{to examine the}} interactions of DNA molecules with proteins and protein-like nanoparticles, with applications to protein search and targeting of DNA sequences, and to DNA complexation in chromatin and for gene delivery. Two topics are covered in depth. In the first topic, kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, one dimensional reaction-diffusion equations, and analytical methods are used to determine rate at which DNA-binding proteins (e. g. transcription factors) can find the target sequences in long DNA molecules {{through a combination of}} sequence-dependent 1 D diffusion and sequence-independent 3 D diffusion. We quantify how thousands of ``decoy sites'' which have similar base pair sequences as target sites slow down the protein targeting process dramatically. We find the conditions under which the protein targeting process can be sped-up, including the effect of a ``two-state'' protein model, allowing for both rapid diffusion and accurate searching. In the second topic, we investigate how the surface charge density of a poly(amido amine) (or PAMAM) dendrimer affects its ability to condense on DNA, using light scattering, circular dichroism, and single molecule imaging of dendrimer-DNA complexes <b>combed</b> onto <b>surfaces</b> and tethered to those surfaces under flow. This study is important not only for understanding how to condense dsDNA to facilitate its penetration into cell membranes for non-viral gene therapy, but also because PAMAM dendrimers provide an ideal biomimic of DNA-binding proteins (e. g. histones). To describe DNA compaction by dendrimers, we develop a mesoscale model combining a coarse-grained DNA model of de Pablo and coworkers which resolves the DNA double helix structure with a coarse-grained dendrimer model of Muthukumar and coworkers. The predictions of our new model on effects of dendrimer generation, dendrimer surface charge density, and salt concentration on dendrimer-DNA complexes formation are consistent with both {{experiments and}} potential of mean force results from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, but give much more detail regarding the structure of the complex. Moreover, this model can be extended to other cationic macroion-DNA systems which are also of great interest, such as, polylysine, micelles, and colloidal particles...|$|R
40|$|In this system, {{the pipe}} buried in {{concrete}} {{like as a}} shape of <b>Comb</b> below the <b>surface,</b> pavement plates and soils made store thermal energy by passing groundwater in piping. When it is snowing, this system is able to melt snow by supplying both heat of groundwater in piping and energy recovery from pavement plates and soil. 　The following conclusions {{can be obtained by}} the experimental results. 　(1) Thermal energy has been stored in concrete plates and soil approximately 1 meter below ground surface by the heat conduction from pipes in which groundwater is passing. In snowfall, snow-melting ability should be increased by recovering thermal energy already stored in concretes and soils in addition to directly supplying thermal energy through pipes. 　(2) Total heat flux from pipes through concrete to the surface is constantly 230 W/m/m on the case of D-Type with this flow rate. Installations of A,B and D-Type can maintain stable outputs. Also, the more in-let temperature rises, the more total heat flux increases. 　(3) In summer, thermal enrgy will be stored in aquifer, by use of the road for solar-collector. In winter, this hot water is must be repumped up and passed through pipes, therefore snow-melting ability increases efficiently...|$|R
40|$|Haptorian ciliates in the closely similar genera Kentrophyllum and Epiphyllum {{possess a}} unique pattern of ciliature and are {{distinguished}} {{from one another}} only by {{the presence or absence}} of cytoplasmic spines projecting from the margin of the cell. Phylogenetic analyses based on SSU rDNA sequences of three new samples from coastal habitats in China revealed that species in the two genera clustered together indiscriminately (i. e. forms of neither genus clustered into an independent clade) as a maximally supported, monophyletic clade that branches basally to all other clades in the order Pleurostomatida and is strongly divergent from other members of the family in which the genera have been placed. As a result, we propose that Epiphyllum be synonymized with Kentrophyllum and that a new family Kentrophyllidae fam. n. be established for the genus. We hypothesize that the two-sutures of Kentrophyllum is a plesiomorphy within the Pleurostomatida and the unique peripheral kinety might represent an autapomorphy of Kentrophyllum. In addition, we provide a taxonomic revision of Kentrophyllum including description of three new species (K. bispinum sp. n., K. strumosum sp. n., and K. qingdaoense sp. n.), redescription of K. verrucosum (Stokes, 1893) Petz et al., 1995, and three new combinations (K. soliforme (Fauré-Fremiet, 1908) comb. n., K. hohuensis (Wang and Nie, 1933) comb. n. and K. shenzhenense (Pan et al., 2010) <b>comb.</b> n.).

40|$|The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model is a {{next-generation}} mesoscale numerical {{weather prediction}} system. It {{has been designed to}} serve both operational forecasting and atmospheric research needs. It features of multiple dynamical cores and a software architecture allows computational parallelism and system extensibility. WRF model has broad spectrum of applications across scales ranging from meters to thousands of kilometers. Several other models ranging from simple linear algorithms to complex computational fluid dynamics codes have been also developed to simulate the propagation and behavior associated with wildland fire. All attempted in some way to incorporate the effect of the three environmental factors- fuel, weather, and topography, directly corresponding to the fire behavior. Some semi-empirically based fire spread algorithms such as BEHAVE and FARSITE have led to practical in-the-field tools that required simple point or two-dimensional surface values of meteorological fields such as wind as input. The research-quality tools capable of exploring these complex interactions are not easyly available to the research community. The widely-used, established mesoscale models such as MM 5 have recently begun to be applied through regional centers to provide more directed meteorological information to fire operations. However our team from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences has found another tool for wildland fire simulations. In March 2010 has been released a new module <b>combing</b> WRF with <b>surface</b> fire behavior model, called WRF-Fire, Linux based. The semi-empirical formulas calculate the rate of spread of the fire line, the interface between burning and unignited fuel, based on fuel properties, wind velocities from WRF, and terrain slope.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} use of a variety of passive {{frequency}} selective surfaces for specular scatter reduction. Motivation from this work stems from the increased interest in controlling propagation in indoor environments. Influencing the propagation environment using both passive and active structures is of current research interest due to the increased use of wireless devices inside building structures. This thesis aims to develop surfaces suitable for installation on corridor walls to work alongside existing solutions. An initial literature review of frequency selective surfaces; particularly for use inside buildings to create smart environments, suggests reducing the propagation down corridors could be beneficial in decreasing co-channel interference although no solutions have been offered. Development of the initial <b>comb</b> frequency selective <b>surface</b> (CR-FSS) enabled measurement systems and simulation models to be constructed and compared. Due to the various limitations of the CR-FSS, design modifications and evolutions are investigated to overcome issues with poor angular performance, polarisation dependant performance, and experimental manufacture. The initial challenge was to create a rotationally symmetrical surface which could reduce specular scatter from additional angles of incidence in the elevation plane. A pin reflection FSS (PR-FSS) was created, however investigation of the structure showed that it was ineffectual for TE polarisation. In a multipath environment this could be an issue which effects performance. Investigation of additional variations of the CR-FSS such as the slanted comb FSS (SC-FSS) and crenelated CR-FSS complete the analysis. A validation of a frequency selective comb structures is conducted with in-building multipath simulations. Statistical plots show that a comb structure can be used to significantly improve the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of co-channel transmitters at 2. 4 GHz by reducing propagation down a corridor. ...|$|R
