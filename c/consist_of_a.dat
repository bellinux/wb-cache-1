5|$|Apatosaurus louisae {{was named}} by Holland in 1916, being first known from a partial {{skeleton}} {{that was found}} in Utah. The holotype is CM3018, with referred specimens including CM3378, CM11162, and LACM52844. The former two <b>consist</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vertebral column; the latter two <b>consist</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> skull and a nearly complete skeleton, respectively. Apatosaurus louisae specimens all come from the late Kimmeridgian of Dinosaur National Monument. In 2015 Tschopp etal. found the type specimen of Apatosaurus laticollis to nest closely with CM3018, meaning the former is likely a junior synonym of A.louisae.|$|E

5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements.

The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
