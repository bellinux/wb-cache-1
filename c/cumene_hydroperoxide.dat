The chemiluminescence of the perfused liver was oxygen dependent. Ethyl, t-butyl, and <b>cumene</b> <b>hydroperoxides</b> were almost equally effective in inducing light emission in the perfused liver. Glutathione release and chemiluminescence showed a parallel increase upon hydroperoxide {{supply to the}} perfused liver. A partial spectral analysis of the chemiluminescence of the perfused liver showed a predominance of red-light-emitting species, presumably arising from the singlet oxygen dimol-emission peaks. Many side reactions derived from the complex free radical sequence of lipid peroxidation could afford the chemistry leading to light emission, which represents only about 10 (- 14) of the utilization of peroxide...|$|R
40|$|Light-emission of the perfused lung is {{induced by}} t-butyl hydroperoxide, giving {{chemiluminescence}} yields that oscillate between 800 and 1500 counts/s {{depending on the}} site and position of the lung. The response of the perfused lung to infusion with different hydroperoxides gives a pattern similar to that observed with the liver microsomal fraction; ethyl hydroperoxide shows a much higher chemiluminescence yield than the tertiary (t-butyl and <b>cumene)</b> <b>hydroperoxides.</b> Alveolar oedema affected the light-emission of the perfused lung depending on the time at which oedema developed, decreasing light emission on infusion of hydroperoxide in the oedematous lung and increasing it when oedema appeared after the maximal chemiluminescence yield was already achieved. Paraquat, administered in vivo, augmented light-emission by approximately 2 -fold. The effect of paraquat was a time-dependent process. Lung chemiluminescence, compared with liver chemiluminescence, needed higher hydroperoxide concentration to induce light-emission...|$|R
50|$|Most {{peroxides}} {{are generated}} {{by the addition of}} O2 to hydrocarbons. Compounds with allylic and benzylic C−H bonds are amenable to this method. <b>Cumene</b> <b>hydroperoxide</b> is an intermediate in the cumene process of industrial synthesis of phenol. Ethers are susceptible to this reaction, a typical example being the formation of diethyl ether peroxide. The photooxidation of dienes affords dialkyl peroxides.|$|E

40|$|Sequence {{alignment}} and phylogenetic {{analysis has}} identified a new subgroup of glutathione S-transferase (GST) -like proteins {{from a range}} of species extending from plants to humans. This group has been termed the Zeta class. An atomic model of the N-terminal domain suggests that the members of the Zeta class have a similar structure to that of other GSTs, binding glutathione in a similar orientation in the G site. Recombinant human GSTZ 1 - 1 has been expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. The protein is a dimer composed of 24. 2 kDa subunits and has minimal glutathione-conjugating activity with ethacrynic acid and 7 -chloro- 4 -nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazole. Although low in comparison with other GSTs, GSTZ 1 - 1 has glutathione peroxidase activity with t-butyl and <b>cumene</b> <b>hydroperoxides.</b> The members of the Zeta class have been conserved over a long evolutionary period, suggesting that they might have a role in the metabolism of a compound that is common in many living cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in light emission of hydroperoxide-supplemented cytochrome c observed on addition of lipid vesicles {{was related to}} the degree of unsaturation of the fatty acids of the phospholipids: dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine was without effect, whereas dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine and soya-bean phosphatidylcholine enhanced chemiluminescence 2 - and 3 -fold respectively. Effects on light-emission were similar to those on O 2 uptake. The chemiluminescence of the present system was sensitive to cyanide and to the radical trap 2, 5 -di-t-butylquinol, indicating a catlytic activity of cytochrome c and the presence of free-radical species respectively. Lipid-vesicle enhanced chemiluminescence showed different kinetic behaviours, apparently depending on unsaturation: three phases are described for soya-bean phosphatidylcholine, whereas only one phase was present in mixtures containing dipalmitoyl and dioleoyl phospholipids. Chemiluminescence of lipid vesicles supplemented with cytochrome c and hydroperoxide showed similar kinetic patterns with H 2 O 2 and primary (ethyl) and tertiary (t-butyl and <b>cumene)</b> <b>hydroperoxides.</b> Participation of singlet molecular oxygen, mainly on the phase III of chemiluminescence, is suggested by the increase of light-emission by 1, 4 -diazabicyclo[2. 2. 2]-octane as well as by data from spectral analysis...|$|R
40|$|Spin {{trapping}} using 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1 -pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) {{has been}} used to detect and distinguish between the carbon-centred, alkoxyl, and peroxyl radicals produced during the photolytic decomposition of hydroperoxides. Photolysis of tert-butyl and <b>cumene</b> <b>hydroperoxides,</b> and peroxidized fatty acids, in toluene, with low levels of u. v. light, is shown to lead to the initial production of alkoxyl radicals by homolysis of the oxygen-oxygen bond. Subsequent reaction of these radicals with excess hydroperoxide leads, by hydrogen abstraction, to the production of peroxyl radicals that can be detected as their corresponding adducts with the spin trap. Subsequent breakdown of these adducts produces alkoxyl radicals and a further species that {{is believed to be the}} oxidized spin-trap radical 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1 -pyrrolidone- 2 -oxyl. No evidence was obtained at low hydroperoxide concentrations, with either the cumene or lipid alkoxyl radicals, for the occurrence of beta-scission reactions; the production of low levels of carbon-centred radicals is believed to be due to the alternative reactions of hydrogen abstraction, ring closure, and/or 1, 2 hydrogen shifts. Analogous experiments with 3, 3, 5, 5 -tetramethyl- 1 -pyrroline N-oxide (TMPO) led only to the trapping of alkoxyl radicals with no evidence for peroxyl radical adducts, this is presumably due to a decreased rate of radical addition because of increased steric hindrance...|$|R

40|$|Different N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) {{derivatives}} {{were investigated}} as {{catalyst for the}} aerobic oxidation of alkylaromatics, including cumene, phenylcyclohexane and ethylbenzene, leading to the corresponding hydroperoxides in good yields and high selectivity. The employment of different initiators among {{a large number of}} aldehydes, the nature of the solvent and the effect of the temperature, were carefully analysed. The progressive reduction of the solvent-alkylaromatic volumetric ratio was also investigated {{in order to make the}} proposed approach suitable for industrial applications. The issue related to the low solubility of the NHPI in less polar reacting mixtures was effectively worked out by the use of more lipophilic catalysts. In particular, while using aldehydes as initiator, the presence of two or more N-hydroxy moieties on the same molecule seems to be advantageous in order to get better chemical efficiencies respect to molecules bearing a single N-hydroxy group. Bond energy measurements and kinetic data by EPR spectroscopy are also presented as a valid support for explaining the experimental data. The recovery and reuse of the catalyst was obtained through a reversible adsorption onto non-basic amberlyst resins followed by its desorption using non-protic polar solvents. The proposed approach seems to be of particular interest for the industrial application.

50|$|The {{selective}} synthesis of hydroperoxides {{can be carried out}} by free-radical oxidation of alkanes with oxygen.

40|$|Much of {{the gene}} content of the human gastric {{pathogen}} Helicobacter pylori (∼ 1. 7 -Mb genome) is considered essential. This view {{is based on the}} completeness of metabolic pathways, infrequency of nutritional auxotrophies, and paucity of pathway redundancies typically found in bacteria with larger genomes. Thus, genetic analysis of gene function is often hampered by lethality. In the absence of controllable promoters, often used to titrate gene function, we investigated the feasibility of an antisense RNA interference strategy. To test the antisense approach, we targeted alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC), one of the most abundant proteins expressed by H. pylori and one whose function is essential for both in vitro growth and gastric colonization. Here, we show that antisense ahpC (as-ahpC) RNA expression from shuttle vector pDH 37 ::as-ahpC achieved an ∼ 72 % knockdown of AhpC protein levels, which correlated with increased susceptibilities to hydrogen peroxide, <b>cumene,</b> and tert-butyl <b>hydroperoxides</b> but not with growth efficiency. Compensatory increases in catalase levels were not observed in the knockdowns. Expression of single-copy antisense constructs (expressed under the urease promoter and containing an fd phage terminator) from the rdxA locus of mouse-colonizing strain X 47 achieved a 32 % knockdown of AhpC protein levels (relative to wild-type X 47 levels), which correlated with increased susceptibility to organic peroxides but not with mouse colonization efficiency. Our studies indicate that high levels of AhpC are not required for in vitro growth or for primary gastric colonization. Perhaps AhpC, like catalase, assumes a greater role in combating exogenous peroxides arising from lifelong chronic inflammation. These studies also demonstrate the utility of antisense RNA interference in the evaluation of gene function in H. pylori...|$|R

In an effort to understand the pathogenesis of this disease, we have developed an in vivo expression technology (IVET) system to identify genes that are specifically up-regulated during infection. One of the genes that we have identified as being induced in vivo is ohr, encoding organic hydroperoxide reductase, an enzyme that could {{play a role in}} detoxification of organic hydroperoxides generated during infection. Among the 12 serotypes of A. pleuropneumoniae, ohr was found in only serotypes 1, 9, and 11. This distribution correlated with increased resistance to <b>cumene</b> <b>hydroperoxide,</b> an organic hydroperoxide, but not to hydrogen peroxide or to paraquat, a superoxide generator. Functional assays of Ohr activity demonstrated that A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 cultures, but not serotype 5 cultures, were able to degrade <b>cumene</b> <b>hydroperoxide.</b> In A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1, expression of ohr was induced by <b>cumene</b> <b>hydroperoxide,</b> but not by either hydrogen peroxide or paraquat.

40|$|Highly {{purified}} liver microsomal cytochrome P- 450 catalyzes the hydroperoxide-dependent hydroxylation of {{a variety}} of substrates in the absence of NADPH, NADPH-cytochrome P- 450 reductase, and molecular oxygen. The addition of phosphatidylcholine is necessary for maximal activity. The absence of flavoproteins and cytochrome b 5 from the cytochrome P- 450 preparations rules out the involvement of other known microsomal electron carriers. The ferrous form of cytochrome P- 450 is not involved in peroxide-dependent hydroxylation reactions, as indicated by the lack of inhibition by carbon monoxide. With <b>cumene</b> <b>hydroperoxide</b> present, a variety of substrates is attacked, including N-methylaniline, N,N-dimethylaniline, cyclohexane, benzphetamine, and aminopyrine. With benzphetamine as the substrate, <b>cumene</b> <b>hydroperoxide</b> may be replaced by other peroxides, including hydrogen peroxide, or by peracids or sodium chlorite. A study of the stoichiometry indicated that equimolar amounts of N-methylaniline, formaldehyde, and cumyl alcohol ([alpha],[alpha]-dimethylbenzyl alcohol) are formed in the reaction of N,N-dimethylaniline with <b>cumene</b> <b>hydroperoxide.</b> Since H 218 O is incorporated only slightly into cyclohexanol in the reaction of cyclohexane with <b>cumene</b> <b>hydroperoxide,</b> it appears that the oxygen atom in cyclohexanol is derived primarily from the peroxide.

The present study analyzed the early temporal genome-wide transcriptional response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to oxidative stress induced by the aromatic peroxide <b>cumene</b> <b>hydroperoxide.</b> The accurate dataset obtained, supported {{by the use of}} temporal controls, biological replicates and well controlled growth conditions, provided a detailed picture of the early dynamics of the process. We identified a set of genes previously not implicated in the oxidative stress response, including several transcriptional regulators showing a fast transient response, suggesting a coordinated process in the transcriptional reprogramming. We discuss the role of the glutathione, thioredoxin and reactive oxygen species-removing systems, the proteasome and the pentose phosphate pathway. A data-driven clustering of the expression patterns identified one specific cluster that mostly consisted of genes known to be regulated by the Yap 1 p and Skn 7 p transcription factors, emphasizing their mediator role in the transcriptional response to oxidants. Comparison of our results with data reported for hydrogen peroxide identified 664 genes that specifically respond to <b>cumene</b> <b>hydroperoxide,</b> suggesting distinct transcriptional responses to these two peroxides.

40|$|AbstractThe {{peroxidation of lipids}} in {{biological}} membranes is a destructive phenomenon that can be elicited in various ways. Surface receptor molecules that allow cells to respond to hormones are possibly inactivated during lipid peroxidation. Effects of lipid peroxidation on receptors have not been extensively examined thus far. This investigation shows {{that there is a}} decrease in β-adrenoceptor density (measured as specific (—) -[125 I]iodocyanopindolol binding) during lipid peroxidation, in both lungs and erythrocytes of the rat.

The enzyme activator(s) is presumed to be the fatty acid hydroperoxide(s) formed by lipoxygenase. Removal of lipoxygenase from the supernatant fraction by chromatography on Amberlite XAD- 4 also prevented activation, which was restored {{by the addition of}} soya-bean lipoxygenase. Bovine serum albumin prevented O 2 -dependent activation or activation by soya-bean lipoxygenase, through its ability to bind the unsaturated fatty acid substrate of lipoxygenase. The lipoxygenase in the supernatant fraction is inhibited by endogenous glutathione peroxidase plus reduced glutathione (GSH); removal of GSH de-inhibits lipoxygenase and activates guanylate cyclase. This was effected by autoxidation, by <b>cumene</b> <b>hydroperoxide</b> (with GSH peroxidase) and by titration with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Activation by NEM was inhibited by serum albumin or ETYA, as was activation by low concentrations (less than 50 microM) of <b>cumene</b> <b>hydroperoxide.</b> Activation by higher concentrations was not so inhibited; therefore, <b>cumene</b> <b>hydroperoxide</b> can also activate by a direct effect on guanylate cyclase.
