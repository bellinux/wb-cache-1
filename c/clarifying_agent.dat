40|$|The {{effect of}} static {{sedimentation}} {{with and without}} <b>clarifying</b> <b>agents</b> (silica sol and gelatine) upon the nitrogenous fraction of musts and wines was studied. Four vinifications were carried out using a Vitis vinifera cv. Cayetana white grape must. Static sedimentation reduced less than other techniques the assimilable nitrogen (FAN), however the employment of fining agents promoted a net decrease. The changes in the amino acids during fermentation were similar in all the experiments carried out. In general, during the first days there was a fast decrease followed by a slight increment and then stabilisation. This decrease fitted, {{in most of the}} cases, with first order kinetics.

As compared with red wine samples, the percentage losses in luminance values (i. e. in colour intensity) of rosé wines were higher and the resulting values were significantly dependent on the variety.

The fungicide residues on grapes showed different decay rates after treatment, with first-order kinetics and half-lives ranging from 8 to 57 days. Grape processing into wine caused considerable residue reduction with cyprodinil (ca. 80 %), fludioxonil (ca. 70 %), and tebuconazole (ca. 50 %) and no reduction with pyrimethanil. The two wine-making techniques employed (with and without maceration) had the same influence on the residue concentrations in wine, except for fludioxonil which showed maximum residue reduction with vinification with maceration.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of reducing light scattering in isotactic polypropylene (i-PP), through {{the addition of}} so-called clarifying agents, is studied with small-angle light scattering (SALS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The clarifying agents {{used in this study}} depict monotectic phase behavior with i-PP, crystallizing in a relatively narrow concentration range in a nanofibrillar network, providing an ultrahigh nucleation density in the i-PP melt. It is found that the clarifying effect, a dramatically increased transparency and reduced haze, that occurs within the aforementioned additive concentration range, coincides with a change in morphology from strongly scattering spherulites to shish-kebab-like crystalline structures, as evidenced by in situ SALS measurements and confirmed by SEM images. A simple scaling law, relating the diameter of the shish-kebab structures to the fibril diameter and volume fraction of the <b>clarifying</b> <b>agent</b> is proposed, suggesting that the performance of a (fibril-forming) <b>clarifying</b> <b>agent</b> will improve by reducing the fibril diameter and/or increasing the volume concentration of the <b>clarifying</b> <b>agent...</b>|$|E

40|$|The fate of {{residues}} of five insecticides (chlorpyrifos methyl, fenthion, methidathion, parathion methyl, and quinalphos) {{from the}} treatment on vine {{to the production}} of wine was studied.

40|$|Algae {{have been}} {{classified}} by botanists into four large groups: the Chlorophyceae or green algae, the Phaeophyceae or brown algae, the Rhodophyceae or red algae, and the Cyanophyceae or blue-green algae. The polysaccharides which are extracted from marine algae may be differentiated into reserve polysaccharides, analogous to starch in land plants, and into structural polyrsaccharides, analogous to cellulose in land plants. Laminarin from brown seaweeds and Floridean starch from certain red algae are reserve polysaccharides while algihates (from brown seaweeds) and carrageenin and agar (from red seaweeds) are structural polyrsaccharides. The most common encountered algal polycysaccharides, besides alginic acid, are agar and carrageenin. These are salts of sulphate esters of polysaccharides which contain D-galactose. Agar and carrageenin mucilages are obtained by aqueous extraction from certain red seaweeds {{of the class}} Florideae. Agar is extensively used in the meat canning and confectionery trades where it has to a very large extent replaced gelatin. Nearly all the South African production of agar is used in this way.

The must was stirred every 12  h with subsequent reading of the specific gravity, pH, temperature and alcohol content for 4  days. After 4  days, the wine was racked into the secondary fermenter. The secondary fermentation was done in an air tight container in which a tube was passed into a clean bottle containing clean water. The essence was to monitor the course of fermentation. This was allowed until completion of fermentation as was evidenced by lack of the appearance of bubbles in the container usually within 3  weeks. Secondary fermentation was done for 21  days. When fermentation stopped, the wine was promptly racked off the lees ensuring minimum exposure to oxygen. After secondary fermentation, the wines were clarified. The clarification/fining were done using bentonite (a <b>clarifying</b> <b>agent).</b> Exactly 500  g of bentonite was dissolved in two litres of boiling water and stirred properly to a gel form. This was allowed to stand for 24  h. Then 150  g of the gel-like bentonite was transferred into each of the wine followed by stirring to dissolve properly. A small quantity of the mixture was collected in a clean bottle which was covered tightly and was used to monitor the process of clarification. This was done for a period of 3  months. Filtration was done after the wines had completed clarification using muslin cloth, sieve and syphon tubes sterilized by 70  % alcohol. The wines was syphoned into the sieve containing four layers of muslin cloth.

The enzyme is used in the food and beverage industry as a <b>clarifying</b> <b>agent</b> for wines, beers and fruit juices. In Africa, billions of dollars are expended yearly on the importation of commercial enzymes for the food and pharmaceutical industries and this increases the cost of production and the finished goods. This study was carried out to isolate tannase producing fungal species using Bambara nuts as a substrate in a bid to finding alternatives to the importation of tannase. Fresh Bambara nuts were collected from different locations in Nigeria. They were cleaned, sorted and intermittently moistened with water to encourage fungal growth for fourteen days. The different fungi obtained after fourteen days were inoculated onto Potato Dextrose Agar plates and incubated at 25 °C for five days. Subculturing of fungal isolates was carried out to obtain pure cultures of isolates. Tannilytic activity (hydrolysis of tannin) of isolates was assessed by inoculating them in media containing tannin. The plates were incubated at 25 °C for 2 - 5 days after which the plates were observed and zones of hydrolysis measured. A total of eighteen isolates were obtained.
