The authorities know, of course, that they are escaped convicts, but they have no means of identifying them.

The next year they may break out again; but in time the hardships they suffer in the woods become distasteful and they settle down to their prison life, and then, after perhaps six, perhaps ten years of good conduct they are released and allowed to settle where they will.
