5|$|Classes in {{the program}} began in 1955. The program's long-time director, Howard Sheath, {{beginning}} in March 1956, instituted several innovations to the program which proved popular with external students. These included sending lecturers to rural <b>communities</b> <b>to</b> give weekend seminars and establishing University Centres throughout New South Wales for students to assemble for lectures and discussion groups, and take examinations.|$|E

5|$|The station {{opened on}} December 31, 1936 as a station along the Independent Subway System's Queens Boulevard Line. The {{opening of the}} station brought {{significant}} growth to the adjacent community of Forest Hills, transforming them from quiet residential <b>communities</b> <b>to</b> active population centers.|$|E
5|$|CTW {{solicited}} the Educational Testing Service (ETS) {{to conduct}} its summative research. CTW and ETS hired and trained coordinators, testers, and observers from local <b>communities</b> <b>to</b> conduct these studies. The most relevant {{tests of the}} show's effectiveness were comparisons between children who watched it regularly {{and those who did}} not. After the first season, however, Sesame Street was so widely watched that it was difficult to make this distinction; ETS began to have problems finding subjects for their non-viewing groups, which weakened the experimental design. It solved this problem by selecting control-group households from areas that did not broadcast the show. Instead of using groups of viewers and non-viewers, later large-scale studies used statistical designs and methods for estimating cause-effect relationships.|$|E
5|$|Eastern-Rite Catholicism {{was viewed}} with {{suspicion}} by several Latin-Rite bishops in the United States; some, such as Archbishop John Ireland of Saint Paul, Minnesota, were actually hostile, especially concerning {{the matter of}} married clergy. In 1891, Alexis Toth brought a group of 361 Eastern Catholics into Orthodoxy. From then {{until his death in}} 1909, Toth brought approximately 20,000 Eastern Catholics from 65 independent <b>communities</b> <b>to</b> Orthodoxy. By 1917, 163 Eastern-Rite Catholic parishes consisting of more than 100,000 faithful had been converted. For his efforts, Toth was glorified as a saint by the OCA in 1994.|$|E

5|$|Following the government's {{closure of}} most of the schools in the 1960s, the work of Indigenous activists and historians led to greater {{awareness}} by the public of the damage the schools had caused, as well as to official government and church apologies, and a legal settlement. These gains were achieved through the persistent organizing and advocacy by Indigenous <b>communities</b> <b>to</b> draw attention to the residential school system's legacy of abuse, including their participation in hearings of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the {{municipal}} government organized Economic Development Lethbridge, a body responsible for promoting and developing the city's commercial interests. Two years later, the city {{joined in a}} partnership with 24 other local <b>communities</b> <b>to</b> create an economic development alliance called SouthGrow, representing a population of over 140,000. In 2006, Economic Development Lethbridge partnered with SouthGrow Regional Initiative and Alberta SouthWest Regional Alliance to create the Southern Alberta Alternative Energy Partnership. This partnership promotes business related to alternative energy, including wind power, solar power and biofuel, in the region.|$|E
5|$|Levy-Pounds began {{teaching}} law {{as an associate}} professor at the University of St. Thomas (UST) in Minneapolis in 2003. In her research, she has focused on the War on Drugs, incarceration, mandatory sentencing, and sentencing guidelines, primarily as they affect women and children of color, but also young black men. In 2006, Levy-Pounds founded the Community Justice Project (CJP), a partnership between UST's School of Law and the Saint Paul chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The CJP allows law students interested in working with underserved <b>communities</b> <b>to</b> gain experience through academic writing, fora, and interaction with local governments and communities.|$|E

5|$|Many {{wind power}} {{companies}} work with local <b>communities</b> <b>to</b> reduce environmental and other concerns associated with particular wind farms. In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects. Appropriate government consultation, planning and approval procedures {{also help to}} minimize environmental risks. Some may still object to wind farms but, according to The Australia Institute, their concerns should be weighed against the {{need to address the}} threats posed by climate change and the opinions of the broader community.|$|E
5|$|Metagenomics allows {{researchers}} {{to access the}} functional and metabolic diversity of microbial communities, but it cannot show which of these processes are active. The extraction and analysis of metagenomic mRNA (the metatranscriptome) provides information on the regulation and expression profiles of complex communities. Because of the technical difficulties (the short half-life of mRNA, for example) {{in the collection of}} environmental RNA there have been relatively few in situ metatranscriptomic studies of microbial <b>communities</b> <b>to</b> date. While originally limited to microarray technology, metatranscriptomcs studies have made use of transcriptomics technologies to measure whole-genome expression and quantification of a microbial community, first employed in analysis of ammonia oxidation in soils.|$|E
5|$|Nixon is {{assigned}} to General Leslie Groves (Brian Donlevy), who is placed {{in charge of the}} project. Groves has to bring together the scientific, industrial and defense <b>communities</b> <b>to</b> build the atomic bomb. In 1945, following the death of Roosevelt, the new president, Harry S. Truman (Art Baker), continues to support the atomic project, now moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico. When refined uranium-235 is obtained, the first atomic bomb is built and tested successfully in the New Mexico desert. Facing stiff resistance in the Pacific War, Truman orders the use of the atomic bomb against Japan in July 1945.|$|E

Undoubtedly too he was anxious to remove relics from the guardianship of secular <b>communities</b> <b>to</b> a reformed monastic environment. But ultimately even more vital was the link between cult and territorial possession, focused on the saint's role as protector and spiritual lord of his community.|$|E
5|$|Periyar openly {{suggested}} {{to those who}} were marginalised within the Hindu <b>communities</b> <b>to</b> consider converting to other faiths such as Islam, Christianity, or Buddhism. On Islam, he stated how it was good for abolishing the disgrace in human relationship, based on one of his speeches to railway employees at Tiruchirapalli in 1947. Periyar also commended Islam for its belief in one invisible and formless God; proclamation of equal rights for men and women; and advocating of social unity.|$|E
5|$|Shortwave {{listening}}, or SWLing, is {{the hobby}} {{of listening to}} shortwave radio broadcasts located on frequencies between 1700 kHz and 30 MHz. Listeners range from casual users seeking international news and entertainment programming, to hobbyists immersed in {{the technical aspects of}} radio reception and collecting official confirmations (QSL cards) that document their reception of distant broadcasts (DXing). In some developing countries, shortwave listening enables remote <b>communities</b> <b>to</b> obtain regional programming traditionally provided by local medium wave AM broadcasters. In 2002, the number of households that were capable of shortwave listening was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.|$|E

Party leader Wei Ping Chen had immigrated to Canada from Beijing, via Australia. He {{witnessed}} the challenges that recent immigrants faced once in a new country, and how uninvolved they were in politics. Contrasted to his experience in China, Wei Ping Chen {{was impressed with the}} political freedoms available in Canada and felt motivated to start a political party. He felt that political campaigns oriented towards recent immigrants and people whose first language is not English, would empower those <b>communities</b> <b>to</b> become more politically active.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} peoples of Taiwan face {{economic and social}} barriers, including a high unemployment rate and substandard education. Since the early 1980s, many aboriginal groups have been actively seeking {{a higher degree of}} political self-determination and economic development. The revival of ethnic pride is expressed in many ways by aborigines, including the incorporation of elements of their culture into commercially successful pop music. Efforts are under way in indigenous <b>communities</b> <b>to</b> revive traditional cultural practices and preserve their traditional languages. The Austronesian Cultural Festival in Taitung City is one means by which community members promote aboriginal culture. In addition, several aboriginal communities have become extensively involved in the tourism and ecotourism industries with the goal of achieving increased economic self-reliance and preserving their culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of 19th- and 20th-century missionaries has both transformed and maintained aboriginal integration. Many {{of the churches}} have replaced earlier community functions, but continue to retain a sense of continuity and community that unites members of aboriginal societies against the pressures of modernity. Several church leaders have emerged from within the <b>communities</b> <b>to</b> take on leadership positions in petitioning {{the government in the}} interest of indigenous peoples and seeking a balance between the interests of the communities and economic vitality.|$|E
