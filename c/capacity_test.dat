40|$|Objective: Psychophysical lift <b>capacity</b> <b>tests</b> are lifting {{tests in}} which the performance, {{expressed}} in Newtons, is divided by the perceived exertion, expressed on a Borg scale. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse test-retest reliability of psychophysical lift <b>capacity</b> <b>tests.</b> Subjects: Patients with non-specific chronic low back pain (n= 20) and healthy subjects (n= 20). Methods: Psychophysical lift <b>capacity</b> <b>tests</b> were assessed during a back school intake at the Centre for Rehabilitation of the University Medical Centre Groningen. Patients on the waiting list and healthy subjects were assessed twice, with a 2 -week interval between assessments. Intra-class correlation (ICC) was calculated as a measure of reliability. An ICC >= 0. 75 was considered as an acceptable reliability. Limits of agreement as a measure for natural variation were calculated. Results: The psychophysical static and dynamic lift <b>capacity</b> <b>tests</b> showed good reliability (ICC >= 0. 75). The limits of agreement are substantial, indicating a considerable natural variation between test-sessions for all psychophysical tests. Conclusion: The psychophysical static lift capacity and dynamic lifting capacity are reliable instruments for patients with non-specific chronic low back pain and healthy subjects. However, a substantial amount of natural variation should be taken into account between 2 test sessions when interpreting the test results clinically...|$|R

5000|$|The single-breath {{diffusing}} <b>capacity</b> <b>test</b> is {{the most}} common way to determine [...] The test is performed by having the subject blow out all of the air that he/she can, leaving only the residual lung volume of gas. The person then inhales a test gas mixture rapidly and completely, reaching the total lung capacity as nearly as possible. This test gas mixture contains a small amount of carbon monoxide (usually 0.3%) and a tracer gas that is freely distributed throughout the alveolar space but which doesn't cross the alveolar-capillary membrane. Helium and methane are two such gasses. The test gas is held in the lung for about 10 seconds during which time the CO (but not the tracer gas) continuously moves from the alveoli into the blood. Then the subject exhales.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} that communication involves the working memory system, which becomes increasingly engaged in understanding speech as the input signal degrades. The more resources allocated to recovering a degraded input signal, the fewer resources, referred to as cognitive spare capacity, remain for higher-level processing of speech. Using simulated natural listening environments, the aims of this paper were to (1) evaluate an English version of a recently introduced auditory test to measure cognitive spare capacity that targets the updating process of the executive function, (2) investigate if the test predicts speech comprehension better than the reading span test commonly used to measure working memory capacity, and (3) determine if the test is sensitive to {{increasing the number of}} attended locations during listening. In experiment I, the cognitive spare <b>capacity</b> <b>test</b> was presented using a male and a female talker, in quiet and in spatially separated babble- and cafeteria-noises, in an audio-only and in an audio-visual mode. Data collected on 21 listeners with normal and impaired hearing confirmed that the English version of the cognitive spare <b>capacity</b> <b>test</b> is sensitive to population group, noise condition, and clarity of speech, but not presentation modality. In experiment II, performance by 27 normal-hearing listeners on a novel speech comprehension test presented in noise was significantly associated with working memory capacity, but not with cognitive spare capacity. Moreover, this group showed no significant difference in cognitive spare capacity as the number of talker locations in the test increased. There was no consistent association between the cognitive spare <b>capacity</b> <b>test</b> and the reading span test. It is recommended that future studies investigate the psychometric properties of the cognitive spare <b>capacity</b> <b>test,</b> and examine its sensitivity to the complexity of the listening environment in participants with both normal and impaired hearing...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Sustained {{attention}} {{refers to}} the ability to maintain attention in target stimuli over a sustained period of time. This study was conducted to develop a Persian version of the sustained auditory attention <b>capacity</b> <b>test</b> and to study its results in normal children. Methods: To develop the Persian version of the sustained auditory attention <b>capacity</b> <b>test,</b> like the original version, speech stimuli were used. The speech stimuli consisted of one hundred monosyllabic words consisting of a 20 times random of and repetition of the words of a 21 -word list of monosyllabic words, which were randomly grouped together. The test was carried out at comfortable hearing level using binaural, and diotic presentation modes on 46 normal children of 7 to 11 years of age of both gender. Results: There was a significant difference between age, and an average of impulsiveness error score (p= 0. 004) and total score of sustained auditory attention <b>capacity</b> <b>test</b> (p= 0. 005). No significant difference was revealed between age, and an average of inattention error score and attention reduction span index.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In primary care, formal {{functional}} <b>capacity</b> <b>testing</b> is {{not always}} feasible. Guidelines for family practitioners suggest the use of dyspnoea scales to assess exercise tolerance in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). AIMS: To examine whether the use of activity-based dyspnoea scales can substitute for actual functional <b>capacity</b> <b>testing.</b> METHODS: 128 subjects (49 % at risk of COPD, 24 % GOLD stage I, 17 % GOLD stage II, 9 % GOLD stage III) performed an Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT) and completed the Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale (MRC), Baseline Dyspnoea Index (BDI), Oxygen Cost Diagram (OCD), Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ), and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). RESULTS: Analysis of variance showed that the relationship between the ISWT and the MRC dyspnoea scale was statistically significant but moderate (p < 0. 001, R 2 = 0. 166). Correlations between the ISWT and the other dyspnoea scales were also moderate (correlation coefficients 0. 34 - 0. 42). Combining the dyspnoea scales in one analysis resulted in a proportion of explained variance of the ISWT of 21. 4 % (R 2 = 0. 214). CONCLUSIONS: Dyspnoea scales cannot substitute for formal functional <b>capacity</b> <b>testing.</b> Authors of COPD guidelines should consider stating more specifically that the MRC and similar scales measure (self-reported) activity-related dyspnoea but cannot replace objectively measured functional capacity...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this pilot study was to {{evaluate}} {{the relationships between the}} 20 M Sprint <b>Capacity</b> <b>Test</b> utilizing SmartWheel technology and other speed evaluation techniques. The goal of the 20 M Sprint <b>Capacity</b> <b>Test</b> is to provide an objective protocol for coaches and players to measure speed, training, and performance growth. All participants (N = 17) performed two trials of the 20 M Sprint <b>Capacity</b> <b>test</b> with the SmartWheel placed on each side of a wheelchair, provided by the researcher. Results of this research focus on the potential relationships existing between the variables of push length (r =. 650), push frequency (r =. 594), peak force (r =. 540), and speed performance as measured in meters/second by the SmartWheel. The relationships between classification level of the athletes and speed in meters/second suggested a significant relationship (r =. 859). Due to the highly correlated relationship between classification level and speed, athlete classification (i. e., class) was partialed out to control for this relationship. When partial correlations were analyzed, push length and speed were no longer significantly correlated (r =. 175, p =. 532). Push frequency and speed (m/s) remained significantly correlated (r =. 573, p =. 026); however, peak force and speed (m/s) also were no longer significantly correlated (r =. 464, p =. 081).

40|$|One of the {{bottlenecks}} in the logistic {{planning process}} at Netherlands Railways is {{the capacity of}} the infrastructure at the larger railway stations.
