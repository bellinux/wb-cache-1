In this paper, {{according}} to the reality {{that there is no}} mature Chinese national design criterion but partial enterprise standard for rock bolt <b>crane</b> <b>girder</b> in the underground powerhouse of large hydropower station up to now. Based on the geological conditions, the rock bolt <b>crane</b> <b>girder</b> was designed by using method of rigid body equilibrium. The reinforced anchoring measures for rock bolt <b>crane</b> <b>girder</b> in undesirable geology were studied subsequently by the experience of analogous projects. The stability of rock bolt <b>crane</b> <b>girder</b> in underground powerhouse was analyzed and evaluated by Finite Element Method (FEM). Then the bearing capacity of crane beam was researched by means of bearing testing. The results show FEM is practicable to evaluate the stability of the rock bolt <b>crane</b> <b>girder</b> and to guide the rock bolt <b>crane</b> <b>girder</b> designing.

In the reconstruction, the main body can only be reinforced, not be dismounted, and the reconstruction project can not affect the unloading, {{so it is with}} great difficulty. The available plan of the reconstruction is researched and adopted. The inner force of <b>crane</b> <b>girder</b> and bridging beam is calculated by using the theory of elasticity support continuous beam. The piles are assigned with reason, the differential settlement between the new and the old building is nearly eliminated, and the bearing condition of the main structure is improved. So it is needless to carry through driving pile over water or subbottom reinforcing pile foundation under the cross frame of the former wharf.

40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{the present}} work is to study the {{influence}} of design parameters on the stress-deformed state of a sprengel crane girder; to compile the tables and corresponding graphs illustrating changes in internal force factors in the characteristic cross-sections of the system elements under consideration. The article describes {{the study of the}} stress-deformed state (SDS) of a metal strut-framed <b>crane</b> <b>girder.</b> Methods. Numerical methods of analysis based {{on the use of the}} Green's function are used during solving this problem. A dimensionless parameter is introduced, depending on which the tables and graphs are constructed. According to the known algorithm, the calculations of internal force factors in the sections of the considered construction are performed. Results. Depending on the dimensionless parameter characterising the geometry and physical features of the system, tables of bending moments and transverse forces are compiled. According to these tables, the appropriate graphs are plotted in order to choose easily the optimal design parameters. Conclusion. The dependence of the moments and transverse forces on the dimensionless parameter k was found, the corresponding graphs were plotted and the metal costs for the girders were calculated. The minimum values of the moments and transverse forces are established to take place when the dimensionless parameter k values are close to zero. The most economical was a strut-framed <b>crane</b> <b>girder</b> having k = 0. 0001. The most uneconomical had k = 0. 05 and k =∞. Eventually, the sprengel girders were found to be more profitable as compared to conventional crane girders. In the examples considered in the article, the metal savings amounted up to 14 %.

40|$|In {{torsion-box}} {{design of}} twin girder overhead cranes, the bridge rail {{on which the}} lifting unit runs is positioned eccentrically on the girder, directly above one of the web plates. This web is subjected to in-plane patch loading produced by the spread of a wheel load through the overlying rail and flange. This study concerns the load carrying capacity of plate box-girder web panels subjected to a wheel load at the midspan of the panel. Distribution of a wheel load through a rail and flange is investigated from recordings made of in-plane vertical stress distribution profiles along the upper edge of a web panel of a short-span model box-girder. The girder was loaded through various interfaces above the web by a wheel load. A simple method is proposed for relating a distributed wheel load to an equivalent uniform patch load. Methods for estimating distributed wheel loading lengths are investigated. It is shown that crane web panels are generally subjected to patch loads of short length, occupying less than one-quarter of the panel length. A computer analysis is presented to determine elastic buckling coeffic-ients for flat rectangular plates subjected to a uniform in-plane patch load centrally disposed on one edge and supported by shear stresses on the adjacent edges. Patch loads of various lengths are considered over a range of plate aspect ratios for plates with various combinations of simply supported and clamped edges. Also considered are some non-uniformly distributed patch loads modelling approximately a distributed wheel load. For {{the large majority of}} geometries considered, it is the support condition along the loaded edge which has greatest influence on the buckling load. Correlation with buckling loads estimated from experimental measurements on a model <b>crane</b> <b>girder</b> web panel indicated that an assumption of simply supported panel edges is over-conservative and that it is probably more representative to consider the edges attached to the flanges as clamped. Ultimate load carrying capacity is considered. A plastic mechanism analysis originally presented by Roberts and Rockey is studied and a modified form derived which reveals the transition region from collapse initiated by direct web yielding for girders with stocky webs to failure by a mechanism of out-of-plane web deformation for girders with slender webs. Certain approximations in the original analysis are shown to involve the omission of terms which can contribute significantly to the plastic work expression. Inclusion of these terms, however, whilst offering potential refinement, increases considerably the complexity of the analysis. Results are presented of a series of collapse tests conducted on short-span model box-girders subjected to a wheel load above one of the webs. The effect on the failure load of rail size, web thickness, panel aspect ratio, and longitudinal web stiffening is investigated. Snap buckling was exhibited by several of the test web panels. From the results, a simple expression is developed for predicting collapse loads of plate girders subjected to narrow patch loads. The main findings of the work are used as a basis for a series of recommendations to aid the structural designer in taking account of patch loading on slender web panels...|$|E
