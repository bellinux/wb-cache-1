A design called MARCO MM-100 by the Mid-American Research Corporation used a Porsche air-cooled engine and independent suspension. A unique feature was {{the absence of a}} <b>conventional</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>system.</b> The prototype did not have a muffler or pipe rather the exhaust was routed through the frame. This proved to be an inferior design because the condensation and acidic fumes caused premature frame failure. A competing prototype by Willys, the 1953 Bobcat or [...] "Aero Jeep", which would share as many parts as possible with the M38 and M38A1 to save costs, was rejected in favor of the more advanced M422.|$|E

40|$|The NASA Langley Configuration Aerodynamics Branch has {{conducted}} an experimental investigation {{to study the}} static performance of innovative thrust reverser concepts applicable to high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines. Testing was conducted on a <b>conventional</b> separate-flow <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> configuration, a <b>conventional</b> cascade thrust reverser configuration, and six innovative thrust reverser configurations. The innovative thrust reverser configurations consisted of a cascade thrust reverser with porous fan-duct blocker, a blockerless thrust reverser, two core-mounted target thrust reversers, a multi-door crocodile thrust reverser, and a wing-mounted thrust reverser. Each of the innovative thrust reverser concepts offer potential weight savings and/or design simplifications over a conventional cascade thrust reverser design. Testing was conducted in the Jet-Exit Test Facility at NASA Langley Research Center using a 7. 9 %-scale <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> model with a fan-to-core bypass ratio of approximately 9. 0. All tests were conducted with no external flow and cold, high-pressure air was used to simulate core and fan exhaust flows. Results show that the innovative thrust reverser concepts achieved thrust reverser performance levels which, when {{taking into account the}} potential for system simplification and reduced weight, may make them competitive with, or potentially more cost effective than current state-of-the-art thrust reverser systems.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} application of a liquid desiccant dehumidifier system in confined building spaces. The proposed dehumidifier system controls the humidity ratio of the confined space when a large amount of moisture is released, and uses ambient space air for regeneration when the spaces produce no moisture. The generated moisture air during the regeneration period can be discharged through continuous exhaust ventilation. ^ In the dissertation, the physical system design is described and dehumidifier performance models and CFD models are integrated and developed. Numerical simulations were conducted to compare the results of a conventional ventilation system and a dehumidifier system. ^ The results of the simulations show that the dehumidifier system reduced moisture condensation by 24. 0 % over a <b>conventional</b> <b>exhaust</b> ventilation <b>system.</b> It was also found that the configurations of the confined space and dehumidifier, e. g., the locations of the inlet air, exhaust air and moisture source, significantly impacted the space air humidity ratio and temperature distributions. ^ The theoretical analysis in the feasibility investigation suggests that an optimal dehumidifier system reduces moisture condensation and saves energy. Thus, the system optimizations are achieved by three approaches: optimal dehumidifier design parameters, improved dehumidifier location, and optimal regeneration period. ^ The results of the optimizations show that an improved dehumidifier location can reduce moisture condensation by 33. 1 % over the original dehumidifier location in the feasibility investigation. In addition, use of an optimal reheat desiccant temperature can reduce the regeneration period by 16. 0 % and the total performance period by 12. 5 %. ^ Yearly energy consumption and cost were compared between a base ventilation system and an optimal dehumidifier system for a bathroom in a hotel at two locations of Miami and Omaha. The comparisons were conducted for both systems with the same amount of accumulated condensation on the surfaces of the space. The total yearly electricity energy consumption in an optimal dehumidifier system can be saved by 63. 7 % in Omaha and 65. 2 % in Miami. The heating consumption can be saved by 66. 7 % in Omaha and 66. 7 % in Miami. The average yearly energy cost saving is around 65. 5 %. ...|$|R

The <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> is defined as a series of chambers and pipes that starts at the engine and ends {{at the back of the}} car with the tail pipe. However if there are any leaks in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>system,</b> it provide a direct path for the emission gaseous including carbon monoxide to enter can be very dangerous as it provides a direct path for carbon monoxide and other dangerous gaseous emissions to enter the cowl vent at the base of the windshield and directly to the passenger compartment.

40|$|A {{detailed}} experimental, theoretical, and computational {{study of}} separated nozzle flows has been conducted. Experimental testing was {{performed at the}} NASA Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel Complex. As {{part of a comprehensive}} static performance investigation, force, moment, and pressure measurements were made and schlieren flow visualization was obtained for a sub-scale, non-axisymmetric, two-dimensional, convergent- divergent nozzle. In addition, two-dimensional numerical simulations were run using the computational fluid dynamics code PAB 3 D with two-equation turbulence closure and algebraic Reynolds stress modeling. For reference, experimental and computational results were compared with theoretical predictions based on one-dimensional gas dynamics and an approximate integral momentum boundary layer method. Experimental results from this study indicate that off-design overexpanded nozzle flow was dominated by shock induced boundary layer separation, which was divided into two distinct flow regimes; three- dimensional separation with partial reattachment, and fully detached two-dimensional separation. The test nozzle was observed to go through a marked transition in passing from one regime to the other. In all cases, separation provided a significant increase in static thrust efficiency compared to the ideal prediction. Results indicate that with controlled separation, the entire overexpanded range of nozzle performance would be within 10 % of the peak thrust efficiency. By offering savings in weight and complexity over a <b>conventional</b> mechanical <b>exhaust</b> <b>system,</b> this may allow a fixed geometry nozzle to cover an entire flight envelope. The computational simulation was in excellent agreement with experimental data over most of the test range, and {{did a good job of}} modeling internal flow and thrust performance. An exception occurred at low nozzle pressure ratios, where the two-dimensional computational model was inconsistent with the three-dimensional separation observed in the experiment. In general, the computation captured the physics of the shock boundary layer interaction and shock induced boundary layer separation in the nozzle, though there were some differences in shock structure compared to experiment. Though minor, these differences could be important for studies involving flow control or thrust vectoring of separated nozzles. Combined with other observations, this indicates that more detailed, three-dimensional computational modeling needs to be conducted to more realistically simulate shock-separated nozzle flows...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Recently, open-type {{push-pull}} {{ventilation systems}} have been widely employed as effective substitutes for the <b>conventional</b> local <b>exhaust</b> ventilation <b>system,</b> and have prevailed at many welding workshops in Japan. In this study, {{the effect of the}} uniform velocity on carbon dioxide (CO 2) shielding arc welding was examined by laboratory experiments. The ventilation system examined in the experiments successfully fulfilled the requirement for open-type push-pull ventilators prescribed in Japanese regulations (ordinances). It was proved that the velocity at any points in the capture zone fell in the range of 50 to 150 % of the average capture zone velocity. Welding defects could be avoided by controlling the flow rate of shielding gas. Unless the capture velocity exceeded a 0. 8 m/ s, the formation of blow-holes in the welded metal could be prevented at the shielding gas flow rate of 20 L/min. If the flow rate was provided at 30 L/min and 40 L/min, blow-holes didn’t form at the capture velocity of 1. 2 m/s and 1. 6 m/s, respectively. At a capture velocity of faster than 0. 3 m/s, the fume concentration at welder’s breathing zone was reduced to a level below the limit values: ACGIH (TLV) and Japan Welding Engineering Society (CLV #).
