5|$|Marine {{deposition}} occurred 1200 to 800 Ma, creating thick {{sequences of}} conglomerate, mudstone, and carbonate rock topped by stromatolites, and possibly glacial deposits from the hypothesized Snowball Earth event. Rifting thinned huge roughly linear {{parts of the}} supercontinent Rodinia enough to allow sea water to invade and divide its landmass into component continents separated by narrow straits. A passive margin developed {{on the edges of}} these new seas in the Death Valley region. Carbonate banks formed on this part of the two margins only to be subsided as the continental crust thinned until it broke, giving birth to a new ocean basin. An accretion wedge of clastic sediment then started to accumulate {{at the base of the}} submerged precipice, entombing the region's first known fossils of complex life. These sandy mudflats gave way about 550 Ma to a <b>carbonate</b> <b>platform</b> which lasted for the next 300 million years of Paleozoic time.|$|E

The platforms aggraded over time and backstepped to keep pace with increasing rates of relative sea level rise. Karst features are recognizable on seismic sections and indicate that the platforms were subaerially exposed at various times during their development.

500|$|Beyond {{the keys}} in the Atlantic Ocean the {{seafloor}} slopes gradually down before rising in an almost continuous coral reef. The reef, composed of living corals, is inhabited by more than 200 species of fish, as well as molluscs, crustaceans and worms. Every coral species in park waters is considered protected by either federal or state regulations. Coral reefs are estimated to cover about half {{the area of the}} park, with about 4000 individual patch reefs and areas of bank-barrier reef. Hundreds of species of hard and soft corals, sea anemones and sponges are found in bay and offshore waters. The coral reefs may themselves be subdivided into the outer reef {{on the edge of the}} Florida <b>carbonate</b> <b>platform,</b> the patch reefs between the outer reef and the keys, and the reefs in the shoals on either side of the keys. The offshore reefs are dominated by elkhorn coral to [...] water depth, and staghorn coral below 10 meters. The landward patch reefs are principally composed of boulder star coral and symmetrical brain coral. The island shoal reefs mainly consist of lesser starlet coral and Porites finger corals.|$|E

The rocks were formed as a thick series of carbonate sediments were deposited between the Norian and Late Cretaceous as the Adriatic <b>Carbonate</b> <b>Platform,</b> up to [...] deep. In the Eocene and early Oligocene, the Adriatic Plate moved north and north-east, contributing to the Alpine orogeny via the tectonic uplift of the Dinarides. The basin's karst topography developed from the carbonate platform's exposure to weathering. Karstification largely began after the Dinarides' final uplift in the Oligocene and the Miocene, when the carbonates were exposed to atmospheric effects; this extended {{to the level of}} [...] below the present sea level, exposed during the Last Glacial Maximum. Some karst formations were created during earlier sea level drops, most notably the Messinian salinity crisis. The geological structure of the area indicates recent tectonic activity in the catchment, with a fault running between Hum and the Ombla. A recent strong earthquake in the wider region was the 1979 Montenegro earthquake, measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale. The only strong historical earthquake in the immediate area was the 1667 Dubrovnik earthquake, which was followed by a tsunami.|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{isolated}} <b>carbonate</b> <b>platforms</b> {{developed in}} the Central Luconia Province of offshore Sarawak (during Middle to Late Miocene time). Fault-bounded highs produced largely by extensional deformation and later overprinted by strike-slip deformation provided substrates for the platforms and affected their growth histories. Flooding of these structural highs at ~ 16. 5 Ma initiated carbonate sedimentation nearly simultaneously across the area. Later, third-order sea-level fluctuations and extrinsic factors such as differential subsidence, paleowind patterns and siliciclastic influx then controlled the internal architecture of the platforms. 2 -D regional seismic lines, publicdomain data and published literature were used to analyze growth patterns and demise of <b>carbonate</b> <b>platforms</b> across the study area. Five Growth Stages were recognized in the <b>carbonate</b> <b>platforms</b> based on seismic facies analysis and stratigraphic relationships between reflectors. Platforms from the southeastern part of Central Luconia are thicker and larger than platforms located toward the central and northwestern areas, which reflect greater long-term tectonic subsidence to the southeast. Additionally, northwestward prograding siliciclastic sediments from mainland Borneo caused additional flexural subsidence {{in the eastern part}} of the area and environmental deterioration for platforms located beyond the range of active siliciclastic sedimentation. Both of these factors reduced the growth potential of platforms and thus subdued <b>carbonate</b> development. <b>Platform</b> termination was regionally diachronous and was produced in two steps. The first platforms drowned (~ 12. 5 - 9. 7 Ma) were in the eastern parts of the study area which were affected by incoming siliciclastic sediments and high local subsidence. Platforms drowned later (~ 6. 3 - 5. 5 Ma) were caused by a rapid sea-level rise combined with an intense local subsidence. Carbonate accumulation rates were measured between intraplatform markers, resulting in a trend that indicates a decrease in sedimentation rate with the square root of time. Comparisons between Central Luconia carbonates and age-equivalent <b>carbonate</b> <b>platforms</b> elsewhere in East Natuna Basin showed that Central Luconia <b>carbonate</b> <b>platforms</b> were drowned earlier (latest late Miocene time) than East Natuna <b>carbonate</b> <b>platforms</b> (Early Pliocene time) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{integrated}} stratigraphic {{study was}} conducted on the shallow water <b>carbonate</b> <b>platforms</b> of the Guadeloupe archipelago to refine the tectonic evolution of the Lesser Antilles forearc. The <b>carbonate</b> <b>platforms</b> are now dated to the Zanclean-Calabrian interval, and their demise occurred between 1. 5 and 1. 07 [*]Ma. The precise chronostratigraphy allows dating of the main extensional tectonic events since the late Miocene. An initial episode occurred during the late Miocene, related to the reactivation of inherited N 130 °E-trending shear zones, and led to the emergence of most parts of the forearc. Subsequently, Zanclean to early Piacenzian <b>carbonate</b> <b>platforms</b> developed in association with a general subsidence of the forearc. During the late Piacenzan, a second extensional episode occurred. At this time La Désirade underwent major uplift and emergence whereas most of the forearc remained submerged. Prior to 1. 07 [*]Ma, a third north-south extensional episode occurred and led to the final demise of the <b>carbonate</b> <b>platforms.</b> Thus the forearc was characterized by general subsidence since the early Pliocene interrupted by three main extensional episodes and related differential uplifts.

In particular, platform responses to oceanic anoxic events and other periods of major perturbation in the global carbon cycle are analysed (early Toarcian, Aalenian-Bajocian, Oxfordian-Tithonian, Valanginian-Hauterivian, Aptian-Albian, Cenomanian-Turonian, Coniacian-Santonian). Lower Jurassic levels of the Trento Platform record platform devastation in the early Toarcian synchronous with a major negative δ 13 C carb excursion, followed by platform recovery synchronous with a pronounced δ 13 C carb positive excursion and return to background values. The Campania-Lucania Platform shows negligible response to the oceanographic events of the early Toarcian even though the characteristic carbon-isotope profile is readily identifiable. The Trento Platform drowned at approximately the Aalenian-Bajocian Stage boundary, synchronously with a reproducible negative followed by positive δ 13 C carb excursion, whereas the Campania-Lucania Platform underwent a facies transition from oolite to cyclically bedded micrite. The Friuli Platform showed negligible depositional response to the carbon-cycle perturbations of the Kimmeridgian-Tithonian, Valanginian-Hauterivian, Aptian-Albian and Cenomanian- Santonian (as registered in the δ 13 C carb record).
