5|$|In 1982, Waters {{suggested}} a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With {{the onset of}} the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the <b>credit</b> <b>list,</b> reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.|$|E
500|$|After {{months of}} poor relations, and {{following}} a final confrontation, Gilmour {{was removed from}} the <b>credit</b> <b>list</b> as producer, but would still be paid his production royalties. [...] Waters later admitted that he was also under significant pressure and that early in the production of The Final Cut he believed he would never record with either Gilmour or Mason again. [...] He may have threatened to release the album as a solo record, although Pink Floyd were contracted to EMI and such a move would have been unlikely. [...] Mason kept himself distant, dealing with his own marital problems.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} the album was mixed to generally positive. Imran Ahmed of the New Musical Express enjoyed [...] "genius single 'AM to PM'", and praised the tracks [...] "Got to Have You" [...] and [...] "When You Look at Me". Ahmed guessed that [...] "beneath the froth, there's a certain depth of soul" [...] in Milian, and thought [...] "Get Away" [...] had similar excellent results to her previous collaboration with Ja Rule, [...] "Between Me and You". The reviewer also commended the lyrics of [...] "Twitch", which he thought was [...] "remarkable for being {{what may be the}} first ever song about someone with a facial tic". Ahmed was impressed that alongside the impressive production <b>credit</b> <b>list,</b> it was [...] "still Milian's name that tops the list of executive producers", and predicted, [...] "genius can't be more than a few albums away". Contrastingly, Andrew Lynch of entertainment.ie described the album as [...] "relentlessly ordinary", and suggested that Milian needed original ideas. The reviewer felt that apart from [...] "AM to PM" [...] and [...] "You Make Me Laugh" [...] there was nothing above the average. Lynch said that if Milian [...] "really wants to compete with the big girls, she badly needs to spice up her tired formula." ...|$|E

500|$|Careful {{consideration}} {{was given}} to the album's title. The initial three contenders were Signs of Life, Of Promises Broken and Delusions of Maturity. For the first time since 1977's Animals, designer Storm Thorgerson was employed to work on a Pink Floyd studio album cover. His finished design was a long river of hospital beds arranged on a beach, inspired by a phrase from [...] "Yet Another Movie" [...] and Gilmour's vague hint of a design that included a bed in a Mediterranean house, as well as [...] "vestiges of relationships that have evaporated, leaving only echoes". [...] The cover shows hundreds of hospital beds, placed on Saunton Sands in Devon (where some of the scenes for Pink Floyd – The Wall were filmed). [...] The beds were arranged by Thorgerson's colleague Colin Elgie. [...] A hang glider {{can be seen in the}} sky, a clear reference to [...] "Learning to Fly". The photographer, Robert Dowling, won a gold award at the Association of Photographers Awards for the image, which took about two weeks to create. [...] To drive home the message that Waters had left the band, the inner gatefold featured a group photograph – of just Gilmour and Mason – shot by David Bailey. Its inclusion marked the first time since 1971's Meddle that a group photo had been used in the artwork of a Pink Floyd album. Richard Wright was represented only by name, on the <b>credit</b> <b>list,</b> although he also appears in photographs included in later reissues.|$|E
2500|$|The primary cast, all of {{whom were}} German besides Fiennes, Olin, and Winslet, decided to emulate Kross's accent since he had just learned English for the film. Chris Menges {{replaced}} Roger Deakins as cinematographer. One of the film's producers, Scott Rudin, left the production over a dispute about the rushed editing process to ensure a 2008 release date and had his name removed from the <b>credit</b> <b>list.</b> Rudin differed with Harvey Weinstein [...] "because he didn't want to campaign for an Oscar along with Doubt and Revolutionary Road, which also stars Winslet." [...] Winslet won the Best Actress Academy Award for The Reader. Marc Caro wrote, [...] "Because Winslet couldn't get Best Actress nominations for both movies, the Weinstein Co. shifted her to supporting actress for The Reader as a courtesy..." [...] but that it is [...] "... up to [...] to place the name in the category that they think is appropriate to the performance", resulting in her receiving more Best Actress nomination votes for this film than the Best Actress submission of her Revolutionary Road performance. Winslet's head-to-head performances also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for Revolutionary Road and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for The Reader.|$|E

50|$|Denby {{focused on}} {{constructing}} affordable homes which reflected working class needs. Several prominent architects worked with her. Notably Maxwell Fry collaborated with {{her with his}} essays on the Modern Movement style: the scheme for low rental flats, Sassoon House in Peckham, which was completed in 1934, and the later Kensal House (1937) which was commissioned by the Gas, Light and Coke Company. Denby and Fry collaborated on this project for four years, but in 1937, Denby's name was omitted from the <b>credit</b> <b>list</b> for both schemes in two major publications.She is credited with prompting Fry to adopt a more progressive style. Denby's work to create more affordable living for the working class eventually resulted in houses that appeared cheap and unrealistic.|$|E
5000|$|... "With such {{a cast of}} characters, it's little {{surprise}} that the film soon swiftly veers away from any idea of being a 'how-to' guide to comedy.
