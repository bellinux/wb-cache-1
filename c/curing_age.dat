In this paper, the mathematical models of relationship between compressive strength (<b>curing</b> <b>age</b> of 540 days) and <b>curing</b> <b>age</b> (28 and 90 days) are established {{on the basis of}} multitudinous of tests. Comparing the value obtained by calculating model with experimental value, we find that they have well consistency. The establishment of these models provide the basis for making plastic concrete standard procedures and carrying out numerical analysis, and they also offer reference for engineering application of plastic concrete. 1...|$|E

A total of 288 cubes of 100 mm dimensions were cast and cured in water for 3, 7, 28, 56, 90 and 120 days of hydration with cement replacement by VA and sand replacement by laterite both ranging from 0 to 30 % respectively while a control mix of 28 -day target strength of 25 N/mm 2 (using British Method) was adopted.

The amount of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) substitution in both blends was 50 %. The calcium hydroxide (Ca (OH) 2) content of the hardened pastes were determined and analysed with the aid of Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectrometry (ED-XRFS).

40|$|The {{chloride}} {{diffusion coefficient}} {{is considered to}} be a key factor for evaluating the service life of ground-granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) blended concrete. The chloride diffusion coefficient relates to both the concrete mixing proportions and <b>curing</b> <b>ages.</b> Due to the continuous hydration of the binders, the capillary porosity of the concrete decreases and the chloride diffusion coefficient also decreases over time. To date, the dependence of chloride diffusivity on the binder hydration and <b>curing</b> <b>ages</b> of slag-blended concrete has not been considered in detail. To fill this gap, this study presents a numerical procedure to predict time-dependent chloride diffusion coefficients for slag-blended concrete. First, by using a blended cement hydration model, the degree of the binder reaction for hardening concrete can be calculated. The effects of the water to binder ratios and slag replacement ratios on the degree of the binder reaction are considered. Second, by using the degree of the binder reaction, the capillary porosity of the binder paste at different <b>curing</b> <b>ages</b> can be determined. Third, by using the capillary porosity and aggregate volume, the chloride diffusion coefficients of concrete can be calculated.

All the mixtures were proportioned with a fixed aggregate / cement ratio of 4. 5.

Equations derived based on the results from the experimental work are proposed to predict the flexural strength and the compressive strength of the developed PCPBs. The effect of water cement ratio, <b>curing</b> <b>age</b> and plastic content on flexural strength and compressive strength of PCPBs was found to be statistically significant (P < 0. 0001).

The result shows that the compressive strength of the cubes at all percentage concentration of the acid decreases with <b>curing</b> <b>age.</b> Also, the percentage decrease in strength increases with both percentage of acid and <b>curing</b> <b>age.</b> Thus the rate of deterioration is highest at 60 days curing in 20 % acid concentration (47. 8 %).
