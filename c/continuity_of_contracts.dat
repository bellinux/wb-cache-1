Thus study reaches the {{following}} conclusions regarding the legal implications of EMU for transactions governed by the laws of U. S. jurisdictions, regardless of whether legislation ensuring the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> is passed in particular American jurisdictions and regardless of whether such legislation applies prospectively or retroactively. II/ 636 / 97 The legal implications of the European economic and monetary union (EMU) under the laws of New York State and other U. S. jurisdictions {{is one of the most}} important legal questions facing the international financial markets today. The Bank for International Settlements estimates that at the end of March 1995 the OTC derivatives market stood at $ 47. 5 trillion. Approximately half of all derivatives contracts worldwide are believed to be governed by New York law, including most U. S. swap contracts, up to half of the swap contracts in the London derivatives market and a significant proportion of swap contracts in other offshore financial centers (e. g., Frankfurt, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore). The Deutsche mark is the world's second most widely used currency after the U. S. dollar, and taken together the 15 currencies of the European Union and the ECU basket currency form a powerful currency bloc. Aside from the derivatives market, eurobonds denominated in EU currencies are frequently issued by U. S. corporations in offshore transactions governed by New York law. As with derivatives contracts, many of these transactions involve long-term obligations. Finally, long-term loan agreements and cross-border commercial transactions governed by the laws of U. S. jurisdictions also involve obligations denominated in EU currencies. In May 1995 the European Commission's Green Paper on the Practical Arrangements for the Introduction of the Single European Currency predicted that under the laws of non-EU jurisdictions the proposed single currency would be recognized as the successor to existing EU national currencies at the fixed conversion rates at which the single currency will substitute EU national currencies. The Commission's Green Paper thus concluded that under the laws of non-EU jurisdictions the continuity of monetary obligations and other terms of a contract such as interest rates and other ancillary obligations could be expected. This study {{will address the}} issues raised by the Commission's Green Paper. Thus study reaches the following conclusions regarding the legal implications of EMU for transactions governed by the laws of U. S. jurisdictions, regardless of whether legislation ensuring the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> is passed in particular American jurisdictions and regardless of whether such legislation applies prospectively or retroactively. All long-term debts denominated in EU currencies must be discharged in the new single European currency - the euro - at the official conversion rates at which the euro will substitute existing EU currencies. All foreign exchange transactions (e. g., FX forwards, cross currency swaps and currency options) in which an EU currency is used on one side of the transaction (e. g., a US$/DM swap) must be discharged in the euro at the applicable conversion rates. All foreign exchange transactions involving the exchange of two currencies participating in EMU (e. g., a DM/FFr swap) should also be discharged in the euro at the applicable conversion rates. In the case of contracts involving periodic payments (i. e., a cross currency interest rate swap) the economic effect will be to impose an obligation on one party to make net payments for the remaining life of the contract, similar to an annuity. It may be necessary to explore the tax implications of this with the U. S. tax authorities. All fixed interest rate obligations (including fixed rate swaps) must be discharged at the rate specified in the contract. All floating interest rate obligations linked to particular EU national currencies should be discharged in accordance with the interest rates established by successor price sources for the euro in the event that existing price sources are no longer available after EMU. Force majeure clauses used in debt transactions which call for the discharge of EU currency debts in U. S. dollars or some other currency in the event that the currency of the contract is no longer available due to circumstances beyond the party's control will not be triggered by EMU. Impossibility clauses used in debt transactions which call for the discharge of EU currency debts in U. S. dollars or some other currency in the event that the currency of the contract is no longer used by the government of the country issuing such currency should not be triggered by EMU. All obligations denominated in the ECU basket currency should be discharged in the euro at the rate of one euro for one ECU, unless the terms of the contract and the surrounding circumstances establish a clear intention to the contrary. Substantially identical legislation confirming the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> in accordance with the above principles has been proposed in the three leading U. S. trading jurisdictions â€” New York, Illinois and California. This legislation has been enacted into law in New York and Illinois. This study reaches the following conclusions with respect to this legislation. Notwithstanding certain possible discrepancies, the New York and Illinois legislation confirms the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> after EMU in a manner that is broadly consistent with the continuity regulations endorsed by the Council of the European Union. Any discrepancies between the EU Council regulations and the New York or Illinois legislation must be resolved by applying the applicable rules established under the EU Council regulations. Assuming that the New York and Illinois legislation applies retroactively, the legislation does not contravene the provisions of the United States Constitution prohibiting the states from enacting legislation that impairs the obligation of contracts. This is because state legislation confirming the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> after EMU in a manner that is broadly consistent with the EU Council regulations is declaratory of existing law and does not impair pre-existing contractual obligations in any manner. In any case, such legislation has been enacted to protect a broad societal interest (i. e., the avoidance of needless litigation after EMU), and would therefore be upheld by American courts in deference to the judgment of the state legislatures. Because the New York and Illinois legislation recognizes the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> in a manner that is broadly consistent with the monetary sovereignty of the European Union over the currencies of EU member states, the legislation does not infringe the U. S. Federal Government's undisputed authority over international monetary relations. emu, economic and monetary union, usa, legal, new york...|$|E

This Article will then focus on the EU regulations that provide the legal framework for EMU, analyzing issues in the regulations of particular legal interest. This structural discussion will also describe what Participating Members States must achieve to ensure that EMU stays on track and how EU institutions will supervise their performance. Part I closes with a brief look at the international role of the euro.

40|$|This paper recounts some {{well-known}} problems confronting European {{monetary union}} (EMU), such as withstanding asymmetric shocks and maintaining domestic political support. It then examines how a speculative attack could damage a target country’s banking system, {{and how the}} basic structure of EMU could facilitate its break-up. On the basis of this analysis, one might reasonably conclude that there is a significant chance – over one in ten – that EMU may break up in whole or in part. The paper then focuses primarily on two significant problems related to a break-up. First, a country seeking to leave EMU, particularly after the transition period, may have difficulty re-establishing its national currency unilaterally, as its economy is likely to have become thoroughly ‘euroized’. Second, any break-up accompanied by re-denomination of existing euro obligations, including government bonds, will create great legal uncertainty and costly litigation. There are no <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> rules for exiting EMU equivalent to those for entering. Both problems require cooperative and deliberative solutions and will be difficult and costly to solve. If such problems are properly taken into account, which has not previously been the case, a euro break-up in the foreseeable future, particularly after transition, is considerably less likely than the above estimate of one in ten.

40|$|One way or another, the European Monetary Union (EMU) {{is apt to}} endure. The {{prospect}} of continuation under the precise contours of the regime as we presently find it, however, is anything but certain. Hence many investors and other actual or prospective contract parties are likely to remain skittish until matters grow clearer. This skittishness, importantly, can itself hamper the {{prospect of}} expeditious European recovery. Addressing particular sources of ongoing uncertainty about EMU prospects can itself therefore aid in the project of recovery. This Essay accordingly aims to impose structure upon one particular, and indeed particularly complex, source of uncertainty now damaging EMU prospects. That {{is the matter of}} how best to defend, legally speaking, <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> in the event of some basic change in the current Euro regime. The hope is that sizing up and breaking down this question into its constituent parts might accomplish at least three related aims. One is to render the hypothetical problems raised by the question more tractable than they would otherwise be. Another is to facilitate the development of provisional plans of approach to such problems in the event they should present themselves. Finally, yet another is to afford confidence to the markets by enabling contingency planning of the sort just suggested, thereby lessening the likelihood of self-fulfilling ‘run’-like activity on European debt instruments...|$|R

The approach requires new impact assessment tools to measure changes in farm income and transaction cost, and behavioural change in value chain relationships.

Contracts between a local sorghum processor and smallholders have a central role. Trust between farmers and the processor and mutual trust in farmer groups are key success factors. The simulations indicate that the approach can lead to increased farm incomes. <b>Continuity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> system depends {{on the extent to which}} contracted farmers can be trusted not to side-sell when market prices are high.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{effectiveness}} of legislation introduced to provide <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> employment for <b>contract</b> workers in the service sector, during the sale or transfer of a business. A review of minimum standards in 2001 found that workers were materially and psychologically disadvantaged by the process <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> out. This study is about whether the subsequent law for specific service workers called <b>Continuity</b> <b>of</b> employment if employees’ work affected by restructuring achieved that outcome. Such a study has not been undertaken to date. The thesis consists of a theoretically-driven narrative, in which the practice <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> out is explored {{within the context of}} the new social democracy in New Zealand. The theory of risk society and the third way contribute to a critique of the institutionalized individualism of modern society. This critique is supported by stories from nine commercial cleaners and hospital kitchen workers who share recent experiences of a change <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> These stories serve to illustrate the effectiveness of the new law. The experiences of these workers are gathered through conversations held in interviews and focus groups and provide a link between theory, history and the reality of the frontline. The study concludes that the destiny <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> workers is tied as much to the policy nest in which the employment protection law resides, as the subsequent legislative amendment. The risk <b>of</b> disadvantage to <b>contract</b> workers is linked as much to the processes of institutionalized individualism in modern society and the freedoms incorporated into the Employment Relations Act 2000, as to the new minimum standard providing <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> employment for workers. I conclude that the existing protections for vulnerable workers are fragile and without minimum entitlements that ensure workers have the capability to access those rights, the risk of material and psychological disadvantage remains high...|$|R

Its function was to enhance command and control initiatives of the Navy and Marine Corps by harnessing the power of an integrated network. The current state of NMCI, though marred by a decade filled with marginal successes and many setbacks, is very positive, boasting more than 700, 000 users, and consisting of over 380, 000 work stations in more than 3, 000 locations dispersed over seven continents.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to rescue}} the {{tradition}} of corporation theory from the implications of ontological and ethical individualism, which form important tenets of mainstream political theory. My argument for corporate personality builds on the Lockean and Humean theory of personal identity over time. According to this theory, personal identity is not rooted in {{the identity of a}} deep and indivisible Self, but in the relatedness between temporally distinct psychological stages. A person is a group of desires, beliefs, memories, traits and other attitudes, tied together by a causal string. On the best interpretation of the Humean view, personal identity has normative consequences. We are bundles but the string that ties the stages of one life together is formed by the normativity of action-guiding principles and by the mutual recognition of certain associative obligations. This normative claim is often meant to buttress ethical individualism against those who deny that persons exist at all. However, this thesis demonstrates that the claim also reinvigorates the idea of corporate personality. The argument develops along two different strands. First, it is shown that corporate personality is a political theory. It is the theory that compares co-operative relations between people with the co-operative relations between the stages of one person. For contractualist theories, the core virtue is justice. For corporate theories, the highest virtue is integrity. Second, corporation theory makes a real contribution to the field of political theory, in particular in an area where contractualism has traditionally encountered problems, to wit, the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contract.</b> This thesis argues corporation theory is much more successful in explaining our transgenerational obligations to the past and future...|$|R
40|$|Consensus and {{commercial}} terms: theoretical and comparative analysis This final thesis {{deals with the}} topic of the battle of the forms using the theoretical apparatus of rules governing the formation <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> The problem is modeled (and therefore limited) for the case <b>of</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> for the sale of goods concluded between merchants when each of them uses his/her own commercial (standard) terms. Another limitation of the thesis is connected with the use of classical contractual paradigm which is based on the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> offer and acceptance in the process <b>of</b> <b>contracting.</b> The key element <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> is found in consensus, therefore it is consensus which is analyzed in connection with extensiveness of terms, about which the minds have to meet in order to form the contract, and also in connection with the content <b>of</b> already formed <b>contract.</b> The final thesis has two objectives. First, it is to verify on theoretical level that no matter what principle in the process <b>of</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> is used (whether mirror-image rule or not) both law professionals and legal theory are forced to find solutions which are in accordance with the principle of economic analysis <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> Second, it is to analyze solutions on the formation and content <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> which were adopted by Czech [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: <b>Continuity</b> <b>of</b> care is {{considered}} foundational to high-quality care. Traditional <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care constructs may adequately characterize care quality in general populations, but may merit reconceptualization {{for patients with}} multiple chronic conditions. Specifically, interactions between multiple chronic condition patients and providers involve complex medication management; therefore care continuity measurement may be more relevant if focused on the provider subset who prescribes essential medications for chronic conditions—a construct we call <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management. Our objective was to explore conceptual distinctions between <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management and <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care, survey existing evidence in this area, and discuss implications of our findings for future research and intervention development. Methods: In this topical review, we discuss conceptual distinctions between <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management and <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care, review the limited <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management–related empirical evidence, and discuss implications for future research and interventions. Results: <b>Continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management represents a potential conceptual and measurement advance by reflecting interpersonal continuity and management continuity, and may provide a means of identifying patients at high-risk of adverse events. Empirical evidence also establishes support for <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management as a meaningful measure <b>of</b> care <b>continuity.</b> Finally, <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management {{may also be a}} potential target for future intervention to improve care delivery among multiple chronic condition patients. Conclusion: If <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management is validated in diverse populations, correlated with patient outcomes, and responsive to change, then it may be an important target for improving the health and health care of multiple chronic condition patients...|$|R
