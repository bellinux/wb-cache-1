50|$|The van {{became popular}} as a minibus, and was {{available}} in pick-up and fleet-based vans {{as well as being}} used by the army for transporting troops.

50|$|Relative to the exterior, the {{interior}} of the LS bore a stronger resemblance to the S-Type, with a similar dashboard layout, gauges, and controls. The interior of the LS was simple, straightforward, and comfortable. Large gauges were designed to convey sportiness, while other controls, such as audio and climate controls, were positioned in the car's center stack for convenience to both the driver and the front passenger. The steering wheel could be wood- and leather-wrapped while wood accents continued around {{the interior}} on the door panels and dashboard area. Leather seating surfaces were standard and the front power bucket seats were bolstered for a firm feel like the LS' European competitors. Other standard interior features included power windows, power door locks with keyless entry, power heated mirrors, automatic headlights, air conditioning with automatic climate control, cruise control, and an AM/FM <b>cassette</b> <b>radio.</b> Some of the available options included a six-disc in-dash CD changer (only accessible through the glove box initially; changed on later models), a power moonroof, and a universal garage door opener.|$|E
50|$|Some journalists such as Private Eyes Paul Foot and a PA 103 relative, Dr Jim Swire, {{believed}} that it was too stark a coincidence for a Toshiba <b>cassette</b> <b>radio</b> IED to have downed PA 103 just eight weeks after the arrest of the PFLP-GC cell in Frankfurt. Indeed, Scottish police actually wrote up an arrest warrant for Marwan Khreesat in the spring of 1989, but were persuaded by the FBI not to issue it because of his value as an intelligence source. In the following spring, King Hussein of Jordan arranged for Khreesat to be interviewed by FBI agent, Edward Marshman, and {{the former head of the}} FBIs forensic lab, Thomas Thurman, to whom he described in detail the bombs he had built. In the 1994 documentary film Maltese Double Cross, the author David Yallop speculated that Libyan agents and agents paid by Iran may have worked on the bombing together; or, that one group handed the job over to a second group upon the arrest of the PFLP-GC cell members. The former CIA head of counter-terrorism, Vincent Cannistraro, who previously worked on the PA 103 investigation, was interviewed in the film and said he believed the PFLP-GC planned the attack at the behest of the Iranian government, then sub-contracted it to Libyan intelligence after October 1988, because the arrests in Germany meant the PFLP-GC was unable to complete the operation. Other supporters of this theory {{believed that}} whoever paid for the bombing arranged two parallel operations intended to ensure that at least one would succeed; or, that Jibrils cell in Germany was a red herring designed to attract the attention of the intelligence services, while the real bombers worked quietly elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|In mid-1986, another Ford partner, Kia Motors in South Korea began {{production}} of the Festiva under license as the [...] "Kia Pride". Starting from mid-1987 for the 1988 model year, Kia began exports to Canada under the [...] "Ford Festiva" [...] name, with United States sales commencing {{by the end of}} 1987. Ford offered a single 1.3-liter B3 four-cylinder engine and three trim levels: L, L Plus, and LX. The two base models featured a four-speed manual overdrive transmission, with the LX upgraded to a five-speed unit. A tachometer and tilt steering wheel also featured on the LX trim, as did alloy wheels, remote mirrors, cloth interior seating, and an AM/FM <b>cassette</b> <b>radio.</b> Ford released a minor facelift in North America for the 1990 model year. At the same time, the engine's fuel delivery system transitioned from carburetor to fuel injection, and transmission choices were revised with a standard five-speed manual transmission and optional three-speed automatic. Ford also replaced the manual front seat belts with motorized versions, and fitted manual rear seat belts as standard. For the 1991 model year, the L Plus and LX models were combined into a single GL trim. Optional power steering was deleted for 1992, and the GL gained alloy wheels and the availability of a [...] "sport" [...] package. The final 1993 model year brought no changes. Over the life of the Festiva in the United States, Kia exported roughly 350,000 units. The agreement with Ford materialized in accordance with Kia's strategy implemented in the mid-1980s to progressively fill the void at the low-cost end of the market slowly being abdicated by the Japanese brands pursuing more expensive models with higher profit margins. Compared to rival automakers in Japan, and also Europe and North America, Kia's main competitive advantage was its lower-paid South Korean workforce—which translated into lower-priced cars.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} these two case studies was to explore the {{effectiveness}} of learning methods in dementia when applied in real-life settings and the integration of new skills in daily life functioning. The first participant, DD, learned {{to look at a}} calendar with the spaced retrieval method to answer his repeated questions about the current date and calls made to family. Progressive cuing was used by his wife to increase spontaneous use of the calendar, but DD had difficulty integrating the calendar into his routine. The second patient, MD, relearned a leisure activity (listening to music on a <b>cassette</b> <b>radio)</b> and how to participate in a social activity (saying the rosary in a group) with a combination of learning methods. Transfer of these skills in similar contexts was difficult for MD. She never integrated the <b>cassette</b> <b>radio</b> into her daily life routine but she went regularly to the rosary activity, which was cued by an alarm clock. In sum, the learning methods used were very effective with these patients but transfer and spontaneous use were difficult. Since these aspects are essential to rehabilitation, they should be further explored in order to increase the effectiveness of cognitive interventions. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|To {{paraphrase}} a by now well-known story, back in 1975 on the West Coast of California, a {{group of}} hobbyists interested in {{the latest developments in}} electronic computers met in the garage of a suburban house to exchange stories, information and show each other the latest pieces of technology they had acquired and the adaptations they had made to the same. This was the Homebrew Computer Club. One of the early computers scrutinised by this congregation was a mail order do-it-yourself kit for the Altair 8800, which had featured as the cover story of the January issue of Popular Electronics. It was a fairly basic machine –just a simple steel box with a number of toggle switches and LED lights which, when assembled, allowed the user to do nothing more than use the toggle switches to programme the computer to make the lights flash as it counted in binary and performed mathematical calculations. One member of the club, a certain Steve Wozniak who had been building electronic projects of his own since elementary school, saw this as an unacceptable state of affairs, and thought that he could build something much better. In six months, using the cheapest microprocessor chip on the market, Wozniak developed a computer that used a keyboard to enable programming and a television monitor as an output. With his friend Steve Jobs he founded the company Apple Computer Inc. in 1976, used Steve Jobs’ parents’ garage as the company’s headquarters, and sold the components for around 175 of the Apple I computer in kit form. It was a well-received product, despite owners having to make wooden cases for the computer themselves. Using the money from selling these kits, the two Steve’s went on to design and produce a more commercial and hugely successful machine, the Apple][(or Apple II as it became known) in 1977, just in time for Apple to become a major force in the explosion of the home computer market that occurred that year. Numerous detailed academic and mainstream accounts of the birth and history of Apple Computers have been written over the years, and whole books have even been written about individual products, particularly the ground-breaking Apple Macintosh of 1984. This level of media attention has accompanied every step of Apple’s progress on its route to becoming the largest and most profitable technology corporation the world has ever seen. For a company that is notoriously secretive, there is a huge amount of information out there about every product they have ever sold, ranging from official corporate press releases, journalistic coverage in newspapers and magazines, academic analyses in books and journals and user opinion on numerous blogs. This has been rendered possible largely because of the unprecedented rationalisation of their product portfolio. As an example, let us take a particular point in time. In 2001, Apple launched the iPod – a device which, although not employing any new technology, nevertheless completely altered the way vast numbers of people engage with music. At the time of its release on the 23 rd of October, the official Apple website displayed the company’s complete range of hardware as: the iPod, the iMac, the Power Mac G 4, the G 4 server, the iBook, the PowerBook G 4, the 22 ” Cinema Display monitor, the 17 ” and 15 ” Studio Display monitors, the Apple Pro mouse, Apple Pro keyboard and the Airport modem. That’s it. A mere 12 products produced and sold globally. It is a radically minimalist approach indicative of Apple, and one which is completely in line with the aesthetics of the company’s design philosophy. A highly considered output of very refined products, each eagerly anticipated by and released with huge fanfare to an enormous fan base of ‘Macolytes’. And every time a product is released it is immediately splashed across every newspaper and magazine; dissected, analysed and discussed at length on innumerable websites, with every strength and weakness highlighted through social media. It is the kind of exposure and reverence that has allowed every product that Apple has ever produced to become a collectible piece of design history, documented and indexed to from part of a coherent, manageable timeline of production and consumption that could be, and indeed to a large part has been, pragmatically displayed in a single exhibition with an appropriately considered catalogue. This is not the usual state of affairs. Compare the output of Apple with just one of its competitors. At almost exactly the same time, Sony, a similarly global corporation selling similarly priced high-end technology, had a significantly larger product portfolio. On the 13 th December 2001 the Sony UK website listed 25 different product categories including TV, Video, Hi-Fi, Home Entertainment, Walkman, Playstation, Portable <b>Cassette,</b> <b>Radio,</b> Computers, Vaio Notebooks, Clie Handheld Computers and so on. Within just one of these categories, Vaio Notebooks, there were seven different series of Notebooks listed, each containing between one and seven products. A total of 36 discrete models of laptop – three times the number of products produced by Apple across their complete product range. And that is just for one of the 25 product categories, each of which contained a similarly sized or larger range of products; and that website only covered the United Kingdom. The global site listed 55 separate countries, each of which had its own individual website, each containing different ranges of country specific models of their products. In short, and in sharp contrast to Apple, it is to all intents and purposes impossible to compile a complete list of technology products emanating from a single corporation such as Sony at any particular point in time, let alone any kind of complete historical picture of all technological products. The point of this comparison is to highlight one of the main problems of researching any aspect of the design history of modern technology – the sheer amount of different products produced and discarded year upon year by companies such as Sony, Philips, Hewlett-Packard, Fujitsu and numerous other well-known global brands. In itself an incalculable amount of production, yet likely dwarfed by the combined output of an enormous number of much smaller, less well-known competitors producing lower quality, cheaper, ‘me too’ products. After all, if two guys in a garage can change the world, surely anyone can do it...|$|E
