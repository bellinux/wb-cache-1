40|$|Abstract: A {{description}} of the one-loop approximation formula for the partition function of a three-dimensional abelian version of the Donaldson-Witten theory is proposed. The one-loop expression is shown to contain such topological invariants of a threedimensional manifold M like the Reidemeister-Ray-Singer torsion τR and Betti numbers. 1. In three dimensions (3 d), traditionally, we have the two important well-known topological quantum field theories (of “cohomological ” type) : non-abelian SU(2) topological gauge theory of flat connection and 3 <b>d</b> <b>version</b> of the topological Seiberg-Witten theory. The former is a 3 d twisted N = 4 SUSY SU(2) pure gauge theory or a 3 <b>d</b> <b>version</b> of the Donaldson-Witten theory, and “by definition ” it describes the Casson invariant, which appropriately (i. e. with sign) counts the number of flat SU(2) connections [1]. The latter is a dimensional reduction of the topological Seiberg-Witten theory or a twisted <b>version</b> of 3 <b>d</b> N = 4 SUSY U(1) gauge theory with a matter hypermultiplet [2], [3]. Also this theory describes an interesting non-trivial topological invariant of 3 d manifolds pertaining to 3 d Donaldson-Witten invariant which has been conjectured to be equivalent to already known topological invariants and in particular to topological (Reidemeister) torsion [4]...|$|R

40|$|Today {{we often}} use term ‘authentic’ in {{relation}} to different appearances of Georgian folk music. Along with the unambiguous meaning ‘real’ this term also has other meanings: ‘ethnic’, ‘rural’, ‘old’, ‘function of usual environment’, ‘traditional-stylistic’, ‘authoritative’, or ‘reproductive’. In spite of some interconnections that arise from the term ‘authentic’ and its other meanings, the most relevant way to apply this popular term for performers and audiences of ‘real folklore’ is traditionality. This factor is manifested in the following contexts: a) performer (receiver and distributor of tradition, unobtrusively and orally), b) motivation/function (representative and spontaneous function, hereditary, utilitarian and aesthetic-daily motivation), c) repertoire (compliance of musical and verbal text’s sample with its social function, eluding canonized <b>versions),</b> <b>d)</b> expression (adequate articulation, performing regulation which is not determined by the stage, traditional instrument etc.). The problem of authenticity is more successfully regulated in traditional Georgian church music than in folk music. For the latter, in this regard the special difficulty is caused by identification of modern trends that contain folk motifs. The most popular among them is distinctive, with its stylistic reminiscent layer from the Eastern Georgian Mountains, which we refer as ‘para-folkore’. Notwithstanding the fact that Georgian folklore is not centrally authorized, modernization of folklore samples and also those manifestations of post-folklore that are further away from the traditional motifs attract {{a wide range of}} listeners. Essentially, the meaning of ‘authentic’ in the Georgian ethno-musical context is presented as performance of the traditional rural repertoire with traditional articulation. However, we think that it is convenient for the criteria of traditional, usual environment to be added to this perspective...|$|R

40|$|<b>Version</b> 2 <b>d,</b> June 2008 It is {{well known}} that {{dielectric}} absorption plays a critical role in determining the accuracy of analog sampled-data systems that are based on charge storage, such as sampleand-holds and switched-capacitor ADCs. Less appreciated, but no less important, is the role it plays in determining the quality factor, or Q, of the capacitor. Dielectric absorption has both storage and loss components that act, and are significant, over the entire usable frequency range of the capacitor. Along with background information on the origins of dielectric absorption, this paper presents two models for a capacitor that exhibits dielectric absorption. The first is the relatively well known model proposed by Dow. The second is a model with relatively little exposure that is based on the dielectric permittivity model of Cole and Cole. This model has fewer parameters than the Dow model and is predictive over a very broad range of frequencies...|$|R

40|$|Data {{transfer}} means transferring {{data fields}} from a sender to a receiver. It {{is a fundamental}} and frequently used operation of a <b>coupler.</b> Most <b>versions</b> of state-of-the-art <b>couplers</b> currently use an implementation based on the point-to-point (P 2 P) communication of the message passing interface (MPI) (referred to as “P 2 P implementation” hereafter). In this paper, we reveal the drawbacks of the P 2 P implementation when the parallel decompositions of the sender and the receiver are different, including low communication bandwidth due to small message size, variable and high number of MPI messages, as well as network contention. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a butterfly implementation for data transfer. Although the butterfly implementation outperforms the P 2 P implementation in many cases, it degrades the performance when the sender and the receiver have similar parallel decompositions or {{when the number of}} processes used for running models is small. To ensure data transfer with optimal performance, we design and implement an adaptive data transfer library that combines the advantages of both butterfly implementation and P 2 P implementation. As the adaptive data transfer library automatically uses the best implementation for data transfer, it outperforms the P 2 P implementation in many cases while it does not decrease the performance in any cases. Now, the adaptive data transfer library {{is open to the public}} and has been imported into the C-Coupler 1 coupler for performance improvement of data transfer. We believe that other couplers can also benefit from this...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A set of new {{canonical}} {{variables for}} d = 11 supergravity is proposed which renders the supersymmetry variations and the supersymmetry constraint polynomial. The construction {{is based on}} the SO(1, 2) × SO(16) invariant reformulation of d = 11 supergravity given in [4], and has some similarities with Ashtekar’s reformulation of Einstein’s theory. The new bosonic variables fuse the gravitational degrees of freedom with those of the three-index photon AMNP in accordance with the hidden symmetries of the dimensionally reduced theory. Although E 8 is not a symmetry of the theory, the bosonic sector exhibits a remarkable E 8 structure, hinting at the existence of a novel type of “exceptional geometry”. Recent advances in string theory (see e. g. [1]) have lent renewed support to the long held belief that d = 11 supergravity [2] has a fundamental role to play in the unification of fundamental interactions.
