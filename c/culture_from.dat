40|$|Using our {{in vitro}} model, we {{previously}} demonstrated the variable effects of different glucocorticoids on cultures of hemangioma biopsies from two patients. The {{present study was}} designed to investigate the effects of five commonly used glucocorticoids administered to <b>cultures</b> <b>from</b> the hemangioma biopsies of three patients at different concentrations and at different time points of culture. Interindividual variation in the effects of glucocorticoids on capillary growth was observed. Triamcinolone 12 µM inhibited capillary growth in <b>cultures</b> <b>from</b> two out of three patients. Triamcinolone 4 µM stimulated <b>cultures</b> <b>from</b> all patients tested. Dexamethasone 12 µM inhibited <b>cultures</b> <b>from</b> all patients. Up to day 9, dexamethasone 4 µM inhibited <b>cultures</b> <b>from</b> all patients tested. Methylprednisolone 12 µM and 4 µM had little inhibitory effect on <b>cultures</b> derived <b>from</b> all 360 three patients. Betamethasone 12 µM inhibited <b>cultures</b> <b>from</b> two patients but stimulated <b>cultures</b> <b>from</b> another. Betamethasone 4 µM inhibited <b>cultures</b> <b>from</b> all patients tested. Hydrocortisone 12 µM inhibited <b>cultures</b> <b>from</b> one patient and had a variable effect on <b>cultures</b> <b>from</b> the other two. Hydrocortisone 4 µM inhibited <b>cultures</b> <b>from</b> all patients tested until day 9, when <b>cultures</b> <b>from</b> one patient were stimulated. These in vitro results indicate that dexamethasone may be the steroid of choice for treating hemangioma as it exhibits the least interindividual variation. Some of the factors considered important for hemangiogenesis were examined. Transcription of fibroblast growth factor- 2 was variably affected by different steroids. Transcripts of interleukin- 6 were decreased by all glucocorticoids at all concentrations. Transcription of transforming growth factor-...|$|R

5|$|Beetles are {{prominent}} in human <b>culture,</b> <b>from</b> the sacred scarabs of ancient Egypt to beetlewing art and use as pets or fighting insects for entertainment and gambling. Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects of collection and decorative displays. Over 300 species {{are used as}} food, mostly as larvae; species widely consumed include mealworms and rhinoceros beetle larvae. However, the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural pests. Serious pests include the boll weevil of cotton, the Colorado potato beetle, the coconut hispine beetle, and the mountain pine beetle. Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the lady beetles and dung beetles are beneficial by helping to control insect pests.|$|E
5|$|Caregivers use {{language}} {{to help children}} become competent members of society and <b>culture.</b> <b>From</b> birth, infants receive pragmatic information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children with information about words and phrases. Caregivers find many ways to help infants interact and respond. As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly. Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, {{and how they can}} stay on topic. Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.|$|E

5|$|The {{symbolism}} of the garden, particularly of the carvings, {{as well as the}} repetition of sevens and threes, has inspired many interpretations. The engravings upon which the carvings are based were commonplace in Scotland at the time, and were frequently used in the art of memory, a mnemonic memory technique associated with Freemasonry. The art of memory had become a feature throughout Scottish <b>culture,</b> <b>from</b> the court of Queen Anne, Danish consort of James VI, to the lodges of operative stonemasons. The potential influence of Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe's symbolic garden at Uraniborg, which was visited by James IV of Scotland in 1590, has also been noted.|$|E

40|$|IgM-rheumatoid factor (RF) {{is thought}} to be {{involved}} in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Several cytokines are known to regulate immunoglobulin synthesis. In this study the effects of IL- 2 on polyclonal IgM and IgM RF synthesis were compared. Cytokines were added to peripheral blood B cells from normal subjects and patients with RA after activation by Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 (SAC). The addition of IL- 2, but not IL- 4 or IL- 6, resulted in significant enhancement of IgM synthesis in <b>cultures</b> <b>from</b> both healthy subjects and patients with RA. Similar degrees of enhancement were seen in both peripheral blood mononuclear cell and highly purified B cell cultures. IgM-RF was synthesized after activation in <b>cultures</b> <b>from</b> healthy subjects and spontaneously in <b>cultures</b> <b>from</b> RA patients. In contrast to polyclonal IgM synthesis, IL- 2 failed to augment IgM-RF synthesis in cell <b>cultures</b> <b>from</b> either healthy subjects or RA patients.

5|$|A {{settlement}} and cemetery of the Lengyel-Polgár cultural zone, dated around or after 4600 BCE, {{was discovered in}} Ślęza, Wrocław County. It consisted of a central long trapezoidal house accompanied by several post-built supporting structures. Among the large explored settlements of the Lengyel <b>culture</b> <b>from</b> the 4400-4000 BCE period, there is one in Brześć Kujawski, and another one in Osłonki, solidly fortified about 4200 BCE after an assault incident involving arson and murder, both located in the Kujawy region. At the Osłonki settlement nearly 30 trapezoidal houses and over 80 graves were located, some of them with many copper ornaments. The agricultural and construction activities of the communities centered on the two large settlements (hunting and fishing were also practiced) caused very likely an accumulation of environmental damage, which eventually forced them to abandon the area. 4th millennium BC constructions reinforced with ditches and palisades and ceramics molded into figural representations of the Lengyel-Polgár culture were located in Podłęże, Wieliczka County.|$|E
5|$|Drawings {{scratched}} on slate {{have been}} found of dragon-prowed ships, portraits {{of an old man}} and of a young, bearded man and of a four-legged animal.

Similarly, although the rectangular shape of the Norse-era buildings are quite unlike the earlier rounded Pictish style, the basement courses of the two periods are constructed in the same way.

Spleen cells from normal control mice formed readily detectable levels of antibody, as well as specific antibody plaque-forming cells, after similar stimulation with antigen either in vivo or in vitro. The absence of antibody-forming cells in <b>cultures</b> prepared <b>from</b> spleens of tolerant mice was specific since such cultures, as well as those from normal control mice, formed numerous antibody plaques to unsensitized sheep erythrocytes in vitro after in vivo challenge of the mice with sheep erythrocytes. Tolerance to Shigella antigen, as assessed by absence of antibody-forming cells in vitro, persisted for several months. Spleen cell <b>cultures</b> <b>from</b> tolerant mice less than 3 to 4 months of age did not form significant numbers of antibody plaques, even after in vitro exposure to specific antigen. However, spleen <b>cultures</b> prepared <b>from</b> neonatally treated mice, approximately 6 to 8 months old, formed essentially normal numbers of specific PFC in vitro, indicating that the animals had “recovered” from tolerance and that their lymphoid cells were capable of responding to Shigella antigen in vitro. Absence of specific PFC in cell <b>cultures</b> <b>from</b> tolerant animals supports the concept that tolerance is due to a central failure of specific immunocompetent cells and not due to an inhibitory effect caused by either “excess” antigen or humoral antibody...|$|R
