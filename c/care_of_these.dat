25|$|However {{most people}} have little idea {{how to go about}} doing many of these things. How can the average user with no {{training}} be expected to know how to run their own network security (especially as things are getting more complicated all the time)?

50|$|The Mahalwari {{system of}} land revenue worked under {{the scheme of}} 1833 was {{completed}} under the administration of James Thompson. The 66% rental demanded proved very harsh, too. In the Saharanpur Rules of 1855, it was revised to 50% by Lord Dalhousie. However, the British officers hardly <b>cared</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> rules. This created widespread discontent among the Indians.|$|R

25|$|In March 2009 a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the U.S. Senate, 565 and in the House, H.R. 1458 that will extend Medicare coverage of the drugs {{for as long as the}} patient has a functioning transplant. This means that patients who have lost their jobs and insurance will not also lose their kidney and be forced back on dialysis. Dialysis is currently using up $17 billion yearly of Medicare funds and total <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> patients amounts to over 10% of the entire Medicare budget.|$|E

Preventive care is the best method of preserving human remains in the long term, as active conservation work should be limited both by conservators' policy to interfere as little as possible and the beliefs of many indigenous tribes and groups who disapprove of altering human remains.|$|E
25|$|In {{the debates}} one issue was {{especially}} important: {{the treatment of}} 26,000 asylum seekers which had been in legal procedures for over five years. The left-wing opposition parties PvdA, SP, GL and CU, joined by former coalition-partner D66 wanted a general pardon for this group, granting them all a residence permit. The CDA, VVD and the smaller right-wing parties of Geert Wilders and Marco Pastors opposed such a permit because it would attract illegal immigrants. Minister Verdonk claimed that she had actually already taken <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> 26,000 asylum seekers, sending many back to their own country and granting many a residence permit.|$|E
25|$|Regarding health care, Ron Paul {{said that}} “managed care isn’t working” and that “drug {{companies}} lobby for managed care”. Paul said, “We could take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> poor people if we weren’t {{trying to maintain}} an empire overseas”. Ron Paul hit continued {{to discuss the issue}} of military non-interventionism, “70% of Americans want war over with and {{are sick and tired of}} big government at home and overseas”. They want their “civil liberties and not allow government to spend endlessly and bankrupt us”. Paul also answered questions related to his experience with Medicaid and endorsed allowing civil unions for same-sex couples country-wide, with marriage itself handled solely by religious institutions.|$|E

25|$|Ramakrishna Paramahamsa (1836–1886), {{regarded}} as a 19th-century saint, was the inspirator of the Ramakrishna Order of monks and is {{regarded as}} the spiritual founder of the Ramakrishna Movement. Ramakrishna was a priest in the Dakshineswar Kali Temple and attracted several monastic and householder disciples. Narendranath Dutta, who later became Vivekananda was one of the chief monastic disciples. According to Vrajaprana, shortly before his death in 1886 Ramakrishna gave the ochre cloths to his young disciples, who were planning to become renunciates. Ramakrishna entrusted the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> young boys to Vivekananda. After Ramakrishna's death, the young disciples of Ramakrishna gathered and practised spiritual disciplines. They took informal monastic vows on a night which to their pleasant surprise {{turned out to be the}} Christmas Eve in 1886.|$|E
25|$|This {{department}} {{has to keep}} a register of {{all members of the}} secular and regular clergy of the city, giving the name, age, residence, kind of employment and other personal notes. The vicar is aided in the settlement of all matters regarding the clergy by the examiners of the clergy, in the settlement of questions as to the transfer or deposition of parish priests by the consultors, in all questions as to offices and benefices by the general supervisory council, the deputies for the seminaries and the advisory council (commissio directiva). Detailed regulations are given as to the examiners of the clergy in paragraph 30, a to i. The second section of this department is charged with the supreme direction and supervision of the numerous convents for women; the details are regulated in seven paragraphs. Paragraphs 38–46 are concerned with the schools, colleges, and other educational institutions for the laity. The <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> is the duty of the third section. Its secretary must keep an exact list of all such institutions, of their teachers and principals, and exact statistics respecting the pupils. He must attend the meetings of the school board, keep its minutes, and must execute all the orders of the vicar or the supervisory council respecting these institutions. Paragraphs 47–57 regulate in detail the work of the fourth section, which has under its charge the brotherhoods, unions, and social societies. It consists of a council of six members with a secretary of its own.|$|E

[...] Carney selected Admiral Jerauld Wright, who relieved McCormick on April 12, 1954.|$|E
2500|$|Further, {{this too}} should be said. Anyone who asserts that god exists either says that god {{takes care of}} the things in the cosmos or that he does not, and, if he does take care, that it is either of all things or of some. Now if he takes care of everything, there would be no {{particular}} evil thing and no evil in general in the but the Dogmatists say that everything is full of evil; therefore god shall not be said to take care of everything. On the other hand, if he takes care of only some things, why does he take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> and not of those? For either he wishes but is not able, or he is able but does not wish, or he neither wishes nor is able. If he both wished and was able, he would have taken care of everything; but, for the reasons stated above, he does not take care of everything; therefore, it is not the case that he both wishes and is {{able to take care of}} everything. But if he wishes and is not able, he is weaker than the cause on account of which he is not able to take care of the things of which he does not take care; but it is contrary to the concept of god that he should be weaker than anything. Again, if he is able to take care of everything but does not wish to do so, he will be considered malevolent, and if he neither wishes nor is able, he is both malevolent and weak; but to say that about god is impious. Therefore, god does not take care of the things in the cosmos.|$|E

40|$|The {{provision}} <b>of</b> spiritual <b>care</b> {{palliative care}} has log roots stretching {{back to the}} early religious communities. However, the spirituality and spiritual care practiced in the 21 st century, while capturing the selfless <b>caring</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> early hospices and the holistic <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the modern hospice movement, is a much more structured and accountable area <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> The struggle for a definition of spirituality and the debate in nursing and medical journals throughout the 1990 s have influenced a sea change in thinking, and the spiritual care that was once thought impossible to put into words or be audited and measured has come of age for the new millennium. A key factor in the change has been the clear and focused understanding within palliative care that spiritual care is not an optional extra; rather it is an integral aspect <b>of</b> holistic <b>care</b> that comes into sharp focus for patients, families/carers and health professionals when faced with a life-threatening illness and the process of dying...|$|R
