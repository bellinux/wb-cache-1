During the first night, {{as he and his}} father wait in line, he watches a lorry deliver its load of <b>children</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fire. While his father recites the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead—Wiesel writes that in the long history of the Jews, he does not know whether people have ever recited the prayer for the dead for themselves—Eliezer considers throwing himself against the electric fence.|$|E
5|$|Differences between Rama Rao and Varalakshmi {{due to the}} latter's tantrums, also occurred. When Varalakshmi {{refused to}} touch Rama Rao's feet in the scene in which his father drags him from the {{marriage}} hall, Prasad asked Nagi Reddy's son B. L. N. Prasad—the second assistant cameraman working under Bartley—to wear a dhoti and stand before her. Chakrapani liked a scene in a play in which a group of police officers in ascending hierarchy, each junior gave up his chair for the senior; he used the same idea in Savitri's marriage sequences in the film. Similarly, Prasad incorporated part of a stage play enacted by <b>children</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> film, which Nagi Reddy's son Venkatarami Reddy was a part of. Prasad also made a cameo appearance in the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{were determined}} that the show be respectful of audience expectations for the Horrible Histories brand, maintaining its familiar visual style and content as far as possible. Early concepts for bringing it to the screen involved framing or interpretive devices, including a ghostly train carrying <b>children</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> past, or a wizard storyteller to act as their guide. Eventually Bradley with producer/director Dominic Brigstocke concluded that the material {{was strong enough to}} stand on its own, so they developed, in consultation with CBBC executives, a live-action sketch-comedy showcase. Once the writing was underway, the producers further discovered that sticking as closely as possible to the historical truth made it easier for them to find the humour within it. They then introduced a comedy style relying on parodies of familiar modern media conventions as a means of making these historical details more immediately accessible.|$|E

25|$|Vietnam is a {{destination}} country {{for children who}} are subjected to forced sexual labor and labor trafficking. Children from rural areas of the country are brought into major cities where through threats and debt-bondage are forced into the sex trade, begging industry, and industrial sectors. With Vietnam being {{a destination}} for child sex tourism, the large demand gives traffickers incentives to recruit <b>children</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trade.|$|E

This was despite the registration starting only {{in the morning of}} 30 August. Phase 3 registration is meant for foreigners who do not have Singapore permanent residency, though citizens and permanent residents who have yet to secure a place could also apply.

Helms was, of course, very non-committal politically. He played tennis. This marriage came to an end in 1967. Later Helms married Cynthia McKelvie, originally from England. She would write two books, both of which included her public experiences during their long marriage.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} of evacuating these difficult to defend zones was considered, but {{the policy of}} Haganah was set by David Ben-Gurion. He stated that 'what the Jewish people have has to be conserved. No Jewish person should abandon his or her house, farm, kibbutz or job without authorization. Every outpost, every colony, whether it is isolated or not, must be occupied {{as though it were}} Tel Aviv itself. No Jewish settlement was evacuated until the invasion of May 1948.

25|$|The use of {{coercion}} by perpetrators and traffickers {{involves the use}} of extreme control. Perpetrators expose the victim to high amounts of psychological stress induced by threats, fear, and physical and emotional violence. Tactics {{of coercion}} are reportedly used in three phases of trafficking: recruitment, initiation, and indoctrination. During the initiation phase, traffickers use foot-in-the-door techniques of persuasion to lead their victims into various trafficking industries. This manipulation creates an environment where the victim becomes completely dependent upon the authority of the trafficker. Traffickers take advantage of family dysfunction, homelessness, and history of childhood abuse to psychologically manipulate women and <b>children</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trafficking industry.|$|E
25|$|The 1834 Poor Law defined {{who could}} receive {{monetary}} relief. The act reflected and perpetuated prevailing gender conditions. In Edwardian society, men were {{the source of}} wealth. The law restricted relief for unemployed, able-bodied male workers, due to the prevailing view that they would find work {{in the absence of}} financial assistance. However, women were treated differently. After the Poor Law was passed, women and children received most of the aid. The law did not recognise single independent women, and lumped women and <b>children</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> same category. If a man was physically disabled, his wife was also treated as disabled under the law. Unmarried mothers were sent to the workhouse, receiving unfair social treatment such as being restricted from attending church on Sundays. During marriage disputes women often lost the rights to their children, even if their husbands were abusive.|$|E

25|$|On February 15, 1858, a {{group of}} 151 Icarians took {{possession}} {{of a few hundred}} acres in Cheltenham, St. Louis, Missouri. These Cabetists used Cabet's money and put down $500 on a $25,000 mortgage for thirty-nine acres and three buildings southwest of this city. Adjusting to a new area and new locals was difficult, but the Icarians adopted a constitution, a replica of the Nauvoo one, worked in the city, and enrolled their <b>children</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> local public schools. The colony quickly fell into various arguments. During the Civil War, many young men joined the Union cause. By 1864, only about twenty residents remained on the property. For the rest of the people, epidemics of dysentery and cholera occurred in the warmer months. Because the Icarians could not meet the mortgage payments, in March 1864, Arsène Sauva returned the keys to the property to St. Louis banker Thomas Allen (from whom the property had been purchased in 1858), leaving a large debt. That same year, most members left the community, and the Cheltenham Icaria was no longer extant.|$|E

Margie Thomson of The New Zealand Herald commented that [...] "it's interesting, although light, and should keep smart-alecky kids and the truly curious happy and occupied for some time." [...] The Sacramento Bees Judy Green was also positive, saying that it [...] "comes across as smart fun just begging for a trivia game. It's {{a great way to}} spend time with Harry while waiting for the next novel." [...] The Times Sarah Johnson said [...] "this irresistibly dippable book gently draws <b>children</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> joys of works of reference and is also a glorious tribute to Rowling's work." ...|$|E

If Sabal was placed in charge, he brutally executes all of Amita's supporters and turns Bhadra into Tarun Matara, a religious symbol for the country to rally around.

500|$|The Walks were well-maintained {{during the}} reign of William III, {{although}} the Inn's lack of prosperity made more improvements impossible. In 1711 the gardener was ordered not to admit [...] "any women or <b>children</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Walkes", and in 1718 was given permission to physically remove those he found. At the end of the 18th century Charles Lamb said that the Walks were [...] "the best gardens of any of the Inns of Court, their aspect being altogether reverend and law-abiding". In 1720 the old gate was replaced by [...] "a pair of handsome iron gates with peers and other proper imbellishments". The 19th and 20th centuries saw few major changes, apart from the introduction of plane trees into the Walks.|$|E

They've had writers work on it since then." [...] Josh Cooley and Meg LeFauve were credited as co-writers of the screenplay following their contributions during the rewrite. Like Docter, Cooley and LeFauve included experiences with raising their own <b>children</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> screenplay. Cooley said [...] "... we treated the emotions like parents for Riley and because {{all of us in the}} writing room are parents ourselves, we just reflected on our own experiences as parents to create the characters."

Louise and her siblings were under the care of their governess Fraulein von Wolzogen, a friend of their mother's. When Louise was only six years old, her mother died in childbirth, leaving a permanent mark on the young duchess; she would often give away pocket change to other children who experienced similar losses, stating [...] "she is like me, she has no mother". After Duchess Friederike's death, the family left Leineschloss for Herrenhausen, sometimes called a [...] "miniature Versailles". Duke Charles remarried two years later to his first wife's younger sister Charlotte, producing a son, Charles. Louise and her new stepmother became close until Charlotte's early death the year after their marriage. [...] The twice widowed and grieving duke went to Darmstadt, where he gave the <b>children</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> care of his mother-in-law and Louise's godmother, the widowed Landgravine Marie Louise.|$|E
