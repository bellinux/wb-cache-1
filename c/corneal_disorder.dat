50|$|While {{refractive}} surgery {{is becoming more}} affordable and safe, {{it may not be}} recommended for everybody. People with certain eye diseases involving the cornea or retina, pregnant women, and patients who have medical conditions such as glaucoma, diabetes, uncontrolled vascular disease, or autoimmune disease are not good candidates for {{refractive surgery}}. Keratoconus, a progressive thinning of the cornea, is a common <b>corneal</b> <b>disorder.</b> Keratoconus occurring after refractive surgery is called Corneal Ectasia. It is believed that additional thinning of the cornea via refractive surgery may contribute to advancement of the disease that may lead to the need for a corneal transplant. Therefore, keratoconus is a contraindication to refractive surgery. Corneal topography and pachymetry are used to screen for abnormal corneas. Furthermore, some people's eye shape may not permit effective refractive surgery without removing excessive amounts of corneal tissue. Those considering laser eye surgery should have a full eye examination.|$|E

The experimental rats were intravenously injected with fucoxanthin at doses of 0. 5, 5 mg/kg body weight/day or with a vehicle before UVB irradiation. Lissamine green for corneal surface staining showed that UVB irradiation caused serious damage on the corneal surface, including severe epithelial exfoliation and deteriorated epithelial smoothness.

However, pretreatment with fucoxanthin inhibited UVB radiation-induced <b>corneal</b> <b>disorders</b> including evident preservation of corneal surface smoothness, downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression, and decrease of infiltrated polymorphonuclear leukocytes from UVB-induced damage.

40|$|Keratoconus is a <b>corneal</b> <b>disorder</b> {{in which}} the cornea becomes {{cone-shaped}} due to stromal thinning and corneal weakening. It mainly affects young individuals and although the prevalence is low (1 : 2000), the impact on {{quality of life is}} high. Despite much effort, still no cure has been found for keratoconus. Although it does not cure keratoconus, CXL can be considered a revolutionary contribution, since it is the only treatment option for progressive cases. CXL is a relatively low invasive procedure to increase corneal rigidity. The treatment is performed a follows: after epithelial removal, isotonic riboflavin drops are applied to the cornea for 30 minutes and subsequently ultraviolet-A irradiation starts for 30 minutes. Reasons to remove the epithelium are that it acts a barrier for riboflavin molecules to enter the stroma, in addition to the fact that epithelium absorbs UV light. Due to the removal of epithelium, patients sensate (sometimes intensive) pain during the first postoperative hours, which extinguishes in the next day(s). Other known symptoms are blurry vision and photofobia. Complete healing of the corneal epithelium is generally within 5 days, and the risk of early post-operative complications (3 - 8...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the possible {{role of the}} VSX 1 gene {{in a group of}} patients from the Indian subcontinent with keratoconus. Methods: Molecular analysis of 66 patients with a diagnosis of keratoconus, based on clinical examination and corneal topography, was carried out. DNA extraction from peripheral blood followed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of the VSX 1 gene was performed. The entire coding region and the exon–intron junctions of the VSX 1 gene were analyzed by direct sequencing. Results: A novel change at c. 525 G>C, replacing amino acid glutamine at position 175 with histidine, was found in one affected individual. One of the previously reported SNPs (rs 12480307) was found with equal frequency in both patients and controls. Conclusions: This is the first report from the Indian subcontinent exploring the role of VSX 1 in the causation of keratoconus.

In the present work we genotyped 5 polymorphisms of 4 BER genes in 284 patients and 353 controls. The A/A genotype of the c. – 1370 T>A polymorphism of the DNA polymerase γ (POLG) gene was associated with increased occurrence of KC, while the A/T genotype was associated with decreased occurrence of KC.

40|$|Bullous keratopathy, {{the leading}} cause for corneal transplantation, is a painful end-stage <b>corneal</b> <b>disorder</b> of {{numerous}} ocular conditions caused by endothelial decom-pensation. Normally the corneal endothelium regulates stromal hydration through its ion pumping function, but in conditions such as aging, trauma, intraocular lens im-plantation, corneal graft failure, endothelial dystrophy, absolute glaucoma, chronic contact lens wear, or decrease of endothelial cell density and pumping function, the cor-neal stroma becomes edematous with bullae formation [1]. Clinical features of bullous keratopathy can vary from se-vere vision loss caused by stromal edema and subepithelial scarring to symptoms such as pain, foreign body sensation, photophobia, and epiphora due to the formation and rup-ture of blisters [2, 3]. Currently, penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) is the defini-tive treatment for bullous keratopathy [4 - 6].

30|$|The surface {{wettability}} is {{an index}} of affinity between a liquid and a solid surface [1]. Because this index depends on the functional groups of surfaces, contaminants adhered on a surface, or surface roughness, the wettability value is useful for assessing physical and chemical properties. Especially, bio-surfaces such as biomaterials and cellular tissues are important targets for wettability assessment, because bio-surfaces interact with other materials via both physical and chemical interaction [21]. For example, temperature responsive cell culture dishes are important biomaterials for fabricating cell sheets based on the wettability change on the dishes obtained by controlling the surface temperature [4, 13, 23]. Such cell sheet technologies are applicable to regenerative medicine for the malfunction of various organs and tissues [2, 3, 5 – 7, 11, 12, 15]. Regarding cellular tissues, one possible application could be in treatment of dry eye syndrome; this is a <b>corneal</b> <b>disorder</b> wherein the corneal surface loses its tear film because of less secretion of tears and/or wettability loss on the corneal surface [10]. In analysis of disease occurrence, in vitro systems which use cell culture dishes are often used. Therefore, the wettability assessment method applicable to cell culture dish systems is in high demand.|$|E
