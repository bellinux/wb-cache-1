5000|$|West Africans {{from the}} region of modern-day Liberia and Sierra Leone have used iron as a trading good and {{standard}} of value for a long time. Portuguese records indicated that sailing voyages in the early sixteenth century <b>carried</b> iron <b>bars</b> among the trade good going farther north. During {{the period of the}} slave trade in the region, iron bars were a standard of payment and wealth. [...] There {{is no reason to believe}} that these items were shaped as the kissi penny was. Rather it seems that the currency began being manufactured in the specific form of the kissi penny around 1880.|$|R
50|$|Serinettes {{are housed}} in a wooden case, {{normally}} of walnut, and typically measuring 265 × 200 × 150 mm. The instrument is played by turning a crank mounted on the front. The crank pumps a bellows to supply air to the pipes, and also turns a wooden barrel by means of gears. Driven into the barrel are brass pins and staples with which the pieces of music are encoded. Mounted over the barrel is a <b>bar</b> <b>carrying</b> wooden keys connected to valves by vertical wooden rods. As the barrel turns, the pins and staples lift the keys, in turn opening the valves to let air into the pipes, which are located {{at the rear of}} the instrument. Tunes are selected by first lifting the <b>bar</b> <b>carrying</b> the keys, then shifting the barrel along its length. This brings a different set of pins and staples in line with the keys.|$|R
50|$|Arriva Trains Wales {{announced}} in January 2016 that their Avantix machines will be withdrawn after March 2016. The replacement machines will produce paper tickets with no magnetic stripe; instead they will <b>carry</b> a <b>bar</b> code {{which can be}} read by some National Rail ticket barriers. As they are not compatible with barriers on the London Underground {{they will not be}} accepted for cross-London services on the Underground even if this would normally be included in the fare. A pilot scheme will operate on Cardiff local services from mid-January, however, the tickets issued will not be valid on services operated by other companies, including other Arriva franchises.|$|R

The present investigation was aimed {{to determine the}} minimum lethal concentration of glufosinate-ammonium (Finale ®) in beans plants cv. `CIAP 7247 F' grown in greenhouse. Different concentrations of the herbicide were applied to the foliage of plants in acclimatization phase (20, 30 y 40 mg l- 1) and the control. Results showed that the minimum lethal concentration in plants in acclimatization phase was 30 mg l- 1.

40|$|Construction of the dehydrin gene {{was made}} in a plant {{expression}} vector <b>carrying</b> the <b>bar</b> gene as a selectable marker {{in order to use}} in transforming wheat cultivar Giza 164. Plant transformation was made to the immature embryo-derived calli using biolistic bombardment. A tissue culture and transformation protocol were performed and bar gene was used as a selectable marker against the herbicide bialaphos. Five putative transgenic plants were successfully detected by leaf painting with the herbicide. Molecular analyses were done for these plantlets at the structural level; three gave positive results with PCR. The integration of the dehydrin gene into the genomic background of two transgenic plants was confirmed by Southern blotting...|$|R
50|$|One day in {{contemporary}} Mexicali, a poker {{game in the}} back room of a cantina includes horse breeder Jim Carey, cowboys Shep and Johnny, a prospector called Old Willy, a stranger in town named Frazee and a drifter, Chalk. Guitar player Josh and bartender Bibbs are kibbitzing. Conversation turns to a legendary wagon train <b>carrying</b> gold <b>bars</b> worth $5 million lost 100 years ago in the Walking Hills, a huge area of shifting dunes across the border in the United States. Johnny, not paying attention, casually mentions how his horse recently tripped over an old wagon wheel in the hills. To keep the discovery a secret, they agree that all of them including Jim's man Cleve must join the search for the wagon train.|$|R
40|$|The {{resolution}} and fidelity of global chronostratigraphic correlation are direct {{functions of the}} time period under consideration. By virtue of deep-ocean cores and astrochronology, the Cenozoic and Mesozoic time scales <b>carry</b> error <b>bars</b> of a few thousand years (k. y.) to a few hundred k. y. In contrast, most of the Paleozoic time scale <b>carries</b> error <b>bars</b> of plus or minus a few million years (m. y.), and chronostratigraphic control better than +/- 1 m. y. is considered "high resolution. " The general lack of Paleozoic abyssal sediments and paucity of orbitally tuned Paleozoic data series combined with the relative incompleteness of the Paleozoic stratigraphic record have proven historically to be such an obstacle to intercontinental chronostratigraphic correlation that resolving the Paleozoic time scale to the level achieved during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic was viewed as impractical, impossible, or both. Here, we utilize integrated graptolite, conodont, and carbonate carbon isotope (delta C- 13 carb) data from three paleocontinents (Baltica, Avalonia, and Laurentia) to demonstrate chronostratigraphic control for upper Llandovery through middle Wenlock (TelychianSheinwoodian, similar to 436 - 426 Ma) strata with a resolution {{of a few hundred}} k. y. The interval surrounding the base of the Wenlock Series can now be correlated globally with precision approaching 100 k. y., but some intervals (e. g., uppermost Telychian and upper Shein-woodian) are either yet to be studied in sufficient detail or do not show sufficient biologic speciation and/or extinction or carbon isotopic features to delineate such small time slices. Although producing such resolution during the Paleozoic presents an array of challenges unique to the era, we have begun to demonstrate that erecting a Paleozoic time scale comparable to that of younger eras is achievable...|$|R
25|$|Abraham the Great {{had started}} a monastic reform {{movement}} which Babai and other disciples <b>carried</b> through. Since <b>Bar</b> Sauma and the Synod of Beth Lapat, monks and nuns had been encouraged to marry. When Babai returned to Mt. Izla in 604, he expelled monks that lived with women {{on the fringes of}} the monastery, and enforced strict discipline, emphasizing a deep life of prayer and solitude. The result was a mass exodus, not only of the married monks.|$|R

50|$|The {{first use}} of {{concrete}} as a major bridge construction material was in 1856. It was used to form a multiple-arch structure on the Grand Maître Aqueduct in France. The concrete was cast in its crudest form, a huge mass without reinforcement. Later in the nineteenth century, engineers explored the possibilities of reinforced concrete as a structural material. They found that the concrete carried compressive forces, while steel <b>bars</b> <b>carried</b> the tension forces. This made concrete a better material for structures.|$|R

50|$|Levels {{feature a}} multi-story, brick {{platform}} motif, with ladders and suspended hand-to-hand bars that offer multiple ways to travel throughout. The player can dig holes into floors to temporarily trap guards and may safely walk atop trapped guards. Should a guard be <b>carrying</b> a <b>bar</b> of gold when he {{falls into a}} hole it will be left behind, and can be retrieved by the player. Over time, floors dug into will regenerate, filling in these holes. A trapped guard who cannot escape a hole before it fills is consumed, immediately respawning in a random location {{at the top of}} the level. Unlike guards, the player's character may not climb up out of a hole, and will be killed if it fills before he can escape by other means. Floors may also contain trapdoors, through which the player and guards will fall, and bedrock, through which the player cannot dig.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2008 elections, Republicans {{gained control}} of both {{chambers}} of the General Assembly {{for the first time}} since Reconstruction. Furthermore, the economy faltered with the onset of the Great Recession, limiting what Bredesen could accomplish during his remaining years in office. In 2009, Bredesen called for nearly $129 million in state spending cuts, and enacted a voluntary buyout for state employees that reduced the workforce by 5% without requiring layoffs. [...] In May 2009, Bredesen vetoed a bill that would have allowed people to <b>carry</b> guns in <b>bars,</b> but the legislature overrode his veto.|$|R
