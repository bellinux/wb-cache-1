500|$|Present {{throughout}} the songs background {{is the use}} of violins and a choir, as well as guitar, string instruments, congas and a cajon. [...] However it does make subtle use of synths and electronic sounds. Musically and lyrically, it is influenced by Contemporary Christian music, and has a gospel feel, while including standard pop and R. The song opens with Bieber singing, [...] "And I pray" [...] over a keyboard, while the song's chorus repeats one simple refrain, [...] "I <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and I can see a better day/ I <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and pray." [...] In the lyrics, Bieber [...] "recognizes the pain and suffering in the world" [...] and then offers [...] "a passive solution" [...] through lines such as [...] "Children are crying / soldiers are dying / Some people don't have a home," [...] before compromising, [...] "I know there's sunshine beyond that rain / good times beyond that pain." [...] Vocally, Bieber's vocals are sung in a lower key compared to previous singles.|$|E
500|$|... "In the Dark" [...] is a dance-pop {{song that}} {{features}} a house rhythm and a prominent saxophone riff {{that serves as the}} song's instrumentation. Critics compared the riff to [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] (2011) by Romanian singer Alexandra Stan. [...] "In the Dark" [...] opens with Dev's sing-talk vocal style as she sings [...] "On my waist, through my hair / Think about it when you touch me there / <b>Close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> here you are dance-dance-dancing in the dark." [...] According to Nadine Cheung of AOL Radio, the line borrows the melody from Reel 2 Real's [...] "I Like to Move It" [...] (1994). [...] "In the Dark" [...] sees Dev using her singing voice more than her distinctive sing-talk style. Lyrically, the song speaks of sex drives and letting sensation of touch fully taking over from sight, as Dev repeats the line, [...] "I got a sex drive that's push to start". According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, [...] "In the Dark" [...] is written in the time signature of common time and set in a moderately fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is written in the key of C minor and Dev's vocals span from the note of A4 to the note of B5. It has a basic sequence of Cm–E6–A5–G5 as its chord progression.|$|E

60|$|In {{one corner}} of the cabin was a {{platform}} of poles, covered with straw. I threw the sleeping-bag on this, and was soon stretched out. Misgivings as to my strength worried me before I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> Once on <b>my</b> back, I felt I could not rise; my chest was sore; my cough deep and rasping. It seemed I had scarcely <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> when Jones's impatient voice recalled me from sweet oblivion.|$|R
500|$|Critical {{response}} to Necrid varied. University of Delaware professor Rachel Hutchinson cited {{him as an}} example of the cultural stereotype of human versus monster, a [...] "mutated or damned [...] deviant from the human norm" [...] that the game's human characters are expected to vanquish. A staff writer for GameNOW magazine called the visual design [...] "silly" [...] and compared the character to an [...] "old-school He-Man character", but added that Necrid's gameplay was decent. Another magazine, GMR, described him {{as an example of}} [...] "bad American comic book design". IGN's Kaiser Hwang called Necrid a [...] "disappointment" [...] and questioned the character's design in comparison to others in the series; he also felt Necrid was [...] "filler" [...] rather than a complete character. GameSpot made similar comments in their review of the game, as did GameSpy. IGN's Xbox article editor described the character's inclusion as an unnecessary marketing ploy and would have preferred new characters made without McFarlane's involvement; the editor also wrote that Necrid did not [...] "vibe" [...] with the rest of the game. 1UP.com's podcast Retronauts criticized the design and wrote that the character's name was used as a synonym for [...] "shitty". They further added that McFarlane had [...] "tainted" [...] the game with Necrid's inclusion, with host Jeremy Parish stating [...] "I could <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and draw a better character". In a retrospective of the series, Joystiq used him {{as an example of the}} series succumbing to [...] "commercial gimmicks", citing his design as reviled and that Necrid was either too strong or too weak a character to play as, depending on who one asked.|$|E
500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, {{he opened his eyes and}} this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E
2500|$|The Philips Record company's {{studio was}} slated as [...] "an {{extremely}} dead studio", {{it felt as}} though it had turned the treble down: [...] "There was no [...] and it was like singing in a padded cell. I {{had to get out of}} there". Springfield would end up in the ladies' toilets for its superior acoustics. Another example of refusal to use the studio is [...] "I <b>Close</b> <b>My</b> <b>Eyes</b> and Count to Ten" [...] – recorded at the end of a corridor.|$|E

It was a Bessie Smith recording of 'The Bleeding Hearted Blues,' with 'Midnight Blues' {{on the other}} side. The first time I laid the needle down on that record I felt cold chills and an indescribable excitement. It was my first exposure to jazz and the blues, although I had no {{idea at the time}} what to call those magical sounds. I just knew I had to hear more of them! — Frankie Laine ...|$|E
2500|$|Sculptor Jon Bickley {{perceived}} a {{kinship with}} Johnson noting that [...] "It seems Dr. Johnson and I {{were meant to}} come together [...] [...] [...] He was born in Lichfield, in the Midlands, and I was brought up just outside it. I can <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and picture his birth house." [...] Bickley modelled the cat on his own pet, Thomas Henry, and carefully selected the sculpture's height for maximum accessibility: [...] "I made Hodge about shoulder height for the average adult, which is just about right for putting an arm around." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kastner's {{critics also}} argue that he promised the SS not to warn Hungarian Jews to avoid {{jeopardizing}} negotiations to save the Jews who escaped on the Kastner train. In 1960, an interview with Eichmann, made by the Dutch Nazi journalist Willem Sassen in Argentina, was published in Life Magazine. Eichmann said that Kastner [...] "agreed {{to help keep the}} Jews from resisting deportation—and even keep order in the collection camps—if I would <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and let a few hundred or a few thousand young Jews emigrate to Palestine. It was a good bargain". Rudolf Vrba wrote, [...] "Kastner paid for those 1,684 lives with his silence".|$|E

2500|$|Around age eleven, Mary Albert {{moved to}} a one-room house on Perdido Street with Louis, her {{daughter}} Lucy, and her common-law husband, Tom Lee. They lived next door to Mary Albert's brother Ike and his two sons. After {{dropping out of the}} Fisk School in 1912, Armstrong joined a quartet of boys who sang in the streets for money. He also started to get into trouble. Cornet player Bunk Johnson said he taught Armstrong (then 11) to play by ear at Dago Tony's Tonk in New Orleans, although in his later years Armstrong gave the credit to Oliver. Armstrong hardly looked back at his youth as the worst of times but drew inspiration from it instead: [...] "Every time I <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> blowing that trumpet of mine—I look right in the heart of good old New Orleans... It has given me something to live for." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{second season}} of Dusty, which {{featured}} her rendition of [...] "Get Ready" [...] and her UK No.13 hit, [...] "I'll Try Anything", was broadcast in 1967. It attracted a healthy audience but the series {{did not keep}} up with changes in pop music. The comparatively progressive album Where Am I Going? (October 1967) attempted to redress this by containing a [...] "jazzy", orchestrated version of [...] "Sunny" [...] and Jacques Brel's [...] "If You Go Away". Though it was critically appreciated, it did not sell well in the US – it reached the top40 in the UK. In November 1968, a similar fate befell Dusty... Definitely, which was not issued in the US, it reached the UK top30. Her choice of material ranged from the rolling [...] "Ain't No Sun Since You've Been Gone" [...] to the aching emotion of [...] "I Think It's Gonna Rain Today". In that same year, Springfield had a UK No.4 hit, [...] "I <b>Close</b> <b>My</b> <b>Eyes</b> and Count to Ten", which was written by Clive Westlake. Its flipside, [...] "No Stranger Am I", was co-written by Norma Tanega and Norma Kutzer. By late 1966, Springfield was in a domestic relationship with Tanega – a US-born singer-songwriter who had a UK Top30 hit with the novelty song, [...] "Walkin' My Cat Named Dog". Springfield's ITV series It Must Be Dusty was broadcast in May and June 1968, episode six featured a duet performance of [...] "Mockingbird" [...] with singer-guitarist Jimi Hendrix fronting his band, The Experience.|$|E
