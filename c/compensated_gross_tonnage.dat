40|$|Market {{researcher}} Clarkson Research Studies {{reports that}} Korea's {{total amount of}} ship orders in the first 11 months of 2005 amounted to 13. 9 million <b>compensated</b> <b>gross</b> <b>tonnage</b> (CGT), or about 39 percent of the global market (35. 5 million CGT). This outstrips the combined orders won by Japan (5. 9 million CGT) and the whole of Europe (7. 4 million CGT). Korea is the world s largest shipbuilding nation and Korean shipbuilders are expected to lead the global market for the next decade. Korean firms have secured enough orders for future, especially increased orders for liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers. There are almost 80 shipbuilders in Korea, but nine major shipbuilders, {{who are members of}} the Korea Shipbuilders Association (KSA), take most of the shipbuilding orders. Seven of them are among the world's top 10. The main players are Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI), Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) and Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction (HHIC). These giant monsters have threatened other shipbuilding nations, especially Europe. The EU has accused Korean shipbuilders of threatening the future of Europe s shipbuilding industry through unfair subsidies and took some actions against Korea as follows. In 1999, European Commission reported to the Council on the situation in world shipbuilding, which showed European yards trapped in a crisis of downward spiraling prices, {{due in large part to}} excess capacities in South Korea. This report promoted the European Commission to issue a proposal for a Council Decision on the signing and conclusion of an International Agreement between the European Community and Korea relating to assistance of the world shipbuilding market. Eventually, the European Communities took Korea to the WTO in 2002, claiming that Korean shipbuilders received subsidies in the wake of the Asian financial crisis of 1997. Moreover the EU has had Temporary Defensive Mechanism for Shipbuilding (the "TDM Regulation"), which is keeping Korean builders from selling vessels in the European market. Norwegian shipbuilding industry also has dramatically declined, being trapped in a crisis since 1998 under pressure by increased competition from Asia, but it survived by shifting production towards the national offshore oil and gas industry and ship equipment manufacturing. Norway becomes a leading manufacturer of ship s gear in the world. Korea is a major market for Norwegian suppliers of ship s gear and related service. Therefore, good prospects for Korean shipyards are good news for the Norwegian supply industry. Trade and investments between Norway and Korea has grown significantly over the past ten years in maritime industry and Korea is today one of Norway's major trade partners in Asia. Norway has one of the world s largest commercial shipping fleets, so Norwegian shipowners are one of major target for Korean shipbuilders. In fact, Norwegian shipowners have built many of their ships at the Korean shipyards. These ships have been big oil tankers, container ships, combination carriers and ro-ro ships. Korean builders eager to take more shipbuilding orders and have focused on building high-tech and high value added vessels e. g. liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers, liquefied petroleum/chemical gas (LPG) carrier and passenger ships. Since the Norwegian petroleum sector is a main national industry and the crews business is well established and developed, a number of shipbuilding contracts between Korea and Norway are likely to rise steadily. Moreover, soaring demand for LNG, driven by rising gas consumption and higher crude oil prices, will boost the number of shipbuilding contracts between Korea and Norway. In short, shipbuilding marker as itself clearly shows the reason why we have to look closely at shipbuilding contracts between Norwegian buyers and Korean builders. My thesis will be a nautical chart for Norwegian buyers and Korean builders when they sail on unclear and risky water (shipbuilding contract) between Norway and Korea. My chart will not encompass all dangerous areas and warnings, because 50 pages are too short to display the Whole Ocean of shipbuilding contract. So I will limit myself to compare and analyze only the most significant clauses relating to Subcontracting in different standard forms under English law. The subcontracting is triple relationship among the buyer, the buyer and a subcontractor. Two parallel disputes concerning same defect thus may arise: i) one between the buyer and the builder and ii) one between the builder and a subcontractor. To avoid discrepancies in the course of judging disputes, they should endeavor to harmonies procedure provisions to avoid two parallel disputes at different fora and with different arbitrators or judges. If it is commercially and practically difficult to do so, the parties shall strive to incorporate reasonable and adequate clauses while considering the peculiar characteristic of subcontracting in the shipbuilding context after carefully analyzing those issues which I will discuses in this study. I will go deep into the issues to answer the following questions What is Subcontracting? in Chapter 3, To what extent is subcontracting permitted? in Chapter 4, To what extent is the builder responsible for the performance of the subcontractor? in Chapter 5 and To what extent is the builder protected in particular by the force majeure clause against delay or non-performance by the subcontractors? in Chapter 6. The answers to these questions can differ much, depending on the different terms and clauses in different shipbuilding contract. So I will attempt to answer the questions based on the Norwegian standard form, HHI, SHI, DSME, and HHIC standard form, comparing and analyzing the terms and clauses in those standard shipbuilding contract forms...|$|E
