5000|$|Glulam optimizes the {{structural}} {{values of a}} renewable resource - wood. Because of their composition, large glulam members can be manufactured {{from a variety of}} smaller trees harvested from second- and third-growth forests and plantations. Glulam provides the strength and versatility of large wood members without relying on the old growth-dependent solid-sawn timbers. [...] As with other engineered wood products, it reduces the overall amount of wood used when compared to solid sawn timbers by diminishing the negative impact of knots and other small defects in each <b>component</b> <b>board.</b> [...] Glulam has much lower embodied energy than reinforced concrete and steel, although of course it does entail more embodied energy than solid timber. However, the laminating process allows timber to be used for much longer spans, heavier loads, and complex shapes. Glulam is two-thirds the weight of steel and one sixth the weight of concrete - the embodied energy to produce it is six times less than the same suitable strength of steel. Glulam can be manufactured to a variety of straight and curved configurations so it offers architects artistic freedom without sacrificing structural requirements.|$|E

40|$|Pulse IR {{thermography}} {{has been}} used for the detection of hidden flaws and cracks in macroscopic structures (e. g. turbine blades, propellers) for several years, but as IR cameras are becoming increasingly refined in their time, space and temperature resolution capabilities it is possible to transfer the method on to failure detection in microelectronic devices. It has been successfully employed for short circuit analysis in integrated circuits or for detection of voids and delaminations in BEOL and packaging materials and interconnects. The measurement principle is hereby always the same: The structure under test is excited by a transient thermal pulse before its thermal response over time is recorded by the IR camera. Different excitation modes exist to impart the energy pulse to the structure: One distinguishes between electrical, flashlight, laser-flash, eddy-current, ultrasonic and IR-beam excitation mode, where the method of choice depends on the structures on <b>component,</b> <b>board</b> or system level. The signal-to-noise ratio can be enhanced considerably by using a lock-in amplifier, allowing the detection of very small temperature differences generated actively or indirectly by the defects in the structure. [...] This paper focuses on the evaluation of best applicability and resolution of the different excitation modes for the detection of certain flaws prominent in microelectronic packages and devices. We have exemplified the method of pulse thermography on cracks in vias of organic boards, delaminations in adhesive die attach materials and in molding compounds of encapsulated packages. By trying various excitation modes, we have found that cracks in thermal vias can best be monitored by electrical stimulation, whereas large scale screening of imperfections on board or wafer level can be traced by single flashlight excitation. Flaws in materials with higher diffusivity can be found by laser excitation due to the possibility to introduce higher energy pulses. This method can be used in reflection and transmission mode, the latter being also capable of measuring thermal conductivity contactless at different temperatures without having to take a contact resistance into account (laser-flash method). Lock-in thermography was demonstrated on small hot-spots on die-level and periodically loaded mechanical structures exploiting the thermo-elastic effect. Thus mechanical stresses can be detected optically and evaluated quantitatively. Here, first measurement results will be presented. The measurements obtained by non-distructive IR thermography are compared to other failure-analytical techniques and finite element simulations in order to verify and explain the results where necessary...|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} of {{portable electronic devices}} was studied by applying standardized test procedures for test vehicles that represent the technologies and lead-free materials typically used in novel portable products. Thermal cycling and drop testing are commonly used because they reveal the failure modes and mechanisms that portable devices experience in operational environments. A large number of <b>component</b> <b>boards</b> were assembled in a full-scale production line to enable proper statistical and fractographic analyses. The test boards were assembled with different printed wiring <b>board</b> protective coatings, <b>component</b> under bump metallizations, and solder pad structures. The <b>component</b> <b>boards</b> were tested and the times-to-failure of the various combinations were statistically analyzed. The reliability data were also analyzed by the Weibull method, and the characteristic lifetimes and shape parameters were calculated. The failure modes under the thermal cycling, where solder interconnections fail by cracking through the bulk solder, were different from those observed in the drop tests, where cracks propagate along the intermetallic layers {{on either side of}} the interconnections. Under the thermomechanical loading the as-soldered microstructure, which is composed of only a few large eutectic colonies, undergoes local recrystallization that produces networks of grain boundaries along which the intergranular cracks damage solder interconnections. Under the mechanical shock loading, in turn, the strain–rate hardening of the solder material forces cracks to propagate in the intermetallic layers instead of the bulk solder. It was found that the {{reliability of}} solder interconnections can improve when the <b>component</b> <b>boards</b> have undergone thermal cycles before drop testing. The high-angle boundaries between the recrystallized grains generated during thermal cycling provide paths along which cracks can propagate but the propagation through the bulk solder consumes more energy than the propagation through brittle intermetallic layers. On the other hand, prolonged lifetime at elevated temperatures can reduce the drop test reliability considerably due to the formation of Kirkendall voids in the Cu 3 Sn intermetallic layers. reviewe...|$|R

Moreover, portable equipment {{are exposed to}} mechanical shocks due to accidental dropping, and therefore their reliability should be studied with tests that simulate the real operational loading conditions as realistically as possible. The reliability of WL-CSP <b>component</b> <b>boards</b> was studied by executing mechanical shock tests at different temperatures according to the JESD 22 -B 111 standard. Heating of the components was produced with the integrated heater elements on silicon chip inside the component package {{in order to create}} temperature distributions of the <b>component</b> <b>boards</b> that are comparable to those in real products. The tests were carried out at four different temperatures: 25, 75, 100 and 125 °C. The number of drops-to-failure was found to increase significantly with temperature. The failure analyses revealed that the testing temperature did not alter the nucleation site of cracks but their propagation path changed gradually from the intermetallic layers to the solder bumps with increasing temperature. The most likely reason for this change of crack propagation {{is the fact that the}} strength of solder and the stiffness of the printed wiring board in the vicinity of the component are reduced markedly with increasing temperature. As a result the level of the highest stresses in the interconnections are decreased and the number of drops-to-failure increased with temperature...|$|R
