40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the <b>completion</b> of fit <b>notes</b> by UK general practitioners (GPs). A series of actual fit notes issued to employed patients were examined, and their GPs’ reflections and experiences of fit <b>note</b> <b>completion</b> explored. Methods: A mixed-methods design was used. Data were collected from copies of 94 fit notes issued to employed patients by 11 GPs, and from 86 questionnaires completed by these GPs reflecting on the fit notes they had issued. Face-to-face interviews were then conducted with each GP. Results: Fit <b>note</b> <b>completion</b> is not meeting expectations for a number of reasons. These include the following: limited knowledge and awareness of the guidance in fit note completion; problems with the fit note format; lack of mandatory training in completing fit notes; lack of incentive to change practice; incomplete implementation of the electronic fit note; GPs’ lack of confidence in, and doubts about the appropriateness of performing this role. Conclusion: If UK GPs are to continue their contractual responsibility for completing fit notes, further consideration of their education and training needs is urgently required. Weaknesses in the design and format of the fit note and the availability of the electronic version also need to be addressed...|$|R

40|$|Background: Incomplete or delayed {{access to}} {{discharge}} information by outpatient providers and patients contributes to discontinuity {{of care and}} poor outcomes. Objective: To evaluate {{the effect of a}} new electronic discharge summary tool on the timeliness of documentation and communication with outpatient providers. Methods: In June 2012, we implemented an electronic discharge summary tool at our 145 -bed university-affiliated Veterans Affairs hospital. The tool facilitates completion of a comprehensive discharge summary note that is available for patients and outpatient medical providers at the time of hospital discharge. Discharge summary note availability, outpatient provider satisfaction, and time between the decision to discharge a patient and discharge <b>note</b> <b>completion</b> were all evaluated before and after implementation of the tool. Results: The percentage of discharge summary notes completed by the time of first post-discharge clinical contact improved from 43 % in February 2012 to 100 % in September 2012 and was maintained at 100 % in 2014. A survey of 22 outpatient providers showed that 90 % preferred the new summary and 86 % found it comprehensive. Despite increasing required documentation, the time required to discharge a patient, from physician decision to discharge <b>note</b> <b>completion,</b> improved from 5. 6 [*]h in 2010 to 4. 1 [*]h in 2012 (p[*]=[*] 0. 04), and to 2. 8 [*]h in 2015 (p[*]<[*] 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Birth {{plans are}} written {{preferences}} for labor and birth which women prepare in advance. Most {{studies have examined}} them as a novel intervention or "outside" formal care provision. This study considered use of a standard birth plan section within a national, woman-held maternity record. Methods: Exploratory qualitative {{interviews were conducted with}} women (42) and maternity service staff (24) in northeast Scotland. Data were analyzed thematically. Results: Staff and women were generally positive about the provision of the birth plan section within the record. Perceived benefits included the opportunity to highlight preferences, enhance communication, stimulate discussions, and address anxieties. However, not all women experienced these benefits or understood the birth plan's purpose. Some were unaware of the opportunity to complete it or could not access the support they needed from staff to discuss or be confident about their options. Some were reluctant to plan too much. Staff recognized the need to support women with birth plan <b>completion</b> but <b>noted</b> practical challenges to this. Conclusions: A supportive antenatal opportunity to allow discussion of options may be needed to realize the potential benefits of routine inclusion of birth plans in maternity notes...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Interdisciplinary rounds (IDR) with {{documentation}} {{have become}} a standard of care, but {{the process has been}} incompletely described in academic general medical settings. Checklists are promoted, yet standardized formats may not reflect the variability and work flow of rounds or support the cognitive development of medical trainees. We describe IDR processes in an academic general medicine inpatient setting and present a rapid cycle quality improvement (QI) project that improved IDR documentation rates in the electronic health record. METHODS: The project team observed existing daily IDR rounds on two medical inpatient units at the Iowa City VA Medical Center, with three resident teams and maximum census of 42 patients. The major intervention was a redesigned note template, with accompanying resident educational materials. The primary outcome was <b>note</b> <b>completion</b> rates by charge nurses; IDR team member satisfaction and participation, discussion time and balancing metrics (i. e., excess bed days of care, length of stay, and 30 -day readmissions) were also assessed. RESULTS: An electronic template and accompanying educational materials designed to parallel the heuristic problem-solving activities of the IDR team led to improvements in IDR <b>note</b> <b>completion</b> rates from 27 to 69 %. Team member satisfaction was high and participation was stable. Discussion time per patient increased modestly, but varied widely between resident teams and by patient. Balancing metrics were unchanged. Unstructured evaluation indicated that documentation times were reduced, and IDR documentation became more timely and useful. CONCLUSIONS: IDR notes designed to support the problem-solving processes of an interdisciplinary group improved the timeliness and perceived value of IDR documentation and met regulatory standards. Aligning complex processes and educational and documentation needs during IDR may create an efficient opportunity for sustainable interdisciplinary work and learning in an academic setting...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} patients’ profiles, demographics, {{clinical and}} therapeutic approaches and strategies {{in patients with}} tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBG). Patients and methods: A retrospective study of all TBG-confirmed cases admitted in a tuberculosis specific health care facility between 1 January 2009 and 16 June 2013. Results: A total of 181 clinical files were examined. Mean age was 32 years old; the female/male ratio was 1. 78 to 1. Raw milk consumption was noted in 1 / 3 of patients. Most cases involved {{the head and neck}} region (83. 4 %), nodes involvement, including axillary (12 cases), and mediastinal (9 cases). Clinical symptoms were present in only 55. 2 %. TST was conducted with 82. 6 % positive responses. Diagnostics confirmation was done with anatomical pathology in most of the patients; only 56 of them had any microbiology analysis done. Demonstration of acid-fast bacilli in microscopy from either fine-needle aspirates or biopsies was done in 17. 5 %, and cultures yielded positive results in 27 %. Treatment duration was varied. Paradoxical reactions were noted in 12 % and persistent lymphadenopathy after treatment <b>completion</b> was <b>noted</b> in 10 % of cases. Conclusions: TBG remains a disease of interest.

40|$|Abstract—Storage area {{networking}} {{is driving}} commodity data center switches to support lossless Ethernet (DCB). Unfortu-nately, to enable DCB for all traffic on arbitrary network topologies, we must address several {{problems that can}} arise in lossless networks, e. g., large buffering delays, unfairness, head of line blocking, and deadlock. We propose TCP-Bolt, a TCP variant that not only addresses the first three problems but reduces flow completion times {{by as much as}} 70 %. We also introduce a simple, practical deadlock-free routing scheme that eliminates deadlock while achieving aggregate network throughput within 15 % of ECMP routing. This small compromise in potential routing capacity is well worth the gains in flow <b>completion</b> time. We <b>note</b> that our results on deadlock-free routing are also of independent interest to the storage area networking community. Further, as our hardware testbed illustrates, these gains are achievable today, without hardware changes to switches or NICs. I...|$|R
