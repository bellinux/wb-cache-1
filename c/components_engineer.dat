Since a formal proof of the complete safe-behaviour of the resulting ad-hoc system is not possible, this paper argues that Proof Oriented Systems Engineering formal techniques should bridge the gap with Fault Tolerant Systems Engineering practical techniques in order to mathematically check the proof of fail-safety.

If it passes the formal test, then engineers will deliver {{the latest version}} of the component to users and collect reactions and feedback. At the end of this step, developers analyze artifacts of previous steps, and then make a choice whether they should go through iteration again or go over to the next iteration for the other components. During this phase, the agent-supported development environment could conduct the formal test on the components and collect the results of the testing and feedback instead of the team. Consequently, the specifications of changed requirements, the revisions for the satisfaction, and progress should be documented.|$|R

40|$|Rapid {{prototyping}} {{is widely}} seen as an effective tool for compressing time to market for new products.

40|$|Not all ferrites are equivalent, {{especially}} their saturation flux density properties. Today’s trend for name brand ferrite companies {{to have their}} products private labeled for them by low cost bidders around the world rather than manufacture their own ferrites necessitates the importance of specifying saturation properties. Circuit currents typically escalate and spike when {{the core of a}} magnetic component saturate. These high currents typically cause other circuit components (semiconductor switches, diodes, capacitors) to fail well before any permanent damage occurs to the magnetic component. Because no permanent damage occurs to the magnetic component the true root cause for these failures often goes undetected. <b>Component</b> <b>engineers</b> meticulously specify dimensions, inductance and power loss but typically neglect the saturation properties of the magnetic component and their cores. This paper proposes a simple, fast and inexpensive method of measuring the saturation properties of magnetic components and their cores and offers a simple technique for determining the saturation specification for a ferrite core...|$|R
40|$|Even hardware-focused {{industries}} today develop products where {{software is}} both a large and important <b>component.</b> <b>Engineers</b> tasked with developing and integrating these products do not always have a software engineering background.

Search-based testing could be a key aspect in creating an automated tool for supporting testing activities. However, domain specific quality criteria and trade-offs {{make it difficult to}} develop a general fitness function a priori, so interaction between domain specialists and such a tool would be critical to its success. In this paper we present a system for interactive search based software testing and investigate a way for domain specialists to guide the search by dynamically re-weighting quality goals. Our empirical investigation shows that objective reweighing can help a human domain specialist interactively guide the search, without requiring specialised knowledge of the system and without sacrificing population diversity...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this SAND Report is to {{document}} efforts in the extraction and failure analyses of sleeve-style Lightning Arrestor Connectors (LACs).

40|$|Qualification ” {{of fiber}} optic {{components}} holds {{a very different}} meaning than it did ten years ago. In the past, qualification meant extensive prolonged testing and screening {{that led to a}} programmatic method of reliability assurance. For space flight programs today, the combination of using higher performance commercial technology, with shorter development schedules and tighter mission budgets makes long term testing and reliability characterization unfeasible. In many cases space flight missions will be using technology within years of its development and an example of this is fiber laser technology. Although the technology itself is not a new product the components that comprise a fiber laser system change frequently as processes and packaging changes occur. Once a process or the materials for manufacturing a component change, even the data that existed on its predecessor can no longer provide assurance on the newer version. In order to assure reliability during a space flight mission, the <b>component</b> <b>engineer</b> must understand the requirements of the space flight environment as well as the physics of failure of the components themselves. This can be incorporated into an efficient and effective testing plan that “qualifies ” a component to specific criteria defined by the program given the mission requirements and the component limitations.
