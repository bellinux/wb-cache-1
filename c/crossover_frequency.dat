25|$|In weightlessness, astronauts {{must rely}} {{much more on}} vision to {{maintain}} their spatial orientation, because the otolith organs can no longer signal the “down” direction. During prolonged exposure, however, reliance seems to shift toward an intrinsic, body vertical reference. The erroneous illusions of self-motion during head movements performed during and after return to Earth gravity are presumably due to a re-interpretation of vestibular inputs. Ground-based {{studies suggest that the}} CNS resolves the “tilt-translation” ambiguity based on the frequency content of the linear acceleration detected by the otolith organs, with low frequency indicating “tilt” and high frequency indicating “translation”. A crossover exists at about 0.3Hz where the otolith signals are then ambiguous. Exposure to weightlessness presumably results in a shift of this <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency,</b> which could then contribute to spatial disorientation and SMS.|$|E

25|$|Morgan and his {{students}} became more successful at finding mutant flies; they counted the mutant characteristics of thousands of fruit flies and studied their inheritance. As they accumulated multiple mutants, they combined them to study more complex inheritance patterns. The observation of a miniature-wing mutant, which was also on the sex chromosome but sometimes sorted independently to the white-eye mutation, led Morgan {{to the idea of}} genetic linkage and to hypothesize the phenomenon of crossing over. He relied on the discovery of Frans Alfons Janssens, a Belgian professor at the University of Leuven, who described the phenomenon in 1909 and had called it chiasmatypie. Morgan proposed that the amount of crossing over between linked genes differs and that <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency</b> might indicate the distance separating genes on the chromosome. The later English geneticist J. B. S. Haldane suggested that the unit of measurement for linkage be called the morgan. Morgan's student Alfred Sturtevant developed the first genetic map in 1913.|$|E

50|$|A typical {{characteristic}} of a 2-way speaker {{is that at the}} <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency,</b> due to the physical distance between the centres of the woofer and tweeter, the sound that emanates from the combination is not omni-directional, but lobed. Within the region of the lobe the sound level, at the <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency</b> is much higher as compared to outside the lobe. Therefore loudspeaker designers try to make the main lobe as fat as possible, by using drivers that are as small as possible in diameter so as to allow closer spacing between them. However, the lowest frequency of interest (bass) puts a lower limit to the woofer's diameter. Therefore, such speakers will always have lobing.|$|E
50|$|At {{the very}} least, such a {{loudspeaker}} may be 2-way employing a woofer (or mid-range/mid-woofer) and a tweeter. Higher end loudspeakers may be 3-way or even 4-way. For {{the sake of}} this article and simplicity, a 2-way speaker system will be assumed - consisting of a woofer and a tweeter. Since the woofer covers the lower-end of the audio spectrum and the tweeter covers the upper-end, the dividing point between the two being the <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency,</b> it is of utmost importance that, at the <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency</b> the outputs of both drivers should acoustically sum {{so as to be}} seamless, without any peaks or dips, otherwise the loudspeaker is said to colour the sound.|$|E
50|$|A Linkwitz-Riley (L-R) filter is an {{infinite}} impulse response filter used in Linkwitz-Riley audio crossovers, named after its inventors Siegfried Linkwitz and Russ Riley, which was originally described in Active Crossover Networks for Noncoincident Drivers in JAES Volume 24 Issue 1 pp. 2-8; February 1976. It {{is also known}} as a Butterworth squared filter. An L-R crossover consists of a parallel combination of a low-pass and a high-pass L-R filter. The filters are usually designed by cascading two Butterworth filters, each of which has &minus;3 dB gain at the cut-off frequency. The resulting Linkwitz-Riley filter has a &minus;6 dB gain at the cutoff frequency. This means that summing the low-pass and high-pass outputs, the gain at the <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency</b> will be 0 dB, so the crossover behaves like an all-pass filter, having a flat amplitude response with a smoothly changing phase response. This is the biggest advantage of L-R crossovers compared to Butterworth crossovers, whose summed output has a +3 dB peak around the <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency.</b> Since cascading two nth order Butterworth filters will give a 2nd order Linkwitz-Riley filter, theoretically any 2nd order Linkwitz-Riley crossover can be designed. However, crossovers of higher order than 4th may have less usability due to their increasing peak in group delay around <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency</b> and complexity.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 <b>Crossover</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{for seven}} {{selected}} regions on five chromosomes of maize were measured {{to ascertain the}} effect of chelating agents on recombination. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, EDTA, and dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO, were used in three concentrations singly, and in all combinations. Plants heterozygous for for linked genes governing seed and seedling characteristics were treated with premeiotic foliar spray of EDTA and DMSO for two durations. Appropriate crosses were made and <b>crossover</b> <b>frequencies</b> were calculated from data resulting from test cross and sib cross progeny. The chelating agents were found to influence the frequency of recombination {{in each of the}} regions tested. Crossover reduction was found at high concentrations of the chemicals and at the longer treatment duration. It was concluded that a threshold had been reached causing interference with crossing over or with recovery of <b>crossover</b> products. <b>Crossover</b> <b>frequencies</b> were significantly increased in five chromosome regions by several concentrations of the chelating agents. Although the two agents have different cation affinities, both were found to influence crossing over, indicating that the action was by a mechanism other than the removal of a specific cation from the chromosome. Changes in recombination frequency were found to be of similar magnitude whether the chelating agents were used alone or in combination. It was concluded that the two chemicals did not have a synergistic effect in changing recombination frequency. A relationship was shown between length of crossover region and effect of the chemical treatment. No such relationship was found between the specific locations in chromosomes and response to chelating agents for the seven regions tested. Use of chelating agents offers the possibility of increasing genetic variability. Induction of recombination in a short chromosome region may improve a crop variety by breaking an undesirable gene combination, by linking together genes from adjacent regions of homologous chromosomes, or by producing a novel pleiotropic effect...|$|R

50|$|Both the 601 and {{the first}} 604 had a {{frequency}} response of 60 Hz to 16 kHz with a power rating of only 25 watts, relatively low but acceptable due to the speakers' efficiency.

40|$|Background: In many organisms, {{homologous}} chromosomes rely upon recombination-mediated linkages, termed crossovers, {{to promote their}} accurate segregation at meiosis I. In budding yeast, the evolutionarily conserved mismatchrepair paralogues, Msh 4 and Msh 5, promote crossover formation in conjunction with several other proteins, collectively termed the Synapsis Initiation Complex (SIC) proteins or ‘ZMM’s (Zip 1 -Zip 2 -Zip 3 -Zip 4 -Spo 16, Msh 4 -Msh 5, Mer 3). zmm mutants show decreased levels of crossovers and increased chromosome missegregation, which is thought to cause decreased spore viability. Principal Findings: In contrast to other ZMM mutants, msh 4 and msh 5 mutants show improved spore viability and chromosome segregation in response to elevated temperature (23 °C versus 33 °C). <b>Crossover</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the population of viable spores in msh 4 and msh 5 mutants are similar at both temperatures, suggesting that temperature-mediated chromosome segregation does not occur by increasing <b>crossover</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Furthermore, meiotic progression defects at elevated temperature do not select for a subpopulation of cells with improved segregation. Instead, another ZMM protein, Zip 1, {{is important for the}} temperature-dependent improvement in spore viability.
