5|$|In August, {{elections}} for the <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Deputies</b> returned unfavourable results for Talleyrand. The ministry wished for moderate deputies, but the electorate voted almost exclusively for ultra-royalists, resulting in the so-called Chambre introuvable. The Duchess of Angoulême and the Count of Artois pressured King Louis for the dismissal of his obsolete ministry. Talleyrand tendered his resignation on 20 September. Louis XVIII chose the Duke of Richelieu to be his new Prime Minister. Richelieu was chosen because he was accepted by Louis's family and the reactionary <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Deputies.</b>|$|E

There were eleven dissolutions during PedroII's reign and, of these, ten occurred after consultation with the Council of State, which was beyond what was required by the Constitution. A Constitutional balance of power existed between the General Assembly and the executive branch under the Emperor. The legislature could not operate alone and the monarch could not force his will upon the Assembly. The system functioned smoothly only when both Assembly and Emperor acted in a spirit of cooperation for the national good.|$|E

The <b>chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>deputies</b> {{was composed}} of 100 deputies, in 1810 increased to 166.

The deputy candidates had to be 24 years or older, and government officials, priests or officers in active military service were not eligible for candidacy. They were elected for a nine-year term of office, in three tranches (elections for a third of the deputies were to be held every three years).|$|E

The Justicialists lost eight seats (leaving 103) and smaller, provincial parties made up the difference. Alfonsín surprised observers in April 1986 by announcing {{the creation of a}} panel entrusted to plan a transfer of the nation's capital to Viedma, a small coastal city 800km (500mi) south of Buenos Aires. His proposals boldly called for constitutional amendments creating a Parliamentary system, including a Prime Minister, and were well received by the <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Deputies,</b> though they encountered strong opposition in the Senate.|$|E
