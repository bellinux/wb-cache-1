The Boeing Company has developed a software tool called Modern Control Software Package (MPAC). MPAC provides the environment necessary for linear model development, analysis, and controller design for large models of flexible structures. There are two features of MPAC which are particularly appropriate for use with large models: (1) numerical accuracy and (2) label-driven nature. With the first feature MPAC uses double precision arithmetic for all numerical operations and relies on EISPAC and LINPACK for the numerical foundation. With the second feature, all MPAC model inputs, outputs, and states are referenced by user-defined labels. This feature allows model modification while maintaining the same state, input, and output names. In addition, {{there is no need for}} the user to keep track of a model variable's matrix row and <b>colunm</b> locations. There is a wide range of model manipulation, analysis, and design features within the numerically robust and flexible environment provided by MPAC.

Active sampling with a dip net around a kerosene and a fluorescent light was compared to sampling using an automated light trap. Catches among the three methods differed in taxonomic composition and timing. The families Gerriidae, Labrisomidae and Labridae dominated active netting. Gobiidae and Haemulidae dominated light trap catches. This suggests {{there is a difference}} in larval susceptibility to the different techniques, possibly behavioral. The varying timings of the catches for the different techniques support this theory. The vertical distribution of coral reef fish larvae was examined using light traps. This study showed there are clear patterns of vertical distribution in late stage reef fish larvae. Pomacentnds, Lutjanids and Gerrids dominated shallow traps while deep traps were dominated by catches of Apogonids, Gobiids and Acanthurids.

To facilitate the modeling of inelastic deformations in joint regions, a panel element capable of representing joint shear distortions and joint bearing deformations was incorporated into an existing computer program, IDARC (Kunnath and Reinhorn 1994). The inelastic shear deformation characteristics of the joint panel were partly established from guidelines published by an ASCE Task Committee (ASCE 1993). Various hysteretic control parameters for members of the subassemblage, such as strength degradation, stiffness deterioration, and pinching (slip), were quantified based on observed experimental response (Kanno 1993). Potential failure modes of the frame subassemblage in the steel beam, reinforced concrete or SRC column, and composite joint were able to be represented in the proposed formulation. Experimental subassemblage testing performed at Cornell University (Kanno 1993) was used to validate the analytical platform.

40|$|The {{retention}} {{mechanism of}} polar compounds in hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) {{was investigated in}} order to analyse many polar compounds in pharmaceutical and biological samples. HILIC uses a polar stationary phase in conjunction with an aqueous mobile phase containing {{a high concentration of}} acetonitrile (60 - 95 %). The use of bare silica, silica based bonded phases and polymer based bonded phases were investigated for the separation of catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine) in HILIC and per aqueous liquid chromatography (PALC) mode. A bonded phase column provided complete resolution of catecholamines in comparison to a bare silica column. The retention mechanisms for these polar basic compounds were found to be ionic interaction, partitioning and adsorption. The use of a polymer based ZIC-HILIC column proved that some of the ionic interaction (which is less on a silica based ZIC-HILIC column) is due to sulfonic groups on the column. The HILIC contribution is higher at higher buffer concentration on both polymer and silica based columns. High buffer concentration reduces ionic interaction but also may absorb more water resulting in a thicker aqueous layer on the column surface for solute partitioning. An overloading study of various basic and a quaternary ammonium compound was performed in the HILIC mode with respect to various pH and % ACN in the mobile phase using different <b>colunms</b> including bare silica (Atlantis HILIC, Zorbax Rx SIL, Ascentis HILIC) and bonded phase (ZIC-HILIC, Diol), The results of the study were complex and the results difficult to interpret. However, it was possible to draw some general conclusion. In general the loading capacity of the bare silica and bonded phase column was of the same order. However, there were variations in the comparative loading capacities with pH. The partitioning mechanism was investigated {{in the context of the}} octanol-water distribution coefficient Dow of the solute, A good correlation (R) was achieved between log D and the retention factor (k) of 29 compounds (acidic, basic, quaternary ammonium and neutral) on six different HILIC columns comprising bare silica, amide, dial. zwitterionic and a mixed-mode dial/hydrophobic phase. The correlation of k with log D was found to be improved for each column when the aqueous content of the mobile phase was increased from 5 - 15 % and by changing the pH from 6. 0 to 3. 0. It is possible that adsorption on to the polar groups of the stationary phase at low water content and ionic interact ion at higher pH (ionised silica) are competing mechanisms. The effect of pH, % ACN, temperature and stationary phase on selectivity was studied by comparing the correlation of plots of k using one condition vs a second condition. The higher the deviation from linearity, the greater is the effect of the condition change on selectivity. Changing the stationary phase was shown to be a powerful tool in influencing selectivity. HILIC was successfully used for bioanalytical purposes for the analysis of catecholamines in urine using electrochemical detection and gives a very good result in order to analyse polar antibiotics in human serum using mass spectrometry detection.

5000|$|Description {{detailing}} the completed building from The Dublin Builder 1 September 1863 This building, {{which may be}} regarded in somewhat the same light as the Spurgeon Tabernacle, has been completed and opened. It was built for the special accommodation of the Rev. Denham Smiths congregation, and is a remarkable structure. The following are the particulars of its features and arrangements : â€”The principal front faces Lower Merrion-street, {{and is in the}} Italian style, three storeys in height, the dimensions from foot-path to top of balustrade being 63 feet. The facade may be said to have three divisions; the centre or principal feature projects from the side-wings containing double staircases leading to the galleries. The lower part of the central projection is a piazza, having large arched openings separated by massive ornamented stone piers. The piazza is 46 feet in length and 9 feet in width, and leads into three internal porches {{in the body of the}} hall, affording shelter from the weather. The piers referred to also support an entablature of frieze and ornamented cornice separating the two lower storeys. The upper part of the centre is composed of Corinthian columns and pilasters supporting main entablature and bold projecting pediment. Both the upper and lower entablatures are continued along side wings on their fronts and flanks, and the angles have handsome moulded and fluted quoins below and pilasters above, corresponding with those in central projection. In the lower storey of the staircase wings are large doors, with stone pilasters and heavy projecting carved hoods, and in the top storey large windows with stone pilasters and pediments, &c., over same. The sides of building facing Harcourt-place and Merrion-square were originally designed to be in character with the front, but have been carried out in a plainer manner, to reduce the expenditure. On the side next Harcourt-place, between the two projecting staircase towers, is a large area, which leads to extensive schools in the basement storey, well lighted and ventilated.The walls of both sides and rear are pierced with four tiers of windows, which light the body of the hall and the galleries and the schools underneath. The materials used in constructing the front and ends are Portland and Caen stone, as well as for the cornices, mouldings, columns, and other dressings, the intermediate spaces being faced with the best white Suffolk bricks, the first, we understand, that have been introduced into this city. The effect obtained with these materials is elegant and striking. The interior of the building is exceedingly imposing. On entering from the street level into the spacious body of the hall, three galleries can be seen, one over the other, continued all round the entire building, and forming the centre part of the hall into an elliptical shape. The great loftiness of the building allows ample space between each of the galleries without in any way interfering with the light from the side windows. The galleries are supported on substantial ornamental cast iron <b>colunms,</b> continued up from basement storey into roof, which they also help to support. The fronts of the galleries are formed into enriched cornices, supporting handsome iron ornamental open pattern balustrades. The platform for the choir and the pulpit platform are placed in front of the galleries at rear of the building, standing out well towards the centre, so that the speaker can be well heard and seen from all parts of the building. The choir floor is at a level, half way between the body or ground floor of hall and first gallery, being sufficiently high to allow the space under it to be occupied on crowded occasions. This affords considerable increased accommodation. The platform is supported on light columns, as also the pulpit which is over the lower platform, its floor being on the same level as the front of lower gallery; both platforms have semicircular fronts, and are enclosed with ornamental metal railings.The floor of the body of hall reclines towards the platform, and the seats are arranged in amphitheatre form, so as that all face the preacher. The building throughout is fitted with permanent comfortable pew sittings of stained wood, the passage approaches being wide and convenient. The means of ingress and egress are most perfect in their arrangement, particular attention having been given to this object by the architect. There are in all ten entrance and exit doors, specially arranged for the convenience of the body of the hall and the galleries, so that the building is capable of being cleared in a few minutes. The three galleries are approached by six different staircases placed at the angles of the building; the front side wings each contain two separate double staircases, one in each being for the lower gallery alone, and the others for the two upper galleries. From their positions in the angles of the hall all crowding will be prevented. The ceiling of the hall is one of its beautiful features. It is deeply coved, and springs from handsomely enriched ornamental foliated capitals of the iron columns supporting the galleries, from which points enriched bands or ribs run up on the cove and on the underside of the arches between the columns, forming a groin at their junction with the arch of the ceiling. Over the centre of the hall in the ceiling there is formed a large compartment for ventilation. It is enclosed externally with sashes appearing above the roof; under those are fixed other sashes of ornamental forms, glazed with amber colour stained glass, which always presents the appearance of the sun shining into the building; the effect of which is novel and pleasing. These sashes are covered over with perforated zinc for protection.The ventilation promises to be most perfect from the amount of attention; that has been bestowed upon it. The sashes in the sides of the ventilating compartment in the roof open for summer ventilation, as also all the window sashes in the side and rear walls; means being also adopted at each of the windows for admitting air without the sashes being opened. The undersides of the galleries, instead of being ceiled flat in the usual manner, are formed into arched coves between the columns and bearers, giving a light and airy effect to the building. The most complete and beautiful arrangements have been made for lighting, warming, and ventilating the building with gas. Round the entire range of galleries are a series of gas pendents so arranged as to carry away the heat and products of combustion by means of horizontal rows of pipes traversing the entire length and breadth of the building. These pipes become intensely heated after the gas has been lighted, and consequently radiate a vast amount of heat. They continue up the side angles of the building, and are connected to the funnels of two large sun-lights which are fixed in the centre of the dome. When the sun-burners are lighted, a draught is at once produced through all the tubes, thereby carrying off all the obnoxious vapours arising from the gas-burners. For ventilation this arrangement is most admirable, for it not only conducts away the foul air from the gas pendents, but also the vitiated atmosphere produced by the respiration of those seated in the building.The view from the galleries is exceedingly fine, no gas-jets are to be seen whatever, but a rich halo of light universally diffused throughout the entire space, showing off the architectural beauty of the edifice. The idea of this combined principle of lighting, warming, and ventilating, originated with Henry Bewley, Esq., who instructed the Messrs. Edmundson and Company, of this city, to carry it into practice. Mr. Alfred G. Jones, of No. 3, Molesworth Street, is the architect, and the contractors are the Messrs. Cockburn and Sons, of Great Brunswick-street, who have executed their contract in an incredibly short time, and in a most substantial and satisfactory manner. The iron work has been done by Mr. Strong, of Hammond-lane. The dimensions of the site are about 85 feet in width by 90 feet in depth, and the building itself covers an area of 6,800 superficial feet. The cost is said to be about Â£16,000, including the fittings, furniture, &c. The building seats about 3,500, and, with standing room, would accommodate 5,000. The two upper galleries are free, as well as some of the pews in the body of the hall, and it is intended to keep 1,500 seats free to the public.|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} results of an {{investigation}} of the effects of Far Ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from hot early type OB stars on clumps in star-forming molecular clouds. Clumps in Photodissociation regions (PDRs) undergo external heating which, if rapid, creates strong photoevaporative mass flows off the clump surfaces, and drives shocks into the clumps, compressing them to high densities. The clumps lose mass on relatively short timescales. The evolution of an individual clump is found to be sensitive to its initial <b>colunm</b> density, the temperature of the heated surface and the ratio of the "turn-on time" t_FUV of the heating flux on a clump to its initial sound crossing-time t_c. In this paper, we use spherical 1 -D numerical hydrodynamic models as well as approximate analytical models to study the evolution of turbulence-generated and pressure-confined clumps in PDRs. Turbulent clumps evolve so that their column densities are equal to a critical value determined by the local FUV field, and typically have short photoevaporation timescales, âˆ¼ 10 ^ 4 - 5 years for a 1 M_ clump in a typical star-forming region. Clumps that are confined by an interclump medium may either get completely photoevaporated, or may preserve a shielded core with a warm, dissociated, protective shell that absorbs the incident FUV flux. We compare our results with observations of some well-studied PDRs: the Orion Bar, M 17 SW, NGC 2023 and the Rosette Nebula. The data are consistent with both interpretations of clump origin, with a slight indication for favouring the turbulent model for clumps over pressure-confined clumps.

40|$|Shear {{has been}} known to exist for many years in the {{topographic}} structure of prirnary visual cortex, but has received little attention in the modeling literature. Although the topographic map of V 1 is largely conformal (i. e. zero shear), several groups have observed topographic shear in the region of the V 1 /V 2 border. Furthennore, shear has also been revealed by anisotropy of cortical magnification factor within a single ocular dominance <b>colunm.</b> In the present paper, we make a functional hypothesis: the major axis of the topographic shear tensor provides cortical neurons with a preferred direction of orientation tuning. We demonstrate that isotropic neuronal summation of a sheared topographic map, in the presence of additional random shear can provide the major features of corlical functional architecture with the ocular dominance column system acting as the principal source of the shear tensor. The major principal axis of the shear tensor determines the direction and its eigenvalues the relative strength of cortical orientation preference. This hypothesis is then shown to be qualitatively consistent with a variety of experimental results on cat and monkey orientation column properties obtained from optical recording and from other anatomical and physiological techniques. In addition, we show that a recent result of (Das and Gilbert, 1997) is consistent with an infinite set of parameterized solutions for the cortical map. We exploit this freedom to choose a particular instance of the Das-Gilbert solution set which is consistent with the full range of local spatial structure in V 1. These results suggest that further relationships between ocular dominance columns, orientation columns, and local topography may be revealed by experimental testing...|$|E
40|$|Polyethylene (PE) sampler uptake was {{compared}} to polychaete uptake to assess bioavailability of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from resuspended sediments in the laboratory. Disequilibrium-corrected PE were found to take up PCBs in nearly a 1 : 1 ratio with polychaete lipid (r 2 = 0. 88), demonstrating that PE samplers are good biomimetic tools in laboratory exposure tests. When dissolved concentrations were calculated based on equilibrium partitioning from both PE and lipid, PE were found to overestimate biota exposure by 3. 6 times on average. PE samplers and polychaetes demonstrated that resuspension under varying water column redox conditions does not affect bioavailability of residual PCBs. In a separate experiment, PE samplers {{used to measure the}} water column during laboratory sediment resuspensions suggested dredging-induced resuspension causes an increase in partitioning of sedimentary PCBs to the aqueous phase. The fraction of release that was freely dissolved versus dissolved organic carbon (DOC) -associated depended on PCB physicochemical characteristics. PE samplers deployed in the field (Newark Bay, NJ) provided freely dissolved and gaseous concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDD/Fs) in the water column and atmosphere and indicated the direction of PCDD/F activity gradients. High surface water-air gradients were found for most PCDD/Fs analyzed, indicating Newark Bay is a source of PCDD/Fs to the New York/New Jersey atmosphere. Water <b>colunm</b> gradients were variable but generally close to one, suggesting the water column is well mixed with respect to PCDD/Fs. Porewater-water column gradients were also generally close to one for low MW PCDD/Fs, but greater than one {{in the direction of the}} water column for high MW PCDD/Fs, indicating that sediment porewater is a net source of high MW PCDD/Fs to the water column. The uptake of PCDD/Fs by PE samplers tumbled in the laboratory with Newark Bay sediment {{was compared}} to PCDD/F uptake by native biota collected from the Bay. PE- and lipid-based partitioning suggested that PE were underestimating the porewater concentrations that biota are exposed to by âˆ¼ 3 times. ...|$|E

This dissertation describes novel designs of fritless capillary columns prepared for capillary electrochromatography (CEC) and micro liquid chromatography (micro LC). Designed especially for CEC, the first class of monolithic <b>colunm</b> presented here comprises the entrapped columns. These are made by trapping particles of chromatographic packing material in a fine network of a silicate or organic based polymer. Due to the simple composition of the entrapment matrix, straightforward manufacturing procedure and modest equipment requirement, the method can readily be transferred to any laboratory and easily automated. Elimination of frits, stabilization of the packed bed and on-the-fly customization of column length render mechanically robust columns that are remarkably stable over time, from which manufacturing imperfections can be easily removed. As the water glass entrapment matrix initially studied was replaced by so! gel derived polymers or organic based polymers, the entrapment procedure was gradually improved, demonstrating minimal influence on the structure and chromatographic properties of the original reverse phase sorbent. High efficiency separations were obtained in both CEC and micro LC formats. This immobilization method was also used to prepare chiral CEC columns by entrapping a molecular imprinted polymeric (MIP) packing having minimal surface charge density, thus being unable to support electroosmotic flow (EOF) without the entrapment matrix. A new type of monolithic stationary phase in which silica beads dictate the porosity of the polymer was also developed. The interstitial space of a chromatographic bed made of silica beads was filled with a mixture of monomers and crosslinker and polymerization was thermally initiated. Subsequent washing of the polymeric rod with an alkaline solution rendered a porous monolith that was used for both micro LC and CEC...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 The Horsetail Creek (HC) {{bridge is}} an example of an Oregon bridge that was {{classified}} as structurally deficient and was not designed to withstand earthquake (EQ) excitations. A fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) rehabilitation was performed on the HC bridge to increase flexural and shear capacities for traffic loads. However, a seismic retrofit has not yet been accomplished for this bridge. Fully three-dimensional finite element (FE) models are developed to simulate and examine the structural behavior of both full-size reinforced concrete (RC) beams and the HC bridge using ANSYS. FE analyses are compared with tests of full-scale beams replicating the transverse beams of the HC bridge before and after FRP strengthening from linear and nonlinear ranges up to failure. The FE models can effectively predict the behavior of the beams, and analytical and experimental results correlate very well. For the FE analyses of the HC bridge, soil-structure interface modeling is incorporated to replicate the actual bridge boundary conditions. Truck loadings are applied to the FE model at different locations, as in the actual bridge test. A sensitivity study is performed by varying uncertain bridge parameters to develop an FE bridge model best representing the actual bridge conditions. The optimal FE model obtained from the sensitivity study can accurately predict the magnitudes and trends in the strains. After an optimal FE bridge model is established, a performance evaluation on the FRP strengthening of the HC bridge is conducted. Both unstrengthened and FRP-strengthened bridge models are subjected to two different types of loading; i. e., scaled gravity and scaled truck loads to failure. Comparisons of results show the improvement in structural performance due to FRP strengthening. A seismic risk-related investigation of the HC bridge is also carried out. Nonlinear time-history analyses are performed using EQ acceleration-time histories applied to the HC bridge model. The ground motions are appropriate to the Pacific Northwest site and scaled so that the response spectrum, within natural periods of interest, matches the 1996 AASHTO design response spectrum. Based on the analytical results, <b>colunm</b> confinement is recommended to increase ductility and reduce potential for substructure collapse in future seismic events...|$|E

ChemistryBibliography: leaves 177 - 183 The tricarbonylchromium {{complexes}} of some metalloporphins {{have been}} synthesized and studied. The tricarbonylchromium complexes of 1 st transition series metal porphines were prepared by refluxing hexacarbonylchromium and metal porphine {{in an atmosphere}} of pure nitrogen for 6 hours. After the preliminary studies by thin-layer chromatography on dried products the purification was done on a florisil <b>colunm</b> under nitrogen using different eluents for different compounds; in most of the cases the chromatographic technique for purification was successful. The purity of the purified products was tested by ultra violet/visible and infra red spectroscopy. The visible region spectrum of the complex had a blue or red shift in the bands as compared to starting material (metal porphine) : in most cases, if the product was impure bands were mixed and broad. The infra red of pure product always had very distinct carbonyl peaks: if the compound was decomposed no CO stretching vibrations were observed. [...] The structures of the complexes were established with the help of infra red, ultra violet and n. m. r [...] The elemental analysis confirmed the structure although the elemental analyses were not correct in some compounds due to their unstability. â€“ Tetraphenylporphine, p-substituted porphine and metalloporphines have been studied spectroscopically (UV/visible 1 R) and theoretically. Zerner and Gouterman have done extended Huckel calculations on porphine systems with the metals Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn. These calculations help in understanding the electronic structure of metalporphine.

[...] The CO stretching vibrations in all the complexes depend upon the Ï€ electron distribution in the metal porphines. A decrease of Ï€ electron distribution will increase the CO stretching vibration values and an increase of Ï€ electron distribution will decrease the CO stretching vibration values.

40|$|Uncorrected OCR) Abstract of thesis {{entitled}} NOVEL ASPECTS OF AUTOCRINEIP ARACRINE REGULATION OF GROWTH HORMONE SECRETION AND SYNTHESIS IN GRASS CARP PITUITARY CELLS Submitted by ZHOUHONG for {{the degree}} of Doctor of Philosophy at The University of Hong Kong in March 2003 In this study, autocrine/paracrine regulation of growth hormone (GH) synthesis and secretion by local interactions of gonadotrophs and somatotrophs was examined in vitro in pituitary cells prepared from Chinese grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus). Treatment with exogenous OH and gonadotropin (OTH) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in basal GH release, GH production, and GH mRNA levels. However, the opposite effects were observed by removing endogenous OR and OTH using immunoneutralization. Furthermore, GR and OTH immunoneutralizations at the pituitary level were effective in blocking the stimulatory influence on GH mRNA expression induced by GH-releasing factors in fish, including GnRH, dopamine, and PACAP 38 ï¿½Apparently" GH-induced GH gene expression was mediated by increasing the T 1 / 2 ofGH mRNA in the cytoplasm and enhancing the production of GH primary transcripts in the nucleus. Since GH-induced OR mRNA gene expression could be blocked by inhibiting JAK 2, P 42144 MAPK, P 38 MAPK, and PI 3 K, {{it is likely that}} the JAK/MAPK and JAK/PI 3 K pathways are involved in the GH receptor signaling. Similarly, exogenous GTH increased the production ofGH primary transcripts. However, it did not improve OR mRNA stability but rather enhanced the turnover of GH transcripts. GTR also increased cAMP production in carp pituitary cells. GTH-induced GH mRNA expression Was mimicked by activating cAMP synthesis and blocked by inhibiting adenylate cyclase (AC) and PKA [...] GTH-induced OR mRNA expression was also sensitive to inhibition of JAKz, P 42 / 44 MAPK, P 3 SM. AP 1 C and PI 3 K. Similar inhibitions, except for PI 3 K, were all effective in blocking OR mRNA expression induced by activation of cAMP synthesis. These results indicate that GTH may induce GR gene expression through the AC/ cAMP/PKA pathway secondary coupled to JAK. 2 andlor MAPK. Apparently, a cAMP-independent PI 3 K component is also involved in the post-receptor signaling. Using a <b>colunm</b> perifusion approach, the dynamic interactions between somaotrophs and gonadotrophs were examined. In this case, exogenous OTR induced a rapid rise in basal GH secretion, whereas exogenous GR was found to inhibit basal GTR release. In parallel studies, GTHinduced OR mRNA expression was abolished by OR immunoneutralization. Similarly, GTR immunoneutralization blocked GR-induced OR mRNA expression in carp pituitary cells. These results, as a whole, indicate that endogenously secreted OH and GTR, besides their functions as endocrine hormones, serve as novel autocrine/paracrine factors at the pituitary level to modulate GH secretion, OH production, OH gene expression, and somatotroph sensitivity to stimulation by hypothalamic regulators. These stimulatory influences of GH and GTR on OR gene expression axe exerted at the level of GR rnRNA stability and OH gene transcription, presumably via a direct coupling to the JAK/MAPK and JAKiPI 3 K cascades or an indirect coupling via the AC/cAMP/PKA pathway. Apparently, a local il 1 trapituitary feedback loop is present. In this case, GTH released from gonadotrophs stimulates GH secretion in neighboring somatotrophs. GR release from somatotrophs is essential to maintain basal GH synthesis and secretion and also exerts a negative feedback on basal GTB release. This intrapituitary feedback loop formed by local interactions between gonadotrophs and somatotrophs may represent a novel mechanism to control OR gene expression in lower vertebrates. abstracttocZoologyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

A quantitative sampler, which samples the total macroinvertebrate assemblages of P. oceanica beds, was designed and tested to determine the appropriate area and number of sampling units required to achieve given levels of accuracy and precision.

Para a coluna spray, o hold-up da fase dispersa e o coeficiente global de transferÃªncia de massa (KD a) foram avaliados para diferentes velocidades superficiais da fase leve. Os resultados indicaram que um aumento na velocidade {{superficial}} da fase dispersa na faixa de O - 0, 18 mm/s apresentou um efeito positivo sobre o KD a e hold-up. Para a coluna de pratos perfurados foi observado que o aumento da velocidade superficial da fase dispersa e no nÃºmero de pratos tambÃ©m promoveu um aumento nos dois parÃ¢metros de extraÃ§Ã£o da coluna. A seletividade de separaÃ§Ã£o da xilanase e albumina de soro bovino, BSA, (contaminante modelo) foi alta, pois cerca de 60 % da enzima foi extraÃ­da para a fase leve, enquanto uma quantidade insignificante de BSA foi obtida nesta fase. A possibilidade de usar a coluna de pratos e recheada na operaÃ§Ã£o contÃ­nua e contra-corrente para a extraÃ§Ã£o da enzima tambÃ©m foi avaliada. Foram estudadas a influÃªncia de diferentes tipos de recheio como os anÃ©is de Raschig, esferas de vidro e anÃ©is de poliestireno assim como a razÃ£o da velocidade superficial da fase leve (pEG) e pesada (sal). A melhor seletividade foi obtida com os anÃ©is de poliestireno 94 % da xilanase na fase polimÃ©rica enquanto apenas 3 % do contaminante foi obtido nesta fase. Em uma segunda parte deste trabalho explorou-se o SDF A contendo apenas um copolÃºnero termossensÃ­vel em um processo em batelada. Foram utilizados copolÃ­meros randÃ´micos contendo grupos de Ã³xido de etileno (EO) e Ã³xido de propileno (PO) hidrofobicamente modificados, sendo que a modificaÃ§Ã£o foi realizada atravÃ©s da inserÃ§Ã£o de grupos hidrofÃ³bicos alifÃ¡ticos C 1 JI 29 nas duas pontas do polÃ­mero. Neste sistema a fase superior Ã© enriquecida em Ã¡gua e a fase inferior no polÃ­mero (cerca de 6 - 8 %, p/p). A melhor separaÃ§Ã£o do DNA e do plasmÃ­deo utilizando o copolÃ­mero hidrofÃ³bicabicamente modificado (HM-EOPO) carregado positivamente foi obtido usando uma baixa forÃ§a iÃ´nica a pH 8.

For the spray column, the dispersed phase hold-up and overall mass transfer coefficients (Ko a) were evaluated for different superficial velocities of the dispersed phase (light phase). Resuhs indicated that an increase in superficial velocity {{in the range of}} O - 0. 18 mmls of the dispersed phase had a positive effect on KD a and on hold-up in all <b>colunm</b> heights studied, 75, 161 and 246 mm. For the sieve plate column, the effect ofthe superficial velocity ofthe dispersed phase and number of plates were also studied. Results showed that the KD a and hold-up increased with an increase in both parameters. The selectivity of separation of xylanase and BSA (model contaminant) was very high, since 60 % of the enzyme was extracted in the light phase, whereas no significant amount of BSA was extracted. The possibility of using the sieve plate and packed column in continuous operations for enzyme extraction was studied. The influence of several kinds of packings, Raschig rings, glass spheres and polyestirene rings was studied as well as the superficial velocity ratio of the salt and PEG phases. The best selectivity was obtained with the polyestirene ring whith 94 % of xylanase recovery in the polimeric phase and just 3 % of contaminant was recovery to this phase. In a second part of this work a system composed by a thermoseparating hydrophobica 11 y modified polymers (HM-EOPO) has been used in one-polymer extraction systems, where the top phase is enriched by water and the bottom phase is enriched by the polymer (about 6 - 8 %, w/w). The best separation ofDNA ftom plasmid was obtained using a low ionic system at pH 8 when the polymer is positively charged. By using salts that do not produce electrochemica 1 driving force in the system contained HM-EOPO copolymer it is possible to distinguish other driving forces acting on the partitioning of biomolecules.

Arsenic exists in nature in the oxidation states +V (arsenate), +III (arsenite), 0 (arsenic) and -III (arsine). Commonly inorganic arsenic appears {{in the aqueous environment}} in the states +V and +III as arsenous acid (As(III)), arsenic acid (As(V)), and their salts. It is usually found in the environment combined with the elements such as oxygen, chlorine, and sulfur. Arsenic combined with these elements is called inorganic arsenic. On the other hand if arsenic combined with carbon and hydrogen is called organic arsenic. Inorganic arsenic compounds can be methylated by bacteria, fungi, and yeasts to the organic compounds such as monomethylarsenic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and arsine. Arsenic compounds are used in wood preservation and insecticides, as an additive to lead and copper for hardening, glass manufacturing, in small quantities in semi-conductor manufacturing. Arsenic is carcinogenic and may cause lung cancer, bladder cancer, liver cancer, renal cancer, and skin cancer. It is also harmful to the nervous system. Other health effects may include vessel damage, high blood pressure, anemia, stomach sickness, and diabetes. The toxicity of arsenic depends on its binding form. Organic arsenic compounds are less toxic than inorganic arsenic compounds. It has been estimated that {{tens of millions of people}} are at risk exposing to excessive levels of arsenic from both contaminated water and arsenic-bearing coal from natural sources. Humans are exposed to this toxic by breathing, eating, or drinking the substance, or by skin contact. The current World Health Organization recommended value for arsenic in drinking water is 0. 010 mg/Land in wastewater is 0, 5 mg/L. Arsenic cannot be destroyed in the environment. It can only change its form, or become attached to or separated from particles. Therefore it is one of the main problems considering underground and ground source waters in recent years, because of its toxicity and carcinogenic. On the other side, aluminium is the second-most used metal after steel, largely because of its use in a wide variety of products. It is estimated that aluminium composes about 8 % of the earth s crust. Aluminium is a light silvery-white metallic element and it is resistant to corrosion. it is very reactive but forms a tough layer of oxide when exposed to air, preventing further corrosion and it is ductile and easily malleable. It is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity. Aluminium is used electrical equipments such as car, ship, aircraft construction; metallurgical and chemical processes; domestic and industrial construction; packaging and kitchen utensils. Aluminium is non-toxic (as the metal) nonmagnetic and non-sparking. It occurs naturally in many foods in very concentrations and is also present in many pharmaceuticals and drinking water. High levels in the body can be toxic. Production of aluminium from ore is dependent upon alumina, which is extracted from bauxite ore which contains 30 - 60 % alumina. The production of alumina consumes more than 90 % of the world s production of bauxite. The main minerals in bauxite are gibbsite (Al 203. 3 H 20), boehmite (Al 203. H 20), and diaspore. Bauxite ore refers to bauxite that contains sufficiently high levels of Al 203 and suitably low levels of Fe 203 and silica to be economically mineable. Red Mud is a waste left after alumina has been extracted from bauxite in Bayer process for refining bauxites into alumina via digestion with sodium hydroxide. This process can be separated into two parts; firstly the extraction of alumina from bauxite, and secondly the smelting of aluminum metal from alumina. Sodium hydroxide is used to dissolve the aluminum oxide. This produces a sodium-aluminium solutionfrom precipitated &# 12310;Al(OH) &# 12311;_ 3. Afterwards it is calcined to produce oxide, from which the metal is recovered. The remaining waste product of bayer process is called red mud due to the colour of the original bauxite ore and the iron oxide it contains. In addition to iron, it contains other particles include silica, unleached residual aluminium, and titanium oxide. For each tonne of alumina produced, the process can leave behind about two tonnes of red mud. However, This ratio is dependent on the type of bauxite used in the refining process. The red mud is a complex chemical soup, a watery slurry of fine rock particles and salts, containing toxic heavy metals. The red mud also has a high pH because of the sodium hydroxide solution used in the refining process. Therefore it is strong enough to kill plant and animal life, and to cause burns and damage to airways if it is breathed. Parallel to the increase in population and urbanization, the demand of aluminum is also increasing and as a consequence, storage and removing red mud becomes more and more important for the facilities produce aluminum. Therefore, cosidering the facts of both arsenic and red mud issues, in this study, the influence of red mud on removing arsenic from waters is investigated. The aim was, by using red mud as a low cost adsorbent, having a good efficiency of arsenic removal from waters and waste waters. Primarily, optimal pH for arsenic removal, stiring duration, and amount of red mud are determined. In the course of this study in a range from pH 2. 5 to pH 10 have been studied in many different values and the best in synthetic absorbable s concentration of arsenic is observed at pH 5. 5. Also it has been concluded that even 0, 5 gr/L red mud is enough effective for arsenic removal at pH 5, 5 with a concentration of 10 ppm arsenic. In other experiment, instead of synthetic arsenic, 38, 5 ppm arsenic contaminated water taken from Eti Mine Emet Boron facilityis used. The experiment performed in the original pH 9 and despite incresing the amount of red mud, good results couldn t be achieved which shows the importance of pH arrangement in the arsenic removal process. This study also investigates different arsenic concentrations, enough high yields is obtained up to 100 ppm. In order to increase the arsenic efficiency the heat, acid, and red mud are activated at concentrations as high as 100 ppm. While desired results could not be obtained by acid activation, with heat activation at 600 Â°C the yield increase is achieved with high concentrations. Pyrite is another adsorbant to remove arsenic. Although pyrite s removal effect together with red mud has been elaborated as well, it has been found that red mud alone is more effective to remove arsenic. In order to apply the data obtained by sentetic arsenic concentration to the waste water, some experiments has been conducted with natural pH 9 and 38, 5 ppm arsenic concentration obtained by Eti Maden Emet boron facility. As a result, it has been determined that at natural pH value, even 4 gr/L of red mud is not enough, but the yield quite rises at pH 5. It has been also worked with another waste sample from Eti Maden Emet boron facility which has a 81, 66 ppm arsenicconcentration. With this sample, it has been tried to see the effects of the amount of red mud in arsenic removal with a value of pH 5 in wastewater. As a result, with 4 gr/L red mud, it has been able to reduce the arsenic concentration to a level below 0, 5 ppm, which is the limit for permitted levels of arsenic in waste waters. For the application and the transportation with ease, red mud transformed to the red mud pellets by using starch. The adsorption experiments in a <b>colunm</b> system with two different size of these pellets show that with the fine pellets, better results are obtained. While the course sized pellet has a 42 % of arsenic removal efficiency in the samples taken after 30 minutes, the fine sized pellet has about 60 % of arsenic removal efficieny. On the other hand, these efficiencies are reduced with increasing sampling time. When the fine sized pellets are worked with the real arsenic contaminated water taken from Emet boron facility, about 80 % of arsenic removal efficiency is achieved. As a result, red mud which is the biggest waste problem of aluminum production either with the storage necessity or the disposal difficulties, is used for removing arsenic from the waters within the scope of waste utilization.
