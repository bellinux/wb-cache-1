Extreme value theory (EVT) is a branch of statistics that is concerned with modelling extremal events, and is therefore appealing for use with novelty detection. However, conventional existing EVT approaches are limited to the analysis of univariate or low-dimension data. This paper considers the peaks-over-threshold method of EVT, in which exceedances over a (typically univariate) threshold can be shown to tend towards the generalised Pareto distribution (GPD). We extend this method for use with high-dimensional data, allowing us to reason about the "extreme" data lying in the tails of the distributions of complex, real-world datasets, which are typically multivariate and multimodal.

The main contribution {{of this paper is}} the development of effective information agents which can autonomously classify and filter incoming electronic data on behalf of their human users. The proposed information agents are innovative because they can quickly classify electronic documents solely based on the short titles of these documents. Moreover, supervised learning is not required to train the <b>classification</b> <b>models</b> <b>of</b> these agents. Document classification is based on information inference conducted over a high dimensional semantic information space.
