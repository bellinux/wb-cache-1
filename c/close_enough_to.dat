5|$|A New Jersey {{hurricane}} is {{a tropical}} cyclone {{originating in the}} Atlantic Ocean that affects the state of New Jersey. Due to its location, few hurricanes have hit the state directly, though numerous hurricanes have passed near or through New Jersey in its history. About every 10years, hurricanes approach the coastline <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> send waves over barrier islands' dunes and into back bays. According to an estimate by meteorologist George Prouflis, the chances for a direct hit by a hurricane on the Jersey shore each year is 1 in 200.|$|E
5|$|A near-Earth {{supernova}} is {{a supernova}} <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> the Earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere. Depending upon {{the type and}} energy of the supernova, {{it could be as}} far as 3000light-years away. Gamma rays from a supernova would induce a chemical reaction in the upper atmosphere converting molecular nitrogen into nitrogen oxides, depleting the ozone layer enough to expose the surface to harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. This has been proposed as the cause of the Ordovician–Silurian extinction, which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Although Bellone would {{normally}} be much faster than the large British warship, the light winds and Rattlesnakes determined pursuit prevented the privateer from escaping and at 17:00, Powerful was <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> open fire. Despite the uneven nature of the combat, Bellone unexpectedly resisted the British attack for another hour and 45 minutes, causing more damage to Powerful than she received herself. The privateer was later taken into British service as a sixth rate frigate and prize money was paid for the captured vessels, but the action prompted questions in subsequent histories {{about the lack of}} efficiency in British gunnery.|$|E

Despite the illumination on the French ship, Sybilles sails were clearly identified on Forte but Beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action: he seems to have thought that the sails belonged to an approaching East Indiaman despite the concerns of his officers, or that he wished to lure Sybille <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> ensure its defeat in the coming engagement.|$|E

5|$|Free-fed feral {{cats and}} house cats tend to consume many small meals {{in a single}} day, {{although}} the frequency and size of meals varies between individuals. Cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an animal comes <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be captured. Although it is not certain, the strategy used may depend on the prey species in the area, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} the {{electrons}} are <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> thermal equilibrium that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even {{when there is a}} significant deviation from a Maxwellian energy distribution function, for example, due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric fields. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.|$|E

A Q-ship was a merchant ship with hidden weaponry, commanded secretly by the navy and manned by a Royal Navy crew. When attacked by a submarine, the Q-ship would feign damage until the enemy was <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> engage and then reveal its weapons to counter-attack. Campbell, a major proponent of Q-ship strategy, was impressed with Stuart's stubborn refusal to accept the two years of rejection and brought him in to replace an officer whose nerves had cracked under the strain of Q-ship operations.|$|E

5|$|Nina {{never made}} {{landfall}} while active, although some forecasts called for Nina {{to be the}} first hurricane to make landfall on Hawaii, but the hurricane veered west before landing. However, it came <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> Hawaii to cause light damage and prompt evacuations. Nina was the first hurricane to affect the island of Kauai at that intensity. This storm was preceded by a winter storm that caused damaging surf along the north coast of Kauai and was both preceded and proceeded by cold fronts sweeping over Hawaii.|$|E

Delores, Ignacio and Marty threatened the coast of Mexico, coming <b>close</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> require tropical cyclone watches and warnings.
