5|$|Electricity {{interconnection}} between Sabah, the Indonesian {{province of}} North Kalimantan and the Philippine province of Palawan {{are also in}} the process as part of the BIMP-EAGA; with the interconnection with Palawan is expected to be completed in 2018. Since 2007, there is an attempt to establish a <b>coal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> in Lahad Datu which receiving opposition from local residents and non-governmental organisations for the pollution that would be caused by the plant. Thus Sabah has start to exploring alternative ways to generate electricity with the usage of renewable energy such as solar, mini hydro, biomass, geothermal and micro-algae and tidal technologies. The Japanese government has extended aid totalling RM172,190.93 for the solar electrification project in the island of Larapan in Sabah's east coast in 2010. In 2016, Malaysia's first geothermal plant was started to be developed in Tawau to boost electricity in the east coast after a research by United States GeothermEx Inc. and Jacobs New Zealand indicated the existence of an active geothermal system centred around the flanks of Mount Maria on Apas Kiri. A South Korean company GS Caltex also sets to built Malaysia's first bio-butanol plant in the state.|$|E

40|$|The Indian {{power sector}} {{relies heavily on}} <b>coal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> for {{electricity}} generation as 59 % of the total installed capacity is from <b>coal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> Considerable {{research has been done}} in developed countries to analyze the suitability of CO 2 capture technologies for <b>coal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> but not in India. This work analyzes the suitability of various CO 2 capture technologies for Indian <b>coal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> on the basis of different parameters: energy penalty, cost of CO 2 capture, efficiency, and age and size of the <b>power</b> <b>plant.</b> An Integrated Environmental Control Model (IECM) was used to simulate the <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> and to calculate the energy penalty and cost of capture. All existing 517 units of 115 <b>coal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> in India, along with one Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant and one ultra-supercritical plant were analyzed for CO 2 capture suitability. Results show that the total installed capacity of Indian <b>coal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> would reduce to somewhere between 66 896 and 105 991 MW, depending on the CO 2 capture technology applied, from and existing 126 320 MW. The average efficiency of Indian <b>coal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> would reduce from the current 29 % to 24. 4 %, 20. 7 %, and 15. 4 % if we retrofit the plants with amine-, ammonia-, and membrane-based capture systems, respectively. Cost of CO 2 capture for these three technologies would be $ 42. 3, $ 75. 2, and $ 81. 9 per tonne of CO 2, respectively. The CO 2 capture technologies would be better off on <b>coal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> which are less than 20 years old, as the energy penalty would be less.

25|$|The city of Asheville {{is home to}} a Duke Energy Progress <b>coal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> near Lake Julian. This {{power plant}} is {{designated}} as having Coal Combustion Residue Surface Impoundments with a High Hazard Potential by the EPA. In 2012 a Duke University study found high levels of arsenic and other toxins in North Carolina lakes and rivers downstream from the Asheville power plants coal ash ponds. Samples collected from coal ash waste flowing from the ponds at the Duke Energy Progress plant to the French Broad River in Buncombe County contained arsenic levels more than four times higher than the EPA drinking water standard, and levels of selenium 17 times higher than the agency's standard for aquatic life. In March 2013 the State of North Carolina sued Duke Energy Progress in order to address similar environmental compliance issues. In July 2013 Duke Energy Corp. and North Carolina environmental regulators proposed a settlement in the lawsuit that stated coal ash threatened Asheville's water supply. The settlement called for Duke to assess the sources and extent of contamination at the Riverbend power plant in Asheville. Duke would be fined $99,100 if the settlement is approved. Following the coal ash spill in Eden, NC resulting in 82,000 tons of coal ash leaking into the Dan River, the North Carolina DENR cancelled all previous settlements with Duke Energy. Duke said a stormwater drainage pipe under the utility's Dan River Steam Station lagoon ruptured Feb 2, allowing ash slurry to pour into the river. Duke Energy faces future legislation by Tom Apodaca, republican NCGA Senate leader forcing them to clean up their south Asheville coal ash ponds. Tom Apodaca expects the legislation will be filed as soon as the General Assembly returns to session in May 2014. Apodaca expects the ponds will be cleaned up in 5–10 years under his law.|$|E

2500|$|CFLs, {{like all}} {{fluorescent}} lamps, contain {{small amounts of}} mercury, as both vapor and droplets inside the glass tubing, averaging 4.0mg per bulb. The inclusion of liquid mercury is specifically prohibited from other domestic products in some jurisdictions, notably Europe. [...] Safe cleanup of broken compact fluorescent lamps is different from cleanup of conventional broken glass or incandescent bulbs. After a proper cleanup, any potential short term exposure offers no significant health risks to adults, including pregnant women, or to children. If all electricity was generated by a <b>coal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> (which produce about half the electricity the U.S. consumes) and fluorescent light bulbs were all recycled with no mercury being lost, nearly 75% less mercury could be released in power plant emissions if incandescent bulbs were replaced by fluorescents, and with significantly less total mercury release even if no recycling occurred. However, a concern is that broken bulbs will introduce the mercury directly into a populated indoor area. Though more recent analysis indicates that the concerns about mercury release from broken bulbs may be overstated, and can be ameliorated by taking a few simple steps.|$|E
