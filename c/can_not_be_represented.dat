Bidirectional Texture Functions (BTF) allow {{high quality}} {{visualization}} of real world materials exhibiting complex appearance and details that <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> faithfully <b>represented</b> using simpler analytical or parametric representations. Accurate representations of such materials require {{huge amounts of}} data, hindering real time rendering.

Scalability with respect to the geometric complexity, amount of lights and number of BTFs is also studied. ...|$|R

It would be beneficial if the object-oriented model would support the specification of all relevant types of relations within the model, including application-domain specific relation types. Therefore, we propose a mechanism, implemented in LayOM [...] an extended object model, that supports the specification of all types of relations between objects within the model as components of the object model.
