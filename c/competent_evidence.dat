The most important single parameter affecting the time course of this expression process was found to be the cell concentration. Constant high levels of competence could be maintained in cultures growing in a continuous-dilution device. The expression of competence seems to occur through a specific induction process “catalyzed” by a macromolecular cell product—the activator substance. Under most growth conditions, the availability of endogenous activator seems to limit the expression of competence. An “autocatalytic” production of activator ensues during the activation of cells to the <b>competent</b> state. <b>Evidence</b> is presented for physiological influences affecting the cell's capacity to react with the activator.
