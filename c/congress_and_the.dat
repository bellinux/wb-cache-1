5|$|By 1970 these {{differences}} {{had not been}} resolved, and Brezhnev postponed the 24th Party <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ninth Five-Year Plan (1971–1975). The delay in resolving these issues led to rumours circulating in Soviet society that Kosygin, or even Brezhnev, would lose their posts to Podgorny.
