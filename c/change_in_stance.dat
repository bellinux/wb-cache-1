5|$|In 2014 under {{chairman}} Tom Wheeler, the FCC {{began to}} increase its scrutiny {{regarding the use of}} such agreements—particularly joint sales—to evade its policies. On March 31, 2014, the commission voted to make joint sales agreements count as ownership if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time for its partner, and to ban coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the top four stations in a market. Wheeler indicated that he planned to address local marketing and shared services agreements in the future. The <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>stance</b> also prompted changes to then-proposed acquisitions by Gray Television and Sinclair Broadcast Group, who, rather than use sharing agreements to control them, moved their existing programming and network affiliations to digital subchannels of existing company-owned stations in the market, and then relinquished control over them by selling the stations to minority-owned broadcasters intending to operate them independently.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of trunk extensor muscles in the thoracic and lumbar regions during postural adjustments in the freely standing cat. The epaxial extensor muscles participate in the rapid postural responses evoked by horizontal translation of the support surface. The muscles segregate into two regional groups separated by a short transition zone, according to the spatial pattern of the electromyographic (EMG) responses. The upper thoracic muscles (T 5 - 9) respond best to posteriorly directed translations, whereas the lumbar muscles (T 13 to L 7) respond best to anterior translations. The transition group muscles (T 10 - 12) respond to almost all translations. Muscles group according to vertebral level rather than muscle species. The upper thoracic muscles <b>change</b> little <b>in</b> their response with <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>stance</b> distance (fore-hindpaw separation) and may act to stabilize the intervertebral angles of the thoracic curvature. Activity in the lumbar muscles increases along with upward rotation of the pelvis (iliac crest) as stance distance decreases. Lumbar muscles appear to stabilize the pelvis {{with respect to the}} lumbar vertebrae (L 7 -sacral joint). The transition zone muscles display a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> spatial tuning with stance distance, responding to many directions of translation at short distances and focusing to respond best to contralateral translations at the long stance distance...|$|R

However, knee joint kinematic <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>stance</b> phase during different running conditions in an out-of-laboratory setup has not been explored. The aim of this study was to evaluate three dimensional <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> knee kinematics among habitual shod runners outside of gait laboratory during shod and barefoot running. Methods: Using unobtrusive body-worn sensors mounted to anatomical segments, kinematic data were acquired in twelve healthy young individuals (Age 22. 5 ± 2. 2 years, BMI 21. 4 ± 2. 0 Kg/m 2). Several kinematic parameters were compared between shod and barefoot running including three dimensional knee joint range of motion, tibia internal-external rotation, knee medial-lateral impact, stride time, flight time, contact time and shock propagation time. Results: With no significant difference (p= 0. 21) in running speed between the two running conditions, significant reduction (6. 4 %, p= 0. 005) in flexion-extension range and increase (8. 4 %, p= 0. 0001) in internal-external rotation range of knee joint was observed during barefoot running compared to shod.

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] This study {{examined}} {{the correlation between the}} muscle activities and joint angle of the hip and knee according to the <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>stance</b> width during a lifting task. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects of this study were 15 healthy students. A three-dimensional motion analyzer (SMART-E, BTS, Italy) was used to measure the joint angles of hip and knee during lifting. An 8 -channel electromyograph (8 -EMG) (Pocket EMG, BTS, Italy) was used to measure muscle activities of the erector spinae, gluteus maximus, rectus femoris, and tibialis anterior during lifting. The collected data were analyzed using the Pearson-test and SPSS 18. 0. [Result] The muscle activity of the tibialis anterior was significantly decreased by increasing the stance width (r = − 0. 285). Muscle activity of the erector spinae was significantly decreased by increasing the knee angle (r = − 0. 444). The muscle activity of the gluteus maximus was significantly increased by increasing the muscle activity of the tibialis anterior (r = 0. 295). [Conclusion] Efficient lifting is possible when stance width and knee flexion are increased, which results in reduced muscle activity of the tibialis anterior and the erector spinae. Lifting is facilitated when the muscle activities of the gluteus maximus and tibialis anterior are correlated...|$|R
