40|$|A seized {{lube pump}} of a {{helicopter}} was investigated. Examination revealed that the pump got seized due to seizure at the 2 nd stage rotor and <b>centering</b> <b>plate</b> interface. Evidences suggest that the seizure was caused due to adhesive wear resulting from the debris generated in-situ. It has been established that constant rubbing of the 2 nd stage rotor key with the <b>centering</b> <b>plate</b> {{was responsible for the}} generation of debris. Factors such as improper lubrication or entrapment of foreign particles as the causes of failure have been ruled out. Analysis showed that with the present design of the rotor keys, such seizure in the lube pump is unavoidable. It is recommended that the rotor keys be redesigned so that the contacts between the keys and the <b>centering</b> <b>plate</b> are avoided. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report...|$|E

40|$|On the Latvian railway, {{derailments}} of {{freight cars}} {{take place in}} the course of shunting work on marshalling yards. A number of factors during shunting work on marshalling yards may contribute to the derailments of rolling stock: longitudinal dynamics during braking of cars with the turned off brakes by locomotive, hauling down cars from a marshalling hill with braking position controlled by an operator, dry internal rails in curves, absence of greasing in the pivot unit of freight bogies. At present, measures allowing elimination of the car derailments during shunting work are developed. During the period between repairs, the abutment unit of freight car often works in conditions of dry friction. Our observations suggest {{that at the time of}} taking a car into repair, there is often an absence of greasing between trail bearing and <b>center</b> <b>plate</b> of the abutment, and a presence of sandy dust. It increases a friction and, together with high contact pressures and dynamic influence, hinders the turn of bogie at motion of car. In this paper, the results of studying the resisting moment in the abutment to turning of bogie is reported. The study was conducted on the basis of freight bogie of type 18 - 100; the body was leant on the <b>center</b> <b>plate</b> unit of the abutment, on the <b>center</b> <b>plate</b> unit, and on the sliders. Experiments were conducted, with the use of greasing and at the dry friction of <b>center</b> <b>plate</b> unit...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to improve the railcar/rail truck interface by developing a low maintenance bearing interface with a favorable friction coefficient. Friction and wear at the <b>center</b> bowl/center <b>plate</b> bearing interface cause high turning moments around curved track, wear of truck components, and increased detrimental dynamic effects. The recommended improvement of the rail truck interface is a set of two steel inserts, one concave and one convex, that can be retrofit to <b>center</b> bowls/center <b>plates.</b> The insert geometry addresses concerns about maintaining favorable pressure distribution on existing components, minimizing overall height increase to accommodate existing infrastructure, and retaining railcar stability. The stability of the railcar upon the design inserts has been ensured when the instantaneous center of rotation of the railcar body is above the railcar center of gravity. The damping ratio provided by the frictional moment within center bowl is 240 and eliminates the possibility of dynamic amplification. Using a 90 inch radius of curvature ensures stability and requires a 0. 5 inch diameter reduction of the existing <b>center</b> <b>plate</b> for a gap of 1 / 16 inch. The increase in railcar height for the specific design is 0. 71 inches which can be absorbed by either grinding of the <b>center</b> <b>plate</b> or new manufacturing dimensions. The design is feasible for small travel values corresponding to small vertical gaps at the side bearings. In addition to geometry alterations, the bearing surfaces are coated with a protective metallic layer. The literature suggests that optimum friction coefficients between bearing elements in the <b>center</b> bowl/center <b>plate</b> interface may reduce turning moments of the truck, wear of truck components, and detrimental dynamic effects such as hunting. Axial-torsional tests determined friction coefficient estimates and wear properties for a matrix of various metallic protective coatings and steel. Tungsten carbide-cobalt-chrome has a favorable coefficient of 0. 3 under standard <b>center</b> bowl/center <b>plate</b> contact conditions...|$|R

50|$|There {{have been}} four belt designs used to {{represent}} the NWA World Heavyweight championship, along with one custom-designed belt, used by Dan Severn.

5000|$|A {{new design}} was {{introduced}} in 1982, nicknamed the [...] "Big Green Belt" [...] due to its size {{and the color of}} its strap. It included eight (later ten) side plates dedicated to the previous champions. The <b>center</b> <b>plate</b> featured a wrestler holding up a championship belt with a globe behind him. This design, held by Bob Backlund, The Iron Sheik, and Hulk Hogan, was replaced first by the [...] "Hogan '84" [...] design in late 1984, then by the nearly identical [...] "Hogan '85" [...] design in early 1985. Both were called [...] "Hogan" [...] belts as they were only worn by Hulk Hogan. Both championship belts were similar in design to the NWA Television Championship at the time. They consisted of silver plates on a black strap, the <b>center</b> <b>plate</b> read [...] "WWF" [...] at the top. Below that was an eagle with two banners below it reading [...] "World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion". The bottom read [...] "Worldwide Wrestling" [...] and above that was a name plate commemorating Hogan's title win, while the side plates noted previous champions. The difference between the '84 and the '85 designs were that the writing (except WWF) was in red on the '84, and black background was added on the '85 belt. The next year, the [...] "Hogan '86" [...] was introduced and was again only worn by Hogan. The <b>center</b> <b>plate</b> featured a globe in the center, along with Roman columns and olive branches. It read [...] "World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion" [...] and included the famous WWF block logo at the top, while four side plates had flags (two flags per side plate) representing the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Soviet Union, and Italy.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} WWWF World Heavyweight Championship belt {{design was}} originally a title belt {{used to represent}} a United States championship that Buddy Rogers had defended sometime prior to becoming the inaugural WWWF world champion. Due to this, the <b>center</b> <b>plate</b> was an outline of the continental United States, {{and there were two}} shield-shaped side plates with grapplers on them. On the <b>center</b> <b>plate,</b> there was a circle flanked by grapplers, and the circle was designed to contain a photograph of the titleholder. Above the circle was a shield with an eagle atop it with stars {{on opposite sides of the}} shield. The caption [...] "World's Champion" [...] was added below the circle. This version of the title belt was worn by the inaugural champion Buddy Rogers in 1963 and the second champion Bruno Sammartino. After Sammartino became champion, a new version on a blue strap was introduced. The enlarged center piece contained a crowned globe and two grapplers, and read [...] "WWWF World Champion"; the two side plates commemorated Sammartino's title win. Sammartino wore this version for the duration of his seven-year reign. After defeating Sammartino in January 1971, Ivan Koloff held this version for three weeks before losing it to Pedro Morales.During Morales's reign, the championship belt was updated several times. First, the 1971 design, on an indigo colored strap, contained three shield-shaped <b>plates.</b> Below the <b>center</b> <b>plate,</b> which read [...] "World Heavyweight Champion" [...] and had a cross at its <b>center,</b> a separate <b>plate</b> read [...] "WWWF". This was replaced with another design in 1972. This version, on a red strap, read [...] "WWWF Heavyweight Wrestling Champion" [...] around the edges with an eagle at the center, while six side plates represented several countries. 1973 saw the introduction of another yet similar design; this one was on a black strap and contained two grapplers above the eagle. This version was subsequently held by Stan Stasiak, Bruno Sammartino, Superstar Billy Graham - who wore a red leather variation - and Bob Backlund. During the latter's reign, the promotion's name was shortened to World Wrestling Federation (WWF), but the physical championship belt still read [...] "WWWF".|$|R
