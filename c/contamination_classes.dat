40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} surgical site infections (SSI) in the urology wards {{as well as the}} SSI incidence in relation to the ASA score and surgical site <b>contamination</b> <b>class.</b> Materials and methods: One-year prospective cohort study was conducted in the Urologic department, General hospital, Sabac. The patients were daily examined and their diagnoses were made according to the definition of hospital infections using concurrently the ASA score and surgical site <b>contamination</b> <b>class.</b> Results: Out of 241 operated patients, 32 patients were diagnosed with 33 SSI. The overall incidence rate of patients with SSI was 5. 9 % while incidence rate of SSI was 6. 1 %. There were not the differences in the incidence rates according to the ASA score of patients (p> 0. 05). The incidence of SSI was 5. 0 % in the clan wounds, 11. 2 % in the clean-contaminated, and 20. 7 % in the contaminated wounds (÷ 2 = 8. 2 DF= 2 p< 0. 016). The patients with SSIs were hospitalized approximately 2 times longer than the patients without SSI (t=- 6, 28; df= 239; p< 0, 001).

This study aimed {{to investigate the}} heavy metal pollutants of Yazd battery repairing workshops and to identify the ecological and environmental effects resulted. Materials and Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study {{was carried out in}} Yazd. In this regard, the city was divided into three parts on the basis of geographical features. Then, 30 workshops were selected from each part through stratified random sampling method. Heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cr, Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn) in the floor were measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The impacts assessment of heavy metals was evaluated using environmental potential risk index (RI), cumulative pollution index (IPI), pollution coefficient factor (Cf), and the degree of modified contamination (mCd) and Pearson’s correlation statistical test. Results: The trend of heavy metals concentrations in floor dust particles of workshops was as Fe>Cu>Pb>Zn>Mn>Cr>Cd. Therefore, the average concentrations of Fe and Cd in the samples were 27011. 52 ± 4721. 05 and 78. 25 ± 21. 07 mg/kg respectively. The results of the RI showed that heavy metal of floor dust had very high danger (2816. 29). The mCd value was as 63. 35 indicating these workshops were at severe <b>contamination</b> <b>class.</b> The value of Cf was as 304. 17 revealing that these workshops were at very severe <b>contamination</b> <b>class.</b> Conclusions: This research showed that the high concentration of heavy metals in battery repairing workshops is due to the interaction of heavy metals of industrial wastes components, including electrical wastes and battery with the dust having mankind origin...|$|R
40|$|Background: Surgical site {{infection}} (SSI) is {{a serious}} complication after orthopedic surgery, and it is associated with high morbidity rates, high healthcare costs {{and in some cases}} poor patients outcomes. Aims: The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the burden of SSI among orthopedic surgery and its associated risk factors of SSI among the people underwent spinal surgery in a selected hospital in China. Methods: From June 26 to November 30 in 2014, we performed a prospective surveillance study in the patients who underwent orthopedic surgery in a selected Chinese hospital. SSI was diagnosed based on the definition established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and was identified by bedside surveillance and post-discharge checkup. Detailed pre-, intra-, post-operative patient characteristics were prospectively recorded using a standardized data collection format. Results: A total of 287 orthopedic surgery cases, among them 192 cases of spinal surgery, were included, of which 8 cases developed surgical site infection. Wound <b>contamination</b> <b>class,</b> wound drains and blood transfusion were surgery-related risk factors for orthopedic spinal surgery during the hospital stay after bivariate analysis. Intravenous AMP was given in 176 of 287 (61. 3 %) after orthopedic surgery. The average duration of AMP administration was 2. 2 days (range 1 - 9 days). Conclusion: In conclusion, we identified an incidence proportion of SSI after orthopedic surgery of 2. 8 %.

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of SSI in the departments of orthopedics and traumatology as well as the SSI incidence in relation to the ASA score, surgical site <b>contamination</b> <b>class</b> and NNIS index. Methods. A prospective cohort study followed daily all the surgical patients hospitalized over 48 hours in the Institute for Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology, Clinical Center of Serbia, as well as 30 days after the discharge, during the period between February 1 to July 31, 2002. The patients were examined and their diagnoses made according to the definition of hospital infections, i. e. upon clinical and/or laboratory analyses, using concurrently the ASA score, surgical site <b>contamination</b> <b>class</b> and NNIS index. Results. Out of 227 surgical patients, 60 were diagnosed with SSI during their hospitalization, while 3 of the patients developed SSI after the discharge. The incidence of SSI was 22. 7 % (95 % CI = 17. 8 − 27. 6). In the patients with good health condition, i. e. ASA ≤ 2, the incidence of SSI was 18. 3 % (43 / 235) and in those with ASA > 2, it was 47. 6 % (20 / 42) (χ 2 = 17. 4; p < 0. 001). The incidence of SSI was 13. 5 % (25 / 185) in the clean wounds, 11. 6 % (5 / 43) in purely contaminated, while it was much higher in the contaminated 65. 5 %; (19 / 29) and soiled 70. 0 %; (14 / 20) wounds (χ 2 = 67. 6; p < 0. 001). The incidence of SSI in relation to NNIS was 8. 1 % (13 / 161) in the patients with score 0, then 36. 4 % (32 / 88) in the patients with score 1, and 64. 3 % (18 / 28) in the patients with the scores 2 and 3 (χ 2 = 57. 3; p < 0. 001).

Objective: To analyze the risk factors of SSI occurrence at CHD-B Methods: Prospective, descriptive and analytical study involving 603 patients undergoing general surgery (218) and obstetrics and gynecology (385) from 1 stJanuary to 31 st July 2013. Results: 44 patients have developed SSI (7. 3 %). The SSI frequency was 12. 8 % in general surgery and 4. 2 % in gynecology-obstetrics (p significant). The mean age of patients developing SSI was 30. 7 ± 15. 8 years with a minimum and maximum 5 months and 70 years, respectively; and for general surgery patients, there were 23 men and 5 women (p not significant).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{aim of this}} cluster-randomized, {{crossover}} {{trial was}} to compare the efficacy of plain soap and water with an alcohol-based handrub for surgical hand preparation and prevention of surgical-site infection (SSI) in a Kenyan rural hospital. METHODS: A total of 3317 patients undergoing clean and clean-contaminated surgery were included. Follow-up data 30 days after discharge were available for 3133 patients (94. 5 per cent). RESULTS: SSI occurred in 255 patients (8. 1 per cent), with similar rates for both study arms: 8. 3 per cent for alcohol-based handrub versus 8. 0 per cent for plain soap and water (odds ratio 1. 03, 95 per cent confidence interval 0. 80 to 1. 33). After adjustment for imbalances between study arms and clustering effects, the main outcome measure remained unchanged (adjusted odds ratio 1. 06, 0. 81 to 1. 38). The duration of surgery and wound <b>contamination</b> <b>class</b> independently predicted SSI. The cost difference between the methods was small (euro 4. 60 per week for alcohol-based handrub compared with euro 3. 30 for soap and water). CONCLUSION: There was no statistically or clinically significant difference in SSI rates, probably because more important factors contribute to SSI development. However, this study demonstrated the feasibility and affordability of alcohol-based handrubs for hand preparation before surgery in settings without continuous, clean water.

40|$|Objective. To {{compare the}} rate of {{surgical}} site infection (SSI) before and after an intervention period in which an optimized policy for antibiotic prophylaxis was implemented. To demonstrate that a more prudent, restrictive policy {{would not have a}} detrimental effect on patient outcomes. Design. Before-after trial with prospective SSI surveillance in the Dutch nosocomial surveillance network (Preventie Ziekenhuisinfecties door Surveillance [PREZIES]), using the criteria of the Centers for Disease Control, including postdischarge surveillance for up to 1 year. Methods. During a preintervention period and a postintervention period (both 6 - 13 months), 12 Dutch hospitals collected data on antimicrobial prophylaxis and SSI rates. The study was limited to commonly performed surgical procedures in 4 specialties: vascular, intestinal, gynecological and orthopedic surgery. Selected risk factors for analysis were sex, age, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, wound <b>contamination</b> <b>class,</b> duration of surgery, length of hospital stay before surgery, and urgency of surgery (elective or acute). Results. A total of 3, 621 procedures were included in the study, of which 1, 668 were performed before the intervention and 1, 953 after. The overall SSI rate decreased from 5. 4 % to 4. 5 % (P=. 22). Among the procedures included in the study, the largest proportion (55 %) were total hip arthroplasty, and the smallest proportion (2 %) were replacement of the head of the femur. SSI rates varied from 0 % for vaginal hysterectomy to 21. 1 % for femoropopliteal or femorotibial bypass surgery. Crude and adjusted odds ratios showed that there were no significant changes in procedure-specific SSI rates after the intervention (P>. 1). Conclusions.

Dredging sometimes occur {{in areas where the}} sediments are contaminated material and is subject to consent and licensing according to the national regulations. This work shows the general pattern of distribution of potentially toxic elements (PTEs), such as As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn, in surface sediments of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon mouth area (Portugal). The work is based on textural, mineralogical and geochemical analysis of 137 surface sediment (first centimetre) samples. The Pollution Load Index (PLI) was used to evaluate the overall enrichment of these elements and the enrichment factor (EF) was determined to assess the degree of anthropogenic input of taking into account the characteristics of the receiving environment and its legitimate use; and one station (29) as slightly contaminated dredged material (Class 3) that may be used for embankments {{or in the case of}} soaking requires a thorough study of the place of deposition and subsequent PTEs. Portuguese Ministerial Order n. ° 1450 / 2007 was used as reference to classify dredging and elimination or application of dredging materials. Results evidence that the study area, which is highly anthropized, the concentration of PTEs is largely controlled by the hydrodynamics. The PLI index values show the highest enrichment of metals in the western side of Mira Channel entrance. The EF values indicate that eighty-three stations have significant enrichment of metals particularly Pb and Cr being the significant enrichment by Cr much more common and by Pb punctually.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the role of}} the surgeon in the occurrence of surgical site infection (SSI) following colon surgery, with respect to his or her adherence to guidelines and his or her experience. Design, Setting, and Patients: Prospective cohort study of 2393 patients who underwent colon surgery performed by 31 surgeons in 9 secondary and tertiary care public Swiss hospitals, recruited from a surveillance program for SSI between March 1, 1998, and December 31, 2008, and followed up for 1 month after their operation. Main Outcome Measures: Risk factors for SSI were identified in univariate and multivariate analyses that included the patients' and procedures' characteristics, the hospitals, and the surgeons as candidate covariates. Correlations were sought between surgeons' individual adjusted risks, their self-reported adherence to guidelines, and the delay since their board certification. Results: A total of 428 SSIs (17. 9 %) were identified, with hospital rates varying from 4. 0 % to 25. 2 % and individual surgeon rates varying from 3. 7 % to 36. 1 %. Features of the patients and procedures associated with SSI in univariate analyses were male sex, age, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, <b>contamination</b> <b>class,</b> operation duration, and emergency procedure. Correctly timed antibiotic prophylaxis and laparoscopic approach were protective. Multivariate analyses adjusting for these features and for the hospitals found 4 surgeons with higher risk of SSI (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 37, 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 51 - 3. 70; OR = 2. 19, 95 % CI, 1. 41 - 3. 39; OR = 2. 15, 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 4. 53; and OR = 1. 97, 95 % CI, 1. 18 - 3. 30) and 2 surgeons with lower risk of SSI (OR = 0. 43, 95 % CI, 0. 19 - 0. 94; and OR = 0. 19, 95 % CI, 0. 04 - 0. 81).

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine quantitatively and qualitatively the predominant types of microbial contamination occurring in conventional and laminar flow clean rooms. One horizontal laminar flow, three conventional industrial clean rooms, and three open factory areas were selected for microbiological tests. The results showed that as the environment and personnel of a clean room were controlled in a more positive manner with respect to the reduction of particulate contamination, the levels of airborne and surface microbial contaminants were reduced accordingly. The chief sources of microbial contamination were associated with the density and activity of clean room personnel. In addition, the majority of microorganisms isolated from the intramural air by air samplers were those indigenous to humans. Studies on the fallout and accumulation of airborne microorganisms on stainless-steel surfaces showed that, although there were no significant differences in the levels of microbial contamination among the conventional clean rooms, the type of microorganism detected on stainless-steel surfaces was consistently and significantly different. In addition, the “plateau phenomenon” occurred in all environments studied.

To this aim, 336 samples of bivalve molluscs (185 mussels, 66 clams, 23 oysters and 62 samples from other species) collected in harvesting areas of class A and B of four Italian Regions were analyzed for qualitative and quantitative determination of hepatitis A virus (HAV) and Norovirus (NoV) GI and GII, using real time RT-PCR. The results showed a wide diffusion of viral contamination in the shellfish production areas considered. HAV prevalence was low (0. 9 %) with contamination levels that varied from 5 to 7 × 10 (2) copies/g. On the contrary, NoV showed a high prevalence (51. 5 %), with a large variability according to the group considered (e. g. 47. 8 % for Crassostrea in Veneto, 79. 7 % for Mytilus in Campania, 84. 6 % for Tapes in Sardinia). NoV <b>contamination</b> affected <b>class</b> A and class B production areas to a different extent, with {{a statistically significant difference}} in both contamination prevalence (22. 1 % vs. 66. 3 %; p< 0. 0001) and quantity (average contamination level of 3. 1 × 10 (2) vs. 1. 9 × 10 (3) copies/g; p< 0. 05). The different species analyzed from class B harvesting areas (Mytilus, Tapes/Ruditapes and Crassostrea) showed a NoV prevalence respectively of 70. 3 %, 66. 0 % and 47. 8 % but comparable NoV contamination levels (between 8. 4 × 10 (2) and 4. 9 × 10 (3) copies/g).

Level of Ni in river sediment is 22.7  mg/kg and TRV is 16  mg/kg (USEPA 1999, Table  5). However, the concentration of Ni was found either close or slightly above the permissible limit at most of the sites. Contamination factor was followed the class 1. It was highest at Ayodhya and followed by Colonelganj, Chhapra, Dohrighat, and Katerniaghat. This indicates the low level of the contamination of the river sediment. Igeo value follows the class zero. It indicates that river sediment of these sites is very close to the background value which may increase in future due to increasing anthropogenic addition. In similar studies for the sediment of the river Ganga {{it was found that the}} value of Ni was 42  mg/kg at Ghazipur, 59  mg/kg at Buxar, and 52  mg/kg at Ballia (Singh et al. 2013 a). Ni concentration in sediments of the river Ghaghara is compared with other rivers of the World and is presented in Table  5. Ni concentration was 27.7  mg/kg for the river Cauvery (Raju et al. 2012), 67.1  mg/kg for the river Euphrates (Salah et al. 2012), 41.9  mg/kg for the river Yangtze (Wang et al. 2011), and 68  mg/kg was the World average (Turekian and Wedepohl 1961). Nickel can be accumulated in aquatic biota, but its magnification in the food chain is not confirmed. CF factor indicates that the Ni <b>contamination</b> follows the <b>class</b> 1 with low contamination level. It is maximum at Ayodhya. Ni in the aquatic body forms complexes with varying soluble organic and inorganic materials. It adsorbs directly on clay particles and has the capability to co-precipitate with hydroxides of iron and manganese. It is soluble at higher pH values and gets precipitated at pH 10. It is bio-accumulated through aquatic organisms such as phytoplanktons, seaweeds, and algae.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Contamination of {{recreational}} and shellfish waters with fecal pollution {{is a major}} water quality issue with associated economic impacts and human health risks. Reliable fecal source identification and rapid, quantitative analyses are essential components of risk assessment. Enteric bacteria that are endemic to specific hosts have a potential role as public health indicators of fecal pollution. Building on previous work to discriminate ruminant and human fecal <b>contamination,</b> we cloned <b>class</b> Bacteroidetes 16 S rRNA genes from pig, elk, dog, cat, and seagull fecal DNAs. Unique restriction patterns were identified among clones {{from each of the}} host species using Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (T-RFLP). Clones exhibiting unique patterns were sequenced and analyzed phylogenetically, along with human, horse, and cattle sequences recovered from previous work. The analysis revealed both endemic and cosmopolitan (global) host distributions. The sequence data were used to identify host-specific genetic markers for pig and horse feces, and to design PCR primers that identify these sources of fecal pollution in water. There was a high degree of sequence overlap among the fecal Bacteroidetes of wild and domestic ruminants, and among human, domestic pet, and seagull Bacteroidetes. We compared fecal Bacteroidetes rRNA genes from these hosts using subtractive hybridization, a method that identifies differences between closely related genomes or gene sequences. A Bacteroidetes rDNA marker that distinguishes elk and cow feces was identified, as well as a host-specific marker for dog fecal Bacteroidetes. The four newly designed PCR primers were tested for specificity and sensitivity, and the dog primer was successfully used, along with the human and ruminant-specific primers, in a collaborative study comparing fecal source tracking methods. We also developed a real time Taq nuclease assay for quantification of fecal Bacteroidetes 16 S rDNA, and compared it with an EPA-approved enumeration method for the current standard public health indicator, Escherichia coli, in serial dilutions of sewage primary influent. There was a strong, positive correlation between the methods, and the Taq nuclease assay was sensitive and much more rapid than the E. coli assay. PCR source identification and enumeration of fecal Bacteroidetes 16 S rDNA show promise for application in a health risk-based analysis of fecal pollution...|$|R
