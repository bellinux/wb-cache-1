50|$|The game {{follows the}} player's Avatar (or Mii, in the Wii U version), {{who is a}} giant {{in the world of}} the Keflings. As in the {{previous}} game, the Keflings are a minute people, similar to gnomes or elves, who need the player's assistance to build-up their kingdoms. The player helps them by harvesting resources and constructing buildings, tasks that can be delegated to the Keflings as well. Throughout the game, the player completes missions and visits three separate kingdoms; the Ice Kingdom, the Forest Kingdom, and the Desert Kingdom. Each kingdom features its own unique <b>climate,</b> <b>resources,</b> and characters. The player can gain access to additional content if they also own ilomilo or Raskulls.|$|E
5000|$|Area is {{the primary}} {{determinant}} {{of the number of}} species in a fragment [...] and the relative contributions of demographic and genetic processes to the risk of global population extinction depend on habitat configuration, stochastic environmental variation and species features. Minor fluctuations in <b>climate,</b> <b>resources,</b> or other factors that would be unremarkable and quickly corrected in large populations can be catastrophic in small, isolated populations. Thus fragmentation of habitat is an important cause of species extinction. Population dynamics of subdivided populations tend to vary ly. In an unfragmented landscape a declining population can be [...] "rescued" [...] by immigration from a nearby expanding population. In fragmented landscapes, the distance between fragments may prevent this from happening. Additionally, unoccupied fragments of habitat that are separated from a source of immigrants by some barrier {{are less likely to be}} repopulated than adjoining fragments. Even small species such as the Columbia spotted frog are reliant on the rescue effect. Studies showed 25% of juveniles travel a distance over 200m compared to 4% of adults. Of these, 95% remain in their new locale, demonstrating that this journey is necessary for survival.|$|E

5000|$|A {{large portion}} {{of the rest of the}} Nakaz looks at law, more specifically, parts of the law such as crime, punishment, and trial. In this section Catherine also talks about equal {{treatment}} under the law, the nature of law, and what liberty means in an autocratic state. Though she does not explore the issue of serfdom very deeply, many of her more in-depth thoughts were expressed in previous drafts of her Instruction that were edited out. Catherine first states that law should have sanction and should provide equal protection to all. The discussion of equal protection to all brought to the table the issue of serfdom. Consideration was given to outright condemnation of the practice of serfdom, but Catherine was advised against such radical proposals; consequently in the final document, the discussion of the subject is limited to her criticism and condemnation of physical abuse. The Instruction explores the nature of law, or more specifically, how laws of different cultures come about. Catherine cites the cultures of “savage nations”, China, Japan, Lacedaemonians (Spartans), Rome, and Spain as examples of how elements such as <b>climate,</b> <b>resources,</b> and general manner of the people affect the development of their individual cultures. The discussion of culture and law is followed by views on punishment and how crime should be measured and how punishment should relate to crime. Catherine states that there are four types of offenses: crimes against religion, crimes against morals, crimes that disturb the peace, and crimes that affect the security of the citizens. Here Catherine takes her stance on torture and condemns the practice as a punishment. [...] Due to other arguments made on the issue of crime and punishment, it came to be widely believed that Catherine was of the school of thought that suggested it is better to let ten guilty men go free than to convict a single innocent man. [...] In fact, there is no such passage in the Instruction. Her writings about how the judicial system should be viewed were radical at the time. She believed in the importance of a judge, jury, and witnesses, but claimed that the way police were viewed in society was wrong. Police, in her opinion, were meant to uncover crime, not exact justice, and this issue was looked at more closely in supplements she added to the text later. She went so far as to say that being arrested “ought not to be looked upon as a punishment, but rather as the means of preserving the person of the accused in safety, which assure him at the same time of his liberty, provided he is innocent.” ...|$|E

40|$|The “nationalization” of <b>climate</b> <b>resources</b> (wind {{and solar}} energy) by the Heilongjiang provincial {{government}} sparked a public furor over the attempted government seizure over the public property {{of wind and}} sunlight. This Article argues that the opposition reflects a misconception of public property. Both under Chinese law and from a normative perspective, public property should only means property and resources that are owned by the state. Public free access is merely a form of allocation that should be changed upon alterations in use pattern arising from technological advancement and social-economic changes.

40|$|Climate is an {{important}} resource for many types of tourism. One of several metrics for the suitability of climate for sightseeing is Mieczkowski’s “Tourism Climatic Index” (TCI), which summarizes and combines seven climate variables. By means of the TCI, we analyse the present <b>climate</b> <b>resources</b> for tourism in Europe and projected changes under future climate change. We use daily data from five regional climate models and compare the reference period 1961 – 1990 to the A 2 scenario in 2071 – 2100. A comparison of the TCI based on reanalysis data and model simulations for the reference period shows that current regional climate models capture the important climatic patterns. Currently, <b>climate</b> <b>resources</b> are best in Southern Europe and deteriorate with increasing latitude and altitude. With climate change the latitudinal band of favourable climate is projected to shift northward improving <b>climate</b> <b>resources</b> in Northern and Central Europe in most seasons. Southern Europe’s suitability for sightseeing tourism drops strikingly in the summer holiday months but is partially compensated by considerable improvements between October and Apri...|$|E

One hundred and five plots in seven different pasture plant communities were sampled: (1) nitrophilous, (2) montane mesic, (3) subalpine mesic, (4) calcareous montane, (5) calcareous subalpine, (6) acid montane, and (7) acid subalpine pastures. Forward selection and variation partitioning {{were applied to}} identify {{the most important factors}} controlling the species composition and plant traits in the pastures. Aggregated weighted averages were calculated for each plot using the published values of average height, specific leaf area, and seed mass for each species. Explanatory variables were recorded for each site to reflect climate, soil properties, and grazing pressure. We hypothesised that species composition and functional variation in pastures of the Southern Alps are controlled by three main environmental filters: <b>climate,</b> <b>resource</b> availability, and grazing pressure. We found that variables of climate and soil properties had a major role in explaining the species composition and variations in plant traits, while grazing pressure showed a lower independent effect. Species composition and plant traits depended mainly on temperature, soil fertility, and variables of bedrock type — soil pH. Our results confirm the importance of taking the effects of <b>climate</b> and <b>resource</b> availability into account when describing plant and community functions of grasslands...|$|R
