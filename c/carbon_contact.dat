40|$|A binding {{hot spot}} {{is a small}} area at a protein-protein {{interface}} that can make significant contribution to binding free energy. This work investigates the substantial contribution made by some special co-occurring atomic contacts at a binding hot spot. A co-occurring atomic contact {{is a pair of}} atomic contacts that are close to each other with no more than three covalent-bond steps. We found that two kinds of co-occurring atomic contacts can play an important part in the accurate prediction of binding hot spot residues. One is the co-occurrence of two nearby hydrogen bonds. For example, mutations of any residue in a hydrogen bond network consisting of multiple co-occurring hydrogen bonds could disrupt the interaction considerably. The other kind of co-occurring atomic contact is the co-occurrence of a hydrophobic <b>carbon</b> <b>contact</b> and a contact between a hydrophobic carbon atom and a π ring. In fact, this co-occurrence signifies the collective effect of hydrophobic contacts. We also found that the B-factor measurements of several specific groups of amino acids are useful for the prediction of hot spots. Taking the B-factor, individual atomic contacts and the co-occurring contacts as features, we developed a new prediction method and thoroughly assessed its performance via cross-validation and independent dataset test. The results show that our method achieves higher prediction performance than well-known methods such as Robetta, FoldX and Hotpoint. We conclude that these contact descriptors, in particular the novel co-occurring atomic contacts, can be used to facilitate accurate and interpretable characterization of protein binding hot spots...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} facing the gold industry in the 21 st century is the continuing need to identify new reserves of economically treatable ores. Discoveries of large, metallurgically simple orebodies are becoming increasingly rarer, forcing companies to investigate options for the processing of ores which may present recovery, economic and/or environmental issues, requiring innovative approaches to their treatment. Ores which contain naturally occurring carbonaceous material (‘preg-robbing ores’) are {{an example of one}} such ore type. Newmont’s Jundee operation contains zones of carbonaceous ore within the oxidised orebody. A program consisting of detailed laboratory work and extensive plant trials has been undertaken to assess the options of the processing of this material. Laboratory tests demonstrated the advantage of carbon-in-leach (CIL) over direct cyanide leaching and carbon-in-pulp (CIP) for treatment of these ores. The laboratory program identified several factors which would enhance overall gold recoveries where preg-robbing ore was being processed, including: keeping preg-robbing ore separate from non-graphitic ore; maximising gravity recovery; and ensuring the plant operates in ‘pure’ CIL mode, ie no leaching prior to first adsorption tank. Several plant trials were undertaken to assess the economic sustainability of treating moderate preg-robbing ores through a modified gravity/leach/adsorption circuit. Results indicated that where good operational control of the circuit was maintained to ensure high gravity recovery, minimal leaching prior to <b>carbon</b> <b>contact,</b> and maintenance of good, active carbon inventory, then acceptable and sustainable overall gold recoveries could be obtained. Using these relatively simple plant modifications potentially allows a plant to treat ores with preg-robbing index (PRI) values up to one. When PRI values rise to 1. 3 - 1. 6, leach recoveries can drop from > 85 per cent to < 40 per cent, indicating a more intensive approach may be required, including kerosene addition and higher carbon inventories and activities...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the mechanism by which activated carbon removes trichloramine, a byproduct of water treatment that has a strongly offensive chlorinous odor. A stoichiometrical mass balance for 15 N before and after activated carbon treatment of laboratory-prepared N- 15 -labeled trichloramine solutions clearly revealed that the mechanism of trichloramine removal with activated carbon was not adsorption but rather reductive decomposition to nitrogen gas. There was a weak positive correlation between the surface decomposition rate constant of trichloramine and the concentration of basic functional groups {{on the surface of}} the carbon particles, the suggestion being that the trichloramine may have been reduced by sulfhydryl groups (SH) on the activated carbon surface. Efficient decomposition of trichloramine was achieved with super powdered activated carbon (SPAC), which was prepared by pulverization of commercially available PAC into very fine particles less than 1 mu m in diameter. SPAC could decompose trichloramine selectively, even when trichloramine and free chlorine were present simultaneously in water, the indication being that the strong disinfection capability of residual free chlorine could be retained even after trichloramine was effectively decomposed. The residual ratio of trichloramine after <b>carbon</b> <b>contact</b> increased somewhat at low water temperatures of 1 - 5 degrees C. At these low temperatures, biological treatment, the traditional method for control of a major trichloramine precursor (ammonium nitrogen), is inefficient. Even at these low temperatures, SPAC could reduce the trichloramine concentration to an acceptable level. A theoretical analysis with a diffusion-reaction model developed in the present study revealed that the increase in the trichloramine residual with decreasing water temperature was attributable to the temperature dependence of the rate of the reductive reaction rather than to the temperature dependence of the diffusive mass transfer rate...|$|E
30|$|Low-cost nano-carbon can be {{an ideal}} {{material}} to substitute Au as a back contact in PSCs because its function {{is similar to that}} of Au. In the past decade, carbon nanomaterials have been demonstrated to be excellent counter-electrode candidates for use in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) owing to their various fascinating properties, including high electrical conductivity, thermal stability, good optical transparency, unique nanostructure, excellent electrocatalytic activity, low cost, and abundance [13, 14, 15, 16]. Substantial gains have been made in the application of carbon nanomaterials in DSSCs; however, perovskite organic lead iodide is unstable at high temperatures or in some solvents [17]. Thus, the direct preparation of a carbon layer faces some problems. HTM-free PSCs with carbon contacts were first fabricated by infiltrating CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 or a mixed-cation 5 -ammoniumvaleric (5 -AVA) and MA perovskite (5 -AVA) x (MA) 1 −x PbI 3 into a high-temperature prefabricated monolithic device, which consists of four layers including TiO 2 dense, TiO 2 mesoporous, ZrO 2 mesoporous, and carbon layers [18]. The (5 -AVA) x (MA) 1 −x PbI 3 perovskite device achieved a PCE of 12.8  %. The cells have shown promising stability under long-term light soaking and long-term heat exposure. But these devices employed complex structures and required processing temperatures of up to 400  °C to remove solvents and organic binders in the printed ZrO 2 space and carbon black/graphite electrodes. The complicated fabrication and high-temperature processing increased material or energy consumption and limited their mass production and fabrication on a plastic substrate. Very recently, carbon counter electrodes were prepared using low-temperature (LT) processed (70 – 100  °C) carbon pastes and applied in HTM-free perovskite/TiO 2 heterojunction solar cells to substitute noble metallic anodes. Under optimized conditions, a PCE in the range of 8.31 – 9.00  % has been demonstrated with these carbon counter electrodes [19, 20]. The HTM-free solar cell with the LT carbon counter electrode can have a much simpler structure, thereby reducing the cost and improving the overall stability of PSCs. However, the PSCs based on the LT <b>carbon</b> <b>contact</b> are poor in photovoltaic performance. Therefore, it is worth developing and improving the performance of HTM-free and carbon-based PSCs.|$|E
