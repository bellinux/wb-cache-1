However, this left the question of how the stresses are distributed throughout a Prince Rupert's drop. In a further study published in 2017 The team collaborated with Dr. Hillar Aben, a professor at Tallinn University of Technology in Estonia using a transmission polariscope to measure the optical retardation of light from a red LED as it travelled through the glass drop, and used the data to construct the stress distribution throughout the drop. This showed that the heads of the drops have a much higher surface compressive stress than previously thought at up to , but that this surface <b>compressive</b> <b>layer</b> is also thin, only about 10% of the diameter of the head of a drop. This gives the surface a high fracture strength which means {{that it is necessary to}} create a crack that enters the interior tension zone in order to break the droplet. As cracks on the surface tend to grow parallel to the surface, they cannot enter the tension zone but a disturbance in the tail allows cracks to enter the tension zone.|$|E

The finite fracture mechanics (FFM) theory and the coupled stress-energy criterion (CC) are discussed and applied to understand their fracture behavior.

Another case study concerns the onset of a crack in a notched sample of a layered ceramic submitted to bending. The propagation of the crack through the ceramic laminate is studied as a function of the volume ratio of particular material components and corresponding magnitude of residual stresses in both compressive and tensile layers.

Relatively thin glasses require high compressive stress for producing fragments, and the required compressive stress is increased with decreasing glass thickness (3. 2 to 2. 1 mm). By analyzing the residual stress of glasses before and after the fragmentation test, we observe that a relatively thin glass spends more stored energy to generate a new fracture surface and stores less energy for the second cracking as compared to thick glasses.

40|$|International audienceOne novel {{approach}} {{to improve the}} apparent toughness of ceramics is to design a multilayer architecture with embedded layers having compressive residual stresses. Surface cracks propagating during mechanical loading can be deflected within the compressive layers, in order to delay the final fracture of the whole structure. The design of high toughness laminates requires understanding the effect of residual stresses on the initiation and propagation of cracks in the material. In this work, a coupled stress-energy criterion is used to predict the initiation and propagation of surface cracks in ceramic laminates upon thermo-mechanical loading. Experiments were conducted on V-notched alumina-based laminates to show the effect of residual stresses and mechanical loading on their fracture behavior. The conditions for crack initiation as predicted for notched specimens agreed with the experimental observations. It is shown that the onset of cracks from V-notches is associated with (i) the tensile residual stresses in the first surface layer and (ii) {{the depth of the}} notch. The further propagation of the crack into the first embedded <b>compressive</b> <b>layer</b> was also studied.

40|$|AbstractThe {{main goal}} of ceramic {{laminates}} designed with residual stresses {{is to increase}} the fracture energy of the system during fracture through energy dissipating mechanisms such as crack deflection or crack bifurcation. The angle of crack deflection from the straight propagation direction is influenced mainly by level of the residual stresses in the laminate layers, which was investigated in previous works of the authors. Another key factor playing role in the crack deflection and presence of the crack bifurcation phenomenon is the thickness of the layer to which the crack propagates. This factor has not been studied yet and will be thus essence of this contribution where the combined effect of compressive residual stresses and layer thickness is numerically investigated. Three different multilayer designs of Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 based ceramic materials are modelled using a non-periodic and symmetric architecture (i. e. layers of a given material may not have the same thickness within one specimen, but they are symmetrically distributed with respect to the laminate mid-plane). The volume ratio of both material constituents is kept constant, so that the residual stresses in the different laminates remain unchanged. Varied is only the thickness of the second <b>compressive</b> <b>layer</b> (where the bifurcation phenomenon is observed). A crack terminating perpendicularly on the first interface with the <b>compressive</b> <b>layer</b> is considered as the initial state before application of the four point bending. Using the fracture criterion, based on the Finite Fracture Mechanics, the angle and type of crack propagation (single crack deflection/bifurcation) is investigated.

For gamma(j) < 3 / 2, rarefactive double layers occur, but, just below 3 / 2, at unrealistically small cool electron densities or large Mach numbers.

40|$|The article {{present the}} results of the study on the {{improvement}} of mechanical properties of the surface layer of 7075 aluminum alloy via two-stage aging combined with shot peening. The experiments proved that thermo-mechanical treatment may significantly improve hardness and stress distribution in the surface <b>layer.</b> <b>Compressive</b> stresses of 226 MPa± 5. 5 MPa and hardness of 210 ± 2 HV were obtained for selected samples...|$|R
50|$|Unlike LPB, {{traditional}} burnishing tools {{consist of}} a hard wheel or fixed lubricated ball pressed into the surface of an asymmetrical work piece with sufficient force to deform the surface layers, usually in a lathe. The process does multiple passes over the work pieces, usually under increasing load, to improve surface finish and deliberately cold work the surface. Roller and ball burnishing have been studied in Russia and Japan, and were applied most extensively in the USSR in the 1970s. Various burnishing methods are used, particularly in Eastern Europe, to improve fatigue life. Improvements in HCF, corrosion fatigue and SCC are documented, with fatigue strength enhancement attributed to improved finish, {{the development of a}} <b>compressive</b> surface <b>layer,</b> and the increased yield strength of the cold worked surface.|$|R
