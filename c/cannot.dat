5|$|The {{hydrated}} form {{of aluminium}} chloride has an octahedral molecular geometry, {{with the central}} aluminum ion surrounded by six water ligand molecules. This means that the hydrated form <b>cannot</b> act as a Lewis acid since it <b>cannot</b> accept electron pairs, and thus this <b>cannot</b> {{be used as a}} catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aromatic compounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{judicial}} {{branch of}} the United States government <b>cannot</b> enforce the Convention, thus invalidating Hamdan's argument that he <b>cannot</b> be tried until after his prisoner-of-war status is determined.|$|E
5|$|A cat <b>cannot</b> be made deputy {{without having}} mentored {{at least one}} apprentice.|$|E
5|$|A {{new version}} of Dogmeat appears in Fallout 4. Fallout 4′s Dogmeat is a German Shepherd, and <b>cannot</b> die.|$|E
5|$|A {{person whose}} pain <b>cannot</b> be well {{controlled}} should {{be referred to}} a palliative care or pain management specialist or clinic.|$|E
5|$|Although fat is {{a common}} way of storing energy, in {{vertebrates}} such as humans the fatty acids in these stores <b>cannot</b> be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis as these organisms <b>cannot</b> convert acetyl-CoA into pyruvate; plants do, but animals do not, have the necessary enzymatic machinery. As a result, after long-term starvation, vertebrates need to produce ketone bodies from fatty acids to replace glucose in tissues such as the brain that <b>cannot</b> metabolize fatty acids. In other organisms such as plants and bacteria, this metabolic problem is solved using the glyoxylate cycle, which bypasses the decarboxylation step in the citric acid cycle and allows the transformation of acetyl-CoA to oxaloacetate, {{where it can be}} used for the production of glucose.|$|E
5|$|As cases <b>cannot</b> be {{stacked in}} Wagiman, these number suffixes <b>cannot</b> be called case suffixes, whereas the nominal suffixes {{discussed}} above (such as -binyju 'only'), {{show the same}} syntactic distribution - they occur {{in the same place}} - and therefore may be analysed as cases themselves.|$|E
5|$|As of November 25, 2010, Divine Heresy <b>cannot</b> {{be found}} on the Century Media Records website.|$|E
5|$|As the MacBook Pro uses a {{different}} hardware platform from earlier PowerPC (PPC)-based Macintoshes, versions of OS X prior to Lion can run PPC applications only via the Rosetta emulator, which exacts some performance penalty, <b>cannot</b> emulate some lower-level PPC code, {{and does not}} support 64-bit (G5 specific) PPC features. Rosetta is not present in Lion and later, so PPC applications <b>cannot</b> be run under those versions of OS X.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} {{restaurants}} at Terminal 5, Plane Food <b>cannot</b> use gas equipment due to safety reasons and so electric ovens and hobs are used instead {{as well as}} a single microwave. The cutlery is also a standard airport size so that the knives <b>cannot</b> be used as weapons. Ramsay requires that staff who are working at Plane Food must gain work experience in another one of his restaurants first.|$|E
5|$|But we <b>cannot</b> imagine {{something}} that is greater than God.|$|E

5|$|Coverbs however, <b>cannot</b> inflect for {{person and}} <b>cannot,</b> in themselves, head finite clauses. If {{they are to}} act {{as the head of}} a clause, they must combine with a verb, thereby forming a bipartite verbal compound, {{commonly}} called a complex predicate.|$|E
5|$|Cryptologist Tomi Melka deduced that Fischer's {{hypothesis}} <b>cannot</b> {{be true for}} {{the entire}} Staff, let alone other texts.|$|E
5|$|Drives which encrypt all {{writes on}} the fly can {{implement}} ATA Secure Erase in another way. They simply zeroize and generate a new random encryption key each time a secure erase is done. In this way the old data <b>cannot</b> be read anymore, as it <b>cannot</b> be decrypted. Some drives with an integrated encryption may require a TRIM command {{be sent to the}} drive to put the drive back to its original out-of-box state.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{any move}} of the knight and castling, pieces <b>cannot</b> jump over other pieces. A piece is {{captured}} (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces {{it on its}} square (en passant is the only exception). The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game. The king can be put in check but <b>cannot</b> be captured (see below).|$|E

5|$|HAT-P-33 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 11.89. It <b>cannot</b> {{be seen from}} Earth {{with the naked eye}} because it is so dim.|$|E
5|$|Hastert <b>cannot</b> {{be prosecuted}} for sexual abuse because the statute of {{limitations}} has expired for his conduct decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|Hume criticised {{the view}} that we <b>cannot</b> speak about God, and {{proposed}} that this view {{is no different from}} the skeptical view that God <b>cannot</b> be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be completely different from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|I {{am afraid}} my {{men will be}} very angry when they see it. I <b>cannot</b> {{understand}} why the old man <b>cannot</b> do justice to those to whom he owed so much {{and the whole thing}} is so absolutely inconsistent with what he had already cabled.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} {{anything}} that humanity <b>cannot</b> produce, the being who produces it is better than humanity. But humanity <b>cannot</b> produce {{the things that are}} in the universe – the heavenly bodies, etc. The being, therefore, who produces them is superior to humanity. But who is there that is superior to humanity, except God? Therefore, God exists.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the giant or waterfall swiftlet, Hydrochous gigas, which <b>cannot</b> echolocate, may be descended from an echolocating ancestor.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-11 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 14.2, and thus <b>cannot</b> {{be seen with}} the naked eye.|$|E
5|$|Like Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Ruby and Sapphire {{keep track}} of real-life time; this {{influences}} events like tides and berry plant growth. However, unlike their predecessors, Ruby and Sapphire do not differentiate between day and night. Also, due to {{the differences in the}} technical specifications of Game Boy link cables and Game Boy Advance link cables, Ruby and Sapphire <b>cannot</b> be linked with Pokémon games of previous generations; one <b>cannot</b> battle with or trade to the previous generations.|$|E

5|$|Others {{who are not}} {{obliged to}} lay tefillin include a mourner during {{the first day of}} his {{mourning}} period, and a bridegroom on his wedding-day. A sufferer from stomach-trouble or one who is otherwise in pain and <b>cannot</b> concentrate his mind is also exempt. One who is engaged {{in the study of the}} Law and scribes of and dealers in tefillin and mezuzot while engaged in their work if it <b>cannot</b> be postponed, are also free from this obligation.|$|E

5|$|Participants in est {{are told}} that they <b>cannot</b> take notes during the course, {{and at the end}} of the seminar the {{instructor}} declines to go over a review of the training. In order to participate in the course, trainees must adhere to agreements which include: they may not exit the course facility except during specified break time, they <b>cannot</b> sit next to someone they knew before coming to the course, and they <b>cannot</b> take unprescribed medications or alcohol for the week prior to the training.|$|E
5|$|Services are intangible; {{they have}} no {{physical}} form and they <b>cannot</b> be seen before purchase or taken home.|$|E
5|$|Song has no rhythm guitar or bass guitar track {{included}} and, thus, <b>cannot</b> {{be played}} in any co-operative mode.|$|E
5|$|Spaying or neutering {{increases}} life expectancy: {{one study}} found neutered male cats live {{twice as long as}} intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females. Having a cat neutered confers health benefits, because castrated males <b>cannot</b> develop testicular cancer, spayed females <b>cannot</b> develop uterine or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancer.|$|E
