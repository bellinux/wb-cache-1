40|$|This {{paper is}} about a {{complete}} photogrammetric record of St. Domingo de Silos' Church (XIV century), in Alcala la Real (Jaen, Spain). It was declared National Monument in 1931. At present it is a ruin heavily damaged and near to collapse. So, local authorities have decided urgent actions for the reconstruction. Previous to the restoration works, different surveying and photogrammetric techniques were used for a reconstruction project and cataloguing of an important historical building, but at moderate costs with the extensive use of non metric and semi-metric instrumentation. A wide variety of photogrammetric methods and instruments has been applied: analytical and digital plotters; terrestrial metric, semi-metric (reseau plate) and non metric cameras (analogical and digital). Stereoscopic pairs, when possible, were taken {{with the help of}} a device which allowed for stereoscopic shots. <b>Convergent</b> <b>photographs</b> were also taken in order to reach a favourable geometry for bundle adjustment (selfcalibration) and control point densification. Both photogrammetric and desktop scanners were used. To maintain low costs, the main final products, in case of planar surfaces, were mosaics of rectified photographs. Cross sections, modelling and structural analysis of deformation of walls and a vault were also made in order to support the final architectural restoration project...|$|E
40|$|This letter {{has tested}} the canopy height profile (CHP) {{methodology}} {{as a way}} of effective leaf area index (LAIe) and vertical vegetation profile retrieval at a single-tree level. Waveform and discrete airborne LiDAR data from six swaths, {{as well as from the}} combined data of six swaths, were used to extract the LAIe of a single live Callitris glaucophylla tree. LAIe was extracted from raw waveform as an intermediate step in the CHP methodology, with two different vegetation-ground reflectance ratios. Discrete point LAIe estimates were derived from the gap probability using the following: 1) single ground returns and 2) all ground returns. LiDAR LAIe retrievals were subsequently compared to hemispherical photography estimates, yielding mean values within ± 7 % of the latter, depending on the method used. The CHP of a single dead Callitris glaucophylla tree, representing the distribution of vegetation material, was verified with a field profile manually reconstructed from <b>convergent</b> <b>photographs</b> taken with a fixed-focal-length camera. A binwise comparison of the two profiles showed very high correlation between the data reaching R 2 of 0. 86 for the CHP from combined swaths. Using a study-area-adjusted reflectance ratio improved the correlation between the profiles, but only marginally in comparison to using an arbitrary ratio of 0. 5 for the laser wavelength of 1550 nm...|$|E
40|$|A {{specialised}} {{digital system}} of close range photogrammetry {{has been developed}} in the Department of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Informatics of University of Mining and Metallurgy in Cracow, Poland. The system has been implemented in two applications. The first one is related to medicine and used for overload monitoring {{for the purpose of}} medical rehabilitation, and the second one is designated for railways, to locate points on cross-sections. Calibrated images are required as input data for the system. The calibration can be performed in a laboratory, using a test field, by means of cameras with constant interior orientation parameters. For medical purposes, several points are marked on the patient's body in selected locations. <b>Convergent</b> <b>photographs</b> composed of direct photos and images reflected from a mirror located behind the patient are used to record points at the patient's front and back. The mirror allows to reduce to the minimum the numbers of stands for image recording. In this case, free-focus cameras, such as Kodak DC 200, were used. The system of reference is defined by reference points located on the mirror surface. Results of measurements are shown in a graphic form. The second application concerns locating points on railways cross-sections. Digital cameras with nearly parallel axes are placed on a special railway platform. The co-ordinates of reference points marked on the stiff frame structure are determined in relation to the rail head level and track axis. These cameras have a high-precision shutter synchronisation. ...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the survey}} is {{performed}} for repair, {{such as a}} bridge and a building built in past, spending great expense. And it is anxious for the survey technique that doesn’t need cost and time more. Then, we made {{an idea of the}} technique of precise 3 D model creation by 2 D pictures. However, the technique of performing the improvement in accuracy of <b>convergent</b> <b>photographing</b> and automatic acquisition of corresponding points was not established. Therefore, in this research, we try to obtain a semi-automation of corresponding points acquisition from initial corresponding points and the improvement in accuracy of <b>convergent</b> <b>photographing.</b> Moreover, we applied the research to the used house of Japanese real estate, and the applicable field was selected as the high needs of the residence of 3 D model. And we developed the system that everyone could create Web / 3 D model house by VRML easily without requiring expensive apparatuses or expertise...|$|R
