25|$|Clays exhibit {{plasticity}} when {{mixed with}} water in certain proportions. However, when dry, clay becomes firm and when fired in a kiln, permanent {{physical and chemical}} changes occur. These changes convert the clay into a ceramic material. Because of these properties, clay is used for making pottery, both utilitarian and decorative, and <b>construction</b> <b>products,</b> such as bricks, wall and floor tiles. Different types of clay, when used with different minerals and firing conditions, are used to produce earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain.
