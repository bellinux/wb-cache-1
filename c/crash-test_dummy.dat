The chair exploded on the launch pad, with the crash test dummy showing what would be severe burns. An attempt was also made using a chair with modern rockets attached; however, the uncontrollable craft proved that there were far too many complications for such a thing to have succeeded. It was determined that small rockets that can be strapped to a chair cannot provide sufficient thrust to effectively lift it, giving the legend the label of myth [...] "busted". The view the crew members had of the first test as it was performed matched what the legend said; after the smoke from the explosion had cleared, both Buster (the <b>crash-test</b> <b>dummy)</b> and the chair had disappeared, though Buster and the remains of the chair were found next to the 'launch-pad'.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research has been to develop a biofidelic <b>crash-test</b> <b>dummy</b> to facilitate design of seat systems with enhanced occupant protection in rear-end collisions. These frequent collisions may cause soft-tissue neck injuries to occupants in struck vehicles. These injuries, although mainly classified as minor, often lead to long-lasting complaints and large societal costs. There is currently no biofidelic mechanical dummy available for dynamic seat tests. Validation data for such a dummy are at present inadequate. Further, {{the knowledge of the}} injury mechanisms causing these short- and long-term complaints is incomplete and consequently injury criteria are sparse. Two aspects of the rear-impact injury enigma are studied in this thesis: volunteer kinematics, and development and validation of a dummy. In the volunteer studies, two series of rear-impact tests were performed to enable biofidelity assessment of models. Human kinematic responses in flexible laboratory seats with head restraints and in a rigid seat without head restraint were determined. High-speed video recorded the motions; accelerometers measured head and T 1 -vertebra accelerations. In the second series neck loads as well as the kinematics were estimated. It was found that, the torsos ramped up along the inclined seat backs during the impacts. The T 1 vertical displacements were approximately twice that of the pelvis due to straightening of the thoracic kyphosises in interaction with the seatback. In the first series the neck underwent flexion motion in several of the volunteers during the first 100 ms, followed by an extension motion. In the second series, all volunteers' upper-neck regions underwent flexion motion, then most of the lower-neck regions underwent extension motion simultaneously as their upper-neck region remained flexed. Most of the volunteers lower- and upper-neck regions underwent extension motion. As a basis {{for the development of a}} new dummy, bio-mechanical guidelines for rear-impact dummies were established by reviewing the literature. The first production version of the new rear impact dummy, the BioRID I, is based on the Hybrid III but it had a new segmented spine that was fitted with neck-muscle substitutes and a new soft torso. The kinematics of the BioRID I appeared to be more humanlike in rear impacts compared to the Hybrid III. A new prototype, the BioRID P 3, was then developed with improved neck-muscle substitutes and a softer thoracic spine and torso. The kinematic response of this prototype is close to those of the volunteers. The dummy also provides repeatable test results and the design appears to be reproducible. This prototype has been further developed and made into a production version, the BioRID II. Seat-system tests with biofidelic dummies, such as the BioRID II, in combination with appropriate injury criteria, will possibly facilitate the design of new seat-system designs with enhanced occupant protection in rear-end collisions...|$|E

(Barnett 2003) The invasion of Iraq by the US and UK {{was the subject of a}} seemingly unending stream of official justifications. Careening through the media like so many <b>crash-test</b> <b>dummies,</b> they ranged from narrowly nationalist calls for self-defense to apocalyptically universalist speeches about ridding the world of evil. Giving coherence to these trial-and-error efforts at legitimation was a freshly explicit American unilateralism that unsettled global business elites as much as it inspired an emergent global peace movement. Attorney General John Ashcroft, for example, apparently upset many of the secular evangelists of globalization at the World Economic Forum by appearing as a newly authoritarian and US-centric incarnation of “Davos Man ” (Landler 2003).

40|$|Experimental {{characterization}} of materials at elevated strain rates {{of the order of}} 10 (3) s(- 1) is typically performed by Hopkinson-bar-type facilities. The specific nature of Hopkinson bar tests is that a specimen is loaded by waves. As both the input and output bars are often made from high-impedance metallic materials, the ratio between transmitted and reflected wave components is very poor in the case of low-impedance specimen materials such as rubbers and foams. That poor wave transmission brings with it a limited quality of the signal-to-noise ratio. Changing the bar materials (e. g. to polycarbonate) is of little help because of the related viscous effects. A further deficiency of the wave-driven Hopkinson bar test for many rubber and foam applications is the comparably small amount of compression that is achievable. Maximum compressions of 95 per cent and above, often expected for damping and energy absorption applications, are out of the range of most Hopkinson bar set-ups. In order to overcome these deficiencies, first a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) facility was equipped with polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) thin-film sensors. Second, a direct-impact set-up for low-impedance materials was developed and calibrated at the Ernst Mach Institute (EMI). With the PVDF gauges, the range of application both for the SHPB and for the new set-up was enhanced. This is demonstrated with an SHPB-based investigation of stress homogeneity in polyurethane (PU) specimens. The direct-impact facility made it possible to derive the stress-strain relations for PU-rubber up to strain rates in the range of several 10 (3) s(- 1). Maximum compressions of more than 95 per cent were achieved. The paper describes the limitations of a classic SHPB set-up applied to low-impedance materials. The problem of stress homogeneity is addressed, and a set-up for a new direct-impact facility is presented. As an example application, a Confor-Blue foam, typically used for automotive <b>crash-test</b> <b>dummies,</b> is characterized at strain rates between 160 and 1115 s(- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. This study compares injury {{outcomes}} in vehicle crashes involving different age groups of belted passengers. Two datasets were considered. Firstly, UK national data revealed that younger passengers {{are much more}} likely to be involved in crashes per million miles travelled compared to older passengers although older passengers {{are much more likely}} to be killed or seriously injured compared to younger passengers. Secondly, in-depth vehicle crash injury data were examined to determine some of the underlying reasons for the enhanced injury risk amongst older passengers. In crashes of approximately equal severity, the older passenger group were significantly more likely to be fatally injured in frontal crashes (p< 0. 001). However young passengers were as equally likely to be killed in struck-side crashes compared to the older group. The results also showed that older passengers sustained more serious injuries to the chest region in frontal crashes compared with the younger aged group (p< 0. 0001) and it is this body region that is particularly problematic. When the data were analysed further, it was found that a large proportion of passengers were female and that in the majority of cases, the seat belt was responsible for injury. Since by the year 2030, 1 in 4 persons will be aged over 65 in most OECD countries, the results suggest a need for intervention through vehicle design including in-vehicle crashworthiness systems that take into account reduced tolerance to impact with ageing. It is generally acknowledged that the energy required to cause an injury reduces as a person ages (Augenstein, 2001). It therefore follows that older vehicle occupants are more vulnerable to injury in a crash compared with their younger counterparts. The skeletal structures of older persons are more easily damaged and the consequences of any assault are likely to be more serious compared with younger vehicle occupants because of reductions in bone strength and fracture tolerance (Dejammes and Ramet, 1996; Evans, 1991; Mackay, 1989; Viano et al, 1989). The high prevalence of osteoporosis particularly amongst females is well established (Berthel, 1980). Nevertheless, although manufacturers have an increased awareness of the physiological changes that take place in later life, the evidence upon which effective crash protection design is based is sparse, particularly regarding the needs of older occupants (Mackay, 1989). In one study, Foret-Bruno, (1978, 1989, in Dejammes and Ramet, 1996) concluded that older people could withstand a chest load of 5, 000 Newtons (equating to 50 mm of force-deflection on a Hybrid-III anthropomorphic <b>crash-test</b> <b>dummy)</b> whilst young people could withstand a chest load of 8, 000 Newtons (equating to 80 mm of force-deflection). The implication of this is that an older car occupant is several times more likely to sustain a life-threatening chest injury (Padmanaban, 2001). The chest is clearly a vulnerable area and the major load bearing area for restraint systems as well as a major point of contact with the vehicle structure in a crash. However, the level of personal mobility and independence afforded by the motorcar is valued highly by older people. Many older people in western countries now make an overwhelming proportion of their trips in private vehicles (OECD, 2001) compared with 30 years ago or so. With this in mind, there is a growing awareness of the need for vehicle safety to suit older occupants. In short, there is a need to improve the crashworthiness of vehicles to provide better protection for older occupants in the event of a crash. Although there is much data concerning driver performance degradation with ageing, the effect of ageing on injury outcomes in vehicle crashes is still largely unclear. Evans, (1991) noted that age effects are largely difficult to determine. This study follows on from previous work examining ‘Older Occupant’ outcomes in vehicle crashes. A previous study examined injury outcomes for ‘Older Drivers’ (Morris et al, 2002). Such studies are deemed necessary in view of the growing recognition of the increase in the numbers of elderly persons in most westernised societies. Moreover, as noted by Mackay and Hassan, (2000) more detailed crash data are needed to optimise vehicle crash performance. The aims of the study were deemed as follows; • To examine crash and injury characteristics that may affect older passenger outcomes in the event of a crash; • To make some preliminary assessment of the need for countermeasure development...|$|E
