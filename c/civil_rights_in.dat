5|$|In 1932twelve {{years after}} the ACLU was foundedit had {{achieved}} significant success; the Supreme Court had embraced the free speech principles espoused by the ACLU, {{and the general public}} was becoming more supportive of <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> general. But the Great Depression brought new assaults on civil liberties; the year 1930 saw a large {{increase in the number of}} free speech prosecutions, a doubling of the number of lynchings, and all meetings of unemployed persons were banned in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Among other reforms was the Codex Theresianus, {{begun in}} 1752 and {{finished}} in 1766, that defined <b>civil</b> <b>rights.</b> <b>In</b> 1776, Austria outlawed witch burnings and torture. It was later reintroduced, but the liberal {{nature of these}} reforms remains noted. Much unlike Joseph, but {{with the support of}} religious authorities, Maria Theresa was opposed to the abolition of torture. Born and raised between Baroque and Rococo eras, she found it hard to fit into the intellectual sphere of the Enlightenment, which is why she only slowly followed humanitarian reforms on the continent.|$|E

40|$|After the {{expansion}} of <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> laws <b>in</b> the early 1990 s, the number of <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> cases filed <b>in</b> U.

5|$|The {{documents}} {{most often}} cited to justifying {{the elimination of}} Native mascots are the advisory opinion by the United States Commission on <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>in</b> 2001 and a resolution by the American Psychological Association in 2005.

However, the issue is often discussed in the media in terms of feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the history and {{context of the use}} of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated.|$|E
5|$|Editorially, the {{newspaper}} {{remained in the}} liberal Republican camp, both strongly anti-communist and supportive of <b>civil</b> <b>rights.</b> <b>In</b> April, 1963, the Tribune published Martin Luther King's Letter from Birmingham Jail on its front page. The Tribune became a target of Barry Goldwater partisans in the 1964 presidential campaign. The leadership of the Tribune, while agreeing with Goldwater's approach to national defense, believed he pushed it to an extreme, and strongly opposed Goldwater's voting record on civil rights. After some internal debate, the Tribune endorsed Democrat Lyndon Johnson for the presidency that fall. The newspaper also {{played a major role}} in the election of New York City Mayor John Lindsay, a liberal Republican, in 1965.|$|E
