40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{our study}} was to {{describe}} succession related changes in humus profiles on moderate slopes of a tropical inselberg (Nouragues, French Guiana). Nine humus profiles were collected in a stratified manner under two main communities on well-drained sites: carpets of Pitcairnia geyskesii (Bromeliaceae) and shrub thickets of Clusia minor (Clusiaceae), the latter including two stages of its dynamic development. The 53 sampled layers were analysed by an optical method, the volume ratio of 109 classes of litter/humus components being quantified by a <b>count</b> <b>point</b> method. Correspondence analysis (CA) revealed marked differences among humus forms. Pitcairnia carpets were characterized by the dominance of cyanobacteria which formed crusts with low faunal activity, except when they were colonized by enchytraeid worms. With advancing succession, we observed that leaf litter did not accumulate but rather was incorporated into organo-mineral excrements of macro-invertebrates under C minor. The late developmental stage of Clusia thickets, characterised by the establishment of Myrcia saxatilis (Myrtaceae), showed {{a thick layer of}} undecayed litter and near absence of organo-mineral aggregates. The humus form varied from mor in cyano-bacterial crusts to tropical moder (with a few mull features) in Clusia thickets, but comparisons among humus profiles revealed more complex successional processes than expected {{on the basis of the}} composition of plant and soil animal communities...|$|E

The study was conducted in French Guiana (South America). Nine humus profiles (each comprised of a varying number of layers) were selected in shrub thickets (similar to 1 acre each) representative of three vegetation types of the rock savanna: canopies of pure Clusia minor (Clusiaceae), C. minor in mixture with Myrcia saxatilis (Myrtaceae) and zones of destruction. Using a dissecting microscope, a <b>count</b> <b>point</b> optical method for small soil volumes was employed to measure the volume ratio of each kind of humus component (107 categories) in the 62 layers sampled.

40|$|Underwater time- lapse video {{technology}} {{has been used to}} monitor adult spring and summer chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) escapement into the Secesh River and Lake Creek, Idaho, since 1998. Underwater time-lapse videography is a passive methodology that does not trap or handle this Endangered Species Act listed species. Secesh River chinook salmon represent a wild spawning aggregate that has not been directly supplemented with hatchery fish. The Secesh River is also a control stream under the Idaho Salmon Supplementation study. This project has successfully demonstrated the application of underwater video monitoring to accurately quantify chinook salmon abundance in Lake Creek in 1998, 1999, 2001 and 2002. The adult salmon spawner escapement into Lake Creek in 2002 was 410 fish. Jack salmon comprised 7. 1 percent of the run. Estimated hatchery composition was 6. 1 percent of the spawning run. The first fish passage on Lake Creek was recorded on June 26, 15 days after installation of the fish counting station. Peak net upstream movement of 41 adults occurred on July 8. Peak of total movement activity was August 18. The last fish passed through the Lake Creek fish counting station on September 2. Snow pack in the drainage was 91 % of the average during the winter of 2001 / 2002. Video determined salmon spawner abundance was compared to redd count expansion method point estimates in Lake Creek in 2002. Expanded index area redd count and extensive area redd <b>count</b> <b>point</b> estimates in 2002, estimated from one percent fewer to 56 percent greater number of spawners than underwater video determined spawner abundance. Redd count expansion methods varied from two percent fewer to 55 percent greater in 2001, 11 to 46 percent fewer in 1999 and 104 to 214 percent greater in 1998. Redd count expansion values had unknown variation associated with the point estimates. Fish per redd numbers determined by video abundance and multiple pass redd counts of the larger extensive survey areas in Lake Creek have varied widely. In 2002 there were 2. 05 fish per redd. There were 2. 07 fish per redd in 2001, 3. 58 in 1999 and in 1998, with no jacks returning to spawn, there were 1. 02 fish per redd. Migrating salmon in Lake Creek exhibited two behaviorally distinct segments of fish movement in 2002. Mainly upstream only movement of both sexes characterized the first segment. The second segment consisted of upstream and downstream movement with less net upstream movement and appeared to correspond with the time of active spawning. The fish counting stations did not impede salmon movements, nor was spawning displaced downstream. Fish moved freely upstream and downstream through the fish counting structures. The downstream movement of salmon afforded by this fish counting station design may be an important factor in the reproductive success of listed salmon. This methodology provides more accurate salmon spawner abundance information than expansion of single-pass and multiple-pass redd counts. Accurate adult escapement information would allow managers to determine if recovery actions benefited listed chinook salmon in tributary streams...|$|E
40|$|Report to Aitkin County Forestry Department; Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Non-game Division, Grand Rapids, MNBreeding bird {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} {{for the second consecutive}} year in the Cornish Hardwood management area (CHMA), located in northeast Aitkin County. The objectives of this project are to: 1) establish a long-term breeding bird monitoring program in the CHMA to detect annual changes in species abundances, 2) determine whether bird community composition and species abundances are affected by uneven-aged management, and 3) compare the bird community in the CHMA with other northern hardwood stands in northern Minnesota. This report provides a summary of bird surveys completed in June of 1999 and also compares 1998 and 1999 survey results. Please refer to the 1998 report for more detail on methods and rationale for this study. Twenty-six individual stands that were greater than 40 acres were selected for monitoring. Eight stands were harvested within the past 10 years (managed), eight stands are in the management area, but have not been recently managed (unmanaged), and ten sites were located in Savannah Portage State Park. One breeding bird survey was conducted at each point with an unlimited radius 10 minute <b>count</b> <b>point</b> count in Junes of 1998 and 1999. A total of 25 bird species were observed in 26 stands (52 points) in 1998 and 32 species were counted in 1999. Over both years, a total of 37 species have been observed in this area. On average, we observed about 22 individuals and 7 to 8 species in each stand (total of two point counts) in 1998 and a slightly higher number, about 25 individuals and 8 species in 1999. Results of a two-way analysis of variance for the bird community variables indicated that more (P < 0. 001) total individuals were observed in 1999 than in 1998. In addition, we found a significant difference in number of species observed in stands with different management history. Here, unmanaged stands had fewer species (P < 0. 01) than the managed or reference stands. Not one of the 8 species tested with two-way analysis of variance indicated a significant difference (P < 0. 05) in abundance among management types or year. We found a significant interaction for year and treatment for the Scarlet Tanager. This test result indicated that the species abundance pattern on unmanaged sites was not consistent between 1998 and 1999. For example, more Scarlet Tanagers were observed on unmanaged sites in 1998 than in the other two management groups, but in 1999, this management type had the fewest number of individuals of this species. A cluster analysis with bird species showed that bird community composition was not different among management types or between years. Occurrence of uncommon species on individual sites was most likely the reason why some sites differed in their relative cluster position (or composition of cluster) between the two years. A species that was absent in northern hardwood stands in this region in 1998 but present in 1999 was the Black-throated Blue Warbler. This species is rarely found in northern hardwoods in north central Minnesota but occurs in selected northern hardwood stands in northeast Minnesota, primarily in the Lake Superior highlands. A recently completed study on the Black-throated Blue Warbler in northeast Minnesota applied in managing in 1999 will provide quantitative habitat information for this species that could be the CHMA for this hardwood dependent species.

40|$|The Cornish Hardwood {{management}} area (CHMA), located in northeast Aitkin County is managed by Aitkin County forestry department and Minnesota Department of Natural Resources in an uneven-aged format. The forestry goals for {{this area are}} to provide wood resources for local industry and to promote regeneration and growth of high value hardwood trees by maintaining this forest type throughout each rotation. Northern hardwood forests provide habitat {{for a variety of}} breeding bird species, including several long-distant migrants. Although, response of breeding birds to successional forest stages from clearcut to mature stand ages are relatively well known and predictable for northern Minnesota forests, breeding bird response to uneven-aged management in northern hardwoods has not been studied in Minnesota. Our objectives were to: 1) establish a long-term breeding bird monitoring program in the CHMA to detect annual changes in species abundances, 2) determine whether bird community composition and species abundances are affected by uneven-aged management, and 3) compare bird community in the CHMA with other northern hardwood stands in northern Minnesota. Twenty-six individual stands that were greater than 40 acres were selected for monitoring. Eight stands were harvested within the past 10 years (managed), eight stands are in the {{management area}}, but have not been recently managed (unmanaged), and ten sites were located in Savannah Portage State Park. One breeding bird survey was conducted at each point with an unlimited radius 10 minute <b>count</b> <b>point</b> count. A total of 25 bird species were observed in 26 stands (52 points). On average, we observed about 22 individuals and 7 to 8 species in each stand (total of two point counts). No differences were detected in bird communities among management types. Two of the 15 species tested with analysis of variance indicated a significant difference (P < 0. 05) in abundance among management types. The Chestnut-sided Warbler and Winter Wren were more abundant in the managed than in the unmanaged or reference sites. Both of these species are associated with habitat features that occur shortly after forest management activities (shrubs or slash piles). A cluster analysis with bird species showed that bird community composition was not different among management types. Overall bird communities in all stands sampled regardless of management history were similar. This result indicates that uneven-aged management such as the type that has been lone at CHMA does not result in a forest structure that is different than what currently exists in other northern hardwood stands in this region. This result is similar to what we have found previously for other “old-growth” northern hardwood stands in the State. A species that was absent in northern hardwood stands in this region was the Black-throated Blue Warbler. This species is rarely found in northern hardwoods in north central Minnesota but occurs in selected northern hardwood stands in northeast Minnesota, primarily in the Lake Superior highlands. A study on the Black-throated Blue Warbler in northeast Minnesota in 1998 found that the species prefers northern hardwood stands with a shrub understory. In areas where there are few shrubs, the species was primarily associated with small gaps (in the range of 0. 05 to 0. 10 ha) in the canopy that have resulted from blowdowns. The natural disturbance regime for northern hardwoods in this region was windstorms which occur every few decades and create small forest gaps by blowing down senescent or weak and hollow trees. It is possible that the Black-throated Blue Warbler historically responded to habitat that was created by these gaps and moved across the landscape as new patches were created and old patches became unsuitable. It may be possible maintain the objectives for forest management in the CHMA by completing harvests that would result in the creation of small gaps. Another recommendation would be to chose harvest equipment that would have less impact on the understory vegetation (e. g., result in less skidding of trees). These management suggestions will not only provide more suitable habitat for avian species that require shrubs and saplings, but also a population of seedlings and saplings for future recruitment into the canopy.
