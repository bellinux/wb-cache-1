50|$|Next, {{consider}} two photons, {{one in each}} input mode of a 50:50 {{beam splitter}} (see figure 1). There are four possibilities for the photons to behave: 1) The photon <b>coming</b> in <b>from</b> above is reflected and the photon <b>coming</b> in <b>from</b> below is transmitted; 2) Both photons are transmitted; 3) Both photons are reflected; 4) The photon <b>coming</b> in <b>from</b> above is transmitted and the photon <b>coming</b> in <b>from</b> below is reflected. We assume now that the two photons are identical in their physical properties (i.e., polarization, spatio-temporal mode structure, and frequency).|$|R

5|$|The {{current line}} scheme of the R1 started {{operating}} on , after {{the dismantling of}} the former route of the Barcelona–Mataró–Maçanet-Massanes railway through the Barcelona neighborhood of Poblenou. Earlier, all the commuter rail services <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> Mataró used the route through Poblenou, terminating at Estació de les Rodalies, a terminus station that was located adjacent to the still existing Estació de França. All services <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> Mataró were then rerouted through the Sagrera rail complex and the Meridiana Tunnel to access Barcelona, terminating at L'Hospitalet de Llobregat or Barcelona–El Prat Airport stations, depending on the station of origin. The services <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> Mataró terminated at the airport, whilst the services <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> north of Mataró terminated at L'Hospitalet de Llobregat. Since the new through line scheme offered more stops within Barcelona and better connections with the city's metro system, the line's ridership doubled. Throughout 1989, this new line scheme was incorporated as part of line 1 of Rodalies Barcelona (predecessor of the R1), the Cercanías commuter rail system for the Barcelona area, created in the same year.|$|E

5|$|M87 is a {{very strong}} source of gamma rays, which are the most {{energetic}} rays of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> M87 have been observed since the late 1990s, but in 2006, using the High Energy Stereoscopic System Cherenkov telescopes, scientists have measured the variations of the gamma ray flux <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> M87, and found that the flux changes over a matter of days. This short period makes the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole in M87 the most promising source for these gamma rays. In general, the smaller the diameter of the emission source, the faster the variation in flux, and vice versa.|$|E
