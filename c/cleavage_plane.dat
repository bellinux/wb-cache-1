5|$|Unlike hardness, which denotes only {{resistance}} to scratching, diamond's toughness or tenacity is only fair to good. Toughness {{relates to the}} ability to resist breakage from falls or impacts. Because of diamond's perfect and easy cleavage, it is vulnerable to breakage. A diamond will shatter if hit with an ordinary hammer. The toughness of natural diamond has been measured as 2.0 MPa m1/2, which is good compared to other gemstones, but poor compared to most engineering materials. As with any material, the macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its {{resistance to}} breakage. Diamond has a <b>cleavage</b> <b>plane</b> and is therefore more fragile in some orientations than others. Diamond cutters use this attribute to cleave some stones, prior to faceting.|$|E
25|$|But it {{so happens}} that the atomic states at the <b>cleavage</b> <b>plane</b> are altered (compared to their bulk {{properties}} within the crystal) by the termination of the perfectly periodic lattice at that plane. Surface states at the cleaved plane have energy levels within the (otherwise forbidden) bandgap of the semiconductor.|$|E
25|$|Essentially, as a result, when light propagates {{through the}} <b>cleavage</b> <b>plane</b> and transits to free space {{from within the}} {{semiconductor}} crystal, {{a fraction of the}} light energy is absorbed by the surface states where it is converted to heat by phonon-electron interactions. This heats the cleaved mirror. In addition, the mirror may heat simply because the edge of the diode laser—which is electrically pumped—is in less-than-perfect contact with the mount that provides a path for heat removal. The heating of the mirror causes the bandgap of the semiconductor to shrink in the warmer areas. The bandgap shrinkage brings more electronic band-to-band transitions into alignment with the photon energy causing yet more absorption. This is thermal runaway, a form of positive feedback, and the result can be melting of the facet, known as catastrophic optical damage, or COD.|$|E

500|$|Somewhat {{related to}} {{hardness}} is another mechanical property toughness, {{which is a}} material's ability to resist breakage from forceful impact. The toughness of natural diamond has been measured as 7.5–10 MPa·m1/2. This value is good compared to other ceramic materials, but poor compared to most engineering materials such as engineering alloys, which typically exhibit toughnesses over 100 MPa·m1/2. As with any material, the macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its resistance to breakage. Diamond has a <b>cleavage</b> <b>plane</b> and is therefore more fragile in some orientations than others. Diamond cutters use this attribute to cleave some stones, prior to faceting. [...] "Impact toughness" [...] {{is one of the}} main indexes to measure the quality of synthetic industrial diamonds.|$|E
500|$|The {{mushrooms}} originate as minute fruit bodies (called [...] "pins" [...] due {{to their}} shape) from a yellow mycelium that forms a mat and tends to engulf pine needles. The pins, typically 1–2mm in diameter, lengthen vertically until they are roughly {{three or four times}} longer than they are thick. Until this point, the fruit body is a homogenous mass of tissue. It differentiates simultaneously into cap and stem along a <b>cleavage</b> <b>plane</b> (an axis along which any cell division occurs) from the outside inward, which gives rise to deep furrow encircling the fruit body. The hymenium is formed in the roof of this furrow, growing inward and upward from the outside edge. The cap develops from the upper section of this division, the stem from the lower.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the edge}} of a diode laser, where light is emitted, a mirror is {{traditionally}} formed by cleaving the semiconductor wafer to form a specularly reflecting plane. This approach is facilitated by the weakness of the [...] crystallographic plane in III-V semiconductor crystals (such as GaAs, InP, GaSb, etc.) compared to other planes. A scratch made at {{the edge of}} the wafer and a slight bending force causes a nearly atomically perfect mirror-like <b>cleavage</b> <b>plane</b> to form and propagate in a straight line across the wafer.|$|E

50|$|A {{breakage}} in diamonds {{that is not}} {{parallel to}} the <b>cleavage</b> <b>plane</b> {{is referred to as}} a fracture.

The effective stress field projected in the three different { 1 0 0 } <b>cleavage</b> <b>planes</b> is calculated for two different temperatures (50 and 200 K) and presented quantitatively, {{in the form of}} stress/frequency diagrams. It is shown that plastic activity tends to relax the stress acting in certain <b>cleavage</b> <b>planes</b> (the (0 1 0) and (0 0 1) planes) while, at the same time, amplifying the stress acting in other <b>cleavage</b> <b>planes</b> (the (1 0 0) planes). The selective stress amplification in the latter planes depends on the applied load direction, in combination with the limited set of available slip systems and the lath geometry. In the examined configuration, this selection effect is more pronounced with decreasing temperature, emphasizing the role of thermally activated plasticity on deformation-induced stress concentration...|$|R
25|$|Minerals {{with many}} {{cleavages}} might not break equally well {{in all of}} the directions; for example, calcite has good cleavage in three direction, but gypsum has perfect cleavage in one direction, and poor cleavage in two other directions.

40|$|This {{anatomical}} study {{describes the}} morphology {{of the human}} lumbar multifidus muscle through gross and chemical dissection of fresh cadavers. Previous morphological descriptions were analyzed with regard to fascicular divisions and <b>cleavage</b> <b>planes.</b> Gross dissection {{was performed on the}} lumbar multifidus of four fresh adult human cadavers and four preserved cadavers. Gradual chemical dissection using nitric or formic acid was used for connective tissue digestion to enhance the documentation of muscle fiber direction. Results revealed four distinct layers of the lumbar multifidus separated by <b>cleavage</b> <b>planes.</b> The superficial layer was more extensive than previously described with bony attachments at both the origin and insertion at several vertebral levels. The attachments of the second through fourth layers differed in that distinct <b>cleavage</b> <b>planes</b> between the various fascicles were not found with chemical dissection. The lumbar multifidus has a multipennate fiber arrangement, and the fascicles between the various layers inter-attach. Inter-fascicle attachment differs with the description by Macintosh et al of distinct <b>cleavage</b> <b>planes</b> between and within the fascicles of each layer. Accurate anatomical knowledge of the fascicles of the lumbar multifidus is integral for defining the actions of this complex lumbar muscle. This study supports the clinical belief that the multifidus has a significant role in control and stabilization of the lumbar spine in multiple planes of action. The multipennate arrangement of this muscle with fascicular inter-attachment supports the clinical premise that the multifidus is activated in a variety of positions and can potentially produce and mediate intersegmental mobility and provide proprioception...|$|R
