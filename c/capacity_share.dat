50|$|However, {{the cement}} kiln patents proved valueless, since rotary kilns {{were already in}} place or being {{installed}} by their competitors. In the ensuing decade, {{the majority of the}} rotary kilns installed in Britain were installed by the competition, including several newly launched companies. Because of the disastrous circumstances of the company launch, it was short of cash and could ill afford investment. By 1910 its capacity remained 1.25 million tons per annum, although competing capacity had risen to 1.8 million tons. Although a few favored plants had been uprated, the majority of the original 35 had been shut down. In 1911, a second attempt was made to unify the industry. 33 companies, including all the original drop-outs, were merged to form the British Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd.. This time, a substantial number of plants outside the London area were involved. Again, a small but significant number of companies refused to join. The combined APCM and BPCM companies now controlled 80% of national capacity, in 58 plants. This pattern became a template for subsequent history: declining <b>capacity</b> <b>share</b> was periodically boosted by acquisition of competitors, and the company continued to maintain 60-70% of British capacity until its demise.|$|E

However, it stipulated that all British airlines' combined share of the total capacity on that route could not exceed the combined <b>capacity</b> <b>share</b> of all French airlines, and that all capacity increases needed to be mutually agreed by both sides. As Air France was the only airline the French government had designated to serve this route, this effectively meant that BA and BCal were compelled to share between themselves the 50% of the total capacity between London and Paris that had been allocated to the UK. It also gave Air France an effective veto over any capacity increase, thereby allowing that airline to dictate the pace at which additional capacity could be added. It took BCal 15 years to attain a 20% share of the London—Paris market's total capacity since it commenced scheduled operations on that route.|$|E

These quantities are computed by observing the number of refused, accepted, and active (i. e., possibly generating bursts) calls within the previous decision interval, and are assumed to be slowly varying with respect to the cell dynamics.

The utilization of such applications is constantly increasing in public safety networks and so does the need to dimension and configure TETRA networks to meet their reliability, delay and loss requirements. Without an efficient radio resource management (RRM), one operator can exhaust the capacity of others. This study tackles an efficient scheduling to provide maximum system throughput and proportional fairness in accordance with operator <b>capacity</b> <b>share</b> through adaptive resource allocation scheme. We refer to this new scheme as multi-operators time division generalized processor sharing scheme (M-TDGPS). It employs both adaptive rate allocation to maximize the resource utilization and GPS techniques to provide fair services for each operator. The performance analysis of this scheme is derived using the GPS performance model and compared with the normal static rate M-TDGPS scheme. The simulation results show that the proposed adaptive rate M-TDGPS scheduling scheme improves both system utilization (throughput) and average delays.

A cost-driven forecasting model for basic chemicals production is developed, accounting for regional production costs, demand growth and stock turnover. The model determines the global production capacity placement, implementation of energy-efficient Best Practice Technology (BPT) and global carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions for the period 2010 – 2030. Subsequently, the effects of energy and climate policies on these parameters are quantified.

On the other hand, uncertainties strongly affect modeling and consequently, strategic analysis of generation firms in the medium term. Therefore, models considering these uncertainties are highly required. Among uncertain variables considered in the medium term generation planning, demand and hydro inflows are of the greatest importance. This paper proposes a new approach for simulating the operation of power market in medium-term, taking into account demand and hydro inflows uncertainties. The demand uncertainty is considered using Monte-Carlo simulations. Standard Deviation over Expected Profit (SDEP) of generation firms based on simulation results is introduced as a new index for analyzing {{the influence of the}} demand uncertainty on the behavior of market players. The correlation between <b>capacity</b> <b>share</b> of market players and their SDEP is also demonstrated. The uncertainty of inflow as a stochastic variable is dealt using scenario tree representation. Rational uncertainties as strategic behavior of generation firms, intending to maximize their expected profit, is considered and Nash-Equilibrium is determined using the Cournot model game. Market power mitigation effects through financial bilateral contracts as well as demand elasticity are also investigated. Case studies confirm that this representation of electricity market provides robust decisions and precise information about electricity market for market players which can be used in the generation expansion planning framework...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{extends the}} spare {{capacity}} allocation (SCA) problem from single link failure [1] to dual link failures on mesh-like IP or WDM networks. The SCA problem pre-plans traffic flows with mutually disjoint one working and two backup paths using the shared backup path protection (SBPP) scheme. The aggregated spare provision matrix (SPM) {{is used to}} capture the spare <b>capacity</b> <b>sharing</b> for dual link failures. Comparing to a previous work by He and Somani [2], this method has better scalability and flexibility. The SCA problem is formulated in a non-linear integer programming model and partitioned into two sequential linear sub-models: one finds all primary backup paths first, and the other finds all secondary backup paths next. The results on five networks show that the network redundancy using dedicated 1 + 1 + 1 is {{in the range of}} 313 - 400 %. It drops to 96 - 181 % in 1 : 1 : 1 without loss of dual-link resiliency, but with the trade-off of using the complicated <b>share</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>sharing</b> among backup paths. The hybrid 1 + 1 : 1 provides intermediate redundancy ratio at 187 - 310 % with a moderate complexity. We also compare the passive/active approaches which consider spare <b>capacity</b> <b>sharing</b> after/during the backup path routing process. The active sharing approaches always achieve lower redundancy values than the passive ones. These reduction percentages are about 12 % for 1 + 1 : 1 and 25 % for 1 : 1 : 1 respectively.

More and more applications with narrow latency requirements are emerging which are not well addressed by existing proposals. In this paper we present TCP Scalable Increase Adaptive Decrease (SIAD), a new congestion control scheme supporting both high speed and low latency. More precisely, our algorithm aims to provide high utilization under various networking conditions, and therefore would allow operators to configure small buffers for low latency support. To provide full scalability with high speed networks, we designed TCP SIAD based on a new approach that aims for a fixed feedback rate independent of the available bandwidth. Further, our approach provides a configuration knob for the feedback rate. This can be used by a higher layer control loop to impact the <b>capacity</b> <b>share,</b> potentially at the cost of higher congestion, e. g. for applications that need a minimum rate. We evaluated TCP SIAD against well-known high-speed congestion control schemes, such as Scalable TCP and High Speed TCP, as well as H-TCP that among other goals targets small buffers.

The success of geographical distributed plants depends strongly {{on the use of}} opportune tools to integrate their resources and demand forecast in order to gather a specific production objective. The framework proposed is based on two different tools: a cooperative game algorithm, based on the Gale–Shapley model, and a fuzzy engine. The capacity allocation policy takes into account the utility functions of the involved firms. It is shown how the capacity allocation policy proposed induces all firms to report truthfully their information about their requirements. A discrete event simulation environment has been developed to test the proposed FCSCM. The numerical results show the drastic reduction of unsatisfied capacity obtained by the model of cooperation implemented in this work...|$|R
