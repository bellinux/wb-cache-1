40|$|Three {{types of}} antimony-based, opaque ceramic colours {{were used in}} the faience {{workshop}} of Le Bois d'Épense during {{the first decades of the}} 19 th century; that is, yellow, tawny and green. Yellow is generated by lead antimonate crystals (Naples Yellow), which are incorporated into an uncoloured glass matrix. According to SEM–EDS measurements, these pigments contain iron. The tawny colour is the optical result of the combined presence of similar yellow, iron-bearing lead antimonate particles in a Fe-rich, brownish glass matrix. The green opaque colour is produced by the combination of a blue cobalt glass and yellow Pb–Sn–Fe-antimonate crystals. Cores of zoned pigments lighten the recipes, according to which the pigments were produced. First, they were synthesized by calcination, ground and then mixed with a colourless, brown or blue glass powder. The resulting powder mixture was added to a liquid agent and used as high-temperature <b>ceramic</b> <b>colour...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is {{essential}} to characterize an object's reflectance properties. This function depends both on the various illumination-observation geometries {{as well as on}} the wavelength. As a result, the comprehensive interpretation of the data becomes rather complex. In this work we assess the use of the multivariable analysis technique of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) applied to the experimental BRDF data of a <b>ceramic</b> <b>colour</b> standard. It will be shown that the result may be linked to the various reflection processes occurring on the surface, assuming that the incoming spectral distribution is affected by each one of these processes in a specific manner.

40|$|Colour {{competence}} {{is often seen}} as a basic knowledge introduced in the early stage of product design education. A knowledge gap was identified that required more advanced learning outcomes for colour in curriculums of product design education at master levels. How can colour knowledge in product design contribute to corporate social responsibility? This was explored through a case study approach. The first case study was a master student’s development of various bottle-green glass lamps {{in collaboration with the}} glass industry. The second case was the development of shades of blue in a <b>ceramic</b> <b>colour</b> surface used in public art in a chapel of rest. The third case was the use of signal yellow colour to demonstrate interface areas in an offshore context in the oil industry. The implementation of all solutions concerned both technical challenges and people’s emotional experiences of what was meaningful in each context. The learning outcomes of the study were an expanded understanding of how colour can be substantial in certain contexts. The first was that knowledge about technical premises in materials was needed to design colour surfaces. The second was that ethnographic competence was needed to analyse possible emotional experiences of colour in various cultures. The third was that competence in product semantics is needed to implement a coherent use of colour as indexical signs in health, environment, and safet...|$|E

40|$|Companies in the frit, glaze, and <b>ceramic</b> <b>colour</b> {{producing}} subsector know a {{great deal}} about the different frit-manufacturing process stages such as raw materials milling and mixing, as well as fusing the raw materials mixture to obtain the frit. This knowledge can be used to break new ground in frit applications and to obtain products with high added value, such as bioactive glasses. Bioactive glasses are amorphous materials that are able to interact with bone cells, thanks to surface growth of a hydroxycarbonate apatite (HCA) layer when they enter into contact with a biological fluid. This bioactivity, together with their relatively low cost compared to that of the materials used at present, makes such materials particularly attractive for obtaining prosthesis and implant coatings. Among the numerous coating methods, atmospheric plasma spraying is one of the most widely used techniques for industrial-scale deposition of this type of coating owing to its versatility, simplicity, and relatively low cost. This study presents a methodology for obtaining bioactive glass coatings by thermal plasma spraying. The methodology includes: frit synthesis; design, preparation and characterisation of appropriate powders and bioactive glass suspensions for thermal plasma spraying; optimisation of the deposition conditions for the obtainment of coatings from powders as well as from suspensions; and characterisation of the end coatings. It was verified that, after deposition, the resulting coatings exhibited the typical microstructure of layers deposited by thermal plasma spraying. In this case, as feedstock of a glassy nature was involved, the microstructure consisted of a matrix of flattened drops of molten glass, together with rounded pores and cracks. The results obtained also indicated that the amorphous nature of the jetted frit was maintained in the end coating, as was intended. However, low adhesion to the substrate was also observed, it being necessary to use a bonding layer between the substrate and the bioactive glass layer. Consequently, further investigation is needed to improve the bond strength and other properties of these coatings, as well as to evaluate their bioactivity.

40|$|AbstractPlasma dissociated zircon (PDZ) has {{attractive}} {{applications in}} <b>ceramic</b> <b>colouring,</b> {{as well as}} the preparation of fine ZrO 2 crystals, coatings and refractory materials. Generally the PDZ is obtained from different natural or synthetic zircon powders, if the cooling rate is high enough a complete dissociation is achieved, with rounded (dendritic) zirconia grains imbibed in a fused silica (non crystalline) matrix. The principal objective of this work is to establish the influence of the incorporation of both products of the zircon dissociation (fused silica and crystalline zirconia) to the initial powders mixture utilized for the processing of PDZ in an indigenous thermal plasma argon furnace. Both structural and microstructural characterization was carried out. A thermal annealing at 1500 ¼C with different soaking time (1 - 15 hours) was completed in order to establish the thermal stability to the thermodynamically favoured recombination, showing that after this time a recombination was achieved, and this behaviour was not influenced by the Zr:Si ratio. The addition of fused silica resulted in an important decrease of the zirconia grains size, while the zirconia addition had the opposite result, showing that within this range (1 - 10 μm) the final zirconia grains size can be selected and controlled with this processing variable. The present processing route showed an alternative way for obtaining different size of monoclinic zirconia powder...|$|R

50|$|Further {{experimentation}} in the platinum smelters’ laboratories {{resulted in}} a variety of inventions and revolutionary new production processes. These included the production of pharmaceutical iron compounds, chemically pure hydrofluoric acid, rubidium and caesium. Most production at this time still involved platinum, which was used in more and more applications due to its chemical and physical properties. As it is also highly resistant to acids and heat, platinum was also used to make instruments such as scientific tools, crucibles and vessels used in chemistry and physics. As early as the 19th century, platinum had already been used in locking pins to hold false teeth in place. Platinum was also used to make filaments in light bulbs and non-corrosive electrical contacts in telephones. As the company continued to expand, it needed new premises - so in 1896, the W.C. Heraeus Platinum Smelting Factory was established just outside Hanau, employing 40 people. Two years later, Wilhelm and Heinrich Heraeus, the two sons of the company founder, took over as managers. They were responsible for pushing ahead with research and development, and bringing on board a former school friend, the physicist and chemist Richard Küch. Küch, who became a director in 1909, had many contacts in the world of science and continued to carry out fundamental research, resulting in further growth in the company. Among his achievements were the development of a process to melt rock crystal at around 2000 °C to produce quartz glass. The quartz glass produced by the company was almost entirely free of defects and was of outstanding purity. It is still used in medicine today and is a highly sought-after material in manufacturing on account of its translucence and resistance to heat and acids. With the advent of <b>ceramic</b> <b>colours,</b> more and more platinum was needed for production processes and Heraeus started supplying products to the electrochemical and plastics industries. By the beginning of the 20th century, a major platinum processing boom was underway, caused by demand in the chemicals industry for large volumes of platinum thermocouples and platinum-rhodium catalysts needed to produce nitric acid.|$|R

In the case of Er 6 MoO 12, orange–yellow colours were observed at calcination temperatures of 1200 °C and 1300 °C with different soaking times. Examination of the X-ray diffraction pattern generated after heat treatment at 1200 °C for 2 h revealed the single-phase nature of the compound. However, when applied to unleaded commercial transparent glaze, the pigment powder changed to a light pink colour indicating instability of the pigment in the glaze. Similarly mixed oxides such as Ba 0. 5 La 0. 5 Na 0. 5 Cu 0. 5 Si 4 O 10 and Ba 0. 5 La 0. 5 Na 0. 5 Cu 0. 5 Si 2 O 6 produced vivid blue and violet–blue colour powders, respectively when calcined between 950 °C and 1050 °C for different soaking times. X-ray diffraction patterns for Ba 0. 5 La 0. 5 Na 0. 5 Cu 0. 5 Si 4 O 10 showed {{the presence of the}} phases which included (a) BaCuSi 4 O 10 (b) La 2 Si 2 O 7 (c) SiO 2 and La 2 O 3 (trace) whereas Ba 0. 5 La 0. 5 Na 0. 5 Cu 0. 5 Si 2 O 6 confirmed the presence of the phases such as (a) BaCuSi 4 O 10 and (b) BaCuSi 2 O 6. These pigment powders were also not stable and light-green colours were observed when they were immersed in the unleaded commercial transparent glaze. Finally, AxB(2 −x−y) CryO 3 (A = rare earth and B = Al) perovskite-type compounds produced a variety of shades of red and yellow colour depending on the rare earth, the value of x and y, and the calcination temperature. An intense brownish-red colour was obtained when the rare earth Erbium was used with x = 1, y = 0. 06. From the X-ray diffraction trace, Er (Al Cr) O 3 was found to be the only phase present. SEM micrographs indicated the presence of agglomerates as well as two different types of crystals in terms of morphology. EDX spectra confirmed that both types of crystals had the same composition.

40|$|Scholarly archaeological {{research}} into the African diaspora in Atlantic Canada is quite limited to date. The discourse in history has been more regularly attended here but, given the sociopolitical challenges {{that members of the}} African diaspora faced, archaeology is a vital and perhaps more democratic source of information to understand this heritage and its importance to modern Atlantic Canadians. This thesis represents an effort to begin to fill this need. [...] Localized cultural variation is a factor for which scholars must allow, however the discourse on African diaspora archaeology has demonstrated that some common, Africentric cultural phenomena link populations across the wide geography of the colonial African diaspora through both their African cultural heritage and experiences as members of this diaspora. This thesis, using a specific focus on Black Loyalists and their descendents in Nova Scotia, contends that early black settlers in Atlantic Canada embodied varying degrees and facets of West African cultural traditions. These have contributed to modern black culture and ethnocultural identity in Atlantic Canada and must be seen in both their contemporary and historic contexts as African diasporic in nature. [...] This research uses several approaches to understand the emic perspective of African Nova Scotian identity and local cultural heritage. These include a comparative study of consumption behavior through an analysis of <b>ceramic</b> decorative <b>colours</b> and motifs, an attempt to comprehend cultural landscapes at regional, community and household levels and a consideration of ethnocultural identity through materially expressed Africentric spirituality and folk traditions. Further, this thesis demonstrates that, since the material traces of such Africentric practices and perspectives lack any substantial documentary record to assist in their comprehension, the adoption of an Africentric perspective to archaeological field methodology and interpretation is necessary for both detecting the evidence and understanding it. [...] Data from several Black Loyalist communities were analyzed to address the varied objectives including Delap's Cove (Annapolis Co.), Rear Monastery (Antigonish & Guysborough Cos.), Birchtown (Shelburne Co.) and a white Irish community, Coote Cove (Halifax Regional Municipality). Data from previous research was used from the latter two communities, whereas the author collected data specifically for this research from the two former communities. ...|$|R
