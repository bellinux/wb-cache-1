50|$|As mineral {{deposits}} {{began to}} be discovered {{up and down the}} Colorado River in the early 1860s, numerous mining camps and steamboat ports grew into towns along the river. Heading north from Yuma, prospectors staked gold and silver claims along the river and in the surrounding mountains. The Castle Dome Mining Company, established in 1863 and owned by Conner and Jacob Snively, purchased many of these claims and planned out the site of Castle Dome Landing {{on the banks of the}} Colorado River to act as a shipping point for ore on its way to California for smelting.

A sandstone-shale-carbonate association of shallow marine origin hosts the mineralization. Copper sulfide mineralizations in sandstones are stratabound and disseminated type and lead sulfide mineralizations occur as stratabound fracture filling veins and/or replacement veins within dolomite. Systematic mineralogical and sulfur, carbon and oxygen isotope {{studies of the}} three deposits indicate that the same ore-fluid that deposited copper at Nallakonda at relatively higher temperature, also deposited <b>copper-lead</b> at Dhukonda and lead at Bandalamottu under progressive cooling during migration through sediments.

This was enabled by using a Cu:Pb ratio of 1 : 3 in the electrolyte. The composition of <b>copper-lead</b> alloys was influenced by metal ion ratio in the bath. This study focused {{on the process of}} electrodeposition of <b>copper-lead</b> alloy (lead content in the deposit up to 20 %) from methane sulfonic acid electrolyte. The anode material used was graphite. Methanesulfonic acid is an alternative electrolyte system which could replace others acid in practical. The results were consistent with the behaviour of a regular plating system with copper being the preferentially depositable metal. It has been shown that the lead (the less noble metal) content in the deposits increases at an increase in current density in the electrolyte. The properties (surface microstructure, phase composition and crystallite size) of the electrodeposits were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX). The results showed that the deposits consist of a mixture of fine crystals of the two metals and the morphology of the deposits is mainly controlled by the composition of the deposit. It is confirmed that there is a formation obtained in MSA were exhibiting fine and rough, quietly uniformity, crystalline and moderately adherence on the cathode surface. According to the XRD result, the crystal structure of the <b>copper-lead</b> alloy coatings is face-centred cubic (FCC) structure.

40|$|A {{literature}} review {{has shown that}} the chemical effects of grinding media on the flotation of real ores, especially those containing pyrite, are still not understood adequately. Many studies have been conducted on isolated minerals or in solutions only, and transport phenomena in the froth phase have generally been ignored in studies on galvanic interactions. A complex ore containing galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite and significant quantities of magnetite, pyrrhotite and pyrite was used in batch flotation tests to study this problem. Metallic iron powder was added in different quantities to a ceramic ball mill in order to simulate the use of mild steel grinding media in flotation tests aimed at selectively floating chalcopyrite. An oxygen-saturated pulp milled in the presence of iron yielded the best recovery of chalcopyrite and <b>copper-lead</b> selectivity. Milling under a nitrogen atmosphere in the absence of metallic iron resulted in poor <b>copper-lead</b> selectivity. The galvanic interaction caused by the presence of iron yielded a stable, well-drained froth with low ratios of solids/water recovery and larger bubbles in the froth. However, milling in the absence of iron caused an extremely brittle froth with very fine bu bubbles, high recoveries of low grades of sulphur. In contrast with the improvement in the copper recovery and <b>copper-lead</b> selectivity obtained when the pulp was pre-aerated after milling in the presence of iron, no significant increase in the copper grade was observed after extensive pre-aeration when milling occurred in the absence of iron. The unsatisfactory flotation results in the absence of iron could be explained by the enhanced floatability of iron-bearing gangue minerals, which rupture films and suppress froth stability owing to bubble-overloading. © 1993.

No other method of ore treatment has ever effected such great changes in metallurgical practice in so short a time.

40|$|The compatibilities {{of various}} monotectic alloy systems with several {{different}} crucible materials were evaluated. The study {{was carried out}} using small candidate alloy samples of compositions that produced fifty volume percent of each liquid phase at the monotectic temperature. Compatibility {{was based on the}} evaluation of the wetting tendency of the two immiscible phases with the crucible material in a one-g solidified sample. Three types of wetting phenomena were observed during the evaluation. Type 1 indicates an alloy-crucible combination where the L 2 phase preferentially wets the crucible material. Since L 2 is usually the minority phase in desirable alloys, this material combination would be difficult to process and is therefore considered incompatible. Type 2 behavior indicates an alloy-crucible combination where the L 1 phase preferentially wets the crucible material. This type of combination is considered compatible since surface tension effects should aid in processing the alloy to a useful form. Type 3 indicates any combination that leads to major reactions between the alloy and crucible material, gas entrapment, or separation of the metal from the crucible wall. Additional compatibility evaluations would have to be carried out on combinations of this category.

40|$|Graduation date: 1952 In the mid 1930 's the Diesel engine, which {{formerly}} {{was used}} {{only as a}} large, low-speed machine, was developed into a smaller high-speed engine for use in trucks, busses, and tractors. Along with these changes in mechanical design came many problems, of which a major one was lubrication. Because ordinary mineral lubricating oils quickly deteriorate, certain chemical compounds were mixed with the oils to improve their performance. Introduction of the chemical additives to the Diesel engine lubricants met with considerable success and the practice was soon followed in spark-ignition engine lubrication. The additives used now include such chemical compounds as anti-oxidants, anti-corrosive agents, extreme pressure agents, viscosity index improvers, and pour point depressants. In addition to the compounds developed by petroleum and chemical companies, other commercial addition agents, which are sold in auto supply stores and service stations, have appeared with many and varied claims. Today {{there are many of}} these "patent medicine" mixtures on the market. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the stability of a representative group of these commercial addition agents in an internal combustion engine. A small single cylinder, water-cooled Lauson was used as the test engine. It was mounted on a test stand with a direct current generator and a control panel. The procedure followed in the tests was adapted from the Coordinating Research Council Handbook. It consisted of a standardized break-in period with a reference oil, and a test time of 36 -hours with an additive-reference oil mixture. The reference oil, of high rating, was procured from the Coordinating Research Council for the control in these tests. The oil or additive mixture, after the 36 -hour test period, was analyzed by the following ASTM tests: Gravity, viscosity at 100 F and 210 F, flash and fire points, water and sediment, neutralization number, precipitation number, and copper strip corrosion. Photomicrographs were taken to observe the extent of corrosion on <b>copper-lead</b> bearing sections, cut from a bearing whose composition was 65 per cent copper and 35 per cent lead. These specimens had been present in the sump during the test run. Two different oil temperatures were utilized to obtain extremes in operating conditions.

The first value simulated long, hot weather, driving conditions and the second town driving with many starts and stops and low oil temperature. The results of the tests are summarized as follows: 1. The addition of water to the crankcase accelerated the deterioration of the additive-reference oil mixture. 2.
