25|$|Yersinia pestis (formerly Pasteurella pestis) is a Gram-negative, {{rod-shaped}} <b>coccobacillus,</b> non mobile with no spores. It is a {{facultative anaerobic}} organism that can infect humans via the oriental rat flea. It causes the disease plague, which takes three main forms: pneumonic, septicemic, and bubonic plagues. All three forms {{were responsible for}} a number of high-mortality epidemics throughout human history, including: the 6th century's Plague of Justinian, the Black Death, which accounted for the death of at least one-third of the European population between 1347 and 1353, and the Third Pandemic, sometimes referred to as the Modern Plague, which began in the late 19th century in China and spread by rats on steamboats claiming close to 10 million lives. These plagues probably originated in China and were transmitted west via trade routes.|$|E
500|$|Oriental rat fleas, Xenopsylla cheopis, {{can carry}} the <b>coccobacillus</b> Yersinia pestis. The {{infected}} fleas feed on rodent vectors of this bacterium, {{such as the}} black rat, Rattus rattus, and then infect human populations with the plague, as has happened repeatedly from ancient times, as in the Plague of Justinian in 541–542. [...] Outbreaks killed up to 200 million people across Europe between 1346 and 1671. The Black Death pandemic between 1346 and 1353 likely killed {{over a third of}} the population of Europe.|$|E
