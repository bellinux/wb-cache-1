2500|$|The SR22, {{certified}} in November 2000, {{is a more}} powerful version of the earlier SR20. The SR22 is a low-wing cantilever monoplane of composite construction, featuring fixed (non-retractable) tricycle landing gear with a <b>castering</b> <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> and steering via differential braking on the main wheels. It {{is powered by a}} nose-mounted 310hp (231kW) Continental IO-550-N [...] piston engine. The four-seat cabin is accessed through doors {{on either side of the}} fuselage.|$|E

40|$|A {{full-scale}} {{investigation has}} been conducted {{to determine the effect}} of various factors on the shimmy of castering wheels. The factors considered were the geometric arrangement, the tire types, the variations of load, the spindle moment of inertia, and the tire inflation. A comparison {{of the results of the}} present investigation with those calculated from existing theory was made. The constants needed in the calculations to determine the damping required for a castering wheel were measured. The results indicate that solid friction appears to be impracticable as the sole damping agent for <b>castering</b> <b>nose</b> <b>wheels</b> on large airplanes. Also it was concluded that the existing theory is adequate for calculating the damping required to prevent shimmy. The caster angle and the spindle moment of inertia were found to influence the solid friction required to prevent shimmy. The effect of variations in the type and the pressure of the tire was insignificant...|$|R

5000|$|The NGP mock-up {{displayed}} at AOPA Air Expo 2006, in Palm Springs, California had five seats. The aircraft was, at that time, intended be {{powered by a}} Lycoming IO-580 FADEC [...] engine controlled by a single power lever. The design mock-up had four doors with a separate baggage door on the left side, tricycle landing gear with a <b>castering</b> <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> and a forward-swept high-mounted wing of relatively small area.|$|E

50|$|The Fernic T-9 {{can be seen}} as a {{conventional}} twin engined monoplane with the addition of a 22 ft long nose mounted canard foreplane to provide two lifting surfaces in tandem. The canard was designed to stall ahead of the main wing, reducing the risk of stalling or spinning the entire aircraft. The plywood covered aircraft also featured tricycle landing gear with a <b>castering</b> <b>nose</b> <b>wheel.</b> A spring steel tail skid was added to protect the tail.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> is {{attached}} to the two rear engine mounts by y-shaped steel tubes attached to a steel tube with a shaft that slides freely with the wheel. Cables run underneath the belly directly from fixtures on the rudder pedals to the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> shaft. This gave the ability to steer by pivoting the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> shaft with the rudder pedals. The shock system consisted of six circular bungee cords, sometimes four for softer landings, located {{on either side of the}} <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> shaft to ears on the top tube and the bottom shaft connected to the wheel.|$|R
5000|$|The PA-11 {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{aircraft}} to be used in experiments with the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> (also known as tricycle gear) configuration. Although its original design is intended to be a tail-dragger, a modification was created to mount a <b>nose</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{landing gear}} is of {{tricycle}} configuration {{and all three}} sprung gear legs are made from 4130 chrome-molybdenum steel alloy. The <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> is free-castering. On early versions the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> steering was by differential braking via two finger-controlled brake handles mounted on the centre console. On later versions more conventional toe brakes were installed.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{aircraft}} ground handling characteristics and airport working efficiency, large handling angle and torque are requested for the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> steering system of large civil aircraft. A following swivel selector valve is firstly {{designed to meet the}} demand for the hydraulic pressure commutating as soon as the dual actuator <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> steering mechanism passes through its dead center position. Considering the multiple objective functions of <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> steering mechanisms, those core design parameters are multiobjective optimized. A <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> steering electrohydraulic servo system with handling and antishimmy functions is designed for the steering mechanism. Then the prototypes of the steering mechanism and electrohydraulic servo system are researched to validate the design. Using the swing actuator to provide the load torque and ground excitation, the steering test bench is prepared to test the system working. The steering test and the antishimmy test are conducted to verify the functions of the system. The test results, such as steer angle, steer torque hydraulic pressure, and antishimmy torque, are analyzed in detail and compared with the theoretical results. The results show that the property of the prototype achieves the design objectives, such as work mode, steer angle, and steer torque...|$|R
