5000|$|Event '76 is {{the seventh}} {{album of the}} jazz fusion band Area, and the second live album. It was {{recorded}} in Milan's Università Statale in 1976, though released in 1979. Ares Tavolazzi and Giulio Capiozzo are noticeably absent, as when this album was recorded, they had temporarily left the band, only to return a few months later.This album is noticeable for featuring Steve Lacy on saxophone and Paul Lytton on percussion, {{and it is also}} noticeable for featuring a lengthy version of [...] "Caos IIa Parte", which was split between {{the two sides of the}} LP due to time reasons. The live version of [...] "Caos IIa Parte" [...] was more improvised than the studio piece: each musician was given a sheet of paper in which there was written a word ("sex", [...] "irony", [...] "violence") and he had to interpret it for three minutes, then <b>change</b> <b>sheet</b> of paper. Each musician had a different sheet of paper.The title track is a variation of the song [...] "SCUM" [...] from the album Maledetti (Maudits). An aftershow interview with Tofani, Fariselli and Stratos was released as a bonus track on some editions of Maledetti (Maudits). This was the last album of the classic era featuring Paolo Tofani (he left the band in late 1977, but returned in 2009), and Demetrio Stratos, who died some months after the release of this record.|$|E

3000|$|It is {{attractive}} to regard the <b>change</b> in <b>sheet</b> resistance in terms of re-oxidation of the surface, i.e., the re-formation of oxide interface states from {{the condition of the}} surface produced by H termination. The simplest situation for the H-terminated surface would be complete passivation of surface states by H (including the [...] "poisoning" [...] of the clean-surface bands produced by the 2 × 1 reconstruction) [2, 3]. If one adopts this model, then the evolution of sheet resistance plots the re-oxidation rate, and differences in re-oxidation rates of the NMs can be very sensitively inferred from the <b>change</b> of <b>sheet</b> resistance. There will then be a crossover point at 8 h where the degrees of oxidation of the two surface terminations switch. The VH termination appears then to be much more resistive to re-oxidation, i.e., it provides a much better surface chemical passivation than HF etching.|$|R

40|$|Mass balance {{changes of}} the Antarctic ice sheet are of {{significant}} interest due to its sensitivity to climatic changes and its contribution to changes in global sea level. While regional climate models successfully estimate mass input due to snowfall, it remains difficult to estimate the amount of mass loss due to ice dynamic processes. It has often been assumed that changes in ice dynamic rates only {{need to be considered}} when assessing long-term ice sheet mass balance; however, 2 decades of satellite altimetry observations reveal that the Antarctic ice <b>sheet</b> <b>changes</b> unexpectedly and much more dynamically than previously expected. Despite available estimates on ice dynamic rates obtained from radar altimetry, information about ice <b>sheet</b> <b>changes</b> due to changes in the ice dynamics are still limited, especially in East Antarctica. Without understanding ice dynamic rates, {{it is not possible to}} properly assess <b>changes</b> in ice <b>sheet</b> mass balance and surface elevation or to develop ice sheet models. In this study we investigate the possibility of estimating ice <b>sheet</b> <b>changes</b> due to ice dynamic rates by removing modelled rates of surface mass balance, firn compaction, and bedrock uplift from satellite altimetry and gravity observations. With similar rates of ice discharge acquired from two different satellite missions we show that it is possible to obtain an approximation of the rate of change due to ice dynamics by combining altimetry and gravity observations. Thus, surface elevation changes due to surface mass balance, firn compaction, and ice dynamic rates can be modelled and correlated with observed elevation changes from satellite altimetry...|$|R

40|$|It is {{acknowledged}} that {{activities such as}} dressing <b>changes</b> and bed <b>sheet</b> <b>changes</b> are high-risk events; creating surges in levels of airborne bacteria. Burns patients are particularly high dispersers of pathogens; due to their large, often contaminated, wound areas. Prevention of nosocomial cross-contamination is therefore {{one of the major}} challenges faced by the burns team. In order to assess the contribution of airborne spread of bacteria, air samples were taken repeatedly throughout and following these events, to quantify levels of airborne bacteria. Air samples were taken at 3 -min intervals before, during and after a dressing and bed change on a burns patient using a sieve impaction method. Following incubation, bacterial colonies were enumerated to calculate bacterial colony forming units per m 3 (cfu/m 3) at each time point. Statistical analysis was performed, whereby the period before the high-risk event took place acted as a control period. The periods during and after the dressing and bed <b>sheet</b> <b>changes</b> were examined for significant differences in airborne bacterial levels relative to the control period. The study was carried out four times, on three patients with burns between 35 % total burn surface area (TBSA) and 51 % TBSA. There were significant increases in airborne bacteria levels, regardless of whether the dressing <b>change</b> or bed <b>sheet</b> <b>change</b> took place first. Of particular note, is the finding that significantly high levels (up to 2614 cfu/m 3) of airborne bacteria were shown to persist for up to approximately 1 h after these activities ended. This is the most accurate picture to date of the rapidly changing levels of airborne bacteria within the room of a burns patient undergoing a dressing change and bed change. The novel demonstration of {{a significant increase in the}} airborne bacterial load during these events has implications for infection control on burns units. Furthermore, as these increased levels remained for approximately 1 h afterwards, persons entering the room both during and after such events may act as vectors of transmission of infection. It is suggested that appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn by anyone entering the room, and that rooms should be quarantined for a period of time following these events...|$|R

40|$|Multilayer thick-film {{technology}} {{is one of}} the important technologies adopted in the miniaturization of electronic systems. Generally, only interconnections are made in the intermediate layers. The possibility of fabricating resistors along with interconnections in the buried layers/intermediate layers using conventional thick-film materials has been examined in this study. The fabrication has been carried out by processing layer after layer. It has been found that the buried layer resistors exhibited a sheet resistivity lower than those fabricated as open resistors. This <b>change</b> in <b>sheet</b> resistivity has been attributed to multiple firings that the resistors undergo during the fabrication. This reduction in sheet resistivity {{has been found to be}} due to segregation of active materials. A model has been proposed to explain this <b>change</b> in <b>sheet</b> resistivity through segregation of the active material. The work reported in the paper clearly indicates that buried resistors with consistent values (+/- 10 %) can be fabricated using conventional materials. However, the design of the resistors has to be carried out using modified sheet resistivities. The model that is proposed also indicates how one can make a paste that is likely to exhibit the same sheet resistivity for buried resistors and open resistors.
