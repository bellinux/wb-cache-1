5|$|MPPS {{suitable}} for oligonucleotide synthesis is a low-swellable, highly <b>cross-linked</b> polystyrene obtained by polymerization of divinylbenzene (min 60%), styrene, and 4-chloromethylstyrene {{in the presence}} of a porogeneous agent. The macroporous chloromethyl MPPS obtained is converted to aminomethyl MPPS.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the ball is its rubber layer; it was {{designed}} to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of <b>cross-linked</b> nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E
5|$|From May to late August 1996 {{the park}} was closed for a $700,000 {{refurbishment}} that included repairs and upgrades to filters and pumps, automated chlorination, restoration of cement, and updating of the lighting system. The fountain was also shut down in 1997 and 1998 for 10 months while the water bureau replaced a 1930s-era pump. The piping was also relined with <b>cross-linked</b> polyethylene {{in the spring of}} spring 2000, a costly operation due to the original piping being cast into the concrete.|$|E
5|$|Hypersensitivity is {{an immune}} {{response}} that damages the body's own tissues. They {{are divided into}} four classes (Type I– IV) based on the mechanisms involved and {{the time course of}} the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when <b>cross-linked</b> by antigen.|$|E
5|$|The current match {{ball for}} the Recopa Sudamericana, {{manufactured}} by Nike, is named the Total 90 Omni CSF. It {{is one of}} the many balls produced by the American sports equipment maker for CONMEBOL, replacing the Mercurial Veloci Hi-Vis in 2009. The ball, approved by FIFA and weighing approximately 422 g, has a spherical shape that allows the ball to fly faster, farther, and more accurately. According to Nike, the ball's geometric precision distributes pressure evenly across panels and around the ball. The compressed polyethylene layer stores energy from impact and releases it at launch, and the 6-wing carbon-latex air chamber improves acceleration. Another feature of the ball is its rubber layer; it was designed to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of <b>cross-linked</b> nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, it {{was found}} that PTFE could be {{radiation}} <b>cross-linked</b> above its melting point in an oxygen-free environment. Electron beam processing is one example of radiation processing. <b>Cross-linked</b> PTFE has improved high-temperature mechanical properties and radiation stability. This was significant because, for many years, irradiation at ambient conditions has been used to break down PTFE for recycling. This radiation-induced chain scission allows it to be more easily reground and reused.|$|E
25|$|Various {{methods can}} used to prepare <b>cross-linked</b> {{polyethylene}} (PE-X) from thermoplastic polyethylene (PE-LD, PE-LLD or PE-HD). By crosslinking low-temperature impact strength, abrasion resistance and environmental stress cracking resistance {{can be increased}} significantly, whereas hardness and rigidity are somewhat reduced. PE-X does not melt anymore (analogous to elastomers) and is thermally resistant (over longer periods of up to 120°C, for short periods without mechanical load up to 250°C). With increasing crosslinking density also the maximum shear modulus increases (even at higher temperatures). PE-X has significantly enhanced properties compared with ordinary PE. As PE-X is infusible, always the final pre-products or the mold part are <b>cross-linked.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nearly all {{polymers}} {{created by}} this method have excellent appearance, are clear, and are significantly <b>cross-linked.</b> Linear polymers are not formed readily by plasma polymerization methods based on propagating species. Many other polymers could be formed by this method.|$|E
25|$|The {{mouth is}} {{equipped}} with a sharp, horny beak mainly made of chitin and <b>cross-linked</b> proteins, and is used to kill and tear prey into manageable pieces. The beak is very robust, but does not contain minerals, unlike the teeth and jaws of many other organisms, including marine species.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, a {{new film}} {{capacitor}} technology that makes use of vacuum-deposited electron-beam <b>cross-linked</b> acrylate materials as dielectric in film capacitors was announced as a patent in the press. But as of 2012, only one manufacturer markets a specific acrylate SMD film capacitor, as an X7R MLCC replacement.|$|E
25|$|Particular {{emphasis}} is placed on a integrated organic management approach looking at the whole Bio farm as <b>cross-linked</b> unit, on the fundamental role and function of agro-ecosystems, on nutrient cycles which are balanced and adapted to the demand of the crops, and on health and welfare of all livestock on the farm.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogels are a {{class of}} {{biomaterials}} that are chemically or physically <b>cross-linked</b> water-soluble polymers. They can be either degradable or non-degradable as determined by their chemistry, but degradable is more desirable whenever possible. There has been great interest in hydrogels for tissue engineering purposes, because they generally possess high biocompatibility, mechanical properties similar to soft tissue, {{and the ability to}} be injected as a liquid that gels. When hydrogels are physically <b>cross-linked</b> they must rely on phase separation for gelation; the phase separation is temperature-dependent and reversible. Some other advantages of hydrogels are that they use only non-toxic aqueous solvents, allow infusion of nutrients and exit of waste products, and allow cells to assemble spontaneously. Hydrogels have low interfacial tension, meaning cells can easily migrate across the tissue-implant boundary. However, with hydrogels it is difficult to form a broad range of mechanical properties or structures with controlled pore size.|$|E
25|$|The {{mouth of}} the squid is {{equipped}} with a sharp horny beak mainly made of <b>cross-linked</b> proteins. It is used to kill and tear prey into manageable pieces. The beak is very robust, but does not contain any minerals, unlike the teeth and jaws of many other organisms, including marine species. The beak is the only indigestible part of the squid.|$|E
25|$|Most LDPE, MDPE, and HDPE grades have {{excellent}} chemical resistance, meaning {{they are not}} attacked by strong acids or strong bases, and are resistant to gentle oxidants and reducing agents. Crystalline samples do not dissolve at room temperature. Polyethylene (other than <b>cross-linked</b> polyethylene) usually can be dissolved at elevated temperatures in aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene or xylene, or in chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethane or trichlorobenzene.|$|E
25|$|Other {{processes}} {{can be used}} {{to obtain}} grease-resistant paper, such as waxing the paper or using fluorine-based chemicals. Highly beating the fibers gives an even more translucent paper with the same grease resistance. Silicone and other coatings may also be applied to the parchment. A silicone-coating treatment produces a <b>cross-linked</b> material with high density, stability and heat resistance and low surface tension which imparts good anti-stick or release properties. Chromium salts {{can also be used to}} impart moderate anti-stick properties.|$|E
25|$|Plasma {{polymerization}} (or {{glow discharge}} polymerization) uses plasma sources {{to generate a}} gas discharge that provides energy to activate or fragment gaseous or liquid monomer, often containing a vinyl group, in order to initiate polymerization. Polymers formed from this technique are generally highly branched and highly <b>cross-linked,</b> and adhere to solid surfaces well. The biggest advantage to this process is that polymers can be directly attached to a desired surface while the chains are growing, which reduces steps necessary for other coating processes such as grafting. This is very useful for pinhole-free coatings of 100 picometers to 1 micrometre thickness with solvent insoluble polymers.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} classes of {{components}} for oxide glasses: network formers, intermediates, and modifiers. The network formers (silicon, boron, germanium) form a highly <b>cross-linked</b> network of chemical bonds. The intermediates (titanium, aluminium, zirconium, beryllium, magnesium, zinc) {{can act as}} both network formers and modifiers, according to the glass composition. The modifiers (calcium, lead, lithium, sodium, potassium) alter the network structure; they are usually present as ions, compensated by nearby non-bridging oxygen atoms, bound by one covalent bond to the glass network and holding one negative charge {{to compensate for the}} positive ion nearby. Some elements can play multiple roles; e.g. lead can act both as a network former (Pb4+ replacing Si4+), or as a modifier.|$|E
25|$|Formaldehyde {{preserves}} or fixes tissue or cells by {{a mixture}} of reversible (short exposure time and low temperatures) and irreversible (long exposure time and higher temperatures) cross-linking of primary amino groups in proteins with other nearby nitrogen atoms in protein or DNA through a -CH2- linkage. This is exploited in ChIP-on-chip or ChIP-sequencing genomics experiments, where DNA-binding proteins are <b>cross-linked</b> to their cognate binding sites on the chromosome and analyzed to determine what genes are regulated by the proteins. Formaldehyde is also used as a denaturing agent in RNA gel electrophoresis, preventing RNA from forming secondary structures. A solution of 4% formaldehyde fixes pathology tissue specimens at about one mm per hour at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|Collagen {{is a major}} {{component}} of the extracellular matrix, and it is found in the supporting tissues of peripheral nerves. A terpolymer (TERP) was synthesized by free radical copolymerization of its three monomers and <b>cross-linked</b> with collagen, creating a hybrid biological-synthetic hydrogel scaffold. The terpolymer is based on poly(NIPAAM), which is known to be a cell friendly polymer. TERP is used both as a cross-linker to increase hydrogel robustness and as a site for grafting of bioactive peptides or growth factors, by reacting some of its acryloxysuccinimide groups with the –NH2 groups on the peptides or growth factors. Because the collagen-terpolymer (collagen-TERP) hydrogel lacks a bioactive component, a study attached to it a common cell adhesion peptide found in laminin (YIGSR) in order to enhance its cell adhesion properties.|$|E
25|$|Liquid ammonia is {{the best-known}} and most widely studied nonaqueous {{ionising}} solvent. Its most conspicuous property {{is its ability}} to dissolve alkali metals to form highly coloured, electrically conductive solutions containing solvated electrons. Apart from these remarkable solutions, much of the chemistry in liquid ammonia can be classified by analogy with related reactions in aqueous solutions. Comparison of the physical properties of NH3 with those of water shows NH3 has the lower melting point, boiling point, density, viscosity, dielectric constant and electrical conductivity; this is due at least in part to the weaker hydrogen bonding in NH3 and because such bonding cannot form <b>cross-linked</b> networks, since each NH3 molecule has only one lone pair of electrons compared with two for each H2O molecule. The ionic self-dissociation constant of liquid NH3 at −50°C is about 10−33 mol2·l−2.|$|E
25|$|Regarding the {{organization}} of covalent bonds, recall that classic molecular solids, as stated above, consist of small, non-polar covalent molecules. The example given, paraffin wax, {{is a member of}} a family of hydrocarbon molecules of differing chain lengths, with high-density polyethylene at the long-chain end of the series. High-density polyethylene can be a strong material: when the hydrocarbon chains are well aligned, the resulting fibers rival the strength of steel. The covalent bonds in this material form extended structures, but do not form a continuous network. With cross-linking, however, polymer networks can become continuous, and a series of materials spans the range from <b>Cross-linked</b> polyethylene, to rigid thermosetting resins, to hydrogen-rich amorphous solids, to vitreous carbon, diamond-like carbons, and ultimately to diamond itself. As this example shows, there can be no sharp boundary between molecular and network covalent solids.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{structural}} proteins (1-5%) {{are found}} in most plant cell walls; they are classified as hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGP), arabinogalactan proteins (AGP), glycine-rich proteins (GRPs), and proline-rich proteins (PRPs). Each class of glycoprotein is defined by a characteristic, highly repetitive protein sequence. Most are glycosylated, contain hydroxyproline (Hyp) and become <b>cross-linked</b> in the cell wall. These proteins are often concentrated in specialized cells and in cell corners. Cell walls of the epidermis may contain cutin. The Casparian strip in the endodermis roots and cork cells of plant bark contain suberin. Both cutin and suberin are polyesters that function as permeability barriers to the movement of water. The relative composition of carbohydrates, secondary compounds and proteins varies between plants and between the cell type and age. Plant cells walls also contain numerous enzymes, such as hydrolases, esterases, peroxidases, and transglycosylases, that cut, trim and cross-link wall polymers.|$|E
25|$|Polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels are {{biocompatible}} and {{proven to}} be tolerated in many tissue types, including the CNS. Mahoney and Anseth formed PEG hydrogels by photopolymerizing methacrylate groups covalently linked to degradable PEG macromers. Hydrogel degradation was monitored over time by measuring mechanical strength (compressive modulus) and average mesh size from swelling ratio data. Initially, the polymer chains were highly <b>cross-linked,</b> but as degradation proceeded, ester bonds were hydrolyzed, allowing the gel to swell; the compressive modulus decreased as the mesh size increased until the hydrogel was completely dissolved. It was demonstrated that neural precursor cells were able to be photoencapsulated and cultured on the PEG gels with minimal cell death. Because the mesh size is initially small, the hydrogel blocks inflammatory and other inhibitory signals from surrounding tissue. As the mesh size increases, the hydrogel is able {{to serve as a}} scaffold for axon regeneration.|$|E
25|$|Dextran is a {{polysaccharide}} {{derived from}} bacteria; {{it is usually}} produced by enzymes from certain strains of leuconostoc or Streptococcus. It consists of α-1,6-linked D-glucopyranose residues. <b>Cross-linked</b> dextran hydrogel beads {{have been widely used}} as low protein-binding matrices for column chromatography applications and for microcarrier cell culture technology. However, it has not been until recently that dextran hydrogels have been investigated in biomaterials applications and specifically as drug delivery vehicles. An advantage of using dextran in biomaterials applications include its resistance to protein adsorption and cell-adhesion, which allows specific cell adhesion to be determined by deliberately attached peptides from ECM components. AEMA was copolymerized with Dex-MA in order to introduce primary amine groups to provide a site for attachment of ECM-derived peptides to promote cell adhesion. The peptides can be immobilized using sulfo-SMMC coupling chemistry and cysteine-terminated peptides. Copolymerization of Dex-MA with AEMA allowed the macroporous geometry of the scaffolds to be preserved in addition to promoting cellular interactions.|$|E
25|$|Alginate is a {{polysaccharide}} that readily forms chains; {{it can be}} <b>cross-linked</b> at its carboxylic {{groups with}} multivalent cations such as Cu2+, Ca2+, or Al3+ to form a more mechanically stable hydrogel. Calcium alginates form polymers that are both biocompatible and non-immunogenic and {{have been used in}} tissue engineering applications. However, they are unable to support longitudinally oriented growth, which is necessary for reconnection of the proximal end with its target. In order to overcome this problem, anisotropic capillary hydrogels (ACH) have been developed. They are created by superimposing aqueous solutions of sodium alginate with aqueous solutions of multivalent cations in layers. After formation, the electrolyte ions diffuse into the polymer solution layers, and a dissipative convective process causes the ions to precipitate, creating capillaries. The dissipative convective process results the opposition of diffusion gradients and friction between the polyelectrolyte chains. The capillary walls are lined with the precipitated metal alginate, while the lumen is filled with the extruded water.|$|E
25|$|Reversible addition-fragmentation chain {{transfer}} or RAFT polymerization {{is one of}} several kinds of reversible-deactivation radical polymerization. It makes use of a {{chain transfer}} agent {{in the form of a}} thiocarbonylthio compound (or similar, from here on referred to as a RAFT agent, see Figure 1) to afford control over the generated molecular weight and polydispersity during a free-radical polymerization. Discovered at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) of Australia in 1998, RAFT polymerization {{is one of several}} living or controlled radical polymerization techniques, others being atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP), etc. RAFT polymerization uses thiocarbonylthio compounds, such as dithioesters, thiocarbamates, and xanthates, to mediate the polymerization via a reversible chain-transfer process. As with other controlled radical polymerization techniques, RAFT polymerizations can be performed with conditions to favor low dispersity (molecular weight distribution) and a pre-chosen molecular weight. RAFT polymerization can be used to design polymers of complex architectures, such as linear block copolymers, comb-like, star, brush polymers, dendrimers and <b>cross-linked</b> networks.|$|E
25|$|Self-assembled vesicles are {{essential}} components of primitive cells. The second law of thermodynamics {{requires that the}} Universe move in a direction in which entropy increases, yet life is distinguished by its great degree of organization. Therefore, a boundary is needed to separate life processes from non-living matter. Researchers Irene A. Chen and Jack W. Szostak amongst others, suggest that simple physicochemical properties of elementary protocells can give rise to essential cellular behaviours, including primitive forms of differential reproduction competition and energy storage. Such cooperative interactions between the membrane and its encapsulated contents could greatly simplify the transition from simple replicating molecules to true cells. Furthermore, competition for membrane molecules would favour stabilized membranes, suggesting a selective advantage {{for the evolution of}} <b>cross-linked</b> fatty acids and even the phospholipids of today. Such micro-encapsulation would allow for metabolism within the membrane, the exchange of small molecules but the prevention of passage of large substances across it. The main advantages of encapsulation include the increased solubility of the contained cargo within the capsule and the storage of energy {{in the form of a}} electrochemical gradient.|$|E
500|$|The mRNA {{does not}} contain all the {{information}} for specifying {{the nature of the}} mature protein. The nascent polypeptide chain released from the ribosome commonly requires additional processing before the final product emerges. For one thing, the correct folding process is complex and vitally important. For most proteins it requires other chaperone proteins to control the form of the product. Some proteins then excise internal segments from their own peptide chains, splicing the free ends that border the gap; in such processes the inside [...] "discarded" [...] sections are called inteins. [...] Other proteins must be split into multiple sections without splicing. Some polypeptide chains need to be <b>cross-linked,</b> and others must be attached to cofactors such as haem (heme) before they become functional.|$|E
500|$|In most bacteria, a {{cell wall}} is {{present on the}} outside of the cell {{membrane}}. The cell membrane and cell wall comprise the cell envelope. A common bacterial cell wall material is peptidoglycan (called [...] "murein" [...] in older sources), which is made from polysaccharide chains <b>cross-linked</b> by peptides containing D-amino acids. Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of plants and fungi, which are made of cellulose and chitin, respectively. The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan. The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria, and the antibiotic penicillin is able to kill bacteria by inhibiting a step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan. The cell wall is absent in L-form bacteria. The main pathogenic types are some species of Mycoplasma.|$|E
2500|$|Aerogel {{structure}} {{results from}} a sol-gel polymerization, which is when monomers (simple molecules) react with other monomers to form a sol or a substance that consists of bonded, <b>cross-linked</b> macromolecules with deposits of liquid solution between them. [...] When the material is critically heated the liquid is evaporated out and the bonded, <b>cross-linked</b> macromolecule frame is left behind. [...] The result of the polymerization and critical heating {{is the creation of}} a material that has a porous strong structure classified as aerogel. Variations in synthesis can alter the surface area and pore size of the aerogel. The smaller the pore size the more suceptible the aerogel is to fracture.|$|E
2500|$|... 2-Vinylpyridine {{is readily}} {{polymerized}} or copolymerized with styrene, butadiene, isobutylene, methyl methacrylate, and other compounds {{in the presence}} of radical, cationic, or anionic initiators.

2500|$|In {{trying to}} uncover the {{intermediate}} stages of abiogenesis mentioned by Bernal, Sidney W. Fox in the 1950s and 1960s studied the spontaneous formation of peptide structures (small chains of amino acids) under conditions that might plausibly have existed early in Earth's history. In one of his experiments, he allowed amino acids to dry out as if puddled in a warm, dry spot in prebiotic conditions. He found that, as they dried, the amino acids formed long, often <b>cross-linked,</b> thread-like, submicroscopic polypeptide molecules now named [...] "proteinoid microspheres." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cuprene {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} reported acetylene polymers. Its highly <b>cross-linked</b> nature led to no further studies in the field for quite some time. [...] Linear polyacetylene was first prepared by Giulio Natta in 1958. [...] The resulting polyacetylene was linear, of high molecular weight, displayed high crystallinity, and had a regular structure. X-ray diffraction studies demonstrated that the resulting polyacetylene was trans-polyacetylene. [...] After this first reported synthesis, few chemists were interested in polyacetylene because the product of Natta’s preparation was an insoluble, air sensitive, and infusible black powder.|$|E
2500|$|General Willoughby {{continued}} {{to believe that}} the Japanese only intended to build airfields on the northern coast with the intent to attack Port Moresby and Australia by air. But the Japanese fought up the northern side of the Owen Stanley Mountains {{and in the middle of}} September, after weeks of fighting, descended the southern slopes to Ioribaiwa Ridge, within [...] of Port Moresby. At the peak of their effort, the Japanese had 16,000 troops in the region. Japanese engineers remained on the coast to fortify the beachhead and build a system of reinforced and <b>cross-linked</b> bunkers.|$|E
2500|$|Because of its {{chemical}} inertness, PTFE {{cannot be}} <b>cross-linked</b> like an elastomer. Therefore, {{it has no}} [...] "memory" [...] and is subject to creep. Because of its superior chemical and thermal properties, PTFE is often used as a gasket material within industries that require resistance to aggressive chemicals such as pharmaceuticals or chemical processing. However, because of the propensity to creep, the long-term performance of such seals is worse than for elastomers which exhibit zero, or near-zero, levels of creep. In critical applications, Belleville washers are often used to apply continuous force to PTFE gaskets, ensuring a minimal loss of performance over the lifetime of the gasket.|$|E
2500|$|As2S3 occurs both in {{crystalline}} and amorphous forms. [...] Both forms feature polymeric structures {{consisting of}} [...] trigonal pyramidal As(III) centres linked by sulfide centres. [...] The sulfide centres are two-fold coordinated to two arsenic atoms. [...] In the crystalline form, the compound adopts a ruffled sheet structure. [...] The bonding {{between the sheets}} consists of van der Waals forces. [...] The crystalline form is usually found in geological samples. Amorphous As2S3 does not possess a layered structure but is more highly <b>cross-linked.</b> [...] Like other glasses, there is no medium or long-range order, but the first co-ordination sphere is well defined.
