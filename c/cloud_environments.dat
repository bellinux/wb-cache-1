Efficient predicting tasks execution time is {{a key component of}} successful tasks scheduling and resource allocation in <b>Cloud</b> Computing <b>Environment.</b> In this paper, we propose a framework for supporting knowledge discovery application running in <b>cloud</b> <b>environment</b> as well as a holistic approach to predict the application execution times. We use rough sets theory to determine a reduct and then compute the execution time prediction. The heuristic reduct algorithm is based on frequencies of attributes appeared in discernibility matrix. We also propose to add dynamic information about the performances of various knowledge discovery tools over specific data sources to the <b>Cloud</b> Computing <b>Environment</b> for supporting the prediction. This information can be added as additional metadata stored in <b>Cloud</b> <b>environment.</b> Experimental result validates our solution that rough sets provide a formal framework for the problem of application execution time prediction in <b>Cloud</b> <b>environment...</b>|$|R
40|$|Distributed {{simulation}} over <b>Cloud</b> <b>environment</b> {{is still}} a new subject. Cloud computing is expected to bring new benefits to conventional distributed simulation, including elasticity on computation resource, cost saving on investment and convenience on service accessibility. A few researches have been done on applying Cloud computing on distributed simulation. However, there are various drawbacks and limitations on those works. Lack of interoperability across Cloud platforms is one of critical drawbacks among them. It can greatly limit the usability and flexibility of distributed simulation over <b>Cloud</b> <b>environment.</b> Based on the investigation on Cloud computing and existing distributed simulation systems over <b>Cloud</b> <b>environment,</b> a novel interoperable HLA-based (High Level Architecture) simulation system over a <b>Cloud</b> <b>environment,</b> ISSC (Interoperable Simulation System over a <b>Cloud</b> <b>Environment),</b> is proposed in this thesis. ISSC aims to address the interoperability issue of simulation system across various Cloud platforms. It employs OCCI {{and a set of}} technologies, including Ruby on Rails, OpenVPN and RESTful web services, to build the interoperability across Cloud platforms. It adopts a distributed architecture to construct flexibility and expansibility of the system. The prototype and related experiments performed provides an excellent demonstration that ISSC is a reliable and effective solution on interoperable simulation system over a diverse <b>Cloud</b> <b>environment...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractCloud {{environment}} is mainly used to store and analyze {{large volumes of}} data. The major benefits of hosting the applications using <b>cloud</b> <b>environment</b> are storing large volume of data and performing live data analytics. Cloud systems have switches, which serves as an interface connecting and sharing the data with each other. Network bandwidth congestion is caused when large volumes of data are moved to node or cluster in the <b>cloud</b> <b>environment</b> which in- turn creates Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation for the cloud application service. The result of SLA violation includes impact on working of the entire cloud service. The proposed Network Bandwidth Congestion Prediction framework (NBCPF) predicts the bandwidth congestion using weighted random early detection, to avoids the SLA violation for applications services. NBCPF arrests the bandwidth congestion in <b>cloud</b> <b>environment</b> by prediction of switches in <b>cloud</b> <b>environment</b> resulting in accurately identifying the exact task involved in creation of jobs or services...|$|R
