5|$|Battle Mountain <b>changed</b> <b>hands</b> {{so often}} during August {{that there is}} no {{agreement}} on the exact number of times. The intelligence sergeant of the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry estimated the peak <b>changed</b> <b>hands</b> 19 times. From August 18 {{to the end of the}} month, North Korean troops attacked the mountain every night. The peak often <b>changed</b> <b>hands</b> two or three times in a 24-hour period. The usual pattern was for the North Koreans to take it at night and the US 24th Infantry to recapture it the next day. This type of fluctuating battle resulted in relatively high losses among artillery forward observers and their equipment. During the period of August 15–31, seven forward observers and eight other members of the Observer and Liaison Section of the 159th Field Artillery Battalion were casualties, and they lost eight radios, 11 telephones, and two vehicles in the process.|$|E
