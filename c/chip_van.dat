2500|$|Presented as Davey's Fried Fish & Chip Potato Restaurant, {{the fish}} and chip shop opened in 2011, and {{represents}} the typical style of shop found in the era as they were becoming rapidly popular in the region - the brick built Victorian style fryery would most often have previously been used for another trade, and the attached corrugated iron hut serves as a saloon with tables and benches, where customers would eat and socialise. Featuring coal fired ranges using beef-dripping, the shop is named [...] in honour of the last coal fired shop in Tyneside, located in Winlaton Mill, and which closed in 2007. Latterly run by brothers Brian and Ramsay Davy, it had been established by their grandfather in 1937. The serving counter {{and one of the}} shop's three fryers, a 1934 Nuttal, came from the original Davy shop. The other two fryers are a 1920s Mabbott used near Chester until the 1960s, and a GW Atkinson New Castle Range, donated from a shop in Prudhoe in 1973. The latter is one of only two known late Victorian examples to survive. The decorative wall tiles in the fryery came to the museum in 1979 from Cowes Fish and Game Shop in Berwick upon Tweed. The shop also features both an early electric and hand-powered potato rumblers (cleaners), and a gas powered chip chopper built around 1900. Built behind the chapel, the fryery is arranged so the counter faces the rear, stretching the full length of the building. Outside is a brick built row of outdoor toilets.

40|$|Forest Concepts {{is working}} under a federal {{contract}} from the USDA CSREES SBIR program to develop better methods to collect and transport woody biomass collected from small-scale fuels reduction projects (ranging from residential lots to 20 acre parcels) in the true wildland-urban intermix zone (WUI). Our specific objective is to enable more of the material to be delivered to value-added uses including energy, biorefineries, and engineered wood products. A secondary objective is to enable diversion of urban greenwood from landfills and compost facilities. Our {{solution to the problem}} is to develop baling equipment and technology that enable woody biomass to be baled for transport on standard flatbed trucks, rail, and barge. The driving assumption behind our project is that baled biomass a) preserves user values as compared to on-site chipping, and b) facilitates delivery to more distant users than can be economically reached by <b>chip</b> <b>vans</b> or bulk bins. Another consideration for urban and suburban sources is that baling within residential areas produces lower noise, lower dust (and aerosols), and is potentially safer than chipping. We have designed and tested a baler that is a mid-size unit to demonstrate the concepts for equipment, on-site operations, and baled-material distribution logistics. Smaller and larger balers will be defined as appropriate for other markets...|$|R

[...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Forestry, 2010 Three {{separate}} {{forest biomass}} harvesting systems {{were selected to}} study the operational performance and costs of systems designed to recover sawlog harvesting residues and silviculturally restore forests through stand conversion operations. These systems {{include the use of}} hook-lift trucks to access remote forest residues, energy wood harvesters to collect and improve density of residues through bundling, and integrated operations for the production of both sawlogs and energy wood chips. The overall system productivities were significantly affected by adverse road hauling distances, slash pile material size and arrangement, diesel fuel prices, and appropriate pairings of machinery. Slash pile arrangement and material size were found to {{have a significant effect on}} productivity of loading loose slash into trucks and in the bundling of slash. Forest biomass that was not accessible using traditional highway <b>chip</b> <b>vans</b> was successfully removed from previously harvested timber sites with hook-lift trucks. Energy wood harvesters were effective in collecting and compressing slash into bundles, and can be successfully incorporated into centralized grinding operations. Integrated harvesting of both sawlogs and biomass was a good method for silviculturally restoring stands and to produce both high value sawlogs and energy wood chips. Total system costs ranged from $ 32. 98 /bone dry ton (BDT) for residue recovery operations including a hook-lift truck to $ 46. 50 /BDT for bundling operations.

Limbs and foliage are left on site. So far, there have only been limited trials with other equipment. The Canadian NRCC/HYD-Mech FB- 7 * and FB- 12 continuous-travel feller/buncher heads were tested in short rotation plantations. The FB- 7 worked well. but with trees much smaller than those currently being grown for pulp. The FB- 12, attached to an old carrier with poor hydraulics, was not veq productive with larger trees. The head appeared to have inherent deficiencies, the main one being the accumulation approach: holding trees vertically but loosely. This tended to put overturning moments on the machine and limited the sizes of the bunches that could be built.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 The {{transportation}} {{of wood and}} biomass resources from landing and other collection locations to processing and distribution sites is a substantial cost within the wood supply chain. These high costs {{provide a basis for}} research aimed at improving biomass transportation planning decisions and potentially reducing biomass transportation costs. Chip vans have been identified to be the most cost-efficient mode of transporting biomass provided the roads are suitable for the trucks which are generally built for highway use. Research to develop <b>chip</b> <b>van</b> performance simulation models for travel time prediction could potentially reduce biomass transportation costs by improving transportation planning decisions. GPS technology has the ability to record information such as location (longitude, latitude and elevation), movement (speed, heading) and travel time which makes it an attractive tool for data collection to develop, test and validate vehicle simulation models. In spite of several studies investigating the accuracy and performance of GPS under different forest conditions, the reliability of GPS receiver measurements for moving vehicles under forest canopy and in mountainous terrain has not been examined. This dissertation includes two manuscripts. One manuscript presents a <b>Chip</b> <b>Van</b> Travel Time Prediction Simulation Model (CHIP-VAN) that was developed using data collected by GPS receivers to track and monitor chip vans. The vans were exclusively used for transporting chipped (ground) biomass from forest operation sites in western Oregon. The other manuscript examines the accuracy and reliability of GPS for vehicle tracking under different forest canopy conditions and mountainous terrain. The model, CHIP-VAN, is developed based on the maximum limiting speeds on each road segment as limited by road grade, stopping sight distance (SSD) and road alignment as well as modeling the driver's behavior as these road conditions change. A two pass simulation was used in the model; the first pass simulation calculates the maximum limiting speeds on each road segment and the second pass simulates the driver's behavior and calculates the travel time. To emulate the driver's behavior, four cases that determine whether a driver will accelerate, decelerate or continue at current speed, were developed. The model has been tested for validation using the data collected for the study. The validation tests suggest that the model is appropriate for predicting travel time for chip vans on single lane forest roads with acceptable accuracy. The findings in the second study demonstrate that the GPS tracking accuracy of vehicles on forested roads are clearly influenced by the composition of the surrounding canopy, with the strongest influence being from heavy forest canopy cover. Accuracy is generally improved in areas with less forest canopy. The study concludes that the consumer-grade GPS receiver measurements determined are acceptable for tracking and improving biomass transport from forest supply locations to distribution and processing centers. The analysis of the range of accuracies found for vehicles operating within heavy forest canopy cover demonstrates that the accuracies are probably acceptable for many forest transportation monitoring and planning applications, including the mapping of forest road locations and other forest transportation operations. It is expected that the CHIP-VAN model and GPS accuracy studies will aid forest transportation managers in decision making and transportation planning in biomass operations. Most importantly it is hoped that the results of this research will increase transportation management planning efficiency for biomass and lead to improved methods for developing biomass cost assessment...|$|E
40|$|To {{meet the}} 'Twenty in Ten Initiative' goals {{set in the}} 2007 State of the Union address, forest {{resources}} will be needed as feedstocks for lignocellulosic ethanol production. It {{has been estimated that}} 368 million dry tons can be produced annually in the U. S. from logging residues and fuel treatment thinnings. Currently, very little of this woody biomass is used for energy production due to the costs and difficulty in collecting and transporting this material. However, minimizing biomass costs (including harvest, handling, transport, storage, and processing costs) delivered to the refinery is necessary to develop a sustainable cellulosic ethanol industry. Achieving this goal requires a fresh look at conventional timber harvesting operations to identify ways of efficiently integrating energy wood collection and developing cost-effective technologies to harvest small-diameter trees. In conventional whole-tree logging operations, entire trees are felled and skidded from the stump to the landing. The residues (also called slash), consisting of tops and limbs, accumulate at the landing when trees are delimbed. This slash can be ground at the landing with a mobile grinder or transported to another central location with a stationary grinder. The ground material is transported via chip vans, or possibly large roll on/off containers, to the user facility. Cut-to-length harvesting systems are gaining popularity in some locations. In these operations, specialized harvesters that can fall, delimb, and cut logs to length are used. The small diameter tops and limbs accumulate along the machine's track. It can be left in the forest to dry or removed soon after harvest while logs are extracted. Removing slash during the same operation as the wood {{has been shown to be}} more efficient. However, leaving residue in the forest to dry reduces moisture content, which improves grinder performance, reduces dry matter loss during storage, and inhibits colonization of fungi that produce harmful spores. In recent years, new machines that are specially designed for collection of small diameter wood have been developed in the U. S. and Europe. Residue bundlers and balers improve transportation and handling efficiency by densifying the material and packaging it so that it can be handled with conventional equipment. An experimental integrated harvester/grinder can fall small diameter trees and feed them into a grinder. The ground material is collected in a bin that can be dumped into a <b>chip</b> <b>van.</b> The harvester head is also capable of delimbing and bucking (cut into sections) small timber to be used for pulp and posts. Limitations of these new technologies are their large capital costs and complexity, leading to high maintenance costs and the need for highly trained operators. To ensure that quality feedstock materials consistently enter the mouth of the refinery, the uniform format supply system concept proposes that feedstock diversity be managed at harvest, much like the current grain supply system. This allows for standardization of key infrastructure components and facilitation of a biomass commodity system. Challenges in achieving a uniform woody biomass supply include, but are not limited to, developing machines for efficient harvest of small-diameter trees in a range of topographies and conditions, developing machines and operating plans for grinding biomass as near to the stump as possible, developing cost-effective drying strategies to reduce losses and mold growth during wood chip storage, and quantifying environmental impacts of slash removal and fuel thinnings to aid landowner decisions and policy development...|$|E
