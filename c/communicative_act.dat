The analysis {{carried out in the}} INCLuD-ED project identified that {{one of the keys to}} this success was the continuous replacement of power-related <b>communicative</b> <b>acts,</b> which are typical of traditional classrooms, with dialogic <b>communicative</b> <b>acts.</b> The power-related <b>communicative</b> <b>acts,</b> which affect students or excluded from ordinary classrooms or placed in compensatory education classes or removed from mainstream areas of other forms of educational segregation, are transformed into dialogic <b>communicative</b> <b>acts</b> in groups based on egalitarian dialogue (which involves the conditions Of sincerity and consensus). This article develops the provious argument through an in-depth analysis of educational actions linked to school failure and based on power-related <b>communicative</b> <b>acts,</b> in which there is a predominance of power-related interaction.

Consequently, the greater impact on an improvement in educational outcomes can be achieved using this form of organization.

The main purpose of this pilot was to identify and describe developmentally different features of children’s <b>communicative</b> <b>acts</b> in relation to mothers’ <b>communicative</b> <b>acts.</b> Ten children, of ages ranging from 11 months to 28 months and their mothers, participated in this pilot. Each mother / child dyad was observed in the two semi-structured contexts of joint book reading and toy play. The joint book reading refers to the activities where the dyads interacted with picture books and toy play refers to the activities where they interacted with given toys. Analyses were made of both mothers’ and children’s <b>communicative</b> <b>acts</b> including both gestural and speech activity, using an existing coding system called the Inventory of Communicative Acts-Abridged (INCA-A) with an additional supplemental coding system. The results indicate that the adopted coding system seemed to capture developmentally different features of <b>communicative</b> <b>acts</b> in terms of quantity and quality.

This study used a single subject ABC design {{to determine if}} a peer-buddy social skills intervention based on buddy skills would increase the frequency and quality of interaction between three preschool-aged children with social communication disorders and three typically-developing peers, in a public school setting.

Videotaped observations were analyzed for frequency of <b>communicative</b> <b>acts,</b> modes of communication, diversity of vocabulary, structural complexity of sentences, initiation, reciprocity, and duration of interaction. Sociometric ranking and social validation ratings were also obtained. All target children increased frequency of <b>communicative</b> <b>acts</b> directed toward typically-developing peer buddies, use of multiple modes of communication; and reciprocal <b>communicative</b> <b>acts.</b> There was no change in vocabulary or length of utterances.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} a communication layer, fitted to simulate incomplete information exchange among software agents inhabiting a simulation environment. The communication layer {{is designed to}} ensure simulation repeatability at the message exchange level. Message exchange impact on repeatability is found to have some addressable open issues within RoboCup-Rescue simulation environment’s present stage. The RoboCup-Rescue simulation environment architectural model is considered. This model considers multiple heterogeneous software agents and several domain specific aspect simulators. In this model, a set of <b>communicative</b> <b>acts</b> sustains all inter-agent information exchange as well as agent-world acting and sensing capabilities. RoboCup-Rescue <b>communicative</b> <b>acts</b> are classified from the simulation repeatability perspective. It is assumed that agent’s information exchange model, follows a connectionless simple request-reply communication pattern. A reliable UDP-based protocol, less resource demanding than TCP, is proposed. Incomplete information exchange {{is regarded as a}} nonfunctional facet. Knowledge of the environment <b>communicative</b> <b>acts</b> is introduced at the communication layer, so that application level independency is achieved on that nonfunctional facet. The paper describes the experiments and presents the results that validate the proposal of an UDP-based reliable protocol. The RoboCup-Rescue simulation environment is used to materialize and analyze the proposed classification of <b>communicative</b> <b>acts.</b> ...|$|R

The intended meaning of the author can be discerned to a certain degree from the text. The text (langue and parole) is not an arbitrary [...] "playground" [...] but part of a covenantal relationship between all people. As a result, the intention of the author can be adequately decoded. Another consequence is that the reader/interpreter has a responsibility to honor the intentions of the author and try to interpret the text in a way which re-creates the author's intended meaning. This responsibility is coupled with a freedom to determine the significance {{in the context of the}} interpreter's community.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} the relationship among age, first- and second-order Theory of Mind and the increasing ability of children to understand and produce different kinds of <b>communicative</b> <b>acts</b> – sincere, ironic, and deceitful <b>communicative</b> <b>acts</b> – expressed through linguistic and extralinguistic expressive means. To communicate means to modify an interlocutor’s mental states (Grice, 1989), and pragmatics studies the inferential processes that are necessary to fill the gap, which often exists in human communication, between the literal meaning of a speaker’s utterance and what the speaker intends to communicate to the interlocutor. We administered brief video-clip stories showing different kinds of pragmatic phenomena – sincere, ironic, and deceitful <b>communicative</b> <b>acts</b> - and first- and second-order ToM tasks, to 120 children, ranging in age from 3 to 8 years. The results showed the existence of a trend of difficulty in children’s ability to deal with both linguistic and extralinguistic pragmatic tasks, from the simplest to the most difficult: sincere, deceitful, and ironic <b>communicative</b> <b>acts.</b> A hierarchical regression analysis indicated that age plays a significant role in explaining children’s performance on each pragmatic task. Furthermore, the hierarchical regression analysis revealed that first-order ToM has a causal role in explaining children’s performance in handling sincere and deceitful speech acts, but not irony. We did not detect any specific role for second-order ToM. Finally, ToM only partially explains the observed increasing trend of difficulty in children’s pragmatic performance: the variance in pragmatic performance explained by ToM increases between sincere and deceitful <b>communicative</b> <b>acts,</b> but not between deceit and irony. The role of inferential ability in explaining the improvement in children’s performance across the pragmatic tasks investigated is discussed...|$|R
5000|$|According to Eichenbaum, Shklovsky was {{the lead}} critic of the group, and Shklovsky contributed two of their most {{well-known}} concepts: defamiliarization (ostraneniye, more literally, 'estrangement') and the plot/story distinction (syuzhet/fabula).

Innovation in literary history is, according to Shklovsky, partly a matter of finding new techniques of defamiliarization. The plot/story distinction separates out the sequence of events the work relates (the story) from the sequence in which those events are presented in the work (the plot). Both of these concepts are attempts to describe the significance of the form of a literary work in order to define its [...] "literariness." [...] For the Russian Formalists as a whole, form is what makes something art to begin with, so in order to understand a work of art as a work of art (rather than as an ornamented <b>communicative</b> <b>act)</b> one must focus on its form.|$|E

40|$|Speech acts {{in natural}} anguage dialogues can be {{regarded}} as intentional acts performed by a dialogue participant to influence the relevant aspects of the mental state of a recipient. In this paper, a framework is discussed for deriving the beliefs and intentions of a speaker from a certain speech act.
