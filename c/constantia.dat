5|$|Henry Hare (1635–1708) {{settled at}} the Lordship House, {{renaming}} it Bruce Castle {{in honour of}} the area's historic connection with the House of Bruce. Hare was a noted historian {{and author of the}} first history of Tottenham. He grew up at the Hare family house at Totteridge, and it is not known when he moved to Tottenham. At the time of the birth of his first child, Hugh, in 1668, the family were still living in Totteridge, while {{by the time of the}} death of his first wife <b>Constantia,</b> in 1680, the family were living in Bruce Castle. According to Hare, <b>Constantia</b> was buried in All Hallows Church in Tottenham. However, the parish register for the period is complete and makes no mention of her death or burial.|$|E
5|$|Aalborg's {{old city}} hall in Gammeltorv, in service until 1912, {{was built in}} 1762. It is now only used for {{ceremonial}} and representative purposes. Designed in the Late Baroque style, the building with its black-glazed tile roof consists of two storeys and a cellar. The yellow-washed façade is decorated with white pilasters and a frontispiece featuring the Danish coat of arms and a bust of King Frederick V. His motto, Prudentia et <b>Constantia,</b> is also seen above the main entrance. The well-preserved door {{is an example of}} the Rococo style. The building was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency in 1918.|$|E

5|$|In 580, Hormizd IV {{abolished}} the Caucasian Iberian monarchy, and turned Iberia into a Persian province {{ruled by a}} marzpan (governor). During the 580s, the war continued inconclusively with victories on both sides. In 582, Maurice won a battle at <b>Constantia</b> over Adarmahan and Tamkhusro, who was killed, but the Roman general did not follow up his victory; he had to hurry to Constantinople to pursue his imperial ambitions. Another Roman victory at Solachon in 586 likewise failed to break the stalemate.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all {{the most}} notable sweet Muscats of Greece, {{particularly}} those from the island of Samos {{and the city of}} Patras on the Peloponnese are made from Muscat blanc à Petits Grains. In the history of South African wine, the famous dessert wine of <b>Constantia</b> was made from this variety of Muscat and while today Muscat of Alexandria is more widely planted in South Africa, producers around <b>Constantia</b> are trying to reclaim some of the region's viticultural acclaim by replanting more Muscat blanc à Petits Grains and making wines {{in the style of the}} original <b>Constantia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Throughout the Cape, van der Stel {{set high}} {{standards}} for wine production. He issued official decrees that imposed a high penalty on growers harvesting grapes {{before they were}} ripe or fermenting wine in dirty barrels. Van der Stel's dedication to quality soon garnered the wines of <b>Constantia</b> – and by association the Cape – a reputation for quality across Europe. Wine expert Hugh Johnson has described <b>Constantia</b> as the first New World wine to enjoy international acclaim. The early tasting notes from Batavia in 1692 remarked that the Cape wines of <b>Constantia</b> were the highest quality that had ever been exported there. In his 1705 work, Description of the Cape of Good Hope, the Dutch writer Françcois Valentijn noted that the red wines of <b>Constantia</b> {{were on the same}} scale of quality as the best Persian wines or Lachryma Christi from Italy. He also went on to praise the quality of the Chenin blanc Steenwyn produced at the estate.|$|E
40|$|Faecal samples {{collected}} from 300 Bolivian marsupials (Didelphimorphia: Didelphidae) between 1984 and 1993 were examined for coccidian parasites. Sporulated oocysts {{were present in}} the faeces of 50 (17 %) marsupials representing 11 genera and 22 species. Three new species of Eimeria are described and named from six host species. One species occurred in Marmosops dorothea, Monodelphis domestica and Thylamys venustus, another in Micoureus <b>constantiae</b> <b>constantiae</b> and Micoureus <b>constantiae</b> budini and a third in Marmosops dorothea. A discriminant analysis performed on five quantitative oocyst measurements revealed similarities between the first and third Eimeria species because of similar sizes and shapes of the oocysts, whereas the second Eimeria species was structurally discrete. The Eimeria that infects multiple hosts may be a common widespread species. Future surveys are advised for a thorough assessment of the coccidian biodiversity within Bolivian marsupials...|$|R

50|$|The first {{mention of}} a church in Konstanz {{dedicated}} to the Virgin Mary was in 615.

50|$|In {{this early}} Tudor period the modest manor very {{occasionally}} hosted hunting parties to King Henry VIII {{being in the}} then intact, and now partially remaining Weald, an expansive woodland. Bray mortgaged the property to John Reade of Sterborough who transferred this debt to Sir George More of Loseley. As {{the wealth of the}} elite grew but before the heyday of the British Empire, the Elizabethan architecture manor house was built by More, on taking possession in 1587, using his wife, <b>Constantia's</b> money. His heirs exchanged this with Witley whose main manor belonged to Sir Francis Woolley of Pirford (now Pyrford), his nephew.|$|R

Additionally, under apartheid, Coloured people received educations inferior to that of Whites. It was, however, better than that provided to Black South Africans.|$|E

25|$|<b>Constantia's</b> {{poems are}} few and far between, yet the ones still in {{circulation}} are seen as proof of her intelligence. Many poems, epigrams, and occasional pieces flowed from her facile pen—written in Latin, Greek, or English; but as they did not come up to her standard of excellence, she burnt them all before her death. None of her poems have been preserved, save a few which she addressed to various friends, notably to Mrs. Barber, and which are too personal to be quoted as they could not possess any interest for the general reader; and, on the other hand, it would be unfair to give them as specimens of Mrs. Grierson's poetical abilities.|$|R

500|$|Since {{the end of}} apartheid, the South African wine {{industry}} has been working to reestablish itself in the world's wine markets with many regions actively promoting their Cabernet Sauvignon.

25|$|When the Romans {{breached}} {{the treaty}} in 440, Attila and Bleda attacked Castra <b>Constantias,</b> a Roman fortress and marketplace {{on the banks}} of the Danube. The Eastern Romans stopped delivery of the agreed tribute, and they broke other conditions of the Treaty of Margus. The Hunnic kings turned their attention back to the Eastern Romans. Reports that the Bishop of Margus had crossed into Hun lands and desecrated royal graves further angered the Hun kings. War broke out between the two empires, and the Huns overcame a weak Roman army to raze the cities of Margus, Singidunum and Viminacium. Although a truce was signed in 441, two years later Constantinople again failed to deliver the tribute and war resumed. In the following campaign, Hun armies came alarmingly close to Constantinople, sacking Sardica, Arcadiopolis and Philippopolis along the way. Suffering a complete defeat at the Battle of Chersonesus, the Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius II gave in to Hun demands and in autumn 443 signed the Peace of Anatolius with the two Hun kings. The Huns returned to their lands with a vast train full of plunder.|$|R
