In particular, we show that given any ring R, a right R-module N, and a set X, End_R(⊕_X N) and End_R(∏_X N) are commutator rings {{if and only if}} either X is infinite or End_R(N) is itself a <b>commutator</b> <b>ring.</b> We also prove that over any ring, a matrix having trace zero can be expressed as a sum of two commutators.

Universal motors can run on either AC or DC.|$|R

40|$|Typically salient poles have {{windings}} forming coils {{wrapped around}} the waists (or pole cores) of each pole. This {{is true for the}} stator of the SRM but not for the rotor. The rotor has no windings, no coils, no magnets, no <b>commutator,</b> or slip <b>rings</b> it is only comprised of laminated steel sheets stamped {{in the shape of the}} pole design and mounted on a shaft. This allows for ease in manufacturing the rotor as well as reducing the rotor's inertia. There is also no electrical loss associated with the rotor since there are no windings, <b>commutator,</b> or slip <b>rings...</b>|$|R

40|$|Due {{to their}} characteristics, {{sintered}} Cu-C composites are {{materials used in}} electrical equipment. These characteristics include high electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and excellent resistance to abrasion. Currently, graphite nanopowder is used successfully as a carbon material. Metal-graphite, which is created on its basis, exists in different proportions of graphite to metal. A larger graphite content has {{a positive effect on}} smaller wear of <b>commutators</b> and <b>rings.</b> In contrast, a material with a higher copper content is used at high current densities.

25|$|The printed {{armature}} (originally {{formed on}} {{a printed circuit}} board) in a printed armature motor is made from punched copper sheets that are laminated together using advanced composites to form a thin rigid disc. The printed armature has a unique construction in the brushed motor world in {{that it does not}} have a separate <b>ring</b> <b>commutator.</b> The brushes run directly on the armature surface making the whole design very compact.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{electrical}} <b>commutators</b> use slip <b>rings</b> for coupling. Slip <b>rings</b> however inject <b>commutator</b> noise {{into the}} connection. This is because as the contact points slide {{over the surface}} of the slip-rings they make microscopic bumps. The resultant variation in resistance and inductance causes electrical noise in the circuit. To reduce the electrical noise the contact points need to be pressed against the slip rings with greater force. This leads to great resistance and a higher rate of wear.|$|R

We assign a Lie ring to the equation {{and study the}} function describing the dimensions of linear spaces spanned by multiple <b>commutators</b> of the <b>ring</b> generators. For the generic case this function grows exponentially. Examples show that for integrable equations it grows slower. We propose a classification scheme based on this observation.

50|$|Many rotary {{electrical}} machines require current to be conveyed to (or extracted from) a moving rotor, usually {{by means of}} sliding contacts: a <b>commutator</b> or slip <b>rings.</b> These contacts are often the most complex and least reliable part of such a machine. It may also represent a limit on the maximum current that the machine can handle. For this reason, when machines must use two sets of windings, the windings carrying the least current are usually placed on the rotor and those with the highest current on the stator.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{well-known}} theorem of Jacobson (1964, page 217) {{asserts that}} a ring R with the property that, for each x in R, there exists an integer n(x) > 1 such that xn(x) = x is necessarily commutative. This theorem is generalized {{to the case}} of a weakly periodic ring R with a “sufficient ” number of potent extended <b>commutators.</b> A <b>ring</b> R is called weakly periodic if every x in R can be written in the form x = a+b, where a is nilpotent and b is “potent ” in the sense that bn(b) = b for some integer n(b) > 1.

40|$|Relations and isomorphisms between {{quantum field}} {{theories}} in operator and functional integral formalisms are analyzed {{from the viewpoint}} of inequivalent representations of <b>commutator</b> or anticommutator <b>rings</b> of field operators. A functional integral in quantum field theory cannot be regarded as a Newton-Lebesgue integral but rather as a formal object to which one associates distinct numerical values for different processes of its integration. By choosing an appropriate method for the integration of a given functional integral, one can select a single representation out of infinitely many inequivalent representations for an operator whose trace is expressed by the corresponding functional integral. These properties are demonstrated with two exactly solvable examples. Comment: 9 page...|$|R
40|$|Hamiltonian of {{a system}} in quantum field theory can give rise to {{infinitely}} many partition functions which correspond to infinitely many inequivalent representations of the canonical <b>commutator</b> or anticommutator <b>rings</b> of field operators. This implies that the system can theoretically exist in infinitely many Gibbs states. The system resides in the Gibbs state which corresponds to its minimal Helmholtz free energy at a given range of the thermodynamic variables. Individual inequivalent representations are associated with different thermodynamic phases of the system. The BCS Hamiltonian of superconductivity is chosen to be an explicit example for the demonstration of {{the important role of}} inequivalent representations in practical applications. Its analysis from the inequivalent representations' point of view has led to a recognition of a novel type of the superconducting phase transition. Comment: 25 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

50|$|OEM {{machinery}} {{manufacturers are}} discovering {{the benefits of}} using a mercury swivel commutator in their designs. For example packaging machines use some type of <b>commutator</b> or slip <b>ring</b> as {{a connection to the}} moving parts that are heated to seal the packages closed after they are filled. It is critical that the temperature sensing circuit be reliable and accurate. Unfortunately, using a slip ring assembly or standard electrical slip ring may cause problems due to electrical noise and degradation of signal produced by the rubbing contacts of the slip rings. Many OEM machinery manufacturers have switched to using mercury swivel commutators for reliable and accurate temperature control. It is also desirable to pass the power and the temperature signal through the same rotating electrical connector in order to minimize the number of connector parts that must be built into the machine. Multiple channel mercury swivel commutators are used for this purpose.|$|R
40|$|Thesis for {{the degree}} of Bachelor of Science in {{electrical}} engineering. "Manuscript copy. Nearly every possible loss of power about a dynamo has been investigated more or less thoroughly and efforts made to eliminate such loss by careful design of the part in which the loss occurs. The losses at the brushes due to friction, electrical resistance, etc. have been investigated several times but {{the results of these}} tests do no always agree with each other and in so far as they do agree are not generally known. It is usual, in finding the losses of a machine, either experimentally or by calculation, to include the brush losses with the load losses. The actual value of the losses at the brushes is seldom known. Consideration of the lack of certain knowledge of this subject, led us to attempt this investigation. It was our original intention to investigate the voltage drop and contact resistance of several kinds of brushes at different current densities, different brush pressures, different speeds of rotation of the <b>commutator</b> or collector <b>rings,</b> different frequencies of alternating current, etc. Digitized at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia MU Libraries Digitization Lab in 2011...|$|R
