40|$|Abstract:- Blumlein pulsers {{are well}} suited devices for high voltage pulse {{generation}} {{in the range}} of nanoseconds or microseconds. They consist of pieces of transmission lines charged in parallel and discharged synchronously in series into the load by using a single switch. The main problems with this type of circuit are the presence of the shield cable impedance that contributes to the power loss of the device and the requirement of long lengths of lines for operation in the microsecond range. In view of that, this paper presents a construction method that minimizes these losses and reduces the generator size by using coaxial lines coiled up on cylindrical tubes. In particular, we report the construction of a 150 kV/ 300 A/ 1 µs Blumlein pulser that has been carried out in our laboratory, including a PSPICE simulation of the output pulse voltage of the generator.

50|$|Switched {{video or}} {{switched}} digital video (SDV), {{sometimes referred to}} as switched broadcast (SWB), is a telecommunications industry term for a network scheme for distributing digital video via a <b>cable.</b> <b>Switched</b> video sends the digital video in a more efficient manner so that additional uses may be made of the freed up bandwidth. The scheme applies to digital video distribution both on typical cable TV systems using QAM channels, or on IPTV systems. Users of analog video transmitted on the cable are unaffected.

40|$|Courses in {{computer}} networks require dedicated laboratories that {{are equipped with}} all the basic networking components: servers, workstations, <b>cables,</b> <b>switches,</b> routers, bridges, etc. An important element of a laboratory’s infrastructure is a variety of network configurations for specific experiments. A possible method of disseminating network configurations is a dedicated server. The server stores appropriate disk images, which can then be downloaded to student computers. An interesting and cost-effective alternative {{is the concept of}} virtual machines. Students do not waste time on reinstalling operating systems or rebooting computers and gain fast access to a selection of network configurations from local computers. In addition, complex experiments, such as analysing network protocols and services, securing confidential information transmitted over the Internet and testing redundant disk systems, can be implemented on a single computer without the need for the usual hardware components, such as <b>cables,</b> network cards, <b>switches</b> or multiple disk drives.

40|$|The {{world of}} {{computers}} experienced an explosive period of growth {{toward the end}} of the 20 th century with the widespread availability of the Internet and the development of the World Wide Web. As people began using computer networks for everything from research and communication to banking and commerce, network failures became a greater concern because of the potential to interrupt critical applications. Fault tolerance systems were developed to detect and correct network failures within minutes and eventually within seconds of the failure, but time-critical applications such as military communications, video conferencing, and Web-based sales require better response time than any previous systems could provide. The goal of this thesis was the development and implementation of a Network Fault Tolerance (NFT) system that can detect and recover from failures of network interface cards, network <b>cables,</b> <b>switches,</b> and routers in much less than one second from the time of failure. The problem was divided into two parts: fault tolerance within a single local area network (LAN), and fault tolerance across many local area networks. The rst par...|$|R
