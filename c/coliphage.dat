2500|$|Enterobacteria phage λ (lambda phage, <b>coliphage</b> λ) is a {{bacterial}} virus, or bacteriophage, that infects the bacterial species Escherichia coli (E. coli). [...] It {{was discovered by}} Esther Lederberg in 1950 when she noticed that streaks of mixtures of two E. coli strains, one of which treated with ultraviolet light, was [...] "nibbled and plaqued". The wild type of this virus has a temperate lifecycle that allows it to either reside within the genome of its host through lysogeny or enter into a lytic phase (during which it kills and lyses the cell to produce offspring); mutant strains are unable to lysogenize cells- instead they grow and enter the lytic cycle after superinfecting an already lysogenized cell.|$|E

MWRA has been monitoring its receiving waters for <b>coliphages,</b> anthropogenic viruses and indicator bacteria in order to evaluate the impact of Boston’s Deer Island Sewage Treatment Plant discharge. <b>Coliphages</b> and enteric viruses were originally assayed using single agar overlay and most probable number cell culture (MPN) methods, respectively. Reanalysis of these samples for enteric viruses by ICC-nPCR demonstrated that 46 % were positive {{for at least one}} virus compared with 23 % with the MPN method. Use of the enrichment method showed a 47 % increase in the detection of male specific and somatic <b>coliphages</b> compared with the single agar overlay method. Correlations between the presence of <b>coliphages,</b> enteric viruses and indicator bacteria were based on proximity to the treatment plant discharge, seasonal variations and site levels.

This study describes the development of positively charged microporous filters (Zeta Plus) for the concentration of <b>coliphages</b> from large volumes of water and wastewater. Four different <b>coliphages</b> were studied: MS- 2, phi X 174, T 2, and T 4. Positively charged microporous filters were found to efficiently adsorb these <b>coliphages</b> from tap water, sewage, and lake water at neutral pH. Adsorbed viruses were eluted with a 1 : 1 mixture of 8 % beef extract and 1 M sodium chloride at pH 9. Using this method, <b>coliphages</b> could be concentrated from 17 -liter volumes of tap water with recoveries ranging from 34 to 100 %. <b>Coliphages</b> occurring naturally in raw and secondarily treated sewage were recovered with average efficiencies of 56. 5 and 55. 0 %, respectively.

40|$|Limited water {{resources}} in Saudi Arabia necessitate the re-use of treated wastewater for irrigation, industrial and recreational purposes. The {{large numbers of}} pathogenic agents present in wastewater requires continuous monitoring of the removal of such agents from water prior to re-use. In a one year study total and faecal coliforms and <b>coliphages</b> were estimated in monthly samples from a wastewater treatment plant in Riyadh to evaluate the removal efficiency of such indicators at various levels of wastewater treatment. The efficiency of removal of total coliform (TC) and faecal coliform (FC) following aeration and sedimentation processes ranged between (18 - 34 %) and (17 - 38 %) respectively and for <b>coliphages</b> was (4 - 19 %). Chlorinated effluent had negligible counts of TC and FC with an efficiency of removal of (99. 2 - 100 %) and (99 - 100 %) for TC and FC respectively whereas the efficiency of removal of <b>coliphages</b> ranged between (91 - 100 %). As <b>coliphages</b> have been proposed as possible indicators of enteric viruses our study suggests their use as indicators of faecal pollution with traditional coliform indicators and the implementation of treatment measures more effective in virus removal in re-used wastewater.

40|$|Two {{groups of}} bacteriophages that infect Escherichia coli, somatic and F-specific <b>coliphages,</b> {{have been used}} in academia as both fecal and viral {{indicators}} for many years. Regulatory authorities {{in different parts of the}} world are beginning to consider <b>coliphages</b> as indicators of water quality in a range of settings. However, issues such as their potential replication in natural water environments, the cumbersome detection and enumeration methods, a lack of definition concerning which of the two groups should be included in future regulations, and the lack of a clear correlation between <b>coliphages</b> and human viruses and health risks in different water settings remain controversial. This review attempts to shed some light on these contentious issues. The conclusions are that: 1) supposing that they can replicate in some natural water settings, the contribution of <b>coliphages</b> replicated outside the gut will not affect the numbers contributed by fecal pollution and detected by strains recommended for standardized methods; 2) there are easy, fast, and cost-effective methods that can be used in routine laboratories after a little training; 3) perhaps the best option is to determine both groups in a single step; and 4) the low correlation of <b>coliphages</b> with human viruses and health risks is no worse than the correlation between different human viruses...|$|R

50|$|In virology, {{temperate}} {{refers to}} the ability of some bacteriophages (notably <b>coliphage</b> λ) to display a lysogenic life cycle. Many (but not all) temperate phages can integrate their genomes into their host bacterium's chromosome, together becoming a lysogen as the phage genome becomes a prophage. A temperate phage is also able to undergo a productive, typically lytic life cycle, where the prophage is expressed, replicates the phage genome, and produces phage progeny, which then leave the bacterium. With phage the term virulent is often used as an antonym to temperate, but more strictly a virulent phage is one that has lost its ability to display lysogeny through mutation rather than a phage lineage with no genetic potential to ever display lysogeny (which more properly would be described as an obligately lytic phage).|$|E
50|$|Following his {{graduation}} from Cornell, George under- took graduate {{studies in the}} genetics of T-even <b>coliphage</b> with S. E. Luria in the Bacteriology Department of the University of Illinois. His studies revealed phenotypic mixing, in which a phage with a host-range genotype of one phage type {{was found in a}} particle who was phenotypically dissimilar. When published in 1956, these studies had profound impact on the study of viral biology. During his postdoc at Caltech, with Jean Weigle, he undertook further studies on T2 × T4 hybrids, which led to the discovery of DNA modification (by glucosylation). At the University of Oregon, Streisinger pioneered the study of zebrafish in his lab. Zebrafish can be genetically modified easily, and researchers can modify them to mimic the traits of certain diseases. In analyzing these created diseases, scientists seek solutions to diseases which affect humans. Over 5,000 researchers in 450 labs throughout 31 countries study zebrafish, and many of them received their initial training at the University of Oregon.|$|E
40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{irradiation}} is {{a common}} way to disinfect drinking water, but some viruses are very resistant to UV. Drinking water was disinfected with UV after spiking with MS 2 and 18 different <b>coliphages</b> isolated from municipal wastewater effluent. In addition, some <b>coliphages</b> were disinfected with combined treatment of chlorine/UV or vice versa with UV/chlorine. A UV-dose of 22 mWs/cm 2 caused less than 2 Log 10 -reductions of 10 UV-resistant strains, while it caused up to 7 Log 10 -reductions for 9 UV-sensitive or intermediate strains. The high dose (117 mWs/cm 2) caused only 3 Log 10 -reductions in some UV-resistant <b>coliphages,</b> including MS 2, which {{proved to be a}} good indicator for viruses in UV-disinfection tests. The combined treatment with 0. 1 or 0. 5 mg Cl/L (free Cl-dosage 0. 04 or 0. 2 mg/L, respectively) for 10 min followed by UV irradiation of 22 mWs/cm 2 inactivated all <b>coliphages</b> tested by > 3. 6 Log 10 -units. Synergy was obtained for most <b>coliphages</b> tested by using a Cl/UV combination, and the inactivation using first low Cl-dosages followed by low UV-dosages was higher than if using high Cl- or UV-dosages alone.

Several variables were tested and provided valuable {{information that was}} not included in standard methodologies. The most important findings are described, such as the effect of using an excessively concentrated culture of E. coliand production of a log phase culture in only 4 hours of incubation, adjusting the concentration to an optical density of 0. 3 at 600 nm (3. 1 x 10 8 CFU / mL), or to McFarland 1 (3. 0 x 108 CFU / mL). It was determined that <b>coliphages</b> controls must be stored at - 70 °C to reduce its degradation.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the presence of pathogenic viruses in the Moselle River and to compare the usefulness of thermotolerant coliforms and somatic <b>coliphages</b> as tools for river water quality assessment in terms of viral contamination. Thermotolerant coliforms and somatic <b>coliphages</b> were enumerated by standardized methods in 170 samples of river water drawn from five sampling sites along the Moselle River (eastern France). BGM cell culture and integrated cell culture-reverse transcription-PCR DNA enzyme immunoassay were used to determine the presence of pathogenic viral genome (Enterovirus and Norovirus genogroup II [GGII]) and infectious Enterovirus spp. in 90 1 -liter samples. No infectious Enterovirus spp. were isolated, but Enterovirus and Norovirus GGII genomes were detected in 38 % of the samples. Norovirus GGII genome was mostly detected in winter, whereas Enterovirus genome was mostly detected in summer and fall. Somatic <b>coliphages</b> appeared to be less sensitive to higher river water temperature than thermotolerant coliforms. Furthermore, the number of river water samples positive for pathogenic viral genome increased with increasing concentration of somatic <b>coliphages,</b> whereas coliform concentration was unrelated to viral genome contamination. Consequently somatic <b>coliphages,</b> which are less sensitive to environmental factors than thermotolerant coliforms in river water, would provide a promising tool for assessment of river water quality in terms of fecal and viral pollution...|$|R
5000|$|Processive antitermination can be {{mediated}} by RNA {{as well as}} proteins. <b>Coliphage</b> HK022, alone among the known lambdoid phages, does not encode an analog to lambda N. Instead, it promotes antitermination of early phage transcription through the direct action of transcribed sequences called put (for polymerase utilization) sites. There are two closely related put sites, one located in the PL operon and the other located in the PR operon, roughly corresponding to {{the positions of the}} nut sequences in lambda and in other lambda relatives. put sites act in cis to promote readthrough of downstream terminators in the absence of all HK022 proteins. The put transcripts are predicted to form two stem-loops separated by a single unpaired nucleotide. This prediction is supported by mutational studies and the pattern of sensitivity of the two RNAs to cleavage with single- and double-strand-specific endoribonucleases. RNA structure is critical to antitermination because mutations that prevent the formation of base pairs in the stems reduce function, and these mutations can be suppressed by additional mutations that restore base pairing. Like lambda N and Q, the PUT sequences suppress polymerase pausing and promote processive antitermination in a purified in vitro transcription system. In contrast to lambda N, no phage or auxiliary bacterial factors are required. The only mutations known to block PUT-mediated antitermination change highly conserved amino acids located in a cysteine-rich amino-proximal domain of the RNAP beta' subunit. Strains carrying these mutations are unable to support lytic growth of HK022 but are normal in all other respects tested, including lytic growth of lambda and other lambda relatives. The phage-restricted phenotypes conferred by these mutations suggest that they alter a domain of RNAP-beta’ that interacts specifically with nascent PUT RNA in the transcription elongation complex, but this idea has not been directly tested. The stability of the putative PUT-RNAP interaction {{and the nature of the}} PUT-induced modification to the elongation complex are unknown.|$|E

Experiments were conducted outdoors, using 300 -liter 2 % (vol/vol) sewage-seawater mixtures held in open-top chambers. Dark inactivation rates (kDs), measured from exponential survival curves in enclosed (control) chambers, were higher in summer (temperature range: 14 to 20 °C) than in winter (temperature range: 8 to 10 °C). Winter kDs were highest for fecal coliforms and lowest for F-RNA phages but {{were the same}} or similar for all three indicators in summer. Sunlight inactivation rates (kS), {{as a function of}} cumulative global solar radiation (insolation), were all higher than the kDs with a consistent kS ranking (from greatest to least) as follows: fecal coliforms, F-RNA phages, and somatic <b>coliphages.</b> Phage inactivation was exponential, but bacterial curves typically exhibited a shoulder. Phages from raw sewage exhibited kSs similar to those from waste stabilization pond effluent, but raw sewage fecal coliforms were inactivated faster than pond effluent fecal coliforms. In an experiment which included F-DNA phages and Bacteroides fragilis phages, the kS ranking (from greatest to least) was as follows: fecal coliforms, F-RNA phages, B. fragilis phages, F-DNA phages, and somatic <b>coliphages.</b> In a 2 -day experiment which included enterococci, the initial concentration ranking (from greatest to least: fecal coliforms, enterococci, F-RNA phages, and somatic <b>coliphages)</b> was reversed during sunlight exposure, with only the phages remaining detectable by the end of day 2. Inactivation rates under different optical filters decreased with the increase in spectral cutoff wavelength (50 % light transmission) and indicated that F-RNA phages and fecal coliforms are more susceptible than somatic <b>coliphages</b> to longer solar wavelengths, which predominate in seawater.

Cultivable enteroviruses were detected in 55 % of the samples, most of which complied with bacteriological criteria. In contrast, viral genomes were only detected in 20 % of the samples by reverse transcription-PCR. Somatic <b>coliphages</b> outnumbered all other indicators.

In situ inactivation experiments showed that viruses persisted significantly longer than the bacterial indicators. Only somatic <b>coliphages</b> and bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides persisted longer than the viruses.

Depuration under stressful conditions appeared to have a negligible affect on poliovirus and <b>coliphage</b> elimination rates from mussels. However, the rate and pattern of E. coli elimination were dramatically affected by these conditions. Therefore, monitoring E. coli counts might prove useful in ensuring that mussels are functioning well during depuration...|$|E
40|$|MS 2 <b>coliphage</b> (ATCC 15597 -B 1) {{has been}} {{proposed}} by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency as a surrogate for enteric viruses to determine the engineering requirements of chemical disinfection systems {{on the basis of}} previous experience with chlorine. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether MS 2 <b>coliphage</b> was a suitable indicator for the inactivation of enteric viruses when ozone disinfection systems were used. Bench-scale experiments were conducted in 2 -liter-batch shrinking reactors containing ozone demand-free 0. 05 M phosphate buffer (pH 6. 9) at 22 degrees C. Ozone was added as a side stream from a concentrated stock solution. It was found that an ozone residual of less than 40 micrograms/liter at the end of 20 s inactivated greater than 99. 99 % of MS 2 <b>coliphage</b> in the demand-free buffer. When MS 2 was compared directly with poliovirus type 3 in paired experiments, 1. 6 log units more inactivation was observed with MS 2 <b>coliphage</b> than with poliovirus type 3. It was concluded that the use of MS 2 <b>coliphage</b> as a surrogate organism for studies of enteric virus with ozone disinfection systems overestimated the inactivation of enteric viruses. It is recommended that the regulatory agencies evaluate their recommendations for using MS 2 <b>coliphage</b> as an indicator of enteric viruses...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} tissue distribution of Escherichia coli and a <b>coliphage</b> after contamination of the common mussel (Mytilus edulis). Mussels were contaminated {{with high levels of}} feces-associated E. coli and a 22 -nm icosahedral <b>coliphage</b> over a 2 -day period in a flowing-seawater facility. After contamination, individual tissues were carefully dissected and assayed for E. coli and the <b>coliphage.</b> Contaminated mussels were also analyzed to determine the tissue distribution of the contaminants after 24 - and 48 -h depuration periods. The majority of each contaminant was located in the digestive tract (94 and 89 % of E. coli and <b>coliphage,</b> respectively). Decreasing concentrations were found in the gills and labial palps, foot and muscles, mantle lobes, and hemolymph. Our results indicate that contamination above levels in water occurred only in the digestive tract. Contaminated mussels were depurated in a commercial-scale recirculating UV depuration system over a 48 -h period. The percent reductions of E. coli occurred in the following order: digestive tract, hemolymph, foot and muscles, mantle lobes, and gills and labial palps. The percent reductions of the <b>coliphage</b> were different, occurring in the following order: hemolymph, foot and muscles, gills and labial palps, mantle lobes, and digestive tract. Our results clearly demonstrate that E. coli and the <b>coliphage</b> are differentially eliminated from the digestive tract. The two microorganisms are eliminated at similar rates from the remaining tissues. Our results also clearly show that the most significant <b>coliphage</b> retention after depuration for 48 h is in the digestive tract. Thus, conventional depuration practices are inappropriate for efficient virus elimination from mussels...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{increased}} interest {{in the use of}} male-specific or F+ <b>coliphages</b> as indicators of microbial inputs to source waters. Sero- or genotyping of these <b>coliphages</b> can also be used for microbial source tracking (MST). Among the male-specific <b>coliphages,</b> the F+ RNA (FRNA) viruses are well studied, while {{little is known about the}} F+ DNA (FDNA) viruses. We have developed a reverse line blot hybridization (RLB) assay which allows for the simultaneous detection and genotyping of both FRNA as well as FDNA <b>coliphages.</b> These assays included a novel generic duplex reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay for FRNA viruses as well as a generic PCR for FDNA viruses. The RT-PCR assays were validated by using 190 field and prototype strains. Subsequent DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of RT-PCR products revealed the classification of six different FRNA clusters, including the well-established subgroups I through IV, and three different FDNA clusters, including one (CH) not previously described. Within the leviviruses, a potentially new subgroup (called JS) including strains having more than 40 % nucleotide sequence diversity with the known levivirus subgroups (MS 2 and GA) was identified. We designed subgroup-specific oligonucleotides that were able to genotype all nine (six FRNA, three FDNA) different clusters. Application of the method to a panel of 351 enriched phage samples from animal feces and wastewater, including known prototype strains (MS 2, GA, Qβ, M 11, FI, and SP for FRNA and M 13, f 1, and fd for FDNA), resulted in successful genotyping of 348 (99 %) of the samples. In summary, we developed a novel method for standardized genotyping of F+ <b>coliphages</b> as a useful tool for large-scale MST studies...|$|R
40|$|Foodborne illness {{outbreaks}} {{associated with}} fresh produce have {{increased over the}} past decade. Food workers employed at full-service restaurants are found to perform risky food practices more often than food workers employed in other segments of the foodservice industry. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine if differences in restaurant ownership format, business volume, and salad type influenced the level of indicator organisms present in restaurant salads. Overall levels of heterotrophic bacteria, total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, male-specific <b>coliphages,</b> and somatic <b>coliphages</b> were determined by aerobic plate counts (APC), Colilert?, Enterolert?, and U. S. EPA (Method 1601 and 1602), respectively. Molecular methods including automated rep-PCR DiversiLab? system and reverse transcriptase-PCR were used for the DNA fingerprinting of E. coli and the genotyping of male-specific <b>coliphages,</b> respectively. All of the above mentioned indicator organisms were present in the restaurant salads. Comparisons between restaurant types found that levels of APC, Enterococcus, and male-specific <b>coliphages</b> were significantly higher in locally owned restaurants and levels of total coliforms and somatic <b>coliphages</b> were significantly higher in corporate restaurants. The levels for all indicator organisms were significantly higher in specialty salads compared to leafy greens salads. Comparisons between business volumes suggested that indicator organism counts were higher during low customer traffic sampling periods. These results suggested that there were differences in safe food handling practices between locally owned and corporate restaurants. Staffing and labor issues as a result of low customer traffic and the need for additional handling and preparation of specialty salads seemed to increase the risk of cross-contamination issues for fresh produce. DNA fingerprinting for E. coli revealed that the same organism was found at multiple restaurants. These results indicate that there was a common source of contamination somewhere between field production and distribution. Genotyping results for male-specific <b>coliphages</b> found that some of the produce had been exposed to human and animal sources of contamination. Overall, the monitoring for indicator organisms in restaurant salads found that there is still a need for improved education-based programs in the area of safe food handling practice associated with fresh produce for food workers in restaurants...|$|R
40|$|Land {{application}} of animal manure {{is an important}} means of utilization of nitrogen and phosphorus. However, the presence of pathogens in manure and their occasional leaching into subsurface water has become a topic of concern {{during the past few}} years. This study was undertaken {{to determine the extent to}} which Salmonella anatum may leach through tile-drained clay loam soil on which swine manure has been applied. For this purpose, swine manure was experimentally contaminated with S. anatum and applied to three tile-drained plots in winter of 2001 while another three plots served as negative controls. Following rainfall events in the spring of 2002 the tiles started to flow and leachate samples of subsurface water were collected at various time intervals and tested for S. anatum. Salmonella anatum was not found to leach into the subsurface drainage water indicating that it was either retained in the upper layers of soil or did not survive over winter. The leaching of faecal coliforms and <b>coliphages</b> was also tested. Faecal coliforms and <b>coliphages</b> were detected in the subsurface water from both manure and control plots, indicating the ability of the tile drainage system to transport these organisms to groundwater as the water percolates through the soil. Additional temporal studies over a longer time period are needed to determine the survival and leaching of pathogens and indicators into subsurface water.
