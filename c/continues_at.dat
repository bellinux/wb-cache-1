5|$|The A82 <b>continues</b> <b>at</b> {{the north}} end of the loch, along the western edge of the River Ness, which runs {{parallel}} alongside the canal towards Inverness city centre. Immediately after entering the urban area, the road crosses the canal at the Tomnahurich Swing Bridge. Now inside Inverness, the road passes Queen's Park stadium and heads towards the city centre. It crosses the Ness at the Friar's Bridge, bypassing the city centre to pass through the docklands and associated industrial estates as an urban dual carriageway. The road ends at a roundabout with the A9 just south of Kessock Bridge.|$|E

5|$|The Greaves Welsh Slate Company {{produces}} roofing slates {{and other}} slate products from Llechwedd, and work also <b>continues</b> <b>at</b> the Berwyn Quarry near Llangollen. The final large-scale underground working to close was Maenofferen, {{associated with the}} Llechwedd tourist mine, in 1999: part of this site, now effectively amalgamated with Votty / Bowydd, is still worked by untopping. The Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff uses waste slate in many different colours in its design: purple slate from Penrhyn, blue from Cwt-y-Bugail, green from Nantlle, grey from Llechwedd, and black from Corris.|$|E
5|$|This type of {{profile is}} common for dives at sites {{where there is a}} flat sea-bed or where the diver remains at the same place {{throughout}} the dive to work. It is the most demanding profile for decompression for a given maximum depth and time because inert gas absorption <b>continues</b> <b>at</b> maximum rate for most of the dive. Decompression tables are drawn up {{based on the assumption that}} the diver may follow a square profile.|$|E
5|$|Birds are hunted in many {{countries}} around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as mallard, wigeon, shoveler and teal have for centuries been captured by wildfowlers, while pheasants, partridges, grouse, and snipe are among the terrestrial birds that are hunted for sport, generally with guns. In {{other parts of the}} world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where cassowaries, crowned pigeons, hornbills and megapodes are captured for food. Seabirds such as muttonbirds, penguins and auks have been hunted for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the great auk, extinct. Seabird hunting <b>continues</b> <b>at</b> more moderate levels today, for instance with the traditional Māori harvest of sooty shearwater chicks.|$|E

5|$|The Sun's {{convection}} zone {{extends from}} 0.7 solar radii (200,000km) to near the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense enough or {{hot enough to}} transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. Instead, {{the density of the}} plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry the majority of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks {{to the base of the}} convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle <b>continues.</b> <b>At</b> the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/6,000 the density of air at sea level).|$|E
