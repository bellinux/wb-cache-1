The block was later lifted and then reinstated after Iran's 2009 presidential election. In 2012, Iran reblocked access, along with access to Google, after the controversial film Innocence of Muslims trailer was released on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 13 {{million people}} went whale watching globally in 2008, in all oceans except the Arctic. Rules and <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> {{have been created}} to minimize harassment of the whales. Iceland, Japan and Norway have both whaling and whale watching industries. Whale watching lobbyists {{are concerned that the}} most inquisitive whales, which approach boats closely and provide much of the entertainment on whale-watching trips, {{will be the first to}} be taken if whaling is resumed in the same areas. Whale watching generated US$2.1 billion (UK£1.4 billion) per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers. In contrast, the whaling industry, with the moratorium in place, generates US$31 million (UK£20 million) per year. The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the whaling industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource.|$|E

The main problem needs to be answered in this research is what the function <b>of</b> ethical <b>code</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> for curator in performing {{his job as a}} curator is. This research was conducted using the methods of law approach and conceptual approach with secondary law obtained from the library which is needed in order to identify those sources systematically. The results showed that there are several functions <b>of</b> ethical <b>code</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> curator that are important for curator in performing his job and the mechanism of giving sanction to curator who breaks the <b>code</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> is also clearly described in <b>code</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> curator issued by organization of curator existing in Indonesia...|$|R
40|$|The EAAB (Estate Agency Affairs Board), a {{statutory}} {{body for}} the South African real estate industry, introduced an extensive <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conduct</b> in 1992. The research conducted will serve to determine whether this <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conduct</b> is effective in ensuring ethical behaviour by real estate agents. Both qualitative and quantitative research was undertaken, whereby {{it was determined that}} there is indeed a level of unethical behaviour amongst real estate agents, that a majority of such agents were unable to interpret specific clauses in the <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conduct,</b> {{and that there was no}} clear correlation between support for the <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conduct</b> and moral intent. Qualitative interviews highlighted the various roles that stakeholders do and should play in training and enforcement <b>of</b> the <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conduct,</b> and their insights helped provide the basis for recommendations to the Estate Agency Affairs Board on improving the effectiveness <b>of</b> the EAAB <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conduct.</b> Key recommendations to the EAAB were that a revision <b>of</b> the <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conduct</b> was needed, entry requirements into the industry should be more stringent, a professional image for the industry should be promoted, and improved communication between the EAAB and stakeholders, improved enforcement and higher penalties, and an extensive training and education programme on Ethics and the <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conduct</b> were needed. A Ten Element Model for an Effective <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conduct</b> was proposed that detailed ten key themes arising from the research which could also be applicable in other industries. The forces and importance of communication, debate and consultation between society and industry, through regulatory bodies and/or professional associations provided the foundation for the development and revision <b>of</b> the <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conduct.</b> To ensure effectiveness, the <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conduct</b> needed to be supported by an ethical culture, professionalisation of the industry, support and understanding <b>of</b> the <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conduct</b> by stakeholders, exposure, education and training on the <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conduct</b> and Ethics, enforcement, penalties and consumer education...|$|R

In particular, the study sought to address the question of what constitutes the ethical <b>code</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> among Yemeni professional accountants. To address the question, data were collected from 386 users of accounting information in four main cities of Yemen i. e. Sana’a, Hadhramout, Taiz, and Aden.
