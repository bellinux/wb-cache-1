After absorption into the skin it is recognized by the immune system's dendritic cells, otherwise called Langerhans cells. These cells then migrate to the lymph nodes, where they present the urushiol to T-lymphocytes and thus recruit them to the skin, and the T-lymphocytes cause pathology through the production of cytokines and <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>damage</b> to the skin.|$|E

40|$|The action mode of 4, 4 '-diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS) {{is still}} under debate, {{although}} {{it has long been}} used in treatment of several dermatologic diseases including Hansen's disease. In this study, we tested the effect of DDS as an antioxidant on paraquat-induced oxidative stress in non-phagocytic human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs). Overall, preincubation of HDFs with DDS prevented the oxidative stress and the resulting <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>damages</b> caused by paraquat in these cells. The specific effects of DDS in paraquat-treated HDFs are summarized as follows: a) reducing the expression of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX 4) by inhibiting paraquat-induced activation of PKC; b) inhibiting paraquat-induced decreases in mitochondrial complex protein levels as well as in membrane potentials; c) consequently, inhibiting the generation of cytosolic and mitochondrial superoxide anions. Taken together, these findings suggest that DDS would suppress the radical generation in non-phagocytic HDFs during oxidative stress, and that DDS might have the extended potential to be used further in prevention of other oxidative stress-related pathologies...|$|R

At this regard, the higher presence of lobed and notched nuclei in both fish species sampled at the site 3 indicates the presence of <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>damage</b> in peripheral erythrocytes; furthermore, based on our results it is possible to infer that A. gr. bimaculatus is more sensitive to the formation of this type of nuclear abnormalities.|$|E

ChBac 3. 4 exhibited broadspectrum antimicrobial activity, especially under low salt conditions. Since E. coli ML 35 p treated with ChBac 3. 4 manifested increased outer and inner membrane permeability and a rapid and extensive loss of cytoplasmic potassium, the antimicrobial properties of this peptide may depend, in part, {{on its ability to}} damage microbial membranes.

This study investigated the acute cellular damages triggered by UVB exposure of cultured human fibroblasts and keratinocyte cells immediately and 24 Â h post exposure in order to understand damage onset and progression. The study evaluated a number of cellular parameters including mitochondria, lysosomes, cell membrane, DNA damages as well as pro and anti-apoptotic protein expression levels. Cellular organelle damages were assessed by a battery of in vitro toxicological assays using MTS and Neutral red cytotoxicity assays. Cell membrane damages were also assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme leakage from UVB exposed cells. Lastly DNA damages was assessed using the comet assay while protein expression was evaluated using Western Blot. In this study we reported in all our assay systems (MTS, NR and LDH) that cellular damages were UVB dose dependent with damages amplified 24 Â h post exposure. Our results also indicated that incubation of exposed cells for a period of 24 Â h increased the sensitivity of the assay systems used. The increased sensitivity in detecting early <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>damages</b> was manifested though organelle damage measurement at very low doses which were not manifested immediately post exposure.
