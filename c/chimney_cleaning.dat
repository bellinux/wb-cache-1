50|$|In this Leg's Roadblock, {{one team}} member chose a chimney sweep {{instructor}} {{and then put}} on the traditional chimney sweep uniform. They {{then went to the}} roof of the building and used a weight with wire mesh on a rope to clean one of the chimneys three times. Once complete, they went to the basement and opened up one of the <b>chimney</b> <b>cleaning</b> doors that held their next clue.|$|E
50|$|Today, chimney sweeps still {{maintain}} a thriving new industry {{in many parts}} of the world. The industry has expanded from the maintenance of wood-burning fireplace and appliance venting systems to include venting for many types of heating appliances, such as heating oil, natural gas, wood and pellet burning appliances, building furnaces and space heaters. The standard chimney brush is still used, along with more modern tools (such as vacuums, cameras and special <b>chimney</b> <b>cleaning</b> tools), although most sweeps are done from the bottom of the chimney, rather than the top, to prevent the dispersion of dust and debris.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays the {{concrete}} {{is one of}} the most important and most commonly used materials of the construction. Buildings, bridges, dams, tunnels, pires, <b>chimneys,</b> <b>cleaning</b> equipment are constructed using concrete. These buildings are constantly affected by aggressive environment. These structures must be resistant to frost, chemical, sea water effect. Concrete absorbs water, because concrete is less resistant to aggressive environments. In this study, est are carried out using additives which form crystals. This additive reduces the water absorption. The study is determined for w/c ratio with the additives and without it for influence of density, mobility, strength and water absorption...|$|R

50|$|During {{this period}} {{there was a}} {{movement}} to prevent boys being employed in <b>cleaning</b> <b>chimneys.</b> The Society for Superseding the Necessity of Climbing Boys (SSNCB) was founded in 1803 under the patronage of the Duchess of Gloucester. The SSNCB and the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce promoted a competition for an effective apparatus for <b>cleaning</b> <b>chimneys.</b> Several systems were invented; one invented by George Smart was awarded a gold medal by the Society of Arts in 1805. However it {{had little effect on}} the campaign.|$|R

50|$|It {{is later}} {{revealed}} that the killer Santa is Ronald Jones Jr., owner of a local <b>chimney</b> <b>cleaning</b> and repair service, and he survived the flamethrower attack. During {{the hunt for the}} killer, Aubrey learns from another Santa portrayer that Ronald Sr. had crashed his ex-wife's Christmas party many years ago, burning her alive with the homemade flamethrower. Aubrey's father was the police officer that responded to the situation and gunned him down, only to find out that Ronald Jr. was in his father's truck watching the entire time. The tragedy caused Ronald Jr. to go insane and seek revenge, dressing as Santa so he would not get caught during Cryer's Christmas festivities.|$|E
50|$|Today, chimney sweeps {{are still}} operating, as venting systems for coal, heating oil, natural gas, wood and pellet burning {{appliances}} {{need to be}} maintained. There is {{a greater understanding of}} the dangers of flue deposits and carbon monoxide and gases from combustion. The standard chimney brush is still used, along with more modern tools (such as vacuums, cameras and special <b>chimney</b> <b>cleaning</b> tools). Most sweeps are done {{from the bottom of the}} chimney, rather than the top, to prevent the dispersion of dust and debris and because it is safer for the chimney sweep to do the sweeping from this position. Inspection may be done from the bottom or top, or both if accessible.|$|E
50|$|Soot also {{tends to}} form in {{chimneys}} in domestic houses possessing one or more fireplaces. If a large deposit collects in one, it can ignite and create a <b>chimney</b> fire. Regular <b>cleaning</b> by a <b>chimney</b> sweep should eliminate the problem.|$|R
50|$|Later in his life, Wilds junior experimented {{in other}} areas: he invented {{a new way}} of <b>cleaning</b> <b>chimneys,</b> {{proposed}} a breakwater to protect Brighton's coastline, and served as an officer of the Brighton Commissioners for three years from 1842. In 1852, the Commissioners asked him to plant elm trees along the road to Brighton Racecourse; this road became known as Elm Grove. He moved to Shoreham-by-Sea, where he died in 1857. He was buried at the town's St Nicolas' Church.|$|R
50|$|Cadman {{was born}} in Coventry, on 10 December 1843, the {{youngest}} of five children of Elijah Cadman (1820-1846), a drunkard, and Mary (n√©e Poole). The father was transported to Australia in June 1845 for stealing, one of 300 convicts transported on the Equestrian, and Elijah Cadman started work as a silk weaver alongside his mother and sister. Aged six Cadman was unusually small and, because of his size, found work at that age climbing and <b>cleaning</b> <b>chimneys</b> for a chimney sweep. He would start work at 4 a.m. and continued climbing chimneys until he was 13, when the British Government passed a law which stopped boys from working up chimneys.|$|R
40|$|This work {{endeavours}} to map {{the development}} and actual level of chimney and flue cleaning in the Czech Republic including the appraisal of statutory instruments {{during the period from}} 1751 to 2015. The aim is to compare the techniques and methods of <b>chimney</b> <b>cleaning</b> used in the past {{as well as in the}} present and their effect on health and enviromental protection and safety. The work is divided into two parts. The theoretical one introduces historical changes of rules defining cleaning of chimneys and combustion tracks in Czech lands in the past. The present technologies are being described as well as conditions of fire safety for functioning of chimneys and flues. This part is also following up checking and revisions of combustion tracks, measuring efficiency of combustion, burning of chimneys, frequency of checking and cleaning of chimneys etc. The following sections pay attention to documents dealing with classification of types of chimneys, technical and safety standards for safe working of combustion tracks and the impact of techniques of cleaning on health and enviromental protection and safety. In the second part of this work the results extracted from the questionnaire survey are presented. The results are devided into three chapters according to the three main areas the survey was focused on. The first chapter compares statutory instruments, prevention, checking and methods of chimney clearing and their effect on health, safety and environment. The second chapter pays attention to the same topics but in present days. In the last chapter the research is based on statistic numbers of fires in the particular periods. For the research the methods of analysis and appraisal of technical books, legal standards and information from internet sources were used. The qualitative research was evaluated by methods of comparison and analysis. By the means of analysis and appraisal of information from relevant literature the methods of cleaning of chimneys in particular periods of existence of chimney sweeping profession were compared. The main research was based on the evaluation of the answers to eleven questions concerning the issues of cleaning chimneys and the impact on health and enviromental protection and safety. The questions were presented to chimney sweepers in the form of an electronic questionnaire which was sent to two hundred persons from the whole area of the Czech Republic by e-mail. From the mentioned number 26 respondents sent their answers back. The results of the questionnaire survey were evaluated by the method of comparison individual opinions of the respondents were compared and after that the summary answers about various aspects related to chimney sweeping profession were made. The aim of this work was to compare the development of methods of <b>chimney</b> <b>cleaning</b> during various periods of existence of chimney sweeping profession and also to appraise the situation in the present days, including statutory instruments. The results of the research should have answered two main questions the first one should have assessed the effect of methods of <b>chimney</b> <b>cleaning</b> used in the present on health and enviromental protection and safety in comparison with the methods used in the past. The answer to the second one should have appraised legislation which deals with issues of <b>chimney</b> <b>cleaning</b> from the point of its comprehensiveness. The research shows that the techniques and methods of cleaning chimneys and flues used in the present guarantee better and higher health and enviromental protection and safety than the methods used in the past. However it is necessary to mention the fact that the number of fires which arise because of the chimney activity is still relatively high. According to the legislation the results show that the actual laws and regulations are sufficient, however in some aspects, especially in education system and professional preparation of chimney sweepers, we can find substantial defects...|$|E
5000|$|Black {{sugar is}} a form of {{crystalline}} precipitate or a particulate pollution by-product unique from creosote caused by the burning of low grade coal in the 1940-1960s. The outgas from burning coal would be a by-product (burning coal was used in residential forced hot air furnaces) for the heating of family housing. Black sugar was often found on porches and the cold ductwork and caused the high carbon, soot-loaded gas to precipitate on the floors and walls and crystallize. Outward appearance was that of very fine, shiny coal, but would not combust when exposed to flames. After a time, the crystalline material would become powdered, to the consistency of white cane sugar, but retain a fine, shiny, black texture, thus the name [...] "black sugar". The material would often be cleaned from duct work by <b>chimney</b> sweeps or <b>cleaning</b> staff on a regular basis in the Beaver-Ambridge-Monaca area of Pennsylvania along the Ohio River near Pittsburgh.|$|R

50|$|In {{processes}} and occupations under {{the scope of}} the Child Labour Law children may not be employed by their parents or guardians before Jo years of age or by other employers before 12 years of age; nor between the hours of 8 P.M. and 8 A.M., nor otherwise than in full compliance with requirements of educational authorities for school attendance and with due regard to prescribed pauses. In school term time the daily limit of employment for children is three hours, in holiday time three hours. As regards factories Germany, unlike Great Britain, France and Switzerland, requires a shorter day for young persons than for women - io hours for the former, t t hours for the latter. Women over 16 years may be employed i 1 hours. Night work is forbidden, i.e. work between 8.30 P.M. and 5.30 A.M. Overtime may be granted to meet unforeseen pressure or for work on perishable articles, under conditions, by local authorities and the higher administrative authorities. Prescribed meal-times are - an unbroken half-hour for children in their 6 hours; for young persons a midday pause of one hour, and half an hour respectively in the morning and afternoon spells; for women, an hour at midday, but women with the care of a household have the claim, on demand, to an extra halfhour, as in Switzerland. No woman may be employed within four weeks after childbirth, and unless a medical certificate can then be produced, the absence must extend to six weeks. Notice of working periods and meal-times must be affixed, and copies sent to the local authorities. Employment of protected persons in factory industries where there are special risks to health or morality may be forbidden or made dependent on special conditions. By the Child Labour Law employment of children is forbidden in brickworks, stone breaking, <b>chimney</b> sweeping, street <b>cleaning</b> and other {{processes and}} occupations. By an order of the Federal Council in 1902 female workers were excluded from main processes in forges and rolling mills.|$|R
