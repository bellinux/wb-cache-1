40|$|An {{innovative}} {{integrated approach}} to the testing and comparison of motorcycle drive chain lubricants is presented. This is a novel way of testing the lubrication by using loaded operating <b>chains</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets.</b> A test rig {{has been designed to}} operate <b>chains</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets</b> in a clean environment and allow direct comparison between different lubricants. The advantage of this method over previous techniques is that it allows the differentiation of lubricants in a more controlled operating environment and evaluates the overall lubricant performance as opposed to individual properties. The lubricants tested were a wax spray, PTFE spray and drip fed light oil. The test rig allowed measurement of the power saved by the lubricant in running the <b>chains</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets.</b> <b>Chain</b> length <b>and</b> component masses were also taken before and after running the <b>chains</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets</b> under load on the test rig. The results clearly show that any lubricant is preferable to none. The drip fed oil provided the greatest power saving and wear protection between the <b>chain</b> rollers <b>and</b> pins and the spray lubricants provided the highest level of protection between rollers <b>and</b> <b>sprockets...</b>|$|R

50|$|Eventually, Red Star {{was put on}} the run between Sicamous, British Columbia and Enderby, British Columbia. However, {{she drew}} too much water, so R. P. Rithet had a flat-bottomed, scow-shaped {{stern-wheeler}} of light draft built, where he placed Red Star's machinery. The machinery was not suitable for a stern-wheeler, so the paddle wheel had to be driven with a <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket</b> wheel. and to overcome the difficulty the paddle wheel was driven with a <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket</b> wheel. This vessel became known as Red Star No. 2 and thus, the original Red Star's long and varied career ended.|$|E
50|$|The central section, {{which was}} {{designed}} as a swing bridge to allow shipping to pass, no longer opens and is welded shut, although the rotating mechanism - hydraulic cylinders attached to a drive <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket</b> - is still visible beneath the bridge.|$|E

5000|$|This {{progression}} {{has provided}} more fine adjustment of gear ratio, however {{the use of}} thinner metal parts has {{had the effect of}} shortening the life-span of the <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets</b> due to so called [...] "stretching" [...] of the chain. This is caused by frictional abrasion of the load-bearing surfaces of the chain causing elongation. As such, the <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets</b> of a nine-speed system require more frequent replacement than an eight. The narrowing of the hub flanges has created more dish in the wheel, which weakens the wheel if all other factors are the same, but improvements in the strength and reliability of spokes and rims has more than balanced this out, and wheel strength is generally higher despite the increased dish.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} unique nature, beach races {{tend to be}} very popular with riders and spectators, with some of the larger races {{attracting}} several hundred riders. However beach racing is known to be very tough on motorcycles, small sand particles can damage wheel bearings, <b>chains</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets,</b> <b>and</b> the soft, sandy surface increases the demand on engines and clutches. Experienced beach racers typically follow meticulous bike maintenance prior to the event in order to ensure their bike will not fail.|$|R

50|$|A gear case, {{also known}} as a chain case or chainguard, is an {{enclosure}} for the bicycle <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket</b> assemblages commonly employed by utility bicycles. It serves to protect the cyclist from being soiled or trapped in the chain rings and tends to fully enclose the drive train. It may also contain an oil bath to keep the chain lubricated. Modern examples are usually moulded in plastic. Similar devices may be found in connection with chains used on larger vehicles and machinery.|$|E

50|$|An {{attachment}} {{to a regular}} bicycle can be built to allow the bike {{to be used as}} the seat, pedals, <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket</b> of the thresher. The bicycle must be on a stand so that the back wheel is raised off the ground. Plans have been developed to build the attachment and the wheel-stand out of pieces of metal, including a large wheel that can be screwed to the crank section of the thresher (see External links). A drill will be required to make this as well.|$|E
50|$|The FZ750 uses a {{six-speed}} sequential close ratio gearbox; {{the gear}} shafts are only removable by splitting the crankcase halves.The clutch {{is of the}} wet, multi-plate type and is hydraulically operated. Final drive is by O-ring <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets.</b> A safety feature of the FZ750 is that the engine ignition is cut if first gear is selected with the sidestand down; this is commonplace on modern motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|The {{first version}} of the {{mechanism}} has a chain around two sprockets on which are mounted bending rollers. Each bending roller {{is attached to a}} cam which rides along another inclined face to move the roller along the protruding surface of the cane to complete bending it around the die.

5000|$|When MTT {{president}} Ted Mclntyre {{decided to}} add a motorcycle to his firm's range, he appointed Christian Travert, a former bike racer and custom builder, to head the project. Early models were powered by a Rolls-Royce-Allison Model 250-C18 gas turbine producing a claimed [...] at 52,000 rpm. Unlike some turbojet-powered motorcycles which relied on jet propulsion for thrust, the Y2K Superbike's turboshaft engine drives the rear wheel via a two-speed gearbox and <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket.</b> The motorcycles are produced on demand and made to order for buyers.|$|E
50|$|In November 2007, the G450X sport enduro {{motorcycle}} {{was launched}} using a 450 cc single-cylinder engine. The G450X contained several technological improvements over the Japanese off-road racing motorcycles {{but the most}} unusual and significant {{was the use of}} a single pivot point for the drive sprocket and the swing arm. This unusual configuration allowed for a very tense drive chain with no slop and eliminated acceleration squat. The former benefit saves on <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket</b> wear and the latter allows for a more consistent drive geometry and fully available rear suspension travel during heavy acceleration.|$|E
5000|$|Scott in 1903 used a <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket</b> {{drive to}} connect a tractor to other devices, an early example of {{versatility}} in this area. In 1904 at Perth a demonstration was held of three practical farming tasks, with a Scott motor and an Ivel motor designed by Dan Albone. In 1905 the Scientific American Supplement carried an article [...] "The Scott Gasoline-Motor-Propelled Agricultural Tractor".

50|$|The James Deluxe Autocycle was {{manufactured}} from 1946-49 {{and has a}} 50 x 50 mm engine {{fed with}} a Villiers Junior carburettor and driven by one gear and a clutch. The frame was a single downtube and rigid frame. The front fork is a central undamped spring. Original tyres were Dunlop Carrier 26 inch by 2 inch (oversized) and rims are Dunlop WMO 36 hole in a silver argenized color. The drive train was <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket.</b> Braking was through front and rear four inch drum brakes. Lighting provided by a six volt lamp {{on the front and}} four volt for the tail light.|$|E
50|$|In other words, {{conventional}} {{roller chain}} drives suffer {{the potential for}} vibration, as the effective radius of action in a <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket</b> combination constantly changes during revolution ("Chordal action"). If the chain moves at constant speed, then the shafts must accelerate and decelerate constantly. If one sprocket rotates at a constant speed, then the chain (and probably all other sprockets that it drives) must accelerate and decelerate constantly. This is usually not an issue with many drive systems; however, most motorcycles are fitted with a rubber bushed rear wheel hub to virtually eliminate this vibration issue. Toothed belt drives are designed to avoid this issue by operating at a constant pitch radius.|$|E
50|$|Chain drive uses {{sprockets}} and {{a roller}} chain, which requires both lubrication and adjustment for elongation (stretch) that occurs through wear. The lubricant {{is subject to}} being thrown off the fast-moving chain and results in grime and dirt build up. Chains do deteriorate, and excessive wear {{on the front and}} rear sprockets can be dangerous. In a chain drive the power is transmitted into the real wheel via a cush drive. Conventional roller chain drives suffer the potential for vibration, as the effective radius of action in a <b>chain</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprocket</b> combination constantly changes during revolution ("chordal action"). If a drive sprocket rotates at constant RPM, then the chain (and the driven sprocket) must accelerate and decelerate constantly. Most chain-driven motorcycles are fitted with a rubber bushed rear wheel hub to eliminate this vibration issue.|$|E
40|$|The SKITTER 2 {{design is}} a {{monocoque}} {{version of the}} proposed lunar three-legged walker. By the definition of monocoque, the body and legs are a shell with no internal ribbing or supports added for absorbing stresses. The purpose of the monocoque is to encase the elements used for power transmission, power supply, {{and control of the}} motion. The material for the structure is a vinyl ester resin, Derakane 8084. This material is easily formable and locally obtainable. The body consists of a hexagonally shaped cylinder with truncated hexagonal pyramids on the top and botton. The legs are eight inch diameter cylinders. The legs are comprised of a tibia section and a femur section. The SKITTER 2 is powered by six actuators which provide linear forces that are transformed into rotary torques by a series of <b>chains</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets.</b> The joints connect the femur to the body and the tibia to the femur. Surrounding the joints are flexible rubber hoses that fully encase the <b>chains</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets.</b> The SKITTER 2 is capable of walking upside down, righting itself after being overturned, and has the ability to perform in many environments. Applications for this walker include lunar transport or drilling, undersea exploration, and operation in severe surroundings such as arctic temperatures or high radiation...|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} started by late Indian {{motorsport}} legend S. Karivardhan in the 1980s in Coimbatore as an automobile racing team. During his years, the outfit initially operated as a Racecar Team. From 1988 to 1995 the team also entered Formula 3 with TOM'S Toyota and Dallara Mugen Honda for the annual Madras Grand Prix races. In 1995 Super Speeds entered into an agreement with JK Tyres to establish their Rally team and also provide technical assistance to establish their Racing activities. Later after Karivardhan's demise in 1995, the company was purchased by LGB, the makers of Rolon <b>chains</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprockets</b> <b>and</b> {{was turned into a}} race car construction company. Today the company is headed by B. Vijay Kumar. Till 2003 the company was also engaged into various trading activities related to automotive and engineering.|$|R
