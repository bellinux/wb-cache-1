50|$|Many genetic {{conditions}} {{are associated with}} macrocephaly, including familial macrocephaly related to the holgate gene, autism, PTEN mutations such as Cowden disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, and tuberous sclerosis; overgrowth syndromes such as Sotos syndrome (<b>cerebral</b> <b>gigantism),</b> Weaver syndrome, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (bulldog syndrome), and macrocephaly-capillary malformation (M-CMTC) syndrome; neurocardiofacial-cutaneous syndromes such as Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, Gorlin Syndrome, (also known as Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome) and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome; Fragile X syndrome; leukodystrophies (brain white matter degeneration) such as Alexander disease, Canavan disease, and megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts; and glutaric aciduria type 1 and D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria.|$|E
50|$|Sotos {{syndrome}} (<b>cerebral</b> <b>gigantism</b> or Sotos-Dodge syndrome) {{is a rare}} {{genetic disorder}} characterized by excessive physical growth during {{the first years of}} life. Excessive growth often starts in infancy and continues into the early teen years. The disorder may be accompanied by autism, mild intellectual disability, delayed motor, cognitive, and social development, hypotonia (low muscle tone), and speech impairments. Children with Sotos syndrome tend to be large at birth and are often taller, heavier, and have relatively large skulls (macrocephaly) than is normal for their age. Signs of the disorder, which vary among individuals, include a disproportionately large skull with a slightly protrusive forehead, large hands and feet, large mandible, hypertelorism (an abnormally increased distance between the eyes)(large inter-pupillary distance), and downslanting eyes. Clumsiness, an awkward gait, and unusual aggressiveness or irritability may also occur. Although most cases of Sotos syndrome occur sporadically, familial cases have also been reported. It is similar to Weaver syndrome.|$|E
40|$|The {{psychological}} {{functioning of}} three children with <b>cerebral</b> <b>gigantism</b> was explored, and similarities in intellectual, behavioral, and educational characteristics were found. The children showed a marked unevenness in their intellectual development, perseverative responding, word-finding problems, psychomotor slowness, and concrete thinking. All had well-developed reading skills but impairments in arithmetic reasoning and computation. The authors raise the possibility that children with <b>cerebral</b> <b>gigantism</b> may be easily misidentified as mentally retarded on routine psychometric evaluation. Abo, the educational aspects of this syndrome may be quite complex and of considerable importance in the planning for these children. <b>Cerebral</b> <b>gigantism</b> was first described by Sotos, Dodge, Muirhead, Crawford and Talbot (1964) as a condition charac-terized in early childhood by "excessively rapid growth, acromegalic features, and a non-progressive cerebral disorder with mental retardation. " Over 100 cases of <b>cerebral</b> <b>gigantism</b> have been reported since this initial description of the syndrome. Jaekin, van der Schueren-Lodeweyckz, and Eeckela (1972). {{in a review of}} 80 cases, described the most frequent clinical findings as gigantism (100 percent), prominent forehead (96 percent), high-arched palate (96 percent), hyperteleorism (91 percent), elongated head (84 percent), developmental retardation (83 percent), large hands and feet (83 percent), pointed chin (83 percent), advanced bone age (74 percent), lack of fine-motor control (67 percent), and neonatal adaptation and/or feeding problems (44 percent). In a more recent review, Sotos, Cutler, and Dodge (1977) described the rapid growth in <b>cerebral</b> <b>gigantism</b> as occurring primarily in in-fancy and early childhood, with a marked slowing down in the rate thereafter. As adults, persons with earlier indications of this syn-drome are presumed to be of near normal stature. The demon-stration of unusual dermatoglyphic patterning (Milunsky, Cowie, & Donoghue, 1967) suggested a pathological mechanism operative in utero or at conception. More recently, there has been some evidence for a dominant mode of inheritance (Zonana, Sotos, Rom...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{report a}} case of a 4 -year-old female with Sotos {{syndrome}} (<b>cerebral</b> <b>gigantism)</b> whose initial clinical, pathologic, and imaging presentation was considered suspicious for a vascular malformation of her left thigh. Following 17 months of attempted treatment, excision of the supposed vascular malformation was performed. Pathology tests revealed high-grade sarcoma. The delay of diagnosis resulted in an above-the-knee amputation for definitive treatment. If this etiology had been considered earlier in this patient’s clinical course, her treatment could have commenced sooner, and amputation of her leg may have been avoided. While soft-tissue sarcoma arising in childhood is rare, malignancy should be given consideration when evaluating a mass in a young child with characteristic physical examination findings of Sotos syndrome, since these children have an elevated risk of malignancy over the general population...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSotos {{syndrome}} (<b>Cerebral</b> <b>Gigantism)</b> a rare {{genetic disorder}} is usually characterized by macrocephaly and typical facial gestalt. There is {{a spectrum of}} behavioral and cognitive problems associated with it. We present a case of 11 -year-old boy who presented with co-ordination issues, academic difficulties along with host of behavioral problems. On examination {{he was tall and}} had macrocephaly with typical facial gestalt. His educational assessment revealed the presence of developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD) which was confirmed by Bruininks Otseretsky Motor Proficiency (BOTMP) and developmental co-ordination disorder questionnaire (DCD – 2007). On further assessment he also had an element of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) for which he was started on methylphenidate. In view of presence of both ADHD and DCD we used a multipronged approach while treating him; both medical and behavioral therapies were used. Although Sotos syndrome is well described in literature and known to be associated with several behavioral disorders, we couldn't find any previously reported association with DCD...|$|E
40|$|Sotos {{syndrome}} (SS) or <b>cerebral</b> <b>gigantism</b> (OMIM* 117550) is characterised by excessive growth, advancedbone age, typical facial gestalt, {{and developmental}} delay. 1 2 In infancy growth is rapid, but settles down above the> 97 th centile {{in early childhood}} 3 4 and tends to follow this during childhood. The adult height remains close to normal. 4 The hands and feet are large. The facial gestalt is very charac-teristic during childhood with macrocephaly (> 97 th centile), frontal bossing, prognathism, hypertelorism, and antimongol-oid slant of the palpebral fissures. With increasing age, the face gradually lengthens, the jaw becomes more prominent, and macrocephaly is no longer pronounced. 5 6 Neurological features are variable and include hypotonia and delay inmotor and language development, with a tendency for improvement with age. 1 2 5 – 9 Familial SS is rare. Only 17 families have been reported, most of which show an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. 5 6 10 – 19 Recent advances have shown a molecular genetic basis fo...|$|E
40|$|In many {{congenital}} malformation syndromes {{the pattern of}} hand-wrist development does not fit the sequence pictured in the Greulich-Pyle atlas. Not infrequently, {{there is a difference}} in maturation level of carpal and phalangeal centers in excess of that found in clinically normal children. Usually, the carpal centers are less developed than the phalangeal centers, whereas overall skeletal maturation is retarded (as in trisomy 18) or advanced (as in <b>cerebral</b> <b>gigantism).</b> In still other conditions, specific carpal centers are disproportionately delayed. By way of example, the capitate is differentially delayed in epiphyseal dysplasia, the lunate in homocystinuria, and the scaphoid in Fanconi's anemia and other radial hypoplasia syndromes. Side to side (i. e., bilateral) asymmetries may also occur in the developing hand, as in paralysis, in conditions involving increased local vascularity (as in hemangioma and rheumatoid arthritis) or in conditions associated with decreased vascularity. In the presence of excessive dysharmonic development or major bilateral asymmetry, with or without agenesis of one or more hand bones, assigning meaningful bone ages in {{congenital malformation}} syndromes becomes difficult. On the other hand, the degree and pattern of dysharmonic maturation may be helpful in diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Sotos {{syndrome}} {{is caused by}} a gene deletion with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. <b>Cerebral</b> <b>gigantism,</b> hypotonia and joint hyperextensibility are characteristic features of this syndrome. A percentage of these patients develop progressive scoliosis early in life. In the literature, few studies on the evolution of scoliosis in Sotos syndrome have been published. We retrospectively evaluated eight patients diagnosed with Sotos syndrome and scoliosis treated at the Garrahan Children Hospital between 1988 and March 2009. Clinical charts and imaging studies were assessed. Eight patients (19 %) presented with scoliosis and seven of them (87. 5 %) required surgical treatment. The mean follow-up was 9. 5  years (range 3 – 18). Mean age at first consultation was 5. 2  years (range 1. 1 – 11. 2). Mean Cobb angle for scoliosis at first consultation was 34. 3 ° (range 20 °– 42 °) and the mean Cobb angle for kyphosis was 45. 6 ° (range 30 °– 90 °). Mean age at surgery was 11. 2  years (range 3. 7 – 18. 10). The surgical procedures performed were instrumented posterior arthrodesis, alone or combined with anterior arthrodesis, instrumented anterior arthrodesis, while one patient is currently in treatment with growing rods. Preoperative mean Cobb angle for scoliosis was 72. 3 ° (range 54 °– 130 °) and for kyphosis was 59. 8 ° (range 30 °– 108 °); postoperative mean Cobb angle for scoliosis was 45. 5 ° (range 6 °– 90 °) and for kyphosis was 40. 2 ° (range 30 °– 80 °). There were three early complications (pleural effusion in two cases and death due to sepsis in one) and two late complications (kyphosis above the instrumentation area and dislodgement of the proximal hooks). Incidence of scoliosis in Sotos {{syndrome is}} high and thus close monitoring of patients with Sotos syndrome during growth is important for early detection of this entity. Joint hyperextensibility and hypotonia that are characteristic of the syndrome should be considered at the moment of surgery to avoid short fusions...|$|E
