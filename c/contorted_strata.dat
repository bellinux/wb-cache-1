60|$|The Cumbre, {{where the}} road crosses it, is, {{according}} to Mr. Pentland, 12,454 feet above the sea; and the neighbouring peaks, composed of dark purple and whitish porphyries, some obscurely stratified with a westerly dip, and others {{without a trace of}} stratification, must exceed 13,000 feet in height. Descending the eastern slope of the Cumbre, the structure becomes very complicated, and generally differs on {{the two sides of the}} east and west line of road and section. First we come to a great mass [A] of nearly vertical, singularly <b>contorted</b> <b>strata,</b> composed of highly compact red sandstones, and of often calcareous conglomerates, and penetrated by green, yellow, and reddish dikes; but I shall presently have an opportunity of describing in some detail an analogous pile of strata. These vertical beds are abruptly succeeded by others [B], of apparently nearly the same nature but more metamorphosed, alternating with porphyries and limestones; these dip for a short space westward, but there has been here an extraordinary dislocation, which, on the north side of the road, appears to have determined the excavation of the north and south valley of the R. de las Cuevas. On this northern side of the road, the strata [B] are prolonged till they come in close contact with a jagged lofty mountain [D] of dark- coloured, unstratified, intrusive porphyry, where the beds have been more highly inclined and still more metamorphosed. This mountain of porphyry seems to form a short axis of elevation, for south of the road in its line there is a hill [C] of porphyritic conglomerate with absolutely vertical strata.|$|E
50|$|Thomas Andrew Walker (15 October 1828 - 25 November 1889) was an English civil {{engineering}} contractor. Walker {{was born at}} Brewood in Staffordshire. He was educated at King's College London. After {{his work on the}} Grand Trunk Railway of Canada in 1852 and extensive surveys in Russia, Egypt and Sudan, in years 1863-1865, he was offered, and accepted, the management of the construction of the District Railway in London. He was then entrusted with the still more difficult work of completing the Severn Tunnel at the request of Sir John Hawkshaw. Thomas A. Walker was engaged for seven years in the construction of this tunnel. When he began work on the project he had already accumulated considerable experience in railway survey and construction throughout Canada, Russia, Egypt and England. In writing his memoirs of his work on the Severn Tunnel he states: 'Sub-aqueous tunnels have recently become quite the fashion. One such experience as the Severn Tunnel, with its ever-varying and strangely <b>contorted</b> <b>strata,</b> and the dangers from floods above and floods below, has been sufficient for me. One sub-aqueous tunnel is quite enough for a lifetime.'.' The tunnel was completed in 1887, having a length of 4 miles 628 yards (7668 yard m). Other works that he undertook were the Barry Dock and Railway, and the Preston Dock, and in addition he carried out the contract for the Buenos Aires Harbour Works with John Hawkshaw and resident engineer James Murray Dobson.|$|E
40|$|The early {{quest for}} liberty and {{political}} freedom in South Africa had {{been influenced by}} various factors, inter alia political sentiments which originated in Reformed, Huguenot and Patriotten political theory. An analysis of early political ideas indicates that religious sentiments had a significant influence {{on the development of}} political ideas. These sentiments and ideas all contributed to a passionate search for freedom, justice and democracy. The different strata of religious and political ideas manifest in a continuous and discontinuous way, giving the impression of fragmented and contorted ideas, but still recognisable in terms of their origins. This contribution is an attempt to identify some of the fragmented and <b>contorted</b> <b>strata</b> of ideas which influenced the early quest for political freedom and the rejection of British colonial rule in South Africa.

50|$|The coast between Boscastle and Widemouth is characterised by high slumped cliffs {{leading to}} areas of thickly vegetated, sloping lower undercliffs. The {{underlying}} rock, {{a type of}} shale which is easily fractured, is known to geologists as the Crackington formation and the layered <b>strata</b> <b>contorted</b> by earth movements can best be seen at Crackington Haven and Millook. The rocks date to the Namurian stage roughly 326 to 313 Ma (million years ago) and were folded during the Variscan orogeny a period of mountain building caused by the collision of two continents.|$|R
60|$|It {{would hardly}} be fair to leave Madeira without a visit to Machico, the scene of Machim's {{apocryphal}} death. The realists derive the name from Algarvan Monchique. I have made it on foot, on horseback, and by boat, but never so comfortably as when on board the steam-tug Falcão. Garajáo, whose ruddy rocks of volcanic tufa, embedding bits of lava, probably entitled it 'Brazenhead,' is worth inspecting from the sea. Possibly the classic term 'Purple Islands' may have arisen from the fiery red hue of the volcanic cliffs seen at the sunset hour. Like Girão, the middle block of Tern Point is horizontally stratified, while the western abutment slopes to the water. Eastward, however, there has been immense degradation; half the dome has been shaken down and washed away; while a succession of upheavals and earthquakes has <b>contorted</b> the <b>strata</b> in the strangest manner. Seen from Funchal, the profile of Garajáo is that of an elephant's head, the mahaut sitting behind it {{in the shape of}} a red-brown boss, the expanded head of a double dyke seaming the tufas of the eastern face. We distinguish on the brow two 'dragons,' puny descendants of the aboriginal monsters. Beyond Garajáo the shore falls flat, and the upland soil is red as that of Devonshire. It is broken by the Ponta da Oliveira, where there is ne'er an olive-tree, and by the grim ravine of Porto de Caniço o Bispo, the 'bishop' being a basaltic pillar with mitre and pontifical robes sitting in a cave of the same material. I find a better episkopos at Ponta da Atalaia, 'Sentinel Point.' Head, profile, and shoulders are well defined; the hands rest upon the knees, and the plaited folds of the dress are well expressed by the basaltic columns of the central upheaval. Beyond Porto Novo do Cal, with its old fort and its limekiln, is the chapel of São Pedro, famous for its romeiro, 'pattern' or pilgrimage for St. Peter's Day. June 29 is kept even at Funchal by water-excursions; it is homage enough to pay a penny and to go round the ships.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} conception of deserts as places almost barren of life, the geologic record {{shows that the}} tracks and traces of animals are often associated with desert deposits. The reluctance of some geologists to associate such tracks with eolian deposits has even led some {{to conclude that the}} tracks, and therefore the rocks, were formed under water. Eolian sandstones showing the tracks of vertebrate animals range from Carboniferous to Holocene in age and include such famous formations as the Coconino and Navajo sandstones of the United States, the Botucatu Sandstone of Brazil, and the Cave Sandstone of southern Africa. Three eolian sandstone formations from the Permian of Scotland have tracks believed to have been made by pelycosaurs, anomodonts, and pareiasaurs. A study of these formations has helped in interpreting how such tracks in eolian sandstones were formed and preserved. Two of these formations occur in isolated basins in Dumfries and Galloway, where the tracks occur on the surface of very thin, clay-rich, silt laminae probably deposited following a storm or small-flood event. The tracks from a third formation in Grampian are closely associated with sheetflood deposits and <b>contorted</b> <b>strata,</b> both believed to indicate the presence of water. Sufficient water was therefore present in both areas to give the sand the degree of cohesion necessary for track formation and preservation...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{characterization of}} Mass-Transport Deposits or MTDs, {{in terms of}} emplacement processes, depositional products, structural properties and internal architecture, is crucial to define the hydraulic properties of slope-to-basinal deposits. In fact, MTDs are distinct mechanical units and significant heterogeneities within sedimentary succession. They may show different fractures parameters, including intensity and orientation of fractures, when compared to underlying and overlying undeformed strata. MTDs can therefore {{play a significant role}} in hydrocarbon exploration and production, inasmuch as they may act as barriers or conduits for fluid flow in the subsurface. The Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous basinal Maiolica Formation exposed in the Gargano Promontory (southern Italy) represents an ideal natural laboratory to study the stratigraphic architecture of ancient MTDs. This formation consists of undisturbed intervals of flat-lying, light coloured, thin-bedded, cherty micritic limestone interbedded with chaotic intervals characterized by extensively folded and <b>contorted</b> <b>strata</b> of similar facies. The stratigraphic thickness of these deformed strata, which are interpreted to be slump/slide deposits and, to a lesser extent, debris-flow deposits, varies from several decimetres to tens of metres. The internal deformation comprises down-slope verging soft-sediment folds, and both normal and reverse faults. Normal faults are most common in the updip portion of the MTDs, whereas reverse faults are best developed toward their frontal margins, where they often form imbricates of multiple thrusts. In several places, the studied MTDs exhibit signs of reworking, as demonstrated by reactivation of the slump related faults resulting in deformation of beds overlying the MTDs. The structural properties and the distribution of studied MTDs are discussed in the context of the Cretaceous tectonics of the Gargano Promontory, as well as on the characteristics of the paleoslope of the Apulian Platform...|$|E
