50|$|Geography is a {{systematic}} {{study of the}} Earth and its features. Traditionally, geography {{has been associated with}} cartography and place names. Although many geographers are trained in toponymy and <b>cartology,</b> this is not their main preoccupation. Geographers study the space and the temporal database distribution of phenomena, processes, and features as well as the interaction of humans and their environment. Because space and place affect a variety of topics, such as economics, health, climate, plants and animals, geography is highly interdisciplinary. The interdisciplinary nature of the geographical approach depends on an attentiveness to the relationship between physical and human phenomena and its spatial patterns.|$|E
5000|$|Melbourne, Australia, {{held its}} inaugural White Night festival on 23 February 2013. An {{estimated}} crowd {{of more than}} 300,000 people attended. The second, on 22 February 2014 drew an estimated 500,000 people. The third White Night in 2015, expanded the festival to more venues and locations, including Scots' Church where digital artist Alinta Krauth debuted her Colonise 3-D projection artwork exploring Australia's relationship with bats, and again in 2016 with her <b>Cartology</b> Apology, {{called one of the}} [...] "gems of the night". [...] Open from 7pm to 7am the following morning, the event featured music, dance, visual display, light show, and a variety of buskers. Art institutions such as the National Gallery of Victoria and the Australian Centre for the Moving Image featured free exhibitions and films for the public to attend. The fourth White Night, held on 20 February 2016 attracted an estimated 580,000 people. The 2017 event took place on 17 February.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt {{is often}} {{necessary}} to measure characteristics of map feature in maps. The characteristics contains coordinate, angle, length, distance, area, cubage, slope, density, gradient and intensity, etc [...] Aiming at problem of difficulty for 3 D measure maps elements in ordinarily electronic maps, {{the idea of}} electronic maps based on DEM is brought forward. The maps make 3 D DEM and 2 D electronic maps to vertically integrate, and {{to take advantage of}} each other, and to advance spatial representing map measure ability of electronic maps, and to strengthen application potential of DEM. Method of vertically integrating grid DEM and electronic maps is researched, and 3 D measure models of electronic maps based on grid DEM is studied. The powerful data processing ability of computer has created excellent conditions for application of model methods. It is an important aspect of <b>cartology</b> study to establish and apply good model. That can promote accuracy and speed of map measure, can promote the application of depth analysis of maps information and can exert the benefit of maps better...|$|E
