This new guarantee is referred to as ε-admissible.|$|E
25|$|According to {{lawyer and}} human rights activist K. Balagopal, Kashmiris have a {{distinct}} sense of identity and this identity is certainly not irreligious, as Islam {{is very much a}} part of the identity that Kashmiris feel strongly for. He opined that if only non-religious identities deserve support, then no national self-determination movement can be supported, because there is no national identity – at least in the Third World – devoid of the religious dimension. Balagopal says that if India and Pakistan cannot guarantee existence and peaceful development of independent Kashmir then Kashmiris may well choose Pakistan because of religious affinity and social and economic links. But if both <b>can</b> <b>guarantee</b> existence and peaceful development then most Kashmiris would prefer independent Kashmir.|$|E
25|$|Acting {{as if he}} is {{not bothered}} by Dr. Lee exiling him, Devon {{contacts}} A's rival school Morris Brown College, to discuss playing for their marching band next season. Mr. Wade, Brown's band leader, says that Devon does not {{need to know how to}} read music and will likely get a full scholarship and a good position on the drumline. When Wade wants to know what Dr. Lee is planning for the BET Big Southern Classic (a large competition of college bands), Devon realizes that his heart and honor are still with the A band. He rejects the scholarship offer from the rival band and returns to A Though Devon is still not playing for the band, he cannot give up his drumming. He is sent cassette tapes from his estranged father and gets some ideas for new drum arrangements. He and Sean have a final confrontation, with Sean telling Devon that he is A's best drummer but that the band is bigger than just one person; this clears the air and they begin to work together. The two present their idea for an entrance cadence to Dr. Lee who decides they will be used during the Classic. Devon helps the drumline prepare and patches up his relationship with Laila. Lee also tells Devon that he <b>can</b> <b>guarantee</b> him a full return to the band next year.|$|E

500|$|After Sonnen's {{win over}} Nate Marquardt in early 2010, Sonnen became a {{polarizing}} figure {{due to his}} criticism of Silva and overall trash talk (including comments directed towards Silva's manager, teammates, coaches, wife and home country of Brazil). Silva remained relatively quiet until a UFC 148 media call in June 2012, when he stated through an interpreter: [...] "Chael Sonnen's {{going to get his}} ass kicked like he's never gotten his ass kicked before. What I'm going to do inside the Octagon is something that's going to change the image of the sport. This is going to be violent and I am sorry.

500|$|The {{importance}} {{of law in}} the struggle against corruption has been emphasised since the early 1980s. Deng pointed out in 1980 that the anti-corruption effort was a political struggle which, to be successful, must be fought in an institutional environment. At the 4th Plenary Session of the 15th CCDI in 2000, Jiang drew a similar conclusion: [...] "The {{most important thing is to}} uphold and improve a system of institutions which <b>can</b> <b>guarantee</b> the Party’s strong leadership and socialist prosperity, and make sure that the system is functioning by means of laws, regulations, policies and education." [...] Despite this, until the 16th National Congress the CPC's anti-corruption system was based on campaign-style events rather than formal procedures (partially due to the 1940s Yan'an Rectification Movement and its legacy). The idea that campaigns – not institutions – were the best weapon against corruption predominated under Deng, and is best seen in the establishment of the Central Party Rectification Steering Committee during the 1980s. This was the CPC central leadership's preferred way to combat corruption, since its enforcement depended largely on the leadership. However, the sharp increase in corrupt activities during the 1990s led the Party to change course.|$|E

2500|$|When the {{aircraft}} was 6.5nm {{north of the}} Machrihanish (MAC) VOR (a type of radio navigational beacon near Campbeltown Airport), the pilot requested descent clearance.

This was the altitude needed to enter the airport's landing pattern, but the descent wasn't required until the aircraft was over the MAC VOR.

2500|$|Optimal {{control is}} a {{particular}} control technique in which the control signal optimizes a certain [...] "cost index": for example, {{in the case of}} a satellite, the jet thrusts needed to bring it to desired trajectory that consume the least amount of fuel.

Together with PID controllers, MPC systems are the most widely used control technique in process control.|$|E
