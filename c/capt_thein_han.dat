5000|$|<b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> (painter) (သိန်းဟန်, 1910-1986) {{was a major}} Yangon {{painter of}} the post-World War II era who {{produced}} a number of memorable works and who had an abiding influence {{on the evolution of}} the more conservative painting styles in Burma in the decades that followed. He {{should not be confused with}} <b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> the writer and art critic, who is often quoted for his article written on Burmese painting published in the Atlantic Monthly in 1958.|$|R
50|$|<b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> {{was not a}} zealously {{prolific}} painter, yet {{a number}} of his works are famous in Burma, particularly three oil paintings: She of his wife, Artist U Ba Nyan (1950), and a well-known self-portrait entitled Artist U <b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> (1972). All three works appear in a softback publication entitled The Great Master Myanmar Artist U Thein Han’s Descendant U Lun Gywe. The book includes 30 of Thein Han’s works and 30 by the contemporary painter Lun Gywe, one of his students.|$|R
50|$|When <b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> was in {{the tenth}} grade of {{secondary}} school, he encountered the work of Ba Nyan through an elder brother who knew Ba Nyan. From that point forward, he became obsessed with the art of painting and asked his parents {{to send him to}} art school but was turned down. Thus, he ran away from home to Yangon, where he stayed at U Ahdissawunssa’s monastery, where a cousin was studying Buddhistic studies. This cousin, U Pandisa, introduced him to Ba Nyan and Ba Nyan accepted him as an apprentice. His birth name had been Maung Sit and Ba Nyan gave him the new name of <b>Thein</b> <b>Han.</b>|$|R
50|$|In addition, the {{following}} are included in {{one or both of}} the other two editions: the Burmese Chatthasangayana edition (a list of contents can be found in <b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> 1981) and the Sinhalese Simon Hewavitarne Bequest edition.|$|R
50|$|<b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> {{was one of}} the six {{original}} apprentices {{who lived}} with and studied under Ba Nyan after Ba Nyan returned from his art studies in London in 1930. Three of these apprentices became major painters in Burma and <b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> {{was one of the}}m. Other painters such as Ngwe Gaing and Kyaw Hlaing had spent long periods studying with Ba Nyan but not as a live-in apprentices at his home. In Burma, there is a certain sentimental attachment to those painters who studied under Ba Nyan as full-fledged apprentices, perhaps because this training was reminiscent of the training painters of the Traditional School had received as far as memory could recall.|$|R
50|$|While {{a teacher}} at the Rangoon School of Fine Arts and after his retirement, <b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> often invited {{students}} to his home for lessons. After retirement he volunteered to teach for the Yangon University Art Club, and had classes at his home twice a week. In the history of Burmese painting pedagogy, <b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> is a transitional figure in many ways. His own instruction came entirely through his apprenticeship with Ba Nyan, but he later became an instructor in a government school where his exposure to students was wide and not always intimate. Yet he tried to retain the intimacy of the old apprenticeship system by inviting students to his home to learn.|$|R
50|$|<b>Thein</b> <b>Han,</b> however, {{spent an}} unusual nine years {{studying}} with Ba Nyan and never rebelled against his style and thus remained a realist and naturalist throughout his painting career. For this reason, he was {{sometimes referred to}} as the “second U Ba Nyan” in Burma, a sobriquet that was not necessarily flattering.|$|R
50|$|Like Ba Nyan, some of Thein Han's best {{works are}} portraits, {{but he also}} did landscapes and still life. His son, Han Htut, has written an {{unpublished}} article on his father’s history, entitled “Artist U <b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> (1910-1986)” which lists 16 of his most important oil works. But perhaps three score or more works are undocumented.|$|R

50|$|The Akademi's second International Seminar in 1975 {{was also}} held in New Delhi {{and focused on}} the Ramayana Tradition in Asia. Participants, {{including}} U <b>Thein</b> <b>Han,</b> Soewito Santoso, Harry M. Buck, C.E. Godakumbra, Kapila Vatsyayan, Camille Bulke and Umashankar Joshi presented forty-four papers on Ramayana traditions, which were then published by the Akademi in a commemorative volume. A second International seminar on the same theme was held in New Delhi in 1981.|$|R
5000|$|Zawgyi (ဇော်ဂျီ, born <b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> ( [...] , [...] ); 12 April 1907 - 26 September 1990) was a {{distinguished}} and leading Burmese poet, author, literary historian, critic, scholar and academic. He {{was one of}} the leaders of the Hkit san (Testing the Times) movement in Burmese literature searching for a new style and content before the Second World War, along with Theippan Maung Wa, Nwe Soe and Min Thu Wun. His first hkit san poetry,Padauk pan (Padauk flower), was published in Hantha Kyemon pamphlet.|$|R
50|$|He {{studied in}} China in 1964, and {{was awarded a}} {{fellowship}} in art restoration to East Germany in 1971. His year-long stay in China had a strong influence, and he incorporated the Chinese brush and ink techniques into his oils and watercolors. The course in east Germany let him study European masters in East Berlin, Dresden and Potsdam and confirmed his love of impressionism. However, his greatest influence has probably been <b>Thein</b> <b>Han,</b> under whom he studied and with whom he retained a close relationship in his later life.|$|R
50|$|Ngwe Gaing is {{considered}} one of the great masters of modern Burmese painting. He made an outstanding contribution through his versatility, technical skill and influence on a generation of Burmese painters. In the post-WWII years, many painters sought instruction from Ngwe Gaing, packing his studio to watch him work, just as painters had flocked to Ba Nyan in the pre-war years. Among the painters influenced by Ngwe Gaing were Myat Kyaw, San Win, Hla Shein, Ko Lay, Hla Maung Gyi, Nann Wai, <b>Thein,</b> <b>Han</b> Tin, San Pe, M. Tin Aye, and Lun Gywe.|$|R
50|$|Lun Gywe {{was born}} in Yangon, Myanmar on 24 October 1930, and was raised by his mother after his father {{died when he was}} five months old. From an early age he spent much of his time drawing. He studied under Thet Win, Chit Maung, San Win, <b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> (painter) and Ngwe Gaing, and {{graduated}} from the Art Institute of Teacher's Training in 1954. He was an instructor at the State School of Fine Arts, Yangon (1958-1979) and principal of this school (1977-1979). He also taught at the Fine Art association the University of Rangoon (1960-1979).|$|R
5000|$|Win Pe Myint (ဝင်းဖေမြင့်, born 1948) is a noted Burmese painter. In 1970, he {{graduated}} from Rangoon Arts and Sciences University with a Botany major. He was extremely interested in painting since childhood. He studied under 4 outstanding art masters: Lun Gywe, Shwe Oung Thame, Paw Oo Thet and <b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> (painter). He worked as an art teacher in Regional College - 3 from 1984 to 1986. He {{should not be confused}} with the earlier Burmese painter Win Pe of Mandalay, born in 1936, who was a contemporary of Paw Oo Thet, and one of the early founders of modernist painting in Burma.|$|R

50|$|Ba Nyan {{played a}} key role in {{introducing}} western techniques to Myanmar artists. He also had a significant influence on the manner in which teaching was handed down in Burma for he retained the master-apprentice form of instruction, which had always been a feature of the older more Traditional schools of painting in Burma. Ba Nyan taught six pupils full-time who lived with him in his home: Aye Maung, <b>Thein</b> <b>Han,</b> <b>Thein</b> Tan, Myat Kyaw, Ba Kyi, and Aung Khin, in that order, although Myat Kyaw's period of study with Ba Nyan was short. As Myat Kyaw's interest in painting was in the commercial rather than fine-art vein, Ba Nyan sent Myat Kyaw for further study to Ngwe Gaing, whose interest in the early years was in commercial work. <b>Thein</b> <b>Han,</b> Ba Kyi, and Aung Khin became major painters of Burma, and Myat Kyaw, if not a major painter of Burma, became a major figure and force in the Burmese painting community. Ngwe Gaing and Bogalay Kyaw Hlaing studied with Ba Nyan on an ad hoc basis; but there is no question that Ngwe Gaing's three or four years of studying with Ba Nyan on weekends had a large influence on Ngwe Gaing, who became regarded as the leading painter in Burma after Ba Nyan died. Aung Soe also received some exposure to Ba Nyan while both of them were at the Institute of Art during the Japanese occupation period (above), but Aung Soe was very young then, barely 20, and their time together at the Academy was very short. As Aung Soe's path as an intensely modernist (abstract) painter, or as a painter in the Traditional mode, shows no clear influence of Ba Nyan, it is strictly speculation to wonder of the effects Ba Nyan may have had on Aung Soe.|$|R
50|$|Kyaw Hlaing {{was born}} on 28 September 1914 in Bogalay (in the present-day Ayeyarwady Region), son of wealthy parents with an {{interest}} in art. He studied art at Aid National Middle School. At the age of 18, with Ba Kyi, Aye Maung and <b>Thein</b> <b>Han,</b> he became a student under the master Ba Nyan, who had learned European oil painting techniques in London. After the Second World War he entered a national painting competition, winning prizes in the still life, figure and landscape categories, and the overall gold prize. He found work as an art instructor in Bogalay, later moving to Yangon where he taught in high schools for many years.|$|R
50|$|Prime Minister U Nu's anti-communist play The People Win Through (Ludu Aung Than in Burmese) {{was turned}} into a feature film in 1954, {{produced}} by Cascade Pictures of Hollywood, directed by George Seitz (Jr) and filmed on location in Burma. The English version of the screen script was written by Paul Gangelin, President of the Writers Guild of Hollywood. It was June Rose Bellamy (Yadana Nat Mai) who introduced Maung Maung Ta to the Hollywood team. The cast were Thukha, Bo Ba Kho, Hla Maung Glay, Mya Gyi, Maung Maung Ta, Bo Tauk Tun, <b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> Gyi, Bagyi, Ohn Mg, Hat Hat and Mai Tin. U Thukha, Maung Maung Ta and Hat Hat were alive till 2004. As of 2007, only Maung Maung Ta is alive.|$|R
50|$|Prior to World War II, <b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> took a {{position}} as a drawing teacher as Myin Chan High School in Central Burma. After the war, when the government opened up the Rangoon State School of Fine Arts in 1952, he joined the staff as an instructor of oil and watercolor painting, {{with an emphasis on}} color composition. He taught at the State School of Fine Arts until the age of 67. It was here at the State School of Fine Arts, that he left a large impact on the subsequent development of Burmese painting, passing down the techniques of realist and naturalist painting which he had learned from Ba Nyan. It must be said that his taste in painting was conservative, yet he also steeped Burmese painters in a solid, formal foundation of techniques.|$|R
50|$|San Win, born in 1905, and Ngwe Gaing, born in 1901, {{can be said}} to be contemporaries of Ba Nyan, born in 1897, who was {{the founder}} of what may be called the Rangoon School. Ba Nyan died early, in his late forties, and the mantle of {{instruction}} in the Rangoon School then passed to Ngwe Gaing, San Win, and <b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> (painter), who was one of Ba Nyan’s apprentices. A great many painters of the next generation listed San Win and Ngwe Gaing as their teachers on their resumes. Some of the painters that studied under San Win were Hla Baw, Tun Nyunt, Chit Tun, U Kyi, Kan Nyunt, Khin Maung (Yangon), Thu Ka, Nyan Shein (painter and art historian), Thein Nyunt, Lun Gywe, and Tun Sein.|$|R
50|$|Ba Kyi {{was born}} on 16 July 1912 in Kyaikhto, and took up {{painting}} at an early age. He attended Rangoon University where he gained an Intermediate of Science and a Teachers Certificate. Beginning in 1933, he apprenticed under the master Ba Nyan, who had studied western oil painting in London, England and who painted in a realist and naturalist style. His fellow students studying with Ba Nyan included Bogalay Kyaw Hlaing, Aye Maung and <b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> (painter). In 1939, when the State School of Art and Music opened, Ba Kyi became an art instructor there. Under the Japanese occupation during World War II, he was an art lecturer at the Institute of Art, which was organized by the Japanese. He designed currency notes, stamps and propaganda posters. After Myanmar regained independence, he painted huge theatre backdrops and drew many magazine covers and illustrations.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 5,000 people {{gathered}} to demonstrate in Mandalay. The military {{was reported to}} have put most monasteries under guard to prevent egress. People gathered at 80th, 84th, 35th, and 33rd Streets, before joining together; three military trucks followed them and tried to break up the demonstrators, arresting one student who attempted to cross the road in front of them. The military forced monks from outside Mandalay to return to their native towns, the military keeping the homes of NLD Party leaders under guard. Peaceful demonstrations were reported in Mandalay. The Ngwe Kyar Yan Monastery in South Okkalarpa which was subject to a raid some days earlier was under repair, some suggested, in an effort to eliminate evidence. A dedicated group of anti-riot troops {{was reported to have}} been formed within Brigate-77 led by Col. <b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> under Minister Aung Thaung and General Htay Oo's supervision. Agricultural Minister General Maung Oo and Minister of Information Brig. General Kyaw Hsan was said {{to be in charge of}} arresting monks at night.|$|R
5000|$|Lun Gywe {{has been}} {{described}} as the greatest living Burmese painter. Lun Gywe began painting in a realistic and naturalistic vein, influenced by the major painters of the Rangoon School, Ba Nyan, Ngwe Gaing, San Win, and <b>Thein</b> <b>Han</b> who was his painting master. Over time, his works became more impressionistic and some of the works today might be called expressionistic. His exposure to rapidly executed Chinese ink and watercolor painting during his trip to China seems to have influenced his impressionistic work as he paints quickly and he is extremely prolific. His impressionistic work has been called [...] "the action of impressionism". Of his Impressionist style, he has said, [...] "I paint according to my emotions, drawing inspiration from smell and textures, light and shadow" [...] An important part of his work focuses on the female form, his favourite subject.A strong believer in Buddhism, his work is unified by his devotion to the principles embodied in that religion of order, harmony, stability and grace. He has said [...] "I find inspiration in calmness. I cannot create a good painting when in an unsettled frame of mind. I often meditate before I start a painting".|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{his heavy}} {{responsibilities}} {{as a teacher}} and art official, San Win managed to produce a healthy amount of his work in his life, and he would be regarded by almost any scholar of 20th century Burmese painting {{as one of the top}} dozen or so painters of his time. He is particularly known for advancing impressionism in Burma. <b>Thein</b> <b>Han,</b> the writer, not the painter, said of him, [...] "In landscapes whose contrasts of light and shade sometimes recall the impressionism of Monet, and in occasional figures, U San Win has shown his mastery of the tonal values of color." [...] However, it should be emphasized that San Win introduced a form of impressionism that was unique to Burma, quite unlike European impressionism with it rich flushes of bold, often primary colors. The painting of Burma up to San Win’s time was filled by much more subdued and restrained displays of color, often dark and quite moody. In San Win’s work, the dominant colors are often light or shadowy dark blues, browns, greys and twinges of gold, with splotches of red, pink or yellow in the color of the longyi (the national dress) of small background figures, and often many of them, walking in paths towards temples. There are few landscape paintings by him where the spots of red in longyis do not appear and this can be called a signature element in his work. [...] The color yellow also appears more lightly in his skies but it is not overbearing.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an ecocritical {{analysis of the}} depiction of the aquatic environment in the poetic sequence The Hyacinth‘s Way (or Beida lan, comprising poems originally published separately in magazines between 1957 to 1981) by seminal Burmese writer Saya Zawgyi (born <b>Thein</b> <b>Han,</b> 1907 – 1990). The forty-poem sequence narrates the ebbs and flows of the feminized plant protagonist Ma Beda(or Miss Beda, a water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes) as she drifts along an unnamed waterway, in all probability the Pyapon River, {{a tributary of the}} Irrawaddy River in Myanmar. At various moments in the sequence, the narrative is conveyed in the first person, from Ma Beda‘s perspective as she relates experiences of exhilaration and triumph—while negotiating fatigue and physical obstacles, such as whirlpools and logs—in her passage up and down the river. Notwithstanding the sequence‘s prominent use of metaphor—principally, the alignment of the plant‘s journey to Buddhist ideas of being—The Hyacinth‘s Way, at the same time, demonstrates in-depth observational knowledge of riparian habitats, tidal rhythms, interactions between the species inhabiting the tidal ecosystem, ethnobotanical relationships between villagers and plants, and, arguably, the bioinvasive status of the hyacinth itself. Developing an ecocritical approach to contemporary Burmese poetry and applying concepts from the field of critical plant studies, the analysis characterizes The Hyacinth‘s Way as an environmental text positioning the natural world as a chief subject of concern. While offering a persuasive allegory for the contingencies of human life from a Buddhist perspective, the poem concurrently underscores the fragility of freshwater aquatic ecosystems in South-east Asia. The paper concludes that, through the compelling voice of Ma Beda, Zawgyi presents a message of river conservation and the value of engendering respectful attitudes toward waterways and their ecologies through the persuasiveness of poetic narratives...|$|R

She leaves her familial home and moves into West Berlin, drawn by {{the brightness of the}} high streets and the economic progress in the West German side of the city. She initially dates Lord (Uwe-Jens Pape), a wealthy, leather-jacket-wearing ladies man, highly conscious of his own self-image and style. He is strongly influenced by American movie heartthrobs of the times.|$|R
