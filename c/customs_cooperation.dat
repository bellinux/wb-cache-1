The European Council agreed to create [...] "a European police office (Europol) the initial function {{of which would be}} to organize exchange of information on narcotic drugs". The Council likewise instructed TREVI ministers to take measures in setting up the office. On 7 February 1992, Europol was enshrined with more substance in Article K.1, section 9, as the Maastricht Treaty was signed: Member States shall regard the following areas as matters of common interest: [...] police cooperation for the purposes of preventing and combatting terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of international crime, including if necessary certain aspects of <b>customs</b> <b>cooperation,</b> in connection with the organization of a Union-wide system for exchanging information within a European Police Office (Europol).Europol was first de facto organised provisionally in 1993 as the Europol Drugs Unit (EDU) in Strasbourg at the same site as the Schengen Information System was hosted. The small initial group started operations there in January 1994 under the leadership of Jürgen Storbeck and with a mandate to assist national police forces in criminal investigations. The competition for the permanent site of Europol during the period was between The Hague, Rome and Strasbourg—the European Council decided on 29 October 1993 that Europol should be established in The Hague. A former Catholic boys school built in 1910 at Raamweg 47 was chosen as the precise location. The house was used in World War II by police and intelligence agencies and after the War manned by the Dutch State Intelligence Service until Europol relocated there later in 1994.|$|E

40|$|The {{cooperative}} {{practices of}} private landowners, while critical to cross-boundary conservation, {{are not well}} understood. Based on research along the Rocky Mountain Front in Montana, we document the ways that established <b>customs</b> governing <b>cooperation</b> between ranchers meet both individual and community needs. While ranchers argued for landowner control of private property, in practice, rancher pro perty boundaries were permeable and contingent with regard to livelihood needs and certain community goods, such as hunting access to private lands. But changing landownership was causing conflict between neighbors and tension in local communi ties, because new landowners either inadvertently or intentionally challenged estab lished boundary practices. Efforts at cross-boundary conservation need to recognize the challenges of changing landownership and the ways that existing customs might provide important foundations for cooperation. At the same time, an increasingly diverse set of private landowners must negotiate mutually beneficial boundary prac tices that meet both existing and emerging community and conservation needs. Keywords amenity owners, community, cross-boundary conservation, land tenure, property rights, rural change Cross-boundary conservation in the American West is challenged by multiple ownerships and rapid change in landownership.

Therefore, since June 1990,Iran’s <b>custom</b> through <b>cooperation</b> with United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), United Nations Conference on Development Program (UNDP), and World Customs Organization (WCO), had tried to establish this system in Iran. In 1377 Hegira, by recognizing capabilities and attributes of ASYCUDA in equalizing and facilitating customs services, and increasing the efficacy of Iran’s customs, it is established in west Tehran customs and import section. ASYCUDA is a system for automatic processing of customs data which is a plan called NEGAR (acronym for automated system for customs data in Persian) in Iran. Then other parts like export, temporary admission, and temporary exportation, were performed in this customs as other sub plans of ASYCUDA. The aim {{of this research is}} to recognize obstacles in effective executing of ASYCUDA for increasing the speed of goods release, optimal exploitation of storehouses, better use of human force, developing usage culture for mechanized systems, gaining more income, and presenting in time, rapid, and exact statistics for foreign trades. This project is applicative by aim, but naturally, it is a surveying-descriptive project. We use some measures like frequency distribution, percentage, measures of central tendency, and measures of distribution, and statistical graphs in descriptive analysis. In inferential analysis, first by means of Kolmogrof Smirnov’s test, we examined the normality of data, and then by using T test we compare observed (practical) averages with theoretical one to decide about rejection or approval of each hypothesis individually. Finally, by using one-way analysis of variance, we compare the averages of four responding groups (Zanjan and Qazvin staffs, and clients of both of them) for every variable, and then with regard to research hypotheses, we compare these groups’ opinions. According to the obtained results, it is identified that in Zanjan and Qazvin customs the establishment of ASYCUDA has increased the speed of customs performance.

40|$|Because mutual {{recognition}} is now {{enshrined in the}} Lisbon Treaty as a basic principle for judicial cooperation in criminal matters, a consistent interpretation and application becomes all the more important. Nevertheless, no legally binding definition of {{mutual recognition}} is provided and a quick scan of the relevant instruments cannot but lead {{to the conclusion that}} mutual recognition appears in as many shapes and sizes as there are instruments referring to it. There seems to be no common understanding of what mutual recognition is, can and cannot be and how consistency is to be guaranteed. Therefore this article critically reviews mutual recognition as a principle and assesses the inconsistencies in the application thereof. The analysis is based on two hypotheses that could clarify the divergent evolution of the principle. The first hypothesis to explain the divergent evolutions is linked to the action radius and the proposition that mutual recognition is the cornerstone of judicial cooperation only. The second hypothesis suggests that the reason for these divergent evolutions is the lack of a common understanding of what mutual recognition entails, what it means or should mean in practice. Based on a thorough analysis of the relevant policy documents, treaties and judicial cooperation instruments (including their preparatory documentation and transcripts from debates in various fora) it is recommended to no longer distinguish between police, <b>customs</b> and judicial <b>cooperation</b> and move ahead with the introduction of mutual recognition as a basic principle for international cooperation in criminal matters in its entirety. Furthermore, the suggestion is made to introduce a lex mitior principle as a new automatic correcting mechanism to temper the effect of mutual recognition {{from the perspective of the}} persons involved...|$|R

The objectives of the center are animal welfare (AW) education, research, raising public awareness of AW, and increasing cooperation between the stakeholders. One Health (OH) was not the major focus of the AWC work initially, but, rather, a focus that evolved recently. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the AWC from the OH perspective as an example case for positioning the AW within the overall OH concept. Three types of evaluation were performed: (1) assessment of OH-ness, by quantitative measurement of the operational and infrastructural aspects of the AWC; (2) impact evaluation, by conducting quantitative surveys on stakeholders and students; and (3) transdisciplinary evaluation, using semi-quantitative evaluation of the links of cooperation between the AWC and the stakeholders in society by the <b>custom</b> designed CACA (<b>Cooperation,</b> Activities, Communication, and Agreement) scoring system. Results for the OH-ness of the AWC showed relatively high scores for OH thinking, planning and working and middle scores for OH learning and sharing dimensions, i. e., dominance of the operational over infrastructural aspects of the AWC. The impact evaluation of the AWC shows that familiarity with the OH concept among stakeholders was low (44 % of the respondents). However, there was a commonality among stakeholder’s interest about AW and OH. According to the stakeholders’ and students’ opinions, the influence of AW on Animal, Environmental, and Human Health is relatively high (in the upper third of the 1 – 10 scale). The transdisciplinary evaluation of the AWC indicated the presence of transdisciplinarity work by the AWC, with a higher focus on the Universities and Research Institutions and some governmental institutions, and less linked with the Non-Governmental Organizations and Professional Associations (Chambers), e. g., the Veterinary Chamber in Macedonia. The evaluations conducted indicated that the AWC’s work is closely dedicated to improving animal, environmental, and human health and has a considerable OH role among the stakeholders in the society.
