40|$|<b>Written</b> <b>submissions</b> or {{comments}} as {{a response}} on an EIS (Environmental Impact Statement) rank {{as one of the}} most common forms of public participation. Within public participation research there appears to be an international dearth of knowledge concerning such <b>written</b> <b>submissions.</b> The possible impact of such responses on an EIS is - with few exceptions - seldom put in focus. The aim in the present brief communication is to study one aspect of public participation within transport infrastructure planning, namely the role of <b>written</b> <b>submissions</b> sent to the applicant by individuals, Non-governmental organisations, companies and authorities. By comparing 34 <b>written</b> <b>submissions</b> with road planning documents (including EIS) the impact of the public views has been analysed in a south Swedish case study. At a time when the new Environmental Code only had been in force for less than one year, it does not appear as if the Road Administration's regional office accepted most of the <b>written</b> <b>submissions</b> just to show that the new regulation concerning participation had a direct impact on the planning. Sweden's long tradition of public access to official documents may explain why <b>written</b> <b>submissions</b> as one aspect of public participation worked well in the E 18 highway planning process, because civil servants have long been taught to promptly furnish information and guidance, as well as to giving advice and other assistance to individuals in matters concerning an authority's activity. This study shows, then, that - if properly managed by the developer's street-level staff - the use of <b>written</b> <b>submissions</b> may improve the EIS from a stakeholder perspective and also make the stakeholders feel they are being taken seriously.

40|$|In Australia, the {{community}} is often invited to make <b>written</b> <b>submissions</b> on natural resource management issues, especially regional water plans. This {{is seen as a}} method of increasing democracy by allowing citizens to provide input to the plan. Most Australian water plans have radically decreased water allocated to agriculture (McKay, 2011). In that context, this paper focuses on the process of the development of an innovative forestry water policy to incorporate plantation forestry as a Water Affecting Activity into the Lower Limestone Coast Water Allocation Plan. This is the ­ first plan in Australia explicitly imposing a regulation on forestry to account for interception losses and the use of shallow aquifer water by forest roots. There had been four public consultations in the forestry water policy development process, and <b>written</b> <b>submissions</b> were one way of stakeholder engagement in all of these public consultations. This paper is based on the analysis of the 31 con­fidential <b>written</b> <b>submissions,</b> received during the third public consultation on the Lower Limestone Coast Water Allocation Plan Policy Issues – Discussion Paper. ...|$|R
