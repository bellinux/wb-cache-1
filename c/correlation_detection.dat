40|$|Four {{methods of}} range {{measurement}} for airborne ultrasonic systems - namely simple thresholding, curve-fitting, sliding-window, and <b>correlation</b> <b>detection</b> - are compared {{on the basis}} of bias error, standard deviation, total error, robustness to noise, and the difficulty/complexity of implementation. Whereas <b>correlation</b> <b>detection</b> is theoretically optimal, the other three methods can offer acceptable performance at much lower cost. Performances of all methods have been investigated as a function of target range, azimuth, and signal-to-noise ratio. Curve fitting, sliding window, and thresholding follow <b>correlation</b> <b>detection</b> in the order of decreasing complexity. Apart from <b>correlation</b> <b>detection,</b> minimum bias and total error is most consistently obtained with the curve-fitting method. On the other hand, the sliding-window method is always better than the thresholding and curve-fitting methods in terms of minimizing the standard deviation. The experimental results are in close agreement with the corresponding simulation results. Overall, the three simple and fast processing methods provide a variety of attractive compromises between measurement accuracy and system complexity. Although this paper concentrates on ultrasonic range measurement in air, the techniques described may also find application in underwater acoustics...|$|E

In this sense, {{we can say that}} an entanglement or <b>correlation</b> <b>detection</b> problem captures the expressive power of each quantum interactive proof complexity class. The only promise problem of this flavor that is not known to be complete for a quantum interactive proof complexity class is a variation of the original quantum separability problem in which the goal is to decide if a quantum state output by a quantum circuit is separable or entangled. We also show that the difficulty of entanglement detection depends on whether the distance measure used is the trace distance or the one-way LOCC distance. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the distance properties of uncoded and trellis coded M-ary continuous phase frequency shift keyed (CPFSK) signals, when the receiver {{consists of a}} phase detector followed by a trellis decoder. Closed-form expressions for the minimum Euclidean of uncoded M-ary CPFSK signals are presented. These expressions yield exact values of minimum Euclidean distance for all rational valued modulation indices. An M-state trellis is shown to achieve almost all performance gain that is guaranteed {{by the memory of}} the modulation process of CPFSK signals when M > 2. [...] The minimum distance results for uncoded CPFSK signals show that phase detection and trellis decoding yields larger minimum distances than correlation demodulation and trellis decoding for small modulation indices (h ≤ 1 /M). The minimum distance results for trellis coded CPFSK signals also indicate that phase detection yields larger minimum distances than <b>correlation</b> <b>detection</b> for small h. [...] A computer search for the optimal codes of quaternary and octal CPFSK signals with phase detection and trellis decoding is carried out. For all constraint lengths and h ≤ 1 /M these codes are identical to the optimal codes found in the literature for <b>correlation</b> <b>detection.</b> It is also observed that trellis decoding of uncoded and coded CPFSK signals is transparent to the carrier phase ambiguities of the regenerated reference tones of the coherent demodulator. Considering the distance properties and the relative ease of implementation, it is concluded that phase detection and trellis decoding of M-ary CPFSK signals is superior to <b>correlation</b> <b>detection</b> of the same for h ≤ 1 /M...|$|E

40|$|Abnormal event {{detection}} {{is one of}} {{the vital}} tasks in wireless sensor networks. However, the faults of nodes and the poor deployment environment have brought great challenges to abnormal event detection. In a typical event detection technique, spatiotemporal correlations are collected to detect an event, which is susceptible to noises and errors. To improve the quality of detection results, we propose a novel approach for abnormal event detection in wireless sensor networks. This approach considers not only spatiotemporal correlations but also the correlations among observed attributes. A dependency model of observed attributes is constructed based on Bayesian network. In this model, the dependency structure of observed attributes is obtained by structure learning, and the conditional probability table of each node is calculated by parameter learning. We propose a new concept named attribute correlation confidence to evaluate the fitting degree between the sensor reading and the abnormal event pattern. On the basis of time <b>correlation</b> <b>detection</b> and space <b>correlation</b> <b>detection,</b> the abnormal events are identified. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the impact of interference factors and the rate of the false alarm effectively; it can also improve the accuracy of event detection...|$|E

While the underlying processes at the synapses are not fully understood, there is strong evidence that a process of random, independent formation and pruning of excitatory synapses can be ruled out. Instead, {{there must be some}} cooperation between the synaptic contacts connecting a single pre- and postsynaptic neuron pair. So far, the mechanism of cooperation is not known. Here we demonstrate that local <b>correlation</b> <b>detection</b> at the postsynaptic dendritic spine suffices to explain the synaptic cooperation effect, without assuming any hypothetical direct interaction pathway between the synaptic contacts. Candidate biomolecular mechanisms for dendritic <b>correlation</b> <b>detection</b> have been identified previously, as well as for structural plasticity based thereon. By analyzing and fitting of a simple model, we show that spike-timing correlation dependent structural plasticity, without additional mechanisms of cross-synapse interaction, can reproduce the experimentally observed distributions of numbers of synaptic contacts between pairs of neurons in the neocortex. Furthermore, the model yields a first explanation for the existence of both transient and persistent dendritic spines and allows to make predictions for future experiments...|$|E
