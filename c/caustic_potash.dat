Percentage elongation and reduction in cross-sectional area were used to investigate the SCC of the steel. The results obtained showed that MCS is susceptible to SCC in both <b>caustic</b> soda and <b>potash</b> media. Carbon cracking caused intergranular SCC in both media due to retained internal stresses in the steel while hydrogen cracking also occurred in caustic soda medium, hence MCS is more susceptible to SCC in caustic soda medium than potash solution...|$|R

2500|$|A recent area of {{work has}} been the {{destruction}} of toxic organic compounds by irradiation; after irradiation, [...] "dioxins" [...] (polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins) are dechloroinated {{in the same way}} as PCBs can be converted to biphenyl an inorganic chloride. This is because the solvated electrons react with the organic compound to form a radical anion, which decomposes by the loss of a chloride anion. If a deoxygenated mixture of PCBs in isopropanol or mineral oil is irradiated with gamma rays, then the PCBs will be dechlorinated to form inorganic chloride and biphenyl. The reaction works best in isopropanol if potassium hydroxide (<b>caustic</b> <b>potash)</b> is added. The base deprotonates the hydroxydimethylmethyl radical to be converted into acetone and a solvated electron, as the result the G value (yield for a given energy due to radiation deposited in the system) of chloride can be increased because the radiation now starts a chain reaction, each solvated electron formed by the action of the gamma rays can now convert more than one PCB molecule. If oxygen, acetone, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride or nitrobenzene is present in the mixture, then the reaction rate is reduced. This {{work has been}} done recently in the USA, often with used nuclear fuel as the radiation source.|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{methods of}} {{observation}} {{applied to the}} sculpture of tectibranch shells and to the radulae of gastropods in general, have yielded {{a great deal of}} information regarding the structure of these organs, which are so important in taxonomy. In the genus Philine, for instance, the numerous European species can be reliably distinguished only by means of radular formula and shell-sculpture. In other genera the structure of these organs is also of crucial importance for identification. In most opisthobranch families the structure of the radular teeth is a uniquely reliable feature. Published descriptions of shell-sculpture in opisthobranchs have, however, not hitherto passed the handlens level of accuracy. The radula is customarily prepared for microscopic examination (following dissection, and cleaning in hot <b>caustic</b> soda or <b>potash)</b> by staining and mounting in balsam, or, more recently, in polyvinyl lactophenol (Thompson, 1958). These methods for the radula have the great disadvantage that it is necessary to squash the preparation considerably in order to examine the teeth. The results of squashing are somewhat unpredictable and, moreover, may distort or alter the natural relationships of the teeth, rendering difficult a functional interpretation of radular morphology...|$|R
2500|$|The first commercially {{practical}} closed-circuit scuba {{was designed}} and built by the diving engineer Henry Fleuss in 1878, while working for Siebe Gorman in London.

In 1826 he also pointed out, that bodies not containing water, as fused litharge and chlorate of potassa, were sufficient to form, with platina and zinc, powerful electromotive circles[B]; but he is here speaking of the production of electricity in the pile, and not of its effects when evolved; nor do his words at all imply that any correction of his former distinct statements relative to decomposition was required.|$|E
60|$|Alimentary Canal.--The {{oesophagus}} is very narrow, and {{of remarkable}} length; from the orifice under the mandibles, it first runs back (in this respect not well represented in Pl. V, fig. 1,) under the bullate labrum, and then {{straight down the}} peduncle, where it terminates in the usual bell-shaped expansion, entering {{one side of the}} small globular stomach; the latter, at its lower end, is slightly constricted, and then is rather abruptly upturned. The rectum is of unparalleled length, and extremely narrow; it can be best detected after the dissolution by <b>caustic</b> <b>potash</b> of the softer parts, when its inner coat of chitine can be seen to be continuous, in the ordinary manner, with the outer integuments of the thorax.

Being then put into a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, combination immediately began, and proceeded rapidly; the tube became warm, the platina became red-hot, and the residue of the gases was inflamed. This effect could be repeated at pleasure, and thus the maximum phenomenon could be produced without the aid of the voltaic battery.|$|E
60|$|The cement, {{removed from}} the outside of a Cirripede, {{consists}} of {{a thin layer of}} very tough, bright-brown, transparent, laminated substance, exhibiting no structure under the highest powers, or at most a very fine dotted appearance, like a mezzotinto drawing. It is of the nature of chitine; but boiling <b>caustic</b> <b>potash</b> has rather more effect on it than on true chitine; and I think boiling nitric acid rather less effect. In one single instance, namely, in Coronula, the cement comes out of the four orifices of the two bifurcating ducts, in the shape of distinct cells, which, between the whale's skin and the basal membrane, arrange themselves so as to make a circular, continuous slip of cement; then the cells blend together, and are converted into transparent, structureless cement. Cementing tissue or membrane would, perhaps, have been a more correct title than cement; but, in ordinary cases, its appearance is so little like that of an organised tissue, that I have for this reason, and for brevity-sake, preferred the simple term of Cement.|$|E

60|$|General Appearance.--Shape, flask-like, {{compressed}} (Pl. V, fig. 9, magnified 36 times), {{with a short}} neck: {{the outline}} is usually symmetrical, but sometimes is a little distorted on the under side. The creature is imbedded {{more than half its}} length or depth in the transparent, spine-bearing chitine border of the scutum of the hermaphrodite. Its length, or longer axis, varies from 10 to 11/400ths; its breadth, or transverse axis, is 6 to 7/400ths; and its thickness, for it is much flattened, is only 4/400ths of an inch. On the summit, there is a fimbriated orifice (a), the size of which can rarely be made out quite distinctly, owing to the extreme thinness of the membranous edges. A little way beneath the orifice, there are four little blunt, bristly points (b), generally rather more than the 1/1000th of an inch in length; they are rather variable in size, and seem to be of no functional importance; directly beneath them, there are four little calcareous beads (as may be known by their dissolving with effervescence in any acid, and breaking easily under the needle); these are the 3/2000ths of an inch in their larger external diameter; they are rather deeply imbedded in the outer integument, and taper a little downwards ending in a concave terminal point, into which a minute tubulus enters, like those passing into and through the valves of ordinary Cirripedia: along the axis of imbedment, they are often 4/2000ths of an inch in length. These calcareous beads or rudimental valves are seated in pairs, at the two ends of the flattened animal, so that when the animal is laid on one side, the upper bead in each pair exactly covers and hides the lower one. The outer integument is composed of chitine, as may be inferred from boiling <b>caustic</b> <b>potash</b> having no effect on it; the upper part is thicker than the imbedded portion and is wrinkled transversely; it is covered with minute spines 4/10,000ths of an inch in length, either single or in groups of two and three, (Pl. V, fig. 14.) This outer tunic is lined by corium, sometimes slightly mottled with dull purple; and this by delicate, longitudinal, striæ-less muscles, running from the base up to the under edge of the orifice; these longitudinal muscles are crossed, at least, in the upper part, by still finer transverse muscles.|$|E
60|$|Alimentary Canal.--The {{oesophagus}} is {{of considerable}} length: it is formed of strong, transparent, much folded membrane, continuous with the outer integuments, and moulted with them: it {{is surrounded by}} corium, and as already stated, by numerous muscles: at its lower end it expands into a bell, with the edges reflexed, and sometimes sinuous: this bell lies within the stomach, and keeps the upper broad end expanded. According to the less or greater distance of the mouth from the adductor muscle, the oesophagus runs in {{a more or less}} parallel course to the abdominal surface between the first and succeeding pairs of cirri, and enters the stomach more or less obliquely. In Ibla alone, it passes exteriorly to, and over the adductor scutorum muscle. The stomach lies in a much curved, almost doubled course; it is often a little constricted where most bent; it is broadest at the upper end, and here, in Lepas and Conchoderma, there are some deep branching cæca; in the latter of these two genera, the whole surface is, in addition, pitted in transverse lines. The stomach is coated by small, opaque, pulpy, slightly arborescent glands, believed to be hepatic; these are arranged in longitudinal lines, in all the genera, except in Alepas, in which they are transverse and reticulated: the whole stomach is thus coated. There is, also, a coating of excessively delicate, longitudinal and transverse muscles without striæ. The rectum varies in length, extending inwards from the anus to between the bases of the second and fifth pair of cirri: it is narrow, and formed of much folded transparent membrane, resembling the oesophagus, continuous with the outer integuments, with which it is periodically moulted. The anus is a small longitudinal slit, in the triangular piece of membrane representing the abdomen, let in between the last thoracic tergal arches, as already mentioned under the head of the Metamorphoses; it lies almost between the caudal appendages, and opens on the dorsal surface. Within the stomach, there can generally be plainly seen, in accordance with the period of digestion when the specimen was taken, a thin, yet strong, perfectly transparent epithelial membrane, not exhibiting under the highest power of the microscope any structure: it enters the branching cæca, and extends {{from the edge of the}} bell of the oesophagus to the commencement of the closed rectum, and consequently terminates in a point: it consists of chitine, like the outer integuments of the animal, and by placing the whole body in <b>caustic</b> <b>potash,</b> I have dissolved the outer coats of the stomach, and seen the bag open at its upper end, perfectly preserved, floating in the middle of the body, and full of the debris of the food. In most of the specimens which I have examined, preserved in spirits of wine, this epithelial lining was some little way distant and separate from the coats of the stomach; and hence was thought by M. Martin St. Ange to be a distinct organ, like the closed tube in certain Annelids. Occasionally, I have seen one imperfect epithelial bag or tube within another and later-formed one. Digestion seems to go on at the same rate throughout the whole length of the stomach; if there be any difference, the least digested portions lie in the lower and narrower part. The prey, consisting generally of crustacea, infusoria, minute spiral univalves, and often of the larvæ of Cirripedes, is not triturated: when the nutritious juices have been absorbed, the rejectamenta are cast out through the anus, all kept together in the epithelial bag, which is excluded like a model of the whole stomach, with the exception of that part coated by the bell of the oesophagus. I have sometimes thought that the bag was formed so strong, for the sake of thus carrying out the excrement entire, so as not to befoul the sack. I believe Lepas can throw up food by its oesophagus; at least, I found in one case, many half-digested small Crustaceans in the sack, and others of the same kind in the stomach.|$|E
60|$|Peduncle,--short, narrow, being {{abruptly}} inflected {{all round}} under the basal {{edges of the}} capitulum; lower part of very variable shape, being often suddenly contracted into a mere thread (fig. 6 b), which sometimes widens again at the extreme end. The external membrane is very thin, and is penetrated by the usual fine tubuli leading to the corium; its surface is wrinkled and destitute of spines, or with extremely few. The peduncle is often completely surrounded by a yellowish ball, (of which I have seen specimens from the coast of England, and from off Borneo,) sometimes half {{as wide as the}} capitulum, composed of very tender, vesicular, structureless membrane, and of a pulpy substance: perhaps the yellow colour may be owing to long immersion in spirits. Some authors have supposed that the ball was the ovisac of the animal; and for the first few minutes, deceived by the numerous included spores of, as I believe, Bacillariæ, I thought that this was the case; others have supposed that it consisted of some encrusting algæ or other foreign organism; but it is, in reality, a most singular development of the cement-tissue, which ordinarily serves to attach Cirripedes by their bases to some extraneous object, but here surrounding that object and the peduncle, gives buoyancy, by its vesicular structure, to the whole. The membrane of the ball falls to pieces in <b>caustic</b> <b>potash,</b> differently from the chitine membrane of the enclosed peduncle, and this shows that there is some difference in composition from ordinary cement. The ball, when cut in two, exhibits an obscure concentric structure. The whole is excreted by the two cement-ducts, through two rows of orifices, one {{on each side of the}} surrounded portion of the peduncle; and I actually traced, in one case, the yellow pulpy substance coming out of the cement-ducts. The upper apertures are in gradation larger than those below them, and they stand a little further apart from each other; these are figured as seen from the outside, much magnified, at Pl. I, fig. 6 d. I did not succeed in finding the cement-glands, but I followed the ducts, of rather large size, running for a considerable distance as usual along and within the longitudinal muscles of the peduncle. Nearly opposite the uppermost aperture, on each side, the duct passes out through the corium, and becomes laterally attached to the outer membrane of the peduncle, at which point an aperture is formed (as in other cases, by some unknown process), thus giving exit to the contents of the duct. Beneath this upper aperture the duct runs down the peduncle, between the corium and the outer membrane, till it comes to the next aperture, to which it is also attached, and so on to all the lower ones; but I believe no cement tissue continues to pass out through these lower apertures. Beneath the lowest aperture the two ducts run into the two prehensile antennæ of the larva, which, as usual, terminate the peduncle. The antennæ are attached to some small foreign body in the centre of the vesicular ball, by the usual tough, light brown, transparent cement. The two upper apertures are nearly on a level with the outside surface of the ball; and it was evident that as the animal grows, new apertures are formed higher and higher up on the sides of the peduncle, and that out of these, fresh vesicular membrane proceeds, and grows over the old ball in a continuous layer. It appears that the growth of the vesicular ball is not regular,--that it is not always formed,--and that when formed the whole, or the lower part, sometimes disintegrates and is washed away. As that portion of the peduncle which is enclosed ceases to grow, and has its muscles absorbed, retaining only the underlying corium, whereas the upper unenclosed portion, and likewise, (as it appears) lower portions once enclosed but since denuded, continue to increase in diameter, the peduncle, when the vesicular ball is removed, often has the most irregular outline, contracting suddenly into a mere thread, and then occasionally expanding again at the basal point.|$|E
