To examine the use of LDMS in a rapid new malaria screening assay, we followed the time course of P. yoelii infections in mice in parallel with light microscopy and a colorimetric hemozoin assay. Hemozoin was detected by LDMS in 0. 3 L of blood within two days of infection independently of the inoculating dose of 106, 104, or 102 parasite-infected eryth-rocytes. Microscopy and colorimetric hemozoin determinations lagged the LDMS detection of infections by 2 − 4 and 3 − 5 days, respectively, except at the highest inoculation dose.

40|$|Version of RecordThe {{ability to}} <b>control</b> <b>escalating</b> tuition costs while still {{delivering}} a high-quality educational {{experience is the}} key to the continued success of post-secondary education in the US. Unlike many industries, where growth in customers and overall expansion often translates to lower costs, this has not been true for labor intensive business models like American higher education. The delivery model has changed little over the last 200 years. The challenge for today's university leader is to create a learning environment that insures the intellectual potential of students is maximized while controlling costs and protecting academic integrity. At Southern New Hampshire University the traditional four year business administration curriculum model was redesigned into three uncompressed years, cutting tuition costs by 25 % without sacrificing learning outcomes. The results are compelling. Students save time and tuition costs and the university experiences a savings in instructional delivery costs. The academic achievement of these students, as measured by scores on the Educational Testing Service Major Field tests, is at, or above, the national median. The model described in this paper represents just one illustration of curriculum changes required to address two major challenges now facing American higher education - that of cost control and reduction, and a curriculum more responsive to the need of business and industry. Failure to act decisively on these two fronts puts at risk the pursuit of an undergraduate degree as a rite of passage for many and opens the door for more significant competition from corporate universities and for-profit educational institutions.

As the world cyber-shrinks, {{the ways in which}} governments and courts attempt to control the information on the web has become diverse and contradictory. Issues of national interest and international jurisdiction have stretched across all aspects of the web. We must find a more cooperative, coherent and consistent international policy, one which fosters the free flow of information, while protecting personality rights. The controversy {{is not limited to the}} present, but affects the way the Internet records and preserves history. As newspapers bring massive archives online, they are faced with defamation laws which may hinder the free flow of information or inadequately protect personality rights. What is protected speech in one country may be defamation judged from another country in a future time. This paper explores the traditional liability regimes concerning paper archives and how these laws are applied to online archives available on the web. The paper explores how national courts are attempting to mold traditional theories of liability to fit the new Internet-based reality of publishing and archive maintenance. The paper explores the recent case in Germany, which extends national jurisdiction into the New York Times archives in New York City, as well as cases specifically dealing with online defamation standards. We also review the enforcement of defamation judgments from foreign jurisdictions in the US, where many of the media outlets involved in the litigation are headquartered. The paper then outlines recent developments to “combat” libel tourism in the US, in particular, statutes which would extend jurisdiction to foreign nationals who have not availed themselves of American jurisdiction. These laws seek to extend the First Amendment far beyond American borders.

The health of the Japanese population as judged by neonatal, postnatal, and total infant mortality, percent of infants born with birth weights below 2500 g, and life expectancy at birth and ages 20 and 65 is superior to the health of Americans. Primary care, however, as an academic discipline and primary care training programs are absent in Japan. Physician training, incongruent with need, combined with government controlled low professional medical fees contribute to an extraordinarily high annual ambulatory patient contact rate (14 compared with 2. 8 for Americans) and excessive use of diagnostic testing. Although primary care training is better developed in the U. S. A., interest in receiving such training among medical school graduates is declining. Several factors that contribute to quality of care are examined. Comparisons between countries, however, must be viewed with caution because of the multitude of demographic, genetic, historical, economic and cultural variables that influence how health care is delivered and received. Both countries face major challenges. The projected rapid increase in the relative ratio of the elderly to total population in Japan will severely strain its ability to contain health care costs. Interest in primary care training in Japan dates back to 1978 but its implementation has been largely unsuccessful. The challenges in the U. S. A. are far more formidable.

For short leases, under three years, there is no requirement for writing, and under seven years, there is no requirement for registration. Longer leases, {{even if they do}} not fulfil formality and registration requirements will also arise in equity under the doctrine of anticipation, formulated in Walsh v Lonsdale. This means that the interest takes effect under a constructive trust, in turn leading to protection for actual occupants. Formally known under the Law of Property Act 1925 section 205(1)(xxvii) as a [...] "term of years absolute", a lease divides property by time, and with a lease comes a measure of statutory protections for tenants.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to <b>control</b> <b>escalating</b> health expenditures, {{especially}} in hospitals, many countries are planning or experimenting with prospective budgeting systems. Belgium is no exception and has recently introduced, with some success, limited fixed charges per hospital admission and/or per hospitalisation day for laboratory tests and radiographic investigations. More recently, the focus has shifted to hospital drug expenditures, which have shown high growth rates {{over the past few}} years. Until now, such expenditures have been reimbursed on a fee-for-service system, often with limited out-of-pocket charges for hospitalised patients. In order to curb the growth of drug expenditures, it is appropriate to investigate whether the financing of hospital drugs through a prospective budgeting system could be a feasible solution. Therefore, we constructed a database of over 270 000 admissions from a sample of 23 Belgian general and teaching (university) hospitals for the year 1991. Data were obtained from the official Minimum Basic Data Set or Résumé Clinique Minimum, which contains summarised clinical and administrative information, plus detailed expenditures (including medications) for each hospital stay. This information allowed us to categorize each stay into an appropriate diagnosis-related group (DRG). Our first descriptive analysis identified a number of major variables that influenced patients' drug expenditures: all-patient DRG (APDRG), age, disease severity, length of stay in an intensive care unit, emergency admission, death during hospitalisation, and hospital type (teaching or general). A covariance analysis was then performed on all hospital stays combined, and separately on surgical and medical stays. The results indicated that these variables taken together account for between 56. 5 and 76. 3 % of drug expenditures in medical and surgical stays, respectively, with the major variance explained by differences in APDRG category. However, when the data were disaggregated according to major diagnosis category, a large degree of heterogeneity in the explained variance was observed. In patients with drug use- and alcohol-related disorders, 5. 2 % of drug billings/expenditures were attributable to the APDRG, and the corresponding figure in patients undergoing circulatory system surgery was 84 %. This means that, if DRGs are used to define a global prospective drug budget for a hospital, using the hospital's historical case mix as a weighting factor, we should pay particular attention to the hospital profile because the predictive power of such a system could be relatively low in some hospitals. Consequently, we need to construct larger confidence intervals for hospitals in which historical drug expenditures have low predictive power, or search for additional explanatory variables for expenditures in these hospitals...|$|R
