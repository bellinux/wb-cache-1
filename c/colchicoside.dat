40|$|International audienceMetastatic bone {{disease is}} a serious {{clinical}} complication {{for the treatment of}} patients with advanced cancer, but few therapeutic options are currently available. Bisphosphonates are an established standard care for these patients, but new treatments are now emerging, including the use of monoclonal antibodies targeting the RANK ligand. In this issue of the BJP, Reuter et al. provide evidence that thiocolchicoside, a semi-synthetic derivative of the naturally occurring <b>colchicoside,</b> extracted from the seeds of Gloriosa superba (Liliaceae), prevented osteoclactogenesis by suppressing RANK ligand-mediated NF-κB activation. Thiolcolchicoside may thus represent an attractive therapeutic option for the management of bone metastatic disease...|$|E
40|$|Thiocolchicoside, is a {{synthetic}} sulphur derivative of <b>colchicoside,</b> a naturally occurring glucosidecontained in the Colchicum autumnale plant Thiocolchicoside has a selective affinity for g-amino-butyric acid (GABA) receptors and acts on themuscular contracture by activating the GABA-nergicinhibitory pathways thereby {{acting as a}} potent mus-cle relaxant Thiocolchicoside (Muscoril, Myoril, Neoflax) is a muscle relaxant with anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. It acts as a competitive GABAA receptor antagonist and also inhibits glycine receptors with similar potency and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to a much lesser extent. It has powerful convulsant activity {{and should not be}} used in seizureprone individuals. Mode of action includes modulation of chemokine and prostanoid production and inhibition of neutrophil and endothelial cell adhesion molecules by which it interferes with the initiation and amplification of the joint inflammation.

30|$|Gloriosa superba L., {{belongs to}} Colchicaceae family. It is a perennial, greenish, {{climbing}} herb and nativity of South Africa. Every {{part of this}} plant is being used in Siddha, Ayurveda and Unani system of medicine. It is a tuberous plant with L–V shaped cylindrical tubers. The tuber powder was effectively used against paralysis, rheumatism, snake bite, insect bites, against lice, intermittent fevers, wounds, anti-fertility, gonorrhea, leprosy, piles, debility, dyspepsia, flatulence, hemorrhoids, helminthiasis and inflammations [13]. It contains two major alkaloids namely colchicines (C 22 H 25 NO 6) and <b>colchicosides</b> (C 27 H 33 O 11 N). The seeds consist of colchicines, which are 2 – 5 times {{higher than in the}} tubers [14]. Leaves contain cholidonic, superbine, colchicine, gloriosol, phytosterils and stigmasterin [15].|$|R
30|$|Gloriosa superba L., (family Colchicaceae). It is a {{climbing}} herb {{and native}} of South Africa. Its flower {{is a national}} flower of Tamil Eelam, Zimbabwe, and state flower of Tamil Nadu. It is an endangered medicinal plant in southern India. Since 2000 B.C., it is {{being used as a}} traditional medicine by the tribes. The entire plant has been used in Siddha, Ayurveda and Unani medicine. G. superba is a tuberous plant with plow- (or) finger-shaped cylindrical tubers that are pure white when it is young [34]. It contains two major alkaloids namely Colchicines and <b>Colchicosides.</b> The seeds consist of colchicines, which are 2 – 5 times higher than in the tubers. Due to the medicinal value, this plant is collected from the wild and it belongs to rare plant species in India. It has been included in the Red data book. The major problems in commercial cultivation of this plant are because of low propagation rate of seeds and the viability of seeds being only 50  % [35, 36]. It takes four or five vegetative cycles to finish the reproductive phase [37]. These conventional propagation methods are less efficient. Hence, {{there is a need to}} improve the mass propagation of medicinal plant through nanotechnology applications. Nowadays, metal and metal oxide nanoparticles are used in crop production [5, 38, 39]. Arora et al. [40] have reported that 10  ppm of Au NP-treated Braceca juncea seedlings have enhanced the net productivity of seed yield.|$|R
40|$|The study {{addressed}} {{the effect of}} colchicine and its derivatives on the protein levels of cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 1 A 2, 2 A 6, 3 A 4, 2 C 9 / 19, and 2 E 1 isoforms. Primary human hepatocyte culture was the model of choice. Levels of individual CYP isoforms were detected using immunoblotting. Colchicine caused an increase of CYP 2 E 1 protein content, colchiceine and N-deacetylcolchiceine induced isoforms CYP 2 C 9, 2 E 1 and 3 A 4 whereas <b>colchicoside</b> induced CYP 2 C 9 and 2 E 1. The levels of CYP 1 A 2 and 2 A 6 were unaffected by any of tested compounds. Demecolcine and 3 -demethylcolchicine {{had no effect on}} any studied P 450 isoform. Since colchicine is an exclusive substrate of CYP 3 A 4 whereas it induces CYP 2 E 1, there is a suspicion rather at protein stabilization than at gene induction concerning induction origin...|$|E

Thiocolchicoside is a semisynthetic derivate of naturally occurring <b>colchicoside,</b> which is largely used in humans as a centrally acting muscle relaxant. Epileptic seizures after thiocolchicoside intake {{have been reported}} in individuals with a history of epilepsy, acute brain injury or possible blood&ndash;brain barrier disruption. Case report: We report the case of a 66 -year-old male patient presenting a sudden epileptic seizure temporally related to the intake of thiocolchicoside for muscle contracture and pain. The probably causes of the seizures were thiocolchicoside intake and cerebral microhemorrhages attributed to cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Discussion: Drugs only rarely cause focal seizures. Our case indicates that thiocolchicoside can precipitate seizures in predisposed patients, and that its use should be avoided in patients with brain diseases (and therefore lower seizure thresholds) or blood&ndash;brain barrier disruption. This information should be provided in the drug package insert. Keywords: adverse drug reaction, thiocolchicoside, coltrax, epileptic seizure, muscle relaxant, cerebral amyloid angiopath...|$|E
40|$|Gloriosa superba L. is a {{medicinal}} climber, its {{seeds and}} tubers contain valuable alkaloids viz., colchicine and <b>colchicoside</b> {{as the major}} constituents, which are used to treat gout and rheumatism. The growing demand for the seeds of G. superba in the international market and the wider popularity it has gained among the farmers necessitates attempts to induce new variability with high yield, high colchicine content, dwarf stature and leaf blight resistant of the plant as well. In the present study, eighteen glory lily genotypes were used to estimate character association and generate a path analysis for 13 morpho-economic traits. Plant height, number of leaves per plant, number of branches per plant, days to 50 % flowering, number of flowers per plant, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per plant, fresh seed weight per plant, fresh seed yield per plant and fresh seed recovery {{were found to have}} positive association with dry seed yield per plant. Fresh seed yield per plant had highest positive effect on seed yield followed by number of pods per plant and fresh seed weight per pod. These associated yield components suggested that it may be good selection criteria to improve seed yield of glory lily crop...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Gloriosa superba Linn. {{is one of}} the {{important}} medicinal plant now in endangered list. This plant is widely used for several ethano-medicinal purposes by tribal peoples and traditional practitioners. Seeds and tubers contain valuale alkaloids viz., colchine and <b>colchicoside</b> as the major constituents, which are used an antidote for snake bites, gout and rheumatism. Present study was to evaluate the phytochemicals present in leaves, flowers, seeds and tuber samples were collected from four different places of Dharmapuri District. Preliminary phytochemical analyses were carried out by standard procedures. Methanol extract of all samples were evaluated for protein, starch, total sugar and total phenol. The screening tests also were performed for the presence of the following secondary metabolites such as alkaloid, flavonoids, glycosides, phenols, saponins, steroids, tannin and terpenoids. The results were revealed the presence of various classes of compounds {{in different parts of the}} plant.
