5000|$|A 2015 {{study of}} mammoth molars {{confirmed}} that M. <b>columbi</b> evolved from Eurasian M. trogontherii, not M. meridionalis {{as had been}} suggested earlier, and noted that M. <b>columbi</b> and M. trogontherii were so similar in morphology that their classification as separate species may be questionable. The study also suggested that the animals in the range where M. <b>columbi</b> and M. primigenius overlapped formed a metapopulation of hybrids with varying morphology. In 2016, a genetic study of North American mammoth specimens confirmed that M. <b>columbi</b> and M. primigenius interbred extensively, were both descended from M. trogontherii, and concluded that morphological differences between fossils may therefore not be reliable for determining taxonomy. The authors also questioned whether M. <b>columbi</b> and M. primigenius should be considered [...] "good species", considering {{that they were able}} to interbreed after supposedly being separated for a million years, but cautioned that more specimens need to be sampled.|$|R

50|$|In his letter, <b>Columbus's</b> {{description}} of the land focuses on listing exploitable natural resources {{and what can be}} built there in the future (mines, towns, farms), rather than launching into descriptive dissertations. There are no extended allusions to an earthly Garden of Eden, marvelous vegetation or colorful songbirds, or the structure of Indian villages, as can be found in Vespucci's letters or in <b>Columbus's</b> own journal. It seems evident <b>Columbus's</b> letter was written for an audience of European officials and merchants, not to delight the imagination of common European readers.|$|R

Following the game some altercations broke out between the two supporter groups. Overwhelmed security called police who ended the melees and made arrests, at which time a TFC fan was tasered while being subdued. The first rematch back in <b>Columbus</b> Crew Stadium following the incident was boycotted by Toronto FC supporters in wake of restrictions imposed on them by Crew officials.|$|E

5000|$|Canoutas did not {{identify}} <b>Columbus’s</b> parents or place of birth, nor did he analyze <b>Columbus’s</b> claimed kinship bond with Dishypatos.

[...] For example, the Palaiologos family were the rulers of Montferrat for more than 200 years. This connection, he argued, might explain why <b>Columbus’s</b> contemporaries and others considered him to be Genoese or Ligurian.|$|R
