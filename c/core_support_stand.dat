Since its inception, the F. B. Heron Foundation has primarily made <b>core</b> <b>support</b> grants. We believe that <b>core</b> <b>support</b> promotes effectiveness, innovation, leverage, and transparency among our grantees, {{as well as more}} candor between grantee and grantor. In this essay, we add our voice to the ongoing dialogue about a better balance between <b>core</b> <b>support</b> and restricted grants...|$|R

5000|$|The New Korea Party was a rebranded {{version of}} the {{coalition}} of conservative and moderate forces that had come together in 1990 with the mergers of Kim Young-Sam’s centrist party (<b>core</b> <b>support</b> area: Pusan and South Kyongsang), Kim Jong-Pil’s moderate conservative party (<b>core</b> <b>support</b> area: Chungcheong), and Roh Tae-Woo’s conservative party (<b>core</b> <b>support</b> area: Taegu and North Kyongsang), the latter {{of which was the}} clearest successor to the military-oriented regimes of the 1960s to 1980s. The party’s rebranding as ‘New Korea’ came following the departure of Kim Jong-Pil’s party from this coalition in 1995. (The New Korea Party was renamed the Grand National Party in 1998 and essentially endured through the mid 2010s, with Kim Jong-Pil and his followers also returning by 2006, until the political crisis of 2016 under Park Geun-Hye caused severe divisions that broke apart the successor Saenuri party.) ...|$|R

40|$|At the November 2008 Weingart Foundation Board meeting, the Board {{made the}} {{decision}} to accelerate its focus on general operating support funding by adding the <b>core</b> <b>support</b> program in response to the economic downturn. The goal of this decision was to meet the need for nonprofits to secure unrestricted funding {{that would allow them to}} maintain and sustain core programs and services. While <b>core</b> <b>support</b> grants initially focused on critical "safety-net" providers, the program has since been expanded to all organizations that operate programs within the Foundation's overall grant focus of health, education and human services. Unrestricted <b>core</b> <b>support</b> funding provides nonprofit organizations with the working capital necessary to sustain day-to-day operations and to build a well-managed and fully operational infrastructure. This is the type of support nonprofits need most to fulfill their missions as effectively and efficiently as possible - allowing them to build capacity and sustainability over the long-term. At the Weingart Foundation, we advance our mission by providing grants and other support designed to improve the capacity and sustainability of nonprofit organizations working in the areas of health, human services, and education, and will continue to prioritize unrestricted <b>core</b> <b>support</b> funding as part of our grantmaking program and strategy...|$|R

Between 2003 and 2006, BSCF invested more than $ 12 million in nearly 200 community health clinics, parent corporations and clinic consortia/networks.

Among the findings: <b>core</b> <b>support</b> stabilizes clinics and therefore strengthens the entire safety net, helps clinics raise additional funds, and boosts staff morale.
