5000|$|Many {{financial}} services {{companies have been}} involved in packaging a collection of similar instruments, such as municipal bonds, into <b>closed</b> <b>funds</b> that were sold as both preferred and common shares. One of the largest issuer of auction rate securities was NUVEEN Investments, which since the failure of the auction market has begun to provide disclosure on their website.

According to multiple reports, these were widely sold as [...] "cash equivalents", such that the cash would be available for return within as little as 7 days. However, once the auctions were abandoned by the banks, thousands of investors were left with these illiquid funds since February 2008, without knowing when their cash will be returned.|$|E
40|$|Since many {{commercial}} datasets still {{include only}} those funds {{that are currently}} in operation, survivorship bias {{is an important issue}} in studies of mutual fund performance. This article is the first to systematically examine the existence, significance, and the drivers of survivorship bias by applying the various different methods and definitions used in previous research on a uniform fund dataset (CRSP). We show that there is significant survivorship bias when <b>closed</b> <b>funds</b> are ignored, and that the choice of methods and definitions is crucial for the magnitude of the survivorship bias estimates. Furthermore we examine in detail the performance and fund size of <b>closed</b> <b>funds</b> which drives survivorship bias. <b>Closed</b> <b>funds</b> clearly underperform surviving funds years before they are actually closed. Fund size is a key characteristic for closing decisions. The larger a fund, the lower the likelihood that funds are closed, even if the returns are temporarily relatively low...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to {{systematically}} test the significance of survivorship bias using a comprehensive database and to test the significance of the differences of survivorship biases resulting from different methodical approaches. We apply the various methods most commonly used in the literature on a uniform dataset. In addition, we analyze the performance of <b>closed</b> <b>funds</b> as the driver of survivorship bias and the performance of new funds as the driver of incubation bias. Our main findings are: i) Ignoring <b>closed</b> <b>funds</b> leads to a significantly positive survivorship bias. This is in line with previous research. ii) The choice of methods leads to statistically and economically significant differences in survivorship bias estimates. We are able to suggest a bias-minimizing combination of methods if survivorship bias-free data is not available. iii) The performance of <b>closed</b> <b>funds</b> drives survivorship bias since these funds underperform surviving funds years before they are closed. iv) We find evidence for incubation bias in our data but its impact is rather small and clearly depends on the methods applied...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the decision to}} close mutual funds to new investors due {{to the growth of}} the funds ’ assets. The evidence indicates that funds perform better three years prior to closing to new investors than they do afterwards.

However, there is {{no significant difference in the}} pe$ormance of closed finds and their matched control porcolios during the one- and three-year periods after closing. Although the primary reason given for closing the finds is the desire to maintain performance in the face of growing assets, the strategy does not appea...|$|E

40|$|The Vietnam {{stock market}} is a young and small stock market, but it has {{attracted}} much attention from the financial public. The Vietnam {{stock market is}} also one of the most volatile markets with 2 “bubbles” and 2 recessions within 1 year. <b>Closed</b> end <b>fund</b> is considered as a measure of the sentiment of individual investors (De Long, Shleifer, Summers, and Waldmann (1990)). <b>Closed</b> end <b>fund</b> is one of the shares that we can measure its fundamentals through the Net Asset Value (NAV). The <b>closed</b> end <b>fund</b> is traded at the discount of its NAV, and that discount is the sentiment of the investor with the market condition. However, according to the observations, during the most optimism of the stock market, there is a period that the <b>closed</b> end <b>fund</b> was traded at a premium, but in other optimistic period, even when the index boosted highly, the fund was still traded at a discount. This is not consistent with the findings of De Long and Shleifer (1990) about the relationship between <b>closed</b> end <b>fund</b> price changes and the stock market bubble in 1929. This paper investigates what drives the premia of the <b>closed</b> end <b>fund</b> in the Vietnamese stock market. In particular, the paper suggests some predictors that can influence the movement of the fund’s price. Emerging markets are attractive to foreign investors. Due to the small size of the markets, capital flows of the foreign investors influence very much on the price movement of the stocks, as well as the premia. The premia can be seen as a measure of the sentiment of the foreign investors toward the local market (Bleany and Smith, 2003). In the Vietnamese stock market, the trading volume of the foreign investors normally accounts for 20 % to 30 % of the total trading volume, and their behaviors have impact on the behavior of the local investors. And this seems to apply to the <b>closed</b> end <b>funds.</b> In the book “Irrational Exuberance”, Shiller (2000) raised the importance of the individuals’ sentiment on the stock price volatility. Vietnam is a new market which has lots of dividual investors. And their trading is influenced by the emotion This paper will show that the investors’ sentiment also play a part in driving the price of the funds as suggested by many literature on the <b>closed</b> end <b>funds</b> in the emerging markets...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to examine}} mutual fund investors 2 ̆ 7 {{response}} to mergers of Australian mutual fund companies. Design/methodology/approach – Two matching-control techniques are employed to analyse the impact of mergers on excess money {{in and out of}} open and <b>closed</b> <b>funds</b> involved in the transactions. The paper employs cross-sectional regression analyses to examine the impact of mergers on different types of parties to mergers. Findings – The results suggest that mergers are not accompanied by increased money flows. Instead investors withdraw from the target funds prior to and after the merger. Funds belonging to specialist mutual fund companies record more gains in assets under management than declines following mergers, and that money inflow gains at competing funds induce reductions of management expense ratios at target funds. Research limitations/implications – This paper studies mergers in only one industry in a single country. Future studies may extend to other industries and economies. Originality/value – This paper extends prior research on the flow effects of mergers at individual fund level by considering the issue at the corporate level...|$|E
