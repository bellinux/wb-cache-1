40|$|A {{scale and}} {{orientation}} adaptive mean shift tracking (SOAMST) {{algorithm is proposed}} in this study {{to address the problem}} of how to estimate the scale and orientation changes of the target under the mean shift tracking framework. In the original mean shift tracking algorithm, the position of the target can be well estimated, whereas the scale and orientation changes cannot be adaptively estimated. Considering that the weight image derived from the target model and the candidate model can represent the possibility that a pixel belongs to the target, the authors show that the original mean shift tracking algorithm can be derived using the zeroth- and the first-order moments of the weight image. With the zeroth-order moment and the Bhattacharyya coefficient between the target model and candidate model, a simple and effective method is proposed to estimate the scale of target. Then an approach, which utilises the estimated area and the second-order <b>centre</b> <b>moment,</b> is proposed to adaptively estimate the width, height and orientation changes of the target.

40|$|Remote sensing using {{terrestrial}} optical CCD cameras is {{a useful}} data-collection method for geophysical measurement in the near-shore zone, where in situ measurement is difficult and time consuming. In particular, optical video sensing of the variability in the visible spectrum from the sea surface due to the near-shore incident wave field is becoming an established method for distal measurement of near-shore sub-tidal morphology. We report {{on the use of}} a low-mounted shore-normal camera for gathering data on cross-shore dissipative characteristics of a dynamic, open beach. Data is analysed for the purposes of classifying three of Wright and Shorts’ intermediate classes of morphological beach state, as determined by expert raters. Although these beach states are usually thought of as being distinctive in terms of their longshore bar variability, theory predicts that differences should also be observed in cross-shore dissipative characteristics. Three methods of generating features from statistical features from the archived optical data are described and compared, in terms of their ability to discriminate between the beach states. The best performance was obtained using an pixel intensity percentile representation (which does not assume a Gaussian intensity distribution), which classified 85 % of the 284 cases correctly. Class <b>centre</b> <b>moment</b> profiles for each beach state were constructed, and results indicate that cross-shore wave dissipation becomes more disorganized as linear bars devolve into more complex transverse structures...|$|R
40|$|We produce {{fast and}} {{automatic}} moment tensor solutions for all moderate to strong earthquakes in the European-Mediterranean region. The procedure automatically screens near real-time earthquake alerts {{provided by a}} large number of agencies. Each event with magnitude M ≥ 4. 7 triggers an automatic request for near real-time data at several national and international data <b>centres.</b> <b>Moment</b> tensor inversion is performed using complete regional long-period (50 - 100 s) waveforms. Initially the data are inverted for a fixed depth to remove traces with a low signal-to-noise ratio. The remaining data are then inverted for several trial depths to find the best-fitting depth. Solutions are produced within 90 min of an earthquake. We analyse the results for the period 2000 April to 2002 April to evaluate the performance of the procedure. For quality assessment, we compared the results with the independent Swiss regional moment tensor catalogue (SRMT), and divided the 87 moment tensor solutions into three groups: 38 A-quality solutions with well-resolved Mw, depth and focal mechanism; 21 B-quality solutions with well-resolved Mw; and 28 unreliable C-quality solutions. The non-homogeneous station and event distributions, varying noise level, and inaccurate earthquake locations affected solution quality. For larger events (Mw ≥ 5. 5) we consistently obtained A-quality solutions. For Mw = 4. 5 - 5. 5 we obtained A- and B-quality solutions.

This paper explores some seemingly ‘hidden’ grammars within the AC:E to (re) discover their genesis and how they unfold across Foundation to Year 6. The first ‘Secret Squirrel’ <b>moment</b> <b>centres</b> on the introduction of a new grammar which weaves traditional Latin-based and Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) theory. The second ‘Secret Squirrel’ <b>moment</b> <b>centres</b> on the use of one sub-system of SFL Theory, the System of Appraisal, and its potential to provide an analytical lens for ‘reading’ the interpersonal meaning within narratives. The remainder of the paper draws on Goodson’s (1990) notion of curriculum as a social construction, paying attention to the levels of processes and (potential) practice. This part of the paper focuses on the System of Appraisal as it is introduced in the AC:E and then translates the Content Descriptions to an example analysis. One stimulus text, Melanie Watt’s (2012) children’s picture book ‘Scaredy Squirrel at the Beach’, is introduced then analysed using the System of Appraisal as an analytical lens for identifying how language choices ‘go to work’ (Macken-Horarik, 2003, p. 285) on readers, that is how Watt’s language choices are crafted so a ‘compliant’ child reader (Martin & White, 2005, p. 62) has the opportunity to ‘feel with’ and thus ‘adjudicate’ the behaviour of characters in particular ways (Macken-Horarik, 2003, p. 285) ...|$|R
