5|$|Leopoldii hybrids {{arose from}} the work of the British {{explorer}} and botanist Richard Pearce, an employee of James Veitch & Sons, a plant nursery. Pearce brought back specimens of Hippeastrum leopoldii and Hippeastrum pardinum from the Andes. These two species were notable for large flowers that were wide open and relatively symmetrical. Crossing these two species with the best of the Reginae strain produced a lineage of very large open flowered specimens, with up to 4-6 flowers on each scape. The Veitch nursery dominated the <b>commercial</b> <b>development</b> of Hippeastrum leopoldii and other varieties up to {{the early years of the}} twentieth century, the best of their hybrids setting the standard for modern <b>commercial</b> <b>development.</b>|$|E

There is also some residential and <b>commercial</b> <b>development</b> downstream of State Route 73.

5|$|A lead coffin in a rock-cut grave was {{discovered}} {{at a site}} adjacent to the Fosse Way in 1988. This discovery, and the impending <b>commercial</b> <b>development</b> of the site by the landowner, Showerings, led archaeologists to undertake more extensive excavations in the 1990s. The grave {{was part of a}} larger cemetery which contained 17 burials lying on a rough east-west alignment, indicating probable Christian adherence. Two other, smaller, cemeteries contained graves aligned north-south, possibly signifying pagan religious practices. One burial was in a substantial stone coffin which had been positioned beneath a mausoleum, the foundations of which remained.|$|E
5|$|A line to Horsham, {{now part}} of the Arun Valley Line, was opened on 14 February 1848. A station was {{provided}} next to Crawley High Street from that date.

5|$|Anderson's efforts helped spark renewed {{interest}} in the trail, and Avery (who led the charge after Perkinsâ€™ death in 1932) {{was able to bring}} other states on board. Upon taking over the ATC, Avery adopted the more practical goal of building a simple hiking trail. He and MacKaye clashed over the ATC's response to a major <b>commercial</b> <b>development</b> along the trail's path; MacKaye left the organization, while Avery was willing to simply reroute the trail. Avery reigned as Chairman of the ATC from 1932 to 1952 (he died that same year).|$|E
5|$|At Oregon's request, the U.S. Congress {{stripped}} the slough of its navigable status in 1978. This ended channel dredging on the slough, which {{could then be}} used for recreation. Other laws affecting the slough in the 1970s and beyond were the federal Clean Water Act and the Oregon Comprehensive Land Use Planning Act. In 1986, a business association began promoting <b>commercial</b> <b>development</b> along the upper slough, and the city later used urban renewal funds to support industrial projects near the airport. In 1996 the city acquired the Whitaker Ponds Natural Area, where it began a slough watershed education program for children.|$|E
5|$|At this point, PA 997 turns {{east for}} a short {{concurrency}} with US 30 on Lincoln Way East before turning north onto Black Gap Road. The road curves northwest and heads through wooded areas with some fields and homes. Farther northwest, the route runs through farmland with some residential and <b>commercial</b> <b>development,</b> and gains a center left-turn lane as it passes to the northeast of the Chambersburg Mall. PA 997 widens to a four-lane divided highway and comes to an intersection with the southern terminus of PA 696 and an interchange with I-81, with the ramps serving the northbound lanes of I-81 connecting to PA 696. Past this interchange, the route narrows to a two-lane undivided road and turns north and northwest through fields and woods to bypass the community of Scotland, coming to a bridge over Norfolk Southern's Lurgan Branch. The road curves west and then northwest and becomes Cumberland Highway, running through farmland with some woods and residential and <b>commercial</b> <b>development.</b> PA 997 comes to an intersection with US 11 {{in the community of}} Green Village, where PA 997 Truck heads south along US 11.

5|$|Following World War I, the British {{upper class}} was in decline as the reduced {{workforce}} meant servants were less in supply and demanded higher salaries. The grandest houses in Mayfair became {{more expensive to}} service and consequently many were converted to foreign embassies. The 2nd Duke of Westminster decided to demolish Grosvenor House and build Bourdon House in its place. Mayfair attracted <b>commercial</b> <b>development</b> after much of the City of London was destroyed during the Blitz, and many corporate headquarters were established in the area. Several historically important houses were demolished, including Aldford House, Londonderry House and Chesterfield House.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the pessimistic view of the south taken by the Khartoum administration, he was enthusiastic about the wealth and diversity of plants.

5|$|PA 997 {{begins at}} the Maryland state line in Washington Township, Franklin County, where the road {{continues}} south into that state as MD 64. From the state line, the route heads north-northwest as two-lane undivided Anthony Highway through farmland with some trees and homes. The road crosses the East Branch Little Antietam Creek and soon enters the borough of Waynesboro, where the name becomes State Hill Road, where it passes residences and <b>commercial</b> <b>development.</b> PA 997 curves northwest and immediately turns northeast onto Clayton Avenue, passing homes and coming to an intersection with PA 16. Here, the route turns northwest to form a concurrency with PA 16 on East Main Street, passing homes and businesses before continuing into the downtown area. At the center of town, PA 997 splits from PA 16 by turning northeast onto North Church Street, heading through more residential areas with a few businesses. The route leaves Waynesboro for Washington Township again and becomes Anthony Highway, passing more development before heading into a mix of farms and woods.

5|$|St. John's, and the {{province}} as a whole, was gravely affected in the 1990s {{by the collapse}} of the northern cod fishery, which had been the driving force of the provincial economy for hundreds of years. After a decade of high unemployment rates and depopulation, the city's proximity to the Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose oil fields led to an economic boom that spurred population growth and <b>commercial</b> <b>development.</b> As a result, the St. John's area now accounts for about half of {{the province}}'s economic output.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, <b>commercial</b> <b>development</b> {{and zoning}} spread along King Street and its cross streets. After several decades of decline, King Street has {{experienced}} a revival since 2005 following a successful streetscaping project. A popular beer bar that opened that year {{set the tone for}} later establishments, many of them craft beer oriented. Subsequently, the district has become the home of many bars, restaurants, stores, and night clubs, as well as an arts district and two craft breweries to the north. As a result of this growth, the King Street District emerged as Jacksonville's beer hub in the 2010s.|$|E
