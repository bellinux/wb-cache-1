Premature infants commonly require supplemental oxygen to treat complications of preterm birth.

5|$|All {{functions}} can {{be invoked}} by the mouse. Keys can also invoke the game setup, {{some of the}} menu options and some gameplay functions including scrolling and pausing the game. Players can select single units by clicking, and groups of up to four by shift-clicking or bandboxing. To move units, players can shift the mouse to select units on the main map, move to the unit menu to select an action, {{and then back to}} the main map or minimap to specify the target area; but shortcut keys <b>can</b> <b>eliminate</b> the middle mouse action in this cycle.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation VR is {{a virtual}} reality device that is {{produced}} by Sony Computer Entertainment. It features a 5.7 inch 1920x1080 resolution OLED display, and operates at 120fps which <b>can</b> <b>eliminate</b> blur and produce a smooth image; the device also has a low latency of less than 18ms. Additionally, it produces two sets of images, one being visible on a TV {{and one for the}} headset, and includes 3D audio technology so the player can hear from all angles. The PlayStation VR was released in October 2016.|$|E

5|$|The player {{touches the}} screen to move Adam Jensen, a protagonist from the stealth combat, cyber-dystopian Deus Ex series, between nodes on a {{hexagonal}} grid towards an exit. If moved to a specific node, the character will stealthily take down guards, hack computers, and activate his human augmentations, such as invisibility. Enemies who spot Jensen will move towards and, if they reach his node, eliminate him. Alternatively, Jensen <b>can</b> <b>eliminate</b> enemies if approached from behind or their side. In the game's story, which is set before the events of , Jensen's sole mission is to save an important person, but is continually set back by puzzles—54 in total.|$|E
5|$|Corvo defeats Daud and his assassins before {{traveling}} through Daud's territory {{and into the}} sewers where he finds Granny Rags attempting to cook Slackjaw. Corvo <b>can</b> <b>eliminate</b> either Slackjaw or Granny Rags, who is revealed to be a witch called Vera Moray. Corvo returns to the pub to find it overrun with guards and that Havelock has killed many of the Loyalists. He discovers where Havelock has taken Emily, and can save Piero, Sokolov and Callista. Corvo signals to Samuel, who ferries him to the former Lord Regent's lighthouse. He infiltrates the lighthouse and either subdues Pendleton and Martin or finds that Havelock, to ensure the Loyalists' actions are never known, has already killed them. Once finished with Havelock, Corvo {{may or may not}} rescue Emily. Havelock's journal reveals that the Lord Regent suspects that Emily is Corvo's daughter.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} iterations, no search {{algorithm}} that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst case performance than binary search. This {{is because the}} comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as each level is filled completely with nodes if there are enough. Otherwise, the search algorithm <b>can</b> <b>eliminate</b> few elements in an iteration, {{increasing the number of}} iterations required in the average and worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over all elements is affected. This problem is solved by binary search, as dividing the array in half ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.|$|E

Two types of mistakes were deemed most serious: errors committed during field operations, such as maintenance and testing, that can cause an accident; and human errors made during small accidents that cascade to complete failure.|$|E
25|$|A virus, S. invicta 1 (SINV-1), {{has been}} found in about 20% of fire ant fields, where it appears to cause the slow death of {{infected}} colonies. It has proven to be self-sustaining and transmissible. Once introduced, it <b>can</b> <b>eliminate</b> a colony within three months. Researchers believe the virus has potential as a viable biopesticide to control fire ants. Two more viruses have also been discovered: S. invicta 2 (SINV-2) and S. invicta 3 (SINV-3). Polygynous colonies tend to face greater infections in contrast to monogynous colonies. Multiple virus infections can also occur.|$|E

25|$|Biological invasions are {{composed}} of exotic biota that enter a landscape and replace species with which they share similarities in structure and ecological function. Because they multiply and grow quickly, invasive species <b>can</b> <b>eliminate</b> or greatly reduce existing flora and fauna by various mechanisms, such as direct competitive exclusion. Invasive species typically spread {{at a faster rate}} when they have no natural predators or when they fill an empty niche. These invasions often occur in a historical context and are classified as a type of human-mediated disturbance called human-mediated invasions.|$|E
25|$|Neoprene {{dry suits}} {{are made from}} a foam-rubber sheet {{containing}} tiny air bubbles, which provide insulation by themselves, and <b>can</b> <b>eliminate</b> {{the need for an}} under-suit, or greatly reduce the thickness needed for the under-fabric, but the bubbles in the neoprene are compressed and the insulation of the suit decreases with depth {{in the same way as}} for a wetsuit. Crushed neoprene provides the flexibility of neoprene with the consistent buoyancy and insulation of membrane suits. A neoprene wet suit can also be worn under a membrane dry suit for extra protection against condensation and leaks, but it will compress with depth as will any closed cell suit.|$|E

25|$|While {{performing}} {{experiments to}} test hypotheses, scientists {{may have a}} preference for one outcome over another, {{and so it is}} important to ensure that science as a whole <b>can</b> <b>eliminate</b> this bias. This can be achieved by careful experimental design, transparency, and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions. After the results of an experiment are announced or published, it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed, and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be. Taken in its entirety, the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users (especially the confirmation bias).|$|E
