40|$|Attributional ruletrees are {{proposed}} {{as an extension}} of the current ruleset representation used by AQ type learning. The ruletrees split a multiclass classification problem into separate subproblems using a <b>class</b> <b>splitting</b> attribute. The resulting representation can be graphically represented as a tree whose root is assigned the <b>class</b> <b>splitting</b> attribute, branches stemming from the root are values (or sets of values) determining subsets of classes, and leaves are assigned ruleset families for classifying events to classes in these subsets. The values on the branches from the root thus define preconditions for applying ruleset families. Ruletrees are easy to interpret and understand, and can be generated by a relatively simple modification of the AQ algorithm presented below. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for {{biomedical}} named entity recognition. To make the SVM training with the available largest corpus [...] the GENIA corpus [...] tractable, we propose to split the non-entity class into sub-classes, using part-of-speech information. In addition, we explore new features such as word cache and the states of an HMM trained by unsupervised learning. Experiments on the GENIA corpus show that our <b>class</b> <b>splitting</b> technique not only enables the training with the GENIA corpus but also improves the accuracy. The proposed new features also contribute to improve the accuracy. We compare our SVMbased recognition system with a system using Maximum Entropy tagging method...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new method for clustering data using a dynamic scheme. An appropriate partitioning is obtained based on both a dissimilarity measure between pairs of entities {{as well as}} a dynamic procedure of splitting. A dissimilarity function is defined by using the cost of the optimum path from a datum to each entity on a graph, with the cost of a path being defined as the greatest distance between two successive vertices on the path. The procedure of clustering is dynamic {{in the sense that the}} initial problem of determining a partition into an unknown number of natural groupings has been reduced to a sequence of only two <b>class</b> <b>splitting</b> stages. Having arisen from any particular application, the proposed approach could be effective for many domains, and it is especially successful to identify clusters if there is lack of prior knowledge about the data set. The usefulness of the dynamic algorithm to deal with elongated or nonpiecewise linear separable clusters as well as spar [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Protection {{of digital}} data from {{unauthorized}} access is of paramount importance. In {{the past several}} years, much research has concentrated on protecting data {{from the standpoint of}} confidentiality, integrity and availability. Software is a form of data with unique properties and its protection poses unique challenges. First, software can be reverse engineered, which may result in stolen intellectual property. Second, software can be altered with the intent of performing operations this software must not be allowed to perform. With commercial software increasingly distributed in forms from which source code can be easily extracted, such as Java bytecodes, reverse engineering has become easier than ever. Obfuscation techniques have been proposed to impede illegal reverse engineers. Obfuscations are program transformations that preserve the program functionality while obscuring the code, thereby protecting the program against reverse engineering. Unfortunately, the existing obfuscation techniques are limited to obscuring variable names, transformations of local control flow, and obscuring expressions using variables of primitive types. In this paper, we propose obfuscations of design of object-oriented programs. We describe three techniques for obfuscation of program design. The class coalescing obfuscation replaces several classes with a single class. The <b>class</b> <b>splitting</b> obfuscation replaces a single class with multiple classes, each responsible for a part of the functionality of the original class. The type hiding obfuscation uses the mechanism of interfaces in Java to obscure the types of objects manipulated by the program. We show the results of our initial experiments with a prototype implementation of these techniques...|$|E

5000|$|Sometimes it is {{unavoidable}} {{to have what}} is known as a 'split class': this is a class where one teacher takes it for some lessons and another teacher for other lessons. This can happen e.g. because no single teacher is available on all scheduled periods, or because no single teacher can take it without going over their maximum teaching load.Another definition for a <b>split</b> <b>class</b> is when a teacher must teach two different grade levels in one period (for example Grade 10 French and Grade 11 French). This often occurs with less popular subjects, which are not big enough to be made into separate <b>classes.</b> <b>Split</b> <b>classes</b> are generally deemed highly undesirable.|$|R
