40|$|The {{future of}} U. S. {{transport}} energy requirements and emissions is uncertain. Transport policy research has explored {{a number of}} scenarios {{to better understand the}} future characteristics of U. <b>S.</b> light-duty <b>vehicles.</b> Deterministic scenario analysis is, however, unable to identify the impact of uncertainty on the future U. <b>S.</b> <b>vehicle</b> fleet emissions and energy use. Variables determining the future fleet emissions and fuel use are inherently uncertain and thus the shortfall in understanding the impact of uncertainty on the future of U. S. transport needs to be addressed. This paper uses a stochastic technology and fleet assessment model to quantify the uncertainties in U. <b>S.</b> <b>vehicle</b> fleet emissions and fuel use for a realistic yet ambitious pathway which results in about a 50 % reduction in fleet GHG emissions in 2050. The results show the probability distribution of fleet emissions, fuel use, and energy consumption over time out to 2050. The expected value for the fleet fuel consumption is about 450 and 350 billion litres of gasoline equivalent with standard deviations of 40 and 80 in 2030 and 2050, respectively. The expected value for the fleet GHG emissions is about 1, 360 and 850 Mt CO 2 equivalent with standard deviation of 130 and 230 in 2030 and 2050 respectively. The parameters that are major contributors to variations in emissions and fuel consumption are also identified and ranked through the uncertainty analysis. It is further shown that these major contributors change over time, an...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} an export model where consumers differentiate between {{different types of}} automobiles by the distance they can travel on one dollar’s worth of fuel. The model predicts that the overall demand for vehicles falls as crude oil prices rise, and that the demand for less fuel-efficient vehicles falls relatively more. In particular, we estimate that between 2007 and 2008, when the crude oil prices increased by 32 percent, the export demand for the SUVs manufactured in the United States declined by over $ 700 million. This implies that the relatively less fuel-efficient U. <b>S.</b> -model <b>vehicles</b> will tend to suffer a competitive disadvantage worldwide when crude oil prices are high.

On three occasions, the motor vehicle industry has changed the fundamental ideas on the process of manufacturing, and, perhaps more significantly, on how humans work together to create value. Under Fordism and Taylorism, the conditions of employment at the assembly lines became less and less bearable for the workers, and this resulted in an ongoing confrontation between management and the workforce, led by United Auto Workers (UAW). This confrontation resulted in escalating labor costs for the U. <b>S.</b> motor <b>vehicle</b> companies, and undermined their capacity to compete with the Japanese motor vehicle companies, who had developed a lean production system and a more humanistic management style.

40|$|Biotic {{interactions}} will modulate species' {{responses to}} climate change. Many approaches to predicting {{the impacts of}} climate change on biodiversity {{so far have been}} based purely on a climate envelope approach and have not considered direct and indirect species interactions. Using a long-term observational data set (> 30 years) of competing intertidal barnacle species, we built a hierarchy of age-structured two-taxa population models (Semibalanus balanoides vs. Chthamalus montagui and C. stellatus combined as one taxon) to test if the presence of a dominant competitor can mediate climatic influence on the subordinate species. Models were parameterized using data from populations on the south coast of southwest England and verified by hindcasting using independent north coast population data. Recruitment of the dominant <b>competitor,</b> <b>S.</b> balanoides, is driven by temperature. The mechanisms of competition explored included simple space preemption and temperature-driven interference competition. The results indicate that interspecific competition between juvenile barnacles is important in regulating chthamalid density but not that of the dominant <b>competitor</b> <b>S.</b> balanoides. Simulations were carried out using alternative future climate scenarios to predict barnacle population abundance over the next century. Under all emission scenarios, the cold-water S. balanoides is predicted to virtually disappear from southwest England by the 2050 s, leading to the competitive release of Chthamalus throughout the entire region and thereby substantially increasing its abundance and occupied habitat (by increasing vertical range on the shore). Our results demonstrate that climate change can profoundly affect the abundance and distribution of species through both the direct effects of temperature on survival, and also by altering important negative interactions through shifting competitive balances and essentially removing dominant competitors or predators. Climate change impacts on organisms are unlikely to lead only to straightforward, easily predictable changes in population size and distribution. The complex, indirect effects of climate change need {{to be taken into account}} if we are to accurately forecast the long-term effects of global warming...|$|R
