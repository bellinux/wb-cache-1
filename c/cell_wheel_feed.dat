The ball rotational speed which is controlled by the ultrasonic regulator has a great impact on final sphericity, and the speed controlled by the ultrasonic shoe dominates the whole processing time.

50|$|In {{the food}} sector, moving or {{transporting}} fluids is achieved {{with the aid}} of pump technology. Colloquially, this is known as filling or portioning. Various different types of pumps are used, {{depending on the type of}} filling products to be moved. Vacuum fillers with vane cell feed systems and vacuum feeding are commonly used for viscous products. The products are transported {{with the aid of}} a hopper with a feeding device, a vane cell feed system under a vacuum and appropriate volume expulsion in the pump housing. This is basically a volumetric feed principle, which means that a certain weight is defined via a volume. In addition to the vane cell feed systems, also known as rotary vane pumps, there are also screw feed systems with <b>feed</b> augers, toothed <b>wheel</b> <b>feed</b> systems and evacuated lifting cylinders. With all these systems, transportation is achieved via volume expulsion under a vacuum.Vacuum fillers are traditionally used in the meat processing industry as well as in other food sectors.

40|$|Abstract. Grinding-hardening is a thermo-mechanical process {{capable of}} {{simultaneous}} material removal and surface enhancement. However, there are difficulties {{in dealing with}} cylindrical workpieces, because of the complex 3 D-helical movement of the grinding-induced heat source. This paper investigates the effects of some key grinding parameters on the profile and microstructure variations of the hardened layer generated by a traverse cylindrical grinding, both experimentally and numerically. It {{was found that the}} ratio of the longitudinal <b>wheel</b> <b>feed</b> to the rotational speed of the workpiece R is most influential on the hardened layer profile. A larger R results in a thicker hardened layer but a more pronounced discontinuity of two adjacent hardening zones. Although a smaller R yields a relatively thinner hardened layer, the non-uniformity could be minimised by the overlapping of the grinding heating. The microstructure of the hardened layer can be altered by the tempering in subsequent grinding heating. A thermal analysis with the aid of the finite element method in conjunction with an experimental microstructural examination showed that the temperature distribution in the tempered region would lead to a variation of the precipitated carbide, and that a higher tempering temperature could result in a higher degree of the carbide precipitation and a more significant reduction of hardness...|$|R
50|$|The {{machine gun}} feeds from the {{left-hand}} side {{through a variety}} of disintegrating ammunition belt types: the American M13 linked belt, the German DM6 counterpart to the M13 or the segmented German DM1 belt. The ratcheting <b>wheel</b> <b>feed</b> unit was designed as an easily removable module that is inserted into the bottom portion of the feed block (installed in place of the standard magazine well), below the barrel axis. As a result of this configuration (the bolt passes over the belt), the ammunition belt is aligned upside down compared to most other belt-fed weapons (that is, the links face downward). The feed mechanism is actuated by the reciprocating movement of the bolt; a curved cam slot {{on the bottom of the}} bolt engages an actuator in the feed mechanism, rotating the double sprockets and positioning a new round in the feed path. Simple conversion from belt to magazine feed is possible by installing an adapter in the feed block which enables the use of H&K’s proprietary 20-round box magazine (from the G3 rifle) or a 50-round drum magazine. The HK21 uses a modified G3 receiver that has been extended to the front sight base and is equipped with a detachable bipod (mounted either in front of the feed mechanism or at the muzzle) and tripod and vehicle mounting points. The HK21 has close to a 48% parts interchangeability with the G3.|$|R

[...] At Dolaucothi, a similar discovery was made in 1935 during mining operations, and it included part of a reverse overshot water-wheel which {{is now in the}} National Museum of Wales. It was found with burnt timbers, suggesting that fire-setting was used to help break up the hard quartz in which the gold was trapped. A similar but larger wheel was rediscovered during mine operations at Rio Tinto in Spain, and is now in the British Museum, where it is displayed prominently in the Roman gallery. The Spanish example included a sequence of no fewer than 16 reverse overshot water-wheels, each pair of <b>wheels</b> <b>feeding</b> water to the next set in the sequence. Each wheel would have been worked like a treadwheel, from the side rather than at the top, {{but it would have been}} a hard and lonely activity for the miners working these wheels lifting water from the mine bottom.

Gold mining was sophisticated and technologically advanced at Dolaucothi, suggesting that the Roman army itself pioneered exploitation at the site. The construction of such dewatering machines is described by the Roman engineer Vitruvius writing in 25 BC, and their use for irrigation and lifting water in thermae was widespread.|$|R

40|$|When {{studying}} terramechanics for wheeled vehicles it {{is important}} to understand the tyre-terrain interaction. However the tyre road interface is hidden from view by the terrain and tyre itself. This makes determining the interaction externally very difficult. Some progress has been made by embedding sensors in the terrain or the tyre carcass however these techniques only capture a very small number of points. The problem of measuring dynamic tyre deformation at the tyre road interface from inside the tyre has been tackled in previous papers, however in this paper we seek to extend these measurements to identify the impact that rolling tyres have on the terrain. This is accomplished by measuring the undeformed soil profile in front of a tyre, the carcass deformation inside the tyre and the deformed soil profile behind the tyre. Test data was captured with the so-called Tyre–Terrain Camera System (T 2 CAM) on the Terramechanics rig at Virginia Tech using prepared sandy loam as the deformed soil material. T 2 CAM consists of three calibrated stereo camera rigs, a six-component load <b>cell,</b> <b>wheel</b> angle sensor and wheel speed sensor. Computer vision techniques are used with the images to generate full three dimensional profiles of the two soil areas and the inside surface of the tyre as captured by the cameras.
