25|$|Over {{his final}} {{three years in}} {{first-class}} cricket, and, by this time, in his early-thirties, Wood played only infrequently. Following a <b>couple</b> of expensive <b>bowling</b> spells, he found {{himself out of the}} first-class team.|$|R
40|$|Cina ̶ Indovino in attesa de clienti. A man {{is shown}} {{seated at a}} small table covered with a {{decorative}} cloth. A container holding brushes and a <b>couple</b> of <b>bowls</b> {{can be seen on}} the table. The following information is printed {{on the back of the}} card: “’Aiutare le Missioni è nostro dovere di Cattolici e di Italiani’. Rivolgersi a Istuto Missioni Estere - Parma. Serie XVI – Cina – Piccoli mestieri. 10. Indovino in attesa di client. ” There are a few lines of handwriting in Italian on the back...|$|R
5000|$|There {{were three}} dining areas that had kitchens. At first, there were twelve refrigerators, {{but they were}} {{eventually}} taken by the Japanese for their personal use. Internees were sent meat from an army slaughterhouse; it was brought through the compound by train. This meat was unrefrigerated and many times kept uncovered. The only equipment left over or given to the internees was two large frying pans, two copper pots, some tin pails, a dozen knives and a <b>couple</b> of <b>bowls.</b> [...] Most of the other remaining kitchen equipment was items that the internees were allowed to bring with them into the camp.|$|R
5|$|During the 1930s, several {{economic}} and climatic conditions combined with disastrous results for South Dakota. A lack of rainfall, extremely high temperatures and inappropriate cultivation techniques produced {{what was known}} as the Dust Bowl in South Dakota and several other plains states. Fertile topsoil was blown away in massive dust storms, and several harvests were completely ruined. The experiences of the Dust <b>Bowl,</b> <b>coupled</b> with local bank foreclosures and the general economic effects of the Great Depression, resulted in many South Dakotans leaving the state. The population of South Dakota declined by more than 7% between 1930 and 1940.|$|R
5000|$|The Act {{also gave}} {{directives}} to conserve {{the soil in}} the [...] "high plains" [...] - soil that was being raised into huge dust bowls during the 1930s. This period, known as the Dust <b>Bowl,</b> <b>coupled</b> with the economic hardships of the Great Depression, hit farmers particularly hard. The act attempted to correct earlier government policy that encouraged farmers to use their land without concern to the repercussions. The result of these agricultural methods (mostly the way farmers plowed their land) made it vulnerable to the winds. The dry ground, now exposed, rose up to create the [...] "black storms".|$|R
25|$|After the 2015 Cricket World Cup, Misbah-ul-Haq and Shahid Afridi {{ended their}} ODI careers. As a result, the {{captaincy}} of the ODI team {{was given to}} newcomer Azhar Ali. Under his captaincy, Pakistan played their first ODI series against Bangladesh. The tour was a disappointment and Pakistan lost all three ODIs {{as well as the}} T20 match. Clever <b>bowling</b> <b>coupled</b> with wonderful batting and fielding allowed the hosts to stroll past the visitors. This was Bangladesh's first win against Pakistan since the 1999 Cricket World Cup and first ever series win over Pakistan. However, Pakistan ended the tour on a positive with a 1–0 win in the two match test series.|$|R
5000|$|Besides high viewership {{ratings in}} South Korea, the series also {{proved to be}} {{successful}} in China, where it became the most expensive Korean drama sold at [...] per episode until it was surpassed by Descendants of the Sun in 2016. It also {{became one of the most}} viewed streaming shows on Chinese platform iQiyi, where it was streamed more than 14.5 billion times from December 2013 to February 2014. The series struck up a craze for chimaek (chicken and maekju), a popular Korean snack of chicken and beer, which is the favorite snack of the female protagonist. Despite declining chicken consumption in China due to fear of H7N9 bird flu, fried chicken restaurants in cities saw an increase in orders since the running of the show. Meanwhile, Korean instant noodle maker Nongshim said sales in January and February 2014 ― while the drama aired ― rose to a record high in its more than 15-year history of business in China; this, too, was attributed to a scene in the drama where the <b>couple</b> enjoyed a <b>bowl</b> of noodles on a trip.|$|R
50|$|Hunzahúa, heir of Idacansás, was a cacique in {{the sacred}} valley of the iraca and was chosen by the other caciques of the region to make peace between the battling parties. He became the first zaque of the {{northern}} Muisca region based in Hunza, present-day Tunja, {{and one of his}} policies was the ban on the use of weapons. According to Muisca scholar Javier Ocampo López, who wrote extensively about the religion and mythology of the Muisca, his mother was named Faravita and his sister Noncetá. Legend tells that Hunzahúa fell in love with his sister and made her his wife when he left Hunza for Chipatá. Faravita, the mother of the zaque, disagreed with the marriage of her two children and attacked the <b>couple,</b> spilling a <b>bowl</b> of chicha. This created the Hunzahúa Well. When Hunzahúa saw what his mother had done, and the Muisca protesting against his incest, he damned Hunza and the surrounding valley. Noncetá gave birth to a son in Susa, but the young boy turned into a rock. The sad couple traveled further, to the Tequendama Falls. Here, they changed into two rocks at either side of the sacred waterfall.|$|R
5000|$|The Dust Bowl was {{a series}} of dust storms caused by a massive drought that began in 1930 and lasted until 1941. The effect of the drought {{combined}} with the effects of the Great Depression, forced many farmers off the land throughout the Great Plains. The several economic and climatic conditions combined with disastrous results. A lack of rainfall, extremely high temperatures and over-cultivation of farmland produced what was known as the Dust Bowl in several other plains states. Fertile topsoil was blown away in massive dust storms, and several harvests were completely ruined. The experiences of the Dust <b>Bowl,</b> <b>coupled</b> with local bank foreclosures and the general economic effects of the Great Depression resulted in many leaving the region. The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, photographs by Dorothea Lange, and songs of Woody Guthrie tales of woe from the era. The negative images of the [...] "Okie" [...] as a sort of rootless migrant laborer living in a near-animal state of scrounging for food greatly offended many Oklahomans. These works often mix the experiences of former sharecroppers of the western American South with those of the exodusters fleeing the fierce dust storms of the High Plains. Although they primarily feature the extremely destitute, {{the vast majority of the}} people, both staying in and fleeing the region, suffered great poverty in the Depression years.|$|R
40|$|High {{levels of}} machine noise result in health issues {{for those people}} exposed to the machine for {{extended}} periods. Machine noise is becoming a more significant design consideration, often because of legislative requirements. Decanting centrifuges are machines with a rotating bowl. They {{have a number of}} noise sources, the most significant being structural noise, vortex/turbulence noise and siren noise. Due to the size, mass and speed of the rotating bowl, the bowl is the main source of structural noise. The structural noise is produced by all surfaces that are directly <b>coupled</b> to the <b>bowl’s</b> bearings. Due to the speed of rotation of the bowl, the turbulence from the various trailing edges generates broad spectrum vortex noise. Siren noise due to air flow through the bowl also generates significant noise especially at the lower harmonics of the bowl rotation frequency. Strategies to reduce decanter machine noise include: •	Decoupling the surfaces of the from the main bearings of the rotating bowl and hence reduce the amount of structurally transmitted noise. •	Smoothing the surface of the bowl to minimise the edges that produce vortices that are shed and produce vortex/turbulence noise. •	As siren noise is produced due to flow through the rotating bowl, which is integral to the function of the decanter, the exit ports should be designed so that the noise is produced within parts of the sound spectrum that have low noise levels...|$|R
