40|$|Objectives: Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the complex relationship among asthma control, sleep problems, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among children with asthma. This study aimed to test the longitudinal effect of asthma <b>control</b> <b>status</b> on asthma-specific HRQOL through the mechanism of nighttime sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. Methods: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS (R)) Pediatric Asthma Study included 229 dyads of asthmatic {{children and their parents}} with two years of follow-up for assessing the change in asthma control, sleep problems, and asthma-specific HRQOL. The Asthma Control and Communication Instrument was used to measure asthma <b>control</b> <b>status.</b> Nighttime sleep quality assessment was based on difficulty falling asleep and getting up, and sleep disturbance. The Iowa Pediatric Daytime Sleeping Scale was used to assess daytime sleepiness. The PROMIS Asthma Impact Scale was used to measure asthma-specific HRQOL. Multilevel structural equation modeling was performed to quantify the direct and indirect effects of asthma <b>control</b> <b>status</b> on asthma-specific HRQOL through nighttime sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. Results: Poorer asthma <b>control</b> <b>status</b> was directly associated with lower asthma-specific HRQOL at within-subject and between-subject levels (p 3 ̆c 0. 05); however, effects of asthma control on asthma-specific HRQOL were indirectly influenced through daytime sleepiness at the within-subject level (p 3 ̆c 0. 05), and through nighttime sleep quality and daytime sleepiness at the between-subject level (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Conclusions: Asthma <b>control</b> <b>status</b> is associated with asthma-specific HRQOL, and this association is mediated by nighttime sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. Clinicians should address sleep problems related to asthma control to improve HRQOL for asthmatic children. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
