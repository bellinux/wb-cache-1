40|$|The Monterey <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> (Essigella californica) was accidentally {{introduced}} into Australia {{from the northern}} hemisphere before being detected in Canberra in 1998. Feeding on some members of Pinaceae, including the commercially important Pinus radiata, the aphid has now spread to almost all pine-growing areas and {{is considered to be}} an important forestry pest. In 2005, a project was commissioned to import the <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> parasitoid, Diaeretus essigellae, into Australia and subject it to host-specificity testing with a view to releasing it as a biological control for E. californica. In 2007, the first wasp pupae arrived at Australian quarantine facilities and emergent adults were used to establish an ongoing Australian culture. Sequencing of 28 S rDNA confirmed the identity of the parasitoid and showed that its closest known relative is Diaeretus leucopterus. No-choice and choice host-specificity testing was conducted using Monterey <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> and eight non-target aphid species as potential hosts for D. essigellae. Regardless of the testing procedure, E. californica was the only species that was successfully parasitised. This suggests that D. essigellae is highly specific (at genus or species level) and therefore, is a suitable candidate for release into pine plantations to provide control of Monterey <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> in Australia. Based on these data, permission to release the wasp from quarantine was granted in November 2009. Although 24 aphidiine parasitoids have been purposely or accidentally introduced to Australia, this is only the second species to have undergone host-specificity testing and in addition, is the first species released to parasitise a member of the most primitive aphid subfamily, Lachninae. This case study raises interesting questions about the basis for development/analysis of host-specificity testing of putatively highly specific biocontrol agents where close relatives of their targets either do not exist in the environment or are pests themselves.

Although common chemical and physical strategies are used to prevent the disease caused by C. pinitabulaeformis Zhang et Zhang, new strategies based on biological and/or genetic approaches are promising to control and eradicate the disease. However, there is no information about genomics, proteomics or transcriptomics to allow the design of new control strategies for this <b>pine</b> <b>aphid.</b> We used next generation sequencing technology to sequence the transcriptome of C. pinitabulaeformis Zhang et Zhang and built a transcriptome database.

The new venture, with funding from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), covers Kenya, Tanzania Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Zaire, Zimbabwe and Zambia.

The cypress aphid is becoming such a major pest in Kenya's forests that the search for likely predators has moved as far as the Rocky Mountains in America.
