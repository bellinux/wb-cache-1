25|$|The United States Air Corps {{wanted the}} {{aircraft}} to perform high altitude research and {{to test the}} feasibility of a pressurized cabin. The Corps contracted with Lockheed Aircraft Corporation to produce the aircraft at a total cost of $112,197. The requirements called for an aircraft capable of flying at no less than 25,000ft (7,620m) and having an endurance of ten hours {{with at least two}} hours above 25,000ft (7,620m). Major Carl Greene and John Younger, both structures experts who worked for the Air Corps Engineering Division at Wright Field in Ohio were responsible for the design of the pressurized cabin structure. Greene and Younger worked with Lockheed to modify a Model 10 Electra with a new fuselage consisting of a circular cross-section that was able to withstand up to a 10psi differential. New, smaller windows were used to prevent a possible blowout while operating at high pressure differentials. The cabin pressurization was provided by bleeding air from the engines' turbo supercharger, the compressor outlet fed into the cabin and was controlled by the flight engineer. This system was able to maintain a <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> of 12,000ft (3,658m) while flying at 30,000ft (9,144m). The fuselage was divided into two compartments, a forward pressurized compartment, and an aft unpressurized compartment. The forward compartment housed two pilots, a flight engineer, and up to two passengers. The aft compartment provided accommodation for one passenger and could be used only at low altitudes since it lacked pressurization.|$|E

Altitude chamber experiments at such medium altitudes have shown a higher than expected incidence of decompression sickness.

40|$|Maximum <b>cabin</b> {{pressure}} <b>altitude</b> {{is limited}} by regulation to 2440 m (8 kft) for normal flight. In case of cabin depressurization, the <b>cabin</b> pressure <b>altitude</b> may rapidly increase up to maximum A/C altitude.

The corresponding airworthiness requirement CS/FAR 25. 1443 (c) defines the minimum performance in term of oxygen partial pressure in the trachea. For demonstration, international standards have been available (TSO C 64 a / SAE AS 8025) for several decades. 	More than the oxygen partial pressure in the trachea, the blood oxygen saturation is the most relevant parameter to characterize the level of oxygenation. Current medical instrumentation are available for measuring directly the blood oxygen saturation. This alternative means of demonstration has been systematically studied during a test campaign at the DLR – Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne with human testing in altitude chamber. Different types of oxygen dispensing devices have been tested at different altitudes. Results show that the oxygenation level required by the regulation is achieved with significantly less oxygen than used so far. This is explained by the different efficiency level of oxygen transfer to the blood during the different phases of the breathing process. In other words, {{it is important to}} deliver oxygen at the right time, so that oxygen is effectively transferred to the blood and not “wasted” during subsequent exhalation. In the last years, this alternative means of compliance has been accepted by the Airworthiness Authorities.

50|$|In airliners, <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> during {{flight is}} kept {{above sea level}} {{in order to reduce}} stress on the {{pressurized}} part of the fuselage; this stress is proportional to the difference in pressure inside and outside the cabin.

In 2002 the British Thoracic Society published recommendations for adults and children with respiratory disease planning air travel, with a web update in 2004. New full recommendations and a summary were published in 2011, containing key recommendations {{for the assessment of}} high-risk patients and identification of those likely to require in-flight supplemental oxygen. This paper highlights the aspects of particular relevance to primary care practitioners with the following key points: (1) At <b>cabin</b> <b>altitudes</b> of 8000 feet (the usual upper limit of in-flight cabin pressure, equivalent to 0. 75 atmospheres) the partial pressure of oxygen falls to the equivalent of breathing 15. 1 % oxygen at sea level. Arterial oxygen tension falls in all passengers; in patients with respiratory disease, altitude may worsen preexisting hypoxaemia. (2) Altitude exposure also influences the volume of any air in cavities, where pressure x volume remain constant (Boyle's law), so that a pneumothorax or closed lung bulla will expand and may cause respiratory distress. Similarly, barotrauma may affect the middle ear or sinuses if these cavities fail to equilibrate. (3) Patients with respiratory disease require clinical assessment and advice before air travel to: (a) optimise usual care; (b) consider contraindications to travel and possible need for in-flight oxygen; (c) consider the need for secondary care referral for further assessment; (d) discuss the risk of venous thromboembolism; and (e) discuss forward planning for the journey...|$|R

With long haul flights, passengers are exposed to <b>cabin</b> <b>altitudes</b> of up to 8000 feet for many hours. Long flights are associated with increased risks of in-flight medical incidents related to hypoxia or to prolonged immobility. No resting measures of lung function (including oxygen saturations at sea level and forced expiratory volume in one second, FEV 1) reliably predict hypoxaemia or complications. 1 - 5 In 2002 the British Thoracic Society (BTS) published recommendations for adults and children with respiratory disease planning air travel, 6 with a web update in 2004. 7 New full recommendations 8 and a summary 9 were published in 2011, containing key recommendations {{for the assessment of}} high-risk patients and identification of those likely to require in-flight supplemental oxygen.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundFor {{patients}} with cystic fibrosis (CF) -related partial respiratory insufficiency and reduced arterial oxygen tension at ground level, the mild hypobaric environment on commercial jet aircraft poses {{the risk of}} severe hypoxemia. Thus, physicians {{should be able to}} estimate the extent of in-flight hypoxia. ObjectivesTo derive tools for estimating the expected drop in arterial oxygen partial pressure (paO 2) and oxygen saturation (saO 2) in young adult CF {{patients with}} mild to moderate airway obstruction during exposure to the hypobaric conditions aboard commercial aircraft and to test the predictive power of a hypobaric chamber simulation. MethodsBlood gases of 12 CF patients were measured at ground level, at two altitudes in a hypobaric chamber (2000 and 3000  m) and during two 3. 5 -h flights at <b>cabin</b> <b>altitudes</b> of 1855  m and 1700  m. The altitude dependence of paO 2 and saO 2 in the chamber and during the flights was calculated and results were used to derive estimation equations for in-flight values. ResultsIn the chamber, saO 2 decreased by 0. 33 % per 100  m vertical ascent, and this rate increased significantly at altitudes > 2000  m. Predicted saO 2 differed from in-flight value by < 5 %, and agreement between in-flight saO 2 decrease rate and chamber data was good. paO 2 decreased at a rate of 0. 99  mm Hg/ 100  m in the chamber and by 1. 33  mm Hg/ 100  m during flights. None of the subjects showed any clinical symptoms during the flights and the chamber simulation. ConclusionDuring our worst-case scenario, i. e. the hypobaric chamber simulation at 3000  m, 90 % of patients tolerated paO 2 values below the commonly recommended threshold of 50 mm Hg, probably due to adaptation to chronic hypoxemia and lung function impairment. We propose the following equations for an estimation of the expected extent of in-flight hypoxemia in CF patients with mild to moderate airway obstruction and a flight duration of up to 3. 5 h:–paO 2 [Alt]=paO 2 [ground]− 1. 33 ×Alt [mm Hg], and–saO 2 [Alt]=saO 2 [ground]− 0. 33 ×Alt [%], with Alt=altitude in 100  m. In addition to the overall clinical situation of a patient, these equations will serve as a practical supportive tool for the assessment of the fitness to fly in the primary care setting...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{evaluated}} {{a variety}} of non-invasive physiological technologies {{and a series of}} test approaches for examination of aviator performances under conditions of mental workload in order to provide a standard real-time test for physiological and psychological pilot fatigue assessments. METHODS: Twenty-one male aviators were selected for a simulated flight in a hypobaric <b>cabin</b> with artificial <b>altitude</b> conditions of 2400 meter above sea level. The simulated flight lasted for 1. 5 h, and was repeated for two times with an intervening 0. 5 h rest period outside the hypobaric cabin. Subjective criteria (a fatigue assessment instrument [FAI]) and objective criteria (a standing-position balance test as well as a critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF) test) were used for fatigue evaluations. RESULTS: No significant change was observed in the FAI scores before and after the simulated flight, indicating that there was no subjective fatigue feeling among the participants. However, significant differences were observed in the standing-position balance and CFF tests among the subjects, suggesting that psychophysiological indexes can reflect mental changes caused by workload to a certain extent. The CFF test was the simplest and clearly indicated the occurrence of workload influences on pilot performances after a simulated flight. CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that the CFF test was the easiest way to detect workload caused mental changes after a simulated flight in a hypobaric cabin and reflected the psychophysiological state of aviators. We suggest that this test might be used as an effective routine method for evaluating the workload influences on mental conditions of aviators...|$|R
