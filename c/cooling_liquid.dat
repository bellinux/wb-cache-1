5|$|On 24 July, the {{squadron}} {{moved to a}} satellite airfield at Rochford in the county of Essex. The following day, he became operational. The Battle of Britain was slowly escalating and air fighting increased {{with a series of}} German air attacks against British shipping in the English Channel, a phase of the battle termed Kanalkampf by the Luftwaffe. Finucane's first scramble came on 25 July 1940. Flying Spitfire N3128 code YT-W, he took off at 08:45. The Spitfire was worn, having served in combat since April. It developed a glycol leak whilst climbing and the cockpit filled with escaping vapour from the <b>cooling</b> <b>liquid</b> condensing on the hot engine. Suddenly his radio transmission failed. Still, he managed a wheels-up landing at Rochford. 65 Squadron was in action again at 12:20 and engaged enemy aircraft but suffered no losses.|$|E
5|$|In 1666, Isaac Newton {{observed}} the Sun's light using a prism, {{and showed that}} it {{is made up of}} light of many colors. In 1800, William Herschel discovered infrared radiation beyond the red part of the solar spectrum. The 19th century saw advancement in spectroscopic studies of the Sun; Joseph von Fraunhofer recorded more than 600 absorption lines in the spectrum, the strongest of which are still often referred to as Fraunhofer lines. In {{the early years of the}} modern scientific era, the source of the Sun's energy was a significant puzzle. Lord Kelvin suggested that the Sun is a gradually <b>cooling</b> <b>liquid</b> body that is radiating an internal store of heat. Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz then proposed a gravitational contraction mechanism to explain the energy output, but the resulting age estimate was only 20 million years, well short of the time span of at least 300 million years suggested by some geological discoveries of that time. In 1890 Joseph Lockyer, who discovered helium in the solar spectrum, proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the Sun.|$|E
2500|$|The Goshawk was {{developed}} from the Kestrel IV prototype engine, to use evaporative (also known as [...] "steam") cooling. Rather than keep the <b>cooling</b> <b>liquid</b> below its boiling point in the cooling system, the coolant was allowed to boil; the phase change from liquid to vapour takes more heat from the engine, so less coolant is needed. However, instead of a radiator to take {{the heat from the}} coolant, a condensor was required to turn the vapour back to liquid. This had to be much larger than a radiator and added drag to the aircraft design.|$|E
50|$|There {{were three}} basic cooling configurations: fan <b>cooled,</b> CPU <b>liquid</b> <b>cooled,</b> and both CPU and GPU <b>liquid</b> <b>cooled.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Industrial {{cooling towers}} {{can be used}} to remove heat from various sources such as {{machinery}} or heated process material. [...] The primary use of large, industrial cooling towers is to remove the heat absorbed in the circulating cooling water systems used in power plants, petroleum refineries, petrochemical plants, natural gas processing plants, food processing plants, semi-conductor plants, and for other industrial facilities such as in condensers of distillation columns, for <b>cooling</b> <b>liquid</b> in crystallization, etc. The circulation rate of cooling water in a typical 700 MW coal-fired power plant with a cooling tower amounts to about 71,600 cubic metres an hour (315,000 US gallons per minute) and the circulating water requires a supply water make-up rate of perhaps 5 percent (i.e., 3,600 cubic metres an hour).|$|E
60|$|When Herbert {{had been}} down to Hammersmith and seen his father, {{he came back}} to me at our chambers, and devoted the day to {{attending}} on me. He was the kindest of nurses, and at stated times took off the bandages, and steeped them in the <b>cooling</b> <b>liquid</b> that was kept ready, and put them on again, with a patient tenderness that I was deeply grateful for.|$|E
60|$|What {{happened}} next {{he did not}} remember, having only a hazy recollection of tossing in burning torment for an interminable space, during which at intervals somebody held a glass filled with <b>cooling</b> <b>liquid</b> to his lips, while now and then gentle hands, whose touch was soothing, raised his aching head. Still, he fancied that at times a white face bent over him, and once, when {{the dim light of}} a calabash lamp beat into his eyes, that waves of dusky hair drooped close above his forehead, and that he caught, and held fast with all his strength, the cool fingers that slipped into his own. They seemed to draw him back out of the black abyss into which he was sliding; and, he surmised afterward, they actually did so.|$|E

40|$|International audienceModern {{electrochemical}} methods, {{especially the}} cyclic voltammetry, {{have been used}} to investigate the sensitivity to pitting corrosion of aluminum 3003 (AlMn 1 alloy) in specific <b>cooling</b> <b>liquids</b> in the automotive industry. The influence of two corrosion inhibitors specific to the <b>cooling</b> <b>liquids</b> glaceol A and glaceol D has been studied. Other factors such as temperature and addition of distribution water have also been investigated. The surface of the cyclic voltamperograme curves and the difference between the pitting potential and the repassivation potential {{have been used to}} evaluate the inhibitory capacity of the corrosion inhibitors...|$|R

50|$|Apple's Power Mac G5 was {{the first}} {{mainstream}} desktop computer to have water cooling as standard (although only on its fastest models). Dell followed suit by shipping their XPS computers with <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling,</b> using thermoelectric cooling to help <b>cool</b> the <b>liquid.</b> Currently, Dell's only computers to offer <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> are their Alienware desktops.|$|R
50|$|The CMP wore {{a simpler}} cotton fabric union suit called the Constant Wear Garment (CWG) {{underneath}} the TSLA {{instead of the}} water <b>cooled</b> <b>Liquid</b> <b>Cooling</b> Garment. His cooling came directly from the flow of oxygen into his suit via an umbilical from the spacecraft environmental control system. When not performing lunar EVA's, the LMP and CDR also wore a CWG instead of the LCG.|$|R
50|$|Usually {{the scanner}} beam also {{contains}} all the cables and the air, <b>cooling</b> <b>liquid</b> and protection gas pipes. The {{base of the}} scanner beam contains elements that dampen vertical vibration.|$|E
50|$|A less typical {{action was}} an air bridge from Moscow to the Stalingrad area in November 1942, in order to quickly deliver {{antifreeze}} <b>cooling</b> <b>liquid</b> for tanks, {{during the battle of}} Stalingrad.|$|E
50|$|Marcel Audiffren, was a French priest, physicist, and {{inventor}} who {{promoted the}} residential refrigerator. He served as abbot of his Cistercian monastery, and originally designed a hand-cranked device for <b>cooling</b> <b>liquid,</b> such as wine, for his monks.|$|E
50|$|In hot weather, {{people need}} to drink plenty of <b>cool</b> <b>liquids</b> to replace fluids lost from sweating. Thirst is not a {{reliable}} sign that a person needs fluids. A better indicator {{is the color of}} urine. A dark yellow color may indicate dehydration.|$|R

50|$|Dhindo is {{eaten by}} making a small ball with one's fingers, dipping it in a <b>cool</b> <b>liquid</b> (lentil soup or milk or gundruk) and swallowed. It is not chewed as Dhindo is made of millet, sticks between teeth, and is hot {{at the time of}} consumption.|$|R
50|$|Normally, {{crystals}} do {{not form}} smooth faces or sharp crystal outlines. Many crystals grow from <b>cooling</b> <b>liquid</b> magma. As magma cools, the crystals grow and eventually touch each other, preventing crystal faces from forming properly or at all.|$|E
50|$|Igneous rocks {{were formed}} from <b>cooling</b> <b>liquid</b> magma, and {{subsequently}} solidified {{on or near}} the atmosphere (volcanic or extrusive). These are found at the mid-western portion of the municipality (Dupinga) {{as well as on the}} south-eastern boundary of San Luis with the municipality of Dingalan. These rocks are composed of basalt, andesite, greywackes and breccia.|$|E
50|$|Liquids {{allow the}} {{transfer}} of more heat from the parts being cooled than air, making liquid cooling suitable for overclocking and high performance computer applications. Compared to air <b>cooling,</b> <b>liquid</b> cooling is also influenced less by the ambient temperature. Liquid cooling's comparatively low noise-level compares favorably to that of active cooling, which can become quite noisy.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that <b>cooling</b> {{materials}} to <b>liquid</b> nitrogen temperature (77 K) is often not practical on a large scale, although many commercial magnets are routinely <b>cooled</b> to <b>liquid</b> helium temperatures (4.2 K).|$|R

50|$|The Earth Rangers Centre {{was one of}} {{the first}} 100% radiant heated and cooled {{buildings}} in North America. The building uses 22 km of REHAU radiant tubing, which was laid within the concrete floors and ceiling. The flow of a non-toxic, vegetable-based liquid (water/glycol) through these tubes causes the concrete to become thermally activated. In the warm seasons, <b>cooled</b> <b>liquid</b> is supplied to the concrete slabs. The heat from the computers, people and the sun is absorbed by the concrete, causing the <b>cooled</b> <b>liquid</b> in the tubing to warm up. The <b>liquid</b> is then <b>cooled</b> by rejecting heat to the ground source system or free cooled by directly coupling to the cooling tower. In the colder months, the glycol is warmed by the ground source heat pump before it is supplied to the slab system.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{manufacturers}} use {{a hybrid}} cooling method where engine oil is circulated between the engine case {{and a small}} radiator. Here the oil doubles as <b>cooling</b> <b>liquid,</b> prompting the name [...] "oil-cooling." [...] Suzuki has produced many oil-cooled motorcycles. Modern BMW R-series flat-twin motorcycles, such as the R1150GS, use air and oil cooling. Polaris's Victory motorcycles use oil/air cooling exclusively.|$|E
50|$|After {{preparing}} {{a large number}} of MEMS devices on a silicon wafer, individual dies have to be separated, which is called die preparation in semiconductor technology. For some applications, the separation is preceded by wafer backgrinding {{in order to reduce the}} wafer thickness. Wafer dicing may then be performed either by sawing using a <b>cooling</b> <b>liquid</b> or a dry laser process called stealth dicing.|$|E
50|$|It is the {{advantage}} of the stealth dicing process that it does not require a <b>cooling</b> <b>liquid.</b> Dry dicing methods inevitably have to be applied for the preparation of certain microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), in particular, when these are intended for bioelectronic applications. In addition, stealth dicing hardly generates debris and allows for improved exploitation of the wafer surface due to smaller kerf loss compared to wafer saw.|$|E
