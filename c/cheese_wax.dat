Flannel was second only to cattle among the principality's exports. In exchange, the principality imported salt, wine, wheat, and other luxuries from London and Paris.

50|$|Originally {{an attempt}} to provide her family with cheese from their surplus milk, Anne's {{experiments}} in cheese making were hampered {{by a lack of}} experience and knowledge. After a number of relatively unsuccessful attempts, an improved cheese was developed that had business potential. Typically considered a trade that must be taught, the Keating's are Ireland's only self-taught cheesemakers. They were also among the early adopters of naturally bandaging (coating with <b>wax)</b> <b>cheese.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Careful {{inquiry and}} reminiscence {{concerning}} {{the substance of}} the moon show that eighteen children of 423, averaging five years, thought it made of cheese. Sometime the mice eat it horseshoe-shaped, or that it could be fed by throwing cheese up so clouds could catch it; or it was green because the man in the moon fed on green grass; its spots were mould; it was really green but looked yellow, because wrapped in yellow cheese cloth; it was <b>cheese</b> mixed with <b>wax</b> or with melted lava, which might be edible; there were many rats, mice and skippers there; it grew big from a starry speck of light by eating cheese.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} notable things about Miss Treason's cottage is that {{everything}} in it is black, from the floor to the rafters. While Tiffany is her apprentice, she has to paint her <b>cheeses</b> with black-colored <b>wax</b> so that they'll {{fit in with the}} theme. Her cottage has all the hallmarks of a 'bad witch' (i.e. skulls, spider webs, etc.,); all these are fake, bought from Boffo's, a joke shop in Ankh-Morpork. Treason also uses the name [...] "Boffo" [...] to describe the unique power that these props give her: She describes [...] "Boffo" [...] as [...] "the power of expectations;" [...] the strength that one gains from behaving exactly as someone expects you to.|$|R
40|$|Summary: Eradication of rodent {{species from}} some {{offshore}} islands {{has proved to}} be an effective means of conserving native animal communities and restoring natural ecological processes on the islands. As methods of eradication differ for different rodent species, a truthful monitoring method to detect species presence and relative density is essential for a successful eradication programme. This study compared two spatial arrangements (line vs. grid), 5 different baits (chocolate, <b>cheese,</b> soap, <b>wax,</b> oiled wood) and 3 cover types (transparent plastic, wire netting, galvanised iron) on the detection of 2 species of rodents on Browns (Motukorea) Island in June and August. The two species of rodents present on the island were Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) and mice (Mus musculus). Trapping using conventional trapping lines and trapping grids was carried out in June and August, respectively. The traps were set for 8 nights for both lines and grids. Trap lines caught 12. 40 rats per 100 corrected trap-nights (100 ctn- 1) and no mice; trap grids caught 5. 3 rats 100 ctn- 1 and 0. 2 mice 100 ctn- 1. Trap grids appeared to be better than trap lines for detecting the presence/absence of rodent species when two species coexist and one appears subordinate to the other. On trap lines the trapping rate of rats was consistently high for five of the first six nights. On trap grids the trapping rate was variable on all nights with the first mice being caught on the third night. Three-night trapping sessions, conventionally used by mos...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{person by}} whom this {{appropriation}} was made was John de Pontissara, alias Points, Bishop of Winchester, {{the founder of}} the college to which the tithes were granted; it was, however, afterwards confirmed by William de Edyngton, by whom the vicar's rights, which before were probably undefined, and perhaps the subject of contention, were ascertained and secured to him by endowment. This instrument is still in being, bearing the date of 1362. It may be seen in Bishop Edyngton's Register, part I, fol. 128, under the following marginal title:- 'Ratificatio et Confirmatio appropriationis Ecclesiae de Hursleghe, et ordinationes Vicarie ejusd.' The following is a translation of it, so far as the vicar's interests are concerned in it:- 'The said vicar shall have and receive all and all manner of tithes, great and small, with all offerings and other emoluments belonging to the chapel of Otterbourne, situated within the parish of the said church (viz. of Hursley). He shall also have and receive all offerings belonging to the church of Hursley, and all small tithes arising within the parish of the same, viz., the tithes of <b>cheese,</b> milk, honey, <b>wax,</b> pigs, lambs, calves, eggs, chickens, geese, pigeons, flax, apples, pears, and all other tithable fruits whatsoever of curtilages or gardens. He shall also receive the tithes of mills already erected, or that shall be erected. He shall also receive and have all personal tithes of all traders, servants, labourers, and artificers whatsoever, due to the said church. The said Vicar shall also receive and have all mortuaries whatsoever, live and dead, of whatsoever things they may consist. The said Vicar shall also receive and have all profit and advantage arising from the herbage of the churchyard. He shall also have and receive the tithes of all fish-ponds whatsoever, within the said parish, wheresoever made, or that hereafter shall be made. The said Vicar shall also have for his habitation the space {{on the south side of}} the churchyard, measuring in length, from the said churchyard and the rectorial house, formerly belonging to the said church, towards the south, twenty-seven perches; and in breadth, from the hedge and ditch between the said space and the garden of the aforesaid former rectory on the west, towards the east, sixteen perches and a half, with the buildings erected thereon.' ...|$|R
