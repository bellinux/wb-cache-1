30|$|The {{pressure}} of cracking and <b>coking</b> <b>units</b> almost always indicates additional process technologies within the refinery such as alkylation or polymerization units for converting olefin streams to gasoline and petrochemical blendstocks, aromatics, asphalt plants, sulfur recovery, and hydrogen production.|$|R
50|$|As of 2002, {{there were}} 130 {{petroleum}} refineries worldwide producing 172,000 tons per day of petroleum coke. Included in those worldwide data, about 59 <b>coking</b> <b>units</b> were {{operating in the}} United States and producing 114,000 tons per day of coke.|$|R
50|$|The {{capacity}} of the Refinery was augmented in 1995 to 2.35 MMTPA (51,400 BPSD) through expansion of the Refinery consisting of one Crude Distillation Unit (CDU-II) and one Delayed <b>Coking</b> <b>Unit</b> (DCU-II). A LPG bottling plant of capacity 22000 MTPA {{was added to the}} complex and commissioned on March 2003.|$|E
50|$|Delayed coking {{is one of}} {{the unit}} {{processes}} used in many oil refineries. The adjacent photograph depicts a delayed <b>coking</b> <b>unit</b> with 4 drums. However, larger units have tandem pairs of drums, some with as many as 8 drums, each of which may have diameters of up to 10 meters and overall heights of up to 43 meters.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to crude and vacuum distillation units, the major refining units are catalytic reforming unit, once-through Hydrocracker unit, Resid Fluidised Catalytic Cracking unit, visbreaker unit, delayed <b>coking</b> <b>unit,</b> bitumen blowing unit, hydrogen generation unit, sulphur block and associated auxiliary facilities. In {{order to produce}} low sulphur diesel, a Diesel Hydro Desulphurisation Unit (DHDS) was commissioned in 1999.|$|E
30|$|Delayed coking is an {{important}} process used to convert heavy oils to light products. Energy consumption and light oil yield are important factors for evaluating the delayed coking process. This paper analyzes the energy consumption and product yields of delayed <b>coking</b> <b>units</b> in China. The average energy consumption {{shows a decreasing trend}} in recent years. The energy consumption of different refineries varies greatly, with the average value of the highest energy consumption approximately twice that of the lowest energy consumption. The factors affecting both energy consumption and product yields were analyzed, and correlation models of energy consumption and product yields were established using a quadratic polynomial. The model coefficients were calculated through least square regression of collected industrial data of delayed <b>coking</b> <b>units.</b> Both models showed good calculation accuracy. The average absolute error of the energy consumption model was approximately 85 MJ/t, and that of the product yield model ranged from 1 wt% to 2.3 wt%. The model prediction showed that a large annual processing capacity and high load rate will result in a reduction in energy consumption.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} work during this {{reporting}} period was {{the construction of}} an automated probe that will be used to measure the thickness of coke deposits in thermal cracking furnaces. A discovery was made during the last reporting period, which indicated that a conventional NDE broadband transducer could be used in conjunction with a sacrificial standoff composed of a fusible alloy to efficiently couple the transducer to a rough surface operating at high temperature. A probe was constructed that incorporates the recent discovery and initial testing of the probe is now underway. Successful development of the coke detector will provide industry with the only available method for on-line measurement of coke deposits. The coke detector will have numerous uses in the refining and petrochemical sectors including monitoring of visbreakers, hydrotreaters, delayed <b>coking</b> <b>units,</b> vacuum tower heaters, and various other heavy oil heating applications where coke formation is a problem...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{presented}} in this paper to quantitatively define the heat removal of the main fractionator in delayed <b>coking</b> <b>units</b> {{on the basis of a}} fractionating precision diagram (Houghland diagram) and column grand composite curve (CGCC). By referring to the CGCC method, several envelopes are illustrated at draw trays including the top pumparound draw, diesel draw, intermediate pumparound draw and gas oil draw, the energy and material balances are then calculated. Assuming practical near-minimum thermodynamic condition (PNMTC), the minimum liquid reflux flow is zero in the envelope for pumparound trays without product draw and the minimum liquid reflux flow is defined by Houghland diagram for pumparound trays with product draw. The PNMTC-CGCC is constructed by calculating the enthalpy-flow deficit to quantitatively define the heat removal constraints in each envelope. Meanwhile, the corresponding practical heat removal curve is constructed. A case study shows that the high temperature heat removal ratio within the main fractionator increased by 8 %. The proposed method offers heat removal inequality constraints for the model to optimize the heat integration between the main fractionator and the heat exchanger network. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

5000|$|The Digboi Refinery {{was set up}} at Digboi in 1901 by Assam Oil Company Ltd. The Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC) {{took over}} the {{refinery}} and marketing management of Assam Oil Company Ltd. with effect from 1981 and created a separate division. This division has both refinery and marketing operations. The refinery at Digboi had an installed capacity 0.50 MMTPA (million metric tonnes per annum). The refining capacity of the refinery was increased to 0.65 MMTPA by modernization of refinery in July, 1996. A new delayed <b>Coking</b> <b>Unit</b> of 1,70,000 TPA capacity was commissioned in 1999. A new Solvent Dewaxing Unit for maximizing production of microcrystalline wax was installed and commissioned in 2003. The refinery has also installed Hydrotreater-UOP in 2002 {{to improve the quality}} of diesel. The MSQ Upgradation unit has been commissioned. A new terminal with state of the art facility is under construction and expected to be completed by 2016.|$|E
50|$|The whole coal {{production}} and <b>coking</b> works <b>unit</b> lost £7 million in 1981, employing: 142 on development; 131 on the coalface; 197 below the ground; 101 on the surface. In 1982 output declined steeply {{as a major}} coal seam at Windsor became unworkable, while in 1984 an overtime ban led directly to the 1984/5 UK miners strike spreading to South Wales. Although profitable post the strike, both sites of the whole unit closed {{as part of the}} NCB regional review on 6 November, 1986.|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{the project}} is to {{demonstrate}} the performance and practical use of a laser ultrasonic probe for measuring the thickness of coke deposits located within the high temperature tubes of a thermal cracking furnace. This aim will be met by constructing an optical probe that will be tested using simulated coke deposits that are positioned inside of a bench-scale furnace. Successful development of the optical coke detector will provide industry with the only available method for on-line measurement of coke deposits. The optical coke detector will have numerous uses in the refining and petrochemical sectors including monitoring of visbreakers, hydrotreaters, delayed <b>coking</b> <b>units,</b> vacuum tower heaters, and various other heavy oil heating applications where coke formation is a problem. The coke detector will particularly benefit the olefins industry where high temperature thermal crackers are used to produce ethylene, propylene, butylene and other important olefin intermediates. The ethylene industry requires development of an on-line method for gauging the thickness of coke deposits in cracking furnaces because the current lack of detailed knowledge of coke deposition profiles introduces the single greatest uncertainty in the simulation and control of modern cracking furnaces. The laser ultrasonic coke detector will provide operators with valuable new information allowing them to better optimize the decoking turnaround schedule and therefore maximize production capacity...|$|R
30|$|The primary {{fixed assets}} of a {{refinery}} are its process units, and {{the easiest way}} to describe the units is in terms of their production capacity, technology application, and capital expenditures for acquisition and construction. A refinery represents a collection of integrated process units which are characterized by the number, size, and type of process units, and the technologies applied. It is common to classify refineries broadly by {{the presence or absence of}} particular units (e.g., cracking refineries contain cracking <b>units,</b> <b>coking</b> refineries contain cokers). The manner in which the units are integrated and the cost associated with the receipt and dispatch of feedstock and refined product, including storage capacity, are important but are usually considered secondary factors.|$|R
50|$|INA has two fuel refineries, {{located in}} Rijeka (Urinj) and Sisak. The {{refinery}} in Rijeka {{is located on}} shore, allowing access to the port for deep-drawing ships and the pipeline system of JANAF. More than HRK 54 billion is invested in the refinery system development {{in the last few}} years. In Rijeka refinery three facilities within Hydrocracking complex were built - Mild hydrocracking, Hydrogen unit and Desulphurization plant (Claus) as well as numerous supporting facilities and installations. The facilities are in commercial work from May 2011. In February 2014 a contract on basic design for the Delayed <b>Coking</b> <b>Unit</b> for Rijeka Refinery was signed with the company Bechtel Hydrocarbon Technical Solutions (BHTS). In Sisak refinery three plants have been completed: desulphurization plant, the so-called Claus the hydrodesulphurization of FCC gasoline plant and Isomerization plant. Furthermore, from mid-2013 Sisak Refinery has the possibility of production of diesel fuels with bio component and in the same year in September a system of additional wastewater treatment KROFTA was put into operation, while in April 2014 the installation of new coke chambers was carried out at the Coking plant.|$|E

40|$|Changes in oil {{refining}} technology and economics are driving refiners to utilize thermal processes {{to maximize the}} conversion of heavy crude oil components to clean products. Since the primary unit operation to accomplish this objective is the <b>coking</b> <b>unit,</b> more cokers are being built, and existing cokers are being operated to maximum capacity utilization. SRI recently completed an assignment for a refiner interested in converting the by-product fluid coke from his unit to electricity.

30|$|Odour {{problems}} {{arising from}} sewage, furniture, or human and pet’s activities have been continuing {{to grow in}} significance over recent years. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Common and strong odorous compounds often include reduced sulfur compounds which may come from sewage, water, or toilets [7, 8]. In refinery or petrochemical plants, sulfur-containing compounds {{have been identified as}} the predominant odorants {{in a wide range of}} odour emissions in heavy oil <b>coking,</b> sulfur recovery <b>unit,</b> which has caused serious environmental problem [6]. Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is produced as a by-product of fart and also the decomposition of sulfur-containing organic constituents of manure. These sulfur-containing odour materials not only corrode the infrastructure, but also caused ill or sick to the people around. In fact, among the odour substances, H 2 S is often the main and most often seen chemical causing the un-comfortable feeling and needs control first [5, 9, 10, 11]. The other organic sulfur compounds, such as thiophene, carbonyl sulfide, are normally much less than H 2 S, but also possess a much stronger smell [5, 8, 12].|$|R
40|$|In indoor {{environment}} situations severe odour nuisances often limits or prevents use. This often {{is reason to}} check indoor Air PAH-contamination which mainly derive {{from a variety of}} building material containing coal tar constituents. Today the use of tar as an additive to wood-preservatives, solvents and building material is strongly restricted in Germany (GefStoffV) but other sources for similar odours are fire-events, asphalt and bitumen products. Using a modified VDI method 3875 - 1 including an additional sampling on Polyurethane-foam for analysing air-samples, very variable patterns of single PAH concentrations are obtained which correspond to the source-type. While high concentrations with naphthalene are regularly found indoors, not volatile and rather dust-borne PAH like Benzoapyrene (BaP) rarely occur in concentrations about 2 ng/m. Some PAH have a very high carcinogenic potency in human, some smell intensively. However, as the absence of the characteristic smell does not implicate the absence of PAH, it cannot be used for remediation guidelines and health-concerns remain. For remediation official threshold guideline levels and remediation action criteria are needed. In this course a risk-assessment is proposed using PAH toxicity equivalence factors (TEF) against BaP. Multiplication with measured concentrations and summarising leads to the Cancerogenic Equivalence Sum (KEsum) for the 16 measured PAH. Using data on the additional cancer risk through definite BaP-exposition in the PAH mixture of <b>coking</b> plant gas (<b>unit</b> risk) we can postulate a KEsum of 1, 36 for this gas. On a basis of this scaling we can quantify the additional cancer risk for various air samples. Accepted risks of 10 - 4 and 5 · 10 - 4 lead to guideline values for successful remediation of KEsum = 10. 0. Case studies are shown where the scheme could successfully be applied as the main criteria for building remediations...|$|R

The work was motivated by the need to control the quantities for pollutants emitted by the process. A model containing 184 kinetic equations was developed for the combustion system, which led to a 36 x 36 stiff matrix of non linear differential equations. The model allows the determination of a) the concentration of generated pollutants, b) the conditions for initiation and termination of each product formation, c) the effects of temperature variation, d) the effects of air/fuel ratio, and e) the effects of secondary air injection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Syrian {{petroleum}} coke, {{produced by}} a delayed <b>coking</b> <b>unit,</b> {{is characterized by a}} high percentage of fines which tends to reduce its commercial value. Blending coke fines using appropriate binders, such as bitumen and polyacrylic acid, can lead, however, to an improved coke that is similar in structure, appearance and other properties to better-quality coke lumps. In this work, samples of Syrian coke fines were blended with Polyacrylic acid or bitumen and thermally treated at high temperatures and increased residence time in an inert atmosphere of nitrogen at atmospheric pressure. This treatment led to a general improvement of the petcoke qualities. The rate of desulphurization obtained {{as a result of the}} thermal treatment was 88 % for most coke fines. A small overall reduction in the calorific value of the treated coke was also observed, but this was less than 8 % in general...|$|E
40|$|Petroleum {{refineries}} {{have faced}} many challenges {{to remain competitive}} in the world fuels market. If, on the one hand, recovered crude oils are getting heavier {{and there is a}} decreasing demand for heating and residual fuels, on the other hand, the demand for transportation fuels and more value-added products is increasing, renewing the interest of the refineries on the bottom-of-the-barrel residue upgrading. However, the feedstock for heavy oil conversion units comprises large, multifunctional molecules. Thus, characterize it adequately is a complex task, making complicated the obtaining of accurate kinetic models. This paper proposes a proper approach to simulation, optimization and control of a delayed <b>coking</b> <b>unit</b> by using Aspen Plus software. A novel procedure to represent a given feed material by pseudocomponents is described and a stoichiometric model based on known fractional conversions was developed. PID control was implemented in the system and satisfactory results were achieved. This supposes that the proposed methodology can be useful to obtain more appropriate predictions of behaviour and yield for processes with difficult dynamics and it can be applied in several ways, as on the tracking of processes as well as on new optimization techniques and advanced control...|$|E
40|$|Heat {{exchanger}} {{networks in}} process plants recover usable heat from hot to cold process streams such as feedstock, product, and pumparound streams. In this paper, {{we focus on}} the design of a heat exchanger network for removing variable heat from a complex fractionator in delayed coking units. A superstructure-based mixed integer nonlinear programming model is presented to minimize the total annual cost, including the heat exchanger area cost and the utility cost. In the proposed model, duties and operating parameters of pumparounds are optimized and the optimized structure of the heat exchanger network is defined simultaneously. Meanwhile, two modifications are applied to improve the simultaneous optimization model for the integrated system of the complex fractionator and heat exchanger network. First, a predominant calculation method for the log mean temperature difference is introduced in order to obtain the results closest to the actual process; second, nonconstant specific heat of process streams with pseudocomponents is considered to represent real thermal properties of process streams in the process model. A case study is carried out to demonstrate simultaneous optimization of the fractionator and heat exchanger network. The optimal design for the model is compared to the one with conventional design heuristics. By applying the proposed model to integrate the operation of the fractionator and heat exchanger network in a delayed <b>coking</b> <b>unit,</b> the total annual cost is reduced by 2. 1 million CNY considering the constraints of the heat removals...|$|E
40|$|Delayed coking evolved {{steadily}} {{over the}} early to mid 1900 s to enable refiners to convert high boiling, residual petroleum fractions to light products such as gasoline. Pound for pound, coking is the most energy intensive of any operation in a modern refinery. Large amounts of energy are required to heat the thick, poor-quality petroleum residuum to the 900 to 950 degrees F required to crack the heavy hydrocarbon molecules into lighter, more valuable products. One common misconception of delayed coking is that the product coke is a disadvantage. Although coke is a low valued (near zero economic value) byproduct, compared to transportation fuels, {{there is a significant}} worldwide trade and demand for coke as it is an economical fuel. Coke production has increased steadily over the last ten years, with further increases forecast for the foreseeable future. Current domestic production is near 111, 000 tons per day. A major driving force behind this increase is the steady decline in crude quality available to refiners. Crude slates are expected to grow heavier with higher sulfur contents while environmental restrictions are expected to significantly reduce the demand for high-sulfur residual fuel oil. Light sweet crudes will continue to be available and in even greater demand than they are today. Refiners will be faced with the choice of purchasing light sweet crudes at a premium price, or adding bottom of the barrel upgrading capability, through additional new investments, to reduce the production of high-sulfur residual fuel oil and increase the production of low-sulfur distillate fuels. A second disadvantage is that liquid products from cokers frequently are unstable, i. e., they rapidly form gum and sediments. Because of intermediate investment and operating costs, delayed coking has increased in popularity among refiners worldwide. Based on the 2000 Worldwide Refining Survey published in the Oil and Gas, the delayed coking capacity for 101 refineries around the world is 2, 937, 439 barrels/calendar day. These cokers produce 154, 607 tons of coke per day and delayed coking accounts for 88 % of the world capacity. The delayed coking charge capacity in the United States is 1, 787, 860 b/cd. Despite its wide commercial use, only relatively few contractors and refiners are truly knowledgeable in delayed-coking design, so that this process carries with it a ''black art'' connotation. Until recently, the expected yield from cokers was determined by a simple laboratory test on the feedstock. As a result of Tulsa University's prior related research, a process model was developed that with additional work could be used to optimize existing delayed cokers over a wide range of potential feedstocks and operating conditions. The objectives of this research program are to: utilize the current micro, batch and pilot unit facilities at The University of Tulsa to enhance the understanding of the coking process; conduct additional micro and pilot unit tests with new and in-house resids and recycles to make current optimization models more robust; conduct focused kinetic experiments to enhance the furnace tube model and to enhance liquid production while minimizing sulfur in the products; conduct detailed foaming studies to optimize the process and minimize process upsets; quantify the parameters that affect coke morphology; and to utilize the knowledge gained from the experimental and modeling studies to enhance the computer programs developed in the previous JIP for optimization of the coking process. These refined computer models will then be tested against refinery data provided by the member companies. Novel concepts will also be explored for hydrogen sulfide removal of furnace gases as well as gas injection studies to reduce over-cracking. The following deliverables are scheduled from the two projects of the three-year JIP: (1) A novel method for enhancing liquid yields from delayed cokers and data that provide insight as to the optimum temperature to remove hydrogen sulfide from furnace gases. (2) An understanding of what causes foaming in coker drums and ways to minimize sulfur in the produced liquids. (3) An understanding of the HES impacts resulting from hot spots, poor drainage, and settling. (4) A screening model to quantify how other feedstocks and/or a combination of feedstocks will behave in a refinery, and kinetic/optimization models that can represent virtually any delayed <b>coking</b> <b>unit</b> across a wide range of process conditions and feedstocks. Primarily graduate students, post-Doctoral Research Associates and faculty members, will conduct the research in this project...|$|E
