50|$|Critics of the Act {{point out}} that while divorce is within the purview of {{personal}} laws, maintenance is not, and thus it is discriminatory to exclude Muslim women from a <b>civil</b> law. <b>Exclusion</b> of non-Muslim men from a law that appears inherently beneficial to men is also pointed out by them. Hindu nationalists have repeatedly contended that a separate Muslim code is tantamount to preferential treatment and demanded a uniform civil code.|$|R
5000|$|The company {{survived the}} First World War and the Great Depression, {{but by the}} end of the Second World War it was firmly on the {{critical}} list. The company was not one of the automakers included in the Pons Plan. [...] The Pons Plan reflected government determination to structure the French auto-industry according to priorities determined by politicians and <b>civil</b> servants: <b>exclusion</b> from it created great difficulties in obtaining necessary permissions and materials.|$|R
5000|$|After the war Hotchkiss {{was not one}} of the {{automakers}} most favoured by the Pons Plan. The Pons Plan reflected government determination to structure the French auto-industry according to priorities identified by politicians and <b>civil</b> servants: <b>exclusion</b> or any departure from it created great difficulties in obtaining necessary permissions and materials. Government strategy did not wholly exclude Hotchkiss from auto-making, but it did pigeon hole the company’s auto-making activities: these were to be restricted to those of a niche (probably luxury car) manufacturer focused on export sales. [...] The Amilcar Compound did not fit into that definition, and plans to relaunch the car after the war therefore could not be implemented.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1946 {{the company}} {{exhibited}} the prototype “Rosengart Super 5” at the Paris Motor Show at the instigation of Lucien Rosengart himself. [...] However, {{support for the}} Super 5 from the Societé Industrielle de l'Ouest Parisien (SIOP) itself (which had held the controlling interest in the business since 1936) was less than whole hearted.

After the war the company {{was not one of}} the automakers included in the Pons Plan. [...] The Pons Plan reflected government determination to structure the French auto-industry according to priorities identified by politicians and <b>civil</b> servants: <b>exclusion</b> from it created great difficulties in obtaining necessary permissions and materials. Nevertheless, Mathis tried to find new projects: these included the [...] "flattened egg-shaped" [...] 700 cc three-wheeler (Mathis VL333) first exhibited in 1945. When this failed to find favour with the authorities he switched tack, producing a front-wheel drive prototype with a flat-six (2.8 L) engine, and an eyecatching [...] "panoramic" [...] style windscreen. These post-war projects failed, and the factory was only kept going by making engines for light aircraft and components for Renault. The Mathis company closed in 1950.|$|R

Broadly speaking, this Whig theory described two sorts of threats to political freedom: a general moral decay which would invite the intrusion of evil and despotic rulers, and the encroachment of executive authority upon the legislature, the attempt that power always made to subdue the liberty protected by mixed government." [...] This political theory was mainly based on the writings of John Milton, John Locke, James Harrington, and Algernon Sydney.|$|R
40|$|Book synopsis: During {{the seventeenth}} century, in {{response}} to political and social upheavals such as the English <b>Civil</b> Wars, the <b>Exclusion</b> Crisis, and the Popish Plot, women produced {{a wide variety of}} writings in both manuscript and print. This volume represents recent scholarship that has uncovered new texts as well as introducing new paradigms to further our understanding of women's literary history during this tumultuous period. Topics include the category of the 'woman writer' and networks among writers; the interplay between pamphlet and literary culture; the prominence of religious discourse in women's writing; new perspectives on established genres such as poetry, drama and fiction; the recovery of until recently neglected sites of writing, such as manuscripts and funeral monuments; a reassessment of the value and import of the genre of letters; and new approaches to texts both now canonical and newly discovered through the lenses of sexuality, science and race studies, postcolonialism, orientalism, political thought, and military studies...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} authors and {{commentators}} on the Greek crisis {{have pointed out}} that the Greek financial predicament is a byproduct of a deep and chronic political crisis. I propose that we view this political crisis as a crisis of the Social Contract, which generated multiple spheres of economic, <b>civil</b> and civic <b>exclusion,</b> engendering specific public concerns with sovereignty, democracy and asymmetrical relations of power (cf. Thodossopoulos 2014; Kirtsoglou and Theodossopoulos 2010). An anthropological approach to the analysis of crisis and democracy in Greece allows us to document local patterns of accountability, historical and political causality and to analyze them in context. The power of indigenous etiology – how people make sense of political affairs – provides us with unique insights into their preferred avenues of claiming and exercising political agency and participation. The qualitative characteristics of Greek politics and governance – especially after 1974 – have been discussed in the literature under the inclusive terms ‘clientelism’, ‘populism’, ‘corruption’, ‘statism’, and they have been deemed responsible for the inefficiency of the Greek state, the lack of competitiveness of the country as a whole, and ultimately for the lack of fiscal discipline that led to the present financial meltdown...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies {{causes of}} civil war from a game theoretic perspective. It aims to understand not only how authoritarian leaders can strategically mitigate prospects for civil war, but also why authoritarian rulers may pursue activities that increase conflict propensity—despite the large adverse welfare consequences {{of civil war}}s. Each essay focuses primarily on one particular authoritarian survival strategy: building military capacity, extracting resources from society, and excluding threatening ethnic groups from power at the center. The dissertation applies these strategic considerations to engage two major debates in comparative politics: how each of oil wealth and inter-ethnic relationships affect prospects for fighting. The first essay argues that although oil wealth exerts certain effects that increase incentives for rebel groups to fight to control the capital, oil wealth also increases government revenues and exerts an overall effect of decreasing center-seeking civil war propensity. The second essay focuses on a different aspect of oil production, showing how local oil wealth facilitates government territorial encroachment and increases incentives to fight a separatist civil war for oil-rich ethnic minority groups. The third essay extends the focus on inter-ethnic bargaining by showing ethnic groups organized as pre-colonial kingdoms in Sub-Saharan Africa undermined inter-ethnic institution building and increased incentives for ethnopolitical <b>exclusion,</b> <b>civil</b> wars, and military coups after independence...|$|R
40|$|Military {{service has}} long been {{identified}} {{as one of the}} prime signifiers of membership in the Israeli collective, and as such plays a central role in practices of <b>civil</b> inclusion and <b>exclusion.</b> Against the background of perceived changes in the Israel Defense Forces 2 ̆ 7 status in Israeli society in recent years, this study examines the ways in which Israeli citizens from all sectors of society negotiate the meanings of military and national-civil service in Israel discursively and dialogically. The study is based upon a critical discourse analysis of 20 focus group discussions conducted in 2009 - 2010, {{as well as on the}} analysis of additional strategically selected texts that have achieved wide public circulation. The meanings of military service are examined as related to four interimplicated themes that emerged in discourse: perceptions of military service as an indicator of social normativeness, constructions of the relationship between service and psychological normalcy, ideas linking service to contribution to the collective community, and the ways in which service is associated with the civil, political, and social rights of citizenship. The role of discourse is discussed as simultaneously revealing dominant social meanings and the ways in which they are produced, sustained, and contested; constructing social identities and frameworks of cultural knowledge; and concealing underlying mythical structures that remain largely unaddressed as people focus more on the everyday experiences associated with the military 2 ̆ 7 s construction as a civilianized institution than on the military 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in the exercise of violence and the role that this violence plays in solidifying society. Despite much public discussion regarding the decline of the military 2 ̆ 7 s status in society, service continues to function as the archetypical symbol of civic participation and as the temporal, spatial, and institutional template for individuals 2 ̆ 7 and groups 2 ̆ 7 willing sacrifice. Military service is associated with the right to represent the community and its dominant values, and as such becomes imprinted on one 2 ̆ 7 s body and bestows social and cultural credibility. In this way, service both structures and stifles the civil imagination, often leading to conceptual idleness with regard to the possibilities of democratic engagement. ...|$|R
