500|$|On June 25, 1988, the Hanford {{site was}} divided into four areas and {{proposed}} for inclusion on the National Priorities List. On May 15, 1989, the Washington Department of Ecology, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Energy entered into the Tri-Party Agreement, which provides a legal framework for environmental remediation at Hanford. [...] the agencies are engaged in the world's largest environmental cleanup, with many challenges to be resolved {{in the face of}} overlapping technical, political, regulatory, and cultural interests. The cleanup effort is focused on three outcomes: restoring the Columbia River corridor for other uses, converting the central plateau to long-term waste treatment and storage, and preparing for the future. The cleanup effort is managed by the Department of Energy under the oversight of the two regulatory agencies. A citizen-led Hanford Advisory Board provides recommendations from community stakeholders, including local and state governments, regional environmental organizations, business interests, and Native American tribes. Citing the 2014 Hanford Lifecycle Scope Schedule and <b>Cost</b> <b>report,</b> the 2014 estimated cost of the remaining Hanford clean up is $113.6billion – more than $3billion per year for the next six years, with a lower cost projection of approximately $2billion per year until 2046. About 11,000workers are on site to consolidate, clean up, and mitigate waste, contaminated buildings, and contaminated soil. Originally scheduled to be complete within thirty years, the cleanup was less than half finished by 2008. Of the four areas that were formally listed as Superfund sites on October 4, 1989, only one has been removed from the list following cleanup.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis examines <b>cost</b> <b>reporting</b> at a Navy Branch Medical Clinic. <b>Costs</b> are traditionally <b>reported</b> under a partial <b>cost</b> <b>reporting</b> system. By applying {{basic principles of}} managerial accounting, a proposed full <b>cost</b> <b>reporting</b> system is created. Under the traditional system, one figure representing total consumption for each quarter is reported for each workcenter.

Teams may also use the overview to explain items or processes that might appear to be discrepancies within the report.""The core of the report is the series of costing sheets.

[...] The Cost Documentation [...] "includes copies of receipts, invoices, price tags, catalog pages, online prices, or other documentation, tosubstantiate {{the costs of the}} parts and materials of any item costing more than $30.

40|$|Our model {{explores the}} co-existence of both {{cooperative}} and competitive behaviors in an alliance setting. Specifically, when alliance partners cooperatively choose observable contributions given <b>reported</b> <b>costs,</b> their self-interested behavior {{may lead to}} misreporting of costs related to these contributions. We show that truthful <b>cost</b> <b>reporting</b> by an alliance firm is valuable, thereby establishing that accurate <b>cost</b> <b>reports</b> are a determinant of successful alliance performance. Next we show that an alliance firm's <b>cost</b> <b>reporting</b> behavior may depend {{on the type of}} payoffs it receives from alliance, i. e., a share of profit or revenue, and also on the type of relationship between contributions, i. e., whether they are technical substitutes or complements. While we have focussed on highlighting factors which underlie cost misreporting, this study also may serve as a basis for investigating ways to design contracts to diminish the loss an alliance suffers from cost misreporting of the firms, thus increasing the chance that an alliance will be successful.

40|$|Most {{studies on}} cost-based {{decision-making}} examine the profit impact of <b>cost</b> <b>reports</b> {{that rely on}} different methods to allocate costs. In practice, firms' <b>cost</b> <b>reports</b> often employ the same cost allocation method with subtle variations {{in the way that}} the cost data are presented. This paper examines experimentally the profit impact of a <b>cost</b> <b>report's</b> presentation format in relation to a decision maker's level of cost accounting knowledge. Using a customer profitability report prepared using activity-based costing and presented in either a tabular or a graphical format, participants analyze a complex pricing and resource allocation task that affects firm profitability. The results suggest a strong relation between presentation format and cost accounting knowledge. Specifically, decision makers with a low level of cost accounting knowledge attain higher profits when they use a graphical format in comparison to a tabular format. More surprisingly, graphs (versus tables) have an adverse effect on profits for users with a high level of cost knowledge. This result has broad implications: in order to facilitate the decisions of a variety of users of accounting data (e. g. managers, external investors, etc.), firms may need to adapt the presentation format of their accounting data to the level of accounting sophistication of the users. ...|$|R
