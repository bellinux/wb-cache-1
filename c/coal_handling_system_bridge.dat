The normal coal samples {{were exposed to the}} weathering condition for l-rnonth, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and one year. These weathered coal samples were tested with the drop breakage apparatus and compared with the drop test results of normal unweathered coal. The effect of different types of surface onto which the coal was dropped was determined by dropping onto a steel plate, conveyor belt and coal stockpile. A degradation model was developed with several parameters to measure the total fines generation of <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> <b>systems</b> of the Gladstone port. The rate of fines generation of coal increases with the period of weathering. The fines generation increases up to 9 months of weathering.

40|$|Abstract]: Millmerran Power Station (MPS) {{consists}} of two units with each unit producing 420 MW of electricity. The coal is delivered to the plant by off road type trucks and unloaded into a 500 MT hopper. The ROM (run of mine) coal is processed {{through a series of}} crushing stations and <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> (storage/reclaim) <b>systems,</b> and delivered by overland conveyor to the power plant silos. MPS, as a coal fired station, is wholly dependent on a consistent and reliable supply of coal to maintain operating efficiency. MPS has been experiencing inefficiencies in their ROM coal supply because of constant blockage issues at the receiving hopper. This blockage {{is a direct result of}} large lumps of coal coming from the mine. The blockages interrupt the supply of coal potentially lowering the fuel supply to the power station. Currently, an excavator is hired to clear up the blockage which could be utilised more effectively elsewhere. This introduces an extra cost to the mine in terms of both money and inefficiency. MPS is seeking an engineering design solution to this problem. The elimination of the blockages through an automatic system without increasing any safety risks is highly desirable as that would result in a cheaper and smoother operation of the mine. A literature review on the current <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> of MPS was essential in order to be able to develop a design that is suitable for MPS. In this investigation, five conceptual designs with the most appropriate design, in terms of meeting the specified criteria, was analysed and detailed. It was found that the simpler and more effective the design, the higher its practicality in terms of reaching the desired objectives. This enabled an overall cost estimate budget to be produced, which would be the major deciding factor on the implementation of the design. The results of this investigation will aid in gaining an understanding of the overall general solution for the ROM coal blockage problem at MPS. Both design and engineering solutions have been recommended in this dissertation. This will lead eventually to a more automated, safer, efficient and cost effective operating environment...|$|R

In the thermal power plants maximum requirements of fuel is a <b>coal.</b> The <b>handling</b> of this fuel is a great job. To handle the fuel, i. e., coal, each power station is equipped with a <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> plant. Maintenance of Critical Equipments for <b>Coal</b> <b>Handling</b> Plants (CHP) of Thermal Power Stations is typical job. The failures of these equipments have led to high maintenance and operation costs. The reason for inspection depends on the component and its effect on plant operation. But one of the main systems of thermal power plant is coal-handling system. No such efforts are carried out to assess the life of <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> plant component. To maintain an efficiently operating unit and avoid failure of critical equipment, it is necessary to maintain the critical parts of that equipment. There are varieties of critical equipments components in <b>Coal</b> <b>Handling</b> Plants.

40|$|The <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> process {{involves}} {{a number of}} activities from loading and unloading to stockpile. This procedure {{can be carried out}} by coal conveying system which includes a large number of mechanical equipment. The important activities under <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> include loading/unloading, dumping, transporting etc. which are done with the help of various mechanical equipment. Every organization wants to profit as much as possible and increases their production rate by using maximum effort for care and maintain. And it is possible if the equipment is running in good condition with zero breakdowns, zero accident, and zero wastage. This research work presents a practical analysis for monitoring the operational performance of equipment, which shows the two additional objectives: the first one is the identification of major causes of production losses which are born from malfunctions, breakdowns, and bad operating programme. And the second one is the implementation of a suitable and appropriate methodology for improvement of <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> <b>systems,</b> which <b>handling</b> the <b>coal</b> from bunker to stockyard within an industry. The data are analyzed and compared with World class to Obtained OEE. During the operation, many reasons are there, which affect the production rate called six big losses. To minimize the six big losses and improve productivity, an accurate effective estimation of equipment is necessary and offers a suitable methodology. For the purpose of the study, a case study methodology is applied in order to analyze in the depth of maintenance in a real context. The primary focus of this research work is to monitor the equipment performance in <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> plants and its contribution to the company for overall operation. The OEE data are recorded through tables and compared to world class OEE considering the operational losses and also performance reports are briefly analyzed through figures in terms of equipment failures in different locations, idle time for materials, operators and speed loss time for minor stoppages like sensor blocked, cleaning/checking or component jamming. For minimizing the downtime and promote productivity, a suitable methodology is developed through tables for determining the status of <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> equipment viz. Tippler, Side arm charger, Reversible apron feeder, Belt conveyor system, Stacker, Reclaimer. This research work deals with the quantitative measurement of equipment performance in <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> plant, which defines losses for many reasons. As a result, valuable information is provided concerning the performance monitoring of production equipment and implementing a suitable methodology for improvement of <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> machinery operations viz tippler, side arm charger, reversible apron feeder, belt conveyor, stacker, reclaimer. Introduce the estimation and evaluation of OEE procedure which is highly valid and accurate performance indicator and has become very popular in all the industries starting from mining area for excavation of material to harbour area for material handling. OEE shows a right metrics to analyze the ordinary issue and improving the whole process. There are many formulas, systems and metrics being used to improve the whole production process, but one and only OEE reduces complex problem into easy. The biggest advantage of OEE allows companies to have separate business functions by applying a single easy to understand the formula.

40|$|The {{transport}} {{processes in}} chromium oxide reviewed here, {{are related to}} the basic ionic processes in oxide. Solid state science has been effective in describing the complicated diffusion-controlled oxide growth of chromium and chromia-forming alloys. Additions of reactive elements to chromia-forming alloys have a remarkably beneficial effect and this effect is also related to ionic transport processes in crystal lattices. Chromia-forming alloys are widely used in <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> and conversion <b>systems</b> due to their good high-temperature corrosion properties; for industrial applications the requirement is that a good adherent protective oxide with a low diffusion of defects is formed. Recently, improved knowledge has been gained of the identity of the moving species and the values of the corresponding diffusion coefficients in chromia scales. STEM measurements give experimental support for the theory of grain-boundary segregation and blocking of grain-boundary diffusion by reactive elements. The current ideas on the transport in chromia and the role of rare earth additions on the corrosion behavior are reviewed. In addition calculations on crystal lattices and grain boundaries are discussed. The calculation on chromia have been beneficially influenced by earlier theoretical considerations on nickel oxide.
