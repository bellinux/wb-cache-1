An open-ended question asks the respondent to formulate his own answer, whereas a <b>closed-ended</b> <b>question</b> has the respondent pick an answer from a given number of options. The response options for a <b>closed-ended</b> <b>question</b> should be exhaustive and mutually exclusive. Four types of response scales for closed-ended questions are distinguished: ...|$|E
5000|$|A <b>closed-ended</b> <b>question</b> (e.g. [...] "Nice weather today, isn't it?") is {{regarded}} as potentially less effective {{because it can be}} answered with a simple [...] "Mm-hmm," [...] which is essentially a conversational dead end, requiring the initiater of the conversation to start from scratch.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Closed-ended</b> <b>questions</b> {{dominate}} most interview schedules. Yet {{the almost}} exclusive {{use of this}} form did not arise because open-ended questions, its major competitor, proved to be weak indicators of public opinion. Instead, responses from open-ended questions proved more difficult and expensive to code and analyze than those from <b>closed-ended</b> <b>questions.</b> Al-though such practical concerns are important, the real task of survey researchers is to measure public opinion accurately. Us-ing an experimental design, this article tests whether open-ended questions measure the important concerns of respondents—one of the long-claimed advantages of this format. The results, on balance, show that open-ended comments reflect such concerns, suggesting that pollsters may want to include more of these ques-tions in their surveys of public opinion. In {{the early days of}} survey research, controversy swirled around whether pollsters should use <b>closed-ended</b> or open-ended <b>questions</b> (Lazarsfeld 1944). That debate has long been settled with <b>closed-ended</b> <b>questions</b> emerging as the overwhelming choice of survey researchers. A major reason for this decision was that fixed-format questions were easier to ask, code, and analyze than their free-format counterparts (Schuman and Presser 1981). Such pragmatic concerns are important, but the crucial issue should be whether open-ended questions provide important insights about public opinion. Yet the preference for <b>closed-ended</b> <b>questions</b> did not arise because of any systematic data that cast doubt on the ability of the open-ended questions to measure the atti-tudes of the public accurately. This article does not seek to resurrect the debate between the open and the closed form, since the latter {{is an integral part of}} our efforts to track public opinion. Instead, it hope...|$|R

40|$|What {{substantive}} criteria do Queensland judicial officers prefer for competence {{tests for}} non-accused child witnesses in criminal proceedings? Are competence tests for sworn and unsworn evidence distinguishable? This paper {{is the second}} reporting a suite of questions concerning competence, {{in a survey of}} Queensland judicial officers. This suite focussed on three general questions of interest: the referability of competence tests to the Queensland legislation; the substantive criteria of competence tests for sworn and unsworn evidence; and the formal framing of competence tests. Two question-types were included - judicial officers signalled, in <b>closed-ended</b> <b>questions,</b> the importance that listed criteria 'should' bear to competence tests, and, in open-ended questions, the questions they 'would' put in competence tests. Question-type seemingly affected some judicial responses. For sworn evidence, a child's understanding of an oath was assigned low importance in <b>closed-ended</b> <b>questions</b> (in two formulations), but high importance in open-ended questions.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{contingent valuation}} (CV) estimates of benefits {{provided by a}} proposed 'Kalkalpen' National Park in Austria. Although descriptive results of welfare measures are presented, {{the focus of the}} paper is on methodological questions concerning the analysis of CV answers. Evidence is given regarding the difference between payment card (PC) answers and <b>closed-ended</b> <b>question</b> formats. Based on different estimation models for CV questions substantial differences are found between closed-ended and payment card welfare measures. On average PC-willingness to pay (WTP) measures are below the closed-ended figures. Since the evaluation models are based on different premises in the calculation of WTP figures a more precise disclosure of the underlying evaluation methods is required if different question formats are compared to one another. Identical assumptions on the probability distributions have to be assumed whenever open- and closed-ended CV welfare measures are compared. Taking theoretical arguments into account the application of the closedended double-bounded Spike model that provides an average welfare measure is recommended. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{health risk}} of smoking is valued using the {{contingent}} valuation method, {{applied to a}} Swedish sample of smokers. The {{respondents were asked to}} put a value on newly developed cigarettes with no associated health risks. The average additional willingness to pay for the new cigarettes is estimated to be between 10 and 41 SEK per pack, where the variation is due to statistical method, discounting, and whether the open-ended or <b>closed-ended</b> <b>question</b> format is used. Using medical data on life shortening effects of smoking, the results indicate rather low values put on a lost life-year, compared to most existing estimates based on other methods. This may indicate that smokers do underestimate the health risk of smoking. There is also initial optimism-bias regarding people's own ability to quit smoking at will. However, there are remaining methodological questions and we found little or no sensitivity to scope. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|E
40|$|The use of "highly elaborative" reminiscing by mothers, {{involving}} {{open-ended questions}} and more detail about past events {{has been shown}} to produce children with greater accuracy and detail in their autobiographical memory recall of past events. This paradigm has not been extended to semantic learning, or to an adult population before. Thus, the present study used a virtual reminiscing agent to investigate the effect of elaborative and non-elaborative reminiscing on students' semantic memory recall of a virtual event to investigate this reminiscing paradigm. A study involving ninety-eight undergraduate psychology students revealed that participants exposed to highly elaborative reminiscing free recalled significantly more correct information than low elaborative reminiscing (<b>closed-ended</b> <b>questions</b> and low detail), and no reminiscing. Second, open-ended questions were superior to <b>closed-ended</b> <b>questions</b> in free recall memory, as well as in number of memory errors. Lastly, the provision of high detail improved recall when combined with open-ended questions, but not when combined with <b>closed-ended</b> <b>questions.</b> These results indicate that an intelligent virtual agent with a highly elaborative reminiscing style may be a valuable learning companion by aiding (adult) students to reflect on and better remember episodic experiences provided in a virtual world. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Institutional Repositories play a {{critical}} role in the research lifecycle. Funding agencies are increasingly seeking an improved return on their investment in research. Repositories facilitate this process by providing storage of, and access to, institutional research outputs and more recently, research data. While repositories are generally managed within the academic library, repository staff require different skills and knowledge compared with traditional library roles. This study reports on a survey of Australasian institutional repository staff to identify skills and knowledge sets. METHODS Institutional repository staff working at universities in Australia and New Zealand were invited to participate in an online survey which incorporated both open and <b>closed-ended</b> <b>question</b> types. RESULTS The survey found significant gaps in the provision of training and in formal coursework that echoed findings in the UK, Italy and the US. DISCUSSION There is clearly a need for more and varied training courses for repository professionals. Repository work requires a specific set of skills that can be difficult to find and institutions will benefit from investing in training and ongoing development opportunities for repository staff. CONCLUSION The survey data could be used to facilitate staff recruitment, development, training, and retention strategies. Information Services, Information ServicesFull Tex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{number of}} family forest {{owners in the}} USA has {{increased}} contin-uously in recent decades, {{and the fate of}} much of US forests lies in the hands of this diverse and dynamic group of people. The National Woodland Owner Survey (NWOS) is a recurring and comprehensive national survey of US private forest owners, including family forest owners. The NWOS includes an open-ended question that explores forest owners ’ motivations and values related to their woodland. The open-ended question format allows respondents to express their own frame of reference in their own words, rather than respond to predetermined, fixed-response categories of motivations. This paper describes the system of values and motivations that emerged from analysis of responses to the open-ended question, and compares these findings to a closed-ended, fixed-response question also included in the NWOS. Diverse and multidimensional motives were expressed by respondents. Eight broad categories and 37 sub-categories of motives and values emerged from analysis of the open-ended question. The fixed categories of the <b>closed-ended</b> <b>question</b> failed to capture many dimensions of forest owner motiva-tions. A more detailed, qualitative understanding of forest owner motivations and values is needed to provide extension foresters and others who work with famil...|$|E

40|$|Nonresponse, both {{unit and}} item, is a {{pressing}} issue in survey methodology; {{it has a}} great impact on making inference to the target population and on survey costs. This paper focuses on item nonresponse to income questions, because income data, collected in almost every survey, has been associated with a large amount of missing data. We will examine changes in nonresponse to the income questions in the Survey of Consumer Attitudes (SCA). SCA is a monthly RDD study; it asks respondents first to report their income in dollar amounts with an open-ended question. For those who do not provide an answer, they are followed up with a <b>closed-ended</b> <b>question</b> with income brackets. We will take a historical approach in studying 20 years of SCA data (from June 1986 to December 2005) and examine the trend of nonresponse to the income questions in SCA over time. Analyses indicate that income item nonresponse has decreased over time, and the decline is related to the unit nonresponse rate, the refusal and refusal conversion rates, and nonresponse to other items in the survey. We interpret these findings through both sample composition and respondent motivation.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} decisions when designing survey questions is whether the questions will be posed as closed-ended or open-ended. Closed-ended questions require respondents to choose from a set of provided response-options, while open-ended questions are answered by respondents in their own words. Open-ended questions offer the benefit of not constraining responses and allowing respondents to freely answer and elaborate upon their responses. Narrative open-ended questions are especially useful when there are no suitable answer categories available for a <b>closed-ended</b> <b>question</b> format, or if providing response options might bias the respondents. Open-ended questions are also powerful tools for collecting more detailed and specific responses from large samples of respondents. However, open-ended questions are burdensome to answer and suffer from higher rates of item-nonresponse. This thesis aims to improve narrative open-ended questions in Web surveys by using visual and adaptive questionnaire design. Previous research on open-ended questions demonstrated that respondents react to the size and design of the answer box offered with an open-ended question in Web surveys. Larger answer boxes seem to pose an additional burden as compared to smaller answer boxes. At the same time larger answer boxes work as a stimulus that increases the length of the response provided by those respondents who actually answer the question. By varying the visual design of answer-boxes this thesis seeks ways to improve narrative open-ended questions...|$|E

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used data from a cross-sectional study involving 2420 disadvantaged subjects aged 18 - 69 years, included consecutively at three Guadeloupian health centers. Hypertension was diagnosed over two consultations {{with a total of}} six blood pressure measurements. Perceived material insecurity was assessed using a <b>closed-ended</b> <b>question.</b> RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension was estimated at 17. 7 % among subjects who believed their material situation would improve in the future, at 28. 2 % among those who believed it would remain the same, and at 43. 3 % among those who believed it would deteriorate. A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension risk more than doubled (OR: 2. 35  - P: 0. 002) among subjects who believed that their material situation would deteriorate in the future compared to those who believed that their situation would improve, with no significant sex-related differences. This relationship was especially strong among subjects aged 40 years or more (OR: 3. 30  - P< 10 (- 3)), and among subjects with low education level (OR: 3. 81  - P: 0. 003), but was independent of the other tested variables.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{described}} racial and socioeconomic disparities {{in the treatment}} of infertility. Patient factors such as attitudes and awareness may be contributing factors. Since primary care is often the setting that serves as an entry into other areas of medicine, we sought to evaluate men's attitudes and awareness of male infertility in the primary care setting. To do this, we performed a cross-sectional survey of men's attitudes toward men's health issues in 210 men from two primary care clinic waiting rooms in Atlanta, Georgia. The survey was self-administered with <b>closed-ended</b> <b>question</b> items and was approximately 20 min in length. Of the 310 men approached, 210 agreed to participate and returned completed surveys. Overall, 52 % of men said they were "very" or "somewhat" familiar with infertility and 25 % were familiar with treatments for infertility. Some men had heard of surgery (21 %) and medication (35 %) as treatments for male infertility. Awareness and familiarity with the condition was greater in high socioeconomic status men (i. e. college graduates or those with income >$ 100 k per year) but did not differ by race on multivariate analysis. Attitudes toward infertility varied by race with non-Caucasian men being more likely to indicate that infertility is a serious condition, to be concerned about infertility, and to believe it decreases a man's quality-of-life. Therefore, a lack of awareness, but not negative attitudes, may contribute to previously-described disparities {{in the treatment of}} infertility...|$|E
