5|$|A {{memorial}} statue {{was erected}} for Whale in 2002 {{on the grounds}} of a new multiplex cinema in his home town of Dudley.

5|$|As part of post-war reclamation, the old pier was demolished. Work {{commenced}} in February 1954 {{on a new}} pier on the new waterfront {{designed in}} a modern utilitarian style. The structure {{was described as a}} U-shaped plan, with an open-sided superstructure. It consisted of tiled reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>base</b> and pillars, and was modelled after previous piers in the area. Its flat roof was also made of concrete, topped with bitumen waterproofing. Five sets of stairs allowed boat passengers to board and disembark, three located on the north side, one on the east and one on the west.|$|E

25|$|During the 2000s, new {{stations}} {{such as the}} Mid Valley station {{appeared in}} more modern designs, consisting primarily of high, curved canopies above the entire platforms. Certain new stations along dual-lane lines are also included with facilities typically reserved for medium-sized stations, such as the Rasa station. The Kuala Lumpur Sentral station, however, is housed under the <b>concrete</b> <b>base</b> of the transport hub, and is stark and utilitarian in design.|$|E
25|$|The {{sculptor}} Fred Parhad (1934–) {{created a}} larger-than-life statue of Ashurbanipal, which {{was placed on}} a street near the San Francisco City Hall main square in 1988. The sculpture shows Asurbanipal wearing a short tunic and holds a lion cub in his proper right arm. The figure stands on a <b>concrete</b> <b>base,</b> with bronze plaque and rosettes. The statue stands across from City Hall next to the Asian Art Museum and faces the San Francisco Library.|$|E
25|$|South of the siding, {{at either}} end of the station, are large stone-pitched open drains. At the west end of the station, uphill of where the siding rejoins the main line, is a water tower, with a sand shed to its west. The two-tier cast iron square water tank stands on timber supports, with its {{disconnected}} jib lying underneath. The skillion- roofed sand shed is clad in corrugated iron, with two doors at the front, and stands on <b>concrete</b> <b>base</b> walls.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} using steelfiber for {{dispersed}} reinforce of fine-grained concrete is {{considered in the}} article. Research of steelfiber <b>concrete</b> patterns <b>based</b> on cement and compositional astringent material was held. The fine-grained cement and the binder with low water demand were used as the main binder. It is established that the application of composite binder and high density packing of the grains raises much the durability indicators. Algorithm and program for composition calculation of fine-grained steel fiber <b>concrete</b> <b>based</b> on technogenic sands enriched with Tavolzhan sands, that allow to get more compact packing of elongated pieces are developed. Optimal selection of filling material allowed to receive fiber <b>concrete</b> <b>based</b> on technogenic sand of Kursk Magnetic Anomaly with ultimate compressive strength equalled to 104, 8 MPa, and with ultimate flexural strength 23, 2 MPa for flexible structures...|$|R

25|$|Later {{applications}} of continuously supported track include Balfour Beatty's 'embedded slab track', {{which uses a}} rounded rectangular rail profile (BB14072) embedded in a slipformed (or pre-cast) <b>concrete</b> <b>base</b> (development 2000s). The 'embedded rail structure', used in the Netherlands since 1976, initially used a conventional UIC54 rail embedded in concrete, and later developed (late 1990s) to use a 'mushroom' shaped SA42 rail profile; a version for light rail using a rail supported in an asphalt concrete–filled steel trough has also been developed (2002).|$|E
25|$|The Span and Boat Shed {{were built}} at {{approximately}} the same time using similar techniques (interlocking steel archways on a <b>concrete</b> <b>base),</b> and are located {{at either end of}} site. The Span is a storage facility for vehicles, equipment and waste. It is called the Span as it was manufactured by the Miracle-Span company which specialises in these buildings. The Boat Shed is used to store, maintain and operate the boats for travel to the local islands and diving (all Ribs of various size). It is situated next to the Biscoe Wharf (named after the RRS John Biscoe). There is a slip (only usable in summer) and a hydraulic crane to lift the boats {{in and out of the}} water.|$|E
25|$|A {{full-length}} portrait {{sculpture of}} Junípero Serra {{is on the}} property of the mission. The cast stone sculpture, by Arthur Putnam, was completed in 1909, cast between 1916–1917 and installed in 1918 when the mission was remodeled. Funding for the piece came from D.J. McQuarry and it cost $500 to cast. It is approximately H. 6ft. 6 in. The sculpture depicts Serra wearing a monk's robe belted at the waist with a knotted rope and a rosary around his neck. He looks down, with his head bowed and eyes downward. The sculpture is on a <b>concrete</b> <b>base.</b> It is {{one of a series of}} allegorical figures commissioned by the estate of E. W. Scripps to depict California history. In 1993 it was examined by the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! program. The program determined that the sculpture was well maintained.|$|E

25|$|The {{sandstone}} memorial {{sits on a}} <b>concrete</b> <b>base</b> step. Above {{this are}} three smooth-faced sandstone steps, {{two of which are}} the same width, separated by a thinner step. On the front face of the two larger steps are leaded marble plaques bearing the names {{of the men and women}} who served in the Second World War. The uppermost step is capped with a cyma recta moulding from which the square pedestal projects. Marble plates are located on the side and front faces of the pedestal and bear an inscription in the form of a verse, the names of the 10 local men who fell and the 39 others who served in the First World War. Semi-circular hood-moulds are located over the top of each plaque. A series of moulded steps sit above this, on which the digger statue stands.|$|E
25|$|Field surveys {{carried out}} in 2003 and 2004 {{reported}} that the bridge {{had little effect on}} the flight paths of the various birdsit was noted that when curlews, dunlins and lapwings approached the bridge, they would change course to gain height and fly over the bridge, but that oystercatchers and turnstones would fly under the bridge. The surveys also showed that the bridge had minimal impact on the roosting habits of most birds, though a flock of mallards were seen to be roosting directly under the bridge, with many positioning themselves on the dry <b>concrete</b> <b>base</b> on one of the pillars. Likewise, it was noted that the bridge had little impact on the birds' feeding habitsturnstones and lapwings were recorded as feeding on mudflats directly under the bridge while the absence of other waders was attributed to the rocky nature of the foreshore.|$|E
25|$|In October, 2013, Husky Energy and Government of Newfoundland & Labrador {{announced}} {{an agreement to}} amend the White Rose Development. White Rose {{is the name of}} an oil field offshore Newfoundland. The announcement included the news that this oil resource could be exploited by installing a gravity based 'wellhead platform' structure over the western section of the oil field on the ocean floor in approximately 120 metres of water. To support this billion dollar wellhead platform construction project, Husky announced that it would be establishing a graving dock facility on the Northside Peninsula at Argentia to support the construction of the <b>concrete</b> <b>base</b> of the wellhead platform. Construction of the graving dock began in late 2013 and was finished in early 2015. However, in December 2014, Husky announced that, due to declining oil prices, the decision to construct the Concrete Gravity Base (CGS) had been deferred.|$|E
