60|$|These barbarous distempers {{had their}} {{origin in the}} tenure of land in Ireland, and in the modes of its occupation. A {{combination}} of causes, political, social, and economical, had {{for more than a}} century unduly stimulated the population of a country which had no considerable resources except in the soil. That soil had become divided into minute allotments, held by a pauper tenantry, at exorbitant rents, of a class of middlemen, themselves necessitous, and who were mere traders in land. A fierce competition raged amid the squalid multitude for these strips of earth which were their sole means of existence. To regulate this fatal rivalry, and restrain this emulation of despair, the peasantry, enrolled in secret societies, found refuge in an inexorable code. He who supplanted another in the occupation of the soil was doomed by an occult tribunal, from which there was no appeal, to a terrible retribution. His house was visited in the night by whitefeet and ribbonmen--his doom was communicated to him, by the post, in letters, signed by Terry Alt, or Molly M'Guire, or he was suddenly shot, like a dog, by the orders of Captain Rock. Yet even these violent inflictions rather punished than prevented the conduct against which they were directed. The Irish peasant had to choose between starving and assassination. If, in deference to an anonymous mandate, he relinquished his holding, he and those who depended on him were outcasts and wanderers; if he retained or accepted it, his life might be the forfeit, but subsistence was secured; and in poor and lawless countries, the means of living are more valued than life. Those who have treated of the agrarian crimes of Ireland have remarked, that the facility with which these outrages have been committed has only been equalled by the difficulty of punishing them. A murder, perpetrated at noonday, in the sight of many persons, cannot be proved in a court of justice. The spectators are never witnesses; and it has been inferred from this, that the outrage is national, and that the heart of the populace is with the criminal. But though a <b>chief</b> <b>landlord,</b> or a stipendiary magistrate, may occasionally be sacrificed, the great majority of victims are furnished by the humblest class. Not sympathy, but terror, seals the lip and clouds the eye of the bystander. And this is proved by the fact that while those who have suffered have almost always publicly declared that they were unable to recognize their assailants, and believed them to be strangers, they have frequently, in confidence, furnished the police with the names of the guilty.|$|E
5000|$|The {{main source}} of income of the {{inhabitants}} of this village is agriculture. People are devoted and loyal. Haji Sai Mohammed and his son Haji Mohammed Khan are the <b>chief</b> <b>landlord</b> of this village and now lands are cultivated under the monitoring of Ch. Kazim Abbas Gondal.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} known {{written record}} of Purton dates from AD 796 when the Saxon King Ecgfrith of Mercia gave 35 hides from Purton to the Benedictine Malmesbury Abbey. The Abbot of Malmesbury {{continued to be}} the <b>chief</b> <b>landlord</b> of Purton throughout Saxon and Norman times, suggesting that an earlier church stood at Purton.|$|E
5000|$|The Baro-Bhuyans (spelled {{variously}} as Baro-Bhuinas, [...] "Baro-Bhuiyan" [...] etc.) were warrior <b>chiefs</b> and <b>landlords</b> (zamindars) on the Indian subcontinent; in {{the region}} of medieval Assam and Bengal, who maintained a loosely independent confederacy. In times of aggression by external powers, they generally cooperated in defending and expelling the aggressor. In times of peace, they maintained their respective sovereignty. In the presence of a strong king, they offered their allegiance. In general, they were in control of a group of villages, called cakala, and the more powerful among them called themselves raja. Baro denotes the number twelve, but in general there were more than twelve <b>chiefs</b> or <b>landlords,</b> and the word baro meant many. Thus, Bhuyan-raj denoted individual Bhuyanship, whereas Baro-Bhuyan denoted temporary confederacies that they formed. In Bengal they carved the land of Bhati into twelve administrative units or Dwadas Bangla ...|$|R
25|$|Community {{forests are}} owned by {{community}} <b>chiefs</b> or <b>landlords</b> who {{have the power to}} grant small-scale logging that are not regulated by the national government. Many of these community owned forests where artisanal logging are located in the northeast part of the DRC. Artisanal logging is profitable but it is also deemed to be illegal. However, corruption in the local government allows the logging to continue.|$|R
6000|$|... "People who are {{ignorant and}} enthusiastic, {{who are in}} {{absolute}} dependence upon their <b>chief</b> or <b>landlord,</b> who are directed in their consciences by Roman Catholic priests, or nonjuring clergymen, and who are not masters of any property, may easily be formed into any mould. They fear no dangers, as {{they have nothing to}} lose, and so can with ease be induced to attempt anything. Nothing can make their condition worse: confusions and troubles do commonly indulge them in such licentiousness, that by these they better it."* ...|$|R
5000|$|Jacob Housman (or Houseman), a wrecker {{who had a}} {{reputation}} of operating in a [...] "high-handed and often illegal manner", was {{at odds with the}} established wreckers in Key West. He moved to Indian Key in 1830, began buying property on the island, and soon became the leader of the community and its <b>chief</b> <b>landlord.</b> He made numerous improvements to the island, spending close to $40,000 on it in four years. His store, the only one on the island, grossed $30,000 a year. As a result of lobbying by Housman, Indian Key acquired an Inspector of Customs in 1832 and a post office in 1834. In 1836, Houseman persuaded the Territorial Legislative Council to split Dade County off from Monroe County, with the upper and middle Keys in the new county and Indian Key as the temporary county seat. Housman also campaigned to have Indian Key made a port of entry, so that salvage from wrecks could be landed there, rather than in Key West, but without success.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Jacobite armies {{were made}} up of Highlanders, serving in clan regiments. They were 70 per cent of the forces in the 1715 {{rebellion}} and over 90 per cent of those in 1745. Most were forced to join by their clan <b>chiefs,</b> <b>landlords</b> or feudal superiors and desertion was a major problem during campaigns. The Jacobites suffered {{from a lack of}} trained officers. A typical clan regiment was {{made up of}} a small minority of gentlemen (tacksmen) who would bear the clan name. The clan gentlemen formed the front ranks of the unit and were more heavily armed than their impoverished tenants who made up the bulk of the regiment. Because they served in the front ranks, the gentlemen suffered higher proportional casualties than the common clansman. The Jacobites often started campaigns poorly armed. In the rising of 1745, at the Battle of Prestonpans, some only had swords, Lochaber axes, pitchforks and scythes, but arms tended to become more conventional as the campaigns progressed. Only officers and gentlemen were equipped with a broadsword, targe and pistol. After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, the Hanoverian commander the Duke of Cumberland reported that there were 2,320 firelocks recovered from the battlefield, but only 190 broadswords.|$|R
50|$|The new KDP of Iraq {{held its}} first {{congress}} in Baghdad on August 16, 1946. The 32 delegates elected a central committee with Hamza Abd Allah as secretary-general, Shaykh Latif and Kaka Ziyad Agha as vice-presidents, and Barzani as president-in-exile. The party demanded autonomy for Iraqi Kurdistan, stating that {{the political and economic}} situation of the Kurds in Iraq was different from that of Iran. The party programme was not specific about any social or economic content for fear of alienating the highly conservative tribal <b>chiefs</b> and <b>landlords</b> who had agreed to support it.|$|R
50|$|After {{break-up}} of the Kamarupa {{kingdom in}} the 12th century, its territories were divided among small kingdoms, local <b>chiefs</b> and <b>landlords.</b> To the very east emerged the Sutia, Ahom and the Kachari kingdoms. To their west was {{the region of}} the Baro-Bhuyans that formed the buffer between the eastern kingdoms and the Kamata kingdom. In 1498, Alauddin Hussain Shah of Gaur attacked Nilambar, the king of Kamata, and occupied it. He left the region in the hands of his son Daniyal, who was attacked and defeated by a conglomeration of Bhuyan landlords led by Harup Narayan. The Bhuyans succeeded in removing the conquerors, but they failed to create a kingdom and instead maintained their fiefdoms.|$|R
5000|$|Chief Justice Roberts {{rejected}} Justice Sonia Sotomayorâ€™s {{contention that}} the raisin reserve requirement is a mere condition on the privilege {{of being in the}} raisin market. Rather, Chief Justice Roberts held that selling produce [...] "is not a special government benefit that the Government may hold hostage." [...] To support this assertion, Chief Justice Roberts cited a footnote in Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., which theorized forfeiting rent payments would not be a mere condition on the privilege of being a <b>landlord.</b> <b>Chief</b> Justice Roberts also refused to apply the Tucker Act because that question was already resolved in Horne I. Finally, Chief Justice Roberts refused to remand the case back to a lower court to decide the amount of compensation to which Horne would be entitled because just compensation for a physical takings is the market value of the property taken, and the Government had already calculated that value when it fined Horne.|$|R
