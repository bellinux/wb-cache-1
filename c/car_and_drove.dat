5|$|In 2003, Slavoj Hašek was awoken by commotion {{from outside}} of his house. Hašek left his house with a shotgun and pursued a thief. After the thief got to his own <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> it in Hašek's direction, he shot and killed him. Hašek was sentenced to five years {{imprisonment}} with the High Court in Olomouc arguing that the defense could not be legitimate, since the shot went through a side window rather than through the front windshield. Hašek was pardoned by President Klaus shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 2015, police {{released}} a video {{from the night}} before the theft, that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape; one of them remains unidentified, while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the unidentified man into the museum twice within a few minutes. The man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> off. Police say the video opens new lines of investigation, and The New York Times points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator. However, the guards have previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist.|$|E
5000|$|Williams Renault, {{now without}} Switzerland’s Alain Menu {{who had left}} to join the Ford team, {{retained}} Jason Plato for his third season. Frenchman Jean-Christophe Bouillon landed the second Renault Laguna seat, who had driven for Sauber in Formula 1 in 1995, and subsequently campaigned sport <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> in the Renault Spider Eurocup.|$|R
5000|$|The robbers {{stopped the}} plane and then brandished their guns, {{stopping}} the pilots and transport security. The Brussels prosecutors' office described the weapons used as [...] "like Kalashnikovs", most likely the Galil. The robbers never dropped their weapons. The robbers loaded 130 bags into their <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> off, but left behind some gems in their hurry.|$|R

5|$|From Chicago, Bundy {{traveled}} by train to Ann Arbor, Michigan. There, on January 2 {{in a local}} tavern, he watched his alma mater UW defeat Michigan in the Rose Bowl. Five days later he stole a <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> to Atlanta, where he boarded a bus and arrived in Tallahassee, Florida, {{on the morning of}} January 8. He rented a room under the alias Chris Hagen at a boarding house near the Florida State University (FSU) campus. Bundy later said that he initially resolved to find legitimate employment and refrain from further criminal activity, knowing he could probably remain free and undetected in Florida indefinitely as long as he did not attract the attention of police; but his lone job application, at a construction site, had to be abandoned when he was asked to produce identification. He reverted to his old habits of shoplifting and stealing credit cards from women's wallets left in shopping carts.|$|E
5|$|General George S. Patton {{himself had}} a gunfight {{when he was}} a young second {{lieutenant}} chasing Pancho Villa all over northern Mexico in 1916. Patton and 10 enlisted men had been sent to San Miguelito Ranch to look for Villa, who had recently raided the city of Columbus, New Mexico. Patton positioned his men by the south gate and was making his way up to the north gate when a trio of Villa's men came into the ranch on horseback. Patton drew his obsolete single-action Colt Peacemaker revolver and shot two of the men. The first man had been fatally wounded in the exchange and tried to draw his pistol before Patton killed him with a single shot. After his troops took down the remaining outlaw, Patton tied the three dead men to the hood of his touring <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> the bodies back to his commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Gowing became Reader in Contemporary History {{at the new}} University of Kent, Canterbury, {{covering}} scientific, technical, {{economic and}} social history. The UKAEA retained her as a consultant, paying her £1,000 per annum for three years. Her main task was to write a two-volume sequel to Britain and Atomic Energy 1939–1945 covering the period from 1945 to 1952. To help out, the UKAEA brought in Lorna Arnold from its Health and Safety Division in 1967 to become the Departmental Records Officer (DRO) and Gowing's Assistant Historian. Despite their being accredited as official historians, the Atomic Weapons Establishment would not let them take their notes away, {{so they had to}} do their writing on site, {{under the watchful eye of}} Aldermaston's DRO. To get there Gowing had to catch the train each day from Canterbury to London Waterloo station, and then the Tube to Paddington and the railway to Reading, where Arnold picked Gowing up in her <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> to Harwell.|$|E
50|$|Kropp drove {{a couple}} of seasons in the Swedish and Nordic Formula Three series. His last race was in 2000. Kropp loved fast sports <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> Ferraris <b>and</b> Maseratis privately on the road. Together with von Braun Sports Cars he {{developed}} an advanced Ferrari F355 GT car for endurance racing. Only a few test races were made before he died.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, Tradin' Paint was {{the name}} of a one-hour special program where 4-time NASCAR Winston Cup {{champion}} Jeff Gordon and former CART champion and Formula One driver Juan Pablo Montoya traded race <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Formula One race course. The show was hosted by Bob Varsha, along with Fox Sports's NASCAR commentator Larry McReynolds and Speed's Formula One commentator Steve Matchett.|$|R
5000|$|Despite his nascent {{professional}} success, {{his marriage}} was strained by multiple infidelities and mutual alcohol abuse. Marianne eventually {{committed suicide in}} 1955, leaving him to raise their son and daughter alone. He described himself during this period as [...] "an anonymous institutional employee who drove to work each morning {{in a long line}} of commuter <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> home each night and drank martinis ... like several million middle-class, liberal, intellectual robots." ...|$|R
5|$|Pierce {{cast the}} actors by {{approaching}} customers {{at a local}} gas station whenever he saw somebody that looked like they fit one of the parts. He hired high school students as crew members who helped load and move equipment. For the creature itself, he limited the sightings to shadowy figures because he felt the film would be more frightening if the creature was left to the viewer's imagination. Pierce sang the theme song featured in the film. Once the film was completed, he put the reel {{into the trunk of}} his <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> to Los Angeles seeking post-production services. He met Jamie Mendoza-Nava, who owned a small post-production company and agreed to work on the film for limited up-front pay and {{a small percentage of the}} film's box-office receipts. Pierce could not find a major studio willing to distribute it, so he rented a local movie theater in Texarkana for one week to screen the film. He cleaned the property himself to prepare for the debut.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match of}} the event saw The Bad Guys, which {{consisted}} of Razor Ramon, the 1-2-3 Kid, the Davey Boy Smith, and The Headshrinkers (Sione and Fatu) versus The Teamsters, composed of Diesel, Shawn Michaels, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart, and Jim Neidhart. The opening minutes of the match featured brothers-in-law Hart and Smith trading moves as well as Jarrett and Ramon brawling. Fatu became the first wrestler eliminated after Diesel performed a Jackknife powerbomb on him. Diesel eliminated the 1-2-3 Kid forty-two seconds later after another Jackknife powerbomb. Sione followed thirty-one seconds later after being pinned by Diesel. Davey Boy Smith entered the ring, but Diesel soon knocked him between the ropes to the arena floor. Hart and Neidhart prevented Smith from getting back in the ring, and Smith was eliminated after the referee counted him out. Razor Ramon was left as {{the only member of}} his team to face the five members of The Teamsters. He fought with Diesel for several minutes, but Diesel then performed the Jackknife powerbomb on him and prepared to pin him for the victory. Michaels insisted on having Diesel hold Ramon while Michaels performed a superkick on their opponent. Ramon dodged the kick, and Michaels kicked Diesel in the face. Diesel became angry at Michaels, particularly because the same mistake had cost Diesel the Intercontinental Championship at SummerSlam. He and Michaels argued outside the ring {{while the rest of the}} team attempted to calm them down. The referee counted all five wrestlers out of the ring and declared Razor Ramon the winner of the match. Shawn Michaels was shown backstage after the match, and he stated that he was disbanding his tag team with Diesel and vacating the Tag Team Championship. He then got into a <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> away from the arena.|$|E
25|$|During {{the ride}} the car passed several service {{stations}} {{but the man}} did not stop. For about 90 minutes he drove back and forth around the backroads near Tracy. When Johns asked why he was not stopping, he would change the subject. When the driver finally stopped at an intersection, Johns jumped out with her daughter and hid in a field. The driver searched for her using his flashlight telling her {{that he would not}} hurt her, before eventually giving up. Unable to find her, he got back into the <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> off. Johns hitched a ride to the police station in Patterson.|$|E

5000|$|Psychiatrist Joseph Wolpe (19700900) {{carried out}} an {{experiment}} which demonstrated flooding. He took {{a girl who}} was scared of <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> her around for hours. Initially the girl was hysterical but she eventually calmed down when she realized that her situation was safe. From then on she associated a sense of ease with cars. [...] Psychologist Aletha Solter used flooding successfully with a 5-month-old infant who showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress following surgery.|$|R
25|$|On {{the night}} of 16 September 2013, Austrian police {{received}} a call about a suspected poacher in the woods near Annaberg, Lower Austria. Police officers sought to inspect the vehicle of 55-year-old Alois Huber, but he sped off upon spotting them and later crashed his car in a ditch near Annaberg. Huber then proceeded on foot and shot two police officers posted near a checkpoint in Annaberg. A Red Cross paramedic was also shot while providing aid to a wounded. One of the officers and the paramedic later died in the hospital, while the other officer survived his wounds. At another checkpoint, Huber shot and killed another officer while taking a fourth hostage. He then stole a police <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> it to his farmhouse near Melk.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Norris, at {{the time}} living with his birth parents, visited {{the home of a}} female {{relative}} in her early twenties and began talking in sexually suggestive terms to her. In response, this relative ordered him to leave her house. Norris' father was informed of this incident, and threatened to beat his son. In response, Norris stole his father's <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> into the Rocky Mountains, where he attempted to commit suicide by injecting pure air into an artery in his arm. He was later apprehended as a runaway, and returned to live with his parents. When he returned home, his parents informed Norris that he and his younger sister were both unwanted children, and that they had intended to divorce when both children reached adolescence.|$|E
25|$|He managed {{only one}} World Cup {{appearance}} though, after England failed {{to qualify for}} both the 1974 and 1978 tournaments. He finally reached a World Cup in 1982 when England got to the finals in Spain. He was duly named in the squad for the tournament but was suffering from a chronic back injury and was unfit {{to play in a}}ll of England's group games. In a last, desperate effort to play in a World Cup (he knew {{that he would not be}} around for the 1986 competition) he secretly hired a <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> from Spain to a specialist he knew in Germany for intensive treatment. He recovered sufficiently to appear as a substitute for the last 26 minutes of England's final Second Round game against hosts Spain. Unfortunately, though, his brief experience of World Cup football saw him miss a point-blank header which would have broken the deadlock, in a game England needed to win to progress to the semi-finals. England drew the game 0-0 and were eliminated from the competition.|$|E
50|$|He almost {{married a}} girl named Helen, who {{was a few years}} older than Robert and lived in nearby Marion. At the last minute, he turned the <b>car</b> around <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> her back home.|$|R

500|$|Returning to Toronto in {{the late}} seventies Davis spent several years as a radio drama {{director}} and on the faculty of Humber College. In demand as an acting teacher during this period, he resumed acting after an absence of nearly twenty years. Davis earned a number of roles on stage and film before accepting the position of artistic director of the Vancouver Playhouse Acting School, which required relocating with his wife and family. Davis writes in his memoir, [...] "And so, in the fall of 1985, we hitched our second hand boat to our second hand <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> across the country".|$|E
500|$|Feynman {{was working}} in the {{computing}} room when he was informed that Arline was dying. He borrowed Fuchs' <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> to Albuquerque where he sat with her for hours until she died on June 16, 1945. He immersed himself in work on the project and was present at the Trinity nuclear test. Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the very dark glasses or welder's lenses provided, reasoning that it was safe to look through a truck windshield, as it would screen out the harmful ultraviolet radiation. On witnessing the blast, Feynman ducked towards the floor of his truck because of the immense brightness of the explosion, where he saw a temporary [...] "purple splotch" [...] afterimage of the event.|$|E
500|$|On June 29, Jiyuan reappeared in Beijing, telling reporters, [...] "I came to Beijing {{in search}} of help." [...] He {{said that he had}} made two {{unsuccessful}} attempts to flee from custody before succeeding on his third try. While his official monitors were on the phone, Jiyuan fled to a friend's home, where he remained for two days. He removed the sim card and battery from his cell phone to prevent being tracked. [...] "I did not sleep or get any new clothes, I could not risk being arrested," [...] he recalled. They rented a <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> to Beijing, and Jiyuan recalled that [...] "I assumed there would be government people at the train station." [...] Whenever they neared police officers, he would {{get out of the car}} and walk to prevent being spotted.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2011, Tony Stewart and Lewis Hamilton {{participated in}} the [...] "Mobil 1 Seat Swap". Stewart drove his No. 14 Mobil 1 Chevy for four laps around the circuit while Hamilton drove the MP4-23, Vodafone McLaren Mercedes's entry in the 2008 Formula One season. After some time, both drivers swapped <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> more laps around the circuit. The event was {{open to the public}} and it was hoped that it would renew {{interest}} in the track. Before this event the curves on some of the turns were changed, the white rumble strips being replaced by the more common, red-white designs seen on most road courses around the world.|$|R
5000|$|... 2001: Rain on Saturday and Sunday morning {{left the}} track drenched with {{standing}} water. Down the backstretch toward Canada Corner, {{a steady stream}} of runoff water was cascading over the track. The race was started as scheduled, but on lap 5 Max Wilson crashed over top of Bryan Herta. The red flag was put out on lap 14, and the race would be shortened to 45 laps due to the two-hour time limit. Michael Andretti attempted to pass Christian Fittipaldi for the lead in turn five with nine laps remaining, but the two <b>cars</b> collided <b>and</b> slid high. Bruno Junqueira slipped by both <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> to victory - his first in the CART series. Memo Gidley survived a horrendous crash when his car hit one of the bridge abutments.|$|R
50|$|Although the WRC2000 {{looked almost}} {{identical}} to the WRC99, underneath the sheet metal, its execution was radically different. Developed by Prodrive engineer Christian Loriaux, the team used the {{lessons learned from the}} WRC99 and applied them in the WRC2000's 10-month development, in which over 80% of the <b>car's</b> mechanical <b>and</b> electronic components were redesigned. The <b>car</b> debuted, <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> to victory, at the fourth event of the season, Rally Portugal.|$|R
500|$|On 24 October Newton, now {{driving a}} Ford saloon, met Scott by {{arrangement}} in Combe Martin, {{just north of}} Barnstaple. Newton explained {{that he had to}} drive to Porlock, about 25 miles away, and suggested that Scott accompany him—he and Scott could talk on the journey. Scott had with him his recently acquired pet dog, a Great Dane called Rinka; this disconcerted Newton, who was afraid of dogs, but Scott insisted that Rinka go with them. At Porlock, Newton left Scott and Rinka at a hotel while he supposedly dealt with his business. He picked them up shortly after 8pm, and they began the drive back to Combe Martin. On a deserted stretch of road, Newton began to drive erratically, feigning tiredness, and accepted Scott's suggestion that he take over the driving. They stopped; Scott got out, followed by Rinka, and ran round to the driver's side, where he found Newton, gun in hand. Newton shot the dog in the head and, saying [...] "It's your turn now", pointed the gun at Scott. The pistol failed to fire several times; eventually Newton jumped into the <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> away, leaving Scott and the dead or dying dog by the roadside.|$|E
500|$|On January 7, 1973, Kemper, who had now {{moved back}} in with his mother, was driving around the Cabrillo College campus when he picked up 18-year-old student Cynthia Ann [...] "Cindy" [...] Schall. He drove to a sequestered wooded area and fatally shot her with a [...]22 caliber pistol. He then placed her body {{in the trunk of}} his <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> to his mother's house, where he kept her body hidden in a closet in his room overnight. When his mother left for work the next morning, he had sex with, and removed the bullet from, Schall's corpse before dismembering and decapitating it in his mother's bathtub. He kept the severed head for several days, {{regularly}} engaging in irrumatio with it, before burying it in his mother's garden facing upward toward her bedroom – later remarking that his mother [...] "always wanted people to look up to her." [...] He then discarded the rest of her remains by throwing them off a cliff. Over the course of the following few weeks, all but her head and right hand were discovered and [...] "pieced together like a macabre jigsaw puzzle". Police and a pathologist determined she had been hacked to death then cut into pieces with a power saw.|$|E
2500|$|The gunmen {{then left}} the scene, {{shouting}} (according to witnesses), [...] "We have avenged the Prophet Muhammad. We have killed Charlie Hebdo!" [...] They escaped in a getaway <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> to Porte de Pantin, hijacking another car and forcing its driver out. As they drove away, they ran over a pedestrian and shot at responding police officers.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, O'Young {{came across}} an {{opportunity}} to compete at the top level of touring <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> for Bamboo Engineering in the 2010 World Touring Car Championship season, as teammate to Harry Vaulkhard. His longtime sponsors LKM and A-Ha Coffee joined O'Young on his switch to touring <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> additional support came from Chevrolet Motorsport. He drove a 2008-spec Chevrolet Lacetti in the Independents Championship of the WTCC. In doing so, he has also become the first Chinese full-time driver in the FIA World Touring Car Championship. In race ten at Race of Portugal, Darryl scored his first win in the Independents Championship and also his first world championship point by finishing tenth overall. He arrived in Macau for the final round with a chance of winning the Independents Championship, but was hit by Tom Coronel from behind in race one, thus failing to finish and ending his championship hopes.|$|R
50|$|At 19h00 one evening, {{three women}} were {{meeting at the}} {{residence}} {{of one of them}} in order to travel to church together. Two of the women were already in the Volvo that was to be used to this end when the third woman arrived by car. As she began walking towards the Volvo in the driveway, three men in overalls moved towards the Volvo and pointed a gun at the last-arriving woman. They demanded that the women hand over their possessions, and also the keys to both cars. The women handed over everything. The men got into the two <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> <b>drove</b> off. The appellant was found in possession of the firearm and ammunition three days later, but there was nothing to link that firearm to the robbery.|$|R
50|$|In August 2003 {{motoring}} magazine <b>Car</b> <b>and</b> Driver test <b>drove</b> the Twin with mostly negative remarks. The Twin's acceleration, {{storage and}} interior furnishings were all criticized whilst its headroom and turning circle were praised.|$|R
