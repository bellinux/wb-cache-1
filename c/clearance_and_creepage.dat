40|$|The {{concept of}} More Electric Aircraft, where is {{to utilize the}} {{electrical}} power to drive more or all aircraft subsystem instead of conventional combination of pneumatic, hydraulic, mechanical and electrical power, can be recalled to World War II. It has been proven to have more advantages for decades in terms of energy efficiency, environmental issues, logistics and operational maintenance. It can also enhance aircraft weight, volume and battle damage reconfigurability. Thanks to the new electronics technologies {{and the emergence of}} new materials, It becomes feasible for high power density electrical power components to drive the majority of aircraft subsystem. However, sustaining the transmission of hundreds of kilowatts of electrical power at low voltages is not feasible owing to the penalties incurred due to high cable weights and voltage drop may become critical. It is very easy {{to come up with the}} solution of the increase of voltage. However, higher voltage will introduce other problems such as the reliability of insulation coordination on the aircraft due to the increased probability of electrical discharge. For aircraft designers, it is very important to understand the rules of insulation coordination on the aircraft including determining <b>clearance</b> <b>and</b> <b>creepage</b> distances, and also have a clear investigation of the phenomena and mechanism of electrical discharges. Past research has identified a number of the concerns of operating electrical systems at higher voltages in an aerospace environment, especially for dimensioning of clearances. However, there is little study on dimensioning of creepage distances and relevantly flashover and electrical tracking on solid insulating material surfaces. This thesis firstly discusses the rules for determining clearances and creepage distances. The experimental validation work was done for breakdown in air gap and on the solid insulating material surfaces under dry condition so that some standard recommended values can be evaluated not only with theoretical values such Paschen's law. Suggestions of application of those standards were provided. Secondly, the complex electrical discharge under wet condition on solid insulating material surfaces was discussed. A mathematical model to predict this type of electrical failure -electrical tracking (the electrical discharges on solid insulation materials which will lead to physical damage in the materials) with the consideration of different environmental conditions including air pressure, ambient temperature, and pollution degrees was developed. A series of electrical tracking tests were carried out on organic materials to find out the mechanism of electrical tracking and validate the finding by the mathematic model. Finite element analysis simulations were also conducted to find out the background thermal transfer mechanism to support our explanation of those phenomena of electrical tracking. Different test techniques have ben developed for specific impact factors. Finally, the suggestions for utilization of the standards and feasible test techniques for electrical tracking under wet conditions were provided.

The high-level plastic deformation {{on the wheel}} surface due to the combined effects of high contact stress <b>and</b> <b>creepage</b> conditions can accelerate this spheroidisation process by fracture and partial dissolution of cementite lamella in the pearlitic structure; this process is further enhanced by the increased dislocation density in the ferrite and ferrite/cementite interfaces during near-surface deformation due to accelerated carbon diffusion at dislocations [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].|$|R

The engineering method for design of the fatigue curves at asymmetric loading by a soft cycle has been developed. The models of the {{fatigue strength}} <b>and</b> cyclic <b>creepage</b> have been created. The tests for cyclic strength <b>and</b> <b>creepage</b> at axial loading of the cylindric samples have been made on the hydropulsator at frequency 350 cycles/min. The strength cycle asymmetry coefficients were changed with limits from - 4 to + 0, 75. The known dependence describing the fatigue curve at rigid straining has been modified on base of the obtained experimental data: the effective plasticity function modeling the material embrittlement with durability growth has been introduced instead located plasticity constant. At soft loading cycle the design is made on base of the modified formula at transfer from deformations to the stresses {{by means of the}} extension diagram. The methods for determination of the free parameters in the fatigue strength model have been developed.

The corresponding expressions for wheel-rail contact condition can be obtained by setting s 0  = ∞ and β =  0. Moreover, the longitudinal <b>and</b> lateral <b>creepages</b> can be simplified further by assuming that the contacting bodies remain in contact at all times which means the z components vanish in the expressions (35) and (36).|$|R

Using a retrospective review of data from 500 hospital patients we calculated glomerular filtration rate according to Cockcroft-Gault equation (C-G), Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation (CKD-EPI). We determined if results of these equations were compatible with creatinine <b>clearance,</b> <b>and</b> does stage of kidney disease, body-mass index (BMI), diabetes or old age {{have an impact on}} their ability to predict creatinine clearance. All of the equations showed high correlations with creatinine clearance, regardless of diabetes, overweight or old age. There was no statistical difference (p 65 years) and diabetics. The percentage of overweight subjects (BMI> 25) in false positives (subjects with normal creatinine <b>clearance</b> <b>and</b> decreased GFR) was 64. 8 % for C-G, 88. 6 % for MDRD and 88. 9 % for CKD-EPI. Large number of overweight subjects with normal creatinine <b>clearance</b> <b>and</b> decreased GFR would indicate that creatinine clearance overestimates GFR in overweight subjects. Passing-Bablok regression showed agreement between creatinine <b>clearance</b> <b>and</b> MDRD <b>and</b> creatinine <b>clearance</b> <b>and</b> CKD-EPI only in cases of severely decreased GFR (G 4 and G 5 stage of chronic kidney disease).

40|$|A {{model for}} the {{prediction}} of the initiation and growth of roughness on the rail is presented. The vertical interaction between a train and the track is calculated as a time history for single or multiple wheels moving on periodically supported rails, using a wavenumber-based approach. This vertical dynamic wheel/rail force arises from the varying stiffness due to discrete supports (i. e. parametric excitation) and the roughness excitation on the railhead. The tangential contact problem between the wheel and rail is modelled using an unsteady two-dimensional approach and also using the three-dimensional contact model, FASTSIM. This enables the slip and stick regions in the contact patch to be identified from the input geometry <b>and</b> <b>creepage</b> between the wheel and rail.
