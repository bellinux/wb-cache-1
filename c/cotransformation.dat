5000|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, Axel, along with {{microbiologist}} Saul J. Silverstein and geneticist Michael H. Wigler, discovered a technique of <b>cotransformation,</b> {{a process which}} allows foreign DNA to be inserted into a host cell to produce certain proteins. Patents, now colloquially {{referred to as the}} [...] "Axel patents", covering this technique were filed for February 1980 and were issued in August 1983. As a fundamental process in recombinant DNA research as performed at pharmaceutical and biotech companies, this patent proved quite lucrative for Columbia University, earning it almost $100 million a year at one time, and a top spot on the list of top universities by licensing revenue. The Axel patents expired in August 2000.|$|E
40|$|Fragments of {{chromosomal}} DNA from {{a variety}} of eucaryotes can act as ARSs (autonomously replicating sequence) in yeasts. ARSs enable plasmids to be maintained in extrachromosomal form, presumably because they function as initiation sites for DNA replication. We isolated eight different sequences from mouse chromosomal DNA which function as ARSs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (bakers' yeast). Although the replication efficiency of the different mouse ARSs in yeasts appears to vary widely, about one-half of them functions as well as the yeast chromosomal sequence ARS 1. Moreover, five of the ARSs also promote self replication of plasmids in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast). Each of the ARSs was cloned into plasmids suitable for transformation of mouse tissue culture cells. Plasmids were introduced into thymidine kinase (TK) -deficient mouse L cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique in the absence of carrier DNA. In some experiments, the ARS plasmid contained the herpes simplex virus type 1 TK gene; in other experiments (<b>cotransformations),</b> the TK gene was carried on a separate plasmid used in the same transformation. In contrast to their behavior in yeasts, none of the ARS plasmids displayed a significant increase in transformation frequency in mouse cells compared with control plasmids. Moreover, only 1 of over 100 cell lines contained the original plasmid in extrachromosomal form. The majority of cell lines produced by transformation with an ARS TK plasmid contained multiple copies of plasmid integrated into chromosomal DNA. In most cases, results with plasmids used in <b>cotransformations</b> were similar to those for plasmids carrying TK. However, cell lines produced by <b>cotransformations</b> with plasmids containing any one of three of the ARSs (m 24, m 25, or m 26) often contained extrachromosomal DNAs...|$|R

40|$|In {{mammalian}} cells {{the product}} of the human retinoblastoma tumour suppressor gene (pRb) can recruit Rpd 3 -like histone deacetylases to repress transcription. In this study, we investigated whether this mechanism might also be relevant in plants and found both conserved and distinct features. The expression profiles of the Zea mays Rpd 3 - type histone deacetylase (ZmRpd 3 I) and the retinoblastoma-related (ZmRBR 1) homologues were analysed during endosperm development. GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation experiments showed a physical interaction between ZmRBR 1 and ZmRpd 3 I. Because ZmRpd 3 I lacks a LXCXE motif, conserved in several pRb-interacting proteins, we have mapped the amino acid domains involved in the ZmRBR 1 /ZmRpd 3 I interaction. Furthermore, we observed that ZmRbAp 1, a maize member of the MSI/RbAp family, facilitated this protein interaction. <b>Cotransformations</b> of tobacco protoplasts with plasmids expressing ZmRBR 1 and ZmRpd 3 I showed that the two proteins cooperate in repressing gene transcription. Our findings represent the first indication that in plants a regulator of important biological processes, ZmRBR 1, can recruit a histone deacetylase, ZmRpd 3 I, to control gene transcription...|$|R
40|$|The Logarithmic Number System (LNS) makes multiplication, {{division}} and powering easy, but subtraction is expensive. <b>Cotransformation</b> converts the difficult operation of logarithmic subtraction into the easier operation of logarithmic addition. In this paper, a new variant of <b>cotransformation</b> is proposed, which is simpler {{to design and}} more economical in hardware than previous <b>cotransformation</b> methods. The novel method commutes operands differently for addition than for subtraction. Simulation results show how many guard bits are required by the new <b>cotransformation</b> to guarantee faithful rounding and that, even without guard bits, <b>cotransformation</b> produces an LNS unit more accurate than a previously published Hardware-Description-Language (HDL) library for LNS arithmetic that uses only multipartite tables or 2 nd-order interpolation...|$|E

This paper reviews the methods of interpolation, multipartite tables and <b>cotransformation</b> for LNS addition and subtraction, but special focus is given on a novel version of <b>cotransformation,</b> for which a new special case is identified. Synthesis results compare an already published Hardware Description Language (HDL) library for LNS arithmetic that uses only multipartite tables or 2 nd-order interpolation against a variation of the same library combined with <b>cotransformation.</b> Exhaustive simulation and a graphics example illustrate that the proposed library has smaller area requirements and is more accurate than the earlier library, at the cost of an increase in the latency of the hardware...|$|E
40|$|Background: Quantifying plant gene {{expression}} by flow cytometry (FCM) would allow multidimensional cell-parameter analysis on a per-cell basis, thereby providing {{insight into the}} cellular mechanisms of plant gene regulation. Here we sought to establish quantitation by FCM of plant hormone (abscisic acid, ABA) -inducible green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression and to compare the method directly with traditional reporter enzyme assays. Materials and Methods: GFP, beta -glucuronidase, and luciferase reporter genes driven by ABA-inducible or constitutive promoter constructs were expressed in transiently cotransformed rice protoplasts and reporter activities quantified by FCM (for GFP) or traditional enzyme assays. Treatments included <b>cotransformations</b> with specific ABA signaling effector cDNA constructs (encoding VIVIPAROUS- 1, an ABA transcription factor, and ABA-INSENSITIVE 1 - 1, a dominant-negative protein phosphatase regulator) and the ABA agonist lanthanum. chloride. Dual-color FCM was also performed on GFP-expressing cells immunodecorated with an mAb recognizing a rice cell surface epitope. Results: Quantitative analysis of ABA-inducible {{gene expression}} by FCM using GFP as reporter gave comparable results to traditional reporter enzyme assays, although the signal-to-noise ratio wits less for FCM, {{which can be a}} limitation of the method at low promoter strengths. Multiparameter-correlated analysis of ABA-inducible GFP expression with a plasma membrane marker showed no apparent correlation between ABA sensitivity, marked by GFP, and presence of a cell surface arabinogalactan glycoprotein. Conclusions: Quantitative FCM of GFP-cxpressing plant cells is a rapid, robust, reproducible, and value-added method relative to traditional enzymatic reporter gene assays.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{two different}} types of deformations for the linear group GL(n) which correspond to using of a general diagonal R-matrix. Relations between braided and quantum deformed algebras and their coactions on a quantum plane are discussed. We show that tensor-grading-preserving differential calculi can be constructed on braided groups, quantum groups and quantum planes for the case of the diagonal R-matrix. Deformations of the linear group GL(n), vector spaces and commutative algebras are intensively discussed in the theory of quantum groups [1 - 4]. More simple (G, f) -graded deformations of Lie algebras are well known [5, 6] and recently their R-matrix generalizations (braided algebras) have been considered [7, 8]. We shall discuss the simplest multiparametric deformations of the commutative algebra and linear group generating by a diagonal RD-matrix [9]. The general diagonal unitary R-matrix has the following form: where q(ji) are complex deformation parameters (RD) ij km = q(ji) δi kδ j m (1) q(ji) = 1 /q(ij), q(ii) = 1 (2) This R-matrix is a partial case X = 1 of the multiparametric nondiagonal R-matrix [10]. Let us define a quantum plane [2] as the formal-series algebra with generators x i (i = 1, 2 [...] . n) x i x j = (RD) ji km xk x m = q(ij) x j x i One can treat the deformed groups as different <b>cotransformations</b> on the quantum plane.

The regions of 12 S sufficient for T 24 ras <b>cotransformation</b> have been well characterized and {{are located in the}} first exon. The second exon is dispensable for ras <b>cotransformation,</b> although it contains a region which appears to modulate the transforming phenotype. The same 12 S first exon regions important in ras transformation are also necessary for E 1 B transformation. Analysis of an extensive series of second exon deletion and amino acid point mutations demonstrated that mutations affecting either the efficient nuclear localization and/or the immortalizing ability of the 12 S protein also prevented cooperation with E 1 B. In general, the entire C-terminal half of 12 S, including the nuclear localization signal, was necessary for efficient <b>cotransformation</b> with E 1 B. In addition to the differences between T 24 ras and E 1 B regarding 12 S regions necessary for <b>cotransformation,</b> the characteristics of E 1 B-cotransformed foci differed from those of T 24 ras. The E 1 B foci took longer to appear and had a much slower growth rate.

40|$|A GUS {{expression}} plasmid, pFunGus, {{was constructed}} containing a multi-cloning {{site for the}} insertion of gene regulatory elements, {{to be used in}} fungal reporter gene studies. A derivative of pFunGus (pFG-gpd) was constructed by the insertion of the gpdA promoter (glyceradehyde- 3 -phosphatc dehydrogenase) into the multi-cloning site of pFunGus for the assessment of the plasmid's transformation and expression properties in Aspergillus niduans. The correct construction of pFunGus and pFG-gpd was verified by analytical restriction digests and by its property of GUS expression in A. nidulans. The plasmid was integrated into the A. nidulans genome via <b>cotransformation</b> with the phleomycin resistance plasmid, pAN 8 -l. Transformation frequencies of between 3 and 250 transformants per µg of pAN 8 -l DNA were obtained. Initial screening for <b>cotransformation</b> yielded no pFG-gpd transformants. Attempts to improve <b>cotransformation</b> frequencies by optimisation of <b>cotransformation</b> conditions were unsuccessful. However, large scale screenings of transformants lead to cotransformants being isolated at a very low <b>cotransformation</b> frequency. Approximately 0. 45 % of pAN 8 -l transformants possessed the GUS phenotype. The eight pFG-gpd transformants obtained were analysed by Southern hybridisation. Six out of the eight transformants had a single copy integration. Of the remaining two transformants, one had three copies integrated at separate locations, one of which was disrupted, and the other had four copies integrated as tandem repeats, one of which was disrupted. All the transforming DNA appeared to be integrated ectopically. The physiology of the transformants was assessed by dry weight increase, colony extension and total protein content. These showed that the transformants biology was not significantly compromised by the transforming DNA. Finally, high levels of GUS expression were observed in all pFG-gpd transformants and the GUS expression per copy of the GUS expression cassette integrated into the genome was constant. These results showed that the transformed gene copy number determined the levels of gene activity rather than the position of integration in the genome. Overall these results demonstrate the potential application of the versatile GUS expression plasmid, pFunGus for reporter gene studies in filamentous fungi...|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} <b>cotransformation</b> in mammalian cells {{and its potential}} for identifying cells that have been modified by gene targeting. Selectable genes on separate DNA fragments were simultaneously introduced into cells by coelectroporation. When the introduced fragments were scored for random integration, 75 % of the transformed cells integrated both fragments within the genome of the same cell. When one of the cointroduced fragments was scored for integration at a specific locus by gene targeting, only 4 % of the targeted cells cointegrated the second fragment. Apparently, cells that have been modified by gene targeting with one DNA fragment rarely incorporate a second DNA fragment. Despite this limitation, {{we were able to}} use the <b>cotransformation</b> protocol to identify targeted cells by screening populations of colonies that had been transformed with a cointroduced selectable gene. When hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) targeting DNA was coelectroporated with a selectable neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) gene into embryonic stem (ES) cells, hprt-targeted colonies were isolated from the population of neo transformants at a frequency of 1 per 70 G 418 -resistant colonies. In parallel experiments with the same targeting construct, hprt-targeted cells were found at a frequency of 1 per 5, 500 nonselected colonies. Thus, an 80 -fold enrichment for targeted cells was observed within the population of colonies transformed with the cointroduced DNA compared with the population of nonselected colonies. This enrichment for targeted cells after <b>cotransformation</b> should be useful in the isolation of colonies that contain targeted but nonselectable gene alterations...|$|E

The <b>cotransformation</b> frequency was about 30 % when selection was for pyrimidine prototrophy (Pyr+) and 87 % when selection was for benomyl-resistant (Bmlr) transformants. Southern blots confirmed that both transforming DNAs had integrated into the genomes of transformants which were expressing both Pyr+ and Bmlr phenotypes. A plasmid, p 23, which contained a truncated 500 -bp segment representing the central region of the PYR 1 gene was constructed. The plasmid was introduced with pCG 7, containing TUB 1 R 1, into G. graminicola M 1. 001 (Pyr+ Bmls), and Bmlr transformants were selected. The Bmlr transformants were screened on medium which did not contain uridine {{in order to identify}} Pyr- mutants created by integration of p 23 at the PYR 1 locus. None of the primary transformants were Pyr-, but 0. 2 % of uninucleate conidia collected from the pooled primary transformants gave rise to Pyr- auxotrophs. Southern blots representing two of these Pyr- mutants confirmed that they had the expected homologous integration of p 23 at the PYR 1 locus. This suggested that integration resulted in production of two nonfunctional copies of the gene, one lacking the 5 ′ sequences and the other lacking the 3 ′ sequences.

The transformation vector B 10 S confers resistance to the antibiotic G 418 and was always presented to amoebae as a closed circle. Cotransforming DNA, containing a slime mold cDNA and sequences homologous to the primary vector, was presented either as a closed circle or as a linear molecule after digestion with restriction endonucleases which cut within one of three distinct regions of the plasmid. Remarkably, homologous recombination occurred in every clone examined. Moreover, the products of recombination were identical in all instances, irrespective of the presence or position of linearized ends. The ends of the linear templates were not recombinogenic. Repair of the introduced double-strand break occurred frequently during recombination. The repair could occur intermolecularly or, more likely, intramolecularly, i. e., by recircularization.

Here we show that Mad also blocks transformation of primary rat embryo fibroblasts by c-Myc and the adivated c-Ha-Ras oncoproteins. Mad mutants lacking either the basic region, the leucine zipper, or an intad NH 2 -terminal protein interadion domain fail to inhibit Myc-Ras <b>cotransformation.</b> These results indicate that the repression of <b>cotransformation</b> requires DNA-binding and is mediated by multiple protein-protein interadions involving both Max and mSin 3, a putative mammalian corepressor protein. With increasing amounts of the cotransfeded myc gene, the numbers of transformed foci are reduced and the ability of Mad to inhibit focus formation is attenuated. Moreover, cell lines derived from such foci constitutively express both Myc and Mad proteins. Whereas Bcl- 2 can significantly increase the numbers of transformed foci by enhancing the survival of myc-ras-transfeded cells, it does not counterad the repressive effects of Mad on transformation, suggesting that Mad affeds the growth properties rather than the viability of cells.

Remarkably, 10 to 30 % of the selected A. thaliana shoots or progenies lost the T-DNA marker they were selected on.

40|$|In {{a variety}} of organisms, DNA-mediated {{transformation}} experiments commonly produce transformants with multiple copies of the transforming DNA, including both selected and unselected molecules. Such ``cotransformants'' are much more common than expected from the individual transformation frequencies, suggesting that subpopulations of cells, or nuclei, are particularly competent for transformation. We found that Neurospora crassa transformants selected for gene replacement at the am gene had not efficiently incorporated additional DNA, suggesting that nuclei that undergo transformation by homologous recombination are not highly competent at integration of DNA by illegitimate recombination. Spheroplasts were treated with DNA fragments homologous to am and with an Escherichia coli hph plasmid. Transformants were initially selected for hph (hygromycin(R)), allowed to conidiate to generate homokaryons and then selected for either Am(-) (gene replacements) or hph. Surprisingly, most am replacement strains were hygromycin(S) (124 / 140) and carried no extraneous DNA (116 / 140). Most transformants selected for hph also had ectopic copies of am DNA and/or multiple copies of hph sequences (32 / 35), generally at multiple sites, confirming that efficient <b>cotransformation</b> could occur. To test the implication that <b>cotransformation</b> involving gene replacement and ectopic integration is rare, we compared the yields of am replacement strains with or without prior selection for hph.

By using the atpB gene as the selected marker and cells grown in 0. 5 mM 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine, we have recovered up to 50 transformants per microgram of DNA. This method is easy and does not require specialized equipment, although it is not as efficient as the tungsten particle bombardment method [Boynton, J. E., Gillham, N. W., Harris, E. H., Hosler, J.

By using particle bombardment, we have developed a <b>cotransformation</b> approach in which spectinomycin-resistant 16 S rRNA-encoding DNA is the selected marker, and we have demonstrated that <b>cotransformation</b> of an unselected marker on an independent replicon is very efficient. We have used this strategy (i) to recover transformants with partially deleted atpB genes that could not otherwise have been selected since they did not restore photosynthetic capability to a recipient carrying a more extensive atpB deletion and (ii) to generate specific deletion mutations in a wild-type recipient. This methodology should allow the introduction of any desired change into the chloroplast genome, {{even in the absence of}} phenotypic selection, and thus a detailed functional analysis of any chloroplast DNA sequence should be possible...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a high-frequency <b>cotransformation</b> system which is useful in introducing nonreplicating circular DNA plasmids into the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This system depends on two factors: {{the ability of the}} ural-complementing helper plasmids pFYM 2 and pFYM 225 to propagate autonomously in S. pombe, and the intensive recombination activity intrinsic to this yeast. If cotransformed with a helper plasmid, plasmids such as YIp 5 or YIp 32, Escherichia coli-Saccharomyces cerevisiae shuttle vectors incapable of replication in S. pombe, can enter S. pombe and express the gene carried on them at a frequency comparable to that of autonomously replicating plasmids (10 (3) to 10 (4) transformants per microgram of DNA). Even if characters of the nonreplicating DNA are not selected directly, 50 to 70 % of Ura+ cells transformed with the helper have also incorporated the nonreplicating plasmid. It is shown that these two plasmids have physically recombined at a site of common DNA sequence to form a heteropolymer in the fission yeast. Since any foreign DNA cloned in pBR 322 or ColE 1 derivatives can be incorporated into S. pombe by using pFYM 2 or pFYM 225 as a helper, this <b>cotransformation</b> system will serve as a convenient method to examine functional expression of such cloned DNA in S. pombe. This work also demonstrates that the kanamycin resistance gene carried by the bacterial transposon Tn 903 can be expressed in S. pombe, as shown by its ability to inactivate the antibiotic G 418...|$|E
40|$|A {{collection}} of deletion mutations was {{generated in the}} U 5 region of cloned DNA copies of Moloney murine leukemia virus or a related retrovirus. Cell lines expressing the mutant DNAs were generated by <b>cotransformation,</b> and the virions released were characterized biochemically. Deletions in the 5 ' part of U 5 profoundly reduced packaging of the viral RNA into virions; one deletion in the 3 ' part of U 5 did not block packaging but affected reverse transcription. One mutant with a deletion in {{the central part of}} U 5 was fully viable and served to separate the two functional parts of U 5...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} nonlethal {{selection}} scheme, {{most often}} using the aadA gene that confers resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin, has been considered critical for recovery of plastid transformation events. In this study, the plastid-lethal markers, glyphosate or phosphinothricin herbicides, were used to develop a selection scheme for plastids that circumvents the need for integration of an antibiotic resistance marker. The effect of selective agents on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) mesophyll chloroplasts was first examined by transmission electron microscopy. We found that at concentrations typically used for selection of nuclear transformants, herbicides caused rapid disintegration of plastid membranes, whereas antibiotics had no apparent effect. To overcome this apparent herbicide lethality to plastids, a “transformation segregation” scheme was developed that used two independent transformation vectors for a <b>cotransformation</b> approach and two different selective agents in a phased selection scheme. One transformation vector carried an antibiotic resistance (aadA) marker used for early nonlethal selection, and the other transformation vector carried the herbicide (CP 4 or bar) resistance marker {{for use in a}} subsequent lethal selection phase. Because the two markers were carried on separate plasmids and were targeted to different locations on the plastid genome, we reasoned that segregation of the two markers in some transplastomic lines could occur. We report here a plastid <b>cotransformation</b> frequency of 50 % to 64 %, with a high frequency (20 %) of these giving rise to transformation segregants containing exclusively the initially nonselected herbicide resistance marker. Our studies indicate a high degree of persistence of unselected transforming DNA, providing useful insights into plastid chromosome dynamics...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} was {{developed}} to study transient gene expression, stable transformation, and <b>cotransformation</b> in suspension cells, such as mouse myeloma and erythroleukemia cells. This method involves attachment of cells to a concanavalin A-coated tissue culture dish, treatment of cells with DEAE-dextran to adsorb plasmid DNA to the attached cells, and finally treatment with a 40 % solution of polyethylene glycol to facilitate the uptake of DNA by the cells. Plasmids pSV 2 cat and pSV 2 neo were used as markers to optimize the conditions for transient gene expression and stable transformation, respectively, of mouse myeloma and erythroleukemia cells. This method was successfully used to obtain cotransformants of mouse myeloma cells...|$|E
