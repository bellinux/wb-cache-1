40|$|Metaldehyde is used {{widely in}} Malaysia for the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>molluscs.</b> This {{communication}} reports the cytotoxic {{effects of this}} chemical on cultured cells as assessed by cell morphology and the DNA synthesing capability {{as well as its}} transport into cells. After 15 days of exposure with 20. 0 ppm of the compound, the DNA synthesising capability was shown to be unaffected. The IC 50 for Vero cells was 276. 0 ppm. Transport of thymidine across cells was found to be not significantly affected even at high metaldehyde concentrations (up to 320. 0 ppm) suggesting integrity of cells were not significantly affected. The present cellular studies have therefore shown that the cytotoxic effects of this chemical is rather low...|$|E

40|$|Grassland {{restoration}} is {{the dominant}} activity funded by agri-environment schemes (AES). However, the re-instatement of biodiversity and ecosystem services is limited {{by a number of}} severe abiotic and biotic constraints resulting from previous agricultural management. These appear to be less severe on ex-arable sites compared with permanent grassland. We report findings of a large research programme into practical solutions to these constraints. The key abiotic constraint was high residual soil fertility, particularly phosphorus. This can most easily be addressed by targeting of sites of low nutrient status. The chief biotic constraints were lack of propagules of desirable species and suitable sites for their establishment. Addition of seed mixtures or green hay to gaps created by either mechanical disturbance or herbicide was the most effective means of overcoming these factors. Finally, manipulation of biotic interactions, including hemiparasitic plants to reduce competition from grasses and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>mollusc</b> herbivory <b>of</b> sown species, significantly improved the effectiveness of these techniques...|$|R

50|$|Both central ganglia and {{peripheral}} neurons {{are often}} {{involved in the}} neural <b>control</b> <b>of</b> behavior in <b>molluscs.</b> In molluscs such as Aplysia californica the peripheral motor neurons are more extensive, as opposed to vertebrates, and innervate somatic (locomotor and appendageal) muscles. Central pathways are activated by weak stimuli applied at {{some distance from the}} target effector structure and peripheral pathways are activated when the stimuli is applied at a distance or directly on the target effector structure.|$|R
40|$|The <b>controlled</b> nursery culturing <b>of</b> <b>mollusc</b> spat {{produced}} by millions in commercial hatcheries is an intermediate step in mollusc farming which is receiving {{more and more}} attention. Different technologies for nursery culturing indoors as well as outdoors have been developed at different places. The principles are always basically the same and consist of culturing postlarvae of a few milimeters in size up to a size of a few centimeters in densities as high as possible in specific devices in seawater which is eventually enriched with live unicellular algae or inert foods. This paper reports on the first results obtained in Belgium in an indoor experimental nursery with spat of Ostrea edulis, Crassostrea gigas and Venerupis semidecussata. On {{the basis of the}} results obtained in this small experimental unit, a semi-industrial pilot-scale plant has been designed and has recently been built at the border of the Sluice-dock in Ostend, Belgium. This pilot nursery has been conceived as a multivariable unit the ultimate goal of which is to determine the cost-benefit of an industrial nursery utilizing the heated effluent of a power-plant...|$|R
