40|$|Since the Enlightenment, liberal {{democratic}} governments in Europe and North America have been compelled {{to secure the}} legitimacy of their authority by constructing rational states whose rationality is based on modern forms of law. The first serious challenge to {{liberal democratic}} practices of legal legitimacy <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>Marx's</b> early writings on Rousseau and Hegel. In addition to examining Marx's critique of Kant, Hegel, and liberalism, Beyond Hegemony investigates {{the reasons for the}} authoritarianism and breakdown of state socialist governments in Russia and elsewhere claiming to put Marx's ideas on democracy and equality into practice. The book explains that although Marx's critique remains valid today, his ideas need to be supplemented by the contributions to social theory made by Nietzsche, Foucault, the critical theory of the Frankfurt School as well as the libertarian socialism of G. D. H. Cole. What emerges is a new theory of political legitimacy which indicates how it is possible to move beyond liberal democracy whilst avoiding the authoritarian turn of state socialism...|$|R

Chum salmon count numbers were {{at or below}} the historical median for the past 6  years, based on unpublished chum salmon count data provided by Mr. Steve Heinl, an Alaska Department of Fish and Game fisheries biologist (S. Heinl unpublished salmon count data 6 June 2013). Since 1986, the median number of salmon counted <b>in</b> <b>Marx</b> Creek is 1, 223 fish, and the mean is 3, 370 fish. However, since 2007, the median number of salmon counted <b>in</b> <b>Marx</b> Creek was 243 fish, and the mean was 420 fish. According to Mr. Heinl, {{the reason for the}} reduction in chum salmon using Marx Creek is unknown, as other nearby salmon-spawning streams that drain to the Portland Canal have been productive over the past 4  years (S. Heinl personal communication 5 June 2013). Ongoing study of this problem is occurring in an attempt to determine the cause of the salmon reduction <b>in</b> <b>Marx</b> Creek.|$|R
