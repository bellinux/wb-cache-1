40|$|Background: Seroma {{formation}} {{is a common}} complication after breast cancer surgery. Several techniques such as tube drainage, fibrin sealant and suturing methods have been employed to prevent or reduce seroma formation. <b>Capitonnage,</b> a suturing method widely used following hydatid cyst removal, has been used after breast surgery in limited studies. Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of tube drainage, fibrin sealant and <b>capitonnage</b> to prevent early complications. Methods: Eligible patients with breast cancer who were candidate for breast conserving surgery were enrolled and randomized into three different groups (tube drainage, <b>capitonnage,</b> <b>capitonnage</b> plus fibrin sealant). Patients were visited on 5 th, 12 th and 19 th days after surgery and were assessed for any probable complications. Results: A total of 90 patients were enrolled. One patient developed seroma in tube drainage and <b>capitonnage</b> group, while no participant from <b>capitonnage</b> plus fibrin sealant group experienced the mentioned complication. Three patients developed skin necrosis, {{all of them were}} treated with <b>capitonnage</b> plus fibrin sealant protocol. Conclusions: Based on our observations, it seems that <b>capitonnage</b> alone or in combination with fibrin sealant do not lead to significant differences in frequency of complications after breast cancer surgery such as hematoma, seroma and surgical site infection...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPulmonary hydatid disease {{still remains}} an {{important}} healthcare problem. Conservative operative interventions including cystotomy or cystotomy with <b>capitonnage</b> {{are the two}} commonly used techniques. There is still significant controversy, however, over selection of these two procedures. In this retrospective analysis of 66 patients with hydatid disease, we employed three types of interventions, Group A, (n =  5) cystotomy alone with closure of bronchial openings; Group B, (n =  54) cystotomy with <b>capitonnage</b> and Group C, (n =  7) lobectomy {{over a period of}} seven years in our patients and compared their postoperative outcome in terms of morbidity and mortality. Our data show that cystotomy with <b>capitonnage</b> is associated with low rates of postoperative prolonged air leak, bronchopleural fistula formation, empyema formation [mean complication rate 0. 12 % (Mean 0. 08; 0. 151 – 95 % CI) ] as compared to cystotomy alone with closure of bronchial openings [mean complication rate 44 % (Mean 2. 20; 3. 18 – 95 % CI) ]. The lobectomy group was excluded from the comparison, as this approach {{is quite different from the}} cystostomy based enucleation techniques. We conclude that <b>capitonnage</b> with cystotomy may be a preferred procedure due to its lower rate of complications...|$|E
40|$|Objective: There is {{controversy}} {{concerning the}} management of the remaining cavity after the evacuation of a cyst in patients who have undergone surgical operation for liver hydatidosis. This study compares the results of <b>capitonnage</b> and tube drainage of the remaining cavity. Methods: In this retrospective study, participants were selected from two groups of patients with a liver hydatid cyst who underwent <b>capitonnage</b> or tube drainage from 2004 to 2012. The patients were followed for 6 – 24 months. The data of age, sex, involved liver lobe, size of the cyst, complications, drain duration, and hospital stay were analyzed. Results: Participants included 155 patients consisting of 96 (61. 94 %) females and 59 (38. 06 %) males. Most cysts were in the right lobe, and the most common diameter of the cysts was greater than 10  cm. <b>Capitonnage</b> was performed on 90 (58. 06 %) patients and the tube drainage procedure was performed on the remaining 65 (41. 94 %) patients. In the tube drainage group and the <b>capitonnage</b> group, the operative times were 2. 21  ±  0. 65 hours and 2. 53  ±  0. 35 hours, respectively; the hospital stays were 5. 695  ±  3. 37 days and 4. 43  ±  2. 96 days, respectively; the drain duration was 9. 2  ±  1. 7 days and 2. 1  ±  0. 4 days, respectively; and the time to return to work was 14. 7  ±  2. 3 days and 8. 3  ±  10. 4 days, respectively. All variables were statistically significant, except for the operative time. Cavity infection and biliary fistula were identified in three patients and six patients, respectively, in the tube drainage group and identified in two patients and three patients, respectively, in the <b>capitonnage</b> group. This difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that <b>capitonnage</b> versus the tube drainage method may result in a shorter hospital stay, decreased time to return to work, and low rate of morbidity and complications...|$|E
40|$|A 26 -year-old man {{presented}} with dyspnoea and pneumothorax diagnosed by chest radiography.

He was referred for a thoracoscopy to investigate the possible causes of the non-resolving pneumothorax, during which a large ruptured, crumpled hydatid cyst in the right pleural space, without empyema, was found. With a limited right thoracotomy, the crumpled laminated membrane of the hydatid cyst was removed. After extraction of the remaining particle of the laminated membrane of the same hydatid cyst in the right lower lobe and suturing of the bronchial opening, the pericyst layer was <b>capitonnaged.</b> Apart from common causes of pneumothorax in endemic areas, ruptured pulmonary hydatid cyst {{should be considered in}} pneumothoraces with an unusual clinical course...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeThe aim of {{this study}} is to compare two methods of <b>capitonnage</b> and uncapitonnage in the surgery of {{uncomplicated}} pulmonary hydatid cysts. Methods 502 patients with pulmonary hydatid cysts who were managed surgically were evaluated retrospectively from 1994 to 2007. The medical records and types of surgery of 234 patients with intact pulmonary hydatid cysts were collected. Patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 patients were operated using <b>capitonnage</b> and group 2 patients using uncapitonnage methods. Postoperative complications of two groups were compared. Results 84 patients of group 1 with a mean age of 28. 81  ±  9. 37 years were operated using <b>capitonnage</b> method and 150 patients of group 2 with a mean age of 31. 04  ±  8. 62 years without <b>capitonnage</b> method. In the comparison of postoperative complications (pneumothorax, empyema and pneumonia) in two groups the results obtained from group 1 were significantly more advantageous over group 2 (P <  0. 001). Total hospitalization time of group 1 was (5. 2  ±  2. 3) days and (5. 9  ±  3. 1) days for group 2 (P =  0. 03). The duration of air leak was 2. 1  ±  1. 8 days for group 1, and 6. 7  ±  3. 5 days for group 2 (P <  0. 001). There was significant statistical difference between two groups regarding the development of prolonged air leak and empyema. One and three cases of recurrence were observed in group 1 and group 2 respectively. There was no significant difference regarding the rate of disease recurrence between two groups. No mortality was reported in both groups. ConclusionWe conclude that the <b>capitonnage</b> method has more advantages in surgery of uncomplicated pulmonary hydatid cysts...|$|E
40|$|The {{surgical}} {{approach to}} hydatid cyst of the lung {{is based on}} complete removal of the parasite, {{and management of the}} residual pericyst cavity. For the latter, <b>capitonnage</b> is a recognized method, by which the walls of the evacuated pericyst cavity are approximated with multiple sutures. <b>Capitonnage</b> without suturing and ligation of bronchial openings individually may lead to postoperative air leakage with resultant pneumothorax or pneumatocele.

40|$|Of 1055 {{patients}} treated surgically for pulmonary hydatid disease, most (950) had isolated lung cysts, the other 105 having both liver and lung cysts. The chest radiograph was most valuable in diagnosis; the Casoni and Weinberg tests and blood eosinophil counts {{were found to}} be diagnostically unreliable. One thousand and seventy seven primary operations were performed. Cystotomy and <b>capitonnage</b> were carried out in 906 patients, 40 of whom also had decortication of the pleura. Other procedures included cystotomy with wedge resection of locally damaged lung (29 patients) and cyst removal with <b>capitonnage</b> by Ugon's method (33) or the Perez-Fontana procedure (8) and with costal resection for osteomyelitis in two cases. More radical surgery was carried out in 99 patients for longstanding infection or severe lung destruction. Postoperative complications occurred in 37 patients (3. 5 %) and the 30 day mortality rate was 1. 7 %. It is concluded that a lung conserving surgical operation is the treatment of choice for most patients with pulmonary hydatid disease.

40|$|Background. Cyst hydatid {{disease of}} the liver is still endemic in certain regions of the world. Currently, {{surgical}} operation remains the treatment of choice in hydatidosis. The cyst cavity can be managed by using <b>capitonnage,</b> external drainage, introflexion or omentoplasty. Methods. Two hundred and thirty-five patients operated for hydatid cyst between January 1990 and February 2001 were analysed retrospectively. Either omentoplasty, external drainage, <b>capitonnage</b> or introflexion were used to treat residual cyst cavity. Results. Patients were categorised into three groups to evaluate complications: omentoplasty alone (group A), omentoplasty combined with other techniques (group B) and other techniques (group C). The overall mortality rates were < 1 %. Overall morbidity rates were 8. 8 % for group A, 19 % for group B and 25 % for group C, respectively. Mean hospital stay was 7. 6 days for group A, 11. 9 days for group B and 15. 8 days for group C. Discussion. Postoperative surgical site infection, bile fistula, recurrence rate and overall morbidity were seen less frequently in patients who underwent omentoplasty in our series. Mean duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter in patients who underwent omentoplasty operations. Because omentum has a high absorptive capacity and the capability to fill the residual cavity, we recommend omentoplasty to manage patients with hydatid cyst of the liver, whether complicated or uncomplicated...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveIn this {{clinical}} {{retrospective study}} cystotomy and <b>capitonnage</b> were compared {{in patients with}} childhood pulmonary hydatid cysts with regard to postoperative period. MethodsBetween 1990 and 2004, 60 children with pulmonary hydatid cysts were treated surgically. There were 33 boys and 27 girls aged from 3 to 16 years. Cystotomy and closure of bronchial openings were performed in all patients. The patients were divided into 2 groups. While the residual cyst cavity was closed by means of <b>capitonnage</b> in group A (n = 37), cystotomy was applied in group B (n = 23). ResultsThere was no mortality in either group. Chest tubes were removed after 3. 59 ± 1. 04 days in group A and 5. 83 ± 2. 84 days in group B. The hospital stay was 4. 86 ± 1. 43 days for group A and 7. 22 ± 3. 34 days for group B. Prolonged air leak was found in 2 children in group A and 7 children in group B. There {{was a significant difference}} between group A and group B with regard to chest tube removal time (P =. 001), hospital stay (P =. 003), development of prolonged air leak (P =. 004), and all complications (P =. 031). Follow-up information was available for 49 children, ranging from 13 to 86 months (mean, 56 months).

40|$|AbstractBackground: Hydatid {{disease is}} a {{parasitic}} infection caused by Echinococcus granulosus, characterized by cystic lesions in the liver, lungs, and, rarely, {{in other parts of}} the body. The large cysts in the lung are a special clinical entity called giant hydatid cysts. Characteristics on presentation, operative techniques, and postoperative morbidity and mortality rates in 47 patients with 50 giant pulmonary hydatid cysts 10 cm in diameter or larger were reported in this study. Methods: Cystotomy plus the obliteration of the residual cavity by imbricating sutures from within (<b>capitonnage)</b> was the most frequently used operative technique (n = 31), followed by pericystectomy plus <b>capitonnage</b> (n = 6), closure of bronchial openings plus pericystectomy (n = 6), and lobectomy (n = 3). Results: The mean age of patients with giant hydatid cyst of the lung was lower than the age of those with usual-sized cysts (p = 0. 04). Five patients had prolonged air leaks (more than 10 days), three had empyema, and one had pneumonia in the opposite lung after the operation. One patient died of cardiorespiratory collapse during the operation. There was one recurrence during follow-up. Conclusions: The increase in the diameter of the cyst in younger ages was correlated with higher lung tissue elasticity and the delay in diagnosis because of delayed symptoms in these patients. Although postoperative complications occurred in 19. 1 % of patients, all were managed by conservative measures, and there were no indications that the affected lung should have been treated with resection instead of a parenchyma-saving operation.

Material and Method: Between 2002 and 2011, 29 patients with both lung and liver hydatid cyst were examined. Among those, 21 patients had cysts located on the dome of the liver. Those patients were operated on with phrenotomy through a right thoracotomy. 21 patients are retrospectively examined by reviewing age, gender, symptoms, cyst sizes, operation methods, operation duration, and complications. Results: The age mean was 60, 0 ± 16, 72. Of the 21 operated patients, 8 were males and 13 were females. While cough and abdominal pain were the most common symptoms, isolated abdominal pain was observed at 2 patients. 4 patients were asymptomatic. It is found that the average diameter was 7, 50 ± 1, 29 for lung cysts, 7, 0 ± 1, 76 for liver cysts. Lung cysts were managed through cystotomy with / without <b>capitonnage</b> or wedge methods. On the other hand, the chosen method for liver cyst was cystotomy and cavity invertion with drainage of subdiaphragmatic area. The average operation duration was 145, 0 ± 15, 26 minutes. Prolonged biliary drainage was observed at two patients. There was no mortality. Discussion: The transdiafragmatic liver cyst management by frenetomy via right thorocotomy is a reliable and effective method at patients with simultaneous right lung and subdiafragmatic liver hydatid disease patients...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: Hydatid {{disease is}} endemic in many {{countries}} throughout the world. Although {{we do not have}} exact figures, the disease is prevalent in Turkey. A considerable number of patients have additional liver cysts as well. In this study we reviewed our experience with hydatid disease of the lung and liver and discussed the principles of treatment. Methods: From 1971 to 1999, 2509 patients with pulmonary hydatidosis were referred to us, and 485 of them had concomitant liver cysts. Of these, 405 patients had cysts located on the dome of the liver, and they were operated on with phrenotomy through a right thoracotomy. Eighty patients who were found to have concomitant liver cysts in {{the lower part of the}} liver were referred to general surgery for a laparotomy. Results: Hydatid cysts located in the lungs were managed by means of cystotomy and <b>capitonnage.</b> For liver cysts, cystotomy and inversion of the cavity with sutures was the surgical method of choice, and a drain was left in place. In case of multiple cysts in the liver, needle aspiration was preferred. Twelve major complications, including excessive biliary drainage and bronchobiliary fistula, occurred in these patients. Conclusions: We believe that management of pulmonary and hepatic cysts simultaneously through the thoracic route is convenient and should be encouraged in patients because this prevents a second operation. Needle aspiration can be applied only for liver cysts. It is absolutely contraindicated in lung hydatid cysts. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2002; 124 : 1212 -...|$|E
40|$|Management {{option of}} hepatic {{echinococcosis}} represents {{a major challenge}} for a surgeon. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate surgical treatment of patients with hepatic echinococcosis at the surgery department of the regional hospital in Prizren (Kosovo). The medical records of 22 patients operated for hepatic echinococcosis in our department during a four year study period (2009 – 2013) were retrospectively reviewed. Apart from the total of 5850 operated patients, 22 cases were diagnosed for liver echinococcosis (0. 4 %). The most affected age group was from 26 to 50 years (54. 5 %). Female gender, 16 cases (73 %), and patients living in rural places, 14 patients (64 %), dominated significantly. The most affected region was Municipality of Dragash. All patients underwent ultrasonography, 13 patients underwent CT scans and 5 patients MRI of abdomen. The mean preoperative ultrasonographic diameter of cysts was 9. 5  cm and maximal 21  cm. Cysts were most often localized in right hepatic lobe (77 %) and subcostal laparotomy was most commonly performed (82 %). The performed surgical procedures were: endocystectomy and partial pericystectomy with omentoplication according to Papadimitris (73 %), endocystectomy and <b>capitonnage</b> and endocystectomy with external drainage (14 %). The laparoscopic approach was used only in one patient. In conclusion, hepatic echinococosis was not common among operated patients at our surgery department. Subcostal laparotomy with endocystectomy and partial pericystectomy with omentoplication according to Papadimitris was most commonly used. Exact distribution of echinococcosis is needed to be analyzed with a larger cohort study including all surgery units in the country and with a longer monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Background. Hydatid cyst (HC) {{disease is}} endemic in many {{developing}} countries, like Yemen, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, especially in the rural regions. The disease has a variable clinical courses and even might be asymptomatic for many years. Objectives. In giant and large pulmonary hydatid cysts, pulmonary resection is the usual method of surgical treatment. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the lung conservative surgery in treatment of cases with giant and large hydatid lung cysts, as an effective method of management. Patients and Methods. Between January 2009 and August 2014, a total of 148 patients with pulmonary hydatid cysts were operated and their data was reviewed retrospectively and analyzed. Out of these cases, 52 (35. 14 %) cysts with more than 10 [*]cm in diameter and 36 (24. 32 %) cysts with 5 – 9 [*]cm were regarded as giant and large hydatid lung cysts, respectively. The small cysts less than 5 [*]cm were presented in 8 (5. 4 %) cases only; other cases had ruptured cysts. Preservation of the lung tissues during surgery by cystotomy and <b>Capitonnage</b> was our conservative surgical methods of choice. Results. Eight patients developed bronchopleural fistula (BPF); of them, 4 BPFs have healed with chest tube and physiotherapy, but in the other 4 patients reoperation was done for the closure of persistent BPF. No mortality was observed in the present study. Conclusion. We conclude that conservative surgical procedure can achieve complete removal of the pulmonary hydatid cyst. Enucleation of the intact huge cysts is safe. Careful and secured closure of the bronchial communication should be done by purse string or figure-of- 8 sutures, with or without Teflon pledgets. These simple procedures are safe, reliable, and successful...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} study was to review pleural and pericardial complications of patients with hydatid cysts and to analyze the management of therapy for these patients. Methods: Between 1991 and 2001, 43 (29. 7 %) of 145 patients presented with pleural and pericardial complications. These patients had spontaneous pneumothorax (6. 2 %), empyema (7. 6 %), pleural thickening (10. 3 %), hepatopleural fistula (2. 8 %), pericarditis (2. 1 %), and hepatobronchial fistula (0. 7 %). There were 22 male and 21 female patients, {{with a mean age}} of 30 years. Results: The most common symptom was chest pain (79. 1 %). In 37 (86. 1 %) of 43 patients, the cysts were unilateral. The ratio of ruptured cysts was 88. 4 %. In most of the patients, hydatid cysts developed in the right lung (62. 9 %) and the lower lobes of the lung (70. 4 %). Multiple cysts were found in 8 (18. 6 %) patients. The most common surgical techniques were cystotomy with <b>capitonnage</b> (55. 7 %) and decortication (69. 8 %). Radical lung resection was used in 14 % of the patients. The morbidity rate was 16. 3 %, and the mortality rate was 2. 3 %. The mean follow-up was 19 months with no recurrence. Conclusions: Although lung-preserving surgical interventions should be preferred, radical surgical procedures have been used more commonly in patients with pleural complications of hydatid cysts, and the postoperative morbidity rate was higher in these patients. Because of this, the surgical treatment should be carried out before the development of pleural complications. In addition, echinococcosis should be considered and included in the differential diagnosis of spontaneous pneumothorax and empyema. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2002; 123 : 492 -...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Clinical {{approach}} and therapeutic methods {{are important in}} cases with complicated hydatid cysts of the lung. This {{study was designed to}} retrospectively investigate cases with hydatid cysts, thereby discussing diagnostic methods, treatment modalities, and rates of morbidity and mortality in line with the literature. Methods: 176 cases with perforated hydatid cysts, who presented to our clinic and underwent surgery between 2003 and 2011, were included in the study. There were 71 (40. 34 %) females and 105 males (59. 66 %) {{with a mean age of}} 27. 80 ± 14. 07. The most common symptom was dyspnea (44. 31 %) and the most common radiological finding was the water lily sign (21. 02 %). 88. 06 % of the cases were surgically treated by Cystotomy+closure of bronchial opening+ <b>capitonnage,</b> 3. 97 % by wedge resection, 4. 54 % by segmentectomy and 3. 40 % by lobectomy. Results: The cysts exhibited multiple localization in 24 cases (13. 63 %), bilateral localization in 14 cases (7. 95 %), with the most common localization (43. 75 %) being the right lower lobe. While the hydatid cyst rupture occurred due to delivery in three (1. 70 %), trauma in 11 (6. 25 %), and iatrogenic causes in seven (3. 97 %) cases, it occurred spontaneously in the rest of the cases (88. 08 %). Fourteen of the cases with spontaneously occurring rupture (7. 95 %) were detected to have received anthelmintic treatment for hydatid cyst during the preoperative period (albendazole). The rate of morbidity was 27. 27 % and the rate of mortality was 1. 13 % in our study. Two cases recurred during a one-year follow-up (1. 13 %). Conclusion: Hydatid cyst rupture should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cases with pleural effusion, empyema, pneumothorax and pneumonia occurring in endemic regions. Symptoms occurring during and after perforation lead to errors in differential diagnosis. Performing the surgery without delay favorably affects postoperative morbidity and mortality. While parenchyma-preserving surgery is preferential, there is a need for resection in perforated hydatid cysts...|$|E
