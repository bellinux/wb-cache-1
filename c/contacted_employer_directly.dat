40|$|Three {{techniques}} for surveying alumni and alumni's employers were utilized over {{the space of}} 3 academic years, {{for the purpose of}} comparing these methodologies. In the first study, alumni of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville were asked to complete a mailed questionnaire, then were encouraged through a follow-up mailing to grant permission for their <b>employers</b> to be <b>contacted.</b> In the second year, the alumni were asked for their permission for <b>employer</b> <b>contact</b> on the initial survey instrument, and in the third year, alumni were contacted by phone for this permission after they had returned their own questionnaires. Employers were surveyed through the mails in every case, but their instrument was revised in the third year to replace a Likert scale for item responses with a forced-choice format. Comparison of response rates indicates that gaining permission for <b>employer</b> <b>contact</b> <b>directly</b> on a questionnair...|$|R
50|$|Female {{participation}} and mobility {{in the labor}} force are constrained by the socially acceptable behavior of women in Tunisia and even laws. For example, women are discouraged or prohibited by family members from traveling far from home (in both rural and urban environments). Indeed, traveling alone is not an option for a woman or girl. Therefore, given that a job involves commuting, often alone, to the location of work, for women this is socially unacceptable and/or prohibited. Certain Tunisian laws restrict the type of work women participate in, the number of hours they work as well as require a woman’s husband or father to approve of her job and hours worked. The World Bank found that women in Tunisia and the surrounding region (MENA) do not use the same job search methods as men of the same region. Women are significantly less likely to use networking with a friend or <b>contact</b> an <b>employer</b> <b>directly</b> to obtain employment. The World Bank research found that women struggle with finding a suitable working environment because they fear sexual harassment and working long hours. Within the MENA region, the Tunisian government offers the shortest amount of time for maternal leave for women (30 days). Separate maternity leave laws apply to women who work in the public or private industry. Women who work as civil servants or public employees have 60 days of maternity leave while those women who work in the private industry only receive 30 days. In comparison, The Family and Medical Leave Act, in the United States, enables mothers (and fathers) to take up to 6 weeks.|$|R
50|$|In most cases, {{employees}} should {{attempt to}} <b>contact</b> their <b>employer</b> or former employer (or the client of a temporary help agency, if applicable) about the employment standards right(s) they believe have been violated.

50|$|Employees have an {{opportunity}} to tell the ministry on the Claim Form why they did not <b>contact</b> their <b>employer,</b> or that they have already <b>contacted</b> their <b>employer.</b> If the <b>employer</b> <b>contacted</b> the <b>employer</b> but the issue was not resolved, the employee does not have to contact his or her employer again. If the parties are unable to resolve the issue on their own, and if the employee has provided all the required information on the Claim Form, the matter is assigned to an employment standards officer for investigation.|$|R

In the observational study two types of training programs are compared.

A large and positive effect on employment is found from this latter program. In this program it was much easier to get <b>employer</b> <b>contact</b> than in the regular program. From a survey I have information about <b>employer</b> <b>contacts</b> in the two programs.

40|$|The poor {{performance}} often attributed to many public employment services {{may be explained}} {{in part by a}} delegation problem between the central office and local job centers. In markets characterized by frictions, job centers function as match-makers, linking job seekers with relevant vacancies. Because their search intensity in <b>contacting</b> <b>employers</b> and collecting data is not verifiable by the central authority, a typical moral hazard problem can arise. To overcome the delegation problem and provide high-powered incentives for high levels of search {{effort on the part of}} job centers, we propose output-related schemes that assign greater staff capacity to agencies achieving high strike rates. matching unemployment, public employment service, delegation problem, moral hazard, search theory...|$|R

First, since our data contain all information available to employers, we argue that selection on observables is viable.

Our main finding is that women have a 15 percent lower chance than men of getting <b>contacted</b> by <b>employers</b> and that this differential is fully explained by discrimination.

30|$|Men {{and women}} use {{slightly}} different search methods to find jobs. Considering {{the entire sample}} {{of young men and}} women, the vast majority of young people (53.5 %) rely on their network of family and friends. Direct <b>contacts</b> with prospective <b>employers</b> (19.8 %) and answering advertisements (15.0 %) are the second largest methods of job search. This is a sign of the lack of (public) intermediaries in the labor market able to bring vacancy news to unemployed young people.

Similarly, they also tend to find a job through direct <b>contacts</b> with <b>employers.</b> Women found their job more frequently through advertisements and via information gathered at educational institutions.|$|R
