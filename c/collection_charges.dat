The effects on both accounting rates and collection prices are studied. Call-back firms exploit arbitrage opportunities in collection prices among countries, rerouteing calls that originate in countries with high prices for international phone calls via countries with low prices. Contrary {{to what it is}} commonly perceived, we show that call-back tends to magnify the distortions associated with the current accounting rate regime. In particular call-back puts upward pressure both on low price countries foreign accounting rates and <b>collection</b> <b>charges.</b> Call-back companies are assumed to enjoy a price discount on each rerouted call; we show that the larger the price discount offered to call-back companies, the higher the prices for international calls in the country hosting call-back. telecommunications; call-back; access; accounting rate; collection charge; international telephony. ...|$|E
40|$|Muslim {{economists have}} of late shown much {{interest}} in formulating a consumption function for explaining the process of income determination or distribution in an economy regulated by Islamic values and injunctions.

They seek to explain merely the effects of Islamic teachings on the existing secular models and remain, for that reason, firmly anchored in the Keynesian tradition (p. 46). His rejection of Metwally's claim that Islam directs to relate consumption only to current income (not wealth) is valid (p. 47).

40|$|Dar es Salaam is the {{industrial}} and commercial centre of Tanzania. Its population is over 4 million and increasing at 4. 4 % annually due to unplanned urbanization, placing increasing strain on public {{services such as}} solid waste management (SWM). 1992 witnessed government reform and the shift to a market-based economy within Tanzania, and the Earth summit in Rio, after which Dar was named among the UN’s first sustainable city model projects. This paper first reviewed {{the legacy of the}} Sustainable Dar es Salaam Program (SDP) then investigated the actual SWM situation before outlining current challenges from management and governance perspectives. Results show that the rate of waste collection increased after SWM reforms and the commencement of the SDP to around 40 % in 2007. Household and business sentiment agrees that the situation has improved, but perennial management problems persist, such as the lack of an intermediate network of transfer points, and inadequate community support. These are underpinned by ambiguous governance, which results in unclear bylaws related to refuse <b>collection</b> <b>charges</b> (RCCs) and the issuing of only short-term contracts. Thus a set of transparent guidelines related to RCCs are urgently needed along with the legal framework to empower fee collection at grassroots level.

40|$|Abstract: Sustainable urban {{development}} depends on clean water, air and land for {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) disposal. About 61 thousand tons of MSW is generated per day in Turkey. 66 % of the garbage collected is disposed in established municipality dumps. The remaining 24 % is disposed in lakes, sea, rivers, agricultural field or burned in open areas. 10 % of MSW is recycled by the municipalities. In 1996 the municipalities introduced garbage <b>collection</b> <b>charges</b> in the major cities. The decision regarding the correct price is not well established, since the municipalities {{do not have a}} clear account on their expenses regarding the costs of collection, disposal etc. Hence, it is of great importance to identify the relative value the society would be willing to allocate for a better garbage collection service. The objective of this research is to identify the monetary value the households would be willing to allocate for an improved garbage collection service. First, the composition of household solid waste; collection method and the composition of recyclable materials originated from households; and the households ’ evaluation of solid waste collection services are analyzed. Second, the households’ willingness to pay (WTP) to improve solid waste collection service is identified. The assessment of the households WTP for an improved solid waste collection is important while a municipality designs his pricing policy. Although about 97 percent of the households ' garbage are collected daily, only 35. 57 percent revealed that the service is good. The majority declared that the service is fair or good. While assessing the households ' WTP for an improved service, the results showed that 87. 89 percent would not be willing to pay for an improved service. The statistical analysis indicated that people living in apartments and villa type of housing, education and income level effects the choice among the posted price positively. While households located in one-night housing relation to the posted price resulted to be negative. Similar results are found in the logit analysis in which the probability to say "yes " for the posted price is analyzed...|$|E

The charge induced in Silicon Carbide (SiC) -Schottky Barrier Diodes (SBDs) with {{different}} epi-layer thicknesses by ion incidence was measured {{to understand the}} mechanism of heavy-ion-induced anomalous <b>charge</b> <b>collection</b> in SiC-SBDs. SiC SBD of which epitaxial-layer thicknesses is close to ion range show larger anomalous <b>charge</b> <b>collection</b> than SBD with thicker epi-layer although the former one has lower electric field than the later one. The gains of collected charge from the SBDs suggest that the impact ionization under 0. 16 - 0. 18 MV/cm of the static electric field in depletion layer is not dominant mechanisms for the anomalous <b>charge</b> <b>collection.</b> It is suggested that the epitaxial-layer thickness and ion-induced transient high electric field are key to understand the anomalous <b>charge</b> <b>collection</b> mechanisms in SBDs...|$|R
