5|$|Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, {{frequently}} {{given in}} flight, is a metallic and squeaky chyak-chyak or kak-kak. This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as kiaw or kyow. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as kyaay, tchaayk or giaaaa. Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws {{also have a}} hoarse, drawn-out alarm call, arrrrr or kaaaarr, used when warning of predators or when mobbing them. Nestlings begin making a soft <b>cheep</b> at about a week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens. From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise. The European jackdaw can be trained to imitate human speech.|$|E
500|$|The russet sparrow's vocalisations are {{described}} by most sources as [...] "the sweetest and most musical" [...] of any sparrow. Its basic call is a <b>cheep</b> or chilp, {{similar to that}} of other sparrows. This call is monosyllabic, unlike the house sparrow's chirrup call, and is softer than that of the other sparrows. This call is given as a flight call, or by displaying males. Recorded variations include a chweep given by males at the nest and a trilled cheeep. Sometimes the male strings calls together and sings them in a strident tone, to create a sort of short song, transcribed as <b>cheep</b> chirrup cheeweep or chreet-chreet-chreet. The song is interspersed with sibilant chu-swik notes {{similar to those of the}} white wagtail. A thin swee swee vocalisation not unlike that of an Indian robin has been reported, but the context of this call is unrecorded. During territorial disputes, males give a rapid chit-chit-chit call.|$|E
500|$|The female corn crake {{may give}} {{a call that}} {{is similar to that of}} the male; it also has a {{distinctive}} barking sound, similar in rhythm to the main call but without the grating quality. The female also has a high-pitched <b>cheep</b> call, and a oo-oo-oo sound to call the chick. The chicks make a quiet peeick-peeick contact call, and a chirp used to beg for food. Because of the difficulty in seeing this species, it is usually censused by counting males calling between 11pm and 3am; the birds do not move much at night, whereas they may wander up to [...] during the day, which could lead to double-counting if monitored then. Identifying individual males suggests that just counting calling birds underestimates the true count by nearly 30%, and the discrepancy is likely to be greater, since only 80% of males may call at all on a given night. The corn crake is silent in Africa.|$|E

500|$|Like other rails, {{this species}} {{has a wide}} range of vocalisations. The male's {{territorial}} and advertising call is a series of rapid grating krrr notes repeated {{two or three times a}} second for several minutes. It is given most often in the breeding season, usually early or late in the day, but sometimes continues after dark or starts before dawn. The male stands upright with his neck extended when advertising, but will also call when chasing intruders on the ground or in flight. Both sexes give a sharp, loud kip call as an alarm or during territorial interactions, adapting a similar pose as for the advertising call. Once breeding starts, the birds become much quieter, but territorial birds commence the kip call again during the non-breeding season, especially when there is a high density of African crakes in the area. A wheezy kraaa is associated with threat displays and copulation; imitation of this call by a human can bring a rail to within [...] Newly hatched chicks make a soft wheeeez call, and older chicks <b>cheep.</b>|$|E
2500|$|John Maria and Rocco Gatti {{took over}} {{management}} of the Vaudeville in 1905. [...] In 1906, the theatre hosted the very successful The Belle of Mayfair, a musical composed by Leslie Stuart with a book by Basil Hood, Charles Brookfield and Cosmo Hamilton, produced by Hicks' partner, Charles Frohman. It ran for 431 performances and starred Edna May, Louie and her brother Courtice Pounds, and Camille Clifford. In 1910, an English adaptation of The Girl in the Train (Die geschiedene Frau – literally, [...] "The Divorcee"), a 1908 Viennese operetta by Leo Fall, opened at the Vaudeville. It was produced by George Edwardes, with lyrics by Adrian Ross and starred Robert Evett, Phyllis Dare and Rutland Barrington. In 1911, William Greet produced Baby Mine at the theatre. Betty Bolton made her debut in 1916, {{at the age of}} 10, in a revue called Some, at the theatre. During and after World War I, audiences sought light entertainment, and musical revues held the Vaudeville stage, including <b>Cheep</b> (1917), the long-running Just Fancy (1920) and Rats (1923), another popular revue. Albert Ketèlbey was one of the theatre's music directors.|$|E

50|$|Cockatiels {{do have a}} {{reputation}} for demanding attention of their owners on a regular basis. Their vocalizations range from soft <b>cheeps</b> to piercing cries, but they lack the screeching voice of other parrots; males are, however, louder than females. A cockatiel permitted to roam freely will often seek out its owner, following him or her from room to room; or if the owner happens to be outdoors, going from window to window to keep the owner in sight.|$|R

60|$|Van Cheele agreed, but he privately doubted {{whether they}} were being grafted on to a nice {{suitable}} child.

60|$|One autumn {{day there}} fluttered {{on to the}} Cathedral roof a slender, sweet-voiced bird that had wandered away from the bare fields and {{thinning}} hedgerows {{in search of a}} winter roosting-place. It tried to rest its tired feet under the shade of a great angel-wing or to nestle in the sculptured folds of a kingly robe, but the fat pigeons hustled it away from wherever it settled, and the noisy sparrow-folk drove it off the ledges. No respectable bird sang with so much feeling, they <b>cheeped</b> one to another, and the wanderer had to move on.|$|R
6000|$|The spot {{chosen by}} the ill-fated Stuart and his gallant remnant for their last desperate {{enterprise}} was eminently fitted for their purpose. Being round the corner from Thrums, it was commanded by no fortified place save the farm of Nether Drumgley, and on a recent goustie night nearly all the trees had been blown down, making a hundred hiding-places for bold climbers, and transforming the Den into a scene of wild and mournful grandeur. In no bay more suitable than the flooded field called the Silent Pool could the hunted prince have cast anchor, for the Pool is not only sheltered from observation, but so little troubled by gales that it had only one drawback: at some seasons of the year it was not there. This, however, did not vex Stroke, as it is cannier to call him, for he burned his boats on the night he landed (and a dagont, tedious job it was too), and pointed out to his followers that the drouth which kept him in must also keep the enemy out. Part {{of the way to}} the lair they usually traversed in the burn, because water leaves no trace, and though they carried turnip lanterns and were armed to the teeth, this was often a perilous journey owing to the lovers close at hand on the pink path, from which the trees had been cleared, for lads and lasses must walk whate'er betide. Ronny-On's Jean and Peter Scrymgeour, little Lisbeth Doak and long Sam'l from Pyotdykes were pairing that year, and never knew how near they were to being dirked by Corp of Corp, who, lurking in the burn till there were no tibbits in his toes, muttered fiercely, [...] "Cheep one single <b>cheep,</b> and it will be thy hinmost, methinks!" [...] under the impression that Methinks was a Jacobite oath.|$|E

[...] Languidly clung about by the half-fallen shawl, and with folded [...] Hands, that held a few sad asters: [...] "I sigh for this idyl [...] Lived at last to an end; and, looking on to my prose-life," [...] With a smile, she said, and a subtle derision of manner, [...] "Better and better I seem, when I recollect all that has happened [...] Since I came here in June: the walks we have taken together [...] Through these darling meadows, and dear, old, desolate woodlands; [...] All our afternoon readings, and all our strolls through the moonlit [...] Village,--so sweetly asleep, one scarcely could credit the scandal, [...] Heartache, and trouble, and spite, that were hushed for the night, [...] in its silence. [...] Yes, I am better. I think I could even be civil to him for his [...] kindness, [...] Letting me come here without him.... But open the gate, Cousin [...] Clement; [...] Seems to me it grows chill, and I think it is healthier in-doors. [...] --No, then I you need not speak, for I know well enough what is [...] coming: [...] Bitter taunts for the past, and discouraging views of the future? [...] Tragedy, Cousin Clement, or comedy,--just as you like it;-- [...] Only not here alone, but somewhere that people can see you. [...] Then I'll take part in the play, and appear the remorseful young [...] person [...] Full of divine regrets at not having smothered a genius [...] Under the feathers and silks of a foolish, extravagant woman. [...] O you selfish boy! what was it, just now, about anguish? [...] Bills would be your talk, Cousin Clement, if you were my husband." [...] Then, with her summer-night glory of eyes low-bending upon him, [...] Dark'ning his thoughts as the pondered stars bewilder and darken, [...] Tenderly, wistfully drooping toward him, she faltered in whisper,-- [...] All her mocking face transfigured,--with mournful effusion: [...] "Clement, do not think it is you alone that remember,-- [...] Do not think it is you alone that have suffered. Ambition, [...] Fame, and your art,--you have all these things to console you. [...] I--what have I in this world? Since my child is dead--a bereavement." [...] Sad hung her eyes on his, and he felt all the anger within him [...] Broken, and melting in tears. But he shrank from her touch while he [...] answered [...] (Awkwardly, being a man, and awkwardly, being a lover), [...] "Yes, {{you know how it is}} done. You have cleverly fooled me [...] beforetime, [...] With a dainty scorn, and then an imploring forgiveness! [...] Yes, you might play it, I think,--that rôle of remorseful young [...] person, [...] That, or the old man's darling, or anything else you attempted.

[...] There he tore from its stalk the imperial flower of the thistle, [...] Tore, and gave to her, who took it with mocking obeisance, [...] Twined it in her hair, and said, with her subtle derision: [...] "You are a wiser man than I thought you could ever be, Clement,-- [...] Sensible, almost. So! I'll try to forget and remember." [...] Lightly she took his arm, but on through the lane to the farm-house, [...] Mutely together they moved through the lonesome, odorous twilight.|$|E

500|$|The {{advertising}} {{calls of}} both crakes are readily {{distinguished from the}} quite dissimilar calls of potentially sympatric rails such as the spotted crake, striped crake, Baillon's crake, or water rail.

40|$|Rhode Island Red chicks were hatched {{either in}} {{isolation}} or in pairs. On {{the second day}} after hatching they were injected with either 0, 0. 5, 1. 5, 4. 5, or 13. 5 mg of testosterone. Two days later their emotional response to a novel environment was determined by counting the cheeping rate. It was found that, while low doses of testosterone elevated cheeping, the highest doses caused a depression back to, or below, control levels. The rearing environment also had an effect in that the isolated chicks <b>cheeped</b> more than their social counterparts for every dose except the 0. 5 -mg dose. It was concluded that testosterone can influence behavioral arousal in chicks but that the effect is dependent upon both dose and previous environmental experience...|$|R
50|$|When {{there are}} {{multiple}} offspring in a single brood, the potential for sibling rivalry arises due to competition for food and parental attention. Natural selection may favor behaviors that allow an individual offspring to gain more resources, even if the behavior decreases a sibling's fitness. Competition for food and resources {{can be seen in}} many bird species. For example, blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii) siblings often exhibit aggression towards each other, with older chicks pecking at younger chicks. This behavior increases when there are food shortages, indicating more intense competition. In other bird species, siblings compete for food through manipulation of parental behavior rather than direct aggressive acts. Increased parental attention may mean more food for the offspring, favoring the development of begging behavior in nestlings. American robin (Turdus migratorius) chicks compete for food provided by their parents through louder and more prominent <b>cheeps</b> or other vocalizations, with the most food given to chicks exhibiting the most intense begging behavior.|$|R
