40|$|Loss of Signal (LOS) Detection {{description}} The TLK 2701 is {{a member}} of the transceiver family of multigigabit transceivers, intended for use in ultrahigh-speed bidirectional point-to-point data transmission systems. The TLK 2701 supports an effective serial interface speed of 1. 6 Gbps to 2. 7 Gbps, providing up to 2. 16 Gbps of data bandwidth. The primary application of this chip is to provide very high-speed I/O data channels for point-to-point baseband data transmission over controlled impedance media of approximately 50 Ω. The transmission media can be printed-circuit board, copper cables, or fiber-optic cable. The maximum rate and distance of data transfer is dependent upon the attenuation characteristics of the media and the noise coupling to the environment. This device can also be used to replace parallel data transmission architectures by providing a reduction in the number of traces, <b>connector</b> <b>terminals,</b> and transmit/receive terminals. Parallel data loaded into the transmitter is delivered to the receiver over a serial channel, which can be a coaxial copper cable, a controlled impedance backplane, or an optical link. It is then reconstructed into its original parallel format. It offers significant power and cost savings over current solutions, as well as scalability for higher data rate in the future. The TLK 2701 performs data conversion parallel-to-serial and serial-to-parallel. The clock extraction function...|$|R

40|$|In {{electrical}} engineering <b>terminal</b> <b>connectors</b> {{are commonly used}} for connecting and releasing electrical conductors. They are sophisticated mass products sufficient for high- and low power transmission or transmitting information. There are various applications for wiring in cars, control- or house installations and electrical power supply systems. Depending on the electrical current to be transmitted and consequently the wire diameter there are several approaches to realize a durable and safe mechanical connection between the conductors. The electrical contact resistance of such systems {{is defined by the}} constriction- and the film resistance. The constriction resistance heavily depends on the contact or load force. If the connection becomes loose, this force decreases or even disappears, which results in an extensive raise of the temperature in the contact area. The current density is locally increasing on certain connection points. The raised temperature may lead to unwanted operational states or even fire. There are a few mechanical solutions to realize a constant or re-adjusting contact force. However, these approaches are mechanically complex and hence cost intensive. In this paper we present the development and experimental investigation of a self-adjusting <b>terminal</b> <b>connector</b> based on shape-memory alloys (SMA) which is far less complex than currently known mechanical solutions. The compensation of the decreasing contact force is realized by a precompressed SMA cylinder, which is located in a drill hole {{at the bottom of the}} <b>terminal</b> <b>connector’s</b> screw. Under normal conditions the terminal works similar to a conventional screw connector. In case of decreasing contact forces, the increasing contact resistance results in a rising temperature. As soon as the austenite start temperature is reached the SMA cylinder starts to expand and resets the contact force. As a result the system cools down and the SMA cylinder keeps a desired contact force. In this paper we present the general design of such a system and ist limitations. Measurement data of the SMA cylinder and the active <b>terminal</b> <b>connector</b> will further show the proof of the concept...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{vibration}} of contacts is the main cause of contact degradation by the so called fretting corrosion phenomena. In fact the oxidation process of particles generated by mechanical wear produce the increase of contact resistance frequently reported in the literature. The main objective of this work is to examine conjointly the wear amount and electrical behaviour of <b>connector</b> <b>terminals</b> under vibration stress. The spring lamellas of an automotive connector are submitted to high number of vibration (103 to 107 cycles) whereas the pin is firmly attached to a fixed support. High frequency (100 Hz) and low frequency (1 Hz) oscillation with two amplitudes of 50 ?m and 250 ?m are used. The contact is made with copper alloy and coated with 2 ?m of thickness and made in tin, silver or gold. The contact resistance is measured with a current source (Im = 1 mA) with a voltage limit of Vcc of 20 mV. Furthermore a new technique for characterising the subsequent wear is carried out. So, the dimensions of the resultant wear track are evaluated by profilometer (10 nm of resolution) while the removed mass in the track are evaluated by weight (± 1 ?g). The main results show that a low level of wear observed during the earlier stage of fretting may corresponds to the neglected contact resistance increase. However after this initiating period the coating is removed and as contact resistance increased the wear takes place in the substrate. Finally the effects of motion parameters, test duration and different coatings were studied...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{lead free}} {{connector}} products involves {{at least two}} distinct steps: removing the lead from the product and ensuring the product has sufficient thermal stability. Lead is most commonly found in terminal finishes and {{has been removed from}} most thermoplastic materials used in connectors. Ensuring sufficient thermal stability requires knowledge of the thermal excursions involved in soldering and how these excursions translate into product performance metrics. For reflow soldering, we know the maximum soldering temperatures will increase by 20 to 30 C. The magnitude of this change is not large, however, the temperature value, 260 C, exceeds the melt point of many engineering thermoplastics. Since the cost of these plastics typically scales with melt temperature, an increase in thermal requirements can mean a significant cost increase. In this paper we strive to understand the fundamental response of the plastics to the transient thermal excursions involved in wave soldering. FEM simulations demonstrate the thermal gradients that exist during these processes. These results can be used to understand the heat transfer and then to engineer the products to ensure reliability. Wave solder process simulation shows that the pin to plastic interface resides at a temperature very near to that of the solder. <b>Connector</b> <b>terminals,</b> made from copper based alloys, often have very high thermal diffusivities, increasing heat flow from the solder pot into the plastic. FEM results are compared to experimental results from lab and production manufactured testing of solderable interconnects.
