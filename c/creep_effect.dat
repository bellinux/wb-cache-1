40|$|Piezoelectric {{actuators}} exhibit creep {{behavior in}} open-loop operation, which {{may lead to}} unaffordable errors in high precision static positioning systems. An inversion-based compensation strategy by open-loop control is presented for reducing <b>creep</b> <b>effect.</b> The approach utilizes a nonlinear viscoelastic model to portray creep phenomenon, which consists of a linear spring, a nonlinear dashpot {{and a series of}} nonlinear Voigt elements. It is shown that for the presented creep model the step responses are very similar to the piezoelectric actuators. In order to compensate <b>creep</b> <b>effect,</b> a concept of voltage relaxation in piezoelectric actuators is proposed. And the voltage relaxation model tantamount to the inverse creep model is derived using a PID closed-loop control system. Experimental results prove that, by insertion of voltage relaxation model in open-loop operation, <b>creep</b> <b>effect</b> is attenuated markedly in piezoelectric actuators...|$|E

40|$|Springer-Verlag London Limited 2009 The {{adaptive}} {{identification of}} the non-linear hysteresis and <b>creep</b> <b>effects</b> in a piezoelectric actuator is proposed in this paper. Model uncertainties related to the hysteresis and <b>creep</b> <b>effects,</b> most prominently in the high frequency zone (to 100 Hz), large operating amplitude and/long operating time, can make a piezoelectric actuator-driven micro-positioning system unstable in the closed loop. Furthermore, these uncertainties may lead to inaccurate open-loop control and frequently cause harmonic distortion when a piezoelectric actuator is driven with a sinusoidal input voltage signal. In order to solve the above issues, {{it is important to}} determine an accurate non-linear dynamic model of a piezoelectric actuator. An unscented Kalman filter-based adaptive identification algorithm is presented, which accurately determines the non-linear dynamics of a piezoelectric stack type actuator such that the non-linear hysteresis and <b>creep</b> <b>effects</b> can be accurately predicted. Since hysteresis and creep are dominant in open loop, the actuator is driven in an open-loop mode in this investigation. J. Minase, T. -F. Lu, B. Cazzolato and S. Grainge...|$|R

40|$|A {{modified}} log-type creep model without hysteresis of {{the stack}} piezoelectric actuator is presented. For high-speed micro-/nanopositioning system, the time scale should be less than one second for creep modeling and control in the stack piezoelectric actuator.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a Finite Element Modelling (FEM) {{approach}} is proposed for modelling the visco-plastic <b>creep</b> <b>effects</b> that a PTFE-faced thrust bearing would undergo during normal operating conditions. A thermal elastic hydrodynamic lubrication (TEHL) model is developed, which uses the Reynolds equations for a fluid film, coupled with Hertzian contact {{theory and the}} energy equation to predict the pressure and film thickness on the PTFE face {{as well as the}} temperature and thickness of the fluid. These variables are then used with a Norton creep function to predict the secondary <b>creep</b> <b>effects</b> on the PTFE surface. This change in PTFE thickness due to visco-plastic effects are taken into account within the film thickness equations and the effects over a bearing’s operational life span studied. The Norton creep function is obtained from experimental creep results conducted on filled PTFE samples at the University of Leeds. This experimental method allowed for the displacement of the samples to be recorded over a 7 day test period at a representative range of pressure and temperature conditions and a Norton creep function to be obtained from the results. The Norton creep function was then included within the simulations to allow for the visco-plastic <b>creep</b> <b>effects</b> to be studied. Results obtained showed that whilst the secondary creep had a small effect on the pressure profile of the pad, the peak pressure was significantly affected during the duration of the pads operational life. It was concluded that this was due to the pad deformation changing, meaning a smaller peak pressure was observed, but the tilt angle did not change greatly, meaning the profile did not change. The pad and film thickness also changed as time passed, with the pad getting thinner in areas of high pressure and temperature, due to the secondary <b>creep</b> <b>effects.</b> It was also observed that the peak temperature of the pad also decreased as time passed, due to the film thickness increase in areas of high temperature. ...|$|R
40|$|Fluid {{flow and}} heat {{transfer}} {{in the entrance}} region of rectangular microchannels of various aspect ratios, 0. 2 ≤ α * ≤ 1, are numerically investigated in the slip flow regime, 10 - 3 ≤ Kn ≤ 10 - 1, with {{particular attention to the}} thermal <b>creep</b> <b>effects.</b> Uniform inlet velocity and temperature profiles are prescribed in a microchannel with constant wall temperature. The gas inlet temperature is prescribed higher than the wall temperature in order to study the thermal <b>creep</b> <b>effects</b> in a fluid cooling process. To avoid unrealistically large axial temperature gradients due to the prescribed uniform inlet temperature and upstream conduction associated with low Reynolds number flows encountered in microchannels, an adiabatic section is added to the inlet of the channel, which resembles an adiabatic reservoir. A control volume technique is employed to solve the Navier-Stokes and energy equations which are accompanied with appropriate velocity-slip and temperature-jump boundary conditions at walls. Despite the constant wall temperature, axial and peripheral temperature gradients form in the gas layer adjacent to the wall due to temperature-jump. The simultaneous effects of velocity-slip, temperature-jump and thermal creep on the flow and thermal patterns along with the key flow parameters are examined in detail {{for a wide range of}} cross sectional aspect ratios, and Knudsen and Reynolds numbers (0. 1 ≤ Re ≤ 5).

However, under certain conditions, the unloading behaviour can be viscoelastic, and if the viscosity effects are not corrected, the calculated modulus can be seriously erroneous. Feng and Ngan have proposed a correction formula which can eliminate the <b>creep</b> <b>effects.</b> However, this formula has been proven to be correct for the case of linear viscoelasticity only; the general case of power-law viscoelasticity has not been proven. In this paper, this formula is proved for the general power-law viscoelastic situation using a Maxwell material model. Finite-element calculations are also performed to illustrate the result.
