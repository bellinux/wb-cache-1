25|$|Prominent Guyanese {{scholar and}} {{political}} activist Walter Rodney wrote {{at length about}} the economic exploitation of Africa by the colonial powers. In particular, he saw labourers as an especially abused group. While a capitalist system almost always employs some form of wage labour, the dynamic between labourers and colonial powers left the way open for extreme misconduct. According the Rodney, African workers were more exploited than Europeans because the colonial system produced a <b>complete</b> <b>monopoly</b> on political power and left the working class small and incapable of collective action. Combined with deep-seated racism, native workers were presented with impossible circumstances. The racism and superiority felt by the colonizers enabled them to justify the systematic underpayment of Africans {{even when they were}} working alongside European workers. Colonialists further defended their disparate incomes by claiming a higher cost of living. Rodney challenged this pretext and asserted the European quality of life and cost of living were only possible because of the exploitation of the colonies and African living standards were intentionally depressed in order to maximize revenue. In its wake, colonialism left Africa vastly underdeveloped and without a path forward.|$|E

50|$|By {{the final}} {{decade of the}} 19th century, John Boyd Dunlop’s 1887 {{invention}} of inflatable, rubber bicycle tubes and {{the growing popularity of}} the automobile dramatically increased global demand for rubber. To monopolize the resources of the entire Congo Free State, Leopold issued three decrees in 1891 and 1892 that reduced the native population to serfs. Collectively, these forced the natives to deliver all ivory and rubber, harvested or found, to state officers thus nearly <b>completing</b> Leopold's <b>monopoly</b> of the ivory and rubber trade. The rubber came from wild vines in the jungle, unlike the rubber from Brazil (Hevea brasiliensis), which was tapped from trees. To extract the rubber, instead of tapping the vines, the Congolese workers would slash them and lather their bodies with the rubber latex. When the latex hardened, it would be scraped off the skin in a painful manner, as it took off the worker's hair with it.|$|R

40|$|Ropalidia marginata, {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} a primitively eusocial wasp species appears to have acquired some features reminiscent of highly eusocial species. Queens are behaviorally passive individuals, yet maintain <b>complete</b> reproductive <b>monopoly</b> and probably use pheromones to achieve this. Regulation of worker foraging is achieved by the workers themselves in a decentralized, self-organized manner. If there are other species in the genus Ropalidia that do not show such relatively 'advanced' features, this genus can provide an attractive model system to investigate the evolutionary transition from the primitively eusocial to the highly eusocial state. Here, we therefore investigate the congeneric Ropalidia cyathiformis and demonstrate that in contrast to R. marginata, {{it appears to be}} a typical primitively eusocial species. As expected therefore, and in striking contrast with R. marginata, R. cyathiformis queens are the most, or among the most, dominant, active and interactive individuals and their behavior is consistent with the possibility that they suppress worker reproduction and regulate worker foraging in a relatively centralized manner. Upon removal of the queen, a potential queen with levels of aggression even higher than that of the queen, becomes apparent immediately. Such a potential queen appears to take over inhibition of worker reproduction and regulation of worker foraging by mechanisms similar to that used by the queen so that, there is no disruption in foraging and brood care...|$|R

Des Groseilliers accompanied Captain Zachariah Gillam on the ketch Nonsuch and they jointly founded the first fur-trading post on James Bay, Charles Fort.

40|$|Colonies of the primitively eusocial wasp Ropalidia marginata {{consist of}} a single egg layer (queen) {{and a number of}} non-egg-laying workers.

The PQ is almost never challenged because she first becomes hyperaggressive and then gradually loses her aggression, develops her ovaries, and starts laying eggs. Although we are unable to identify the PQ when the queen is present, she appears to be a ``cryptic heir designate. '' Here, we show that there is not just one heir designate but a long reproductive queue and that PQs take over the role of egg-laying, successively, without overt conflict, as the queen or previous PQs are removed. The dominance rank of an individual is not a significant predictor of its position in the succession hierarchy. The age of an individual is a significant predictor, but it is not a perfect predictor because PQs often bypass older individuals to become successors. We suggest that such a predesignated reproductive queue that is implemented without overt conflict is adaptive in the tropics, where conspecific usurpers from outside the colony, which can take advantage of the anarchy prevailing in a queenless colony and invade it, are likely to be present throughout the year...|$|R
