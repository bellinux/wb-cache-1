50|$|On May 25, {{before the}} start of <b>canvassing,</b> Didagen Dilangalen, lawyer of Bongbong Marcos, {{requested}} for separate <b>canvassing</b> of presidential and vice presidential results. This motion was made for an early proclamation of presumptive president Rodrigo Duterte and for more thorough examination of the tight vice presidential race. The joint committee rejected his motion and proceeded on <b>canvassing</b> on a per certificate of <b>canvass</b> (COC) basis. Davao del Sur's COC was first <b>canvassed.</b> Discrepancies of COCs of Davao del Norte, Ilocos Sur and Laguna were found and their results were deferred. The Provincial Board of Canvassers of these provinces were summoned to address these issues. The committee have admitted for <b>canvassing</b> a total of 45 COCs from 20 provinces, 15 cities, 1 district and 9 countries.|$|R

25|$|In 1983, {{opposition}} leader Benigno Aquino, Jr. was assassinated at the Manila International Airport {{upon his return}} to the Philippines after a long period of exile. This coalesced popular dissatisfaction with Marcos and began a succession of events, including pressure from the United States, that culminated in a snap presidential election in February 1986. The opposition united under Aquino's widow, Corazon Aquino. The official election <b>canvasser,</b> the Commission on Elections (Comelec), declared Marcos the winner of the election. However, there was a large discrepancy between the Comelec results and that of Namfrel, an accredited poll watcher. The allegedly fraudulent result was rejected by Corazon Aquino and her supporters. International observers, including a U.S. delegation, denounced the official results. General Fidel Ramos and Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile withdrew their support for Marcos. A peaceful civilian-military uprising, now popularly called the People Power Revolution, forced Marcos into exile and installed Corazon Aquino as president on February 25, 1986.|$|E

500|$|Since {{the end of}} the War of 1812, the Oregon Country was {{claimed by}} both Britain and the United States, but neither side pressed their claim. Floyd wanted to pursue America's {{interests}} there more aggressively and so on December 20, 1820, he brought this question, the first person to do so, to the attention of Congress with a resolution to appoint a committee and [...] "inquire into the situation of the settlements upon the Pacific Ocean and the expediency of occupying the Columbia River." [...] The resolution passed and the committee was formed with Floyd as the chairman, and Thomas Metcalfe of Kentucky and Thomas Van Swearingen of Virginia as members. Floyd presented the committee's report on January 21, 1821, along with a bill to authorize the occupation of the Columbia River area. Nothing happened with the bill, and John Quincy Adams criticized Floyd and characterized him as [...] "a 'flaunting' <b>canvasser</b> and a politician seeking to win prestige and patronage, particularly the latter, by a vigorous opposition to the party in power" [...] and attributed his motives for occupation by [...] "a desire to provide a retreat for a defaulting relative and possibly for himself." [...] Floyd then brought forth a resolution on December 10, 1821, to inquire into the expediency of occupying the area, and a week later presented another resolution to have the Secretary of the Navy give an estimate for a survey of harbors on the Pacific Coast.|$|E

During this time, he dyed his hair red and would often cultivate a pencil mustache, after Salvador Dalí. In 1980, he got licensed to sell mutual funds and stocks and began working as a Wall Street commodities broker at First Investors Corporation. After a summer with his parents in Sarasota, Florida (Koons took on a brief job there as a political <b>canvasser),</b> he returned to New York and found a new career as a commodities broker, first at Clayton Brokerage Company and then at Smith Barney. He did this job when he encountered the problem of financing his first series, but also {{in order to be}} independent from the art market: [...] "I could make exactly what art I wanted to make.

50|$|Beginning in the Elizabethan era, and {{expanding}} during the conflicts under the Stuarts, elections {{began to be}} openly contested. <b>Canvassing</b> was a controversial strategy. In both 1604 and 1626 <b>canvassing</b> for votes was banned. It {{was seen as a}} violation to free elections, as votes would be won by persuasion rather than a voter making up his own mind. Despite this, by the late 17th century, <b>canvassing</b> was standard practice in English elections. Rival campaigns would attempt a full <b>canvass</b> of all voters, which even in the largest districts would only be a few thousand people.|$|R

60|$|Most {{of us will}} be canvassed soon, I suppose; some of us {{may even}} canvass. Upon which side, of course, nothing will induce me to state, beyond saying that by a {{remarkable}} coincidence it will in every case be the only side in which a high-minded, public-spirited, and patriotic citizen can take even a momentary interest. But the general question of canvassing itself, being a non-party question, is one which we may be permitted to approach. The rules for canvassers are fairly familiar to any one who has ever canvassed. They are printed on the little card which you carry about with you and lose. There is a statement, I think, that you must not offer a voter food or drink. However hospitable you may feel towards him in his own house, you must not carry his lunch about with you. You must not produce a veal cutlet from your tail-coat pocket. You must not conceal poached eggs about your person. You must not, like a kind of conjurer, produce baked potatoes from your hat. In short, the <b>canvasser</b> must not feed the voter in any way. Whether the voter is allowed to feed the <b>canvasser,</b> whether the voter may give the <b>canvasser</b> veal cutlets and baked potatoes, is a point of law on which I {{have never been able to}} inform myself. When I found myself canvassing a gentleman, I have sometimes felt tempted to ask him if there was any rule against his giving me food and drink; but the matter seemed a delicate one to approach. His attitude to me also sometimes suggested a doubt as to whether he would, even if he could. But there are voters who might find it worth while to discover if there is any law against bribing a <b>canvasser.</b> They might bribe him to go away.|$|E
