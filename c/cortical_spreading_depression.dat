40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to determine the}} role of serum magnesium in the pathophysiology after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and to assess the effect of magnesium treatment in reducing cerebral ischemia in experimental SAH and in improving clinical outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH. In Chapter 2 we reviewed the potentials of magnesium treatment in subarachnoid hemorrhage by describing the pathophysiology of ischemia after SAH and the many ways magnesium may interfere with this. In Chapter 3 we described a study in which <b>cortical</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>depressions</b> (CSDs) are induced by topical administration of potassium chloride in rat brain. We demonstrated that intravenous magnesium administration reduced CSDs and delayed anoxic depolarization in intact rat brain. Therefore we hypothesized that the neuroprotective role of magnesium in cerebral ischemia is partly due to effective suppression of ischemia-induced depolarization. In Chapter 4 we induced an experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage in the rat by means of the endovascular filament model. MRI measurements were performed on a 4. 7 T NMR spectrometer 1 and 48 hours after SAH and 9 days thereafter. We showed that it is feasible to detect alterations of in-vivo vessel diameter and blood flow velocities and their consequences for brain damage after experimental SAH in the rat. The increase of the infarct and the concomitant vasoconstriction suggest that delayed cerebral ischemia after SAH occurs in rats and that vasoconstriction may play an important role. In the study described in Chapter 5 we also used the endovascular filament method to induce SAH in the rat. Extracellular direct current potentials were continuously recorded from 6 Ag/AgCl electrodes, before and up to 90 minutes following SAH. Next, animals were transferred to the 4. 7 T NMR spectrometer. We demonstrated that prolonged depolarizations occur immediately after SAH and that the duration of these depolarizations is related to the extent of ischemic lesions observed on MRI. Moreover, we found that pretreatment with magnesium sulfate reduces the duration of the depolarizations and the extent of the ischemic lesions. <b>Cortical</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>depressions</b> play a minor role, if any, in the acute pathophysiology of SAH.

50|$|Amiloride is {{an example}} of an ASIC inhibitor, while not {{considered}} highly potent due to an IC50 value in the micromolar range, has allowed for studies on ASIC inhibition effects on migraines. During a migraine, <b>cortical</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>depression</b> is observed which causes ion imbalances and the release of charged molecules which may activate ASIC. Testing of amiloride in rodents, showed a decrease in the <b>cortical</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>depression</b> during a migraine. Studies showed that amiloride acts as a competitive inhibitor of the ASIC chapters. The use of amiloride also showed side effects in rodents due to inhibition of sodium/ calcium exchangers. The inhibition of these exchangers disrupts cellular calcium homeostasis and causes high levels of calcium in the cell which explains the reduced neuroprotective efficacy with the use of amiloride. The findings that have come through due to ASIC inhibition by amiloride are promising and support the therapeutic potential. However, due to amiloride's lack of specificity and potency, further drug development on its structure will need to be done before a drug can be released.|$|E

40|$|A nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance study of the middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat is presented. Experiments were performed on seven animals before and after occlusion, which occurred in situ. The emphasis {{in this study was}} on evaluating rapid proton spectroscopic imaging. Data were acquired with experimental durations of between 4 and 15 minutes for a 32 by 32 spatial matrix, with 64 spectroscopic data points per spatial element. The spectroscopic data were interleaved with diffusion-weighted nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} water images of the same slice. The study was terminated at about 6 hours after occlusion. The brains were then frozen in liquid nitrogen for biochemical imaging. The results showed that the signal from N-acetyl aspartate decreased and that of lactate increased within the infarcted region. The temporal course of these intensity changes varied between animals. Nineteen <b>cortical</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>depressions</b> (CSD) were observed by electrophysiologic monitoring during the experiments.

40|$|The {{studies in}} this thesis {{research}} were conducted to investigate if sensitivity to induced <b>cortical</b> <b>spread</b> <b>depression</b> (CSD) or the consequence of a CSD event is affected by sumatriptan induced latent sensitization. Previous studies in our lab showed persistent exposure of sumatripan to rats produced a latent state of sensitization. Using persistent sumatripan exposed rats {{as a model for}} medication overuse headache, behavior, electrical stimulation threshold to provoke a CSD event and the immunoreactivity of c-Fos in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) were characterized. Current results showed no statistical difference of electrically induced CSD thresholds in anesthetized rats measured at day 20 in sumatripan exposed rats compared with saline treated rats. Topiramate (80 mg/kg, i. p.) used clinically for prophylaxis of migraine headache significantly increased CSD threshold in both saline and sumatriptan infused rats. CSD events appear to be associated with trigeminal vascular system activation in TNC because c-Fos expression significantly enhanced in rats with electrically stimulated CSD events. As compared to saline treated rats, sumatriptan-exposed rats demonstrated a significantly higher number of c-Fos positive cells following the electrically stimulated CSD event. Under environmental stress (bright light), sumatripan exposed rats demonstrated decreased response thresholds to periorbital and hindpaw tactile stimuli (i. e., allodynia) and enhanced c-Fos expression in TNC. A single dose of topiramate (80 mg/kg, i. p.) reversed environmental stress induced allodynia and c-Fos over-activity. Taken together, these results suggest that latent sensitization induced by persistent sumatripan exposure seems not correlated to the threshold of electrically stimulated CSD in current model. However, CSD enhanced the responses of trigeminal system in rats with sumatriptan-induced latent sensitization. The protective effects of topiramate shown in this model may be related to blocking the initiation of CSD events resulting from environmental stimulation as well as inhibiting the consequences of CSD events in primary afferents. These findings correlate with clinical observations of protective effects of topiramate for migraine prophylaxis...|$|R

40|$|OBJECT: Ischemia-induced tissue depolarizations {{probably}} play {{an important}} role in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia caused by parent vessel occlusion. Their role in ischemia caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains to be investigated. The authors determined whether ischemic depolarizations (IDs) or <b>cortical</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>depressions</b> (CSDs) occur after SAH, and how these relate to the extent of tissue injury measured on magnetic resonance (MR) images. In addition, they assessed whether administration of MgSO 4 reduces depolarization time and lesion volume. METHODS: By means of the endovascular suture model, experimental SAH was induced in 52 rats, of which 37 were appropriate for analysis, including four animals that underwent sham operations. Before induction of SAH, serum Mg++ levels were measured and 90 mg/kg intravascular MgSO 4 or saline was given. Extracellular direct current potentials were continuously recorded from six Ag/AgCl electrodes, before and up to 90 minutes following SAH, after which serum Mg++ levels were again measured. Next, animals were transferred to the MR imaging magnet for diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging. Depolarization times per electrode were averaged to determine a mean depolarization time per animal. No depolarizations occurred in sham-operated animals. Ischemic depolarizations occurred at all electrodes in all animals after SAH. Only two animals displayed a single spreading depression-like depolarization. The mean duration of the ID time was 41 +/- 25 minutes in the saline-treated controls and 31 +/- 30 minutes in the Mg++-treated animals (difference 10 minutes: p = 0. 31). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of tissue H 2 O, obtained using DW images approximately 2. 5 hours after SAH induction, demonstrated hypointensities in both hemispheres, but predominantly in the ipsilateral cortex. No ADC abnormalities were found in sham-operated animals. The mean lesion volume, as defined on the basis of a significant ADC reduction, was 0. 32 +/- 0. 42 ml in saline-treated controls and 0. 11 +/- 0. 06 ml in Mg++-treated animals (difference 0. 21 ml; p = 0. 045). Serum Mg++ levels were significantly elevated in the Mg++-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of their data, the authors suggest that CSDs play a minor role, if any, in the acute pathophysiology of SAH. Administration of Mg++ reduces the cerebral lesion volume that is present during the acute period after SAH. The neuroprotective value of Mg++ after SAH may, in part, be explained by a reduction in the duration of the ID of brain cell...|$|R
