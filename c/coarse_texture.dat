25|$|Earthenware pottery {{including}} tin-glazed pottery, Victorian majolica, Delftware and faience, {{is made of}} clays or earths {{that give}} a soft paste. Earthenware is opaque, with a relatively <b>coarse</b> <b>texture,</b> while porcelain is semi-transparent, with a fine texture of minute crystals suspended in a transparent glassy ground.|$|E
25|$|Later pulps {{began to}} feature {{interior}} illustrations, depicting {{elements of the}} stories. The drawings were printed in black ink on the same cream-colored paper used for the text, and had to use specific techniques to avoid blotting on the <b>coarse</b> <b>texture</b> of the cheap pulp. Thus, fine lines and heavy detail were usually not an option. Shading was by crosshatching or pointillism, and even {{that had to be}} limited and coarse. Usually the art was black lines on the paper's background, but Finlay and a few others did some work that was primarily white lines against large dark areas.|$|E
500|$|The Wire Haired Fox Terrier has a {{hard and}} crisp double coat with a <b>coarse</b> <b>texture</b> {{underneath}} that provides protection from the cold. It should be so dense that the skin cannot be seen or felt. The individual hairs should twist, but are not curly. An average member of the breed should measure [...] at the withers and weight between [...] It has similar features to the Smooth Fox Terrier with small dark eyes and v-shaped ears. Its body is shorter than it is tall.|$|E

50|$|Silky {{minerals}} have {{a parallel}} arrangement of extremely fine fibres, {{giving them a}} lustre reminiscent of silk. Examples include asbestos, ulexite and the satin spar variety of gypsum. A fibrous lustre is similar, but has a <b>coarser</b> <b>texture.</b>|$|R
50|$|Eriogonum giganteum is {{cultivated}} as an ornamental plant, for use {{in native}} plant, drought tolerant, and wildlife gardens, and in natural landscaping design projects. With its <b>coarser</b> <b>texture</b> and semi-open form, {{it can be a}} good background plant in gardens.|$|R

I am glad that the lofty pointed cap has passed out; the coif becomes my child far better, and I see our tastes still accord as to fashion." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{know that}} the courts of law have made as {{strained}} constructions in other cases. Such is the construction in common recoveries. The method of construction which in that case gives to the persons in remainder, for their security and representative, the door-keeper, crier, or sweeper of the Court, or some other shadowy being without substance or effect, is a fiction of a very <b>coarse</b> <b>texture.</b> This was however suffered, by the acquiescence of the whole kingdom, for ages; because the evasion of the old Statute of Westminster, which authorised perpetuities, had more sense and utility than the law which was evaded. But an attempt to turn the right of election into such a farce and mockery as a fictitious fine and recovery, will, I hope, have another fate; because the laws which give it are infinitely dear to us, and the evasion is infinitely contemptible.|$|E
60|$|The colour of {{all these}} varied tribes is a light reddish brown, with more or less of an olive tinge, not varying in any {{important}} degree over an extent of country as large as all Southern Europe. The hair is equally constant, being invariably black and straight, and of a rather <b>coarse</b> <b>texture,</b> so that any lighter tint, or any wave or curl in it, is an almost certain proof of the admixture of some foreign blood. The face is nearly destitute of beard, and the breast and limbs are free from hair. The stature is tolerably equal, and is always considerably below that of the average European; the body is robust, the breast well developed, the feet small, thick, and short, the hands small and rather delicate. The face is a little broad, and inclined to be flat; the forehead is rather rounded, the brows low, the eyes black and very slightly oblique; the nose is rather small, not prominent, but straight and well-shaped, the apex a little rounded, the nostrils broad and slightly exposed; the cheek-bones are rather prominent, the mouth large, the lips broad and well cut, but not protruding, the chin round and well-formed.|$|E
50|$|An {{everyday}} {{example of}} Ostwald ripening is the re-crystallization of water within ice cream which gives old ice cream a gritty, crunchy texture. Larger ice crystals grow {{at the expense}} of smaller ones within the ice cream, creating a <b>coarser</b> <b>texture.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dried {{apricots}} are a type {{of traditional}} dried fruit. When treated with sulfur dioxide (E220), the color is vivid orange.

60|$|I had {{accepted}} his Oriental fantasies (which, indeed, to do him justice, {{have been recorded}} by scientific societies among the genuine phenomena of natural history), not as matters of indubitable credence, but as allowable specimens of an imaginative traveller's vivid coloring and rich embroidery on the <b>coarse</b> <b>texture</b> and dull neutral tints of truth. The English romance was among the latest communications that he intrusted to my private ear; {{and as soon as}} I heard the first chapter,--so wonderfully akin to what I might have wrought out of my own head, not unpractised in such figments,--I began to repent having made myself responsible for the future nobleman's passage homeward in the next Collins steamer. Nevertheless, should his English rent-roll fall a little behindhand, his Dutch claim for a hundred thousand dollars was certainly in the hands of our government, and might at least be valuable to the extent of thirty pounds, which I had engaged to pay on his behalf. But I have reason to fear that his Dutch riches turned out to be Dutch gilt, or fairy gold, and his English country-seat a mere castle in the air,--which I exceedingly regret, for he was a delightful companion and a very gentlemanly man.|$|E
60|$|These {{two were}} driven into one hut; Estelle, who was evidently {{considered}} {{as the greatest}} prize, was taken into another and rather better one, together with the steward and the Abbe. The Moors, who had swum ashore, had probably told them {{that she was the}} Frankish Bey's daughter; for this, miserable place though it was, appeared to be the best hut in the hamlet, nor was she deprived of her clothes. A sort of bournouse or haik, of <b>coarse</b> <b>texture</b> and very dirty, was given to each of the others, and some rye cakes baked in the ashes. Poor little Estelle turned away her head at first, but Hebert, alarmed at her shivering in her wet clothes, contrived to make her swallow a little, and then took off the soaked dress, and wrapped her in the bournouse. She was by this time almost unconscious from weariness, and made no resistance to the unaccustomed hands, or the disgusting coarseness and uncleanness of her wrapper, but dropped asleep the moment he laid her down, and he applied himself to trying to dry her clothes at a little fire of sticks that had been lighted outside the open space, round which the huts stood.|$|E
60|$|In {{the grim}} Doctor, rough and uncultivated as he seemed, this budding {{intelligence}} found no inadequate instructor. Doctor Grimshawe proved himself {{a far more}} thorough scholar, in the classics and mathematics, than {{could easily have been}} found in our country. He himself must have had rigid and faithful instruction at an early period of life, though probably not in his boyhood. For, though the culture had been bestowed, his mind had been left in so singularly rough a state that {{it seemed as if the}} refinement of classical study could not have been begun very early. Or possibly the mind and nature were incapable of polish; or he may have had a coarse and sordid domestic life around him in his infancy and youth. He was a gem of <b>coarse</b> <b>texture,</b> just hewn out. An American with a like education would more likely have gained a certain fineness and grace, and it would have been difficult to distinguish him from one who had been born to culture and refinement. This sturdy Englishman, after all that had been done for his mind, and though it had been well done, was still but another ploughman, of a long race of such, with a few scratchings of refinement on his hard exterior. His son, if he left one, might be a little less of the ploughman; his grandson, provided the female element were well chosen, might approach to refinement; three generations--a century at least--would be required for the slow toil of hewing, chiselling, and polishing a gentleman out of this ponderous block, now rough from the quarry of human nature. But, in the mean time, he evidently possessed in an unusual degree the sort of learning that refines other minds,--the critical acquaintance with the great poets and historians of antiquity, and apparently an appreciation of their merits, and power to teach their beauty. So the boy had an able tutor, capable, it would seem, of showing him the way to the graces he did not himself possess; besides helping the growth of the strength without which refinement is but sickly and disgusting.|$|E
5000|$|Lithographic {{limestone}} is hard limestone that {{is sufficiently}} fine-grained, homogeneous and defect {{free to be}} used for lithography. Geologists use the term lithographic texture to refer to a grain size under 1/250 mm. [...] The term sublithographic is sometimes used for homogeneous fine-grained limestone with a somewhat <b>coarser</b> <b>texture.</b>|$|R
50|$|HSG Group B Soils with {{moderate}} infiltration rates when thoroughly wetted. These consist chiefly of soils that are moderately deep to deep, moderately well drained to well drained {{with moderate}}ly fine to moderately <b>coarse</b> <b>textures.</b> These soils have a moderate {{rate of water}} transmission (final infiltration rate of 0.15 to 0.30 in./h).|$|R
50|$|Another {{advantage}} is that performance design mixtures can be designed coarse enough to have stone on stone contact.

6000|$|Waymarsh looked gravely ardent, {{over the}} {{finished}} soup, at this array of scruples; Strether hadn't yet got quite {{used to being}} so unprepared for {{the consequences of the}} impression he produced. It was comparatively easy to explain, however, that he hadn't felt sure his guest would please. The person was a young man whose acquaintance he had made but that afternoon in the course of rather a hindered enquiry for another person--an enquiry his new friend had just prevented in fact from being vain. [...] "Oh," [...] said Strether, [...] "I've all sorts of things to tell you!"--and he put {{it in a way that}} was a virtual hint to Waymarsh to help him to enjoy the telling. He waited for his fish, he drank of his wine, he wiped his long moustache, he leaned back in his chair, he took in the two English ladies who had just creaked past them and whom he would even have articulately greeted if they hadn't rather chilled the impulse; so that all he could do was--by way of doing something--to say [...] "Merci, Francois!" [...] out quite loud when his fish was brought. Everything was there that he wanted, everything that could make the moment an occasion, that would do beautifully--everything but what Waymarsh might give. The little waxed salle-a-manger was sallow and sociable; Francois, dancing over it, all smiles, was a man and a brother; the high-shouldered patronne, with her high-held, much-rubbed hands, seemed always assenting exuberantly to something unsaid; the Paris evening in short was, for Strether, in the very taste of the soup, in the goodness, as he was innocently pleased to think it, of the wine, in the pleasant <b>coarse</b> <b>texture</b> of the napkin and the crunch of the thick-crusted bread. These all were things congruous with his confession, and his confession was that he HAD--it would come out properly just there if Waymarsh would only take it properly--agreed to breakfast out, at twelve literally, the next day. He didn't quite know where; the delicacy of the case came straight up in the remembrance of his new friend's [...] "We'll see; I'll take you somewhere!"--for it had required little more than that, after all, to let him right in. He was affected after a minute, face to face with his actual comrade, by the impulse to overcolour. There had already been things in respect to which he knew himself tempted by this perversity. If Waymarsh thought them bad he should at least have his reason for his discomfort; so Strether showed them as worse. Still, he was now, in his way, sincerely perplexed.|$|E

50|$|Black tea grading {{is usually}} based upon {{one of four}} scales of quality. Whole-leaf teas are the highest quality, {{followed}} by broken leaves, fannings, and dusts. Whole-leaf teas are produced {{with little or no}} alteration to the tea leaf. This results in a finished product with a <b>coarser</b> <b>texture</b> than that of bagged teas. Whole-leaf teas are widely considered the most valuable, especially if they contain leaf tips. Broken leaves are commonly sold as medium-grade loose teas. Smaller broken varieties may be included in tea bags.|$|R
