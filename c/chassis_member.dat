50|$|The XJ13 had mid-engine format {{with the}} 5.0 litre V12 engine mounted behind the driver, {{used as a}} {{stressed}} <b>chassis</b> <b>member</b> together with the five-speed manual ZF Transaxle driving the rear wheels.|$|E
50|$|The M8A was an {{evolution}} of the previous M6A design, and featured an all-aluminium seven-litre Chevrolet big-block V8 as a semi-stressed <b>chassis</b> <b>member.</b> The engines were built by Gary Knutson and initially developed 620 bhp. Two complete M8A race cars and one spare tub were built.|$|E
5000|$|The Lancia D50 was a Formula One {{racing car}} {{designed}} by Vittorio Jano for Lancia in 1954. The car's design {{made use of}} many innovative features, {{such as the use}} of the engine as a stressed <b>chassis</b> <b>member,</b> the off-centre positioning of the engine to allow a lower overall height, and pannier fuel cells for better weight distribution and aerodynamics. [...] Six of the cars were built, and two of them are displayed in Italian museums.|$|E
50|$|The car changed {{very little}} during its {{production}} life. The name change to Mercedes-Benz Typ 400 which followed the Daimler/Benz fusion was not accompanied by any {{changes to the}} car. However, in 1927 the centre of gravity was lowered {{as a result of}} a switch to an “underslung” chassis which left the axles directly above the longitudinal <b>chassis</b> <b>members,</b> whereas earlier car had applied the “Hochbett” overslung chassis layout whereby the longitudinal <b>chassis</b> <b>members</b> were attached directly above the axles.|$|R
25|$|The {{prototype}} {{and early}} cars utilised stressed skin aluminium bodywork, though later models incorporated <b>chassis</b> <b>members</b> of steel. The Minicar was amongst the first British cars to use fibreglass body panels.|$|R
50|$|Lightening holes {{became a}} {{prominent}} feature of motor racing in the 1920s and 1930s. <b>Chassis</b> <b>members,</b> suspension components, engine housings and even connecting rods were drilled {{with a range}} of holes, of sizes almost as large as the component.|$|R
50|$|Underneath the curvaceous bodywork, {{the chassis}} was a riveted, {{aluminium}} monocoque, with steel bulkheads onto which the suspension components were mounted. The DFV engine {{was supported in}} an aluminium cradle behind the driver. Unlike the Lotus 49 for which the DFV had been designed, the engine was not used as a structural <b>chassis</b> <b>member.</b> In contrast, the suspension layout was almost a direct copy of contemporary F1 practice. Contemporary observers commented on the oversized front hub components, potentially allowing the car to be converted to four-wheel drive at some point. The radiator was mounted in the nose, although later enhancements to cooling resulted in a wider opening being incorporated from mid-season. Fuel was stored in two deformable cells, one in each sill.|$|E
5000|$|The Europa used a lightweight, folded & welded [...] "minimalist" [...] boxed-steel {{backbone}} chassis with a fibreglass moulded body, {{a combination}} that {{was first used}} by Lotus founder Colin Chapman in the Lotus Elan launched in 1962. Earliest versions of the Europa had the body fully-bonded to the chassis for maximum structural stiffness, however this was soon changed to a bolted-on body to allow normal chassis and body repairs to be made. Unlike the Elan, the Europa had no front-mounted engine or gearbox to accommodate, and so the Europa's main <b>chassis</b> <b>member</b> ran straight forward to intersect a large box-section cross-beam running across the car between the front suspension points. At the rear, the chassis split into a [...] "Y" [...] shape behind the cabin to accommodate the combined engine, transmission and final-drive components, and to support the rear suspension.|$|E
50|$|Air line {{failure is}} {{a failure of the}} tubing which connects the air bags or struts {{to the rest of the}} air system, and is {{typically}} DOT-approved nylon air brake line. This usually occurs when the air lines, which must be routed to the air bags through the chassis of the vehicle, rub against a sharp edge of a <b>chassis</b> <b>member</b> or a moving suspension component, causing a hole to form. This mode of failure will typically take some time to occur after the initial installation of the system, as the integrity of a section of air line is compromised to the point of failure due to the rubbing and resultant abrasion of the material. An air-line failure may also occur if a piece of road debris hits an air line and punctures or tears it, although this is unlikely to occur in normal road use. It does occur in harsh off-road conditions but it still not common if correctly installed.|$|E
50|$|Many detail {{changes were}} made over the years, and a major change from JAP petrol engines to Lister's own diesel engines. The bearing ring was moved above the <b>chassis</b> <b>members</b> and no longer enclosed. This gave better access for {{greasing}} and adjusting the rollers.|$|R
50|$|In-house tooling {{for local}} {{production}} of <b>chassis</b> long <b>member.</b>|$|R
50|$|Devin {{asked for}} some {{changes for the}} final car. For the main <b>chassis</b> <b>members,</b> 3 in round {{cross-section}} tubing replaced the 4 in diameter tubing in the prototype. The 92 in production wheelbase was a compromise between the 90 in of the prototype and the 94 in that Devin had originally asked for. The battery and generator were relocated {{to the rear of}} the car, with the generator being driven off a pulley at the differential.|$|R
5000|$|The main <b>chassis</b> <b>member</b> is a welded {{box-section}} frame. IWL scooters had a {{long wheelbase}} and the Troll 1 was taller than its predecessors, which made the seating position more comfortable but made the machine more vulnerable to crosswinds. In March 1964 Der deutsche Straßenverkehr strongly criticised this shortcoming, {{but in the same}} year Motor Jahr played it down by claiming [...] "Die Seitenwindempfindlichkeit des „Troll“ liegt in normalen Grenzen. Er reagiert auf Seitenböen nicht anders als durchschnittliche Zweiradfahrzeuge und is deshalb trotz seiner etwas höheren Schwerpunktlage auch in solchen Situationen risikilos zu fahren.". ("The Trolls crosswind stability lies within normal limits. It reacts to side gusts no differently than average two-wheeled vehicles and therefore despite a somewhat higher centre of gravity it is safe to ride in such conditions.") Customers were not fooled, and the Troll 1s crosswind instability damaged its reputation and was partly responsible for the model selling less well than its predecessors.|$|E
50|$|SMS-I-Apart from a {{computerised}} LD {{process which}} has enhanced shop capability, the LA Vacuum Metallurgy Technique has been also adopted for secondary refining of steel. This facilitates production of special steels for application in electrical machines, pipe making, tin plate, boilers and auto <b>chassis</b> <b>members.</b> The shop was {{originally designed to}} produce ingots for conversion to slabs through the Slabbing Mill route. However, after the discontinuation of the ingot route, SMS-I produces slabs through casting machines.|$|R
25|$|Enveloping {{this rather}} {{conservative}} chassis was a low, curvaceous alloy-panel body, built in-house by Maserati. Maserati also built a streamlined {{version of the}} 4CL from the outset. Continued engine development, in response to Alfa Romeo's post-war introduction of two-stage supercharging, began to expose weaknesses in the chassis design. In an attempt to improve torsional rigidity Maserati began to experiment with tubular section <b>chassis</b> <b>members.</b> These experimental models ran alongside conventional 4CLs throughout the 1947 season, and {{eventually led to the}} introduction of the 4CLT in 1948.|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{supplied}} with the Daimler Fluid Flywheel coupled to a 4-speed Wilson Pre-selector gearbox. The {{independent front suspension}} used coil springs, while the back axle was suspended using a traditional semi-elliptical set-up. The chassis was [...] "underslung" [...] at the rear with the main <b>chassis</b> <b>members</b> passing below the rear axle. In mid-1950 the restricted ground clearance was improved by {{the adoption of a}} conventional hypoid bevel drive to the rear axle replacing the traditional Daimler underslung worm drive which had hampered sales outside Britain.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design was}} based on its predecessor, the Leyland Olympian, but the chassis was {{modified}} such that only the chassis design and layout remained, with even the grade of steel for the <b>chassis</b> <b>members</b> being changed, Volvo's standard electrical system was used, as well as standard Volvo steering/"Z cam" [...] braking systems. The early Volvo Olympians were offered with Cummins L10 or Volvo TD102KF engine, coupled to Voith DIWA or ZF Ecomat gearbox. From late 1996, only the 9.6-litre Volvo D10A-245 Euro II engine with electronic diesel control was offered.|$|R
5000|$|A {{common type}} of {{micro-alloyed}} steel is improved-formability HSLA. It has a yield strength up to [...] but only costs 24% more than A36 steel (...) [...] One of the disadvantages of this steel {{is that it is}} 30 to 40% less ductile. In the U.S., these steels are dictated by the ASTM standards A1008/A1008M and A1011/A1011M for sheet metal and A656/A656M for plates. These steels were developed for the automotive industry to reduce weight without losing strength. Examples of uses include door-intrusion beams, <b>chassis</b> <b>members,</b> reinforcing and mounting brackets, steering and suspension parts, bumpers, and wheels.|$|R
40|$|Finite element {{method has}} been {{implemented}} {{to modify the}} existing chassis of compressed air Vehicle (C. A.

25|$|The Ibec design, while bespoke, was not adventurous. The main chassis {{was formed}} by a riveted and bonded {{aluminium}} monocoque, behind which the DFV engine and Hewland FG400 gearbox were bolted as stressed <b>chassis</b> <b>members.</b> Suspension was by double wishbones at the front, with twin trailing arms, parallel lower links and single top links at the rear. The car was clothed in fibreglass bodywork which had been properly wind tunnel tested, and which proved highly effective at generating both downforce in corners and stability at high speed. The total cost of designing and building the 308LM was less than £100,000, approximately £0.5 million at 2005 prices, more than most privateer teams, but far lower than many contemporary factory race programs.|$|R
40|$|Tractor Trailers {{are very}} popular and cheaper mode of goods {{transport}} in rural {{as well as}} urban area. But these trailers are manufactured in small scale to moderate scale industry; due to which design of chassis is at primary level. In Present work finite element method has been implemented to modify existing chassis of tractor trailer which ultimately results in reduction of weight and manufacturing cost. For analysis, a 8 ton 4 wheeler trailer manufactured by Awachat Industries. Ltd. Wardha is selected. The finite element analysis of existing chassis revealed the stresses distribution on <b>chassis</b> <b>members.</b> So, an effort is made to modify the structure of existing chassis so that advantage of weight reduction along with safe stress can be obtained...|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{developed}} by Ferdinand Porsche, who had transferred to Daimler from the firm’s Austrian affiliate in 1923. Porsche was the board member with responsibility for new product development. The company’s objective with the new eight cylinder Mercedes-Benz was {{to come up with}} a serious competitor to the Horch 8, and Porsche’s work on the new car appears to have been very rushed. [...] The result was a car with a traditional “overslung” (“Hochbett”) chassis with the longitudinal <b>chassis</b> <b>members</b> directly above the axles, at a time when newer designs increasingly favored “underslung” (“Tiefbett”) chassis layouts on which the axles sat directly above the load bearing chassis beams. The 1928 Mercedes-Benz W08 therefore looked unfashionably tall even at the time of its launch.|$|R

25|$|The Supreme {{was also}} {{manufactured}} as a semi-integral on a DAF chassis. Around 20 were built. They were rear engined and the rear panel design {{was different from}} the Supreme V as it has vents and had odd shaped moulding around the rear window. As a semi-integral the body was required to support the full weight as there were no <b>chassis</b> <b>members</b> to support the body. Opening the side lockers luggage could be piled in one side and extracted from the other as nothing was in the way so it was very cutting edge technology. It is said that 2 of these survive today. The bulk of the 20 were exported, mainly to the Netherlands, the left hand drive version had a tapered front to meet Dutch swept turning-circle requirements.|$|R
25|$|That the {{bodywork}} enclosing all of Chapman's {{innovative technology}} was similar in appearance to the Vanwall Grand Prix cars was no accident, as both cars had been sculpted by pioneer automotive aerodynamacist Frank Costin. As {{with many of}} Lotus's competition cars, the aluminium used to construct the bodywork was extremely thin and offered {{little in the way}} of support for the underlying <b>chassis</b> <b>members.</b> The car was extremely low and compact, with the bonnet barely reaching the same height as the tops of the front wheels, despite the smaller diameters used from the 1959 season onward. The driver sat in a slightly reclined position — nowhere near as extremely inclined as Chapman would later inflict upon his pilots but still unusual for its day — and behind the driver rose a stubby rear fin, incorporating the fuel tank.|$|R
50|$|The 15-40-hp is {{fitted with}} Humber-Perrott semi-servo front wheel brakes. The driver's foot pedal still works the {{transmission}} brake {{and now the}} front wheel brakes as well. A floating shoe gives the semi-servo effect and it relies to some extent on forward motion. Applying the brakes when backing the car receives only half the force. Front axle and stub axles are strengthened to accommodate the higher loads from braking, to the same end the springs are wider {{and there is a}} new cross tube linking the dumb irons (forward ends of the main longitudinal <b>chassis</b> <b>members).</b> Front brake adjustment is carried out by jacking up that end of the car and the hand operated nuts turned until equal pressure is provided to each wheel. The following year a compensating device is installed between the two sets of brakes.|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was intended to}} throw light {{on a number of}} problems: 1) obtain a time history of the force acting on the gear wheels during take-off and landing runs; 2) obtain the time history of the direction of this force (magnitude of its three components along the coordinate axes); 3) derive conclusions as to the design load factors. In connection with the latter, of special interest was the solution of such problems as: a) the dynamic loads in the three main landing attitudes; b) the problem of the true direction of the forces {{for each of the three}} "pure" types of landing; c) combination of the above types; d) the comparison for each of the <b>chassis</b> <b>members</b> of the computed force (according to the design standards) with the actual force measured in the tests so as to determine the actual factors of safety...|$|R
50|$|The chassis had a rigid {{front axle}} {{supported}} by half-elliptic springs and a live rear axle with Austin 7-like quarter-elliptics, allowing the <b>chassis</b> side <b>members</b> to finish {{ahead of the}} rear axle. The three-speed non-synchromesh gearbox was mounted in unit with the engine and transmitted power to the worm gear final drive via a torque tube. The electrical system was 6 volts.|$|R
50|$|Their {{design was}} a {{compromise}} between the top-heavy nature of the tall engine grouping above its wheel and a well thought-out chassis for stability. The bearing between them was a large diameter ring roller bearing, mounted at the lowest part of the chassis. This gave rigidity and stability, even after long wear. A ring of rolled channel girder {{was attached to the}} engine group and rollers on the chassis carried the load upon this. On early Auto-Trucks this bearing is set very low, in line with the <b>chassis</b> <b>members,</b> and is covered by thin steel plates. The front panel of the engine cover is distinctive with large ventilation holes and a Lister signature cut through it. Strangely this panel is made of thick cast iron, providing substantial weight high on the engine and only adding to its top heaviness. To improve visibility of moving vehicles in noisy factories, this panel was often painted white, the rest of the vehicle being Lister's usual brunswick green.|$|R
5000|$|The TR4 {{continues}} to be raced in vintage sports car events and even won an SCCA class championship as late as 1991. In Australia the TR4 was a common sight at hill-climb events and various club rallies and circuit racing events. In 1964 the factory sponsored Team Triumph entered three TR4s in the Canadian Shell 4000 rally. These [...] "works" [...] cars were reportedly built with gussets on the <b>chassis</b> <b>members</b> and aluminium body panels to strengthen and lighten the car. After import, the engines were prepared by Kastner in New York, where they were also fitted with lightweight magnesium wheels. Although they did not place well in the rally, the surviving cars have become quite valuable, {{one of which is}} owned by Neil Revington, the proprietor of Revington TR in the UK. Indeed, the TR4 became a celebrated rally car in Europe and the UK during early to mid-sixties, and various replicas are still campaigned by privateers in vintage rally events throughout Europe.|$|R
5000|$|The {{exhibit at}} the 1964 show was a Manchester Corporation unit with a Park Royal body derived from the BET design, but {{featuring}} deeper windows forward of the exit door. The reviewer for Buses Illustrated noted the unladen weight was 6.5 tons, even though the body was 'well-finished'. The two bodied Panthers on show-stands were for Glasgow and Hull and had, respectively an Alexander body weighing 7ton, 8.75cwt and a Charles H Roe body tipping the scales at 7ton 6cwt. Thus a bodied Panther Cub weighed almost one ton less than the equivalent Panther.

40|$|This thesis {{presented}} about {{design and}} analysis of three wheel prototype car chassis for Shell Eco Marathon Asia 2012 competition. Base on the Existing Model, there have a few improvement to be done. First thing {{is to reduce the}} weight of the chassis where appropriate by designing more compact car. Secondly, this study also conduct to overcome the worst bending displacement where occur at driver cockpit, and lastly to provide extra large engine spaces where the Existing Design only have very limited spaces. Corresponds to the project background and problem statements, it is decided that the objectives of the project are to analyze and improve the existing car chassis based on Shell Eco Marathon Asia 2012 requirement, to redesign and proposed new chassis of prototype car which able to withstand the load applied on the chassis structure with minimum bending displacement, and to simulate the design using FEA software. The Project scopes are to study the concept of prototype car category for Shell Eco Marathon Asia 2012 Event, and evaluating with analysis the existing car design for previous competition. This project also covers to redesign three optional chassis of prototype car for Shell Eco Marathon Asia 2012, to analyze the optional chassis using FEA software, requirement to study was focus on static condition and stress simulation analysis only, and to select the best option which is capable to be fabricated at UMP. Three different chassis models have been designed by using Solidwork 2012. Then, analyzed by using Finite Element Analysis: Algor 23. 1 software. Three parameters have been set up which are the weights of the chassis, the bending displacement of the <b>chassis</b> <b>members,</b> and the worst stress occurs on the chassis structure. The comparison result proves that the new proposed design in Model 2 is lighter than the Existing Model and the decrement is about 13. 89 % and the bending of the structure of new Design 2 was decreased too. Thus, the objectives of the project were achieved and the design has been proposed to Shell Eco Marathon Asia 2012 Team...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Many torque {{carrying}} {{members have}} circular sections such as shafts. However, {{there are certain}} structural <b>members</b> like automotive <b>chassis</b> frames, cross <b>members</b> and machine frames which are often subjected to twisting loads and their cross sections are non circular. several methods were developed to analyze such sections such as Saint Venant’s semi inverse method, Prandtl’s elastic membrane analogy [...] . etc. In this paper, the second order partial differential stress function equation for non-circular torsional members is applied on a rectangular section for different b/h (height /width of section) values and the solutions for maximum torsional shear stress are found by employing second order finite difference method. The results are compared to the results obtained from commercial finite element software (ANSYS 10) and by direct solution of the stress function equation using analytical correlations available for rectangular sections. The results obtained by different approaches are in close congruence with a percentage deviation of only 3. 22. It is observed that, in implementing second order finite difference scheme, the error in estimating stress is proportional to S 2.
