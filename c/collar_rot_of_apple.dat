Surveys have been done to describe disease symptoms, estimate the disease incidence, and identify the pathogens associated with this disease in southern Syria. Disease incidence was 0. 08 – 10  % in most studied sites, only in Alroom location {{it was up to}} 14. 7  % in 2014 and 17. 8  % in 2015, with average of 11. 8  %. Symptoms included small pale green leaves, sparse foliage, and a reddish-brown discoloration of inner bark of the infected area at the base of infected tree. The isolated fungi belonged to genera and form genera Phytophthora, Rosellinia, Rhizoctonia, Phialophora, Acremonium, Pestalotiopsis, Cylindrocarpon and Verticillium. Phytophthora was isolated from all infected trees, and was the most frequent pathogen (53. 7  % of total isolates). Phytophthora isolates recovered from crown cankers of apple were identified as P. cactorum (91. 5  %) and P. cambivora (8. 5 %).

The present investigation was carried out for ecofriendly management of the disease, it includes various practices i. e. summer ploughing, soil solarization, biocontrol agents, green manuring and soil amendments. The soil and seedling dip treatment with Trichoderma viride (T 5) @ 4 g/kg of seedling and 50 mg with 5 g FYM/m 2 respectively was found most effective in reducing the per cent disease incidence followed by summer ploughing.

40|$|During a {{study of}} the species of Botryosphaeriaceae {{associated}} with oak decline in Tunisia, a large collection of Diplodia strains were isolated from Quercus afares, Q. canariensis and Q. suber trees showing a progressive dieback of shoots and branches, trunk canker and exudates and <b>collar</b> <b>rot.</b> Most <b>of</b> the isolates were identified as Diplodia corticola, while two isolates from Q. canariensis were morphologically and phylogenetically (ITS and tef 1 -alpha sequences data) distinct from all other known species of Diplodia. They are described here as Diplodia quercivora sp. nov. In addition, phylogenedc analyses showed {{for the first time the}} existence of two distinct lineages within D. corticola. In artificial inoculation experiments, D. quercivora caused necrotic lesions on bark and wood of three Mediterranean oak species, Q. ilex, Q. pubescens and Q. suber. In particular, among the oak species tested, Q. pubescens was the most susceptible...|$|R
