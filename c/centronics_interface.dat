5000|$|... 825 80-Column Printer - dot matrix, {{used the}} <b>Centronics</b> <b>interface</b> so {{required}} an 850 (repackaged Centronics 737) ...|$|E
5000|$|The LaserJet Plus {{followed}} in September 1985, priced at US$3,995. It introduced [...] "soft fonts", treatments like bold and italic {{and other features}} including a parallel (<b>Centronics)</b> <b>interface.</b> It also included 512 kilobytes of memory, which was just enough to print graphics at 300 dpi that covered about 70% of the letter-size page area.|$|E
50|$|Complete <b>Centronics</b> printer <b>interface.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nibble Mode is an {{interface}} {{that allows}} the device to transmit data four bits (a nibble) at a time, (re)using four of the status lines of Compatibility Mode for data. This is the Bi-tronics mode introduced by HP and is generally used for enhanced printer status. Although never officially supported with these, Nibble Mode works {{with most of the}} pre-IEEE-1284 <b>Centronics</b> <b>interfaces</b> as well.|$|R
50|$|Standard <b>Centronics</b> {{parallel}} <b>interface</b> allows {{connection of}} {{a multitude of}} different types of printer from very cheap thermal types to high speed matrix printers or word processors quality daisy-wheel printers.|$|R
5000|$|Pravetz 8С - [...] "streamlined version" [...] of the 8А model. 128 KB RAM integrated, but not expandable. Less {{number of}} slots, but all {{essential}} controllers were integrated on the motherboard - Parallel (<b>Centronics)</b> <b>interface,</b> FDD controllers, Joystick and sometimes with RS-232. A version of 8C is the Pravetz 8VC, which features terminal like design.|$|E
5000|$|XEP80 Interface Module - {{provides}} 80-column {{display and}} a <b>Centronics</b> parallel <b>interface</b> for a printer, based on NS405, an 8048 based chip. Attached via a joystick port controlled at 15625 baud horizontal video timing.|$|R
50|$|The {{follow-up}} Super Gold Card had a 24 MHz 68020 CPU, 4MB of RAM, {{and added}} a <b>Centronics</b> parallel printer <b>interface.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{provided}} only {{floppy disk}} and <b>Centronics</b> parallel <b>interfaces,</b> plus a non-maskable interrupt button. The +D's casing was simple folded steel, {{which was not}} only stronger than before but acted as a heatsink, improving reliability. Apart from the missing ports, though, it was software-compatible with the larger device.|$|R
50|$|TIM-600 {{architecture}} {{was based}} on three system buses(32, 16 and 8-bits respectively). CPU performs 5,000.000 simple operations per second. Primary memory RAM had 8 x 2 MB capacity max. There were the eight TIM terminals or other equipment units max. connected by RS-232C. <b>Centronics</b> types <b>interface</b> used for the line printers. Also, there were possibilities for the connections of two hard disks {{as well as the}} magnetic cassettes and diskettes.|$|R
5000|$|There were severe {{shortcomings}} of early Commodore printers, so CARDCO created the Card Print A (C/?A) printer interface that emulated Commodore printers by converting the Commodore serial <b>interface</b> to a <b>Centronics</b> parallel printer <b>interface</b> to allow numerous 3rd-party printers {{to be connected}} to a Commodore 64 or VIC-20.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the Sun-3 models, the Sun386i has a PC-like {{motherboard}} and [...] "mini-tower"-style chassis. Two variants were produced, the Sun386i/150 and the Sun386i/250 with a 20 or 25 MHz CPU respectively. The motherboard {{includes the}} CPU, 80387 FPU, 82380 timer/DMA/interrupt controller and a custom Ethernet IC called BABE ("Bus Adapter Between Ethernet"). Floppy disk, SCSI, RS-232 and <b>Centronics</b> parallel <b>interfaces</b> are also provided, as are four ISA slots (one 8-bit, three 16-bit) and four proprietary 32-bit [...] "local" [...] bus slots. The latter {{are used for}} RAM and frame buffer cards.|$|R
50|$|As it {{was meant}} for the home market, it had a built in {{television}} RF modulator as well as RGB output and was meant {{to work with a}} basic audio tape recorder to save and load data. Error-checking of recorded programs was bugged, frequently causing user-created programs to fail when loaded back in.An additional feature was a <b>Centronics</b> compatible printer <b>interface.</b>|$|R
50|$|ATM (ATM Turbo) is a ZX Spectrum clone, {{developed}} in Moscow, in 1991, by two firms, MicroArt and ATM. It has a Z80 at 7 MHz, 1024 kB RAM, 128 kB ROM, AY-8910 (two ones in upgraded models), 8-bit DAC, 8-bit 8-channel ADC, RS-232, <b>Centronics,</b> Beta Disk <b>Interface,</b> IDE interface, AT/XT keyboard, text mode (80x25, 16 colours, 8x8 pattern), and 3 graphics modes.|$|R
50|$|Motorola 68302 Integrated Multiprotocol Processor {{featured}} a RISC processor controlled either by a microcode in ROM or by downloadable firmware. Various forms of microcode were shipped for different applications, for example to support Signaling System 7 communications or <b>Centronics</b> parallel <b>interface.</b> Motorola 68360 QUICC {{was the first}} design to feature Communications Processor Module, offering microcode for SS7 and ISDN applications. Specifications of the microcontroller programming interface were generally not shipped to customers. It was possible to run 68360 in slave mode and to use only CPM part of the chip, for example in the M68360QUADS-040 board, where 68040 CPU (master) is coupled with 68360 CPM (slave), with CPU of 68360 processor being disabled.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{incorporated}} in February 1983. Initially, they produced simple peripherals {{such as an}} RS-232 to <b>Centronics</b> parallel printer <b>interface</b> adapter. Later, they designed the Expanderam series of RAM expansion cards for the QL, {{which led to the}} Trump Card combined RAM expansion and floppy disk interface. This was notable in that it mapped RAM into memory space reserved for external peripheral devices, thus allowing the QL's RAM to be expanded to 768 kB rather than the official limit of 512 kB.|$|R
50|$|The unit {{under the}} monitor housed a 3½-inch {{floppy disk drive}} and the system power supply. The {{remainder}} of the system was housed in the same unit as the keyboard, much like a conventional Master 128. The cartridge and cassette ports were removed as a space saving measure, and RS-232 hardware not populated on the circuit board as standard. A multifunction mouse and joystick port was provided as a 9-pin D type with its function configured in software. A <b>Centronics</b> printer <b>interface</b> was also provided. The 1 MHz bus and analogue port were not provided on the Compact. Additionally, no internal sockets were provided for adding a co-processor or 2nd processor. However, the machine did include a 50-way Expansion Port edge-connector {{on the right side}} of the keyboard, that carried the same signals as Cartridge Socket#3 on a Master 128.|$|R
5000|$|The Q40 {{consists}} of a sub-AT form factor board comprising a 40 MHz 68040 processor, 1 MiB of video RAM, and several PLDs implementing a QL-compatible video display generator, an ISA bus, stereo 20 kHz audio DACs and an AT keyboard interface. Floppy disk, ATA hard disk, RS-232 and <b>Centronics</b> printer port <b>interfaces</b> are provided by an ISA [...] "multi-I/O" [...] card {{in one of the}} two ISA slots provided. Up to 32 MiB of FPM or EDO RAM can be installed in two 72-pin SIMM slots. Also included are sockets for two ROM devices, 2 kiB of non-volatile RAM and a real-time clock.|$|R
50|$|The MXB-1 Memory Expansion Board was {{designed}} {{by a member of}} the VDUEB Users' Club. The MXB-1 contained space for extra EPROMs, an optional battery backed real time clock, a <b>centronics</b> compatible printer <b>interface</b> and address decoding for up to 192kB of RAM. The extra RAM was installed by replacing the standard 4116 16k × 1 bit RAM chips with 4164 64k × 1 bit RAM chips. The CPU's 64kB address limit was worked around through bank switching. The MXB-1 was mostly of benefit to users running the CP/M disk operating system, since CP/M could then have a full 64kB of RAM for programs, with up to 128kB being used as a small RAM disk.|$|R
5000|$|The Datasette (cassette) {{port and}} RF port were {{omitted from the}} SX-64. Because it has a {{built-in}} disk drive and monitor, Commodore did not perceive {{a need for a}} tape drive or television connector. However, the lack of a Datasette port poses a problem for a number of C64 <b>Centronics</b> parallel printer <b>interfaces,</b> since several popular designs [...] "borrowed" [...] their +5V power supply from the port. This was not an issue for later interfaces which were supplied with an AC adapter power supply, or those which can use the +5V line supplied by the Centronics port (Pin #18) on the printer itself, if the printer implements it. Alternatively, a +5V supply is also available from the joystick ports.|$|R
5000|$|Xetec's {{best selling}} product is its line of printer interfaces, {{which allows the}} use of many models of non-Commodore parallel-interface {{printers}} with Commodore computers. Some of the popular printers of that era that are supported include Canon, C-Itoh, Star Micronix, Epson, NEC, Okidata, and Panasonic. Early interface models (such as the [...] "Serial Printer Interface" [...] and [...] "Graphics Printer Interface") simply convert from Commodore's serial format to the more standard <b>Centronics</b> parallel <b>interface,</b> with only minimal ASCII conversions and graphic character printing. The Super Graphix Jr adds support for 50+ printers and [...] "Near Letter Quality", which is a technique of using multi-pass graphic printing to achieve higher quality text printing. The more sophisticated Super Graphix also adds an 8K data buffer, screen dump support, two user-loadable fonts (from a library of fonts on the included disk), and a font creation program. The Super Graphix Gold adds a 32K buffer, 4 fixed and 4 user-loadable fonts (from a library of fonts on disk), 10 font printing effects, picture printing, built-in screen dump programs, fast-serial support, and the rather unusual ability to interface a printer directly to a disk drive (for printing pictures and loading fonts directly from disk).|$|R
40|$|MEMESS V 5 is {{the current}} version of a modular-expandable data {{acquisition}} and control system. MEMESS is based on a personal computer, it is capable to perform pre-defined measurement sequences and it permits a fully automatic data acquisition for test facilities. Compared to version V 4 (see Wissenschaftliche Berichte FZKA 5788) it is extended by several functions and it is run time optimized. MEMESS has the following features: - measurement with Schlumberger 3595 Isolated Measurement Pods (IMPs), - control of ISEL steppers, - operation of an independent Slave-PC via serial RS 232 interface, - real time calculation of combined quantities from measured data, - graphical online data display, -fully automatic long-time data acquisition supporting all components mentioned above. In Version V 5 the following items are new: - control of <b>centronics</b> relais <b>interfaces,</b> - threshold control of all components depending on measured values, - trace of events caused by threshold control, - save data using a definable mask. This report is the manual for the installation, the configuration and the operation of MEMESS. The operation of MEMESS is illustrated with a demo version on CD-Rom that can be ordered from the authors on request. The demo program supports all the functions of the original, however, the control of hardware like ISEL, IMPs or relais has been disabled. The measured data is simulated by random data. (orig.)

50|$|Network {{connections}} such as Ethernet are {{not generally}} regarded as buses, although the difference is largely conceptual rather than practical. An attribute generally used to characterize a bus is that power {{is provided by the}} bus for the connected hardware. This emphasizes the busbar origins of bus architecture as supplying switched or distributed power. This excludes, as buses, schemes such as serial RS-232, parallel <b>Centronics,</b> IEEE 1284 <b>interfaces</b> and Ethernet, since these devices also needed separate power supplies. Universal Serial Bus devices may use the bus supplied power, but often use a separate power source. This distinction is exemplified by a telephone system with a connected modem, where the RJ11 connection and associated modulated signalling scheme is not considered a bus, and is analogous to an Ethernet connection. A phone line connection scheme is not considered to be a bus with respect to signals, but the Central Office uses buses with cross-bar switches for connections between phones.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the cost}} of a LaserWriter was several times that of a dot-matrix impact printer, some means to share the printer with several Macs was desired. LANs were complex and expensive, so Apple {{developed}} its own networking scheme, LocalTalk. Based on the AppleTalk protocol stack, LocalTalk connected the LaserWriter to the Mac over an RS-422 serial port. At 230.4 kbit/s LocalTalk was slower than the <b>Centronics</b> PC parallel <b>interface,</b> but allowed several computers to share a single LaserWriter. PostScript enabled the LaserWriter to print complex pages containing high-resolution bitmap graphics, outline fonts, and vector illustrations. The LaserWriter could print more complex layouts than the HP Laserjet and other non-Postscript printers. Paired with the program Aldus PageMaker, the LaserWriter gave the layout editor an exact replica of the printed page. The LaserWriter offered a generally faithful proofing tool for preparing documents for quantity publication, and could print smaller quantities directly. The Mac platform quickly gained the favor of the emerging desktop-publishing industry, a market in which the Mac is still important.|$|R
