5|$|Stationed in Alabama at {{the time}} of Hendrix's birth, Al was denied the {{standard}} military furlough afforded servicemen for childbirth; his commanding officer placed him in the stockade to prevent him from going AWOL to see his infant son in Seattle. He spent two months locked up without trial, and while in the stockade received a telegram announcing his son's birth. During Al's three-year absence, Lucille struggled to raise their son. When Al was away, Hendrix was mostly cared for by family members and friends, especially Lucille's sister Delores Hall and her friend Dorothy Harding. Al received an honorable discharge from the U.S. Army on September 1, 1945. Two months later, unable to find Lucille, Al went to the Berkeley, California, home of a family friend named Mrs. Champ, who had taken <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>and</b> had attempted to adopt Hendrix; this is where Al saw his son for the first time.|$|E

25|$|The {{children}} who arrived at Carlisle {{able to speak}} some English were presented to the other children as translators.

25|$|Related, yet {{different}} was {{the notion}} of male beauty.

The idea was that in this way he would grow up to such a beauty that he would be irresistible to chief's daughters. Then a child of high rank would be born into the family, elevating the status of all.|$|E
25|$|Doberman Pinschers {{are well}} known as intelligent, alert, and tenaciously loyal companions and guard dogs.

The Doberman is driven, strong, and sometimes stubborn. Owning one requires commitment and care, but if trained well, they can be wonderful family dogs. With a consistent approach they can be easy to train and will learn very quickly. As with all dogs, if properly trained, they can be excellent with children.|$|E
25|$|In Vaishnavism, the {{building}} of a temple for the murti is considered an act of devotion, but non-Murti symbolism is also common wherein the aromatic Tulsi plant or Saligrama is an aniconic reminder of the spiritualism in Vishnu. In the Shaivism tradition of Hinduism, Shiva may be represented as a masculine idol, or half man half woman ardhanarishvara form, in an anicon Linga-Yoni form. The worship rituals associated with the Murti, correspond to ancient cultural practices for a beloved guest, and the Murti is welcomed, taken <b>care</b> <b>of,</b> <b>and</b> then requested to retire.|$|E

25|$|Many of today's {{armed forces}} of {{independent}} countries that once {{were part of the}} French Empire share customs and traditions closely similar if not identical to those of the French military regarding organisation of military arms, army and navy rank structures and uniform styles. Indeed, in countries where the decolonisation process had been conducted through peaceful political negotiations (chiefly French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa), French colonial units were sometimes directly inherited by the former colonies where they had been raised to form the basis of the new national armies. This legacy not only included colour etiquette (the way colours are respected, taken <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>and</b> paraded), but also design, adapted to new national flag designs.|$|E

[...] Jarrow commented on Timbers' idea of using children to tell a story about Scientology: [...] "I did a lot of work on cults in college, and what I learned is that they sort of turn you into a child by appealing to that part of you that wants to be taken <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>and</b> given answers.
