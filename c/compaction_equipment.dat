40|$|This chapter {{seeks to}} assess the {{advantages}} and disadvantages of intelligent Compaction (IC), as well as formulating a comparison with conventional compaction methods in terms of efficiency. This goal was achieved through in situ application of various technologies to two distinct types of material: a soil-rockfill mixture and a sandy soil. Data was obtained and analysed by the IC continuous information, as well as by the application of several different conventional compaction control tests and methods. Results show that the IC technology presents a superior performance, as well as various advantages when compared to conventional compactors. The chapter begins with the description of the demonstration project carried out for that purpose, including two types of geomaterials, available <b>compaction</b> <b>equipments</b> and construction planning. Compaction efficiency of the compactors on both soil-rockfill mixture and soil materials with different thicknesses used in the experimental sections is analyzed through different monitoring devices are presented. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

30|$|The shale quarry dusts {{in their}} natural state {{can be used as}} fill and {{embankments}} material but are unsuitable as sub-base and bases materials unless improved. The presence of the carbonate minerals contributed to the improved strength of the SQD for a given cement type and dosage. The stabilization of the SQD with the Portland cement improved the geotechnical properties of the cement stabilized shale material. While the swellability indicators such as plasticity index and linear shrinkage reduced by about 56.2 and 46.6 %, respectively, the bearing capacity and strength properties improved by about 25.0 and 37.6 %, respectively. The suppression of plasticity made the cement stabilized shale quarry dust more friable, stiff and easily workable. At 3 % Portland cement content and more, the cement treated-stabilized shale dust satisfied Nigerian highway construction specifications for road materials, especially as fills and embankment; for both light and heavy trafficked roads with the reduction in the swellability indicators. The use of heavy <b>compaction</b> <b>equipments</b> resulted in increased strength and stability and is thereby recommended each time the stabilized shale quarry dust is considered for use in road projects. The increased strength and durability is considered long term stabilization that takes place during and after curing. Their use as base course and sub base course, demands caution as although they met other requirements, the relatively high LL (above the recommended limits) may be an indication of expansion and swelling on moisture influx. Compaction tests reveal that although the treatment of the material with 9 % Portland cement would result to increased quality of the cement stabilized shale dust, further addition of the Portland cement greater than 9 % would not be of any economic value as it may possibly influence the quality of the treated material negatively. Interestingly, the trends of results obtained in this research, to some extent satisfy the benefits of lime stabilization recommended by United States National Lime Association.|$|R

40|$|What is <b>compaction?</b> Moving <b>equipment</b> and logs {{over the}} surface of forest soils causes gouges and ruts in the mineral soil, {{displaces}} organic matter, and can cause compaction. Compaction is measured by pore volume (the size spaces between soil particles), bulk density (soil weight per unit volume), soil aeration (the amount of air in the soil), water infiltration (rate of water movement into the soil), and saturated hydraulic conductivity (the abil-ity of soil to transmit water). Compaction is the component of soil productivity most influenced by forest management, but the degree to which soils may be compacted depends upon initial soil bulk density. For example, low bulk density soils (such as volcanic ash-cap soils) are much easier to compact than those soils with a high base-line bulk density. Why is it important?

Using measurements of tread widths and wheel spacing, a series of processes in a GIS was performed to generate a map indicating the level of traffic that occurred in each area of the field. After all field operations were complete as well as the GIS analysis, fields were sampled for bulk density again. Sample locations were then based on the number of passes that had occurred. Initial results showed that 65 - 85 % of the field’s area was tracked. Bulk density ranged from 0. 5 to 0. 8 g/cm 3 in the organic soil, and from 1. 6 to 1. 8 g/cm 3 in the sandy soils.

30|$|The {{consequences}} of salvage logging for vegetation recovery after fire {{are not well}} understood (Peterson et al. 2009). Post-fire salvage logging is often challenged due to the perception of compounding detrimental ecological effects following fire (McIver and Starr 2001, Beschta et al. 2004). Few have studied salvage logging effects on vegetation recovery, but see Klock (1975), Lindenmayer (2006), and Peterson et al. (2009). Post-fire salvage logging is done to extract marketable timber (Franklin and Agee 2003, Sessions et al. 2004), decrease fuel accumulations (Brown et al. 2003, McIver and Ottmar 2007) that could fuel future fires (Donato et al. 2006, Keyser et al. 2009), and lessen the potential for insect infestation (Brown et al. 2003). Opponents of salvage logging cite altered vegetation recovery and nutrient cycling (Lindenmayer and Noss 2006), lost habitat for cavity nesting birds (Hutto 2006), and damage to established tree seedlings (Donato et al. 2006). Fire-impacted soils may also be susceptible to mineral soil exposure, displacement, and <b>compaction</b> by logging <b>equipment,</b> resulting in increased potential for sedimentation and erosion (McIver and Starr 2001, Karr et al. 2004, Wagenbrenner et al. 2015) and potentially compounding the effects of fire on vegetation recovery trajectories.|$|R

It was found that water temperature has a significant effect on coal log wear in pipe. More wear occurs when the water temperature is higher. This is good news because the water temperature in an underground pipe is expected to be relatively low. (Wei Li under Dr. Brett Gunnink. 6. The standard coal log compaction test has been conducted for a second time with improved results (supervised by Bill Burkett). 7. Tests were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} compaction pressure, binder concentration, binder-coal sample mixing time, compaction peak load time and coal log curing time. It was found that variation of pressure had the strongest effect on the tensile strength of the coal logs (Wilson/Zhao). 8. Practical experience has been gained in analyzing CLP effluent water, and dealing with regulatory officials on CLP effluent water discharge (Wilson/Paano). 9. Costs of many items of the CLP Pilot Plant (6 -inch-diameter pipeline 3, 000 ft long recirculating loop) have been determined; pumps and pump seals have been selected; a clarifier for treating CLP effluent water has been selected; a sand bed has been designed to clean up the sludge discharged from the clarifier; detailed design of the diverters has been completed (Dr. Charles Lenau). 10.

40|$|Approximately {{two million}} {{hectares}} {{of land in}} the U. S. have been impacted by surface coal mining and subsequent reclamation. Soil replacement strategies follow standards set by state and federal regulations; however, permits allow for new techniques, such as the soil replacement method studied in this project, in order {{to improve the quality of}} the land. A new strategy, which involves dumping soil in overlapping piles with minimal <b>equipment</b> <b>compaction,</b> has been studied in the Appalachian coal region on a range of site conditions. However, this approach has not been evaluated in the Eastern Interior region, which includes Indiana. This study assessed the relationships of soil physiochemical and biological conditions on plant survival, growth, and root development by investigating growth responses of seedlings planted on standard graded (GR) plots and those planted on loosely dumped (LD) soil. The study, located on a reclaimed mine site in southern Indiana, used a split plot design. A total of 3200 seedlings of four hardwood species, northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.), white oak (Quercus bicolor W.), Shumard oak (Quercus shumardii B.), and American chestnut (Castanea dentate B.), were used. ^ Soil physical properties of the LD and GR soils showed significant treatment effects. Bulk density, moisture retention and porosity of the LD soil were favorable for plant growth. The GR soil had a significantly higher bulk density (1. 74 g/cm 3) compared to the LD soil (1. 54 g/cm 3) resulting in root impairment. The chemical properties of the LD and GR soils showed little variation and had low fertility status, organic carbon contents, and cation exchange capacities consistent with that of a subsurface soil. The presence and activity of soil microorganisms measured through microbial biomass (MB) and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis were low and reflected the poor soil quality with slight treatment differences. ^ Seedling survival was significantly higher in the LD treatment compared to the GR treatment at the end of the second growing season. Above ground growth of the four hardwood species did not favor one soil replacement method over the other as few treatment effects were observed. A few exceptions to this generalization were observed which favored the LD treatment: average plant biomass significantly increased and plant water potential significantly decreased (less water stressed) in the LD treatment. The similarities in above ground growth among treatments is attributed, in part, to the short duration of the study (17 months) which may not be a sufficient amount of time for differences in above ground growth to manifest themselves. ^ In contrast, the below-ground growth parameters indicate that the method of soil replacement influenced root morphology and architecture due to the difference in soil properties. Increased lateral and tap root dry weights, root volume and projected root area (measured by WinRHIZO) were observed in seedlings grown on the LD treatment. It is likely that bulk density was the main root-restricting factor. ^ American chestnut seedlings ranked highest in root and shoot parameters, as well as plant water potential; yet this species ranked lowest in survival and had the greatest amount of dieback. In contrast, Shumard oak seedlings generally ranked second or third in root and shoot parameters; and yet had the highest survival rate and largest increase in lateral root dry weight compared to all other species. ^ Overall, this study showed that seedling survival and growth was favorable on the LD treatment. The below ground root responses measured with traditional or WinRHIZO analyses were clear indicators that the seedlings favored the LD treatment. In general, above-ground growth parameters were not sensitive indicators of growth over the 17 -month study period, whereas below-ground root parameters proved to be sensitive indicators of seedling growth. ...|$|R

Compaction is {{a major portion of}} Wyoming’s road construction budget, in which many resources, such as <b>compaction</b> <b>equipment</b> and manpower, are deployed to ensure that the field compaction attains the desired design requirements and specifications. Due to the heterogeneity of pavement materials, variability in <b>compaction</b> <b>equipment</b> and operators, and challenges in maintaining uniform lift thickness and a range of moisture contents for a specified percent of compaction, achieving the required compaction requirement is a daunting task during a road construction (Mooney et al., 2010).

40|$|The {{two main}} sources of biomass for energy {{generation}} are purpose-grown energy crops and waste materials. Energy crops, such as Miscanthus and short rotation woody crops (coppice), are cultivated mainly for energy purposes and {{are associated with the}} food vs. fuels debate, which is concerned with whether land should be used for fuel rather than food production. The use of residues from agriculture, such as barley, canola, oat and wheat straw, for energy generation circumvents the food vs. fuel dilemma and adds value to existing crops. In fact, these residues represent an abundant, inexpensive and readily available source of renewable lignocellulosic biomass. In order to reduce industry’s operational cost as well as to meet the requirement of raw material for biofuel production, biomass must be processed and handled in an efficient manner. Due to its high moisture content, irregular shape and size, and low bulk density, biomass is very difficult to handle, transport, store, and utilize in its original form. Densification of biomass into durable compacts is an effective solution to these problems and it can reduce material waste. Upon densification, many agricultural biomass materials, especially those from straw and stover, result in a poorly formed pellets or compacts that are more often dusty, difficult to handle and costly to manufacture. This is caused by lack of complete understanding on the natural binding characteristics of the components that make up biomass. An integrated approach to postharvest processing (chopping, grinding and steam explosion), and feasibility study on lab-scale and pilot scale densification of non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, oat and wheat straw was successfully established to develop baseline data and correlations, that assisted in performing overall specific energy analysis. A new procedure was developed to rapidly characterize the lignocellulosic composition of agricultural biomass using the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In addition, baseline knowledge was created to determine the physical and frictional properties of non-treated and steam exploded agricultural biomass grinds. Particle size reduction of agricultural biomass was performed to increase the total surface area, pore size of the material and the number of contact points for inter-particle bonding in the compaction process. Predictive regression equations having higher R 2 values were developed that could be used by biorefineries to perform economic feasibility of establishing a processing plant. Specific energy required by a hammer mill to grind non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, oat and wheat straw showed a negative power correlation with hammer mill screen sizes. Rapid and cost effective quantification of lignocellulosic components (cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin) of agricultural biomass (barley, canola, oat and wheat) is essential to determine the effect of various pre-treatments (such as steam explosion) on biomass used as feedstock for the biofuel industry. A novel procedure to quantitatively predict lignocellulosic components of non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, oat and wheat straw was developed using Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Regression equations having R 2 values of 0. 89, 0. 99 and 0. 98 were developed to predict the cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin compounds of biomass, respectively. The average absolute difference in predicted and measured cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in agricultural biomass was 7. 5 %, 2. 5 %, and 3. 8 %, respectively. Application of steam explosion pre-treatment on agricultural straw significantly altered the physical and frictional properties, which has direct significance on designing new and modifying existing bins, hoppers and feeders for handling and storage of straw for biofuel industry. As a result, regression equations were developed to enhance process efficiency by eliminating the need for experimental procedure while designing and manufacturing of new handling <b>equipment.</b> <b>Compaction</b> of low bulk density agricultural biomass is a critical and desirable operation for sustainable and economic availability of feedstock for the biofuel industry. A comprehensive study of the compression characteristics (density of pellet and total specific energy required for compression) of ground non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, oat and wheat straw obtained from three hammer mill screen sizes of 6. 4, 3. 2 and 1. 6 mm at 10 % moisture content (wb) was conducted. Four preset pressures of 31. 6, 63. 2, 94. 7 and 138. 9 MPa, were applied using an Instron testing machine to compress samples in a cylindrical die. It was determined that the applied pressure (60. 4 %) was the most significant factor affecting pellet density followed by the application of steam explosion pre-treatment (39. 4 %). Similarly, the type of biomass (47. 1 %) is the most significant factor affecting durability followed by the application of pre-treatment (38. 2 %) and grind size (14. 6 %). Also, the applied pressure (58. 3 %) was the most significant factor affecting specific energy required to manufacture pellets followed by the biomass (15. 3 %), pre-treatment (13. 3 %) and grind size (13. 2 %), which had lower but similar effect affect on specific energy. In addition, correlations for pellet density and specific energy with applied pressure and hammer mill screen sizes having highest R 2 values were developed. Higher grind sizes and lower applied pressures resulted in higher relaxations (lower pellet densities) during storage of pellets. Three compression models, namely: Jones model, Cooper-Eaton model, and Kawakita-Ludde model were considered to determine the pressure-volume and pressure-density relationship of non-treated and steam exploded straws. Kawakita-Ludde model provided the best fit to the experimental data having R 2 values of 0. 99 for non-treated straw and 1. 00 for steam exploded biomass samples. The steam exploded straw had higher porosity than non-treated straw. In addition, the steam exploded straw was easier to compress since it had lower yield strength or failure stress values compared to non-treated straw. Pilot scale pelleting experiments were performed on non-treated, steam exploded and customized (adding steam exploded straw grinds in increments of 25 % to non-treated straw) barley, canola, oat and wheat straw grinds obtained from 6. 4, 3. 2, 1. 6 and 0. 8 mm hammer mill screen sizes at 10 % moisture content (wb). The pilot scale pellet mill produced pellets from ground non-treated straw at hammer mill screen sizes of 0. 8 and 1. 6 mm and customized samples having 25 % steam exploded straw at 0. 8 mm. It was observed that the pellet bulk density and particle density are positively correlated. The density and durability of agricultural straw pellets significantly increased with a decrease in hammer mill screen size from 1. 6 mm to 0. 8 mm. Interestingly, customization of agricultural straw by adding 25 % of steam exploded straw by weight resulted in higher durability (> 80 %) pellets but did not improve durability compared to non-treated straw pellets. In addition, durability of pellets was negatively correlated to pellet mill throughput and was positively correlated to specific energy consumption. Total specific energy required to form pellets increased with a decrease in hammer mill screen size from 1. 6 to 0. 8 mm and also the total specific energy significantly increased with customization of straw at 0. 8 mm screen size. It has been determined that the net specific energy available for production of biofuel is a significant portion of original agricultural biomass energy (89 - 94 %) for all agricultural biomass...|$|R

It is important to understand the fundamental mechanism of the biomass compression process, which is required in the design of energy efficient <b>compaction</b> <b>equipment</b> to mitigate the cost of pre-processing and transportation of the product. Therefore, a comprehensive review of various compression models was performed and the compression behavior of selected ground agricultural biomass was studied. Five compression models were considered to determine the pressure-volume and pressure-density relationship to analyze the compression characteristics of biomass samples, namely...|$|E

This paper focuses on characterizing the volumetric stiffness behavior of fine-grained subgrade soil at three different moisture states using a newly proposed hydrostatic compression test procedure. The deformation properties {{obtained from a}} laboratory testing program {{were used to determine}} bulk modulus at varying hydrostatic stress states, and moisture states chosen at optimum moisture content, 3 % below and 3 % above the optimum. The test results are analyzed, and used to develop regression correlation models for the soil sample tested. These models can be used for evaluating the impact of moisture on bulk modulus of fine-grained soils with similar characteristics for their sustainable use in foundation applications under off-road construction and <b>compaction</b> <b>equipment...</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction Roller-compacted {{concrete}} (RCC) {{construction was}} first {{considered as a}} low-cost, rapid construction alternative to earth and rockfill dams and is now considered {{a viable alternative to}} any conventional mass concrete that can be placed at sites providing sufficient space to accommodate spreading and <b>compaction</b> <b>equipment.</b> This Engineer Technical Letter (ETL) discusses the special problem areas and concerns related to RCC construction in order to assure that the concrete properties required are ultimately realized in the completed structure. A quality RCC product requires a coordinated effort between the structural designer, the materials engineer, the materials laboratory, and those responsible for field quality control and quality assurance. Additional detailed RCC materials information {{can be found in the}} American Concrete Institute (ACI) Committee 207 report 207. 5 R, "Roller Compacted Concrete" (Reference 12 a), and in Engineer Manual (EM) 1110 - 2 - 2006, "Roller Compacted C...|$|E
40|$|Noise induced {{hearing loss}} {{continues}} to afflict workers in many occupational settings despite longstanding {{recognition of the}} problems and well-known methods of prevention and regulations. The focus {{of this research was}} to determine the noise exposures of heavy construction equipment operators while documenting the workers" tasks, (i. e. hauling, moving, and/or pushing construction material). Time-motion studies were performed at the construction sites and were used to correlate the noise dosage with the work performed by the equipment operators. The cumulative dose for each operator was then plotted with references to work tasks. This was done to identify the tasks that caused the greatest noise exposure. Three construction sites were studied for this research. The types of construction equipment studied included asphalt pavers, backhoes, bulldozers, <b>compaction</b> <b>equipment,</b> excavators, haul trucks, telehandlers, and wheeled loaders. The results indicate that the majority of operators were over-exposed to hazardous noise...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Results from {{laboratory}} tests {{are reported to}} establish how pipe deflections, strains and local bending {{are influenced by the}} selection of backfill soil and its placement for two profiled thermoplastic culverts. Lined-corrugated high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes with a nominal inside diameter of 600 mm were tested in poorly graded sand and well-graded gravel backfills. The backfill was compacted using real <b>compaction</b> <b>equipment</b> and procedures, and then subjected to a maximum increase in vertical pressure of 200 kPa in a test cell that simulates deep burial. For the specific conditions tested, the largest deflections and strains were for the HDPE pipe when placed just above a rigid base and with uncompacted sand backfill placed below the springline, while local bending was greatest for the PVC pipe with well-compacted gravel backfill. A procedure is presented to account for the maximum local bending strain within a simplified design approach for profiled thermoplastic pipes using an empirical strain factor inferred from the measured results...|$|E
40|$|Compaction is an {{important}} operation for improving construction material stability in construction operations such as soils and asphalt pavement. Through the process of compaction, soil strength and stability can be increased to the magnitude required by the design. Quality control is an extremely important concern of State Highway Agencies and contractors. For asphalt pavements, performance and quality are affected by three primary factors: a properly designed mix, drainage, and adequate compaction. These three factors must be performed together to assure quality. For this reason, compaction {{is considered to be}} very important in the performance of asphalt pavements. This paper reports on research to develop a system to map the moving <b>compaction</b> <b>equipment,</b> transform this result into a geometrical representation, and to investigate the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to develop a graphical representation depicting the number of coverages. Results are stored in a permanent record that can serve as a historical document. ...|$|E
40|$|Value models, {{in form of}} {{economical}} optimization functions, {{are often}} proposed to frontload engineering design activities. However, literature argues that, when qualitative data and assumptions prevail, a qualitative assessment of the ‘goodness’ of a design is preferable against a numerical (and monetary-based) encoding of preferences. This paper explores how a model-based approach can support deliberation about value in cross-functional design teams. Emerging from case studies in the road <b>compaction</b> <b>equipment</b> industry, the paper analyzes preferences for value modelling support {{when it comes to}} iteratively translate customer desires into terms meaningful for engineering design decision-making. It further prescribes a framework for value-driven engineering design that considers the need to update the value model definition as far as new information become available in the process, moving from qualitative to quantitative. The findings highlight the role the proposed chain of value models plays in terms of providing a shared reference to stimulate value discussions across functions and organizational roles, which is something that does not naturally happen in the organization today.
