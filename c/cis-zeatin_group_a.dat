40|$|Purpose {{of review}} With the {{sequencing}} of several Streptococcus pyogenes (<b>group</b> <b>A</b> Streptococcus) genomes have come major advances {{in understanding the}} pathogenesis of <b>group</b> <b>A</b> Streptococcus-associated diseases. This review focuses on <b>group</b> <b>A</b> Streptococcus skin infections and summarizes data published in the English language medical literature in 2004 and 2005. Recent findings <b>Group</b> <b>A</b> Streptococcus shows enormous and evolving molecular diversity driven by horizontal transmission between <b>group</b> <b>A</b> Streptococcus strains and between <b>group</b> <b>A</b> Streptococcus and other streptococci. Acquisition of prophages accounts {{for much of the}} diversity, conferring both virulence through phage-associated virulence factors and increased bacterial survival against host defences. Studies of <b>group</b> <b>A</b> Streptococcus isolates outside the US also question the generalizability -of classic <b>group</b> <b>A</b> Streptococcus M serotype associations with specific disease entities such as acute rheumatic fever and necrotizing fasciitis. The distinction between throat and skin <b>group</b> <b>A</b> Streptococcus has become blurred. Although there have been few advances in treatment of <b>group</b> <b>A</b> Streptococcus skin infections, developments towards <b>group</b> <b>A</b> Streptococcus vaccines are promising. Summary The diversity of <b>group</b> <b>A</b> Streptococcus remains a challenge for vaccine development.
