5|$|Another World is a {{platform}} game, featuring a <b>control</b> <b>scheme</b> where the player uses either the keyboard, joystick or gamepad {{to make the}} protagonist run, jump, attack and perform other, situation-specific actions, such as rocking a cage back and forth. In the initial part of the game, the player's character Lester is unarmed. He is able to kick at small creatures, but is otherwise defenseless.|$|E
5|$|Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra {{commented that}} Robotrons success, along with Defender, {{illustrated}} that video game enthusiasts {{were ready for}} more difficult games with complex controls. Though {{not the first to}} implement it, Robotron: 2084s use of dual joysticks popularized the design among 2D shooting games, and has since been copied by other arcade-style games. The <b>control</b> <b>scheme</b> has appeared in several other titles produced by Midway Games: Inferno, Smash TV, and Total Carnage. Many shooting games on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network use this dual control design. The 2003 title Geometry Wars and its sequels also use a similar <b>control</b> <b>scheme.</b> The input design was most prominent in arcade games until video games with three-dimensional (3D) graphics became popular in the late 1990s. Jarvis attributes the lack of proliferation in the home market to the absence of hardware that offered two side-by-side joysticks. Most 3D games, however, use the dual joystick scheme to control the movement of a character and a camera. Few console games, like the 2004 title , use two joysticks for movement and attacking.|$|E
30|$|The rest of {{the paper}} is {{structured}} as follows. In ‘Methods’ section, ‘Problem description’ subsection introduces the problem studied in this paper; ‘Bearing-only controllers’ subsection presents two bearing-only-based <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> adapted from our previous work; ‘Range-only controllers’ subsection proposes two range-only-based <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> and proves their global stability for the two-robot case. These two <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> are then naturally extended to the multirobot case. In ‘Results and discussion’ section, Monte Carlo simulations are then carried out to test the convergence of the range-only-based <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> in multirobot systems. ‘Results and discussion’ section also discusses the experimental detail and results under the proposed <b>control</b> <b>schemes.</b> Concluding remarks are given in ‘Conclusions’ section.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Call {{admission}} <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> {{play more}} {{important role in}} wireless cellular networks. They are used for achieving some desired quality of service parameters. The design of call admission control algorithms for mobile cellular networks is especially challenging given the limited and highly variable resources, and the mobility of users encountered in such networks. This paper discusses different schemes for providing Quality of Service (QoS) in cellular networks. This paper provides a survey of admission <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> & Handoff Prioritization for cellular networks and the research in this area. Our goal {{is to provide a}} broad classification and thorough discussion of existing call admission <b>control</b> <b>schemes.</b> We describe several admission <b>control</b> <b>schemes.</b> Handoff is an essential element of cellular communications.

5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} remaster was mostly positive. Several critics {{noted that some}} features like the inventory system and the insistence on having to revisit previously explored areas have not aged very well, but generally agreed that the remaster was a solid revival of a classic. The new <b>control</b> <b>scheme</b> was also considered more intuitive and satisfying, especially for new players.|$|E
5|$|Robotron: 2084 was {{critically}} and commercially successful. Praise among critics {{focused on}} the game's intense action and <b>control</b> <b>scheme.</b> The game is frequently listed as one of Jarvis's best contributions to the video game industry. Robotron: 2084 arcade cabinets have since become a sought-after collector's item. It was ported to numerous platforms.|$|E
5|$|Super Monkey Ball {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised the simplicity and subtle depth of its <b>control</b> <b>scheme</b> {{as well as}} the new multiplayer modes not present in its arcade counterpart, although some felt its presentation was lacking. The game was commercially successful and remained one of Sega's best-sellers in the United States for much of 2002, eventually spawning a direct sequel, Super Monkey Ball 2, and an entire Super Monkey Ball franchise.|$|E
40|$|Virtual Path Bandwidth (VPB) {{control and}} Virtual Circuit Routing (VCR) control are {{competitive}} <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> for traffic management in ATM networks. The objective of both controls is {{to minimize the}} Call Blocking Probability (CBP) of the congested end-to-end links, under constraints posed by the transmission links capacity of the network. Firstly, we compare the performance of two VCR <b>control</b> <b>schemes,</b> the DAR and DCR, well-known in the environment of STM networks, considering several trunk reservation parameters and different control intervals. Secondly, we compare the performance of VPB <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> with that of VCR <b>control</b> <b>schemes,</b> both under static and dynamic traffic conditions. Under static traffic conditions {{the efficiency of the}} two <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> in minimizing the worst CBP of the network is examined, whereas under dynamic traffic conditions their response time is measured by the means of simulation. In few words, VPB control is more effective than VCR control when the traffic fluctuation is large while VCR control has a faster response time than VPB control...|$|R
40|$|Two {{adaptive}} <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> for nonlinear mechanical systems, {{proposed by}} Slotine and Li (1987, 1988) and Kelly (1990), are investigated, {{with emphasis on}} robustness for unmodeled dynamics. The investigation is performed along the following lines: select a system for testing the controllers, it must be possible to change the dynamics of this system easily,; design and tune the <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> for the system without unmodeled dynamics; and evaluate the tracking performance of the <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> for the system with unmodeled dynamics. The system used for designing and tuning the controllers is a {{two degrees of freedom}} manipulator, a XY-table, with two prismatic joints. The control task is to follow a periodic trajectory, e. g., a circle. Both adaptive <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> are based on a model, of which the parameters are adapted, and a feedback component, including PD action, for the remaining tracking error.

40|$|Abstract—A {{three-phase}} {{insulated gate}} bipolar transistor (IGBT) -based parallel active filter {{is used for}} current and/or voltage unbalance compensation. An instantaneous power theory is adopted for real-time calculation and <b>control.</b> Three <b>control</b> <b>schemes,</b> current <b>control,</b> voltage control, and integrated control are proposed to compensate the unbalance of current, voltage, or both. The compensation results of the different <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> in unbalance cases (load unbalance or voltage source unbalance) are compared and analyzed. The simulation and experimental results show that the <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> can compensate the unbalance in load current or in the voltage source. Different compensation objectives can be achieved, i. e., balanced and unity power factor source current, balanced and regulated voltage, or both, by choosing appropriate <b>control</b> <b>schemes.</b> Index Terms—current unbalance, voltage unbalance, nonactive power, current control, voltage control I...|$|R

In this paper, we present an architecture for multicast congestion <b>control</b> <b>schemes.</b> We identify three components that constitute this architecture: namely, the feedback consolidation mechanism, the round-trip time measurement mechanism, and the loss detection and timeout mechanism. We then show how these mechanisms can be implemented for both rate-based and window-based congestion <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> under various feedback topologies. Finally, we discuss the tradeoffs involved in these implementations when we use the different congestion <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> (rate-based vs. window-based) and feedback topologies. ...|$|R

5|$|Japanese {{magazine}} Famitsu {{praised the}} gameplay for being both fun and accessible for those {{not used to}} action games, with further praise going to the <b>control</b> <b>scheme.</b> Computer and Video Games, reviewing the Japanese version, praised the combat's versatility despite some faults, but found the puzzle elements tedious and criticized the camera. The gameplay was generally praised by Ponce despite some repeating puzzles and enjoyed both the extensive post-game content and level of challenge. In contrast, Fitch found combat repetitive, criticized the fact that enemies respawned after leaving each area, and found elements from the dungeon design to the relationship mechanics poorly implemented {{when compared to other}} similar Japanese titles. Despite this, he did enjoy the variety of dungeon designs and the mechanics employed in boss battles. Edwards praised the overall gameplay mechanics, particularly noting the chain's gameplay options and the game's difficulty curve, although he noted that the normal melee combat lacked sophistication when compared to other titles available at the time. Schilling felt that the Oraclos Chain mechanics helped keep the combat interesting in addition to challenging boss battles, but found standard combat repetitive. Raze echoed many of these sentiments, but found that repetitive enemy design and an awkward camera hampered the experience. Kemps found normal weapon combat boring when compared to the Chain, and felt that each available <b>control</b> <b>scheme</b> had advantages and drawbacks related to them. Hogarty enjoyed the boss battles, but found overall combat repetitive and faulted both the controls and the fixed camera.|$|E

5|$|Killer7 was Suda51's {{first game}} {{released}} outside Japan. It received polarized reviews {{due to its}} unconventional <b>control</b> <b>scheme</b> and complex noir plot. The game's score, visual style and thought-provoking story received wide praise from most critics as the best aspects {{of the game and}} lead to several accolades and nominations. While some reviewers appreciated the stripped-down controls and stylized arthouse approach, others panned it as confusing and restricting. Despite these setbacks, Killer7s cult appeal led to remakes of Suda51's older works and the successful launch of No More Heroes.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{statistical}} scheduling of offline subjective tests for evaluating alternative <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> in real-time multimedia applications. These applications {{are characterized by}} multiple counteracting objective quality metrics (such as delay and signal quality) that can be affected by various <b>control</b> <b>schemes.</b> However, the trade-offs among these metrics {{with respect to the}} subjective preferences of users are not defined. As a result, it is difficult to select the proper <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> that lead to the best subjective quality at run time. Since subjective tests are expensive to conduct and the number of possible <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> and run-time conditions is prohibitively large, it is important that a minimum number of such tests be conducted offline, and that the results learned can be generalized to unseen conditions with statistical confidence. To this end, we study in this paper efficient algorithms for scheduling a sequence of subjective tests, while leaving the generalization of limited offline subjective tests to guide the operation of the <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> at run time to a future paper. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we verify the robustness of our algorithms in terms of their accuracy and efficiency. I...|$|R
40|$|Several <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> {{specifically}} designed to operate inverter-based industrial microgrids during voltage sags have been recently proposed. This paper first classifies these <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> in three categories and then performs a comparative analysis of them. Representative <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> of each category are selected, described and used to identify the main features and performance of the considered category. The comparison {{is based on the}} evaluation of several indexes, which measure the power quality of the installation and utility grid during voltage sags, including voltage regulation, reactive current injection and transient response. The paper includes selected simulation results from a 500 kVA industrial microgrid to validate the expected features of the considered <b>control</b> <b>schemes.</b> Finally, in view of the obtained results, the paper proposes an alternative solution to cope with voltage sags, which includes the use of a static compensator in parallel with the microgrid. The novelty of this proposal is the suitable selection of the <b>control</b> <b>schemes</b> for both the microgrid and the static compensator. The superior performance of the proposal is confirmed by the analysis of the quality indexes. Its practical limitations are also revealed, showing that the topic studied in this paper is still open for further research...|$|R
