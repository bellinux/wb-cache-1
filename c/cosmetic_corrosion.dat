40|$|The {{effect of}} zinc and zinc alloy coated steel sheets on <b>cosmetic</b> <b>corrosion</b> and {{perforation}} corrosion in actual automobiles and the relevant corrosion mecha-nisms were studied. The main factor affecting <b>cosmetic</b> <b>corrosion</b> {{on the outside}} of outer panels was the coating weight of the Zn or Zn alloy coating rather than the type of coating. Perforation occurred in 6 – 7 years inside of door hems where Zn-rich primer coated steel panels were used, whereas perforation corrosion life was more than 14 years in galvanized steel sheets with a 120 g/m Zn coating weight in lapped side-sills. Measurements of the perforation depth and analysis of the composition of the iron rusts formed on automobile bodies in North America showed that the perforation corrosion process in hot-dip galvanized steel sheets can be divided into 4 stages. The period during which Zn corrosion products control corrosion of the steel substrate plays a very important role in determining the period until perfora-tion occurs in automobile bodies in regions where road deicing salt is used...|$|E
40|$|Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-Ray Microanalysis (EDS) {{have been}} used to {{investigate}} rapid detinning, pitting corrosion and <b>cosmetic</b> <b>corrosion</b> in plain tin plate food cans and pitting corrosion, underenamel corrosion, enamel flaking, sulfide black corrosion and stress corrosion cracking in enamelled food cans. Through the use of SEM - EDS it was determined that (SnL a /FeK a) Y 2 X -ray line intensities arc proportional to the tin coating weight on tinplate. The method was applied to a rapid detinning problem in canned grapefruit sections. The cause of the early corrosion failure was found to be reversed tinplate. An early pining corrosion failure in apple sauce packed in plain tinplate cans was re lated to use of tinplate sensitive to pin ing corrosion in combination with a product contain ing oxygen and nickel as corrosion accelerators. An internal rust ing <b>cosmetic</b> <b>corrosion</b> problem present on the inside tinplate ends of canned mushrooms was caused by exposed steel at lightly tinned surface ridges of tinplate reacting with moisture and oxygen in the product. An early pitting corrosion problem in carrots packed in enamelled cans was related to excessive metal exposure at the side seam weld and at various a reason the can body. An underenamel corrosion and enamel flaking problem in canned pet food was caused by the inadvertent use of black plate instead of tin free steel. A sulfide black corrosion problem on the tin free steel ends of canned minced clams may be related to enamel fracture. A stress corrosion cracking problem in canned pet food may be related to can coating integrity and copper residues in the product...|$|E
40|$|In this study, after a NiCr bond layer was {{deposited}} on a pearlitic, {{grey cast iron}} rotor disc of the kind used in a production passenger car (Toyota Corolla 1600 cc), Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr and Al 2 O 3 -TiO 2 powders were sprayed using High Velocity Oxygen Fuel(HVOF) and plasma spray processes, respectively. The discs were subjected to <b>cosmetic</b> <b>corrosion</b> test according to SAE J 2334 test standard. Additionally, wear tests were carried out using a reciprocating wear tester by rubbing a 10 mm diameter Al 2 O 3 ball on the specimens machined from rotor discs in salt solution.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} a {{study of}} performance failures in Autophoretic® (A-coat or AP) coatings. As AP is a proprietary process and coating material, limited research has been published regarding the field performance of this coating technique. The specific failure under analysis {{in this study was}} corrosion. The study was performed at the request of a manufacturer that was experiencing pre-mature failures in the field on product coated using this process and material. Prepared samples were evaluated using several analysis techniques including, BET Gas Absorption Testing, Optical Microcroscopy, FE-SEM, and Corrosion-Rate Analysis. Samples were subjected to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) – Surface Vehicle Standard, J 2334 <b>Cosmetic</b> Cyclical <b>Corrosion</b> Lab Test to accelerate the corrosion process, simulating long-term field conditions. Micro-cracks and pores were identified in the final finished surface that proved to be the point of origin of extensive corrosion that was the result of creep under the surface of the finish and ultimate delimitation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Due to {{oxidation}} and decarburization during {{heat treatment}} prior to hot stamping, various coating products {{have been developed}} in the last decades. Press-Hardened Steel (PHS) components for passenger cars are generally coated by aluminized or galvanized (GI) coatings. The aluminized coating presents a good formability at high temperature and permits forming and quenching components in the same press tools with a so called direct hot stamping method. Due to a strong cracking in the base material during direct hot stamping induced by liquid-metal embrittlement (LME), galvanized coated products must be pre-formed at low temperature and undergo heat treatment in separate press units. Moreover, the oxide scale formed on GI parts must be removed by abrasive blasting, whereas aluminized parts can be directly painted after hot forming. However, higher performance in corrosion resistance has been observed for galvanized parts, in particular in <b>cosmetic</b> and cut-edge <b>corrosion.</b> This increase {{is linked to the}} sacrificial effect or cathodic protection provided by the layer containing zinc. Daimler AG is investigating the possibility of improving performance of PHS body parts in terms of suitability for direct hot stamping and corrosion protection by developing new coating materials. In the following article, the main particularities and challenges involved in both current coating products will be introduced. The development of specific press tools for this study, as well as the corresponding simulation of hot forming will be presented. Finally, the hot forming behaviour and anticorrosive properties of both current products will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Develop a {{standardized}} <b>cosmetic</b> <b>corrosion</b> test for finished aluminum (Al) automotive body panels {{that provides a}} good correlation with in-service testing and field performance. Approach •	 Conduct laboratory testing, outdoor exposures, test-track exposures and in-service testing. •	 Evaluate test data to determine which accelerated tests correlate with in-service testing. •	 Conduct iterative laboratory testing to improve correlation between lab tests and on-vehicle exposures. Accomplishments •	 Initial laboratory tests, test-track exposures and outdoor exposures completed •	 On-vehicle tests have been exposed for three years out of five planned. •	 Corrosion product analyses conducted for some laboratory tests and for two-year exposures on-vehicles. •	 Round-robin testing conducted for the three lab tests down-selected from initial lab tests. •	 Conducted an initial evaluation of three existing ASTM tests with sulfur in the exposure. Future Direction •	 Modifications of the more promising accelerated laboratory tests are now being considered {{in an effort to}} find a lab test with improved correlation to on-vehicle exposure results in terms of the extent and morphology of the corrosion as well as the composition of the corrosion products. On-vehicle exposures will continue until the panels have been exposed on vehicles for five years. i- 38 Automotive Lightweighting Material...|$|E
