5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{consider the}} figures of Gullveig/Heiðr and Freyja the same. These conclusions have been made through comparisons between the figure of Gullveig/Heiðr's use of seiðr in Völuspá and the mention of Freyja introducing seiðr to the Æsir from the Vanir in Heimskringla. This is at times taken further that their <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Æsir led to the Æsir–Vanir War.|$|E
5|$|Reacting to Cruyff's departure, an {{independent}} protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall. The {{objective of the}} group, called L'Elefant Blau was to oppose the presidency of Núñez, which they regarded as a <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club's traditional values. Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> in <b>the</b> Latin American countries. Latin America is {{a region}} {{with a severe}} problem <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> {{but there are also}} countries in the region that diverge by having a relatively low level <b>of</b> <b>corruption.</b> <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study was to examine}} which factors can explain the differences in <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> in <b>the</b> region. On <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> a number of theories and previous research regarding <b>the</b> causes <b>of</b> <b>corruption,</b> this study examines which effects democratization, <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> democracy, decentralization, state intervention and social capital have on <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> in <b>the</b> Latin American countries. A quantitative method with simple linear regressions was used to find out if there are any significant linear relationships between these variables and <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>corruption.</b> <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study show a significant negative relationship between democratization and <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> in <b>the</b> Latin American countries. Countries with a more developed democracy tend to have lower levels <b>of</b> <b>corruption.</b> <b>The</b> other variables can not significantly explain the variance in <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> in Latin America. 2008 - 06 - 05 </p...|$|R

5|$|Although {{his suicide}} is often {{linked to the}} Foundation’s {{financial}} difficulties, the letter clearly shows Favaloro overwhelmed by the <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> health system and feeling {{that he could not}} fight against this powerful organization. In some parts of the letter, he refers to himself as “Don Quijote” in his lonely battle against the giants. Aggravating this situation was that Favaloro had never recovered from the death of his wife in 1998. Following her death, he had resolved to marry one of his longtime colleagues and coauthors, Diana Truden; she lived with Favaloro during his final days and was in his Palermo neighborhood house when he committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|At this juncture, the Roman empire was convulsed by {{its first}} major civil war since the Battle of Actium exactly a century earlier: the Year of the Four Emperors (69-70 AD). The {{governor}} of Germania Inferior, ordered {{to raise more}} troops, outraged the Batavi by attempting to conscript more Batavi than the maximum stipulated in their treaty. The brutality and <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman recruiting-centurions (including incidents of sexual assault on Batavi young men) brought already deep discontent in the Batavi homeland to the boil.|$|E
5|$|His {{influence}} can {{as well be}} seen in Ecuadorian {{thought in}} general, as his work {{has been one of}} its principal influences; Ecuadorian education, as he promoted new pedagogical ideas, such as the creation of good citizens instead of merely imparting knowledge, and finally Ecuadorian science, as he was, along with Pedro Vicente Maldonado, one of the two most important scientists of colonial Ecuador. Espejo analyzed the reality of colonial Quito, the poverty of its people and their lack of good education, and he denounced the <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonial authorities.|$|E
5|$|Loughor Castle was {{constructed}} {{on the western}} edge of the Welsh commote, or land unit, of Gwyr. The castle was built shortly after 1106, when Henry de Beaumont, the Earl of Warwick, was given the Gower Peninsula by Henry I. The Anglo-Norman colonisation of the region followed, with Gower becoming a Marcher territory, enjoying extensive local independence. Loughor Castle was strategically important because it controlled the main road running through Gywr from Beaumont's main base at Swansea Castle, and was a valuable coastal port. The castle took its name from a <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> title of the Roman fort.|$|E

5|$|Orr's first {{professional}} contract {{was one of}} the first in professional ice hockey to be negotiated by an agent. It made him the highest-paid player in NHL history as a rookie. His second contract was the first million-dollar contract in the NHL. However, after his retirement, Orr learned he was deeply in debt and he had to sell off most of what he owned. Orr broke with his agent Alan Eagleson and sued the Black Hawks to settle his contract. Orr and his family returned to Boston where Orr went into business to rebuild his finances. Orr aided the investigations that led to Eagleson's fraud convictions and disbarment. Orr also supported the lawsuit that exposed the <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NHL's pension plan.|$|E
5|$|The disquilibrium and {{perceived}} <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electoral and political process led, in 1966, to back-to-back military coups.

The coup plotters succeeded in murdering Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Premier Ahmadu Bello of the Northern Region and Premier Ladoke Akintola of the Western Region. But, the coup plotters struggled to form a central government. President Nwafor Orizu handed over government control to the Army, then {{under the command of}} another Igbo officer, General JTU Aguiyi-Ironsi.|$|E
5|$|The {{surviving}} {{members of}} the Cofradía de San José {{who lived in the}} vicinity of Mount San Cristobal and Mount Banahaw, continued with their religious activities and were known as colorums, a <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Latin phrase in saecula saeculorum ("unto the ages of ages") which was used at Mass to end prayers. During the American colonial era, the term colorum was applied to all the cults and insurgent groups characterized by Roman Catholic devotion, folk superstition, and hero worship. Some of these groups are still active today in various provinces in the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|After graduation, Brundage {{began work}} as a {{construction}} superintendent for the leading architectural firm of Holabird & Roche. In the three years {{he worked for the}} firm, he supervised the construction of $7.5million in buildings—3percent of the total built in Chicago in that time-frame. He disliked the <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chicago building trades. Brundage's biographer, Allen Guttmann, points out that the young engineer {{was in a position to}} benefit from influence if he had wanted to, as his uncle, Edward J. Brundage, was by then Republican leader of Chicago's North Side and would become Attorney General of Illinois. Brundage had been successful in a number of track and field events while at Illinois. In 1910, as a member of the Chicago Athletic Association (CAA), he finished third in the national all-around championships (an American predecessor of the decathlon), sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and continued training, aiming at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|On {{top of all}} {{the misery}} the Zoroastrians had to pay a heavy {{religious}} tax known as Jizya. Zoroastrian sources record the method of extracting this as designed to humiliate the dhimmi, the taxed person, who was compelled to stand while the officer receiving the money sat on a high throne. Upon receiving the payment, the officer gave the dhimmi a blow on the neck and drove him roughly away. The public was invited to watch the spectacle. Arab tax collectors would mock Zoroastrians for wearing Kushti and would rip it off, hanging the cord around the necks of the beleaguered faithful. Due to <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax officials, at times twice and even three times the official figure would be collected, because every intermediary had to receive his share. If the families could not afford paying the Jizya, their children were beaten and even tortured and their religious books were thrown in fire. That is how the term “the bookless” came about. Under the woeful conditions, some had to convert and {{there were those who}} declared themselves Muslims, picked up Islamic names, but in secret continued Zoroastrian practices. Today the latter group among the Zoroastrians is known as Jaddid. In response to persecution and segregation policies, the Zoroastrians community became closed, introverted, and static.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting a new revolutionary {{era in the}} European history {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution, the authors expressed sharp social criticism, castigating the <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church authorities, the idleness of the monasticism, and popular superstition. They also appealed for reform of the language, education, and change to the social mores as a way to overcome backwardness and to renew people's mentality with a more western view. They claimed that Greece is positioned within a Europe defined by the dynamics of political reforms from old and corrupt monarchical regimes to new republican communities. The modern innovative spirit of Geographia Neoteriki was also expressed in the use of a lively and malleable vernacular (Demotic) language with very few ties to the katharevousa, a more archaich form of Greek, which was commonly used by most Greek scholars of that time.|$|E

5|$|The Democratic nominee was Samuel J. Tilden, the Governor of New York. Tilden was {{considered}} a formidable adversary who, like Hayes, {{had a reputation for}} honesty. Also like Hayes, Tilden was a hard-money man and supported civil service reform. In accordance with the custom of the time, the campaign was conducted by surrogates, with Hayes and Tilden remaining in their respective home towns. The poor economic conditions made the party in power unpopular and made Hayes suspect that he might lose the election. Both candidates focused their attention on the swing states of New York and Indiana, as well as the three southern states—Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida—where Reconstruction governments still barely ruled, amid recurring political violence. The Republicans emphasized the danger of letting Democrats run the nation so soon after southern Democrats provoked the Civil War and, to a lesser extent, the danger a Democratic administration would pose to the recently won civil rights of southern blacks. Democrats, for their part, trumpeted Tilden's record of reform and contrasted it with the <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incumbent Grant administration.|$|E
5|$|The town's name {{derives from}} a <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Celtic word bol and the Old English word pool meaning a place near a pool or creek. Variants include Pool, Pole, Poles, Poll, Polle, Polman, and Poolman. The area around modern Poole has been {{inhabited}} {{for the past}} 2,500years. During the 3rd century BC, Celts known as the Durotriges moved from hilltop settlements at Maiden Castle and Badbury Rings to heathland around the River Frome and Poole Harbour. The Romans landed at Poole during their conquest of Britain in the 1st century and took over an Iron Age settlement at Hamworthy, an area {{just west of the}} modern town centre. In Anglo-Saxon times, Poole was included in the Kingdom of Wessex. The settlement was used as a base for fishing and the harbour a place for ships to anchor {{on their way to the}} River Frome and the important Anglo-Saxon town of Wareham. Poole experienced two large-scale Viking invasions during this era: in 876, Guthrum sailed his fleet through the harbour to attack Wareham, and in 1015, Canute began his conquest of England in Poole Harbour, using it as a base to raid and pillage Wessex.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of myths and legends {{associated}} with the origin of the name Delhi. One of them is derived from Dhillu or Dilu, a king who built a city at this location in 50BC and named it after himself. Another legend holds that the name of the city is based on the Hindi/Prakrit word dhili (loose) and that it was used by the Tomaras to refer to the city because the Iron Pillar of Delhi had a weak foundation and had to be moved. The coins in circulation in the region under the Tomaras were called dehliwal. According to the Bhavishya Purana, King Prithiviraja of Indraprastha built a new fort in the modern-day Purana Qila area for the convenience of all four castes in his kingdom. He ordered the construction of a gateway to the fort and later named the fort dehali. Some historians believe that the name is derived from Dilli, a <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hindustani words dehleez or dehali—both terms meaning 'threshold' or 'gateway'—and symbolic of the city as a gateway to the Gangetic Plain. Another theory suggests that the city's original name was Dhillika.|$|E
