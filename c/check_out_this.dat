25|$|In 2004, {{with almost}} five years passed since having {{released}} any official studio material, The Aquabats independently recorded and released the five-track EP Yo! <b>Check</b> <b>Out</b> <b>This</b> Ride! {{as an attempt to}} both satisfy the band's fanbase and serve as a potential demo to attract interest from record labels. As their first recording with only six members and no use of a horn section, Yo! <b>Check</b> <b>Out</b> <b>This</b> Ride! marked the most drastic shift yet in The Aquabats' sound, taking the band even further into keyboard-driven rock and new wave-influenced songwriting. This would also mark Deibert's final recording with the band, as he would officially retire from the group later in the year, reducing The Aquabats to a quintet.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2004, The Aquabats were signed to {{independent}} label Nitro Records and began work on a new studio album in the fall. Despite this fortuitous turn of events, the group were still uncertain of their future following their semi-hiatus and radical shift in line-up; Jacobs later admitted that the band spent the recording sessions under the belief that it could possibly be their last album. After several months of production and much online hype, The Aquabats released their fourth album Charge!! on July 7, 2005. Continuing with the direction set by Yo! <b>Check</b> <b>Out</b> <b>This</b> Ride!, Charge!! was a bold introduction to The Aquabats' new musical style of guitar-driven, new wave-influenced rock.|$|E
