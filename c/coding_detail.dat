40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the utility of}} linguistic features for automatically differentiating between children with varying combinations of two potentially comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders: autism spectrum disorder and specific language impairment. We find that certain manual codes for linguistic errors are useful for distinguishing between diagnostic groups. We {{investigate the}} relationship between <b>coding</b> <b>detail</b> and diagnostic classification performance, and find that a simple coding scheme is of high diagnostic utility. We propose a simple method to automate the pared down coding scheme, and find that these automatic codes are of diagnostic utility...|$|E
