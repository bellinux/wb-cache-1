If there were any delay in the other matter, they might get news, from Malacca or some of their trading {{stations}} in Sumatra, that the ship has been here and, in that case, they would guess that we are thinking of establishing a trading station, and might send and make their own terms with the tumangong. There can be no doubt that, if we open a free port here, it will do great damage to them, and divert a large portion of the eastern trade here; being so much more handy for all the <b>country</b> <b>craft</b> trading with Siam and China, besides having the advantage of avoiding the heavy dues demanded by the Dutch." ...|$|E

This I thought might be useful, as they would be sure to be called out, in case of an attack upon the Inquisition; and I prayed them to be as slow as possible in their movements, in case of any sudden alarm. This will account for the fact that none of them arrived upon the spot before we had finished our business, just now.|$|E
60|$|These sand-sharks (if we may {{be allowed}} the expression) {{separate}} the main channels, which are named respectively the Swin or King's channel, on the north, and the Prince's, the Queen's, and the South channels, on the south. The channel through which the Nora passed was the Swin, which, though not used by first-class ships, {{is perhaps the most}} frequented by the greater portion of the coasting and colliery vessels, and all the east <b>country</b> <b>craft.</b> The traffic is so great as to be almost continuous; innumerable vessels being seen in fine weather passing to and fro {{as far as the eye}} can reach. To mark this channel alone there was, at the time we write of, the Mouse light-vessel, at the western extremity of the Mouse sand; the Maplin lighthouse, on the sand of the same name; the Swin middle light-vessel, at the western extremity of the Middle and Heaps sand; the Whittaker beacon, and the Sunk light-vessel on the Sunk sand--besides other beacons and numerous buoys. When we add that floating lights and beacons cost thousands and hundreds of pounds to build, and that even buoys are valued in many cases at more than a hundred pounds each, besides the cost of maintenance, it may be conceived that the great work of lighting and buoying the channels of the kingdom--apart from the light-house system altogether--is one of considerable expense, constant anxiety, and vast national importance. It may also be conceived that the Elder Brethren of the Corporation of Trinity House--by whom, from the time of Henry VIII down to the present day, that arduous duty has been admirably performed--hold a position of the highest responsibility.|$|E

50|$|Slaves were huddled {{together}} in poorly ventilated slave ships and were sanctioned a daily ration of uncooked rice {{to eat with}} sea water. One-third or even half of such shipments of “pieces of human cargo”, as the Dutch called them, died in transit due to dehydration, gastro-intestinal problems and epidemics. Dutch physicians on board were not familiar with tropical diseases. Amputations, if needed during the voyage, were done by sawing off the limbs on a wooden peg on deck, and most such cases ended in death due to sepsis. After reaching their destination, rebellions and mutinies by slaves did occur. Some slaves ran away into the forests or by local <b>country</b> <b>craft</b> to abandoned islands and died there due to starvation.|$|E

50|$|Rug hooking {{as we know}} {{it today}} may have {{developed}} in North America, specifically along the Eastern Seaboard in New England in the United States, the Canadian Maritimes, and Newfoundland and Labrador. In its earliest years, rug hooking was a craft of poverty. The vogue for floor coverings in the United States came about after 1830 when factories produced machine-made carpets for the rich. Poor women began looking through their scrap bags for materials to employ in creating their own home-made floor coverings. Women employed whatever materials they had available. Girls from wealthy families were sent to school to learn embroidery and quilting; fashioning floor rugs and mats was never part of the curriculum. Another sign that hooking was the pastime of the poor is the fact that popular ladies magazines in the 19th century never wrote about rug hooking. It was considered a <b>country</b> <b>craft</b> in the days when the word country, used in this context, was derogatory. Today rug hooking or mat making as it is sometimes referred to has been labeled in Canada as a fine art.|$|E

An impressive looking hanging bridge, which attracts curious visitors from far and wide connects one of the better-known islands, Thimmankudru to the mainland. House Boats are in the backwaters of Hoode. The Hanging Bridge was constructed by 2 Karnataka Engineer NCC and the Bridge was named as Deepak in memory of a late NCC Cadet.
