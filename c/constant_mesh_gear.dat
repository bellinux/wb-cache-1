50|$|The {{engine was}} now {{supported}} at just three not four points using special rubber insulation to control noise and vibration. Rover's—as it was promoted— Easy-free gear change {{was a new}} 4-speed gearbox with <b>constant</b> <b>mesh</b> double-helical <b>gears</b> for 2nd and 3rd and a freewheel device with its control beside the driver. A further convenience was an optional extra power-controlled or automatic clutch. A Startix automatic engine starter was fitted. Startix was activated when the ignition was switched on and, in addition, operated automatically if the engine stalled. The new change-speed system meant gears might be changed after a slight easing of the accelerator without using the clutch yet making no noise. A knob on the instrument panel switched of the freewheel and returned the gearbox to orthodox. The half-elliptic spring on both axles are controlled by hydraulic shock-absorbers. The freewheel was to remain a feature of Rovers for more than 20 years.|$|R

Point-line <b>meshing</b> <b>gear</b> is a new-styled gear {{characterized}} by both easy manufacturing and divisibility of involute gears and high strength for contacting between convex and concave tooth profiles of a circular-arc gear. And contact strength of point-line <b>meshing</b> <b>gears</b> has improved by 1 ~ 2 times {{in comparison with}} involute gears, and bending strength of such gears has improved by approximately 15 %, while noise has decreased even by 5 ～ 10 dB (A). In addition, {{with the increase of}} load, noise will decrease by 3 ~ 4 dB (A). Only a few teeth or even 2 ~ 3 teeth are required for a pinion gear. There are single point-line <b>meshing</b> <b>gears</b> (equivalent to single arc <b>gear),</b> double point-line <b>meshing</b> <b>gears</b> (equivalent to double arc gear) and few-tooth point-line <b>meshing</b> <b>gears,</b> totaling three kinds, which are widely used in reducers for metallurgy, mining, craning, transport and chemical industries.

40|$|Signatures are on file in the Graduate School. iii Fluctuation in static {{transmission}} error is the accepted principal cause of vibration excitation in <b>meshing</b> <b>gear</b> pairs and consequently gear noise.

40|$|A {{series of}} bench top {{experiments}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of metallic debris being dragged through <b>meshing</b> <b>gear</b> teeth. A test rig that is typically used to conduct contact fatigue experiments was used for these tests. Several sizes of drill material, shim stock, and pieces of gear teeth were introduced and then driven through the meshing region. The level of torque required to drive the "chip" through the <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> was measured. From the data gathered, chip size sufficient to jam the mechanism can be determined. INTRODUCTION In some space mechanisms the loading can be so high that there is some possibility that a gear chip might be liberated while in operation of the mechanism [1 - 5]. Also, due to the closely packed nature of some space mechanisms and the fact that a space grease is used for lubrication, chips that are released can then be introduced to other <b>gear</b> <b>meshes</b> within this mechanism. In this instance, it is desirable to know the consequences of a gear chip entering in between <b>meshing</b> <b>gear</b> teeth. To help provide some understanding, a series of bench-top experiments was conducted to engage chips of simulated and gear material fragments into a <b>meshing</b> <b>gear</b> pair. One purpose of the experiments was to determine the relationship of chip size to the torque required to rotate the gear set through the mesh cycle. The second purpose was to determine the condition of the gear chip material after engagement by the <b>meshing</b> <b>gears,</b> primarily to determine if the chip would break into pieces and to observe the motion of the chip as the engagement was completed.

40|$|The thesis {{contains}} three {{papers that}} comprise {{studies of the}} dynamic behaviour of involute spur and helical gears, and one paper that describes a method to {{determine the influence of}} misalignment on the static helical gear tooth stress. In the first study, the influence of the contact ratio on the dynamic response of a spur gear was examined. The spur gear pair was modelled using a single degree of freedom model with a piecewise <b>constant</b> <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> stiffness. By adopting this <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> stiffness variation, the dynamic response can be solved analytically. Based on a stability analysis of the resulting dynamic transmission error, the proper contact ratio to use in order to avoid tooth separation near a specific critical rotational speed was determined. In the other two studies of the dynamic behaviour of a gear set, the contact and the load between the gear teeth were more thoroughly investigated. The position of the contact and the distance that the gear teeth must deform were determined for every time increment in the dynamic simulation. This method ensures that the load is properly modelled, even at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the meshing cycle. The technique was applied to a helical gear, which requires a 3 D-analysis when calculating the load distribution along the line of contact. Furthermore, this technique was applied to a spur gear set to study the influence of the elasticity of the bearings and the significance of the <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> friction on the dynamic response. In addition, a method to determine how a misalignment of the gear axes will affect the static gear tooth stress of a helical gear pair is presented. Due to the misalignment, the load distribution along the line of contact will be shifted and the maximum contact pressure and the maximum fillet stress will be affected. A tooth contact analysis to find the contact between two helical gear teeth and the distance that the gears have to deform is included in the thesis...|$|R
