If a charge is assigned to the vapor particles (in particular, if single ionization is assumed), then the surface charge density associated with adsorbed ions can be calculated as a function of pressure. In a later version of the model presented in the second paper, the submodel of the vapor phase is extended to include electrostatic interactions between vapor ions and adsorbed ones as well as the screening effect, at a given distance from the surface, of ions closer to the surface.

Organic electronics, which utilizes the electrical properties of organic materials in the active or passive layers, is an emerging technology that has received much attention. In conjunction with today 2 ̆ 7 s demands for new materials and devices, many technologies have emerged for developing organic electronics and consolidating applications and markets. An organic thin-film transistor is the essential device in this paradigm in addition to organic photodiodes and organic light emitting diodes. ^ This thesis presents advances made in design and fabrication of organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) using small-molecule organic semiconductors (pentacene, anthradithiophene, and their derivatives) as the active layer with record device performance. In this work OTFT test structures fabricated on oxidized silicon substrates were utilized to provide a convenient substrate, gate <b>contact,</b> and gate <b>insulator</b> for the processing and characterization of vapor-deposited organic materials and their transistors. By developing a gate dielectric treatment using silane coupling agents the performance and yield of pentacene OTFTs was improved and a field-effect mobility of larger than 2 cm 2 /V-s was achieved. Such device performance is comparable to a-Si:H TFTs and {{have the potential for}} electronic applications. ^ In addition, the first direct photolithographic process for top contacts to pentacene OTFTs on oxidized silicon with an acceptable performance (a field-effect mobility of 0. 3 cm 2 /V-s, an on/off current ratio of 10 7, and a subthreshold slope of 1 V/decade) was developed. The multiple layer photoresist process demonstrated the feasibility of creating source and drain metallic electrodes on vapor-deposited pentacene thin films with a resolution less than 10 μm. ^ Subsequently, solution-processed OTFTs were then investigated and high performance transistors, with field-effect mobilities 3 ̆e 1 cm 2 /V-s and an on/off current ratio of 106. 5, were developed with a processing-temperature of less than 90 °C. This record performance was obtained with devices based on triethylsilylethynyl anthradithiophene (TES ADT) and triisopropylsilylethynyl pentacene (TIPS pentacene). Chemically modified source and drain contacts and gate dielectric were used to achieve such device performance, a performance that is still limited by the contacts. The studies were extended to several solution deposition methods which included blade coating, bar coating, dip casting, and spin casting. In addition to the above two materials, the design and characterization of four synthesized organic semiconductors with substituted functional groups was carried out.

However, The harvesting of solar energy in a clean and sustainable fashion and the storage and transport of the electricity could be challenges precluding practical scaling up of solar energy applications. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using semiconducting materials is the most attractive approach of the solar energy applications because it efficiently converts solar energy, with high efficacy, to storable and transportable hydrogen fuel through an environmentally benign process (reaction with water and with hydrocarbon and oxygen as by-products). However, the good chemical and electrochemical stability and high overall energy conversion efficiency, in addition to low cost, are current challenges {{for the use of}} large scale PEC for practical and sustainable solar fuel production. The focus of this thesis is to develop economically competitive and efficient PEC water splitting cells by selecting low cost and earth abundant semiconductors and developing cheap and facile scalable processing for photoelectrode fabrication. Two systems, three dimensional branched nanowire heterostructures and metal coating enabled planar Si structures, are studied in details. This dissertation is structured in the following: after a briefly introduction of the principle of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting cells in chapter 1, TiO₂ nanowires and TiO₂/Si branched nanostructures are discussed in chapters 2 and 3. As a low cost material, TiO₂ nanowire structure is prepared by a hydrothermal method and further modified by different post growth treatments to improve light absorption and kinetic properties and investigated their effects on PEC water splitting performances. The results show that types and sequences of post growth treatments should be carefully considered to improve the properties and performances of TiO₂ NWs. Also, hierarchically heterogeneous integrated TiO₂/Si nanostructures such as core/shell and multibranched nanowire structures are fabricated by a combination of nanoimprint lithography, reactive ion etch, and hydrothermal reactions. The structures have increased surface area for enhanced light absorption and more reaction sites and short diffusion length of minority carriers for higher reaction rate. Their PEC performances and the associated charge transfer at heterojunction interface are studied showing that photo current of TiO₂/Si heterojunction structure is limited by the recombination at the TiO₂/Si junctions or the properties of TiO₂. In chapter 4, metal-Si (MS) and metal- insulator-Si (MIS) structures, which have been studied in photovoltaic cells, are employed to developed cost- effective and efficient Si-based photoelectrodes. Earth abundant Ni film is selected as an oxygen evolution electrocatlayst for PEC photoanode, which can provide a junction voltage and protect Si surface, and applied to MS and MIS structures to compare their PEC performances and investigate the effects of insulating layer.

Precise control of the geometry, composition and chemical properties enabled the NWs to be a potential building block in felds, like nanoelectronics, photonics, mechanical and biological systems or sensors [32]. The most intriguing consequence of such a material combination is the possibility to give raise to novel excitations and properties that none of the single device components originally possesses. Recently, intense activity was aimed at arti�cially creating topologically protected Majorana fermion states. Many proposals make use quasi-onedimensional (quasi- 1 D) low critical temperature superconductors (LTS) in <b>contact</b> with topological <b>insulators</b> or quasi-one-dimensional materials with strong spin-orbit interactions (InAs & InSb NWs). Efforts have been made to use unconventional barriers with LTS, which o�er a much better compatibility and therefore nominal better interfaces, thus limiting, by low critical magnetic felds and low gap energy, for instance, the range parameters necessary to observe MBSs. HTS are much harder to integrate with other systems, but present the advantage as higher critical temperature, gap energy and huge stability to the magnetic field. Device that combine semiconducting nanowires (InAs-NWs) with HTS exploit both superconducting properties available with ceramic HTS and the high-purity of InAs-NWs together with xviii Hybrid superconducting InAs-nanowire based nanojunctions xix the tunability of their transport. The NWs represent the conductive channel in a superconductor-semiconductor-superconductor �eld-e�ect transistor (SUFET) device architecture and provide an ideal mesoscopic system to study both quantum con�nement and interference e�ects at low temperature, which is a promising platform to develop novel quantum devices, and the limits of quantum suppression of superconductivity. Nanoscale ordering and phase transition in complex oxides, where the electrons self-organize in ways qualitatively di�erent from those of conventional metals and insulators, {{is one of the most}} outstanding problems in physics today, and studies of nanoscale devices may have a formidable impact on that. Mixing bottom-up and top-down nanofabrication approaches have allowed building Josephson junctions in non-suspended and suspended design. Sophisticate EBL techniques have been developed and aim to align the InAs-NWs. Design device on which the InAs-NWs are positioned in random and guided (Dielectrophoresis (DEP) technique) way are fabricated. The InAs-NWs show external native oxide shell that hampers the current ux trough the interface, reason that procedures that allow to remove the oxide and get a good transparency between InAs-NWs and superconductor has been developed. Currentvoltage measurements as function of the temperature show, for both designs, a critical current amplitude that increases when the temperature decrease. Novel insights on macroscopic superconducting coupling in extreme conditions imposed by the nanostructures have been derived. The nanotechnology platform developed for suspended LTS junctions has represented the starting point for the integration between YBCO, the most used HTS, and NWS. This is an extremely challenging, high risk but extremely rewarding activity. Many designs have been developed for this type of junction. Many nanofabrication problems due to the complex structure of YBCO unit cell have been solved. In order to minimize the YBCO damaging e�ects due to out-di�usion oxygen from unit cell the nanofabrication recipe developed includes two sessions of electron beam lithography (EBL), two e-resists (PMMA) baking steps at low temperature and for few minutes, one dry etching session performed at very low temperature and one fast wet etching Hybrid superconducting InAs-nanowire based nanojunctions xx step. Special design of devices that allows verifying electric shorts before the InAs-NWs deposition have been developed. Innovative superconducting hybrid devices InAs-NWs/YBCO have been characterized with electric transport measurements as function of temperature and show as a current injected into YBCO banks can through the InAs-NWs that works as a weak link.

The �rst achievement of my work is that junctions YBCO/ suspended InAs-NW/YBCO of length � 200 nm are not insulating. Current passes through the InAs-NWS, demonstrating the feasibility of the whole fabrication process. The other encouraging result is that di�erently from InAs-NWs/Aluminium junctions resistance behavior observed for InAs- NW/YBCO devices depends on the normal length (L) of junction [43]. The work is structured in seven chapters. The �rst chapter is dedicated to a review of the general mechanisms of the electric transport in the normal state. In the second chapter an introduction to superconductivity and to the concept of Josephson coupling have been discussed.
