40|$|The {{precooler}} vacuum system, {{as proposed}} by FNAL, {{is based on a}} suitable modification of the existing Electron <b>Cooling</b> <b>Ring</b> System. Because of the magnetic cycle of the bending magnets, distributed ion pumping, as exists in the Electron <b>Cooling</b> <b>Ring,</b> is not applicable. Instead, the proposed pumping will be done with commercial appendage ion pumps mounted approximately every two meters around the circumference of the ring. The loss of effective pumping speed and non-uniformity of system pressure with appendage pumps may not be major considerations but the large number required does effect experimental and analytical equipment placement considerations. There is a distributed pumping technique available which: (1) is not affected by the magnetic cycle of the bending magnets; (2) will provide a minimum of four times the hydrogen pumping speed of the proposed appendage ion pumps; (3) will require no power during pumping after the strip is activated; (4) will provide the heat source for bakeout; (5) is easily replaceable; and (6) can be purchased, installed, and operated at a generous economic advantage over the presently proposed ion pumped system. The pumping technique referred to is non-evaporable gettering with ST 101 Zr/Al pumping strip.

For a beam with n = 10 π mm, as in several current designs, the kicker energy and voltage are both far higher than in any conventional kicker.

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} stability of intense, low momentum spread ion beams {{is of great}} interest today, especially in electron-cooled storage rings. Stability conditions are usually formulated as the limitations on the allowed value of beam-chamber coupling impedances.

The effect of the electron cooling can be described by the Fokker-Planck equation.

40|$|New {{physics is}} being {{explored}} with the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and with Intensity Frontier programs at Fermilab and KEK. The energy scale for new physics {{is known to}} be in the multi-TeV range, signaling the need for a future collider which well surpasses this energy scale. We explore a 10 ^ 34 cm^- 2 s^- 1 luminosity, 100 TeV pp̅ collider with 7 × the energy of the LHC but only 2 × as much NbTi superconductor, motivating the choice of 4. 5 T single bore dipoles. The cross section for many high mass states is 10 times higher in pp̅ than pp collisions. Antiquarks for production can come directly from an antiproton rather than indirectly from gluon splitting. The higher cross sections reduce the synchrotron radiation in superconducting magnets and the number of events per beam crossing, because lower beam currents can produce the same rare event rates. Events are more centrally produced, allowing a more compact detector with less space between quadrupole triplets and a smaller β^* for higher luminosity. A Fermilab-like p̅ source would disperse the beam into 12 momentum channels to capture more antiprotons. Because stochastic cooling time scales as the number of particles, 12 <b>cooling</b> <b>ring</b> sets would be used. Each set would include phase rotation to lower momentum spreads, equalize all momentum channels, and stochastically cool. One electron <b>cooling</b> <b>ring</b> would follow the stochastic cooling rings. Finally antiprotons would be recycled during runs without leaving the collider ring by joining them to new bunches with synchrotron damping. Comment: 11 pages, 20 figures, SESAPS 2015 Conference.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} work, a finite {{difference}} model (FDM) is built {{to predict the}} transient temperature field of the aluminum billet in the gradient cooling process. The billet is divided in 5 segments, {{each of which is}} corresponding with one water <b>cooling</b> <b>ring,</b> and all of which are water-cooled for different times respectively in order to obtain the target temperature gradient. On the following air cooling stage, the temperature of the outer layers, especially the surface, rises first, then falls slowly. With the rising of the surface temperature, the temperature deviation from the center to the surface is narrowed intensively. In comparison with the commercial finite element method (FEM) software, Deform 3 D, the FDM model gets nearly the same prediction results as FEM simulation does...|$|E

In 2002 the AD gave beam during more than 1900 h to its three experiments (ASACUSA, ATHENA and ATRAP) with beam properties meeting, and often exceeding design specification. Stochastic cooling with cool-down times of 18 s works as aimed for in the design. Electron cooling using the "old LEAR cooler" reaches the very small equilibrium emittances required but still takes more time (12 s instead of 6 s anticipated in the 1996 design).

The details of the tracking studies of both channels are presented and compared to the performance of the original RFOFO <b>cooling</b> <b>ring</b> design. 1. RFOFO <b>Cooling</b> <b>Ring</b> In a Muon Collider design the muon beam 6 D phase space volume must be reduced several orders of mag-nitude {{in order to be able}} to further accelerate it. Ion-ization cooling is currently the only feasible option for cooling the beam within the muon lifetime (τ 0 = 2. 19 µs). The RFOFO ring [1, 2] is one of the feasible op-tions currently under active investigation along with other designs [3, 4, 5]. The RFOFO ring provides a significant reduction in the six-dimensional emittance in a small number of turns with a relatively low par-ticle loss factor. 6 D cooling is achieved by employing the concept of emittance exchange. When a disper-sive beam passes through a wedge absorber in such a way that higher momentum particles pass through more material, both the longitudinal and the trans-verse emittances are reduced. However, the design of the injection and extraction channels and kickers is very challenging for the RFOFO, and the ring could not be used as is because the bunch train is too long to fit in the ring. Both problems would be removed in the RFOFO helix, also known as the Guggenheim channel [6]. In addition, using the helix solves an-other important issue, namely, the overheating in the absorbers. The main parameters of the original RFOFO design are summarized in Table I and compared to the pa-rameters of the Guggenheim channel. The layout of the RFOFO ring is shown in Fig. 1.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} design is presented for the 50 Tesla superconducting solenoids {{that are required}} for an optimized fast <b>cooling</b> <b>ring</b> in current designs for multi-TeV muon colliders. The solenoid utilizes high-performance multifilament Bi- 2212 /Ag round strand. The conductor is a cable-in-conduit consisting of six such strands cabled around a thin-wall spring tube then drawn within an outer sheath. The spring tube and the sheath are made from high-strength superalloy Inconel. The solenoid coil comprises 5 concentric shells supported independently in the conventional manner. Each shell consists of a winding of the structured cable, impregnated in the voids between cables but empty inside so that the spring tubes decouple stress so that it cannot straindegrade the fragile strands, and a high-E stress shell. An expansion bladder is located between the winding and the stress shell. It is pressurized and then frozen to provide hydraulic compressive preload to each shell.

40|$|Using {{smoothed}} particle hydrodynamics, we numerically simulate {{steady state}} accretion discs for Cataclysmic Variable Dwarf Novae {{systems that have}} a secondary-to-primary mass ratio (0. 35 < q < 0. 55). After these accretion discs have come to quasi-equilibrium, we rotate each disc out of the orbital plane by (δ = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5,) or (20) ^o) to induce negative superhumps. For accretion discs tilted 5 ^o, we generate light curves and associated Fourier transforms for an atlas on negative superhumps and retrograde precession. Our simulation results suggest that accretion discs need to be tilted more than three degrees for negative superhumps to be statistically significant. We also show that if the disc is tilted enough such that the gas stream strikes a disc face, then a dense <b>cooling</b> <b>ring</b> is generated near the radius of impact. In addition to the atlas, we study these artificially tilted accretion discs to find the source to negative superhumps. Our {{results suggest that the}} source is additional light from innermost disc annuli, and this additional light waxes and wanes with the amount of gas stream overflow received as the secondary orbits. The nodes, where the gas stream transitions from flowing over to under the disc rim (and vice versa), precess in the retrograde direction.

40|$|The {{existing}} electron cooler at COSY is {{a conventional}} device with energies up to 100 keV. At present, {{it is used}} at injection energy to prepare low-emittance proton or deuteron beams for external experiments or to increase the cooled beam intensity by stacking. Stochastic cooling is used to compensate emittance and momentum spread growth in internal experiments. Since the present stochastic cooling system is limited by its finite bandwidth to relatively low beam intensities (~ 1010 particles) and not too high target densities (~ 1014 atoms/cm 2), a future cooling device for high-luminosity experiments could be a Medium Energy Electron Cooling (MEEC) system. MEEC systems are being discussed since a few years: • Traditional single-pass schemes with electrostatic acceleration up to the required energy. At Fermilab a 5 MeV system is under construction. First tests are underway [1]. • Multi-traversal schemes, where the same electron beam, stored in a solenoidal ring, is used many times for cooling before it is dumped and a fresh electron beam is produced. The electron beam is prepared at low energy and accelerated either externally by a linac or internally by a beam transformer [2]. Only {{little is known about}} such schemes and they are not proven experimentally anywhere. The traditional single-pass system can provide electron beams with sufficiently low transverse and longitudinal temperatures, but HV problems, size and costs increase dramatically with electron energy. The multi-traversal scheme is more compact and probably less expensive.
