5|$|Rosenberg {{was granted}} {{a room in the}} palace to use for fortune telling, which the king made sure was stocked with alcohol, as they enjoyed {{drinking}} together. In late January, the king appointed Rosenberg as a customs appraiser in Honolulu, although the appointment was controversial; by mid-February he was fired by the head of customs. One month later, Rosenberg was reappointed by order of the king and the following month the head of customs resigned. Archibald Scott Cleghorn, the king's brother-in-law, was appointed as the new head of customs. Between March and May 1887, Rosenberg was paid $300, ostensibly for working as a guard at the <b>Customs</b> <b>Office,</b> although it was alleged that Rosenberg's position was a sinecure.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the opening}} of the Erie Canal in 1823, Pultneyville, New York, at the mouth of Salmon Creek, was Wayne County's only port. From about 1811 through the 1890s (when the <b>customs</b> <b>office</b> closed), {{shipping}} in this small hamlet extended to the Atlantic Ocean and the world via the Saint Lawrence River. During {{the early years of the}} 19th century, activity in Pultneyville focused on agricultural commerce from the surrounding region (as far south as Canandaigua) and the maritime trade on the Great Lakes. In 1865, it was home to nearly 30 lake captains, and many sailors from both Pultneyville and Sodus Bay crewed on whalers around the world. In 1874 the first railroad appeared when the Lake Shore Railroad line opened and the center of trade moved three miles (5km) south to Williamson and Pultneyville's significance as a commerce center sharply declined.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the year, however, Santa Anna {{began to}} exhibit centralist tendencies, and in 1835 he revoked the Constitution of 1824 and began {{consolidating}} his power. In various parts of the country federalists revolted, and in May 1835 Santa Anna brutally crushed a revolt in Zacatecas; over 2000noncombatants were killed. The federalists, including Agustín Viesca, the governor of Coahuila y Tejas, were afraid that Santa Anna would march against Coahuila after subduing the rebels in Zacatecas, so they disbanded the state legislature on May 21, 1835, and authorized the governor to set up an office in {{a different part of the}} state. Viezca was arrested as he traveled to San Antonio. Under the pretext of being angry over Viezca's imprisonment the people of Anahuac organized a resistance under Travis. In actuality, they were angry that the two-year grace period on tariffs had ended and the Anahuac <b>customs</b> <b>office</b> had reopened. When Viezca escaped and reached Texas, no one recognized him as governor.|$|E

The fair attracted 150,000 visitors that year, with tram connections to the city, <b>customs</b> <b>office</b> and telephone exchange on site. Also in 1928, a similar trade fair was launched in Wilno (now Vilnius, Lithuania) to drum up business in northeastern Poland, reaching out to Lithuania and Latvia. The Northern Trade Fair (Targi Północne) was visited by the staggering 180,000 guests in the first year. It was the biggest annual event locally showcasting textiles, furniture, farm animals, furs, tourist equipment, production machinery and many other commercial products.|$|E
25|$|On 27 August 1918, {{at about}} 4:10 pm, a gun battle erupted unintentionally when a {{civilian}} Mexican carpenter named Zeferino Gil Lamadrid attempted {{to pass through}} the border back to Mexico, without having the bulky parcel he was carrying with him inspected at the United States Customs house. As Gil Lamadrid passed the <b>customs</b> <b>office,</b> Customs Inspector Arthur G. Barber ordered him to halt, suspecting that Gil Lamadrid was smuggling weapons. Only a few feet away, Mexican customs officers led by Francisco Gallegos directed him to ignore the summons and stay put in Mexico. Gil Lamadrid became confused and hesitated as the two groups of customs agents shouted instructions to him. At this point Pvt. William Klint of the US 35th Infantry raised his Springfield rifle in an effort to force Gil Lamadrid to return to the US. In the midst of the ensuing commotion, a shot was fired, although by whom remains unclear, and the battle of Ambos Nogales commenced.|$|E
25|$|The Tokugawa shogunate {{dispatched}} Shibata Takenaka as magistrate of Hyōgo, {{putting him}} {{in charge of the}} creation of port and foreign settlement. Shibata immediately took over this task on his arrival in Kōbe-mura, but by January 1, 1868, when the port was to open, all that was complete was the <b>customs</b> <b>office,</b> three wharfs, and three storehouses. This was also the period during which the government transitioned from the shogunate to the Meiji government, and on November 9, 1867, Shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu officially tendered his resignation to the emperor. At first, business related to the port was left to the shogunate government, but on January 3, two days after the port opened, the shogunate was completely abolished and power returned to the emperor. After the shogunate forces lost the Battle of Toba–Fushimi {{at the end of that}} January, Yoshinobu retreated from Osaka Castle to Edo, and with Shibata recalled to Edo as well, the construction had to be suspended. The remainder of the construction was carried out under the Meiji government, and around 1872 the building of roads and drains was finished, completing the 8-by-5 grid of streets that defined the area of the settlement.|$|E
