2500|$|The second {{protective}} {{group in}} 26 (acetal, acid hydrolysis) was reconverted to the ketone in 27. The monooxime 28 (at the more hindered ketone group) was synthesised from the dioxime by selective hydrolysis (nitrous acid / acetic acid [...] ). The new nitrogen atom {{is also the}} second nitrogen atom required for the AD building block. Both the <b>cyclopentene</b> ring and the cyclohexenone ring were oxidized next in an ozonolysis (ozone) forming triketone 29, an aldol condensation of the 1,5-dicarbonyl unit (pyrrolidine acetate) formed cyclohexene 30 with tosylation of the oxime group, a second oxidation with periodic acid cleaves the cyclohexene ring and diazomethane esterifies the resulting carboxylic acid group in 31. A Beckmann rearrangement (methanol, sodium polystyrene sulfonate 2 hrs, 170°C) took place next to lactam 32 (not isolated) which reacted further to the tetracycle 33 called alpha-corrnorsterone in an amine-carbonyl condensation - aldol condensation cascade. This compound resisted [...] ring-opening of the lactam group due to incorrect stereochemistry of the propionic ester side-chain. The alpha compound was therefore converted its epimer 34 by first equilibrating in excess base followed by reacidifiying and diazomethane treatment. This epimer was then converted to the 35 by the simultaneous action of methanol and thiophenol. This ensured the differentiation of what will become the imidazole tail. [...] The [...] Ozonolysis gave aldehyde 36 with ammonia converting the thioester into an amide group and aldehyde reduction (sodium borohydride) followed by mesylation and bromination (lithium bromide) gave the bromide 37 with conversion of the amide group into a nitrile group as the completed AD section.|$|E

40|$|Five-membered carbocycles are key {{structures}} {{which are}} present in a large range of biologically important targets. The development of methodologies {{for the construction of}} these systems is thus a fundamental and important issue in organic chemistry. Accordingly, recent years show a growing interest {{in the development of a}} (4 + 1) strategy toward five-membered carbocycles. Most reported (4 + 1) cycloaddition strategies towards five-membered carbocycles involve addition of carbenes onto 1, 3 -dienes or vinylketenes. The high reactivity of carbenes is however responsible for a low functional group tolerance. In order to contribute to the development of an effective and general (4 + 1) annulation strategy, we decided to investigate the reaction between 1, 3 -diene and sulfur ylide. Indeed, sulfur ylides are known to react as carbenoids. In addition, they are easy to handle and compatible with most functionalities. In the event, we found that sulfonium ylides react with electron poor 1, 3 -dienes to lead selectively to the corresponding vinylcyclopropanes, with no traces of <b>cyclopentenes.</b> However, we found that rearrangement of these vinylcyclopropanes into <b>cyclopentenes</b> proceeds smoothly in the presence of a catalytic amount of magnesium iodide. A one-pot process of this methodology has been successfully developed. The use of chiral sulfonium ylides allows generating <b>cyclopentenes</b> with excellent enantiomeric excesses.
