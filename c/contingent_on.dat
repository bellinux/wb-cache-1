5|$|Although Sports Night was {{critically}} acclaimed, ABC {{canceled the}} show after two seasons {{due to its}} low ratings. Sorkin entertained offers to continue the show on other television channels but declined all the offers as they were mainly <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> his involvement {{which would have been}} a difficult prospect given that he was simultaneously writing The West Wing at that point.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its cancellation, two episodes of Better Off Ted had yet to be {{broadcast}} by ABC. The network announced on May 27, 2010, that it would air the two episodes back-to-back on June 17, 2010, <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> the 2010 NBA Finals not requiring a seventh game. Ultimately, however, a seventh game was needed, and thus ABC did not air the final two episodes of the series.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, an {{extensive}} sales {{arrangement of the}} Su-27M to China has been discussed. Sukhoi officials, in 1995, announced their proposal to co-produce the Su-27M with China, <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> Beijing's agreement to purchase 120 aircraft. However, it was alleged that the Russian Foreign Ministry blocked {{the sale of the}} Su-27M and Tupolev Tu-22M bomber over concerns about the arrangements for Chinese production of the Su-27.|$|E

5|$|In March 2014, Markus and McFeely {{stated that}} Howard Stark {{would be a}} {{recurring}} character, <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> Dominic Cooper's involvement. In June 2014, Atwell confirmed that Cooper would be involved with the series. Kyle Bornheimer, Ralph Brown, Meagen Fay, Lyndsy Fonseca, and Bridget Regan also recur as Ray Krzeminski, Johann Fennhoff, Miriam Fry, Angie Martinelli, and Dottie Underwood, respectively, throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 1943, {{orders for}} 100 {{production}} FR-1s were placed, with a follow-up order of 1,000 additional fighters in January 1945. All of the contracts were <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> the aircraft successfully completing carrier trials. Only 66 Fireballs were completed by November 1945 as orders for 1,044 FR-1s were canceled on VJ Day.|$|E
5|$|Per {{the base}} specification, any device {{attached}} to an SDP must initially be a low-power device, with high-power mode <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> later USB configuration by the host. Charging ports, however, can immediately supply between 0.5 and 1.5A of current. The charging port may apply current limiting or shut down completely, but must not apply limiting below 0.5A, and must not shut down below 1.5A or before the voltage drops to 2V.|$|E
50|$|The posse {{positioned}} {{itself on}} bluffs {{southwest of the}} fort, with <b>contingents</b> <b>on</b> the flats {{to the east and}} the west. They situated cannons on two small ridges looking directly into the fort, which in order to accommodate the hundreds of followers was really a makeshift enclosure. A militia from Ogden positioned itself to the north.|$|R

On March 2003, the 1st Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, deployed a 35-soldier platoon to serve alongside already deployed units from Operation Apollo. The platoon was replaced in July by a Royal Canadian Horse Artillery platoon.|$|R
5|$|Stark {{began to}} move his force to Hog Island at about 10 am and {{directed}} most of his men to round up livestock there while he forded Crooked Creek to Noddle's Island {{with a group of}} thirty men. Stark's small <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> Noddle's Island scattered into small groups, killed the animals they could find, and set fire to haystacks and barns.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} veterans' organisations, HIAG campaigned for the {{immediate}} amnesty and early release of war criminals still in Allied captivity. This issue was significant, as most of these organisations made their cooperation {{in the area of}} rearmament <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> the satisfactory resolution in this area. It was partly for this reason that the West German government was sympathetic to the fate of these individuals and made every effort to secure their early release. Chancellor Adenauer even met with Kurt Meyer in Werl Prison when he went there on an inspection tour.|$|E
5|$|Astana was {{at first}} not invited to the Giro. Six days before the race began, RCS Sport (the {{organizers}} of the Giro) went back on the decision to exclude Astana and extended them a late invitation. This change of heart was at least partly <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> Contador, Leipheimer, and Klöden participating in the race. Having thought for two months prior {{that they would not}} compete in the Giro, most of Astana's riders had planned to take a break during the Tour of Italy, and Contador was actually vacationing on a beach when Bruyneel called him to tell him the team was headed to the Giro.|$|E
50|$|Members of the {{regiment}} have augmented Regular Force <b>contingents</b> <b>on</b> many operations including {{serving in the}} Balkans with United Nation forces (UNPROFOR) in the early 1990s and NATO from 1995-present. Over the past decades members have also served in; Cyprus, the Golan Heights, Bosnia, Sierra Leone, Congo, Haiti, Sudan, Dubai, Afghanistan, Kuwait, and Iraq. They were also on alert for the feared millennial or Y2K crisis which failed to materialise.|$|R
50|$|The 3 PPCLI Battle Group {{returned}} home {{after six months}} of service in Afghanistan. The redeployment was announced on June 21, 2002, and the troops arrived back in Canada in two <b>contingents</b> <b>on</b> July 28 and July 30. This troop movement was co-ordinated with the scheduled rotation of American troops to permit the 3 PPCLI Battle Group to travel by American airlift, reflecting Canada's lack of any strategic lift capability.|$|R

5|$|Behaviorists {{focus on}} the {{acquisition}} and teaching of delayed gratification, and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay. Behavior analysts capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> the person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of gratification. It {{is important to note}} that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, the reward must have some value to the participant. Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior.|$|E
5|$|Chaltin's column {{advanced}} north {{with the}} Nile river protecting his right flank and the Azande cavalry <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> his left. At seven o'clock, Belgian scouts sighted the two-thousand strong Mahdist force assembled along a two-mile line that spanned {{a range of}} hills between the Nile and a parallel river. There was one clear path through the hills, which was especially well defended. Commandant Chaltin brought forward five companies for the attack, leaving his remaining three in reserve.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, Bradley {{became a}} {{page in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives. He studied law under his father, one of Kentucky's leading {{criminal}} defense lawyers. Although Kentucky law required that anyone taking the bar examination be at least twenty-one years old, Bradley was allowed by a special provision of the state legislature to take it at age eighteen. This arrangement was <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> Bradley's being judged competent by two circuit judges. Despite having no college education, Bradley passed the exam and was licensed in 1865, joining his father's firm in Lancaster. He later received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Kentucky University (now Transylvania University).|$|E

40|$|An {{economic}} model is {{proposed for the}} analysis of quantum and revenue hedges, and prices of <b>contingent</b> claims <b>on</b> revenue and quantum are presented and discussed. In particular we discuss how one can use futures, and futures options markets for quantum, and combine these with a similar market for future contracts on price, in order to hedge revenue. An example of <b>contingent</b> claims <b>on</b> quantum is given by area yield futures and options traded at the CBoT...|$|R
5|$|Neville {{supported}} the king during the Becket controversy between {{the king and}} Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury and was excommunicated by the archbishop twice. One excommunication occurred when Neville imprisoned one of Becket's chaplains, William of Salisbury, for six months in Corfe Castle in connection with Becket's actions against the king. Neville was absolved from this excommunication by Gilbert Foliot, the Bishop of London, after Neville decided to go on crusade. Becket was angered by the bishop's action, even though Foliot made the absolution <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> Neville getting a penance from the pope {{on his way to}} the Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2002, ABC aired Nancy Drew, {{starring}} Maggie Lawson {{and produced}} by Lawrence Bender. The movie {{was intended to}} be a pilot for a possible weekly series, which saw Nancy and her friends going off to college in a modern setting. Like the 1930s films, this pilot also took a more mature turn. The pilot aired as part of The Wonderful World of Disney series, with additional scripts being ordered and production <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> the movie's reception. The series was passed at ABC, and UPN also passed following Lawson being cast on another series.|$|E
5|$|The new Form of Government {{was much}} more {{acceptable}} to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. They passed it on 10February 1645, <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> some particularities of presbyterian government which {{were expected to be}} worked out in a forthcoming Directory for Church Government. At the same time they announced their desire to formally unite the two churches. Following the rise of Cromwell and the secret Engagement of some Scots with Charles this hope was abandoned, and the documents were never formally adopted. The General Assembly ceased to function under Cromwell and the kings who succeeded him from 1649 to 1690.|$|E
5000|$|Naval Station Rota, {{also known}} as NAVSTA Rota, [...] (Base Naval de Rota), is a Spanish naval base {{commanded}} by a Spanish Rear Admiral and fully funded by the United States of America. Located in Rota in the Province of Cádiz, {{near the town of}} El Puerto de Santa María, NAVSTA Rota is the largest American military community in Spain and houses US Navy and US Marine Corps personnel.

5|$|In November 2013, UNSOA (United Nations Support Office for AMISOM) was {{required}} by the UNSC to support the SNA across South Central Somalia. Their mandate consisted in consolidating and training a force of 10,900 Somalis, officially to fight al Shabab forces. The SNA force would initially be trained by the AMISOM <b>contingents.</b> <b>On</b> the passing of specific UN requirements, designated SNA battalions would then participate in joint operations with AMISOM. UNSOA's support during the period comprised food supplements, shelter, fuel, water and medical support.|$|R

5|$|The rebels had {{previously}} been completely disinherited, and their land taken into the king's hands. The Dictum instead extended a pardon, and restored land to their previous owners, <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> payment of certain penalties that were proportional {{to the level of}} involvement in the rebellion. It was traditional to value land at ten times its annual yield, and most of the rebels were subsequently fined at half of this amount: five times the annual yield of their lands.|$|E
5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person {{will be willing to}} pay anything for a good if the alternative is death. For example, a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, no matter how much, for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> the price.|$|E
5|$|Before {{his death}} in 1107, Richard the abbot of Ely had {{attempted}} to secure from the papacy the elevation of his abbey into a bishopric. After Richard's death, Hervey was appointed to oversee the abbey during the vacancy. He convinced the monks of Ely to support Richard's project, which received the conditional approval of Archbishop Anselm, <b>contingent</b> <b>on</b> papal approval. Paschal signalled his approval, and in 1109 the monastery became a bishopric. Ely still remained a monastic house, as the abbey itself became the cathedral and the monks of the abbey became the monks of the cathedral chapter. Also in 1109, the pope approved Hervey's translation to a new see, and he was made Bishop of Ely. He was enthroned at Ely in October 1109.|$|E
50|$|Although {{both sides}} have strong <b>contingents</b> <b>on</b> the site, many members have not fully decided which side they belong to. For these members, the site {{provides}} a safe {{place in which to}} think through these issues and the resources to help people make informed decisions. Another example of the variety of opinions is that many Side A members on the site choose to remain sexually abstinent until they are in a committed relationship and/or legal marriage. These types of beliefs exemplify the conflicts that some gay Christians have encountered with the mainstream gay community.|$|R

50|$|On 5 March, Islamic State militants {{set fire}} to oil wells in the Ajil field, {{in an attempt to}} hinder airstrikes against their positions. According to {{military}} sources, the allied forces had retaken the village of al-Maibdi, on the road between Tikrit and Kirkuk, as well as the nearby Ajil and Alas oilfields.
