40|$|In bilingual processing, <b>cognates</b> <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> facilitatory processing, while {{switching}} between languages <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> a processing cost. This study investigates whether co-activation {{of cognates}} affects {{the magnitude of}} switch costs in sentence context. A shadowing task was conducted to examine whether verb cognates reduce switch costs in sentences that switched between participants' L 1 and L 2. In addition, we considered whether these effects were influenced by L 2 proficiency, switching direction and cross-linguistic overlap in syntactic structure. Bilinguals were presented with L 1 and L 2 sentences that contained a language switch preceded by a cognate. Shadowing latencies showed that switching to L 2 was more costly than switching to L 1. Switch costs in both directions were not modulated {{by the presence of}} a verb cognate, and this effect was not affected by syntactic structure or L 2 proficiency. The results are informative for the field of bilingual processing and the lexical trigger hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{describe}} a novel gene expression signature of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) activated fibroblasts, which {{is able to}} identify breast cancers with a PDGF-stimulated fibroblast stroma and displays an independent and strong prognostic significance. Global gene expression was compared between PDGF-stimulated human fibroblasts and cultured resting fibroblasts. The most differentially expressed genes were reduced to a gene expression signature of 113 genes. The biological significance and prognostic capacity of this signature were investigated using four independent clinical breast cancer data sets. Concomitant high expression of PDGF beta receptor and its <b>cognate</b> Ligands <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> a high PDGF signature score. This supports {{the notion that the}} signature detects tumors with PDGF-activated stroma. Subsequent analyses indicated significant associations between high PDGF signature score and clinical characteristics, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positivity, estrogen receptor negativity, high tumor grade, and large tumor size. A high PDGF signature score <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> shorter survival in univariate analysis. Furthermore, the high PDGF signature score acts as a significant marker of poor prognosis in multivariate survival analyses, including classic prognostic markers, Ki- 67 status, a proliferation gene signature, or other recently described stroma-derived gene expression signatures...|$|R
40|$|In Escherichia coli, {{expression}} of the RelE and HipA toxins {{in the absence of}} their <b>cognate</b> antitoxins has <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> generating multidrug-tolerant “persisters. ” Here we show that unlike persisters of E. coli, persisters of Mycobacterium tuberculosis selected with one drug do not acquire cross-resistance to other classes of drugs. M. tuberculosis has three homologs of RelE arranged in operons with their apparent antitoxins. Each toxin individually arrests growth of both M. tuberculosis and E. coli, an effect that is neutralized by co{{expression of}} the cognate antitoxin. Overexpression or deletion of each of the RelE toxins had a toxin- and drug-specific effect on the proportion of bacilli surviving antibiotic killing. All three toxins were upregulated in vivo, but none of the deletions affected survival during murine infection. RelE 2 overexpression increased bacterial survival rates in the presence of rifampin in vitro, while deletion significantly decreased survival rates. Strikingly, deletion of this toxin had no discernible effect on the level of persisters seen in rifampin-treated mice. Our results suggest that, in vivo, RelE-generated persisters are unlikely to {{play a significant role in}} the generation of bacilli that survive in the face of multidrug therapy or in the generation of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis...|$|R
40|$|HLA-A is a class I major {{histocompatibility}} complex receptor that presents peptide antigens {{on the surface of}} most cells. Vitiligo, an autoimmune disease in which skin melanocytes <b>are</b> destroyed by <b>cognate</b> T cells, <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> variation in the HLA-A gene; specifically HLA-A∗ 02 : 01, which presents multiple vitiligo melanocyte autoantigens. Refined genetic mapping localizes vitiligo risk in the HLA-A region to an SNP haplotype ∼ 20 -kb downstream, spanning an ENCODE element with many characteristics of a transcriptional enhancer. Convergent CTCF insulator sites flanking the HLA-A gene promoter and the predicted transcriptional regulator, with apparent interaction between these sites, suggests this element regulates the HLA-A promoter. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy subjects homozygous for the high-risk haplotype expressed 39 % more HLA-A RNA than cells from subjects carrying nonhigh-risk haplotypes (P = 0. 0048). Similarly, RNAseq analysis of 1, 000 Genomes Project data showed more HLA-A mRNA expressed in subjects homozygous for the high-risk allele of lead SNP rs 60131261 than subjects homozygous for the low-risk allele (P = 0. 006). Reporter plasmid transfection and genomic run-on sequence analyses confirm that the HLA-A transcriptional regulator contains multiple bidirectional promoters, with greatest activity on the high-risk haplotype, although it does not behave as a classic enhancer. Vitiligo risk <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the MHC class I region thus derives from combined quantitative and qualitative phenomena: a SNP haplotype in a transcriptional regulator that induces gainof-function, elevating expression of HLA-A RNA in vivo, in strong linkage disequilibrium with an HLA-A allele that confers ∗ 02 : 01 specificity...|$|R

40|$|Non-optimal codons {{have been}} {{reported}} to occur with higher frequency in the signal sequences of secretory proteins in Escherichia coli compared to both the 5  mature region of secretory and non-secretory genes (134). Non-optimal codons are defined by their low-usage in a genome, low concentrations of <b>cognate</b> tRNA and <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> translational pausing. This thesis presents data on two secretory proteins, maltose binding protein (MBP) and &# 946;-lactamase (Bla), which were chosen as model systems to study the role of non-optimal codons in export. For both proteins, the non-optimal codons were changed to an optimal codon within the synonymous codon family. For the optimised MBP allele (MBP-opt), there was an approximate 20 -fold reduction in protein expression compared to MBP-wt. The expression of MBP-opt was partially recovered in strains deficient in multiple cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteases. This suggests that non-optimal codons are important to allow for the correct folding of the pre-protein before secretion, in particular for the signal peptide. In the &# 946;-lactamase study, the optimised allele (bla-opt) had four-fold less expression compared to the wild-type allele (bla-wt). To investigate the effect of the distribution of non-optimal codons in the signal sequence for expression, a series of mutations in the signal sequence, in which only a subset of the non-optimal codons were changed to optimal, were made. This revealed that non-optimal codons {{at the start of the}} signal sequence (bla-F 6) were more important for maintaining expression of &# 946;-lactamase. Since bla confers resistance to ampicillin only when fully folded in the periplasm, a revertant study was carried out to select for clones that had higher resistance than those of bla-F 6. This study revealed nine such revertants, which all had optimal to non-optimal codon reversions at various positions in the front half of the &# 946;-lactamase signal sequence. The results of these studies in both MBP and &# 946;- lactamase suggest that non-optimal codons are important for a time-critical early event in the export of proteins to the periplasm. Most prokaryotic sec dependent signal peptides have a positive charge at the Nterminus. Yet studies have shown that the positive charge is not required for export (74, 137, 174). To investigate this, the charge distribution of all sec dependent signal peptides was analysed, which revealed a massive bias for lysine at the second and third amino acid positions (P 2 and P 3) and a slight bias for arginine at P 3. Whilst consistent with the requirement for a positive charge at the N-terminus, it raised the question as to why there was a massive bias for lysine and not arginine at P 2 ? Investigating the codon usage at the various positions revealed that the lysine codon AAA is overrepresented at P 2. Other studies have shown that codon and amino acid choice at P 2 can affect translation initiation (159) and removal of f-Met by methionylamino peptidase (MAP) (51). To experimentally determine the selection constraints on codon and amino acid usage at P 2 in secretory proteins, the signal sequences of MBP and alkaline phosphatase (AP) were fused to the mature region of &# 946;-lactamase. Both of these signal sequences had the lysine codon AAA at P 2, which was changed to various other codons and the effect on export measured by resistance to ampicillin. The results of these experiments demonstrate that a positive charge is not required for protein export, and suggest that the dominant selective pressure at P 2 is for codons that promote high translation initiation efficiencies...|$|R
