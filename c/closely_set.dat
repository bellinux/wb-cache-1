An intelligent breed, it was particularly adapted to the climate of the Swiss Alps.|$|E
5|$|St Peter's {{is made up}} {{of three}} parts, {{including}} a mid-19th-century west tower, which replaced the original in 1859–60 after it fell down. The perpendicular clerestory is decorated with shields in quatrefoils and is lit with <b>closely</b> <b>set</b> three-light windows. The tall decorated chancel has very large windows. The side windows have reticulated tracery. The large east window was partly rebuilt in 1875–76, and is composed of six lights with two large mouchettes nodding to each other, as well as a very large reticulation unit.|$|E
5|$|The large {{pectoral}} fins measure around one-fifth {{as long as}} the body, {{and have}} a falcate (sickle-like) shape tapering to a point. The first dorsal fin is of moderate size and somewhat falcate, with a pointed apex and a strongly concave rear margin; its origin lies over the pectoral fin free rear tips. The second dorsal fin is much smaller and is positioned about opposite the anal fin. A low dorsal ridge is present between the dorsal fins. The caudal fin is large and high, with a well-developed lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The dermal denticles are diamond-shaped and <b>closely</b> <b>set,</b> each bearing five horizontal ridges leading to teeth on the posterior margin. This species is bronzy to bluish gray above and white below, which extends onto the flanks as a faint lighter stripe. The fins, particularly the underside of the pectoral fins and the lower caudal fin lobe) darken towards the tips; this is more obvious in juveniles.|$|E

500|$|The choir stalls {{date from}} about 1380. They have high, spiky, <b>closely</b> <b>set</b> canopies, with crocketed arches and spirelets. The stall ends have poppyheads and are rich with figurative carving. The stalls include 48misericords, all but five {{of which are}} original, {{depicting}} a variety of subjects, some humorous and some grotesque. Pevsner states that they are [...] "one of the finest sets in the country", while Alec Clifton-Taylor calls them “exquisite” and says of the misericords that “for delicacy and grace they surpass even those at Lincoln and Beverley”.|$|E
500|$|The {{dining room}} {{had a high}} {{wainscot}} of mahogany, paneled in rectangles, above which is a broad tapestry frieze. The ceiling is beamed with <b>closely</b> <b>set</b> beams, and the cornice is mahogany like the other woodwork. The room is lighted by the cluster of lights applied to the wainscot. The house's pantry was [...] "as large as many New York apartments", had a counter and wash bowls and large rows of glazed closets around other walls. The kitchen and serving room had a refrigerator and were well stocked and equipped. The breakfast room was green and white, with woodwork painted white and walls covered in Nile green cloth; it had a wood mantel with facings of mottled white marble, also imported from Italy. Adjoining is the morning-room, finished in quartered oak, with walls papered in red stripes of two shades, has a quartered oak wainscot and white cornice, curtains and furniture are red and gold.|$|E
500|$|The coat is {{basically}} golden-yellow to buff, and extensively marked with black spots and stripes. The spots show great variation in size. Melanistic servals are also known. Facial features include the brownish or greenish eyes, white whiskers on the snout {{and near the}} ears, ears as large as those of a domestic cat (but large relative {{to the size of}} the head) and black on the back with a white horizontal band in the middle, whitish chin, and spots and streaks on the cheeks and the forehead. Three to four black stripes run from the back of the head onto the shoulders, and then break into rows of spots. The white underbelly has dense and fluffy basal fur, and the soft guard hairs (the layer of fur protecting the basal fur) are [...] long. Guard hairs are up to [...] long on the neck, back and the flanks, and are merely [...] long on the face. The <b>closely</b> <b>set</b> ears are black on the back with a horizontal white band; the ears can rotate up to 180 degrees independently of each other. The serval has a good sense of smell, hearing and vision.|$|E

2500|$|Kerry has a stone-built church tower with a timber capping {{characteristic}} of many Border churches. The distribution of similar bell towers and churches with timber belfries has been mapped by Hilling, {{but it should}} be noted that churches with these towers and belfries occur widely in Shropshire and Herefordshire. The Kerry tower has been strengthened with buttresses to take the weight of the bells, a feature seen on other church towers such as at Bettws Cedewain. The addition of the timber campanile to these churches is likely to have taken place in the early 16th century, and this is supported by the evidence of dendrochronology or tree-dating at Kerry which was undertaken by the RCAHMW It was established that the felling date for the timber in the bell chamber wall frame was winter 1525/26. The felling for the clock chamber ceiling beams was winter 1567/68. [...] The stone-built tower is probably 13th-century, but the bell-stage was modified twice in the 16th century. Tree-ring dating established that the two-tier timber-framed bell-stage was built in winter 1525/26. The bell-chamber floor was found to have been renewed in 1567/68 with very large and <b>closely</b> <b>set</b> beams, presumably to support the weight of a heavy bell-frame ...|$|E

60|$|From {{the fact}} that this room lay {{directly}} over the small one occupied by Inez, in which was the wall cavity they had recently explored, they conceived the idea that the wall here might also be hollow. Pounding upon it, however, had no effect in determining this, for kiln-baked adobe is not resonant and it was impossible to discover from any surface indication whether there were eight feet of <b>closely</b> <b>set</b> blocks or less. Careful search for any sign of an opening proved futile.|$|E
60|$|One {{other was}} present at that meal, of whom I shall have more to say hereafter. This {{was a young man}} of good presence, save, perhaps, a too {{obtrusive}} foppishness, whom Monsieur de Lavedan presented to me as a distant kinsman of theirs, one Chevalier de Saint-Eustache. He was very tall--of fully my own height--and of an excellent shape, although extremely young. But his head if anything was too small for his body, and his good-natured mouth was of a weakness that was confirmed by the significance of his chin, whilst his eyes were too <b>closely</b> <b>set</b> to augur frankness.|$|E
60|$|But first, the ventilator. This is a steel shaft {{that leads}} {{up from the}} coal-carrying bowels of the ship beneath the lazarette and that wins to the outside-world via the after-wall of the chart-house.

Its opening, {{at the height of}} a man's head, is screened with iron bars so <b>closely</b> <b>set</b> that no mature-bodied rat can squeeze between. Also, this opening commands the wheel, which is a scant fifteen feet away and directly across the booby-hatch. Some mutineer, crawling along the space between the coal and the deck of the lower hold, had climbed the ventilator shaft and was able to take aim through the slits between the bars.|$|E

60|$|They {{did as he}} bade them, and for {{the first}} time his face was fully {{revealed}} in the straggling twilight. A flowing grey beard, still plentifully streaked with black, rested upon his chest; and the eyes, steadily fixed upon the window pane, were dark and undimmed. A long illness had wasted his fine features, but had detracted nothing from their strength and regularity of outline. His lips were <b>closely</b> <b>set,</b> and his expression, though painfully eager, was not otherwise displeasing. There was none of the fear of death there; nor was there anything of the passionless resignation of the man who has bidden farewell to life, and made his peace with God and man; nor, in those moments of watching, had his face any of the physical signs of approaching death.|$|E
60|$|He was, as I have said, a tall, thin man; and he {{had long}} hands that were very big and bony in the knuckles. Indeed they looked like monstrous {{skeleton}} hands with a glove of skin stretched over them. He was quite bald, save for a curly grizzled fringe that surrounded {{the back of his}} head, on a level with his enormous ears, and his forehead ran up to the summit of his egg-shaped head. His nose was pendulous and his eyes were <b>closely</b> <b>set,</b> with too crafty a look for honesty. He wore no beard, and his leathery cheeks were blue from the razor. His age may have been fifty; his air was mean and sycophantic. Finally he was dressed in a black gaberdine that descended to his knees, and he ended in a pair of the leanest shanks and largest feet conceivable.|$|E
60|$|Now Sir Thomas Ryder was--or rather is, for he {{is still}} in perfect health and full vigour--a very {{different}} type of man. You have no doubt seen him about town--for he takes a constitutional in the park every day {{on his way to}} his work, and he goes to most first nights at the theatres--and if so you will have admired the keen, sharp face, the <b>closely</b> <b>set</b> eyes, the mobile mouth free from moustache or beard: the face is furrowed all over, especially round the eyes, yet he does not look old. That is because of the furrows; they form a wonderful net-work round his eyes, giving them an expression of perpetual keen amusement. The hair is pale in colour--not white but faded--and scanty. Sir Thomas wears it carefully brushed across the top of his head, with a parting on the left side.|$|E
