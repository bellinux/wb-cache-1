40|$|Which {{populations are}} {{replenished}} primarily by immigrants (open) and which by local production (closed) remains {{an important question}} for management with implications for response to exploitation, protection, and disturbance. However, we lack methods for predicting population openness. Here, we develop a model for openness and show that considering habitat isolation explains the existence of surprisingly <b>closed</b> <b>populations</b> in high-dispersal species, including many marine organisms. Relatively <b>closed</b> <b>populations</b> are expected when patch spacing {{is more than twice}} the standard deviation of a species 2 ̆ 7 dispersal kernel. In addition, natural scales of habitat patchiness on coral reefs are sufficient to create both largely open and largely <b>closed</b> <b>populations.</b> Contrary to some previous interpretations, largely <b>closed</b> marine <b>populations</b> do not require mean dispersal distances that are unusually short, even for species with relatively long pelagic larval durations. We predict that habitat patchiness has strong control over population openness for many marine and terrestrial species with a highly dispersive life stage and relatively sedentary adults. This information {{can be used to make}} initial predictions about where populations will be more or less resilient to local exploitation and disturbance...|$|R
50|$|The {{critical}} community size (CCS) is {{the minimum}} {{size of a}} <b>closed</b> <b>population</b> within which a human-to-human, non-zoonotic pathogen can persist indefinitely.|$|E
50|$|When {{the size}} of the <b>closed</b> <b>population</b> falls below the {{critical}} community size level, the low density of infected hosts causes extinction of the pathogen. This epidemiologic phenomenon was first identified during measles outbreaks in the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|Broodstocks require supplementation {{from outside}} sources {{regularly}} to prevent {{negative effects of}} closed populations. Domestication of broodstocks in hatcheries can reduce reproductive capabilities and alter other genetic characteristics. For example, a trout stock maintained as a <b>closed</b> <b>population</b> for 20 generations showed reduced number and size of egg production.|$|E
40|$|Mixture {{models have}} been widely used to model heterogeneity. In this thesis, we focus on the use of mixture models in capture [...] recapture, for both <b>closed</b> <b>populations</b> and open populations. We provide both {{practical}} and theoretical investigations. A new model is proposed for <b>closed</b> <b>populations</b> and the practical difficulties of model fitting for mixture models are demonstrated for open populations. As the number of model parameters can increase with the number of mixture components, whether we can estimate all of the parameters using the method of maximum likelihood is an important issue. We explore this using formal methods and develop general rules to ensure that all parameters are estimable...|$|R

50|$|The female {{scatters}} non-adhesive {{eggs in a}} slow low flight over grasslands. The larva is nocturnal. There {{are four}} moults. The larva hibernates while in the third instar, breaking diapause to feed on warm winter evenings. Feeding resumes in the spring. The pupa stands generally upright in a flimsy silk cocoon, {{at the base of}} a grass tussock. This stage lasts for two weeks. A. hyperantus is generally considered to have a <b>closed</b> <b>population</b> structure since it occurs in small, well-defined populations.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{alternative}} {{explanations for}} the low Autism/ASD rates in the Amish communities. Autism {{is thought to have}} many genetic or epigenetic correlations. [...] If prevalence of ASDs did vary in a relatively isolated, <b>closed</b> <b>population</b> such as Amish communities, it could be explained by gene pool variations compared the general population. Similarly to Amish having statistically higher rates of some conditions (such as dwarfism, Angelman syndrome and metabolic disorders), they could also be expected to have lower rates of some others.|$|E
50|$|Other related methods {{which are}} often used include the Jolly-Seber model (used in open populations and for {{multiple}} census estimates) and Schnabel estimators (described above as an expansion to the Lincoln-Peterson method for <b>closed</b> <b>populations).</b> These are described in detail by Sutherland.|$|R

The adult males usually have carapaces that seldom exceed 13 cm (about 4.5 in), whilst the adult females' carapaces {{are no more than}} 16.5 cm (some 6.5 in) long. The geographically <b>closest</b> <b>population</b> of the T. graeca group, from Morocco, is decidedly larger.|$|R
50|$|If a {{population}} of feral adult female farm cats is high enough, a farm cat population can be self-sustaining. The females establish permanent homes in barns or other structures and raise repeated litters. Males may stay around if food is plentiful, though they tend to roam over a wider territory. Farm cat colonies can be subject to inbreeding, as a <b>closed</b> <b>population</b> may mate with one another's siblings, parents, or offspring. Spaying and neutering prevent unwanted litters and inbreeding. In some cases, feral animals are trapped, spayed or neutered, then re-released to keep their territory claimed and to prevent new, fertile strays from taking up residence.|$|E
50|$|Homozygosity/Autozygosity mapping is a {{powerful}} technique, but is only valid when searching for a mutation segregating within a small, <b>closed</b> <b>population.</b> Such a small population, possibly created by the founder effect, will have a limited gene pool, and thus any inherited disease {{will probably be a}} result of two copies of the same mutation segregating on the same haplotype. Since affected individuals will probably be homozygous in the regions, looking at SNPs in a region is an adequate marker of regions of homozygosity and heterozygosity. Modern day SNP arrays are used to survey the genome and identify large regions of homozygosity. Homozygous blocks in the genomes of affected individuals can then be laid on top of each other, and the overlapping region should contain the disease gene.|$|E
50|$|A {{complicated}} {{debate among}} conservation biologists (also {{known as the}} SLOSS debate) focused on whether {{it is better to}} create one large or several small reserves. The species area relationship '''''' states that the number of species in a habitat is directly proportional to its size. So theoretically if several small reserves have a greater total area than a single large reserve, the small reserves will contain a greater total number of species. This, combined with assumptions of island biogeography theory, lead Jared Diamond to state that a single large reserve is the best method of conservation, and it is still commonly recommended. For example, a review by Ovaskainen determined that a single large reserve site is best at maximising long-term survival of the species and deferring extinction in a <b>closed</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{neighbourhood}} changed greatly {{after the}} highway was completed {{and the park}} <b>closed.</b> <b>Population</b> density increased with the building of numerous apartment buildings. Jameson Avenue, which became the conduit to the highway changed from single family homes to a street of apartment buildings, many cheaply built. Nearby, many of the mansions and large houses became makeshift low-rise 'bachelorette' apartment buildings and rooming houses. Several had operated as tourist hotels for visitors to Sunnyside and the CNE. Industrial activity declined along the railways. One former industrial site on West Lodge Avenue became a two-tower apartment complex that has repeatedly been cited by the City for various by-law infractions. Businesses suffered during the transition, with leisure-type businesses compatible with the Park, such as the Brighton and Odeon theatres closing. Along Queen Street, which saw traffic decline substantially, many businesses closed or changed hands.|$|E

40|$|International audienceGenotypic {{structure}} of a <b>closed</b> <b>population</b> of the clonal ericaceous shrub Rhododendron ferrugineum is examined {{in the light of}} two independent studies previously conducted on this species. In the first study, spatial distribution of genotypes in the <b>closed</b> <b>population</b> was inferred from the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) procedure. Age of clones was estimated using their spatial extent and the annual growth rate of shoots. In the second study, ramet demography was studied in the three most representative stages of shrub invasion on two different sites, including the site where the population investigated by AFLP grew. The demographic data recorded were the area occupied by ramets and ramet age, and from this information the developmental pattern of Rhododendron populations was determined. Additional data such as genet density and distance between genets were calculated. These two sources of information allow us to propose that all or most of the clones detected in the <b>closed</b> <b>population</b> established at the early successional stage, and that the present genotypic structure was established several hundred years ago, long before the population reached total closure. Hypotheses concerning the future development of this genotypic structure are discussed...|$|E
