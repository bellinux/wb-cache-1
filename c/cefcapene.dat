40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antibacterial}} activities of oral cephem antibiotics and ketolide telithromycin against major respiratory pathogens possessing β-lactam-resistant mutations (within the pbp gene) and/or macrolide-resistant genes (erm and mef) {{were examined in}} clinical isolates collected at 66 institutes in all over the Japan between 2002 and 2003. Telithromycin showed the strongest antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains with and without macrolide-resistant genes, such as ermA or ermC gene. All the cephem antibiotics showed potent antibacterial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0. 015 mg/L or lower. Cefdinir had a much higher MIC 90 against genotypic penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (gPRSP) than cefditoren and <b>cefcapene</b> (8 mg/L cefdinir vs. 1 mg/L cefditoren and <b>cefcapene).</b> The majority of gPRSP harbored either ermB or mefA, and the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against these strains was decreased however some susceptibility was still sustained. Cefditoren exerted the strongest antibacterial activity against β-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, with an MIC 90 of 0. 5 mg/L. These results underline the importance of checking the susceptibility and selecting an appropriate antibiotic against target pathogens...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{elucidate}} the absorption mechanism in Caco- 2 and rat intestine models in order to improve the accuracy of prediction of oral absorption of ester prodrugs. Pivampicillin and <b>cefcapene</b> pivoxil hydrochloride (CFPN-PI), ester-type oral antibiotics, were chosen as model ester prodrugs. The level of esterase activity in Caco- 2 cells was lower than that measured in the rat jejunum when p-nitrophenyl acetate was used as a substrate. Almost complete ester hydrolysis occurred before the ester prodrugs reached the basolateral side of the monolayer, and the disappearance of prodrugs was thought to be due to metabolism or transport after addition to the apical side of the monolayer. When pivampicillin and CFPN-PI were used, the amounts of ampicillin and <b>cefcapene</b> (CFPN) produced by hydrolysis of prodrugs were increased because intracellular degradation of prodrugs resulted in intracellular accumulation. On the other hand, when ampicillin or CFPN was used, only a small amount of the drug reached the basolateral side of the monolayers and no intracellular accumulation was observed. The permeability of CFPN-PI, the solubility of which is dependent on the acidity of gastric juice, across a Caco- 2 monolayer or rat intestine, was also investigated by using an in vitro system that mimics the physiological state of the human gastrointestinal tract. The oral absorption of CFPN-PI in humans is predicted to be good either in the Caco- 2 model or in the rat intestine model. It is concluded that our system may be a valuable tool for evaluation of oral absorption of ester prodrugs metabolized during permeation through the intestinal epithelium. Broader evaluation of such a system is warranted...|$|E
40|$|Introduction:  The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the current antimicrobial susceptibility of the principle anaerobic pathogens involved in dentoalveolar infection, to 13 oral antibiotics, and to assess the value of each antibiotic in the management of the infection. Methods:  A total of 800 isolates from patients with dentoalveolar infection (Prevotella species, Fusobacterium species, Porphyromonas species and Peptostreptococcus micros) were tested for their susceptibility to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefuroxime, <b>cefcapene,</b> cefdinir, erythromycin, azithromycin, telithromycin, minocycline, levofloxacin, clindamycin, and metronidazole using an agar dilution method. Results:  Although the majority of Fusobacterium strains were resistant to erythromycin, azithromycin, and telithromycin, the remaining antibiotics demonstrated a high level of antimicrobial activity. P. micros and Porphyromonas species exhibited high susceptibility to all antibiotics tested in this study. In the case of Prevotella species, resistance to amoxicillin occurred in 34...|$|E
40|$|Surveys of beta-lactamases in {{different}} parts of the world show an important increase in class C beta-lactamases, thus the study of these enzymes is becoming an important issue. We created an overproduction system for Mox- 1, a plasmid class C beta-lactamase, by cloning the gene encoding this enzyme, and placing it under the control of a T 7 promoter, using vector pET 28 a. The enzyme, purified by ion exchange chromatography, was used to obtain the molecular mass (38 246), the N-terminal sequence (GEASPVDPLRPVV), and p/ (8. 9), and to perform a detailed kinetic study. Cephalotin was used as reporter substrate in the case of poor substrates. The kinetic study showed that benzylpenicillin, cephalotin, <b>cefcapene</b> and moxalactam were good substrates for Mox- 1 (k(cat) /K-m values > 2. 5 x 10 (6) M- 1 s(- 1)). On the other hand, ceftazidime and cefepime were poor substrates for this enzyme (K-m values > 200 muM). Clavulanic acid had no inhibitory effect on Mox- 1 (K-m = 30. 2 mM), however aztreonam behaved as an inhibitor of Mox- 1 (K-i = 2. 85 muM). (C) 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

40|$|Intraventricular rupture of a {{brain abscess}} is still {{associated}} with a high mortality rate. Here, we report such a case in a patient with normal immunity that was treated successfully using neuroendoscopic approach. A 69 -yearold man who had presented with headache and fever developed confusion and restlessness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass with ring enhancement extending to the right ventricle. Emergency aspiration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal canal revealed severe purulent meningitis. Bacterial culture of the CSF and blood was negative. Because of prolonged consciousness disturbance, the patient underwent evacuation of the intraventrcular abscess using a neuroendoscope. The pus was centrifuged and collected for bacterial culture, and this revealed Streptococcus intermedius/milleri. After implantation of a ventricular catheter, gentamicin sulfate was administered twice a day for 9 days. Cefotaxime sodium was also administered intravenously for 14 days, followed by oral administration of <b>cefcapene</b> pivoxil hydrochloride for 10 days. The patient made a complete recovery, and was discharged 31 days after admission. After 20 months of follow-up, he is doing well and has returned to his work. In cases of intraventricular rupture {{of a brain}} abscess, a neuroendoscopic approach is useful for evacuation of intraventricular debris or septum, and identification of the causative bacterium for selection of antibiotics, possibly reducing the period of hospitalization...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. Currently {{established}} {{first line}} therapy of acute (presumed bacterial) rhinosinusitis (ARS) consists of 10 to 14 days of oral amoxicillin or cephalosporins. This study compared the clinical efficacy and tolerance of <b>cefcapene</b> pivoxil (CP) and amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC) {{in patients with}} ARS. Methods. A randomized, open labeled, double-blinded trial of ARS patients over 15 years of age was performed. Patients diagnosed with ARS received paranasal sinus X-rays and nasal endoscopies and 2 weeks of either CP (150 mg, 3 times/ day) or AMC (625 mg, amoxicillin 500 mg, 3 times/day). All patients revisited the clinic on days 7, 14, and 28 for evaluation of changes in symptoms, endoscopy, and monitoring of any adverse reactions. Demographics, clinical characteristics and drug efficacy were also compared between the two groups. Results. Among the 60 initially enrolled patients (CP 30, AMC 30), 5 patients in the CP group and 6 in the AMC group were excluded due to poor compliance. There {{were no significant differences}} in demographic data including age, sex, initial signs and symptoms, endoscopic and X-ray findings between the two groups. Rates of improvement after 2 weeks were 96 % and 95. 8 % in the CP and AMC group, respectively. Sinus symptoms were changed significantly after 2 and 4 weeks, however, there was no difference between groups (P= 0. 41). The most common adverse reaction was gastrointestinal complication, diarrhea occurred in 1 patient in the CP group and 6 in the AMC group (P= 0. 04). Conclusion. CP and AMC were both effective in treating ARS. The difference of treatment outcome was not found betwee...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Nonencapsulated and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a {{major cause}} of human {{respiratory}} tract infections. Some strains of NTHi can cause invasive diseases such as septicemia and meningitis, even if H. influenzae is not generally considered to be an intracellular pathogen. There have been very few reports about the therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics against respiratory tract infection caused by NTHi in mice because it is difficult for H. influenzae to infect mice. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of antibiotics against NTHi in both a cell culture model and a mouse model of infection. Methods We used six strains of NTHi isolated from adult patients with chronic otitis media, namely three β-lactamase-negative ampicillin (AMP) -resistant (BLNAR) strains and three β-lactamase-negative AMP-susceptible (BLNAS) strains, to evaluate the efficacy of AMP, <b>cefcapene</b> (CFPN), levofloxacin (LVX), clarithromycin (CLR), and azithromycin (AZM) in both a cell culture infection model and a mouse infection model. In the cell culture infection model, strains that invade A 549 human alveolar epithelial cells were treated with each antibiotic (1 μg/ml). In the mouse infection model, female C 57 BL/ 6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) three days before intranasal infection with 1 × 10 9 colony-forming units (CFU) of NTHi and on the day of infection. After infection, the mice were orally administered each antibiotic three times daily for three days, except for AZM, which was administered once daily for three days, at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day. Results In the cell culture infection model, it was found that two BLNAR strains were able to enter the cell monolayers by the process of macropinocytosis, and treatment with LVX yielded good bactericidal activity against both strains inside the cells. In the mouse infection model, no bacteria were detected by means of plating the lung homogenates of LVX-treated mice at day 4 after infection, while more than 10 5 CFU of bacteria per tissue sample were detected in nontreated mice. Conclusion Our findings show the outcome and rich benefits of fluoroquinolone treatment of respiratory infections caused by either invasive or noninvasive BLNAR strains of NTHi. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Pasteurella species, {{widely known}} as {{indigenous}} orgganisms {{in the oral}} and gastrointestinal floras of many wild and domestic animals, are important pathogens in both animals and humans. Human infections due to Pasteurella species are in most cases associated with infected injuries following animal bites. We encountered a rare case of dual infections caused by different two Pasteurella species occurred in a previously healthy 25 -year-old female sustaining injury by a dog-bite. Methodology Exudates from the open wound of her dog-bite site, together with the saliva of the dog were submitted for bacteriological examination. Predominantly appearing grayish-white smooth colonies with almost the same colonial properties but slightly different glistening grown on chocolate and sheep blood agar plates were characterized morphologically by Gram's stain, biochemically by automated instrument using Vitek 2 system using GN cards together with commercially available kit system, ID-Test HN- 20 rapid panels, and genetically by sequencing the 16 S rRNA genes of the organism using a Taq DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing and a model 3100 DNA sequencer instrument. Results The causative isolates from the dog-bite site were finally identified as P. canis and P. dagmatis from {{the findings of the}} morphological, cultural, and biochemical properties together with the comparative sequences of the 16 S rRNA genes. Both the isolates were highly susceptible to many antibiotics and the patient was successfully treated with the administration of so-called the first generation cephalosporin, cefazolin followed by so-called the third generation cephalosporin, <b>cefcapene</b> pivoxil. The isolate from the dog was subsequently identified as P. canis, the same species as the isolate from the patient. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this was the second report of a dual infection with Pasteurella species consisting of P. dagmatis and P. canis resulting from a dog-bite, followed by the first report of dual infections due to P. dagmatis and P. multocida in 1988. Our isolate finally identified as P. dagmatis was misidentified as P. pneumotripica by means of the Vitek 2 system. The species name " P. dagmatis" {{was not included in the}} database of the system. It is also important for routine clinical microbiology laboratories to know the limitation of the automated Vitek 2 system for the accurate identification of Pasteurella species especially P. dagmatis. It should be emphasized that there still exists much room for improvement in Vitek 2 system. Significant improvement of Vitek 2 system especially in the identification of Pasteurella species is urgently desired. </p...|$|E
