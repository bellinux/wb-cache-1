50|$|Encounter is {{the oldest}} {{scholarly}} academic journal in Nicaragua, originating in 1968. The intellectuals who created this quarterly envisaged reflections on the <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultures</b> in Nicaragua, between North and South America and also between the Mexican (Nahua and Aztec) and Andean (Inca and Chibcha) cultures. It searched for human solidarity, beginning with teachers and students. Publication was interrupted for {{a year after the}} earthquake that destroyed Managua in 1972 and from financial constraints at UCA from 1990 to 1993. After 1972 Encounter was an annual, but in 1998 it returned to being a quarterly of social research.|$|E

These historical facts are considered as a metaphor of translation in general, and letters, chronicles and histories of some Spanish authors of that period are analyzed as examples of interpretation / translation based on their eurocentric and Christian background. Finally, domestication of the New Spain culture is indicated as a main translation strategy and a <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultures</b> rather than dialogue is stressed as a general feature of the cultural contact.

The Gulf War {{showed that}} a {{powerful}} anti-American current persisted in France in the 1990 s {{in spite of the}} apparent seduction of the American model following the disappearance of De Gaulle and the Berlin wall. Latent among the French who sided the American led anti-Irakian camp, Americanophobia welded together the mixed bag of war opponents. Complaints such as the vassalization of the world, the thirst for gas, the <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultures,</b> and media misinformation also expressed a profound worry about French identity itself.

40|$|Abstract: Three {{species of}} Trichoderma (T. harzianum, T. viride and T. longibrachiatum) were {{compared}} in vitro against two isolates of Botrytis fabae and Botrytis cinerea isolated from faba bean leaves showing symptoms of chocolate spot disease grown at western Algeria. The ability of each strain of Trichoderma {{to reduce the}} growth and sporulation of B. fabae and B. cinerea was measured. Two techniques were used for this purpose: the direct <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> medium and <b>confrontation</b> remote action <b>of</b> volatile substances. Direct <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> the colonies of T. viride {{with those of the}} pathogen results in an inhibition and growth arrest at a distance of the parasite. Sporulation of Botrytis sp colonies along the zone of inhibition is greatly reduced. In the case of T. harzianum and T. longibrachiatum, no inhibition zone was observed and their mycelium quickly invade the colony of the tested pathogen.

40|$|Tumor {{invasion}} is {{a crucial}} feature of tumor growth in vivo. <b>Confrontation</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> multicellular melanoma spheroids and embryonic chick heart fragments provide a model for invasive growth in vitro. We have developed an image analysis method, which facilitates the objective measurement of tumor cell invasion in this model. Cryostat sections <b>of</b> <b>confrontation</b> <b>cultures</b> were immunohistochemically stained with an antiserum directed against the stromal component for automated recognition of the stroma tissue. The slides were automatically processed by a grey level based computerized image analysis system. On Spearman's rank correlation test, 25 out of 39 parameters correlated with the reference value of invasion, which {{was derived from the}} subjective evaluation of five independent observers. Two parameters combining the stroma margin and the total amount of stroma tissue completely reproduced the judgement of the morphologists in our test set. The quantitative evaluation of tumor invasion in vitro by automated image analysis may be helpful in pharmacologic and pathogenetic studies of tumor growth...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the current}} stage of {{globalization}} and the of the global society development, migration of population {{is an important component}} of demographic development. It has become an important phenomenon of the modern world economy. Free movement of labour force, along with the free movement of goods, capital and services, represents one of the four freedoms. The essential feature of demographic development in the states of the West, Central and Eastern Europe is decrease of the working-age population. The solution to this situation seems to be the employment of foreigners, which, however, brings about the <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultures,</b> religions, laws and standards. It is simultaneously important to recognize, accept and appreciate the differences that arose within a different cultural context, and to benefit from the managerial approaches that also arose in that environment. Diversity management can thus become an effective tool of increasing the efficiency of industrial enterprises...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} two decades of the twentieth century, a new {{movement}} began in mass media with the work of South Asian diasporic filmmakers in the West. Asian films no longer lurk outside in the periphery but have entered the mainstream, with the great success of the film by British Asian filmmaker Gurinder Chadha released in 2002, Bend It Like Beckham. Chadha is the first Asian woman to have made inroads into the mainstream public sphere of the West with her films. Her films give priority to class, race, and gender issues and focus on the position of marginalized outsiders, the working classes of the western metropolis, much of which is made up by people of color from Britain’s former colonies in Asia and Africa. This article examines the representation of female subaltern identity in Chadha’s films using the lens of cultural studies and postcolonial theory. At this dynamic moment in history, the First and Third Worlds are involved in a major <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultures,</b> while the Third World and its myriad diaspo-ras in the West are engaged in an attempt to reframe their cultural identities to stave off the threat of “cultural genocide, ” through the effects of a rampan...|$|E
40|$|From Baa to Eye: Language as Images Languages, as I understood, are {{the most}} direct <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultures</b> because of their {{inherent}} culture iconicity. My approach to employ the English language as a subject matter is to interpret the culture it represents. I use language as a metaphor to address the boundary, the inadequacy, the longing, the contradiction, the adaptation, the curiosity, and the frustration that one encounters when different cultures clash. These clashes are valuable because they help me recognize and appreciate the differences, or in other words, the otherness. Otherness is a fundamental category of human thought. It can be identified physically, psychologically, spiritually, and culturally. Through this interpretation of otherness, I am actually interrogating and reinvesting in my own culture, as well. Words {{can be the most}} direct means of sharing thoughts. Discovering the visual expressiveness of language as form has allowed me to articulate emotions and reflections that I am not vocally capable of. Utilizing a corridor-like structure in this exhibition is to provide an opportunity for viewers to be physically immersed in the installation. The incorporation of a vivid-red door and soft-white rope balls is to visually break the density of the matt-black walls. Conceptually, these objects add other aspects to the installation; they reference a goal, a destination that one hopes to reach after a long expedition. With all these elements, I intend to create a space to think, to interpret, and to observe information unfold. Walking along the walls of words is a journey to seek truth behind layers of meaning literally, visually and metaphorically. I attempt to encourage the viewer’s mental and physical willingness to navigate through an unfamiliar territory. In my mind, walking around the corridor where the ending is the beginning resonates with the deception I often face in life: I think I am at the finish, but instead I find myself back at the beginning with new findings yet to comprehend...|$|E
40|$|Multiculturalism {{and the new}} multi {{religious}} social realities {{are becoming}} dominant dimensions of today’s world. The huge changes in the social tissue of those societies, which up to now had an established dominant culture and religious affiliation, made them now face more than the effects of migrant flows, which inevitably causes <b>confrontations</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultures</b> and believes. The clash of civilizations, which have been so accurately predicted, took different forms <b>of</b> <b>confrontation</b> by giving floor to extremism into its organized form: an explosion of terrorism. By considering the strong connections between poverty and lack of education as an extremism cradle, many researchers consider {{the inclusion of the}} subjects related to the history and <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> religions as a strategy to reduce cultural and religious conflict as well as extremist behavior and the bases of terrorism, by increasing information and knowledge about religion starting from early teen years. Albania, a country known for its religious tolerance, is one of those countries which’ decision makers in education actually share this point of view and is going to start a project by including a module of limited hours of teaching in medium and high school students. The paper makes an analysis of the potential effects this might have considering its application related to the initial purposes of the project, by introducing the case of Italy and its strategy of religious education over the years as a comparative tool in order to analyze and predict the potential outcomes of this intent, by considering the national background of Albania and some specific learning traits and outcomes on such topics related to age and cultural set up...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{matter of}} the {{universal}} values that is the correlation between national, class and human, temporal and eternal, natural things and their place within the society is worth considering. So the aim under consideration is to view the system of values being spiritual ties of the civilization focusing on the English teaching process as development of the humanistic values through realization of language values by means of axiological linguistics. So the argument on the social component of English teaching process as adaptation of the individual within the society {{in the course of}} studying the foreign languages confirms the statement that axiology is closely connected, bounded up with foreign language teaching as a way of accommodating your native values with alien culture, traditions. The conclusion concerns globalisation process as <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> diverse <b>cultures</b> and their systems <b>of</b> values. The <b>culture</b> codes in this respect add up to correlation of the phraseological units (as a language unit) to values within axiological paradigm. The present review produces a complete piece of work considering the stated problem beginning with general statements on values then viewing a specific process of globalisation focusing on teaching language and special field of study – linguistic axiology through searching for axiological markers. Complex methodology is used: methods of analytical, qualitative, discourse analyses; phraseological identification and individual approach in foreign language teaching...|$|R
40|$|This study {{highlights}} {{the relationship between}} the State and Culture, as they were developed in the western culture and in the western history: The State is perceived as the Political Power, and Culture, pictured as the Spiritual Power. Both of these concepts have developed a dialectical and controversial articulation between them. Issues related to Economics and Cultural Management are also assessed in order to stress the epistemological, ethical and political limits considering the culture intervention in public policies. This paper also argues that a certain level <b>of</b> <b>confrontation</b> between <b>Culture</b> and the State is necessary and even desirable to enhance both, but above all to protect social development and democratic societies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{will explore}} the agentive roles <b>of</b> {{material}} <b>culture</b> in ancient colonial encounters. It takes {{as a case}} study the Roman colonization of southern Britain, from the first century BC onwards. Using ethnographic and theoretical perspectives largely drawn from social anthropology, it seeks to demonstrate that the consumption of certain types <b>of</b> continental material <b>culture</b> by some members of communities in southern Britain, pre-disposed the local population to Roman political annexation in the later part of the first century AD. Once the Roman colonial project proper commenced, different material cultures were introduced by colonial agents to maintain domination over a subaltern population. Throughout, the entanglement of people and things represented a reciprocal continuum, in which things moved people's minds, as much as people got to grips with particular things. In addition it will be suggested that the <b>confrontations</b> <b>of</b> material <b>culture</b> brought about by the colonial encounters affected the colonizer as much as the colonized. The thesis will demonstrate the impact of a variety <b>of</b> novel material <b>cultures</b> by focusing in detail on a key area of southern Britain – Chichester and its immediate environs. Material culture will be examined in four major categories: Landscapes and Buildings; Exchange, Food and Drink; Coinages; Death and Burial. Chapters dealing with these categories will be preceded by an opening chapter on the nature of Roman colonialism, followed by an introductory one on the history and archaeology of southern Britain and the study area. The Conclusion will include some thoughts on the integration of anthropological approaches to archaeological interpretation. I intend that the thesis provides a contribution to the wider debate on the role <b>of</b> material <b>culture</b> in ancient colonial projects, and an example of the increasingly productive bidirectional entanglement of archaeology and anthropology.

40|$|More and more, various {{disciplines}} {{within the}} Humanities are showing interest in mobility, migration and uprooting. The history of travel literature {{has been widely}} investigated; post-colonial {{studies have examined the}} political and philosophical implications of colonialism and its consequences on human displacement, on the <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> different <b>cultures,</b> on the vision of the other, on hybridity and on the power struggle involved in these complex relationships. However, in most cases, these analyses are androcentric. This dissertation focuses on the different perspectives brought up by feminine writing in regards to modern stories of geographical and social uprooting, to narratives of exclusion and discrimination in general. I devote one chapter each to three writers: Marguerite Duras, Annie Ernaux and Marie NDiaye, who all question the connection to origins and the loss of one’s roots, allowing us to understand how the concept of uprooting always turns into a question of deep bereavement. Strangely compelled to become what they already are (French, part of a certain social class, part of a given family or community [...] .), the authors and characters I study discuss the meaning of femininity and uprooting while struggling with the double difficulty that it represents. In addition, a parallel can be drawn between the complex journey of uprooting, centered around the desire to belong, and the outcome of total literary independence achieved by Duras, Ernaux and NDiaye...|$|R

40|$|The “Global society, cosmopolitanism {{and human}} rights” {{research}} team (GSCHR), composed by some dozen of European and extra-European scholars, has accepted {{the invitation of}} the Italian sociological Association – Sociological Theories Section and of the International Association of the French Language Sociologists for systematizing and focuses the researches on this issues. In the recent years the state-nation paradigm {{has changed in the}} global society one as the Western cultural model has given the priority to the multiple experiences in the different world contexts. Today the multiplicity is a suggestive testing ground for those sociologists that want to deepen the Eisenstadt theories. The contributions of some GSCHR scholars, collected in this book, intend to explore these theories and similar by interdisciplinary tools – e. g. the comparison with Kant (Telegdi-Csetri) – and in different social and geographical contexts (Cordeiro through work-life balance and Sorana with Latin-American arms exportations). One of the main hypothesis is the European cultural challenge in the global society: the integration of the European democratic values and human rights in the “cosmopolitanism model”. There are some hurdles that make it difficult: the uncertainty of the law and the global communication of the human rights, the assessment of the risk scenarios and the <b>confrontation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cultures.</b> The contributions <b>of</b> this book open only some of the views on this issue, starting from the essential notions of a new sociological branch of research.
