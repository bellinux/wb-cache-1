5|$|The {{incident}} {{has also}} {{become something of a}} cultural symbol representative of the North American video game crash of 1983, often cited as a <b>cautionary</b> <b>tale</b> about the hubris of poor business practices, despite suggestions that the burial allowed the company to write off the disposed-of material for tax relief purposes.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, some Roman writers, {{particularly}} Republican figures, used Alexander as a <b>cautionary</b> <b>tale</b> of how autocratic tendencies {{can be kept}} in check by republican values. Alexander was used by these writers {{as an example of}} ruler values such as amicita (friendship) and clementia (clemency), but also iracundia (anger) and cupiditas gloriae (over-desire for glory).|$|E

5|$|Throughout the Brezhnev {{years and}} the lengthy interregnum that followed, the {{generation}} which had come of age during the 'first Russian spring' of the 1950s awaited its turn in power. As Brezhnev and his colleagues died or were pensioned off, they were replaced {{by men and women}} for whom the Secret Speech and the first wave of de-Stalinization had been a formative experience, and these 'Children of Twentieth Congress' took up the reins of power under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev and his colleagues. The Khrushchev era provided this second generation of reformers with both an inspiration and a <b>cautionary</b> <b>tale.</b>|$|E
5|$|Emigration to {{the west}} {{decreased}} over the following years, but {{it is likely that}} the drop in numbers was caused more by fears over the outcome of the ongoing Mexican-American War than by the <b>cautionary</b> <b>tale</b> of the Donner Party. In 1846, an estimated 1,500 people migrated to California. In 1847, the number dropped to 450 and to 400 in 1848. The California Gold Rush spurred a sharp increase, however, and 25,000 people went west in 1849. Most of the overland migration followed the Carson River, but a few forty-niners used the same route as the Donner Party and recorded descriptions about the site.|$|E
5|$|The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel {{written by}} American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows {{a cast of}} {{characters}} living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island {{in the summer of}} 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that {{has been described as a}} <b>cautionary</b> <b>tale</b> regarding the American Dream.|$|E

5|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark {{retreated from}} Wollstonecraft's earlier focus on God as judge to God as mere creator, {{shocking}} some conservative readers {{who were not}} prepared to accept anything akin to deism. Worried more about Wollstonecraft's promotion of sensibility, fellow feminist and author Mary Hays criticized the book's mawkishness. A professor of moral philosophy, Thomas Brown, published a poetic response to the book, The Wanderer in Norway (1816). Rather than rejoicing in the freedom that Wollstonecraft argued the connection between nature and emotion offered, however, Brown represented {{her work as a}} failure and Wollstonecraft as a tragic victim. He read the book as a <b>cautionary</b> <b>tale,</b> whereas Wollstonecraft had intended it as a description of the possibilities of social and personal reform. As Favret argues, almost all of the responses to Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark placed the narrator/Mary in the position of a sentimental heroine, while the text itself, with its fusion of sensibility and politics, actually does much to challenge that image.|$|E

25|$|About 1663 Charnock took a Hindu widow as his common-law wife. A Company servant, Alexander Hamilton, {{later wrote}} {{that she had}} been a sati and that Charnock, smitten by her beauty, had rescued her from her husband's funeral pyre by the Ganges in Bihar. She was said to be a fifteen-year-old Rajput princess. Charnock renamed her Maria, and soon after he was accused of {{converting}} to Hinduism. Though he remained a devout Christian, the story of his conversion and moral laxity was so widely believed that it became a <b>cautionary</b> <b>tale</b> in a more puritanical age.|$|E
25|$|The {{embryonic}} {{techniques of}} somatic cell nuclear transfer from a specific genotype via cloning, {{as well as}} some of the problems pre-figured in Blade Runner, were demonstrated by the cloning of Dolly the sheep in 1996. Since 2001, political efforts have been mounting in many countries to ban human cloning, impelled by a sense of its abhorrence and imminence, while rumors abound that the first human clones may already have been produced, the most famous example being a claim by the extraterrestrial worshiping Raelians, a religious group who have offered no proof to support their extraordinary claims. In all of these developments, a clear tension between commercial and non-commercial interests is apparent, as scientific and business motivations conflict with ethical and religious concerns about the appropriateness of human intervention in the deepest fabric of nature. In many ways Blade Runner serves as a <b>cautionary</b> <b>tale</b> in the tradition of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein.|$|E
25|$|In February 1990, Allegra left Johnson and {{returned}} to London. After several attempts to reconcile, they divorced in April 1993. He had entered {{a relationship with a}} childhood friend, Marina Wheeler, who had moved to Brussels in 1990. In May 1993, they married at Horsham, Sussex, and Wheeler gave birth to a daughter soon after. Johnson and his new wife settled in Islington, North London, an area known for its left-liberal intelligentsia. Under the influence of this milieu and his wife, Johnson moved in a more liberal direction on issues like climate change, LGBT rights, and race relations. There, the couple had three further children, each given the joint surname of Johnson-Wheeler, who were sent to the local Canonbury Primary School and then private secondary schools. Devoting much time to his children, Johnson authored a book of verse, Perils of the Pushy Parents– A <b>Cautionary</b> <b>Tale,</b> which was published to largely poor reviews.|$|E
