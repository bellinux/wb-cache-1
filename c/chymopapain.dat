40|$|A {{method of}} {{preparation}} of papain (EC 3. 4. 22. 2) from relatively soluble types of latex of Carica papaya, including spray-dried latex produced by a controlled and relatively mild process, was devised. Spray-dried latex dissolves easily in water up to 350 mg/ml at 22 °C, which corresponds to approx. 230 mg of protein/ml. When the usual {{method of preparation}} of crystalline papain contaminated only by its oxidation products, developed by Kimmel & Smith [J. Biol. Chem. (1954) 207, 515 – 531], is applied to spray-dried latex, {{the result is a}} preparation of papain heavily contaminated by <b>chymopapains</b> A and B (EC 3. 4. 22. 6), {{and to a lesser extent}} by papaya peptidase A. This applies also to other types of papaya-latex currently commercially available, which, though less soluble than spray-dried latex, are more soluble than the types of latex available when the method of Kimmel & Smith (1954) was developed. This contamination is avoided by adjusting the concentration of the initial latex extract to 65 mg of protein/ml (or less) before salt fractionation. For spray-dried latex this corresponds to 100 mg of latex/ml. Papain isolated from spray-dried latex was characterized by using 2, 2 ′-dipyridyl disulphide and 4 -chloro- 7 -nitrobenzofurazan as thiol-specific reactivity probes and α-N-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester as substrate. Papain isolated from this source appears to have the same catalytic-centre characteristics as papain isolated previously from latex produced by harsher methods. The catalysis of the hydrolysis of α-N-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester by the mixture of thiol proteinases extracted from spray-dried latex by application of the method of Kimmel & Smith (1954) appears to obey Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The presence of the other enzymes results in an increase in the value of Km and a decrease in the catalytic-centre activity (kcat.) relative to the values for the catalysis by papain...|$|R

During the course of the purification of <b>chymopapain</b> from dried papaya latex, the appearance of several proteolytically-active components was consistently observed during chromatography on Amberlite IRC- 50 (XE- 64). We have been able to crystallize the protease present in one particular fraction which evidently differs from the <b>chymopapain</b> isolated by Ebata. This crystalline component (designated <b>chymopapain</b> B) is shown to be homogeneous by the criteria of ultra-centrifugation, electrophoresis, amino-terminal analysis and re-chromatography. Physical studies on <b>chymopapain</b> B indicate that it differs from the <b>chymopapain</b> described by Ebata (designated <b>chymopapain</b> A). Molecular weight determinations by the Archibald procedure yield a molecular weight of 35, 000 for component A and 30, 000 for component B. Electrophoretic studies indicate that both components are very basic, with their isoelectric points in the neighborhood of pH 10. Furthermore, both show relative stability to heat and acidic pH's. Like papain and <b>chymopapain</b> A, <b>chymopapain</b> B is also activated by thiol compounds, indicating that it is a sulfhydryl enzyme. Titration of the active enzyme with p-chloro-mercuribenzoate, mercuric chloride and N-ethylmaleimide reveals the presence of two free -SH groups but extended studies indicate that only one -SH is essential for activity. Preliminary investigations into the substrate specificity of this enzyme show that it resembles papain in its ability to hydrolyze a large variety of peptide and amide linkages. Thus far, N-benzoyl-L-arginine amide is found to be the most sensitive substrate for <b>chymopapain</b> B. Moreover, the ability of the <b>chymopapain</b> B to carry out anilide synthesis has been demonstrated, suggesting that this enzyme, like papain, can function as a transferase.

Summary of Background Data. Spinal instability after <b>chymopapain</b> injection may result in severe back pain. However, this undesired mechanical effect in treating disc herniation may provide a safe minimally invasive approach for anterior spinal release in scoliosis correction. Methods. A total of 138 lumbar intervertebral discs from 46 New Zealand white rabbits were randomly injected with <b>chymopapain</b> at 6. 25, 12. 5, 25, 50, 75, and 100 picokatals (pKats) / 0. 05 mL/disc. The rabbits were killed 1 week after the injection, and the lateral bending stiffness of the spinal segments without posterior elements was determined. Results. The lateral bending spinal stiffness showed no significant change after injection of 6. 25 and 12. 5 pKats/ 0. 05 mL/disc but reduced significantly following <b>chymopapain</b> injection of 25, 50, 75, and 100 pKats (all P < 0. 05 by post hoc least significant difference tests). While the lateral bending stiffness was lowest at the 100 -pKats dose, {{there were no significant}} differences between the four higher dosages. Conclusion.

Subsequently, a modified procedure for purification of <b>chymopapain</b> from dried papaya latex {{was developed by}} Ebata (J. Biol.

Titration of cyanide activated <b>chymopapain</b> with p-chloro mercuribenzoate (CMS) revealed the presence of 1. 4 - 1. 6 moles of SH per mole of enzyme (m. w., 30, 000). The controlled addition of the colored sulfhydryl reagent, N- 4 -dimethylamino- 3, 5 -dinitropheriyl) -maleimide (Witter and Tuppy, Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 45, 429, 1960), and enzymic hydrolysis of the S-DDPS-chymopapain thus formed led to the isolation of a deca-peptide containing the labeled half cysteine residue. The amino acid sequence of this peptide was found to be: Lys-Arg-Val-Pro-Asp-Ser-Gly-Glu-Cys-Tyr (Cys = the labeled half of cysteine residue). This sequence differed from those of the peptides containing the reactive SH groups of papain (Light et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci, U. S. A., 52, 1276, 1964) and ficin (Wong and Liener, Biochem. Res. Comm., 11, 470, 1964). v Possible reasons for this difference in the sulfhydryl peptides from papain and ficin and that from <b>chymopapain</b> are discussed. Preliminary studies (Ebata et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 9, 173, 1962) indicated that <b>chymopapain</b> was inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) under certain conditions. The present investigation showed that there was a corresponding loss of the CMB-titratable SH group and enzymic activity with increasing concentration of DFP added. This corroborated the work of Gould and Liener (Biochemistry, 1, 349, 1965) who reported that an impurity in the DFP preparation reacted with the essential SH group of ficin thus inactivating the enzyme. However, cyanide-activated <b>chymopapain</b> was phosphorylated by DFP (organic phosphorus/protein, 0, 89, mole/mole). Unactivated <b>chymopapain</b> was not phosphorylated under the same conditions. The site of phosphorylation was the hydroxyl group of a serine residue.

40|$|SummaryThe {{injection}} of 2. 0 mg <b>chymopapain</b> into the adolescent rabbit knee causes loss of articular cartilage proteoglycans (PG).

Pure chondroitin 4, 6 -sulfate (Condrosulf®, IBSA Lugano, Switzerland) {{has been used}} in clinical studies of human osteoarthritis (OA) as a slow-acting drug for OA (SYSADOA). Using our model of articular cartilage injury, we examined the effects of oral and intramuscular administration of Condrosulf® after chymopapain-induced cartilage injury. In this study, animals received an {{injection of}} 2. 0 mg <b>chymopapain</b> (Chymodiactin®, Boots Pharmaceuticals) into the left knee and were sacrificed after 84 days. The contralateral right knee served as a noninjected control. Some animals received oral Condrosulf® while others received intramuscular injections of Condrosulf®. Serum keratan sulfate (KS) levels were monitored to ensure degradation of the cartilage PG. Those animals not exhibiting at least a 100 % increase of serum KS following <b>chymopapain</b> injection were excluded from the study. At sacrifice, cartilage PG contents were markedly reduced in animals receiving an injection of 2. 0 mg <b>chymopapain</b> with no further treatment.

The Michaelis parameters for the hydrolysis of L-benzoylarginine p-nitroanilide and of benzyloxy-carbonyl-lysine nitrophenyl ester at 25 degrees C, and I 0. 1 at several pH values catalysed by <b>chymopapain</b> A, papaya proteinase omega, papain (EC 3. 4. 22. 2) and actinidin (EC 3. 4. 22. 14) were determined. Towards these substrates <b>chymopapain</b> A has kcat. /km values {{similar to those of}} actinidin and of papaya proteinase omega and significantly lower than those of papain or ficin. The environment of the catalytic site of <b>chymopapain</b> A is markedly different from those of other cysteine proteinases studied to date, as evidenced by the pH-dependence of the second-order rate constant (k) for the reaction of the catalytic-site thiol group with 2, 2 '-dipyridyl disulphide. The striking bell-shaped component that is a characteristic feature of the reactions of S-/ImH+ (thiolate/imidazolium) ion-pair components of many cysteine-proteinase catalytic sites with the 2, 2 '-dipyridyl disulphide univalent cation is not present in the pH-k profile for the <b>chymopapain</b> A reaction. The result is consistent with the presence of an additional positive charge in, or near, the catalytic site that repels the cationic form of the probe reagent. Resonance Raman spectra were collected at pH values 2. 5, 6. 0 and 8. 0 for each of the following dithioacyl derivatives of <b>chymopapain</b> A: N-benzoylglycine-, N-(Beta-phenylpropionl) glycine- and N-methoxycarbonylphenylalanylglycine-.

The existence in <b>chymopapain</b> M of a nucleophilic interactive Cys/His catalytic-site system analogous to those in papain (EC 3. 4. 22. 2) and other cysteine proteinases was deduced from the characteristics shape of the pH-second-order rate constant (k) profiles for its reactions with 2, 2 '-dipyridyl disulphide and ethyl 2 -pyridyl disulphide. Analysis of the pH-k data for the reactions of <b>chymopapain</b> M with the 2 -pyridyl disulphides and with 4, 4 '-dipyridyl disulphide permits the assignment of molecular pKa values of 3. 4 and 8. 7 to the formation and subsequent dehydronation of the Cys-S-/His-Im+H state of the catalytic site and reveals three other kinetically influential ionizations with pKa values 3. 4, 4. 3 and 5. 6.

Design New Zealand white rabbits were divided into four groups for treatment purposes: (1) untreated controls; (2) injected into one knee joint with the cartilage matrix degradation enzyme, chymopapain; (3) injected into one knee joint with <b>chymopapain</b> and also given subcutaneous injections of the bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid, three times per week until sacrifice at either day 28 or 56 post-chymopapain-injection; (4) received only the zoledronic acid injections. At sacrifice, the knee joints were examined grossly and histologically, and biochemically for proteoglycan content. Urine samples were analysed, at intervals, for levels of collagen cross-links which are biochemical markers of cartilage and bone. Results Animals receiving both intraarticular <b>chymopapain</b> injections and subcutaneous zoledronic acid injections displayed a significantly lower degree of grossly and histologically detectable cartilage degeneration on the tibial articular surfaces (the articular surface displaying the greatest degree of degeneration) than did animals only receiving the <b>chymopapain</b> injections.

We have conducted a prospective study of the serial changes in the MRI appearance of the intervertebral disc after chemonucleolysis with the enzyme <b>chymopapain.</b> Fourteen patients were studied after single-level chemonucleolysis and the results compared with a control group of 17 discs in six patients who had diagnostic discography without enzyme insertion. A consistent pattern of gradual loss of signal from the nucleus pulposus culminating in complete loss of nuclear signal was seen in all cases after chemonucleolysis. <b>Chymopapain</b> therefore produced MRI changes analogous with premature gniss disc degeneration. The rate at which this occurred varied; complete loss of signal took at least six weeks. Transitory minor end-plate changes were present in five patients, probably representing a mild chemical discitis. No similar changes were seen in the discography group. Chemical dissolution of the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc by the enzyme <b>chymopapain</b> was first described 22 years ago (Smith 1964). The efficacy of <b>chymopapain</b> over placebo has been proved in double-blind randomised studies (Javid et al. 1983; Fraser 1984) and the technique is now an established treatment for sciatica due to intervertebral disc protrusion (McCulloch and Macnab 1983; Wiltse 1983). However, the exact mechanism of action of this proteolytic enzyme in vivo is still not known. In Vitro {{it has been shown}} to act by hydrolysis of the non-collagen ground substance of the nucleus pulposus (Stern 1969; Garvin, Jennings and Stern 1977). The <b>chymopapain</b> binds to the acid muco-polysaccharides (Stern and Smith 1967) and splits the proteoglycans which are normally responsible for main-taming the high water content of the nucleus pulposu...|$|E
40|$|The {{amino acid}} {{sequence}} of the cysteine proteinase CC-III from the latex of the subtropical species Carica candamarcensis Hook has been determined {{with the exception of}} seven residues (pos. 180 – 186). It was deduced from the sequence analysis of the whole chain and peptides obtained by tryptic, chymotryptic, peptic and thermolysinolytic hydrolysis. CC-III consists of 214 amino acid residues. Out of a total of eight cysteine residues, six are located at positions involved {{in the formation of the}} three disulfide bridges stabilizing the structure of papain related enzymes. CC-III from Carica candamarcensis is a glycoprotein with the carbohydrate moiety bound to asparagine at position 44. Out of 210 residues compared with the sequences of the four cysteine proteinases of Carica papaya L. CC-III shares 125 identical ones (59. 5 %) with papain, 142 (67. 6 %) with papaya proteinase IV, 146 (69. 5 %) with papaya proteinase III and 156 (74. 3 %) with <b>chymopapain.</b> All amino acid residues constituting the active site and subsite S 2 in <b>chymopapain</b> are conserved in CC-III with the exception of the substitution Leu 157 → Val in the latter. This fact as well as the highest degree of identity between CC-III and <b>chymopapain</b> point to a similar specificity of both enzymes and thus CC-III might be a suitable substitute for <b>chymopapain</b> as a chemonucleolytic agent. © 1994 Walter de Gruyter & Co.

40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for the purification of a previously undetected cysteine proteinase, {{which we have}} called papaya proteinase IV, from spray-dried latex of the papaya (Carica papaya) plant. The purification involves affinity chromatography on Gly-Phe-aminoacetonitrile linked to CH-Sepharose 4 B, with elution by 2 -hydroxyethyl disulphide at pH 4. 5. The product thus obtained {{is a mixture of}} almost fully active papain and papay proteinase IV, which are then separated by cation-exchange chromatography. A preliminary characterization of papaya proteinase IV showed it to be very similar to <b>chymopapain</b> in both molecular size and charge. However, the new enzyme is immunologically distinct from the previously characterized cysteine proteinases of papaya latex. It also differs in its lack of activity against the synthetic substrates of the other papaya proteinases, in its narrow specificity against protein substrates and its lack of inhibition by chicken cystatin. Papaya proteinase IV is abundant, contributing almost 30 % of the protein in spray-dried papaya latex, and contamination of <b>chymopapain</b> preparations with this enzyme may account for some of the previously reported heterogeneity of <b>chymopapain...</b>|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{carry out}} a {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of chemonucleolysis {{in the treatment of}} lumbar disc herniation. METHODS: Clinical trials were selected from 3 electronic databases (The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, and EMBASE). Data were analyzed with the software STATA, using the meta command. RESULTS: Twenty-two clinical trials were eligible. For chemonucleolysis versus placebo, the summary risk ratio estimate for pain relief as outcome was 1. 51 (95 % CI: 1. 27 - 1. 80). The summary estimate was 1. 07 (95 % CI: 0. 95 - 1. 20) for the comparison between <b>chymopapain</b> and collagenase. Regarding chemonucleolysis with <b>chymopapain</b> versus surgery, the fixed-effect summary estimate of effect for pain relief was 0. 93 (95 % CI: 0. 88 - 0. 98) with surgery as the reference group. In this case, heterogeneity was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Chemonucleolysis with <b>chymopapain</b> was superior to placebo and was as effective as collagenase in the treatment of lumbar disc prolapse. Results for studies comparing chemonucleolysis with surgery were heterogeneous, making it difficult to interpret the summary measure of effect...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the early results of the use of intradiscal {{injection}} of <b>chymopapain</b> in 15 patients with degenerative lumbar disc disease, the following statements are warranted: The injection can be beneficial in selected patients with lumbar disc disease. The relief of leg symptoms seems to be more striking than that of the accompanying low back symptoms although both are apparent. The exact mechanism by which pain is relieved is still obscure, but helpful information has been obtained from the early results of this investigation. The failure of <b>chymopapain</b> in carefully selected patients has resulted in only a brief time delay in operative intervention...|$|E
40|$|The {{present data}} {{indicate}} that the fragmental diphtherial antitoxins produced with trypsin digestion from the large incomplete antitoxic molecules, those produced in horses at {{the initial stages of}} the diphtherial immunization, are not converted newly into small and complete antitoxic molecules in the incubation with oxidized <b>chymopapain</b> and toxin, by which those produced with pepsin digestion were converted into. It is considered that the fragments, produced with trypsin digestion, are not convenient to be converted into complete antitoxins by the incubating procedures with oxidized <b>chymopapain</b> and toxin. The fact suggests that the characteristic differentiation of the pepsin-digested globulins and trypsin-digested ones is due to the difference of the molecular fine structure of the two...|$|E
40|$|The {{molten globule}} (MG) state of {{proteins}} is widely detected through binding with 1 -anilino- 8 -naphthalene sulphonate (ANS), a fluorescent dye. This strategy {{is based upon}} the assumption that when in molten globule state, the exposed hydrophobic clusters of protein are readily bound by the nonpolar anilino-naphthalene moiety of ANS molecules which then produce brilliant fluorescence. In this work, we explored the acid-induced unfolding pathway of <b>chymopapain,</b> a cysteine proteases from Carica papaya, by monitoring the conformational changes over a pH range 1. 0 - 7. 4 by circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence, ANS binding, acrylamide quenching, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The spectroscopic measurements showed that although maximum ANS fluorescence intensity was observed at pH 1. 0, however protein exhibited ∼ 80 % loss of secondary structure which does not comply with the characteristics of a typical MG-state. In contrast at pH 1. 5, <b>chymopapain</b> retains substantial amount of secondary structure, disrupted side chain interactions, increased hydrodynamic radii and nearly 30 -fold increase in ANS fluorescence with respect to the native state, indicating that MG-state exists at pH 1. 5 and not at pH 1. 0. ITC measurements revealed that ANS molecules bound to <b>chymopapain</b> via hydrophobic interaction were more at pH 1. 5 than at pH 1. 0. However, a large number of ANS molecules were also involved in electrostatic interaction with protein at pH 1. 0 which, together with hydrophobically interacted molecules, may be responsible for maximum ANS fluorescence. We conclude that maximum ANS-fluorescence alone may not be the criteria for determining the MG of <b>chymopapain.</b> Hence a comprehensive structural analysis of the intermediate is essentially required...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the mechanism of}} nucleus pulposus regeneration after chemonucleolysis with <b>chymopapain,</b> cultured annulus fibrosus (AF) cells and nucleus pulposus (NP) cells derived from the rabbit intervertebral disc were compared morphologically and biochemically. There was {{a difference in the}} characteristics of the two cells. The AF cells consisted chiefly of chondrocyte with high cell growth and matrix production activity, while most of the NP cells were notochordal cells. <b>Chymopapain</b> had cell toxity for AF and NP cells which inhibited sulfated glycosaminoglycans synthesis. But this inhibition was reversible and cell function recovered {{with the passage of time}} in AF cells. It may be concluded from this study that AF cells play a main role in nucleus pulposus regeneration after chemonucleolysis. キモパパイン椎間板内注入後の髄核再構築現象において椎間板細胞の果たす役割を検討するため,幼若家兎椎間板細胞の培養を行い形態的観察を行なうと同時にキモパパインの培養椎間板細胞に及ぼす影響を生化学的に分析した。線維輪由来細胞は軟骨細胞としての機能を維持し旺盛な基質合性能および増殖能を示したのに対し,髄核細胞は分裂能を有しない脊索細胞が中心であった。キモパパインを種々の濃度で培養椎間板細胞に作用させ^ Sの硫酸化ムコ多糖への取り込みを指標に細胞障害性を検討したところ,濃度依存的にムコ多糖合成を抑制した。又,キキモパパインの培養線維輪細胞に対する障害性は一定濃度以下では可逆的であり,ムコ多糖合合成能は経時的に回復傾向を示した。以上のことよりキモパパイン椎間板内注入後の髄核再構築過程においては,線椎輪由来の軟骨細胞がその中心的役割を果たすと推察された...|$|E

In these studies, the fact was found that to increase the diphtherial antitoxic titers of immune equine serum globulins, which obtained from horse at the initial stages of immunization, with oxidized <b>chymopapain</b> and diphtherial toxin under suitable definite conditions of the incubation in vitro, the pre-digestion of large incomplete antitoxic globulins with pepsin is particularily necessary...|$|E
40|$|Herniated disc, {{while not}} {{the most common cause}} of low back pain, is the most common reason for surgery to relieve back pain. An {{alternative}} to surgery when sciatic pain is the result of disc herniation is chemonucleolysis with <b>chymopapain.</b> Since this enzyme is effective only in very specific circumstances, proper patient selection is crucial. Five criteria for selection are presented, emphasizing that since chemonucleolysis is not conservative treatment, it should be reserved for patients whose pain is unrelieved by conservative methods. There are several important contraindications to chemonucleolysis: allergy to <b>chymopapain,</b> risk of injury to the cauda equina, disc lesions at cord levels, pregnancy, patient's age (not recommended for adolescents) and sequestrated disc. Technique is exacting and should be limited to surgeons with the opportunity for concentrated experience...|$|E
