5|$|Natural {{materials}} {{found in}} the environment also induce plant resistance as well. <b>Chitosan</b> derived from chitin induce a plant's natural defense response against pathogens, diseases and insects including cyst nematodes, both are approved as biopesticides by the EPA to reduce the dependence on toxic pesticides.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chitosan</b> and chitin {{belong to}} a family of biopolymers {{composed}} of β(1–4)-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-glucosamine subunits. <b>Chitosan</b> is formed by alkaline N-deacetylation of chitin, which {{is the second most}} abundant natural polymer after cellulose. <b>Chitosan</b> is a biodegradable polysaccharide that has been useful in many biomedical applications such as a chelating agent, drug carrier, membrane, and water treatment additive. <b>Chitosan</b> is soluble in dilute aqueous solutions, but precipitates into a gel at a neutral pH. It does not support neural cell attachment and proliferation well, but can be enhanced by ECM-derived peptide attachment. <b>Chitosan</b> also contains weak mechanical properties, which are more challenging to overcome.|$|E
25|$|Degree of {{acetylation}} (DA) for soluble <b>chitosan</b> {{ranges from}} 0% to 60%, depending on processing conditions. A {{study was conducted}} to characterize how varying DA affects the properties of <b>chitosan.</b> Varying DA was obtained using acetic anhydride or alkaline hydrolysis. It was found that decreasing acetylation created an increase in compressive strength. Biodegradation was examined by use of lysozyme, which is known to be mainly responsible for degrading <b>chitosan</b> in vivo by hydrolyzing its glycosidic bonds and is released by phagocytic cells after nerve injury. The results reveal that there was an accelerated mass loss with intermediate DAs, compared with high and low DAs over the time period studied. When DRG cells were grown on the N-acetylated <b>chitosan,</b> cell viability decreased with increasing DA. Also, <b>chitosan</b> has an increasing charge density with decreasing DA, which is responsible for greater cell adhesion. Thus, controlling the DA of <b>chitosan</b> is important for regulating the degradation time. This knowledge could help {{in the development of a}} nerve guidance conduit from <b>chitosan.</b>|$|E
25|$|The US Forest Service tested <b>chitosan,</b> a biopesticide, to pre-arm {{pine trees}} to defend {{themselves}} against MPB. The US Forest Service results show collodial <b>chitosan</b> elicited a 40% increase in pine resin (P<0.05) in southern pine trees. One milliliter <b>chitosan</b> per 10 gallons water {{was applied to the}} ground area within the drip ring of loblolly pine trees. The application was repeated three times from May through September in 2008. The <b>chitosan</b> was responsible for eliciting natural defense responses of increased resin pitch-outs, with the ability to destroy 37% of the pine beetle eggs.|$|E
25|$|Itoh et al. (2003) {{developed}} a scaffold {{consisting of a}} single large longitudinally oriented channel was created using <b>chitosan</b> tendons from crabs. Tendons were harvested from crabs (Macrocheira kaempferi) and repeatedly washed with sodium hydroxide solution to remove proteins and to deacetylate the tendon chitin, which subsequently became known as tendon <b>chitosan.</b> A stainless steel bar with triangular-shaped cross-section (each side 2.1mm long) was inserted into a hollow tendon <b>chitosan</b> tube of circular-shaped cross-section (diameter: 2mm; length: 15mm). When comparing the circular-shaped and triangular-shaped tubes, {{it was found that}} the triangular tubes had improved mechanical strength, held their shape better, and increased the surface area available. While this is an effective method for creating a single channel, it does not provide as much surface area for cellular growth as the multi-channel scaffolds.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, four DeBakey juniors {{qualified}} for the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, two of them placed second in their respective categories detailing <b>chitosan</b> nanoparticles.|$|E
25|$|Naturally {{occurring}} chitin {{and certain}} peptides {{have been recognized}} for their antimicrobial properties in the past. Today, these materials are engineered into nanoparticles {{in order to produce}} low-cost disinfection applications. Natural peptides form nano-scale channels in the bacterial cell membranes, which causes osmotic collapse. These peptides are now synthesized in order to tailor the antimicrobial nanostructures with respect to size, morphology, coatings, derivatization, and other properties allowing them to be used for specific antimicrobial properties as desired. <b>Chitosan</b> is a polymer obtained from chitin in arthropod shells, and has been used for its antibacterial properties for a while, but even more so since the polymer has been made into nanoparticles. <b>Chitosan</b> proves to be effective against bacteria, viruses, and fungi, however it is more effective against fungi and viruses than bacteria. The positively charged <b>chitosan</b> nanoparticles interact with the negatively charged cell membrane, which causes an increase in membrane permeability and eventually the intracellular components leak and rupture.|$|E
25|$|Pesticides - Biopesticides such as <b>chitosan</b> {{have been}} tested for {{protection}} against the mountain pine beetle, and pesticides such as carbaryl, permethrin, and bifenthrin are used for smaller area applications.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Jim Linden, Microbiologist, Colorado State University, {{stated the}} <b>chitosan</b> {{increased}} resin pitch-outs {{to push the}} mountain pine beetle out of the tree, preventing the MPB from entering the pine tree and spreading blue stain mold.|$|E
25|$|A molding {{technique}} {{was created by}} Wang et al. for forming a nerve guidance conduit with a multi-channel inner matrix and an outer tube wall from <b>chitosan.</b> In their 2006 study, Wang et al. threaded acupuncture needles through a hollow <b>chitosan</b> tube, where they are {{held in place by}} fixing, on either end, patches created using CAD. A <b>chitosan</b> solution is then injected into the tube and solidified, after which the needles are removed, creating longitudinally oriented channels. A representative scaffold was then created for characterization with 21 channels using acupuncture needles of 400µm in diameter. Upon investigation under a microscope, the channels were found to be approximately circular with slight irregularities; all channels were aligned with the inner diameter of the outer tube wall. It was confirmed by micro-CT imaging that the channels went through {{the entire length of the}} scaffold. Under water absorption, the inner and outer diameters of the scaffold became larger, but the channel diameters did not vary significantly, which is necessary for maintaining the scaffold shape that guides neurite extension. The inner structure provides an increase in compressive strength compared to a hollow tube alone, which can prevent collapse of the scaffold onto growing neurites. Neuro-2a cells were able to growth on the inner matrix of the scaffold, and they oriented along the channels. Although this method has only been tested on <b>chitosan,</b> it can be tailored to other materials.|$|E
25|$|Another thermo-responsive gel is {{one that}} is formed by {{combining}} <b>chitosan</b> with glycerophosphate (GP) salt. This solution experiences gelation at temperatures above 37°C. Gelation of chitosan/GP is rather slow, taking half an hour to initially set and 9 more hours to completely stabilize. Gel strength varies from 67 to 1572 Pa depending on the concentration of chitosan; the lower end of this range approaches the stiffness of brain tissue. Chitosan/GP has shown success in vitro, but the addition of polylysine is needed to enhance nerve cell attachment. Polylysine was covalently bonded to <b>chitosan</b> in order to prevent it from diffusing away. Polylysine was selected because of its positive nature and high hydrophilicity, which promotes neurite growth. Neuron survival was doubled, though neurite outgrowth did not change with the added polylysine.|$|E
25|$|All {{the various}} hydrogels have {{different}} advantages and disadvantage, such as biocompatibility, protein stability, toxicity, or lifetime; for example, the gelling conditions for sol-gels may damage the protein, and, as a result, several copolymers, such as <b>chitosan,</b> may be added (making hybrid gels) or alternative monomers, such as glycol-modified tetraethoxysilane {{as it is}} more biocompatible than the commonly used methoxy- or ethoxy-modified tetraethoxysilane.|$|E
25|$|Glucosamine (C6H13NO5) is an amino {{sugar and}} a {{prominent}} precursor in the biochemical synthesis of glycosylated proteins and lipids. Glucosamine {{is part of}} the structure of the polysaccharides <b>chitosan</b> and chitin, which compose the exoskeletons of crustaceans and other arthropods, as well as the cell walls of fungi and many higher organisms. Glucosamine is one of the most abundant monosaccharides. It is produced commercially by the hydrolysis of crustacean exoskeletons or, less commonly, by fermentation of a grain such as corn or wheat.|$|E
25|$|Rotations {{of plants}} with nematode-resistant species or {{varieties}} is one means of managing parasitic nematode infestations. For example, marigolds, grown over {{one or more}} seasons (the effect is cumulative), {{can be used to}} control nematodes. Another is treatment with natural antagonists such as the fungus Gliocladium roseum. <b>Chitosan,</b> a natural biocontrol, elicits plant defense responses to destroy parasitic cyst nematodes on roots of soybean, corn, sugar beet, potato, and tomato crops without harming beneficial nematodes in the soil. Soil steaming is an efficient method to kill nematodes before planting a crop, but indiscriminately eliminates both harmful and beneficial soil fauna.|$|E
25|$|Scaffolds {{may also}} be {{constructed}} from natural materials: in particular different derivatives of the extracellular matrix have been studied to evaluate their ability to support cell growth. Proteic materials, such as collagen or fibrin, and polysaccharidic materials, like <b>chitosan</b> or glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), have all proved suitable in terms of cell compatibility, but some issues with potential immunogenicity still remains. Among GAGs hyaluronic acid, possibly in combination with cross linking agents (e.g. glutaraldehyde, water-soluble carbodiimide, etc.), {{is one of the}} possible choices as scaffold material. Functionalized groups of scaffolds may be useful in the delivery of small molecules (drugs) to specific tissues. Another form of scaffold under investigation is decellularised tissue extracts whereby the remaining cellular remnants/extracellular matrices act as the scaffold. Recently a range of nanocomposites biomaterials are fabricated by incorporating nanomaterials within polymeric matrix to engineer bioactive scaffolds.|$|E

500|$|The Ocean Pavilion, an {{installation}} from 2014, included a water-based fabrication platform where structures were {{built out of}} <b>chitosan,</b> a water-soluble organic fiber similar to chitin.

Both chitin and <b>chitosan</b> are synthesized and extruded at the plasma membrane.|$|E
2500|$|... glucans: glucose {{polymers}} {{that function}} to cross-link chitin or <b>chitosan</b> polymers. β-glucans are glucose molecules linked via β-(1,3)- or β-(1,6)- bonds and provide rigidity {{to the cell}} wall while α-glucans are defined by α-(1,3)- and/or α-(1,4) bonds and function {{as part of the}} matrix.|$|E
2500|$|... "Chitosan", a {{commercial}} flocculant, {{more commonly used}} for water purification, is far more expensive. The powdered shells of crustaceans are processed to acquire chitin, a polysaccharide found in the shells, from which <b>chitosan</b> is derived via de-acetylation. Water that is more brackish, or saline requires larger amounts of flocculant. Flocculation is often too expensive for large operations.|$|E
2500|$|... lyophilizing and wire-heating {{process is}} another method of {{creating}} longitudinally oriented channels, developed by Huang et al. (2005). A <b>chitosan</b> and acetic acid solution was frozen around nickel-copper (Ni-Cu) wires in a liquid nitrogen trap; subsequently the wires were heated and removed. Ni-Cu wires were chosen {{because they have}} a high resistance level. Temperature-controlled lyophilizers were used to sublimate the acetic acid. There was no evidence of the channels merging or splitting. After lyophilizing, scaffold dimensions shrunk causing channels to be a bit smaller than the wire used. The scaffolds were neutralized to a physiological pH value using a base, which had dramatic effects on the porous structure. Weaker bases kept the porous structure uniform, but stronger base made it uncontrollable. The technique used here can be slightly modified to accommodate other polymers and solvents.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrogels {{have been}} {{extensively}} studied, {{mainly in the}} entrapment of small molecules for drug delivery, including cases where the hydrogel nanoparticles slowly release the drug to a targeted site. Hydrogels can be classified [...] according their polymers constituents, which can be natural (Hyaluronan, alginic acid, pectin, , chondroitin sulfate, dextran and dextran [...] sulphate, <b>chitosan,</b> polylysine, [...] collagen, carboxymethyl chitin, fibrin, agarose, pullulan), or synthetic (PEG, PLA, PLGA, PCL, PHB, PVA, PNVP, P(HEMA), p(biscarboxy-phenoxy-phosphazene), p(GEMA-sulfate), and others), or a hybrid of the two. In addition to organic hydrogels there are sol-gels, which are oxygen-bridged silicates (or titanium oxide), that polymerise in water. An additional classification can be by method of polymerization, which can be physical (freezing or heating) or chemical (γ-ray, oxygen or photo-induced radical polymerization {{in the case of}} acrylates, vinyls and acrylamides).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chitosan</b> is a deacetylated {{derivative}} of chitin.

[...] One difference between chitin and <b>chitosan</b> is that <b>chitosan</b> is soluble in acidic aqueous solutions. <b>Chitosan</b> is easier to process that chitin, but it is less stable {{because it is more}} hydrophilic and has pH sensitivity.

5000|$|<b>Chitosan</b> {{hemostatic}} {{agents are}} often <b>chitosan</b> salts made from mixing <b>chitosan</b> with an organic acid (such as succinic or lactic acid). The hemostatic agent works by {{an interaction between}} the cell membrane of erythrocytes (negative charge) and the protonated <b>chitosan</b> (positive charge) leading to involvement of platelets and rapid thrombus formation. The <b>chitosan</b> salts can be mixed with other materials {{to make them more}} absorbent (such as mixing with alginate), or to vary the rate of solubility and bioabsorbability of the <b>chitosan</b> salt. The <b>chitosan</b> salts are biocompatible and biodegradable making them useful as absorbable haemostats. The protonated <b>chitosan</b> is broken down by lysozyme in the body to glucosamine [...] and the conjugate base of the acid (such as lactate or succinate), substances naturally found in the body. The <b>chitosan</b> salt may be placed on an absorbable backing. The absorbable backing may be synthetic (for instance made from existing absorbable suture materials e.g. Tephaflex polymer) or natural (e.g. cellulose or gelled/solidified honey). In addition to salts, hydrogel-based <b>chitosan</b> bandages have been developed to treat burn wounds. Burns are similar to other wounds, but are problematic because they are associated with membrane destabilization, energy depletion, and hypoxia, all of which can cause severe tissue necrosis if not treated properly or quickly enough. Chitosan-gelation bandages using nanofibrin {{have been shown to be}} more durable than ointments, while still allowing gas exchange at the cell surface.|$|E
5000|$|Agricultural {{applications}} of <b>chitosan</b> can reduce environmental stress due to drought and soil deficiencies, strengthen seed vitality, improve stand quality, increase yields, and reduce fruit decay of vegetables, fruits and citrus crops [...] Horticultural application of <b>chitosan</b> increases blooms and extends {{the life of}} cut flowers and Christmas trees. The US Forest Service has conducted research on <b>chitosan</b> to control pathogens in pine trees and increase resin pitch outflow which resists pine beetle infestation. <b>Chitosan</b> has a rich history of being researched for applications in agriculture and horticulture {{dating back to the}} 1980s. [...] By 1989, <b>chitosan</b> salt solutions were applied to crops for improved freeze protection or to crop seed for seed priming.

50|$|In an {{experimental}} {{model of the}} digestive tract, <b>chitosan</b> was shown to interact with oil, which inhibited duodenal absorption and enhanced lipid excretion.

50|$|Compound collagen-based {{scaffolds}} {{have been}} developed {{in an attempt to}} improve the function of these scaffolds for tissue engineering. An example of a compound collagen scaffold is the collagen-chitosan matrix. <b>Chitosan</b> is a polysaccharide that is chemically similar to cellulose. Unlike collagen, <b>chitosan</b> biodegrades relatively slowly. However, <b>chitosan</b> is not very biocompatible with fibroblasts. To improve the stability of scaffolds containing gelatin or collagen and the biocompatibility of <b>chitosan</b> is made by crosslinking the two; they compensate for each other's shortcomings.|$|E
5000|$|Supposed {{to limit}} fat {{absorption}} in the body, <b>chitosan</b> may {{be sold in}} tablet form as a [...] "fat binder". A Cochrane meta-analysis that evaluated clinical trials performed with dietary <b>chitosan</b> over a minimum of four weeks, found that body weight, blood pressure and cholesterol-related parameters changed only in some low-quality trials, indicating a minor effect on body weight. Other higher quality trials indicated no significant effect of <b>chitosan</b> and no clinical justification for advising overweight patients to take <b>chitosan</b> supplements.|$|E

50|$|<b>Chitosan</b> hemostats are topical agents {{composed}} of <b>chitosan</b> and its salts. <b>Chitosan</b> bonds with platelets and {{red blood cells}} to form a gel-like clot which seals a bleeding vessel. Unlike other hemostat technologies its action {{does not require the}} normal hemostatic pathway and therefore continues to function even when anticoagulants like heparin are present.|$|E
50|$|The {{fabrication}} of large objects with <b>chitosan</b> applies concepts from Shrilk, a <b>chitosan</b> material that replicates insect cuticle and a fibroin protein from silk for uses in bioengineering.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chitosan</b> {{can also}} be used in water {{processing}} engineering {{as a part of a}} filtration process. <b>Chitosan</b> causes the fine sediment particles to bind together, and is subsequently removed with the sediment during sand filtration.
