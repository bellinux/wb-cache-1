The most active were the {{local chapter of}} the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature and Nature and Youth, who stated that the road would have serious consequences for the local boat traffic to the recreational islands of Føyno and Nautøy. Instead, they recommended that the municipalities chose a pontoon bridge. Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who argued to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections, to ensure that the municipal councils had backing in the public.

Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was overwhelming support. However, in southern Bømlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry, as they would have a much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.|$|E
5|$|From 1988, {{environmental}} groups started opposing the Triangle Link. The most active was the {{local chapter of}} the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, who stated that the road would have a negative impact for local boat traffic to the recreational islands of Føyno and Nautøy. They therefore recommended that the municipalities select a pontoon bridge. Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections to ensure that the municipal councils had backing in the public. Also Gisle Tjong, a local citizen, opposed the project, stating that the risk was too large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last. He argued that the tolls <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advance tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the saved-up funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was near consensus in favor of the project. The exception was in southern Bømlø, where there was concerns that their ferry service to the mainland would be terminated, which would result in considerably longer driving time to Haugesund. Concerns were also raised regarding people with fear of tunnels and proposals were made to keep a ferry service for such people.|$|E

500|$|Despite the America-specific references, {{the filmmakers}} have always {{referred}} to the film as adding dialogue {{to a set of}} issues much broader than the US administration.

500|$|The term 'heavy metal', as it {{was used}} by Lester Bangs and Dave Marsh at Creem, {{referred}} to a sound best exemplified by albums such as Led Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin II, Deep Purple's Deep Purple in Rock, and Black Sabbath's Paranoid. An examination {{of some of the}} lyrics from bands such as these show a lack of any explicitly negative themes. Led Zeppelin's [...] "Whole Lotta Love" [...] <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> be a conversation between husband and wife, as not. Black Sabbath's [...] "Electric Funeral" [...] exactly parallels the blood red moon of the Book of Revelation by John of Patmos, while their [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] describes the ravages of drug abuse. Ozzy Osbourne could be heard preaching to his audience in the earlier song, [...] "Children of the Grave": [...] "Tell the world that love is still alive you must be brave; or the children of today are children of the grave." [...] Later, in the song [...] "In My Time of Dying", Robert Plant even pleaded to Jesus: [...] "Meet me Jesus, meet me; Meet me {{in the middle of the}} air; if my wings should fail me Lord, please meet me with another pair." [...] Perhaps not overtly Christian, but songs such as these exhibited similar themes. Early heavy metal fans were viewed by the populace as a counterculture, just as the fans of rock and roll, in general, were. Early heavy metal lyrics and themes were often accused of challenging Christian values, and as the genre grew, some bands actually did.|$|E

2500|$|Dagbladet {{commented that}} the film downplayed the left-wing {{political}} aspect {{of the book and}} instead focused on the storyline and action.

Following the presentation of the shortened and new ending version, Dagbladet stated that [...] "they <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> have kept the old one". Klassekampen praised the film for its action and accepted that it had reduced the amount of intrigue in the novel. The character of Jansen was applauded, as it showed how small an individual is against the superpowers. As the only newspaper, Klassekampen praised the film music. Variety stated that the film was [...] "a superbly mounted, convincingly told adventure thriller. Action scenes, such as the helicopter attack, are excitingly staged, and the suspense never lets up. As the rugged Tom, Helge Jordal is very good." [...] However, the magazine criticized the title.|$|E
2500|$|Tyler has {{occasionally}} been {{classified as}} a “Southern author” or a “modern American author.” [...] The Southern category apparently results {{from the fact that}} she grew up and went to college in the South.

In a rare interview with The New York Times, Tyler cited Eudora Welty as a major literary influence: [...] "Reading Eudora Welty when I was growing up showed me that very small things are often really larger than the large things". [...] However, poet and author Katha Pollitt notes, “It is hard to classify Anne Tyler’s novels. [...] They are Southern in their sure sense of family and place but lack the taste for violence and the Gothic that often characterizes self-consciously southern literature.

2500|$|With {{reference}} to the DNA tests, Witherington wrote in his blog: [...] "he most the DNA evidence can show is that several of these folks are interrelated….

Critics contend they could have been paternally related (e.g. father and daughter, or grandfather and granddaughter), or related by someone else's marriage.

2500|$|The {{most intense}} {{work on the}} book was done {{during the winter of}} 1850–1851, when Melville had changed the noise of New York City for a farm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The move may well have delayed {{finishing}} the book. During these months, he wrote several excited letters to Hawthorne, including one of June 1851 in which he summarizes his career: [...] "What I feel most moved to write, that is banned, — it will not pay. Yet, altogether, write the other way I cannot. So the product is a final hash, and all my books are botches." [...] This is the stubborn Melville who stood by Mardi and talked about his other, more commercial books with contempt. The letter also reveals how Melville experienced his development from his 25th year: [...] "Three weeks have scarcely passed, at any time between then and now, that I have not unfolded within myself. But I feel that I am now come to the inmost leaf of the bulb, and that shortly the flower must fall to the mould." [...] One other theory holds that getting to know Hawthorne first inspired him to write Ahab's tragic obsession into the book, but Bryant and Springer object that Melville already had experienced other encounters which <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> have triggered his imagination, such as the Bible's Jonah and Job, Milton's Satan, Shakespeare's King Lear, Byron's heroes.|$|E
2500|$|From 1925 to 1928 he was passionately {{involved}} with Dalí. The friendship with Lorca {{had a strong}} element of mutual passion, but Dalí [...] rejected the erotic advances of the poet. With the success of [...] "Gypsy Ballads", came an estrangement from Dalí and the breakdown of {{a love affair with}} sculptor Emilio Aladrén Perojo. These brought on an increasing depression, a situation exacerbated by his anguish over his homosexuality. He felt he was trapped between the persona of the successful author, which he was forced to maintain in public, and the tortured, authentic self, which he could only acknowledge in private. He also had the sense that he was being pigeon-holed as a [...] "gypsy poet". He wrote: [...] "The gypsies are a theme. And nothing more. I <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> be a poet of sewing needles or hydraulic landscapes. Besides, this gypsyism gives me the appearance of an uncultured, ignorant and primitive poet that you know very well I'm not. I don't want to be typecast". Growing estrangement between García Lorca and his closest friends reached its climax when surrealists Dalí and Luis Buñuel collaborated on their 1929 film Un Chien Andalou (An Andalusian Dog). García Lorca interpreted it, perhaps erroneously, as a vicious attack upon himself. At this time Dalí also met his future wife Gala. Aware of these problems (though not perhaps of their causes), García Lorca's family arranged for him to take a lengthy visit to the United States in 1929–30.|$|E
