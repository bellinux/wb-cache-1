In both materials, fatigue cracks are mostly transcollonial and tend to fracture pearlitic lamellae, so that many different micro-phenomena appear such as non-uniform crack opening displacement, micro-discontinuities, branchings, bifurcations and frequent local deflections, all of them creating a sort of microstructural roughness {{with regard to the}} fatigue crack path which is different in hot rolled bar and in the <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>wire...</b>|$|E

This paper {{analyzes}} {{the propagation of}} fatigue cracks in pearlitic steel in two materials, hot rolled bar and <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>wire.</b> The experimental procedure consisted of fatigue tests on cylindrical bars under tensile loading, using steps with decreasing amplitude of stress and constant stress range during each step.

The fracto-metallographic analysis shows how the microstructural anisotropy of the drawn steel (consequence of the drawing process itself) creates {{a change in the}} fracture crack path in the form of local micro-deflections (and thus multiaxially-driven fatigue propagation at the very local microscale). The net fatigue surface increases with cold drawing due to the higher angle of crack micro-deflections {{in the case of the}} heavily drawn material, thereby allowing a correction of the Paris law curves by considering the real (experimental) fatigue crack path (multi-deflected; locally multiaxial) and the theoretical fatigue crack path (non deflected; locally uniaxial) ...|$|E

A thick wire with a diameter of 17. 9 mm drawn from an annealed wire with a diameter of 20. 1 mm was investigated. First, FEM simulations were performed based on a suitable model describing the boundary conditions and the exact material behavior. Due to the initial texture in the original material, the anisotropy of the material plastic behavior was taken into account {{on the basis of}} the texture measurement of the wire. Instead of the isotropic von Mises yield criterion, a texture-based anisotropic yield locus was incorporated into the model to simulate the wire drawing process and calculate residual stresses. Next, X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out at the surface of the wire to obtain the distribution of the lattice spacing versus sin(2) psi, from which the macroscopic residual stresses at the wire surface were calculated.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, the microstructure, monotonic, and cyclic response of as-drawn similar to 100 pm diameter MP 35 N low-Ti alloy wire were presented and discussed. In this sequel paper, {{the effects of}} annealing the same cold-drawn wire on microstructure and mechanical properties are examined. Specifically, segments of the wire were annealed for 1 h at 973 K, 1023 K, 1073 K, 1123 K and 1173 K in a vacuum furnace. The resulting microstructure was characterized by SEM, EBSD and TEM and compared to the asdrawn microstructure. In-situ heating in the TEM of MP 35 N ribbon in a similarly cold worked condition enabled corroboration of microstructure evolution during annealing. Annealed wires were tested monotonically and cyclically in uniaxial tension at room temperature, the latter using a stress ratio (R) of 0. 3. In addition, the annealed wires were tested cyclically at R= - 1 using the rotating beam bending fatigue test. Post-deformation structures and fracture surfaces were characterized using TEM and SEM respectively. Annealing the <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>wire</b> results in recrystallization and grain growth; the extent {{is dependent on the}} annealing temperature. Deformation twin boundaries in the as-drawn structure illustrate faceted bulging and eventually complete elimination, the microstructure evolving into fine equiaxed grains containing coarser annealing twins with no significant change in texture. Yield strength decreases rapidly with recrystallization to almost half the value of the as-drawn condition, but is accompanied by an increase in modulus (by similar to 25 %) and tensile elongation reaching 30 %. Cyclic response by the way of S-N curves is not enhanced by annealing on an absolute stress scale (due to the loss in yield strength) although the annealed wires are cyclically superior when the stress data are normalized by yield stress.

40|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>drawing</b> steel <b>wires</b> {{lead to an}} {{increase}} of their mechanical strength and to a drop of their ductility. The increase of their mechanical strength has long been related to the reduction of the various material scales by plastic deformation, but the mechanisms controlling their elongation to failure have received relatively little attention. It is usually found that heavily deformed materials show a tendency to plastic strain localization and necking. However, in this paper it is shown that, though the steel wires are plastically deformed up to strain levels as high as 3. 5, a significant capability of plastic deformation is preserved in as-drawn wires. This apparent contradiction is resolved by the existence of residual stresses inside the wire. Finite element analyses have been conducted in order to show that residual stresses, inherited from the drawing process, are sufficient to produce a significant hardening effect during a post-drawing tensile test, without introducing any hardening in the local material behaviour. The main conclusion of this paper is that once thematerial has lost its hardening capabilities, residual stresses, inherited from the process, control the elongation of <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>wires.</b> The finite element method allowed also the determination of the residual stress field that would lead to the best agreement between the simulated and the experimental stress strain curve of as-drawn wires...|$|R

40|$|Steel in {{concrete}} is normally protected against corrosion {{due to a}} thin and dense passive layer formed in the alkaline medium of the pore solution of concrete (pH approx. 13. 3). In the presence of chloride at the steel surface (due to de-icing or seawater salt) the passive layer breaks down when a critical chloride content is exceeded (c(Cl(crit)) and corrosion of the reinforcement can be initiated, causing deterioration of the reinforcement and thus of bridges or parking decks etc. This critical chloride content of black steel reinforcement {{is strongly dependent on}} the pH-value of the pore solution and on the structure of the interfacial concrete zone as well as on exposure- and steel-related parameters. Former investigations on the corrosion of steel fibres {{in concrete}} containing chlorides have led {{to the conclusion that the}} critical chloride content of steel fibres in concrete is much higher compared to the one of normal reinforcement, although identical steel and concrete compositions are used. In order to clarify the mechanisms of this increased corrosion resistance of steel fibres compared to rebars electrochemical tests have been carried out in artificial pore solution as well as in mortar and concrete containing chlorides. Besides established electrochemical methods (determination of polarisation resistance and current density-potential-curves) Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) as well as Electrochemical Noise (EN) have been applied to investigate the passivity of steel fibres, <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>wires</b> with different degrees of drawing and reinforcement. In particular potentiostep tests of steel electrodes in pore solution at different chloride concentrations have been conducted by simultaneously measuring the Electrochemical Current Noise to clarify the passivation and the depassivation mechanisms. Additional investigations using Scanning Electron (SEM) and Atomic Force (AFM) Microscopes as well as numerical simulations on the corrosion kinetics rounded out the experimental design. The results show a significant reduction of the decisive noise signals and the capacitive actions of the passive layer of passive steel fibres and <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>wires</b> in pore solution. Considering additionally the depassivation of fibres and wires at clearly higher chloride contents, the formation of a more homogeneous and hence more stabile passive layer of steel fibres and wires can be concluded. The passivation and depassivation of steel fibres and wires in mortar and concrete is strongly dependent on the corrosion behaviour within the die scars on the fibre surface caused by the production process and filled with drawing grease, which at least decelerate the passivation. Thus localized secluded corrosion spots within the die scars can be formed with marginal corrosion rates due to the diffusion inhibition caused by the dense interfacial contact zone steel/concrete. These "sleeping corrosion spots" are unlikely to cause visual damages. Hence in practice harmful corrosion of steel fibres in uncracked concrete containing high content of chlorides is improbable inside the structure. But near the concrete surface corrosion can occur due to leaching processes of the concrete, which can be calculative estimated. The durability of steel fibres after the onset of corrosion is strongly dependent on the activity of the cathode. Though due to the small section of the fibres even low corrosion rates are sufficient to restrict the durability of corroding steel fibres...|$|R

Fretting tests on <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> steel <b>wires</b> were performed in this study for two different configurations (in air, and in water). For each configuration, the experimental results permit to identify the friction coefficients and the different sliding regimes (partial slip regime, mixed regime and gross slip regime). It is shown that, for small strokes, water does not change the contact conditions, and acts as a lubricant for higher strokes. The friction coefficients in gross slip regime and at the transition are strongly reduced in water compared to air. Damage mechanisms, in particular cracking, are observed for both environments. They depend on the number of fretting cycles and on the relative displacements between the wires. The immersion in water seems to reduce the cracking damage, for higher strokes...|$|R
