In this paper, we investigate the contribution of semantic hierarchies for hierarchical image classification. We propose first a new method based on the hierarchy structure to train efficiently hierarchical classifiers. Our method, named One-Versus-Opposite-Nodes, allows decomposing the problem in several independent tasks and therefore scales well with large database. We also propose two methods for computing a hierarchical decision function that serves to annotate new image samples.

40|$|Multiple {{classifier}} combination (or ensemble method) {{has been}} shown to be very helpful in improving the performance of classification over single classifier approach. The diversity among base classifiers (or ensemble members) is important when constructing a classifier ensemble. Although there have been several measures of diversity, but there is no reliable measure that can predict the ensemble accuracy. The base <b>classifiers</b> <b>accuracy</b> will increase when the diversity decreases and this is known as the accuracy-diversity dilemma. This paper presents a new method to measure diversity in classifier ensembles. Furthermore another parameter which based on this diversity measure is defined. It is hope that the new parameter will be able to predict the ensemble accuracy. Based on experimental results on classification of 84 samples of fruit images using nearest mean classifier ensembles, it {{has been shown}} that there is a positive linear relationship between the new parameter and the ensemble accuracy.

Following the wavelet decomposition of vibration signals into a few sub-bands of interest, the standard deviation of obtained wavelet coefficients is extracted as a representative feature. Then, the feature space dimension is optimally reduced to two using scatter matrices.

40|$|AbstractThere {{are various}} machine {{learning}} algorithms for extracting patterns from data; but recently, decision combination has become popular to improve accuracy over single learner systems. The fundamental idea behind combining the decisions of an ensemble of classifiers is that different classifiers most probably misclassify different patterns and by suitably combining the decisions of complementary <b>classifiers,</b> <b>accuracy</b> can be improved. In this paper, we investigate two kinds of classifier systems which are capable of estimating how much to weight each base classifier dynamically; during the calculation of the overall output for a given test data instance: (1) In ‘referee-based system’, a referee is associated with each classifier which learns the area of expertise of its associated classifier and weights it accordingly. (2) However, ‘gating system’ learns to partition the input space among all classifiers. Each referee in referee-based system learns a two-class problem (i. e., whether to use or not to use a classifier) whereas a gating system learns an L-class problem assigning the input to one of L base classifiers. Our analysis on 20 datasets from different domains and a classifier pool including 21 base learning algorithms reveals that the gating system tends to concentrate on {{a few of the}} base classifiers whereas a use of referees leads to a more balanced use of the base classifiers. Moreover, in the case of referees, it is better to use a small subset of base classifiers, instead of a single one. The study shows that, by using well-trained selection unit (referee or gating), we can get as high accuracy as using all the base classifiers (to combine their decisions) with drastic {{decrease in the number of}} base classifiers used, and also improve accuracy. The improvement is significant especially in cases when none of the base classifiers has high accuracy and it indicates that selecting classifiers appears promising as a means of solving hard learning problems...|$|E
