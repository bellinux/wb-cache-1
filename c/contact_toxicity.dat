Pumiliotoxins are highly toxic and are believed to protect frogs against predators. Their potential activity against ectoparasites, however, has not been investigated. We tested female yellow fever mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) for responses to 8 -hydroxy- 8 -methyl- 6 -(2 ′-methylhexylidene) - 1 -azabicyclo[4. 3. 0]nonane, designated pumiliotoxin 251 D [PTX (+) - 251 D], a skin alkaloid present in all genera of dendrobatids and in other anurans, and to its unnatural enantiomer, PTX (−) - 251 D. Both enantiomers of PTX 251 D presented on silicone feeding membranes reduced landing and feeding by A. aegypti, but PTX (+) - 251 D did so at lower concentrations. PTX (+) - 251 D also induced toxicosis, shown when mosquitoes failed to fly off membranes.

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} essential oil of Etlingera yunnanensis rhizomes and its contact and repellent activities against Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) and Liposcelis bostrychophila (Badonnel) were investigated. The essential oil obtained from E. yunnanensis rhizomes with hydrodistillation was performed by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The main components of the essential oil were identified to be estragole (65. 2 %), β-caryophyllene (6. 4 %), 1, 8 -cineole (6. 4 %), limonene (5. 2 %), and α-pinene (2. 4 %). It {{was found that the}} essential oil of E. yunnanensis rhizomes possessed <b>contact</b> <b>toxicity</b> against T. castaneum and L. bostrychophila (LD 50 = 23. 33 μg/adult and LD 50 = 47. 38 μg/cm 2, respectively). Estragole, 1, 8 -cineole, and limonene exhibited stronger <b>contact</b> <b>toxicity</b> (LD 50 values of 20. 41, 18. 86, and 13. 40 μg/adult, respectively) than β-caryophyllene (LD 50 = 41. 72 μg/adult) against T. castaneum adults. Estragole possessed stronger <b>contact</b> <b>toxicity</b> (LD 50 = 30. 22 µg/cm 2) than β-caryophyllene, 1, 8 -cineole, and limonene (LD 50 values of 74. 11, 321. 20, and 239. 62 μg/adult, respectively) against L. bostrychophila adults. Repellency of the crude oil was also evaluated. The essential oil and constituents possessed strong repellent activity against T. castaneum adults. The four individual constituents showed weaker repellent activity than the essential oil against L. bostrychophila adults. The results indicated that the essential oil of E. yunnanensis rhizomes and the individual constituents had the potential to be developed as a natural insecticide and repellent for the control of T. castaneum and L. bostrychophila...|$|E

40|$|In summary, {{most of the}} {{experimental}} work of my PhD thesis {{has been devoted to}} develop novel silver complexes with suitable physico-chemical properties for their employment as additives in antimicrobial composite materials with persistent activity. Among the most relevant results, the silver coordination polymers seem to be the most effective for their application as additives, due to their high and broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. Such activity is persistent in time, likely because of a <b>contact</b> mechanism of <b>toxicity</b> against bacteria, due to exposed silver centers within the polynuclear chain, which are able to attract the negatively charged cell membranes of bacteria altering their membrane potential and provoking their death. In any case, the release of silver ions from the composite material seems very limited or absent, thanks to the insolubility of such silver coordination polymers in almost all solvents and water, an essential feature for their application as additives for plastics. Future developments of this research will be directed to optimize the homogeneity of the composites' surfaces by changing the substituents in the HQR proligands with the aim of increasing their hydrophobicity and solubility in the polymeric matrices...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the in vitro inhibition of several classes of human lymphocyte-mediated lysis by antisera from {{mice and rats}} immunized with concanavalin A-stimulated human T-enriched lymphocytes. The inhibitory antibodies in these antisera recognized molecules {{on the surface of}} cytotoxic lymphocytes, and did not bind to B-cell lines. Experiments were performed to demonstrate that these antisera were not inhibiting cytolysis by trivial mechanisms such as (i) masking of target cell antigens by anti-target cell antibodies, (ii) agglutinating effector cells, thereby preventing effector-target cell <b>contact,</b> or (iii) <b>toxicity</b> to the effector cells. Dextran dispersion experiments revealed that these antisera inhibit the post-conjugate formation phase of cytolysis mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These antisera inhibited natural killer-like cytotoxicity and lectin-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity as well as lysis mediated by both mixed cell culture-generated cytotoxic T lymphocytes and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte cell lines. These findings suggest that these in vitro systems of cell-mediated lysis may share a common step; however the different classes of cytolysis may have been inhibited by separate antibodies in the antisera. This rapid reproducible method of generating inhibitory antisera will facilitate the study of the molecules involved in the post-conjugate formation phase of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated lysis. © 1982...|$|R
30|$|Because CPY {{is used as}} a {{pesticide}} {{to protect}} crops from damage by arthropods, it is obviously toxic to terrestrial stages of insects. This is a benefit of use and is not considered an adverse effect. However, toxicity to valued arthropods can be considered an adverse effect and, {{in the case of the}} honeybee, was characterized in a risk assessment of CPY [99]. CPY is toxic to the honeybee by direct <b>contact</b> (topical <b>toxicity)</b> with the spray and also via the oral route. The former route of exposure is only relevant when bees are present during or shortly after spraying and is mitigated by restrictions on the label (see the ‘Reports of toxicity under current conditions of use' section below). Topical 24 - to 48 -h LD 50 values for formulated CPY range from 0.024 to 0.54 (geometric mean = 0.123) μg a.i./bee and 0.059 to 0.115 (geometric mean = 0.082) μg a.i./bee for the technical product. Oral 24 - to 48 -h LD 50 s ranged from 0.114 μg a.i./bee for the technical to 0.11 to 1.1 (geometric mean = 0.36) μg a.i./bee for the formulated material [99]. Significant toxicity to honeybees has only been associated with direct exposure during spraying and/or during foraging for nectar and/or pollen in recently treated fields (0 to 3 days post spray). Toxicity has not been reported to be caused by CPY outside the foraging range of the bees, and residues in samples of brood comb have not been casually linked to colony collapse disorder [102]. There is no evidence to suggest that small concentrations measured outside the areas of use are toxic to bees or other beneficial insects. As the honeybee is found in the EU, North America, and other parts of the globe, there is no need to consider this species differently across locations. The conclusions regarding toxicity to honeybees thus apply to considerations of POPs and PBTs.|$|R
