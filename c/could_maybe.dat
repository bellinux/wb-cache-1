25|$|Functionally, AR NTD {{plays the}} primary role in {{regulating}} target gene transcription activation and mediating various receptor-protein and intra-receptor N-terminal and C-terminal interactions. Therefore, modulation of NTD function {{is considered an}} efficient strategy to target AR action. Among various functional domains in different nuclear receptors, NTD is the least conserved and so <b>could</b> <b>maybe</b> become the best target site for NTD antagonists to achieve AR specificity. However the structural features of the NTD are undetermined due to {{a high degree of}} flexibility in its conformation. Both biochemical and circular dichroism spectroscopy analysis suggest that AR NTD is highly disordered under native conditions, making it a difficult target for drug discovery.|$|E

My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad.

Brodie scored York's equaliser in the following match away to Salisbury City on 29 November 2008 with a goal in the 83rd minute, which finished as a 1–1 draw in Martin Foyle's first match as manager. After picking up a yellow card against Salisbury, his fifth of the season for York, he was handed a one-match suspension which saw him miss the match against Grays Athletic. He scored with a 25-yard shot on his return away to Histon on 9 December 2008, which finished as a 1–1 draw. He scored twice against Northwich in the FA Trophy first round as York progressed with a 2–0 away victory, Foyle rating Brodie's first as the [...] "goal of the season". Foyle also stated his desire for Brodie to stay at York, after continued reports of interest from Barrow. Barrow joint-manager David Bayliss said he was unlikely to table a bid for Brodie in January 2009, claiming [...] "If we had {{a hell of a}} lot of money we <b>could</b> <b>maybe</b> get him away but we haven't". Foyle responded by saying he had no intention of selling Brodie.|$|E

500|$|Imperial Bedrooms {{opens with}} an {{acknowledgement}} from Clay, the main character, {{that both the}} Less Than Zero novel and its film adaption are actual representational works within the narrative of his life: [...] "The movie {{was based on a}} book by someone we knew... It was labeled fiction but only a few details had been altered and our names weren't changed and there was nothing in it that hadn't happened." [...] The Los Angeles Times described this as a [...] "nifty little trick", as it allows Ellis to establish the newer book [...] "as the primary narrative, one that trumps Ellis as author and the real world." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle calls it a [...] "neat trick of authorial self-abnegation". Another reviewer describes it as Ellis at [...] "his most ambitious", a [...] "Philip Rothian, doppelgänger gambit", making his new narrator [...] "the real Clay" [...] and the other an imposter. This allows Ellis to skilfully, [...] "with writerly jujitsu", acknowledge Robert Downey Jr.'s popular performance as Julian in the moralistic 1987 film, in which he died; Ellis appreciates the adaptation as a [...] "milestone in a lot of ways". The device also allows the novelist to insert self-critique; The Sunday Times reviewer notes that Imperial Bedrooms finds its characters [...] "still a little sore at their depiction as inarticulate zombies". John Crace, in his [...] "digested read" [...] of Imperial Bedrooms, insinuates through parody that [...] "the author" [...] of the metafictional Less Than Zero is also meant to be Ellis, describing him in Clay's voice as [...] "too immersed in the passivity of writing and too pleased with his own style to bother with many commas to admit it so he wrote me into the story as the man who was too frightened to love." [...] With regard to the opening narrative conceit, Ellis queries [...] "Is it complication ... or is it clarification?", opining that it certainly is the latter for Clay. Even though Ellis never names himself explicitly in the book, he conceded to Lawson that one can [...] "guess [...] is who the Clay of Imperial Bedrooms is referring to." [...] Ellis did, however, reveal that he had not decided when writing the novel whether Clay was referring to him or not. Eileen Battersby likened Bedrooms to Lunar Park (2005), cited his use of [...] "self-consciousness as a device." [...] This device was picked up on by several other critics—in particular, Vice noted that [...] "the scatological violence of American Psycho" [...] and [...] "the otherworldly terror of Lunar Park" [...] had here been combined. Ellis himself raised the [...] "sequel" [...] question, commenting [...] "...I don't think it is [...] Well, I mean, it is and it isn't. It's narrated by him, sure. But I guess I <b>could</b> <b>maybe</b> have switched the names around and it could stand alone." ...|$|E

40|$|Place {{branding}} might, <b>could,</b> and <b>maybe</b> even {{should play}} a central role in urban and regional governance. The vantage point of this chapter is that every place is a brand and that the processes of nonstandard regionalization that can be witnessed all over Europe create new places and, thus, new place brands. When employing place branding to these new types of regions, however, the traditional meta-geographies cannot be ignored. In this chapter, the aim is to take a first step to bring some order into the chaos. To this end, three categories of nonstandard regionalization are proposed and compared concerning place branding...|$|R
