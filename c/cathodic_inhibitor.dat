30|$|Liquid-phase inhibitors can {{be further}} divided into three subtypes that are anodic, <b>cathodic</b> and mixed <b>inhibitors.</b> Anodic inhibitors are those inhibitors that prevent {{corrosion}} by forming a protective layer of oxide film on the metal surface. They are also known as passivators, and these inhibitors alter the anodic reactions in the cell [61]. The process of controlling corrosion either by decreasing the reduction rate or by precipitating selective areas of cathodic region (cathodic preceptors) are termed as <b>cathodic</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> In simple words, we can also describe <b>cathodic</b> <b>inhibitors</b> as the chemical compounds that can decrease the corrosion rate of a metal or an alloy, when added to a certain liquid or gas [58, 59, 60, 61, 62]. The compounds which are neither anodic nor cathodic, i.e. compounds which show the characteristics of both anodic and <b>cathodic</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are termed as mixed inhibitors. On an average 80 % organic compounds are mixed inhibitors. They protect metal {{by the process of}} physical adsorption, chemisorption and film formation. They also reduce the cathodic and anodic reactions to work [58, 59].|$|R
