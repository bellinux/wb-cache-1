50|$|Sparse {{trees and}} savanna are forests with lower canopy cover of trees. They occur principally {{in areas of}} {{transition}} from forested to non-forested landscapes. The two major zones in which these ecosystems occur are in the boreal region and in the seasonally dry tropics. At high latitudes, north of the main zone of boreal forest, growing conditions are not adequate to maintain a continuous <b>closed</b> <b>forest</b> <b>cover,</b> so tree cover is both sparse and discontinuous. This vegetation is variously called open taiga, open lichen woodland, and forest tundra. A savanna is a mixed woodland grassland ecosystem characterized by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close. The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken herbaceous layer consisting primarily of grasses. Savannas maintain an open canopy despite a high tree density.|$|E
30|$|Some {{limitations}} of this study are related to the use of turbidity as a water quality indicator. Land use is most likely the most relevant factor that influence turbidity changes in streams (ECI [2014]). However, turbidity is subject to natural physical and biological variations even if the watershed is forested. The physical factors relate particularly to erosion processes, landslides, and mudslides after heavy rainfalls. These accelerated slope processes that are associated with high sediment loads and turbidity can even take place under <b>closed</b> <b>forest</b> <b>cover,</b> as seen for example during the 2011 mudslides and floods (Nehren et al. [2014]). The nature of soils and geology in the watershed (e.g. erosion of the riverbed) also determines how easily erosion might occur (ECI [2014]).|$|E

The sites lie upon an altitudinal transect from around 70 metres O. D. on the Cleaveland Plain in the west of the region to about 235 metres O.

Apart from a proposed three stage oscillation of interstadial rank within the Late-glacial period, the normal sequence of a predominantly open Late Weichselian vegetation followed by a largely <b>closed</b> <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> in early Post-glacial time is encountered. Differences existing between lowland and upload habitats at particular times are explained in terms of ecological (mainly climatic and edaphic) factors. The later Post-glacial period is considered in the context of Cleveland’s suitability as a dwelling place for prehistoric and early historic men, and the effects of his successive occupations upon the natural vegetation cover are discussed as late in time as reliable ecological evidence permits. It is suggested that the earliest settlers in the region may have had considerably greater effects upon their environment than has formerly been credited to them, and that the uplands had reached a stage of ecological imbalance by early historic time, the lowlands achieving this somewhat later and with a lesser degree of permanent and not easily reversible change...|$|E

We sampled fish in 50 m reaches during August 2001 and calculated catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) by taxonomic, distributional, trophic, reproductive, and thermal metrics. We assigned streams to reforestation categories based on cluster analysis of years 1950 and 1993 near-stream <b>forest</b> <b>cover.</b> The relationship between <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> and assemblage structure was asses-sed using analysis of variance to identify differences in fish CPUE in five <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> categories.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{feasibility}} of <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> mapping and the delineation of deforestation using Japanese Earth Resource Satellite (JERS- 1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The assessment is carried out at five test sites in Germany (Thuringia), the UK (Kielder), Sweden (Remningstorp and Brattåker) and Russia (Chunsky). These temperate and boreal sites all have high <b>forest</b> <b>cover,</b> but with different forestry management practices. The stands at the Swedish, Russian and UK sites are harvested by clearcutting, while in Thuringia, thinning is the predominant practice. Man-made deforestation is characterised in SAR imagery by regular geometric patterns which can be segmented and classified for data analysis. This reduces the statistical effects of SAR speckle. The procedure for mapping deforested areas exploits time series of SAR images, taken from the period 1992 - 1998 during which JERS was operational. Two different approaches were developed. The first detects <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> separately for each JERS scene, while the second takes all scenes into account simultaneously. Images are classified into forest, non-forest and deforested areas. The overall accuracy of the derived <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> map is about 90 % in acreage, and about 90 % for logging.

50|$|As of 2010, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations {{estimates}} India's <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> to {{be about}} 68 million hectares, or 22% of the country's area. The 2013 Forest Survey of India states its <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> increased to 69.8 million hectares by 2012, per satellite measurements; this represents an increase of 5,871 square kilometers of <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> in 2 years. However, the gains were primarily in northern, central and southern Indian states, while northeastern states witnessed a net loss in <b>forest</b> <b>cover</b> over 2010 to 2012.|$|R
