Starting from the local fractional visco-elastic relationship between axial stress and axial strain, it is shown that bending moment, curvature, shear, and the gradient of curvature involve fractional operators. Solution of particular example problems are studied in detail providing a correct position of mechanical boundary conditions. Moreover, it is shown that, for homogeneous beam both <b>correspondence</b> <b>principles</b> also hold in the case of Euler–Bernoulli beam with fractional constitutive law.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{three-dimensional}} isotropic fractional viscoelastic model is examined. It is shown that if different time scales for the volumetric and deviatoric components are assumed, the Poisson ratio is time varying function; in particular viscoelastic Poisson ratio {{may be obtained}} both increasing and decreasing with time. Moreover, it is shown that, from a theoretical point of view, one-dimensional fractional constitutive laws for normal stress and strain components are not correct to fit uniaxial experimental test, unless the time scale of deviatoric and volumetric are equal. Finally, the model is proved to satisfy <b>correspondence</b> <b>principles</b> also for the viscoelastic Poisson’s ratio and some issues about thermodynamic consistency of the model are addressed...|$|R
40|$|Oxford University Press, 2015. The chapter delineates a new {{approach}} to truth that falls under the category of 'pluralism within the bounds of correspondence' and illustrates it with respect to mathematical truth. Mathematical truth, like all other truths, is based on correspondence; but the route of mathematical correspondence differs from other routes of correspondence in (i) connecting mathematical truths to a special aspect of reality, namely, its formal aspect, and (ii) doing so in a complex, indirect way, rather than in a simple and direct way. The underlying idea is that an intricate mind is capable of creating intricate routes from language to reality, and this enables it to apply <b>correspondence</b> <b>principles</b> in areas for which correspondence is traditionally thought to be problematic...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{main goal}} of this work is to {{establish}} a thermo-damage-viscoelastic model for Hydroxyl-Terminated Polybutadiene (HTPB) composite propellant based on the thermodynamic theory and elastic–viscoelastic <b>correspondence</b> <b>principles.</b> The model will also consider the influence of temperatures. The parameter α which represent the damage evolution rate and the material constants a, b are defined as exponential functions of temperature T, i. e. α(T), a(T) and b(T). Relaxation tests and uniaxial constant rate tensile tests are used to acquire the model parameters, and C(S) curves of different rates under the same temperature states are considered to be overlapped in this paper, while noncoincidence under the different temperature states. Then, uniaxial constant rate tensile tests and multi-step tensile-relaxation tests are used to verify the accuracy of the model. The results show that, the model is highly accurate in describing the mechanical property of HTPB under various loading conditions, but some drawback in describing the relaxation property inside of the HTPB’s nonlinear viscoelastic segments...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} thermal {{properties}} of string gases propagating in various D-brane backgrounds in the weak-coupling limit, and at temperatures {{close to the}} Hagedorn temperature. We determine, in the canonical ensemble, whether the Hagedorn temperature is limiting or non-limiting. This depends on the dimensionality of the D-brane, {{and the size of}} the compact dimensions. We find that in many cases the non-limiting behaviour manifest in the canonical ensemble is modified to a limiting behaviour in the microcanonical ensemble and show that, when there are different systems in thermal contact, the energy flows into open strings on the `limiting' D-branes of largest dimensionality. Such energy densities may eventually exceed the D-brane intrinsic tension. We discuss possible implications of this for the survival of Dp-branes with large values of p in an early cosmological Hagedorn regime. We also discuss the general phase diagram of the interacting theory, as implied by the holographic and black-hole/string <b>correspondence</b> <b>principles.</b> Comment: 50 pages, LaTeX, 4 eps figures.

In particular, viscoelastic properties were recorded using the Rheometrics Solids Analyzer (RSA 2). Dynamic moduli (E', the storage component of the elastic modulus, and E'', the loss component of the elastic modulus) were recorded over three decades of frequency (0. 1 to 100 rad/sec) for temperatures ranging from - 150 to 150 C.

40|$|The Euler-Bernoulli {{beam theory}} is well {{established}} {{in such a way}} that engineers are very confident with the determination of stress field or def lections of the elastic beam based on this theory. Conversely Timoshenko theory is not so much used by engineers. However in such cases Euler-Bernoulli theory that n eglects the effect of transversal shear deformation leads to unacceptable results. For inst ance when dealing with the visco-elastic behaviour the shear deformations play a fundamental role. Recent studies [1]-[2] on the response evaluation of visco-elastic Euler-Bernoulli beam under quasi-static and dynamic loads, have been stressed that for better capturing the visco-elastic behavior a fractional constitutive law has to be considered. In this context it has been provided that, for homogeneous beam both <b>correspondence</b> <b>principles</b> also hold, then the study of a fractional visco-elastic Euler-Bernoulli beam may be derived from the elastic one. As aforementioned in dealing with visco-elasticity the Timoshenko beam model is more proper than Euler-Bernoulli’s one, then this paper provides important informations to engineering designers, introducing exact linking relationships between visco-elastic Euler-Bernoulli beam solutions and visco-elastic Timoshenko beam solutions. Thus the effect of transverse shear deformations may be taken into account for, without the need of a studying a more complicated model...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A method for modeling the transient stress relaxation and creep behavior of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber has been developed. The behavior of the material is characterized through the use of transient stress relaxation and creep tests. The material exhibits viscoelastic properties. Since rubber can undergo large deformations the material is modeled using nonlinear viscoelastic techniques. In particular the material has been modeled using Schapery's <b>correspondence</b> <b>principles.</b> This is similar to traditional timetemperature superposition where changes in stress or strain compress or expand the time scale. Also a method has been developed and evaluated for interrelating the creep compliance and the relaxation modulus. Using stress relaxation and creep the nonlinear viscoelastic properties of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber will be modeled. The stress relaxation tests were also used as a method to model the interrelationship between relaxation modulus and creep compliance. In addition, to support the development of constitutive modes, dynamic mechanical tests were also used to determine if the material exhibited nonlinear viscoelastic behavior...|$|R
