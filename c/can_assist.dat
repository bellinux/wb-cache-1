5|$|An {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) <b>can</b> <b>assist</b> {{in showing}} brain activity suggestive of {{an increased risk}} of seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure. It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the disease. In certain situations it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.|$|E

A wide array of alien enemies populate the game, including headcrabs, bullsquids, headcrab zombies, and Vortigaunts. The player also faces human opponents, in particular, Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU) Marines and black ops assassins who are dispatched to contain the extra-dimensional threats and silence all witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Not {{until the}} 21st century did players and analysts begin to revive Black's chances in this line. First, Watson {{showed that the}} {{disruptive}} check 9...Qh4+ was playable, the point being that after 10.g3 White is {{no longer able to}} bring the bishop on c1 to the squares g3 or h4, where it <b>can</b> <b>assist</b> in White's kingside attack. Later players such as Gashimov showed that the queen check is not mandatory, and that Black also retains good chances in the line 9...0-0 10.Nf3 Na6 11.0-0 Nb4, taking advantage of the outpost on b4.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an artificial intelligence system by which hostile human enemies react to combat. If enemies discover the player, they may take cover or call for assistance, {{and can take}} advantage of players when they are distracted, out of ammunition, or in a fight. Player companions, such as Ellie, <b>can</b> <b>assist</b> in combat by throwing objects at threats to stun them, announcing the location of unseen enemies, or using a knife and pistol to attack enemies.|$|E
50|$|The IAAF {{considers}} marks set at {{high altitude}} as acceptable for record consideration. However, high altitude <b>can</b> significantly <b>assist</b> sprint performances.

5|$|During their travels {{across the}} Wastelands, the player can be {{accompanied}} by a single non-player character (NPC) companion, who <b>can</b> <b>assist</b> in combat. Which companion can accompany the player depends on who they have encountered that can join them; it is possible to not encounter all depending on how the game is played. Only one companion may travel with the player, and should they wish to take another with them, the first must be dismissed (either voluntarily by the player or as a consequence of other events) or die in combat. One unique companion the player can have, that can allow a third to join without issue, is a dog named Dogmeat, who can be killed during the game if the player misuses him or places him in a severely dangerous situation; the release of the Broken Steel DLC, makes it possible to replace Dogmeat, provided the player acquires a Perk that grants the opportunity of getting another dog.|$|E
5|$|The Dove Street Festival of Lights â€“ Begun 1990, the Dove Street Festival of Lights {{takes place}} each December.

Previously, the Glee Club of the Miami University of Ohio serenaded residents with holiday songs. Town volunteers collect donations of money, food and toys at the festival that are given to The Deep Well Project, a local charity.

40|$|This paper {{undertakes}} {{a detailed}} market segmentation {{analysis of the}} demand for GM derived animal foods in the UK {{with the aim of}} illustrating how this analysis can provide distinct information that <b>can</b> <b>assists</b> in evaluating the welfare impacts of proposed changes to the EU's GM labelling policy. The specific modelling approach employed was the latent segment (LS) model which allows for the simultaneous determination and explanation of both segment membership and product choice. Based on psychometric and demographic variables as well as choice data, the LS model was able to identify three distinct and behaviourally consistent consumer segments. Further, the LS model was found to outperform alternative econometric approaches for accounting for preference heterogeneity. Finally, our analysis shows how it can yield distinct information over the segmented nature of the food market that <b>can</b> uniquely <b>assist</b> both European policy makers in designing GM labelling regimes and public awareness campaigns as well as the agricultural and food industry in developing pricing, marketing and new product development strategies. ...|$|R
