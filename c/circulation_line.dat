40|$|An {{accelerated}} oxidation process to decompose organic materials using ozone gas (ozonation process) {{has been developed}} as an alternative treatment, with limited secondary waste generation, of hot laundry wastewater from nuclear power plants. In this ozonation system, high concentration ozone gas is mixed in the wastewater using an ejector and static mixer in the <b>circulation</b> <b>line</b> connected to the wastewater collection tank. After the concentration of organic compounds decreases below the required value (one tenth of the initial concentration), residual solid materials are separated by the normal filtration process. A pilot plant test, with a maximum capacity of 300 liters per batch, was performed using simulated laundry wastewater. The decomposition rate of organic compounds by the ozonation process depended mainly on the ozone supply rate and the wastewater temperature. The concentration of total organic carbon could be reduced below the required value with only the ozone injection. Since most of the organic solid materials could be decomposed by ozone too, the specific resistance of wastewater, when passed through a membrane filter, decreased about two orders of magnitude with the ozonation process. The only secondary radioactive waste generated from this ozonation process would be filter sludge, so the amount of radioactive waste would be reduced substantially...|$|E
40|$|During the {{manufacturing}} of crystalline silicon solar cells, several {{wet chemical etching}} and cleaning steps {{play an important role}} for the resulting solar cell efficiency. One important step especially for monocrystalline silicon is texturing by anisotropic alkaline etching which takes place in an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide and isopropanol at a temperature between 70 and 80 degrees C. The evaporation of isopropanol and water, the consumption of potassium hydroxide and the accumulation of alkaline silicates change constantly the composition of the process bath. A replenishment of the converted chemicals is necessary to keep the texturisation results at a constant high level. To this clay, closing parameters are often based on operator's experience, but not on analytical data. In this paper, we investigated the suitability of near-infrared spectroscopy as a fast and cost-efficient method for the analysis of alkaline texturisation solutions.

The primary concern is the design of exterior spaces {{with the assumption that}} the poor urban spaces found in Malaysian urban areas is due to the weaknesses in the design method adopted by designers. For this purpose, the research addressed these objectives:- (1) To identify the reasons why the design of urban spaces is neglected by architects that produce poor continuity in the design of urban spaces, (2) To examine the process adopted and the infonnation used by architects in the design of urban ensemble and (3) To investigate {{the ways in which the}} architects responded to the needs of the user and the public. The techniques used for data collection include literature review, discussions with experts, content analysis, author's experience in practice, recognisance, observation, survey and in-depth interview. The information gathered was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. The weaknesses of the design process and limited use of important information were due to: (1) poor recognition of urban design, (2) limited time allocated, (3) economic pressure, (4) quick commissioning of the project and (5) professionalism. There was also insufficient public involvement in the design process due to poor public awareness, client's attitude, financial constraints, professionalism and the attitudes of the designer.

In deep tunnel engineering, the heat-harm {{becomes one of}} the main barriers. Investigations on high temperature coal mine have been done in Northern China, with the constructing of three models of high temperature mines suffering heat-harm, at the Jiahe mine, Sanhejian mine and Zhangshuanglou mine. The domestic and abroad cooling technologies of the mine respectively are also summarized after comparatively analyzing {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each technology. Finally, we find that the high temperature exchange machinery system (HEMS) technology that use mine discharge as the cold source, is excellent to heat-harm control in deep mines. Taking the Jiahe coal mine as an example, we systematically introduce this technology by disposing three main workstations. HEMS technology with its operations and functions in different exploitation levels are accomplished, including the extraction of refrigerating output, the transportation of chilled water by closed <b>circulation</b> <b>line,</b> the decompression of circulation lines and equipment by pressure transformation machine, and the heat exchange and cooling of workplace by heat exchange between wind stream and the chilled water.

Results of this project illustrate that it is efficient in heat-harm control with the temperature decrease of the workplace down to 26 – 29  °C, and being 4 – 6  °C lower than the original, and the relative humidity 5  %– 15  % lower than before. It greatly improves the working environment of underground workplace suffering heat-harm of high temperature and high humidity. In addition, by the extracting of deep geothermal energy, ground fired boiler for heating has been replaced, reducing environmental pollution.

North of 54 °N, as well as close to Newfoundland, deviations from the seasonal cycle indicate upper ocean warming from 1994 to 1998, with largest anomalous warming during late 1995 /early 1996 and during the winter 1997 / 1998. North of 54 °N, surface salinity increases after mid- 1996. The winter of 1995 / 1996 is the first winter of weak westerlies after more than 20 years of strong westerly conditions in the subarctic gyre, and the ocean loses less heat during that winter than during a normal year. The magnitude of upper ocean heat content change is {{at least twice as}} large as what results from the change in air-sea fluxes, which indicates a complementary contribution to heat content change by advection. Altimetric sea level data indicate also an increase of sea level of the order of 6. 5 cm during that year, out of which more than 4 cm is contributed by the steric change associated with the temperature increase.

In the 1540's then king Henry VIII began a campaign of excessive overspending of government money on his lavish lifestyle and to pay for wars with France and Scotland. In order to fund these Henry had already raised great sums through the Dissolution of the Monasteries, selling off the crowns land and by raising taxes however more money was still required. In May 1542 Henry VIII issued a secret indenture whereby he ordered that the amount of gold and silver within the country's coinage be secretly reduced and for the previous unsuccessful Testoon coin be reproduced. For the next two years the newly minted debased coins including the reintroduced Testoon were stockpiled in Jewel Tower in the Palace of Westminster while production of coins at the current standard continued. By May 1544 a lack of bullion arriving at the mint prompted the government to issue the secret indenture and allow the debased coins to enter into general circulation. Two months later in July 1544 merchants of the Low Countries discovered that newly minted silver groats had become debased and begun offering a lower price for them. The introduction of these debased coins caused coins at similar face value but with higher precious metal content to disappear from <b>circulation</b> in <b>line</b> with Gresham's law.|$|R

The present work quantifies the complex mixing of water masses in the SAO using a constrained, least-squares regression, Optimum MultiParameter (OMP) analysis. The OMP based on temperature, salinity, silicate and the conservative parameter NO, was applied on two World Ocean <b>Circulation</b> (WOCE) <b>lines,</b> A 17 and A 14, in the western and eastern SAO, respectively. The constrained OMP sensitivity to sources of error in the end-member characteristics, measured parameters, equation weights and oxygen to nitrogen mineralization ratio (RN) was carefully assessed using perturbation tests. Perturbation of RN was the only test that changed significantly the mixing proportions although by less than 5 %. The constrained OMP method allowed defining the realm and identifying the core-of-flow of each water mass to study its circulation, the evolution of its chemical composition and, eventually, to separate the contribution of physical and biogeochemical processes.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) {{is one of the}} most important processes in the petroleum refining industry for the conversion of heavy gasoil to gasoline and diesel. Furthermore, valuable gases such as ethylene, propylene and isobutylene are produced. The performance of the FCC units plays a major role on the overall economics of refinery plants. Any improvement in operation or control of FCC units will result in dramatic economic benefits. Present studies are concerned with the general behaviour of the industrial FCC plant, and have dealt with the modelling of the FCC units, which are very useful in elucidating the main characteristics of these systems for better design, operation, and control. Traditional control theory is no longer suitable for the increasingly sophisticated operating conditions and product specifications of the FCC unit. Due to the large economic benefits, these trends make the process control more challenging. There is now strong demand for advanced control strategies with higher quality to meet the challenges imposed by the growing technological and market competition. According to these highlights, the thesis objectives were to develop a new mathematical model for the FCC process, which was used to study the dynamic behaviour of the process and to demonstrate the benefits of the advanced control (particularly Model Predictive Control based on the nonlinear process model) for the FCC unit. The model describes the seven main sections of the entire FCC unit: (1) the feed and preheating system, (2) reactor, (3) regenerator, (4) air blower, (5) wet gas compressor, (6) catalyst <b>circulation</b> <b>lines</b> and (7) main fractionators. The novelty of the developed model consists in that besides the complex dynamics of the reactorregenerator system, it includes the dynamic model of the fractionator, as well as a new five lump kinetic model for the riser, which incorporates the temperature effect on the reaction kinetics; hence, it is able to predict the final production rate of the main products (gasoline and diesel), and can be used to analyze the effect of changing process conditions on the product distribution. The FCC unit model has been developed incorporating the temperature effect on reactor kinetics reference construction and operation data from an industrial unit. The resulting global model of the FCC unit is described by a complex system of partial-differential-equations, which was solved by discretising the kinetic models in the riser and regenerator on a fixed grid along the height of the units, using finite differences. The resulting model is a high order DAE, with 942 ODEs (142 from material and energy balances and 800 resulting from the discretisation of the kinetic models). The model offers the possibility of investigating the way that advanced control strategies can be implemented, while also ensuring that the operation of the unit is environmentally safe. All the investigated disturbances showed considerable influence on the products composition. Taking into account the very high volume production of an industrial FCC unit, these disturbances can have a significant economic impact. The fresh feed coke formation factor {{is one of the most}} important disturbances analysed. It shows significant effect on the process variables. The objective regarding the control of the unit has to consider not only to improve productivity by increasing the reaction temperature, but also to assure that the operation of the unit is environmentally safe, by keeping the concentration of CO in the stack gas below a certain limit. The model was used to investigate different control input-output pairing using classical controllability analysis based on relative gain array (RGA). Several multi-loop control schemes were first investigated by implementing advanced PID control using anti-windup. A tuning approach for the simultaneous tuning of multiple interacting PID controllers was proposed using a genetic algorithm based nonlinear optimisation approach. Linear model predictive control (LMPC) was investigated as a potential multi-variate control scheme applicable for the FCCU, using classical square as well as novel non-square control structures. The analysis of the LMPC control performance highlighted that although the multivariate nature of the MPC approach using manipulated and controlled outputs which satisfy controllability criteria based on RGA analysis can enhance the control performance, by decreasing the coupling between the individual low level control loops operated by the higher level MPC. However the limitations of using the linear model in the MPC scheme were also highlighted and hence a nonlinear model based predictive control scheme was developed and evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Fluid {{catalytic}} cracking (FCC) {{is one of}} the most important processes in the petroleum refining industry for the conversion of heavy gasoil to gasoline and diesel. Furthermore, valuable gases such as ethylene, propylene and isobutylene are produced. The performance of the FCC units plays a major role on the overall economics of refinery plants. Any improvement in operation or control of FCC units will result in dramatic economic benefits. Present studies are concerned with the general behaviour of the industrial FCC plant, and have dealt with the modelling of the FCC units, which are very useful in elucidating the main characteristics of these systems for better design, operation, and control. Traditional control theory is no longer suitable for the increasingly sophisticated operating conditions and product specifications of the FCC unit. Due to the large economic benefits, these trends make the process control more challenging. There is now strong demand for advanced control strategies with higher quality to meet the challenges imposed by the growing technological and market competition. According to these highlights, the thesis objectives were to develop a new mathematical model for the FCC process, which was used to study the dynamic behaviour of the process and to demonstrate the benefits of the advanced control (particularly Model Predictive Control based on the nonlinear process model) for the FCC unit. The model describes the seven main sections of the entire FCC unit: (1) the feed and preheating system, (2) reactor, (3) regenerator, (4) air blower, (5) wet gas compressor, (6) catalyst <b>circulation</b> <b>lines</b> and (7) main fractionators. The novelty of the developed model consists in that besides the complex dynamics of the reactorregenerator system, it includes the dynamic model of the fractionator, as well as a new five lump kinetic model for the riser, which incorporates the temperature effect on the reaction kinetics; hence, it is able to predict the final production rate of the main products (gasoline and diesel), and can be used to analyze the effect of changing process conditions on the product distribution.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study of the pattern of a space {{morphology}} in Chinatown area is to find a figural quality and a context of the space shape as one of the historical areas in Semarang. This study uses a rationalistic approach by a qualitative paradigm in relation to {{the purpose of this study}} that is to examine the pattern of a space morphology, formed by physical an non-physical aspects, in Chinatown Semarang. In order to find the pattern of the space morphology in a city settlement, the first step is understanding the area as a place which is formed as a public space. The concept of the area was done by observing three structural component i. e. morphology, typology, and topology. Therefore, to study the pattern of the space morphology the writer examined those component in accordance with the purpose and the background theories. The main component is a physical aspect which consists of the physical space pattern and this was done by examining the building configuration, the figure-ground, the circulation and the place, the space hierarchy, the inter-space connection, and the building typology. Whereas the supporting component is a nonphysical aspect which consists of the typology in the area and this was done by examining the social order, the spatial organization, and the pattern of the nonphysical space. According to the results and the analysis, the writer found that the pattern of the space morphology in the Chinatown develops from the physical aspect as the main component and the non-physical component as the supporting component. This was done by observing the history of the Chinatown area in Semarang. The pattern of the physical space in the Chinatown is a grid pattern formed by the building configuration and the connection of the <b>circulation</b> <b>lines.</b> This area is arranged by building a row of houses / stall-houses / houses for business with a Chinese temple (klenteng) as the center of the socio-culture activities and the market as the center of the economic activities. Each of the inter-space connections is close although it can be overlaps when the community hold a celebration. The pattern of the space morphology is also formed by the community live in the area. The communityorder affecting the form of the space morphology consists of the family, the religion, and the education systems which affect the people's activities in their daily life. Thus, the writer needs to study the existence of the space pattern as well as the culture so that it can be used in consideration of the city renovation. However, the community has to maintain the internal element in this area although it will develop into a re-renovation phase. In addition, there should be further studies of the Chinatown area in Semarang concerning the improvement planning and the settlement development in adopting the socio-culture potensial in order that the people are able to conserve the culture in this Chinatown area.

40|$|The Southern Ocean, where various water masses {{are formed}} (mode, intermediate, deep, and bottom waters), {{has a high}} {{potential}} to absorb anthropogenic CO 2 (Cant). However, most data-based and model estimates indicate low Cant inventories south of 50 °S. In order to investigate this paradox, the distribution of Cant is estimated between South Africa and Antarctica (World Ocean <b>Circulation</b> Experiment (WOCE) <b>line</b> I 6) based on a back-calculation technique previously used in the North Atlantic (Körtzinger et al., 1998) and adapted here for application in the Southern Ocean. At midlatitudes (30 °- 50 °S), formation and spreading of mode and intermediate waters results in a deep penetration of Cant (down to 2000 m). South of 50 °S, significant concentrations of Cant were estimated in Circumpolar Deep Water (> 10 μmol/kg) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) (20 - 25 μmol/kg). Higher concentrations are detected along the continental slope in AABW presumably formed in Prydz Bay compared to AABW of Weddell Sea origin. The distribution of Cant obtained north of 50 °S compares well with previous data-based and model estimates, but large disagreements {{are found in the}} south. However, although transient tracers are not used in the back-calculation technique employed here, the distribution of Cant is remarkably well correlated with CFCs. We reevaluated the column inventories of Cant for the Southern Ocean and found higher values at high latitudes (70 - 90 mol/m 2) compared to the subtropical/subantarctic region (40 - 80 mol/m 2). These results support the idea that deep and bottom water formation in the Southern Ocean is a key process in the natural sequestration of anthropogenic CO 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{baroclinic}} {{transport of}} the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) above 3000 m through Drake Passage is 107. 3 ± 10. 4 Sv {{and has been}} steady between 1975 and 2000. For six hydrographic sections (1993 – 2000) along the World Ocean <b>Circulation</b> Experiment (WOCE) <b>line</b> SR 1 b, the baroclinic transport relative to the deepest common level is 136. 7 ± 7. 8 Sv. The ACC transport is carried in two jets, the Subantarctic Front 53 ± 10 Sv and the Polar Front (PF) 57. 5 ± 5. 7 Sv. Southward of the ACC the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current transports 9. 3 ± 2. 4 Sv. We observe the PF at two latitudes separated by 90 km. This bimodal distribution is related {{to changes in the}} circulation and properties of Antarctic Bottom Water. Three realizations of the instantaneous velocity field were obtained with lowered ADCPs. From these observations we obtain near-bottom reference velocities for transport calculations. Net transport due to these reference velocities ranges from - 28 to 43 Sv, consistent with previous estimates of variability. The transport in density layers shows systematic variations due to seasonal heating in near-surface layers. Volume transport-weighted mean temperatures vary by 0. 40 °C from spring to summer; a seasonal variation in heat flux of about 0. 22 PW. Finally, we review a series of papers from the International Southern Ocean Studies Program. The average yearlong absolute transport is 134 Sv, and the standard deviation of the average is 11. 2 Sv; the error of the average transport is 15 to 27 Sv. We emphasize that baroclinic variability is an important contribution to net variability in the ACC...|$|R
