In OutRun mode, the player drives through five of fifteen stages, selecting them en route. The <b>Continuous</b> <b>mode</b> {{is similar to}} OutRun mode, but instead the player must drive through all fifteen stages. As in previous games in the series, {{there is a time}} limit that is extended upon passing checkpoints. Time Attack mode has the player race a ghost car over a pre-selected set of stages while timed. Time checks are presented to the player at various points on each stage.|$|E

2500|$|Nd:YAG lasers {{typically}} emit {{light with}} a wavelength of 1064 nm, in the infrared. However, {{there are also}} transitions near 946, 1120, 1320, and 1440nm. [...] Nd:YAG lasers operate in both pulsed and <b>continuous</b> <b>mode.</b> Pulsed Nd:YAG lasers are typically operated in the so-called Q-switching mode: An optical switch is inserted in the laser cavity waiting for a maximum population inversion in the neodymium ions before it opens. Then the light wave can run through the cavity, depopulating the excited laser medium at maximum population inversion. In this Q-switched mode, output powers of 250 megawatts and pulse durations of 10 to 25 nanoseconds have been achieved. The high-intensity pulses may be efficiently frequency doubled to generate laser light at 532nm, or higher harmonics at 355, 266 and 213nm.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with how free-stream vortical disturbances (FSVD) enter the boundary layer, a process which we refer to as entrainment. A self-consistent description of this physical process is presented, which shows that the non-parallel-flow effect plays a leading-order role even for disturbances with short wavelength comparable with the boundary-layer thickness or shorter. The entrained disturbances are thus drastically different from <b>continuous</b> <b>modes</b> of Orr-Sommerfeld/Squire equations, which neglect non-parallelism at outset. Indeed neglecting non-parallelism is found to cause several nonphysical features of <b>continuous</b> <b>modes,</b> including ‘Fourier entanglement’, abnormal anisotropy of FSVD, and for compressible boundary layers, entanglement of vortical and entropy <b>modes.</b> Eigenfunctions of <b>continuous</b> <b>modes</b> and their superpositions {{have been used to}} specify the inlet conditions in direct numerical simulations of bypass transition and boundary-layer receptivity. The findings of present study indicate that this popular practice is inappropriate, and a remedy is suggested...|$|R
