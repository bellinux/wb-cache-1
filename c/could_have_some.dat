5|$|In January 2011, the closely {{orbiting}} planet Kepler-10b {{was confirmed}} in {{the orbit of}} the star Kepler-10 after measurements of its transiting behavior (where it crosses in front of Kepler-10, periodically dimming it) and a radial velocity effect detected in Kepler-10's spectrum provided the information needed {{to prove that it}} was indeed a planet. An additional, longer-period dimming was detected in Kepler-10's spectrum, suggesting that a second planet existed in the system; however, there remained the possibility that this signal <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> other cause, and that the transit event was a false positive. Attempts to measure the radial velocity effects of this object, now named KOI 072.02, were fruitless; therefore, to rule out false positive scenarios, the Kepler team used a technique called Blender.|$|E
25|$|Bracken {{has been}} shown to be {{carcinogenic}} in some animals and some have suggested it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> part in causing the high incidence of stomach cancer in Japan. It is currently under investigation as a possible source of new insecticides.|$|E
25|$|Tuberculosis: Another {{possible}} explanation is that carriers of the gene <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> resistance to TB. This hypothesis is based on the thesis that CFTR gene mutation carriers have insufficient action in one of their enzymes – arylsulphatase - which is necessary for Mycobacterium tuberculosis virulence. As M. tuberculosis would use its host’s sources to affect the individual, and {{due to the lack of}} enzyme it could not presents its virulence, being a carrier of CFTR mutation could provide resistance against tuberculosis.|$|E

50|$|The Tibetan Bön religion, {{under the}} {{influence}} of Buddhism, also has its canon literature divided into two sections called the Kangyur and Tengyur but the number and contents of the collection are not yet fully known. Apparently, Bön began to take more on a literary form about the time Buddhism began to enter Tibet, although it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> written register some time before that.|$|R

25|$|The {{growth of}} cricket {{in the mid}} and late 19th century was {{assisted}} {{by the development of}} the railway network. For the first time, teams from a long distance apart could play one other without a prohibitively time-consuming journey. Spectators could travel longer distances to matches, increasing the size of crowds. Army units around the Empire had time on their hands, and encouraged the locals so they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> entertaining competition. Most of the Empire embraced cricket, with the exception of Canada.|$|E
25|$|The MCC {{went into}} the bush to Wagga Wagga to play a New South Wales Country XI. Ken Shuttleworth opened the bowling with a wicket maiden over, but was then taken off so that others <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> practice, Derek Underwood taking 2/15 and captain Colin Cowdrey 2/9 before they were all out for 117. Geoff Boycott (76) and Brian Luckhurst (62) {{polished}} their opening skills with another century stand which fell at 115, three runs short of victory. As before the MCC continued to bat after their victory and both openers were stumped off the bowling of Dasey. Cowdrey (37 not out) added 66 with Alan Knott (42) and the game ended when the wicket-keeper was dismissed by Wally Wellham, the uncle of the future Test batsmen Dirk Wellham.|$|E
25|$|This {{would also}} {{affect the way}} their {{offspring}} looked like in the early instars, resembling earlier ametabolous generations even after they had started {{to adapt to a}} new way of living, in a habitat where they actually <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> good use for flaps along their body. Since they matured {{in the same way as}} thysanurans with plenty of moultings as they were growing and very little difference between the adults and much younger individuals (unlike modern insects, which are hemimetabolous or holometabolous), there probably wasn't much room for adapting into different niches depending on age and stage. Also, it would have been difficult for an animal already adapted to a niche to make a switch to a new niche later in life based on age or size differences alone when these differences were not significant.|$|E

25|$|By using tape, I {{could do}} a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to the}} twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch fleet {{arrived in}} two groups: one of 24 ships in {{formation}} and another, far apart and about seven. Both were to windward of the Spanish, {{so they had}} the advantage of the wind. Escorting the convoy, a dozen ships including two stand by power and size, crescent-shaped {{to make way for the}} merchant, sufficiently armed for combat, but which should not be exposed for their precious cargo not be in cases of absolute necessity. But it seemed that those nine Spanish ships were to be a major obstacle to the Dutch. Fadrique could not expect much from its low power: the only good pataches will, expertise and valor of their commanders <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> value in combat, and six ships were medium galleons in all respects, little or more or equivalent to the twelve ships of the Dutch escort. The most important ship of the engagement was the Spanish flagship Santa Teresa, a vessel much larger and more powerful than all the present on both sides.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} portion of Toole's {{military}} career {{one of his}} primary motivations for advancement was to acquire a private office. Privacy was a significant luxury on the island {{with some of the}} men renting rooms in nearby hotels so they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> solitude. Toole's army buddy David Kubach, also an aspiring writer, lent him a green Swedish-made Halda typewriter for use in his office. The barracks consisted solely of college educated English professors, which gave it a different makeup from usual army companies. In contrast to almost all other army barracks where gays kept their sexual orientation a secret, there was an openly gay contingent which flaunted their homosexuality. The gay men reserved a portion of the barracks for themselves and as they did not proposition any of the straight instructors, they were left alone. However, this particular group of gay men drank significantly more {{than the rest of the}} group and eventually began to exhibit a loud, rowdy, and vulgar brand of behavior that made the straight men uncomfortable. Toole's response was to ignore their behavior and it lost him the respect of some of the men in the barracks. The problem came to a head when a gay instructor attempted suicide by overdosing on APC (aspirin, phenacetin, and caffeine) tablets after being spurned by another soldier. When Toole found the man he waited a half-hour to call for help, hoping he would awaken on his own. His friend Kubach stated that this was because it would look bad for the soldier and that he would most likely get himself court martialed for a suicide attempt. Some of his fellow soldiers were livid and held a meeting deciding whether to report Toole's negligence. Ultimately, they did not report his behavior and the army never filed any charges but his relationships with many of the men were irrevocably changed.|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} was predominantly negative. HorrorNews.net panned {{the film}} overall, criticizing it for its [...] "abundance of clichés" [...] and commenting that they'd [...] "be damned {{if there was}} anything in this picture worth seeing again".

500|$|In {{order to}} form the father-daughter bond needed for their {{respective}} roles, both Novakovic and Winton introduced each other to their families. The actors {{spent a lot of}} time together, to ensure they were comfortable together on and off screen. Natasha's father, Michael, is a widower and she is his only child. Bower revealed Natasha has her father wrapped around her finger. Michael dotes upon Natasha and Bower opined Natasha causes havoc because he is not strict with her. Winton said he thinks Michael is not handling things with Natasha [...] "too poorly", but she does make things difficult for him. During a 2011 interview with Channel 5, Winton said that Michael and Natasha's relationship had become tortured. Winton stated that Michael wishes Natasha would stop lying to him and hoped she would get her act together, so they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> semblance of a father/daughter relationship. Winton wanted Michael to build a better relationship with Natasha in the future as he loves her, despite the things she has done.|$|E
500|$|Wang had {{initially}} {{gone along with}} {{the writing on the}} show until {{towards the end of the}} second season when he asked the production writers if he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> action scenes and perhaps a romance. He had realised at the time that he was the only member of the main cast without a stunt double as he had never had an action scene that required one. This resulted in the Brannon Braga penned [...] "", to which Wang said to Rick Berman that there wasn't a need to give him all his requests in a single episode. Following that, he became more involved in suggestions for character direction, but the writers avoided giving Kim more of a comedic element similar to The Doctor (Robert Picardo) and Neelix (Ethan Phillips). Wang described himself as someone who tells jokes and makes impersonations on sets and was disappointed at not being able to utilise this nature. The producers at one point had planned to permanently kill off Harry Kim during season three, but after Wang was included in the People list of sexiest people alive 1997, the plan was abandoned.|$|E

2500|$|Cricket {{had become}} {{well-established}} among the English upper {{class in the}} 18th century, and was {{a major factor in}} sports competition among the public schools.

2500|$|Lechuza was {{released}} on May 22, 2001 and debuted on No.87 of the Billboard 200, with its single [...] "Threesome" [...] reaching No.66 on the UK Singles Chart. The album featured a total of eleven songs, {{all of which were}} more raucous and energetic than those on the band's previous efforts, with occasional escapes into heavy metal-esque guitar distortion paired with screaming vocal patterns. The reason for the change in style was Lewis' and DeLaPaz's constant feelings of disapproval for the band's songs, as revealed by Salazar in an interview in late 2002: [...] " [...] for Lechuza the guys were looking for a different direction so they wrote some songs that were way different, like Something Bad's Gonna Happen and Pasture of Muppets, just so that they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> songs that they could, in their words, actually have fun playing onstage." [...] One of these songs, [...] "Beating a Dead Horse", explicitly addresses the problems that had arisen within the band.|$|E
2500|$|Soon, {{the idea}} of zero-point energy {{attracted}} the attention of Albert Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern. In 1913 they published a paper that attempted to prove the existence of zero-point energy by calculating the specific heat of hydrogen gas and compared it with the experimental data. However, after assuming they had succeeded, they retracted support for the idea shortly after publication because they found Planck's second theory may not apply to their example. In a letter to Paul Ehrenfest of the same year Einstein declared zero-point energy “dead as a doornail” Zero-point energy was also invoked by Peter Debye, who noted that zero-point energy of the atoms of a crystal lattice would cause a reduction in the intensity of the diffracted radiation in X-ray diffraction even as the temperature approached absolute zero. In 1916 Walther Nernst proposed that empty space was filled with zero-point electromagnetic radiation. With the development of general relativity Einstein found the energy density of the vacuum to contribute towards a cosmological constant in order to obtain static solutions to his field equations; the idea that empty space, or the vacuum, <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> intrinsic energy associated to it had returned, with Einstein stating in 1920: ...|$|E
