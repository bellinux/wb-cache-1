25|$|Stereo {{recorders}} eventually {{evolved into}} high fidelity and {{were known as}} cassette decks, after the reel-to-reel decks. Hi-Fi cassette decks, in contrast to cassette recorders and <b>cassette</b> <b>players,</b> often didn't have built-in amplification or speakers. Many formats of <b>cassette</b> <b>players</b> and recorders have evolved over the years. Initially all were top loading, usually with cassette on one side, and VU meters and recording level controls on the other side. Older models used combinations of levers and sliding buttons for control.|$|E
25|$|Applications for car stereos varied widely. Auto {{manufacturers}} in the U.S. typically would fit a cassette slot into their standard large radio faceplates. Europe and Asia would standardize on DIN and double DIN sized faceplates. In the 1980s, a high-end installation {{would have a}} Dolby AM/FM cassette deck, and they rendered the 8-track cartridge obsolete in car installations because of space, performance, and audio quality. In the 1990s and 2000s, {{as the cost of}} building CD players declined, many manufacturers offered a CD player. The CD player eventually supplanted the cassette deck as standard equipment, but some cars, especially those targeted at older drivers, were offered with the option of a cassette player, either by itself or sometimes in combination with a CD slot. Most new cars can still accommodate aftermarket <b>cassette</b> <b>players,</b> and the auxiliary jack advertised for MP3 players can be used also with portable <b>cassette</b> <b>players,</b> but 2011 was the first model year for which no manufacturer offered factory-installed <b>cassette</b> <b>players.</b>|$|E
25|$|Using {{the damage}} to {{adjacent}} container AVN7511 to guide them, the investigators concluded that the explosion had occurred about 13inches (330mm) {{from the floor of}} AVE4041 and about 25inches (640mm) from the skin of the fuselage. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) investigators then conducted a series of tests in the United States, at which Alan Feraday of Britain's Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) is understood to have been present. The tests involved using metal containers loaded with luggage, and detonating plastic explosive within Toshiba radio <b>cassette</b> <b>players</b> in garment-filled suitcases, so as to replicate the sooting and pitting pattern of AVE4041. The tests were said to have proved AAIB investigators' theory concerning both the position of the bomb and the quantity of explosive involved.|$|E

500|$|Parlophone's {{advertising}} campaign was unorthodox. The label took full-page advertisements in high-profile British newspapers and tube stations with lyrics for [...] "Fitter Happier" [...] pitched in large black letters against white backgrounds. The same lyrics, and artwork {{adapted from the}} album, were repurposed for shirt designs. Yorke said, [...] "We actively chose to pursue the 'Fitter Happier' thing" [...] to link what a critic called [...] "a coherent set of concerns" [...] between the album artwork and its promotional material. More unconventional merchandise included a floppy disk with Radiohead screensavers and an FM radio {{in the shape of}} a desktop computer. In America, Capitol sent 1,000 <b>cassette</b> <b>players</b> to prominent members of the press and music industry, each with a copy of the album permanently glued inside. When asked about the campaign after the album's release, Capitol president Gary Gersh said, [...] "Our job is just to take them as a left-of-center band and bring the center to them. That's our focus, and we won't let up until they're the biggest band in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{loudness}} war (or loudness race) {{refers to}} the trend of increasing audio levels in recorded music which many critics believe reduces sound quality and listener enjoyment. Increasing loudness was first reported {{as early as the}} 1940s, with respect to mastering practices for 7" [...] singles. The maximum peak level of analog recordings such as these is limited by varying specifications of electronic equipment along the chain from source to listener, including vinyl and Compact <b>Cassette</b> <b>players.</b> The issue garnered renewed attention starting in the 1990s with the introduction of digital signal processing capable of producing further loudness increases.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cassette}} {{was a great}} {{step forward}} in convenience from reel-to-reel audio tape recording, although, because {{of the limitations of}} the cassette's size and speed, it initially compared poorly in quality. Unlike the 4-track stereo open-reel format, the two stereo tracks of each side lie adjacent to each other, rather than being interleaved with the tracks of the other side. This permitted monaural <b>cassette</b> <b>players</b> to play stereo recordings [...] "summed" [...] as mono tracks and permitted stereo players to play mono recordings through both speakers. The tape is [...] wide, with each stereo track 0.6mm wide and an unrecorded guard band between each track. The tape moves at [...] (1⅞ inch/s) from left to right. For comparison, the typical open-reel format in consumer use was [...] (¼ inch) wide, each stereo track nominally 1.0mm (1⁄25 inch) wide, and running at either twice or four times the speed of a cassette.|$|E
50|$|In 1984 the {{original}} Bose Wave system, called the Acoustic Wave Music System (AW-1), was Bose's first-ever tabletop radio. It uses two 2 inch tweeters, and a four inch woofer (which {{is the only}} speaker utilizing the Wave Guide), a <b>cassette</b> <b>player,</b> and an AM/FM radio into a mid-sized tabletop stereo system. In 1992 that Bose replaced the <b>cassette</b> <b>player</b> with a CD player (the CD2000), but Bose continued to sell a <b>cassette</b> <b>player</b> version (the CS2010) {{as an alternative to}} the CD version until the Acoustic Wave Music System v3 (CD3000) replaced both of them in 1996.|$|R

2500|$|Using {{headphones}} at {{a sufficiently}} high volume level may cause temporary or permanent hearing impairment or deafness. The headphone volume often has {{to compete with}} the background noise, especially in loud places such as subway stations, aircraft, and large crowds. Extended periods of exposure to high sound pressure levels created by headphones at high volume settings may be damaging; however, one hearing expert found that [...] "fewer than 5% of users select volume levels and listen frequently enough to risk hearing loss." [...] Some manufacturers of portable music devices have attempted to introduce safety circuitry that limited output volume or warned the user when dangerous volume was being used, but the concept has been rejected by most of the buying public, which favors the personal choice of high volume. Koss introduced the [...] "Safelite" [...] line of <b>cassette</b> <b>players</b> in 1983 with such a warning light. The line was discontinued two years later for lack of interest.|$|E

5000|$|A {{key element}} of the cassette's success was its use in in-car {{entertainment}} systems, where {{the small size of}} the tape was significantly more convenient than the competing 8-track cartridge system. <b>Cassette</b> <b>players</b> in cars and for home use were often integrated with a radio receiver, and the term [...] "casseiver" [...] was occasionally used for combination units for home use. In-car <b>cassette</b> <b>players</b> were the first to adopt automatic reverse ("auto-reverse") of the tape direction at each end, allowing a cassette to be played endlessly without manual intervention. Home cassette decks soon added the feature. In Car <b>cassette</b> <b>players</b> are preferred by some particularly for their cheaper cost and serviceability.|$|E
