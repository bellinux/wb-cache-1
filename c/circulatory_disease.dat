METHODS: All Black deaths from <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases</b> (International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision. codes 390 through 459) were extracted from the National Center for Health Statistics mortality detail files for 1979 through 1991. Age-specific and age-adjusted mortality rates with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated {{for males and females}} for combinations of five regions of residence at birth and four regions of residence at death. RESULTS: Males had higher mortality rates from <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases</b> than females in every regional combination of birthplace and residence at death. For both genders, the highest rates were for those who were born in the South but died in the Midwest; the lowest rates were for those who were born in the West but died in the South.

40|$|Varicose {{veins and}} {{haemorrhoids}} both involve the venous circulatory system, {{but it is}} unclear whether they are predictors of elevated rates of other <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases.</b> Our aim was to determine whether they are. We analysed an epidemiological database of hospital admission and day-case statistics, constructing cohorts of people admitted for care for varicose veins or haemorrhoids, and comparing their experience of subsequent <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases</b> with a control cohort. Compared with the control cohort, there was an elevated risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the varicose veins cohort (rate ratio 1. 20; 95 % confidence interval 1. 08 - 1. 33) but not in the haemorrhoids cohort (0. 90; 0. 78 - 1. 03). No other <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases</b> showed significantly elevated risks associated with varicose veins or haemorrhoids. The rate ratio for coronary heart disease in the varicose veins cohort was 0. 91 (95 % confidence interval 0. 88 - 0. 95) and that in the haemorrhoids cohort was 0. 98 (0. 94 - 1. 03). We conclude that neither varicose veins nor haemorrhoids showed strong association, either positive or negative, with other <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases.</b> There was a significant, but numerically modest, elevated risk of DVT associated with varicose veins.

40|$|AIMS: Mortality {{statistics}} have customarily been coded and analysed {{using only}} one underlying cause of death. Rules for selecting the underlying cause, {{when more than}} one cause is certified on a death certificate, have changed twice in England over the past 20 years. We used data from death certificates for 1979 - 99 to compare mortality rates for diabetes mellitus certified anywhere on death certificates with those certified as the underlying cause. METHODS: Analysis of data from 18, 917 death certificates that included diabetes mellitus in the former Oxford health region. RESULTS: Based on the underlying cause of death, mortality rates for diabetes varied substantially between the periods defined by rule changes. Based on mentions of diabetes anywhere on the death record, mortality rates were almost unchanged over time: they showed a non-significant rise of 0. 1 % per year (95 % confidence interval - 0. 3, 0. 6). <b>Circulatory</b> <b>diseases</b> were certified causes of death in 71 % of all deaths in people with diabetes. Although mortality rates from <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases</b> {{in the general population}} fell by 2. 5 % per year, rates for <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases</b> in combination with diabetes did not fall. CONCLUSIONS: Two explanations are possible for the lack of change in mortality rates for diabetes based on all certified mentions between 1979 and 1999. Increasing prevalence and improved survival may have resulted in no net change; and/or there may have been no improvement in survival for people whose diabetes is associated with life-threatening pathology and in particular with <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{study by}} Melberg et al (2013) on {{hospital}} expenditure in Norway in 2010 {{finds that the}} average costs of decedents decreased by 24 % and 33 % {{for males and females}} respectively between the ages of 70 and 80. Similar results are observed in other European countries and in the United States. The forces behind this inverse relation are not well understood. Objective: To determine whether the decline in resource use on decedents with age is due to disease prevalence across age groups, i. e. case mix, the treatment intensity across age groups or a combination of factors. Method: The study will employ both descriptive graphical presentation and regression analysis to determine the effect of type of disease and treatment intensity on resource use with age. Data is collected from the Norwegian Patient Registry. Results: Initial findings indicate that the most common disease group amongst decedents is <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases.</b> This is also the relatively cheapest disease group in terms of both average cost and number of days spent in hospital per patient independent of age. The AC declines for every yearly increase in age by NOK 2080, NOK 1693 and NOK 1017 for neoplasms, respiratory and <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases</b> respectively. The inverse relation between resources consumed and age is less pronounced amongst <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases.</b> Similar results are present for the average number of days as well, although the decline in number of days for <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases</b> is not significant with age in the regression results. The average number of days decline for every yearly increase in age by 0. 3 and 0. 25 days for neoplasms and respiratory diseases respectively, while it increases for every yearly increase in age by 0. 007 days for <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases.</b> Conclusion: Even though circulatory is the most common and the cheapest disease of the three disease types investigated in this study, the disease prevalence does not entirely explain the decline in average costs since there is a significant decline in average costs for all diseases. This finding suggests a decline in aggressiveness of care received in the oldest age groups. In addition, observing the relationship between age and resource use by number of days in hospital as well as expenditure indicates that the consumption of resources in hospitals differs depending on how the resources are measured and on type of disease. The relation between days and age implies a more conservative decline in resources used and for <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases</b> the relationship is insignifican...|$|R

The WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3. 0 was used to diagnose major depression according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and additional interviews assessed the presence of <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases.</b> Using data from a random subsample of the respondents (n= 832), we conducted Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios for the onset of major depression with comorbid <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases</b> as a time-dependent covariate.

Heart disease (HR, 2. 12 [95 % CI, 0. 79 - 5. 70]), diabetes (HR, 2. 36 [95 % CI, 0. 42 - 13. 34]) and hypertension (HR, 0. 97 [95 % CI, 0. 37, 2. 50]) were not significantly associated.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{test for}} a {{significant}} association between air pollution and emergency hospital admissions for <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases</b> (international classification of diseases- 9 390 - 459) in London, England, that {{would be consistent with}} a causal effect of pollution on the previous day. METHODS: Long term concurrent trends, temperature, humidity, day of the week, influenza epidemic of 1989, and cyclical covariations with periodicity > 20 days in daily measures of pollution and admissions for 1987 - 94 were allowed for. RESULTS: There were 373556 admissions. No association was found between O 3 and <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases.</b> Four other pollutants were associated with acute myocardial infarction and <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases</b> combined. P values and attributable cases (95 % confidence intervals) for acute myocardial infarction were: black smoke P = 0. 003, 2. 5 % (0. 8 % to 4. 3 %); NO 2 P = 0. 002, 2. 7 % (0. 8 % to 4. 6 %); CO P = 0. 001, 2. 1 % (0. 7 % to 3. 5 %); and SO 2 P = 0. 0006, 1. 7 % (0. 7 % to 2. 6 %). There were also associations between black smoke and angina (P = 0. 02), NO 2 and arrhythmia (P = 0. 04), and CO and other <b>circulatory</b> <b>diseases</b> (P = 0. 004), but none with heart failure. Acute myocardial infarction was the only diagnosis for which there were significant associations with and without adjustment for cyclical terms.
