5|$|The {{wings are}} {{transparent}} with black or brown veins and a brown-black patch {{at the base}} of apical cells 2 and 3. These patches are sometimes fused into a continuous zigzag of dark brown to black discolouration. The basal cell is often opaque and amber-coloured. As on many insects, the wing membranes are <b>coated</b> <b>on</b> either side by a repeating pattern of cuticular nanostructures, about 200nm in height, separated by about 180nm. These are thought to aid in anti-reflective camouflage, anti-wetting and self-cleaning.|$|E

25|$|Current color films do {{this with}} three layers of {{differently}} color-sensitive photographic emulsion <b>coated</b> <b>on</b> one strip of film base.

25|$|Photographic plates, {{which had}} the {{light-sensitive}} emulsion <b>coated</b> <b>on</b> a thin sheet of glass, were normally used instead of flexible film, both because a general transition from glass plates to plastic film was still in progress and because glass provided the best dimensional stability for three images intended to match up perfectly when they were later combined.|$|E

25|$|A silver {{glass mirror}} is an {{ordinary}} mirror, <b>coated</b> <b>on</b> its back surface with silver, which produces images by reflection. This kind of glass mirror {{is produced by}} coating a silver, copper film and two or more layers of waterproof paint on the back surface of float glass, which perfectly resists acid and moisture. A silver glass mirror provides clear and actual images, is quite durable, and is widely used for furniture, bathroom and other decorative purposes.|$|E
25|$|Single sided disks were <b>coated</b> <b>on</b> both sides, {{despite the}} {{availability}} of more expensive double sided disks. The reason usually given for the higher cost was that double sided disks were certified error-free {{on both sides of}} the media. Double-sided disks could be used in some drives for single-sided disks, as long as an index signal was not needed. This was done one side at a time, by turning them over (flippy disks); more expensive dual-head drives which could read both sides without turning over were later produced, and eventually became used universally.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{chemicals}} <b>coated</b> <b>on</b> the nests are {{equivalent to that}} present in adult P. dominula bodies, young wasps learn this chemical template {{in the very early}} state of the adult life to later on be able to distinguish their nest mates from non-nest mates. The CHC composition of the larvae and adults are very different, in that the larvae's relative abundance of low-molecular-weight CHCs is higher and that the larval profiles are more uniform than those of adults. Adults are also able to distinguish odors of their own colonial larval CHCs from those of foreign colonys.|$|E

25|$|This is the {{standard}} process used by National Mapping Agencies. It uses a plastic film, which is <b>coated</b> <b>on</b> one side with a photo-opaque film. The layer is removed with a scribing tool or scalpel to produce a negative image. One sheet of film is needed for each solid colour, and one for each screen, usually requiring about ten sheets of film altogether. The map is drawn at final map scale, and the negatives are printed with high quality dot screens to produce the five film positives for printing. The process {{makes it easy to}} produce high quality maps, but it does require a number of specialist tools.|$|E
25|$|Emerald is a {{rare and}} {{valuable}} gemstone and, as such, it has provided the incentive for developing synthetic emeralds. Both hydrothermal and flux-growth synthetics have been produced. The first commercially successful emerald synthesis process was that of Carroll Chatham. The other large producer of flux emeralds was Pierre Gilson Sr., which {{has been on the}} market since 1964. Gilson's emeralds are usually grown on natural colorless beryl seeds which become <b>coated</b> <b>on</b> both sides. Growth occurs at the rate of 1mm per month, a typical seven-month growth run producing emerald crystals of 7mm of thickness. The green color of emeralds is widely attributed to presence of Cr3+ ions. Intensely green beryls from Brazil, Zimbabwe and elsewhere in which the color is attributed to vanadium have also been sold and certified as emeralds.|$|E
25|$|A decade later, Davson and Danielli {{proposed}} a modification to this concept. In their model, the lipid bilayer was <b>coated</b> <b>on</b> either {{side with a}} layer of globular proteins. According to their view, this protein coat had no particular structure and was simply formed by adsorption from solution. Their theory was also incorrect in that it ascribed the barrier properties of the membrane to electrostatic repulsion from the protein layer rather than the energetic cost of crossing the hydrophobic core. A more direct investigation of the membrane was made possible through the use of electron microscopy in the late 1950s. After staining with heavy metal labels, Sjöstrand et al. noted two thin dark bands separated by a light region, which they incorrectly interpreted as a single molecular layer of protein. A more accurate interpretation was made by J. David Robertson, who determined that the dark electron-dense bands were the headgroups and associated proteins of two apposed lipid monolayers. In this body of work, Robertson put forward the concept of the “unit membrane.” This {{was the first time the}} bilayer structure had been universally assigned to all cell membranes as well as organelle membranes.|$|E

25|$|P. dominula {{females are}} able to {{distinguish}} between nestmates and non-nestmates. Triads of wasps show more discrimination and aggression toward non-nestmates than dyads of wasps. In triads, aggression is increased because a defense of the nest can be shared with other nestmates, but for an individual, {{the cost of the}} aggression is greater than the benefit of the defense. Insect body surface is coated with cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) for waterproofing. These chemicals also contribute to recognition among individuals, kin, and nest mates. The same cuticle that the adults have are <b>coated</b> <b>on</b> the nests, allowing the wasps to recognize their home. An analysis of the differences in CHC profiles between dominant and subordinate females found that while differences are not clear at the early stages of nest founding, these differences become prominent upon worker emergence. The CHC profiles of the dominant female exhibit a greater proportion of distinctive unsaturated alkenes of longer chain length compared to those of subordinates. When the queen is removed, the replacement queen's CHC profile becomes {{similar to that of the}} original queen. Upon analyzing whether CHC is a signal for fertility or dominance, researchers concluded that it is a signal for dominance because subordinates with developed ovaries still exhibited profiles that differed from those of dominants.|$|E

500|$|Capybaras {{have two}} types of scent glands; a morillo (...) , located on the snout, and anal glands. Both sexes have these glands, but males have much larger morillos and use their anal glands more frequently. The anal glands of males are also lined with {{detachable}} hairs. A crystalline form of scent secretion is <b>coated</b> <b>on</b> these hairs and is released when in contact with objects such as plants. These hairs have a longer-lasting scent mark and are tasted by other capybaras. Capybaras scent-mark by rubbing their morillos on objects, or by walking over scrub and marking it with their anal glands. Capybaras can spread their scent further by urinating; however, females usually mark without urinating and scent-mark less frequently than males overall. Females mark more often during the wet season {{when they are in}} estrus. In addition to objects, males also scent-mark females.|$|E
500|$|Breeding {{typically}} commences in mid-March in {{the south}} and west of Europe (late February in Britain), but not till early May in Finland.

The nest site may be up to [...] above the ground, although [...] is more typical. The common chaffinch often nests close to a mistle thrush, the vigilance of the finch and the aggressive behaviour of the thrush benefiting both species. The thrush's nest is a large cup of sticks, dry grass, roots and moss, <b>coated</b> <b>on</b> the inside with a layer of mud and lined with fine grass and leaves. The nest is built by the female, although the male may help. Nests built early in the breeding season may be destroyed by bad weather.|$|E
