40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{latitudinal}} aspect of chaotic behaviour of ionosphere during quiet and <b>storm</b> <b>periods</b> are analyzed and compared by using GPS TEC time series measured at equatorial trough, crest and outside crest stations over Indian subcontinent, by employing the chaotic quantifiers like Lyapunov exponent (LE), correlation dimension (CD), entropy and nonlinear prediction error (NPE). It is {{observed that the}} values of LE are low for <b>storm</b> <b>periods</b> compared to those of quiet periods for all the stations considered here. The lowest value of LE is observed at the trough station, Agatti (2. 38 ° N, Geomagnetically), and highest at crest station, Mumbai (10. 09 ° N, Geomagnetically) for both quiet and <b>storm</b> <b>periods.</b> The values of correlation dimension computed for TEC time series {{are in the range}} 2. 23 – 2. 74 for quiet period, which indicate that equatorial ionosphere may be described with three variables during quiet period. But the crest station Mumbai shows a higher value of CD (3. 373) during storm time, which asserts that four variables are necessary to describe the system during <b>storm</b> <b>period.</b> The values of non linear prediction error (NPE) are lower for Agatti (2. 38 ° N, Geomagnetically) and Jodhpur (18. 3 ° N, Geomagnetically), during <b>storm</b> <b>period,</b> compared to those of quiet period, mainly because of the predominance of non linear aspects during <b>storm</b> <b>periods</b> The surrogate data test is carried out and {{on the basis of the}} significance of difference of the original data and surrogates for various aspects, the surrogate data test rejects the null hypothesis that the time series of TEC during storm and quiet times represent a linear stochastic process. It is also observed that using state space model, detrended TEC can be predicted, which reasonably reproduces the observed data. Based on the values of the above quantifiers, the features of chaotic behaviour of equatorial trough crest and outside the crest regions of ionosphere during geomagnetically quiet and disturbed periods are briefly discussed...|$|R

Calculated fine sediment exchange processes at the seawater–seabed interface are driven by the instant values of the shear stress velocity due to currents and waves.

As {{a result of the}} action of currents and waves, local bathymetry and the fine sediment content at the sea bottom, modeled time series shows different short-term dynamics of SPM concentrations in various locations in the North Sea.

The variability in GEC is captured by the computation of DGEC which is obtained by taking the hourly ratio of instant GEC to median of GEC values at the same hour of 7 preceding days. The storm onset is determined by a joint analysis of variations in IMF-B magnitude, its derivative (dB/dt) and direction of IMF-Bz together with sudden increase in AE exceeding 900 nT. The start of the pre-storm period is chosen to be 7 h prior to the storm onset time and the <b>storm</b> recovery <b>period</b> ends 41 h after the storm onset. The hourly AEsn is related to DGEC during the <b>storm</b> <b>period</b> through a polynomial whose coefficients are estimated in the linear least squares sense. Estimated coefficients are examined and grouped with respect to different kinds of auroral storms. Examples of modeling methodology are provided using four different kinds of intense storms and substorms, namely, Positive Arctic, Positive Antarctic, Negative Arctic and Negative Antarctic that occurred between 1999 and 2013.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Low-level {{thermodynamic}} stability, {{an important}} consideration for winter season ground-based cloud seeding site selection and conduct of operations, varies con-siderably in and near mountainous terrain. Rawinsonde observations may sometimes be poorly representative of nearby areas, with significant lower-level atmospheric tempera-ture variability common between basins and sometimes within a basin. Operational fore-cast models may lack the ability to resolve or properly initialize low-level stability or “cold pooling ” specific to a given basin or portion of a basin. Analyses of surface observations, as well as plume dispersion modeling with HYSPLIT, can be used both for real-time op-erations and in post-hoc examinations of low-level stability specific to <b>storm</b> <b>periods</b> with cloud seeding potential. Analyses of this type have been performed in various portions of Utah, and a recent analysis in the Uinta Range and Uinta Basin area of northeastern Utah highlights both the geographic variability and the seasonality of basin cold pooling.

40|$|The {{deterministic}} chaotic {{behavior and}} dynamical {{complexity of the}} space plasma dynamical system over Nigeria are analyzed {{in this study and}} characterized. The study was carried out using GPS (Global Positioning System) TEC (Total Electron Content) time series, measured in the year 2011 at three GPS receiver stations within Nigeria, which lies within the equatorial ionization anomaly region. The TEC time series for the five quietest and five most disturbed days of each month of the year were selected for the study. The nonlinear aspect of the TEC time series was obtained by detrending the data. The detrended TEC time series were subjected to various analyses for phase space reconstruction and to obtain the values of chaotic quantifiers like Lyapunov exponents, correlation dimension and also Tsallis entropy for the measurement of dynamical complexity. The observations made show positive Lyapunov exponents (LE) for both quiet and disturbed days, which indicates chaoticity, and for different days the chaoticity of the ionosphere exhibits no definite pattern for either quiet or disturbed days. However, values of LE were lower for the <b>storm</b> <b>period</b> compared with its nearest relative quiet periods for all the stations. The monthly averages of LE and entropy also show no definite pattern for the month of the year. The values of the correlation dimension computed range from 2. 8 to 3. 5, with the lowest values recorded at the <b>storm</b> <b>period</b> of October 2011. The surrogate data test shows a significance of difference greater than 2 for all the quantifiers. The entropy values remain relatively close, with slight changes in these values during <b>storm</b> <b>periods.</b> The values of Tsallis entropy show similar variation patterns to those of Lyapunov exponents, with a lot of agreement in their comparison, with all computed values of Lyapunov exponents correlating with values of Tsallis entropy within the range of 0. 79 to 0. 81.

The ionospheric dissipation is investigated by determining the Joule heating and precipitation powers in the simulation during the two events. The ionospheric dissipation is concentrated largely on the dayside cusp region during the main phase of the <b>storm</b> <b>period,</b> whereas the nightside oval dominates the ionospheric dissipation during the substorm event.

40|$|While the {{correspondence}} of rainfall return period TP and flood return period TQ {{is at the}} heart of the design storm procedure, their relationship is still poorly understood. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the controls on this relationship. To better understand the interplay of the controlling factors we assume a simplified world with block rainfall, constant runoff coefficient and linear catchment response. We use an analytical derived flood frequency approach in which, following design practise, TP is defined as the return period of the intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curve given storm duration and depth. Results suggest that the main control on the mapping of rainfall to flood return periods is the ratio of storm duration and catchment response time, as would be expected. In the simple world assumed in this work, TQ is always smaller or equal than TP of the associated storm, i. e. TQ/TP&le; 1. This is because of the difference in the selectiveness of the rectangular filters used to construct the IDF curves and the unit hydrograph (UH) together with the fact that different rectangular filters are used when evaluating the <b>storm</b> return <b>periods.</b> The <b>critical</b> <b>storm</b> duration that maximises TQ/TP is, in descending importance, a function of the catchment response time and the distribution of storm duration, while the maximum value of TQ/TP is mainly a function of the coefficient of variation of storm duration.

The method is based on fluctuations of the total electron content (TEC) resulted from the ionospheric plasma irregularities. Previous studies have showed {{the correlation between the}} radiowave intensity (including GPS signals) and ionospheric irregularities during magnetic <b>storm</b> <b>periods.</b> In this study, phase fluctuations derived from GPS signals are used to address aspects of the ionospheric storm events during the low irregularity activity months.

It is found that, in general no significant feature in the phase fluctuation is observed during the low irregularity activity months, except during the 26 August 1998 and the 15 July 2000 storms. A detailed study shows that the GPS phase fluctuations develop when the Dst index begins to decrease significantly. This phenomenon cannot be compared directly to previous observations and model results due to the fundamental difference in the background levels of irregularity activity. To better understand the generation of ionospheric irregularities during the <b>storm</b> <b>period</b> of the low irregularity activity months, the temporal relationship between the magnetic Dst index, equatorial anomaly TEC, and the GPS phase fluctuations are examined and discussed.|$|R

40|$|For a {{detailed}} study of the space weather impact on the equatorial and low latitude F-region, the ionospheric response features are analysed during the periods of three recent and most severe magnetic storm events of the present solar cycle which occurred in October and November 2003, and November 2004. The F-layer base height (h'F), peak height (hmF 2) and critical frequency (foF 2) data, from Trivandrum, an equatorial station and Delhi, a low latitude location, are examined during the three magnetic <b>storm</b> <b>periods.</b> The results of the analysis clearly shows that {{the height of the}} F-region (both h'F and hmF 2), at the equator and low latitude, simultaneously increases by 200 to 300 km, in association with maximum negative excursion of Dst values around the midnight hours with a large depletion of ionization over the equator, which is followed by an ionization enhancement at low latitude during the recovery phase of the storm. At Delhi, fast variations up to 200 m/s are also observed in the F-layer vertical upward/downward velocity, calculated using Doppler shifts, associated with the maximum negative excursion of Dst. This shows that during magnetic disturbances, the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) expands to a much wider latitude than the normal fountain driven by the E/F-layer dynamo electric fields. It is also observed that during the main phase of the storm, at low latitude there is generally an enhancement of F-region ionization with an increase in h'F/hmF 2 but in the equatorial region, the ionization collapses with a decrease in h'F/hmF 2, especially after sunset hours. In addition, at the equator the normal pre-sunset hours' enhancement in h'F is considerably suppressed during <b>storm</b> <b>periods.</b> This might be due to changes in magnitude and direction of the zonal electric field affecting the upward E&times;B drift and hence the plasma distribution {{in the form of a}} decrease in electron density in the equatorial region and an increase in the low latitude region.

This implies that, for the cases considered here, geomagnetic storms {{may not be an}} additional source to increase or decrease the deterministic chaotic aspects of magnetosphere, especially during high solar activity. During solar minimum period (1994), the seasonal mean value of Lyapunov exponent for AE index time series belong to quiet periods in winter (0. 7 &plusmn; 0. 11 min&minus; 1 ) is higher compared to corresponding value of <b>storm</b> <b>periods</b> in winter (0. 36 &plusmn; 0. 09 min&minus; 1 ). This {{may be due to the}} fact that, stochastic part, which is Dst dependent could be more prominent during storms, thereby increasing fluctuations/stochasticity and reducing determinism in AE index time series during storms. It is observed that, during low solar active period (1994), the seasonal mean value of entropy for time series representing <b>storm</b> <b>periods</b> of equinox is greater than that for quiet periods. However, significant difference is not observed between storm and quiet time values of entropy during high solar activity (1991), which is also true for nonlinear prediction error for both low and high solar activities. In the case of both high and low solar activities, the higher standard deviations of yearly mean Lyapunov exponent values for AE index time series for <b>storm</b> <b>periods</b> compared to those for quiet periods might be due to the strong interplay between stochasticity and determinism during storms.
