25|$|This led in 1828 to an {{important}} theorem, the Theorema Egregium (remarkable theorem), establishing {{an important}} property {{of the notion of}} curvature. Informally, the theorem says that the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surface</b> can be determined entirely by measuring angles and distances on the surface.|$|E
25|$|Informally Gauss {{defined the}} <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surface</b> {{in terms of}} the curvatures of certain plane curves {{connected}} with the surface. He later found a series of equivalent definitions. One of the first was {{in terms of the}} area-expanding properties of the Gauss map, a map from the surface to a 2-dimensional sphere. However, before obtaining a more intrinsic definition in terms of the area and angles of small triangles, Gauss needed to make an in-depth investigation of the properties of geodesics on the surface, i.e. paths of shortest length between two fixed points on the surface (see below).|$|E

2500|$|Gauss's Theorema Egregium (Latin: [...] "remarkable theorem") {{states that}} Gaussian <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surface</b> can be {{determined}} from the measurements of length on the surface itself. In fact, {{it can be found}} given the full knowledge of the first fundamental form and expressed via the first fundamental form and its partial derivatives of first and second order. Equivalently, the determinant of the second fundamental form of a surface in R3 can be so expressed. The [...] "remarkable", and surprising, feature of this theorem is that although the definition of the Gaussian <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surface</b> S in R3 certainly depends on {{the way in which the}} surface is located in space, the end result, the Gaussian curvature itself, is determined by the intrinsic metric of the surface without any further reference to the ambient space: it is an intrinsic invariant. In particular, the Gaussian curvature is invariant under isometric deformations of the surface.|$|E

2500|$|Carl Friedrich Gauss {{may have}} been the first to {{consider}} abstract spaces as mathematical objects in their own right. [...] His theorema egregium gives a method for computing the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surface</b> without considering the ambient space in which the surface lies. [...] Such a surface would, in modern terminology, be called a manifold; and in modern terms, the theorem proved that the curvature of the surface is an intrinsic property. Manifold theory has come to focus exclusively on these intrinsic properties (or invariants), while largely ignoring the extrinsic properties of the ambient space.|$|E
2500|$|If the Gaussian <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surface</b> [...] is {{everywhere}} positive, then the Euler characteristic is positive so [...] is homeomorphic (and therefore diffeomorphic) to [...] If in addition {{the surface is}} isometrically embedded in , the Gauss map provides an explicit diffeomorphism. As Hadamard observed, {{in this case the}} surface is convex; this criterion for convexity {{can be viewed as a}} 2-dimensional generalisation of the well-known second derivative criterion for convexity of plane curves. Hilbert proved that every isometrically embedded closed surface must have a point of positive curvature. Thus a closed Riemannian 2-manifold of non-positive curvature can never be embedded isometrically in however, as Adriano Garsia showed using the Beltrami equation for quasiconformal mappings, this is always possible for some conformally equivalent metric.|$|E
