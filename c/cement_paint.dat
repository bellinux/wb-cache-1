Snowcem launched the Sandtex brand in 1969, which had strong sales in the European market. In 2002 - 3 the company was the largest manufacturer of <b>cement</b> <b>paint</b> in India, enjoying between 25 - 30 per cent of the national market share {{in this type of}} powder paint to which water is added, and had attracted the acquisitive attentions of Asian Paints and Berger Paints India. By 2008, however, the company had retained its independence and launched new products to augment its traditional reliance upon <b>cement</b> <b>paint,</b> including external acrylic emulsions and other liquid paints.|$|E

50|$|Rheology has {{applications}} in materials science engineering, geophysics, physiology, human biology and pharmaceutics. Materials science is utilized {{in the production}} of many industrially important substances, such as <b>cement,</b> <b>paint,</b> and chocolate, which have complex flow characteristics. In addition, plasticity theory has been similarly important for the design of metal forming processes. The science of rheology and the characterization of viscoelastic properties in the production and use of polymeric materials has been critical for the production of many products for use in both the industrial and military sectors.Study of flow properties of liquids is important for pharmacists working in the manufacture of several dosage forms, such as simple liquids, ointments, creams, pastes etc. The flow behavior of liquids under applied stress is of great relevance in the field of pharmacy. Flow properties are used as important quality control tools to maintain the superiority of the product and reduce batch to batch variations.|$|E

After formation in 1959, the products Impermo, Hardcrete, Cemprover, Cemix, Snowfilla and Snowsol were successfully introduced into the Indian market between 1963 and 1969. In the 1970s, Sandtex Matt, an exterior liquid coating in Europe, was launched and met with notable success. Two new products were launched in 1997 - premium quality Snowcryl XT, a pure acrylic base smooth exterior finish and Impermo, an integral cement waterproofing compound, in liquid form.|$|R
50|$|Structures, {{which are}} {{designed}} as integral arches, {{can be constructed}} as stiff individual objects or {{by means of a}} sprayed concrete procedure. Arches made of sprayed concrete provide for free and organic shapes, allowing rooms to become suffused with light. The sprayed concrete procedure was first used by natural scientist Carl Akeley in 1911. Akeley patented a device able to spray fine-grained concrete. While sprayed concrete is mainly applied in underground engineering and tunnel construction, Friedrich Kiesler was the first to use this technique for the construction of buildings. Swiss architect Peter Vetsch improved the technique over several years. To date, he has built over 40 earth houses using sprayed concrete, and he can therefore be considered the leading authority in this area of expertise. The sprayed concrete is applied to a finely meshed metal stretch net which is welded onto the supporting armature. The curvatures are bent and formed according to the intended shape of the building. A 20 cm thick polyurethane solid-foam-insulation is sprayed onto the outside of the arches, protecting the house from low or high temperatures. A fleece filter mat is then laid on top of this and the building is covered with a thick layer of soil some 80 cm to 3 metres thick. The foundation of the buildings designed by Peter Vetsch are built conventionally. The interior walls of an earth house are furnished using loam rendering which provides superior humidity compensation. The loam rendering is finally coated with lime-white <b>cement</b> <b>paint.</b>|$|E
30|$|To measure crack development, each {{specimen}} is brushed {{with white}} <b>cement</b> <b>paint,</b> and 100  ×  100  mm grid lines are drawn on it before testing. The actual stirrup position is marked on each specimen. The crack widths are measured using a microscope with a measurement resolution of 0.01  mm. The maximum crack width at a specified peak deformation angle and the residual crack width (with the applied loading set back to zero) at each measurement point are also {{recorded in the}} experiment. Additionally, in this study, the crack width measured along the perpendicular direction to the axis of the crack propagation is used to construction the design formulas.|$|E
40|$|An {{aspect of}} an {{operational}} nation building {{would be a}} country that has a sustainable construction industry whereby it is self-sufficient in the production of its building materials, {{but that is not the}} case. The aim of this study was to assess the entrepreneurial opportunities in the production of Building materials. A literature review approach and desk study using secondary data of net income (Profit after tax) during the period 2010 – 2014 of eight (8) building materials companies, publicly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) were used for the study. From the study, it is evident that there are entrepreneurial prospects in the Housing and infrastructural needs, Maintenance and repairs, need for quality building materials to avoid Building collapse. These entrepreneurial opportunities gives room for huge production of Building materials such as <b>cement,</b> <b>paint,</b> tiles and steel reinforcement. In conclusion, there is a dire need for investment in the production of building materials locally rather than the heavy reliance on importation. In this exasperating times when oil prices have dwindled, the study calls for diversification to other sector. It was recommended that internally and international short term loan acquisition schemes supported by the federal government should be made available to entrepreneurs in production of building materials. Allied facilities such as improved power sector and material protection policy on imported building materials should be fast tracke...|$|E

50|$|Underground {{hydrological}} {{resources are}} a substantial supplemental {{source of water}} in Delhi, especially in the affluent sections of the city. In the residential plots called the‘farmhouses’ almost every household draws from this resource. Though water-storing rocks, i.e. aquifers, are renewed as surface rain-water percolates down, they are not inexhaustible. Delhi’s aquifers stand in danger of depletion on account of excessive use. Furthermore, rampant construction activity has contaminated them with <b>cement,</b> <b>paints,</b> varnishes and other construction materials; leaky, poorly constructed and maintained sewage lines have added to the contamination. This is an irremediable loss, as aquifers, once polluted, cannot be decontaminated; they have no exposure to air and sunlight or to micro-organisms which clear-up chemical or biological pollutants.|$|R

50|$|The {{park was}} {{designed}} {{to be more than a}} collection of pictureque landscapes; it was meant as a place for amusement and recreation, with sports fields, bandstands, cafes, shooting galleries, riding stables, boating on the lakes, and other attractions. In 1855, Gabriel Davioud, a graduate of Ecole des Beaux-Arts, was named the chief architect of the new Service of Promenades and Plantations. He was commissioned to design 24 pavilions and chalets, plus cafes, gatehouses, boating docks, and kiosks. He designed the gatehouses where the guardians of the park lived to look like rustic cottages. He had a real Swiss chalet built out of wood in Switzerland and transported to Paris, where it was reassembled on an island in the lake and became a restaurant. He built another restaurant next to the park's most picturesque feature, the Grand Cascade. He designed artificial grottoes made of rocks and cement, and bridges and balustrades made of <b>cement</b> <b>painted</b> to look like wood.
