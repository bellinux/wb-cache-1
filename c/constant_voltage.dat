A <b>constant</b> <b>voltage,</b> direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as alternating current, can be used.

This is important because most applications of SMAW are manual, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a <b>constant</b> <b>voltage</b> power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult. However, because the current is not maintained absolutely constant, skilled welders performing complicated welds can vary the arc length to cause minor fluctuations in the current.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, GMAW was {{developed}} by the Battelle Memorial Institute. It used a smaller diameter electrode and a <b>constant</b> <b>voltage</b> power source developed by H. E. Kennedy. It offered a high deposition rate, but the high cost of inert gases limited its use to non-ferrous materials and prevented cost savings. In 1953, the use of carbon dioxide as a welding atmosphere {{was developed}}, and it quickly gained popularity in GMAW, since it made welding steel more economical. In 1958 and 1959, the short-arc variation of GMAW was released, which increased welding versatility and made the welding of thin materials possible while relying on smaller electrode wires and more advanced power supplies. It quickly became the most popular GMAW variation.|$|E

5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and <b>constant</b> <b>voltage</b> power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. <b>Constant</b> <b>voltage</b> power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E

25|$|In 1971, the {{grounded}} bridge amplifier {{design was}} invented by Crown, allowing greater output power without increasing amplifier size and also gave lower distortion, less thermal stress and greater reliability.

Crown received a patent for the invention in 1974. After proving itself in the field, the topology was used to design the Microtech MT-1000 in 1984. Further development of the grounded bridge yielded the Macrotech line which set a new standard for touring sound reinforcement in 1992 with the MA-5000VZ.|$|E
25|$|The ZBD patents {{included}} two other major interrelated innovations: one concerning {{the use of}} parallel connected, instead of series connected, utilization loads, the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher (initially 1400V to 2000V) than the voltage of utilization loads (100V initially preferred). When employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces. The other essential milestone was the introduction of 'voltage source, voltage intensive' (VSVI) systems' by the invention of <b>constant</b> <b>voltage</b> generators in 1885.

25|$|Dennard scaling – This {{suggests}} that power requirements are proportional to area (both {{voltage and current}} being proportional to length) for transistors. Combined with Moore's law, performance per watt would grow {{at roughly the same}} rate as transistor density, doubling every 1–2 years. According to Dennard scaling transistor dimensions are scaled by 30% (0.7x) every technology generation, thus reducing their area by 50%. This reduces the delay by 30% (0.7x) and therefore increases operating frequency by about 40% (1.4x). Finally, to keep electric field <b>constant,</b> <b>voltage</b> is reduced by 30%, reducing energy by 65% and power (at 1.4x frequency) by 50%.f Therefore, in every technology generation transistor density doubles, circuit becomes 40% faster, while power consumption (with twice the number of transistors) stays the same.|$|E
25|$|The {{negative}} feedback into the difference amplifier allows the amplifier {{to compare the}} input to the actual output. The amplified signal from Q1 is directly fed to the second stage, Q3, which is a common emitter stage that provides further amplification of the signal and the DC bias for the output stages, Q4 and Q5. R6 provides the load for Q3 (a better design would probably use some form of active load here, such as a constant-current sink). So far, all of the amplifier is operating in class A. The output pair are arranged in class-AB push–pull, also called a complementary pair. They provide {{the majority of the}} current amplification (while consuming low quiescent current) and directly drive the load, connected via DC-blocking capacitor C2. The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of <b>constant</b> <b>voltage</b> bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage firmly into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} contributions for {{a general}} description for the derivation of a non-contacting charge estimation and discharge actuation algorithm for the LISA Pathfinder test masses free-flying in a gravitational field in open space. The estimation principle {{is based on the}} application of forces that depend on the charge present on the mass. The discharge principle is based on the photoelectric emission of surfaces illuminated by UV light. The discharge actuation can be supported via the application of <b>constant</b> bias <b>voltages.</b> The content of this work contributes to the derivation of a linearized time variant model valid for any combination of <b>constant</b> or variable <b>voltages</b> that could be present on the electrodes surrounding the test mass. In particular this thesis investigates the application of <b>constant</b> <b>voltages</b> and sinusoidal test signal voltages simultaneously, such that charge estimation and discharge actuation supported by <b>constant</b> bias <b>voltages</b> is possible. Furthermore, the discharge process is analyzed in order to obtain a model suitable for on-board utilization. As a result of this analysis, possible improvements of this model are provided and discussed. Integral part of this thesis is the identification of a control scheme that is able to perform discharge actuation in the fastest way possible. Therefore, a closed-loop control scheme has been designed which is based on continuously estimating the test mass charge and to apply discharge actuation using <b>constant</b> bias <b>voltages</b> at the same time. Finally, the designed fast discharge closed-loop control scheme is traded against an alternative approach currently used as a baseline.

500|$|Most {{applications}} of {{gas metal arc}} welding use a <b>constant</b> <b>voltage</b> power supply. [...] As a result, any change in arc length (which is directly related to voltage) results in a large change in heat input and current. A shorter arc length causes a much greater heat input, which makes the wire electrode melt more quickly and thereby restore the original arc length. This helps operators keep the arc length consistent even when manually welding with hand-held welding guns. To achieve a similar effect, sometimes a constant current power source is used in combination with an arc voltage-controlled wire feed unit. [...] In this case, a change in arc length makes the wire feed rate adjust to maintain a relatively constant arc length. In rare circumstances, a constant current power source and a constant wire feed rate unit might be coupled, especially for the welding of metals with high thermal conductivities, such as aluminum. [...] This grants the operator additional control over the heat input into the weld, but requires significant skill to perform successfully.|$|E
