5|$|Hospice Medical Director: The hospice medical director, a physician, often {{provides}} the most support to the clinical staff providing care to the patient and family. The medical director may also provide medical <b>care</b> <b>if</b> the primary physician is unavailable or if the patient {{does not have a}} primary care provider. The hospice medical director is also required under Medicare to recertify patients.|$|E

5|$|Occasionally, {{in females}} where {{ulceration}} is correlated to the menstrual cycle or to birth control pills, progestogen or {{a change in}} birth control may be beneficial. Use of nicotine replacement therapy {{for people who have}} developed oral ulceration after stopping smoking has also been reported. Starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition. Trauma can be reduced by avoiding rough or sharp foodstuffs and by brushing teeth with <b>care.</b> <b>If</b> sodium lauryl sulfate is suspected to be the cause, avoidance of products containing this chemical may be useful and prevent recurrence in some individuals. Similarly patch testing may indicate that food allergy is responsible, and the diet modified accordingly. If investigations reveal deficiency states, correction of the deficiency may result in resolution of the ulceration. For example, {{there is some evidence that}} vitamin B12 supplementation may prevent recurrence in some individuals.|$|E
5|$|The cost of {{hospice care}} may {{be met by}} health {{insurance}} providers, including Medicare or Medicaid for eligible Americans. Hospice is covered 100% with no co-pay or deductible by Medicare Part A except that patients are responsible for a copay for outpatient drugs and respite <b>care,</b> <b>if</b> needed. (Respite care may be necessary, for instance, if a family member who is providing home hospice care is briefly unable to perform his or her duties and an alternative care provider becomes necessary.) As of 2008, Medicare was responsible for around 80% of hospice payments, reimbursing providers differently from county to county with a higher rate for inpatient hospice care. A lower rate is paid for home care, with a higher rate paid for round-the-clock nursing care {{in order to get}} a patient's symptoms under control.|$|E
5|$|On Christmas Day, Archie tells Ian the CD of the {{recording}} is under Ian's Christmas tree for Jane, but Ian fails to find it. Archie tells Janine that they should skip Christmas dinner as {{he has made a}} surprise treasure hunt for her. Janine eventually finds an envelope containing a one-way ticket to Poland and Archie throws her out onto the street telling her he knows how she and Ryan tried to double-cross him. Archie is visited by Jack who threatens to kill him if he hurts Ronnie again. Archie finds Ian searching his living room for the CD and Archie says it is on his laptop and he can make copies at any time, threatening Ian with a phone call to Jane, before ejecting him from the pub. Sam returns and attempts to confront Archie but he shuts the door on her. Ronnie then arrives and tells him with no emotion that he will not make her care for him and she would not <b>care</b> <b>if</b> he died. Archie throws her out onto the street reminding her that it was the exact spot she pushed Danielle onto the night she died.|$|E

25|$|Almost 20% of {{the people}} wanted to use {{whatever}} treatment that might postpone death. About the same number said that, given a terminal illness, they would choose assisted suicide.

25|$|Among PhilHealthâ€™s work in incentive-based {{payments}} is {{a scheme}} {{that has been}} piloted in 30 local government hospitals since 2002 but has not spread. The scheme is called the Quality Improvement Demonstration Study (QIDS).

Clinical vignettes focus on the illnesses of children less than six years of age.|$|E

25|$|Some {{physicians}} and patients may consider having lower limbs venous ultrasonography {{to screen for}} deep vein thrombosis after knee replacement. However, this kind of screening should be done only when indicated because to perform it routinely would be unnecessary health <b>care.</b> <b>If</b> a medical condition exists that could cause deep vein thrombosis, a physician can choose to treat patients with cryotherapy and intermittent pneumatic compression as a preventive measure.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} blood {{substitutes}} have been explored (and still are), but thus far they all suffer from many challenges. Most {{attempts to find}} a suitable alternative to blood thus far have concentrated on cell-free hemoglobin solutions. Blood substitutes could make transfusions more readily available in emergency medicine and in pre-hospital EMS <b>care.</b> <b>If</b> successful, such a blood substitute could save many lives, particularly in trauma where massive blood loss results. Hemopure, a hemoglobin-based therapy, is approved for use in South Africa.|$|E

25|$|Temporal polyethism is not {{adaptive}} {{because of}} maximized efficiency; indeed older workers are actually more efficient at brood care than younger workers in some ant species. Rather it allows workers {{with the lowest}} remaining life expectancy to perform the most dangerous tasks. Older workers tend to perform riskier tasks, such as foraging, which has high risks of predation and parasitism, while younger workers perform less dangerous tasks, such as brood <b>care.</b> <b>If</b> workers experience injuries, which shortens their life expectancies, they will start foraging sooner than healthy workers of the same age.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, certain {{costs are}} {{difficult}} to avoid and are shared by everyone, such as the costs of housing, pensions, education and health <b>care.</b> <b>If</b> the state does not provide these services, then for those on lower incomes, the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes {{are those who are}} worse equipped to manage their finances. Secondly, aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt. The result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability.|$|E
25|$|Hospice {{benefits}} are also provided under Part A of Medicare for terminally ill persons {{with less than}} six months to live, as determined by the patient's physician. The terminally ill person must sign a statement that hospice care has been chosen over other Medicare-covered benefits, (e.g. assisted living or hospital care). Treatment provided includes pharmaceutical products for symptom control and pain relief as well as other services not otherwise covered by Medicare such as grief counseling. Hospice is covered 100% with no co-pay or deductible by Medicare Part A except that patients are responsible for a copay for outpatient drugs and respite <b>care,</b> <b>if</b> needed.|$|E
