40|$|Abstract. In this note, a new {{characterization}} of gaps between two subspaces of a Hilbert space is established. Let M and N be two closed linear subspaces of a Hilbert space H. The gap between M and N (see [2]) {{is defined by}} (1) gap(M,N) = max{δ(M,N), δ(N,M) }, where δ(M,N) = sup{dist(x,N) : x ∈M, ‖ x ‖ ≤ 1 }, and the <b>conorm</b> between M and N is defined by (2) γ(M,N) = inf{ ‖ x ‖: x ∈M, dist(x,N) ≥ 1 }. In this note, the specific representations of the gap and the <b>conorm</b> between two subspaces are established. For two closed subspaces M and N of H, denote H 1 =M∩N, H 2 =M∩N⊥, H 3 = M ⊥ ∩ N, H 4 = M ⊥ ∩ N ⊥ and let H 5 = M ∩ (H (⊕ 4 i= 1 Hi)) and H 6 = (H (⊕ 4 i= 1 Hi)) H 5.
