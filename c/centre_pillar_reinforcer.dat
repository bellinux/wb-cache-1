This openness is achieved through glazed walls and a large stairwell. The glass is framed with distinctive orange-painted metal. The platform level features exposed concrete walls, with a long strip of skylights above the tracks with the same orange framing used throughout the station. Rectangular prism benches with rectangular tiles of yellow, orange, and brown hues are unique to the station. Similar tiles are used on the floors and <b>centre</b> <b>pillars.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Light's base {{consisted}} of seven wrought iron piles {{embedded in the}} sands. Each was 16 ft long with cast-iron screw bases 3 ft in diameter. The six corner piles formed a hexagonal platform of 50 ft diameter. (The seventh pile served as a <b>centre</b> <b>pillar.)</b> The platform supported the lantern and a two-storey building to house the keeper. Construction began in 1839 and the lantern was lit on 6 June 1840. The building was destroyed by fire in 1948 and not replaced. After the fire, the beacon was made automatic and eventually replaced by a lighted buoy in 1979, leaving behind a derelict structure.|$|R
40|$|In this {{communication}} {{two different}} issues are addressed from both an experimental and numerical standpoint, concerning cutting-edge research on masonry <b>pillars</b> <b>reinforced</b> by Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) elements. The first issue deals with delamination phenomena in curved pillars subjected to shear tests. Data from an experimental campaign are compared with prediction of nonlinear finite element models. The second issue concerns optical monitoring of delamination phenomena of external reinforcement from a (flat) masonry pillar, {{by means of}} a 2 D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) procedure. Also in this case, experimental data enriched by kinematic full-field measurements are interpreted in light of numerical predictions. These studies are expected to provide viable routes to follow in order to investigate the multi-scale behavior of masonry elements, possibly reinforced, in view of civil applications and of the health care of monumental heritage...|$|R

50|$|There {{were two}} places where water was drawn in Palos: the {{fountain}} of Villafrías, at the exit of the estuary, facing the Isla de Saltés, and the Fontanilla, outside of the historic center of the city, but immediately to its east. An estuary of the Río Tinto came practically to its base, with a pier that provided the most {{direct access to the}} town from the sea. This was almost certainly the pier from which Columbus's ships departed. On the way from the Puerta de los Novios of the Church of Saint George the Martyr (Iglesia de San Jorge Mártir), walking toward the nearby site of the former pier, one finds the Fontanilla, the former public fountain constructed on a base that dates back to Roman times, and protected by a tetrapylum, a sort of gazebo, constructed of stone in the 13th century in the Mudéjar style, with a quadrangular base, with the protective roof having a hemispheric vaulted exterior and a pyramidal interior. The support consists of four slightly depressed semicircular arches, supported on angular <b>pillar</b> <b>reinforced</b> by abutments.|$|R

50|$|Four road bridges have {{spanned the}} Cudgegong River which {{flows through the}} town. The first bridge was a {{suspension}} bridge that was washed away by floods around 1867.

A third bridge built by Mr Eddy Fitzgerald replaced the second in 1890 and was a little further up the River. The fourth bridge, and the only one remaining, which is still used today was built in 1948 to line up with the Bylong Road.A railway bridge also spans the Cudgegong River approximately 100 metres upriver of the present road bridge.

Young men were required to serve as soldiers until they were about 30 years old, after which they were allowed to marry. A conversation between King Cetshwayo and the Norwegian missionary, Rev JL Kyllingstad in 1876 was recorded as follows: [...] But look here, Umfundisi (teacher) We cannot permit that our soldiers run to the school and become believers; because then they are running away from the King's service, and we lose our army. The believers are of no use to us and never serve us, as they are lost to us and the service when they attend school. We must refuse permission for you to take them away from us and do not permit that a soldier should become a believer.|$|R

50|$|During Japan's Bubble Economy, {{sales of}} the Century doubled (from 1,027 in 1985 to 2,117 in 1989). But even the Century wasn't enough for these heady days of luxury, and in October 1989 the Century Limousine appeared. This was 650 mm longer for an overall length of 5770 mm, on a 3510 mm wheelbase, {{approximately}} the same dimensions as a Cadillac de Ville series, Lincoln Town Car, Mercedes-Benz S-Class, or a Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit. The Limousine also received a standard padded vinyl roof and an opera window in the <b>centre</b> <b>pillar,</b> where the stretch was placed. It also uses 150 mm wider rear doors, for a more balanced design and ease of entry. An annual production of 60 was planned.

50|$|This {{station was}} the {{terminus}} {{of the last}} ever proper branch line {{to be built in}} Ireland, when the Great Southern & Western Railway opened a line just north of Kilkenny on the Portlaoise via Abbeyleix line to the coal mining town of Castlecomer in 1922. The branch lost its passenger service only ten years after opening, however it remained open for coal and general goods until January 1963, closing along with the Portlaoise to Kilkenny line. The corrugated iron station building and single platform at Castlecomer Station are now long gone, the site now occupied by the 'Railway Garage'. The trackbed of the coal mine extension from the station to the coal mines outside Castlecomer town is now a footpath. Many of the concrete piers which carried the railway across the Dinin River are still in situ just south of Dysart crossing, visible from the adjacent N78 road. You can also still see the left-side concrete bridge abutment at the Cloghogue Bridge, Chatsworth Street. This bridge spanned either side of the two roads here (R694/R426) with a <b>centre</b> <b>pillar</b> support.Now the closest train stations are MacDonagh station/Kilkenny railway station, then Carlow, Athy and Portlaoise train stations.|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1958 Lancia {{turned to}} Carrozzeria Viotti, to build a 3-door estate based third series Appia. Named Appia Giardinetta—Viotti's {{trademark}} designation for estate cars—the production version eas unveiled at the November 1959 Turin Motor Show. Chassis was extensively modified, receiving a new 808.21 type code: a three-door layout was chosen, adding a <b>centre</b> <b>pillar</b> (the Appia saloon had none) to strengthen the body, and the rear part of the platform was altered to lower the boot opening. Despite looking very similar, little more than lamps and interior details were carried over from the saloon's bodywork. The body was widened 6 cm, which in turn required a wider dashboard, new bumpers, grille, and windscreen. Inside leatherette and rubber mats took place of Lancia's traditional wool cloth and carpets; the rear seats folded down forming a completely flat 1.5 m loading area. The complexity of this development and lack of economies of scale reflected on the list price, which was approximately 25% higher than the saloon's. Due to the additional weight, the manufacturer's claimed top speed for the Giardinetta was down to 120 km/h. In total just 300 Giardinettas were made.|$|R

5000|$|The Ibis-headed god Thoth was, {{with his}} {{accompanying}} emblems, the Ibis and the Cynocephalus monkey, {{the most conspicuous}} among the sculptures upon the great portico of the temple of Hermopolis. His designation in inscriptions was [...] "The Lord of Eshmoon". This portico was a work of the Pharaonic era, but the erections of the Ptolemies at Hermopolis were {{on a scale of}} great extent and magnificence and, although raised by Greek monarchs, are essentially Egyptian in their conception and execution. The portico, the only remnant of the temple, consists of a double row of pillars, six in each row. The architraves are formed of five stones; each passes from the <b>centre</b> of one <b>pillar</b> to that of the next, according to a well-known usage with Egyptian builders. The intercolumnation of the <b>centre</b> <b>pillars</b> is wider than that of the others; and the stone over the centre is twenty-five feet and six inches long. These columns were painted yellow, red and blue in alternate bands. There is also a peculiarity in the pillars of the Hermopolitan portico peculiar to themselves, or at least discovered only again in the temple of Gournou. (Dénon, L'Egypte, plate 41.) Instead of being formed of large masses placed horizontally above each other, they are composed of irregular pieces, so artfully adjusted {{that it is difficult to}} detect the lines of junction. The bases of these columns represent the lower leaves of the lotus; next come a number of concentric rings, like the hoops of a cask; and above these the pillars appear like bunches of reeds held together by horizontal bonds. Including the capital, each column is about 40 feet high; the greatest circumference is about 28½ feet, about five feet from the ground, for they diminish in thickness both towards the base and towards the capital. The widest part of the intercolumnation is 17 feet; the other pillars are 13 feet apart.|$|R
