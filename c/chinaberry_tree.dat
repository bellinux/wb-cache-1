40|$|Have {{you seen}} {{red and black}} insects {{crawling}} all over your grass and {{up the sides of}} your house? Do you have a Goldenrain tree or <b>Chinaberry</b> <b>tree</b> in your yard or close by? Then most likely the insect you are seeing is the harmless Jadera haematoloma. This is a seed-eating insect. These bugs are providing a service to you. They are eating the seeds of the tree so that you do not have thousands of baby trees sprouting up under the adult tree. In central Florida, April and May are usually the peak months for Jadera bugs. The adults are 9. 5 - 13. 5 mm long (with wings) and 3 - 4 mm wide. Their color is mostly black except for reddish eyes, shoulders and border area of the abdomen. The nymphs (young) are mostly reddish in color, with the mid-section, antennae, beak and legs brown to black. CONTROL: Usually, no control is necessary. A small concentration on a plant can often be destroyed by hand collecting. If the bugs are a nuisance in lawns or playgrounds, removing the tree seeds by raking shortly after the seedpods or lanterns have fallen to the ground is recommended, but should be done when the trees first drop the seedpods, before the seeds detach. Attempting to rake them when the bugs become noticeable in March or April, after the seeds have detached from the seedpods, is too late. The Goldenrain tree or <b>Chinaberry</b> <b>tree</b> can be removed- the Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council has listed the Goldenrain tree as a Category II invasive species, and the <b>Chinaberry</b> <b>tree</b> as a Category I invasive species. The preference of Jadera haematoloma for seeds of these trees may help to prevent unwanted germination of the seeds and the invasive spread of these trees. If you remove the invasive tree, please replace it with a preferred tree (preferably a native tree). Call and ask for our publication on "Favorite Trees. "...|$|E

40|$|Sustainable Built Environments Senior CapstoneThis study {{analyzes}} {{the efficiency of}} non-native trees in the Sonoran Desert. Some non-native trees highlighted as examples are <b>Chinaberry</b> <b>tree</b> (Melia azedarach) and the Cottonwood tree (Populus deltoides) sometimes referred as Alamo tree in the Southern part of the Sonoran Desert. The overall idea is to consider the non-native diversity available in the Sonoran Desert and its benefits. Keep {{in mind that the}} Sonoran Desert spreads throughout the Arizona, a section in California and in Northern Mexico in the state of Sonora, and Baja California Sur; however our focus is mainly on the area around Tucson and Sonora, México. Desert plants typically require little water and maintenance, which tends {{to be one of the}} biggest environmental benefits for landscape designers. Landscape designers often present a landscape that will maintain itself according to the resources in its surrounding. Desert plants are preferred in the northern part of the Sonoran Desert because they tend to fall into a sustainable type of garden. This study consists of four sections: the argument, relevant examples, results and a potential. The first section exposes myths behind non-native plants and considers the efficiency of their performance in the Sonoran Desert. The efficiency of the non-native plants considers the performance of the plant at a social, ecological and economical level. The next section mentions three different nonnative plants commonly seen in the Sonoran Desert. These plants are the <b>Chinaberry</b> <b>tree,</b> the Alamo tree and the Red Pistache tree. Each tree contributes differently to the Sonoran Desert and improve the biodiversity at their site. The third section of the study provides a solution for non-native plants to have a sustainable performance in the Sonoran Desert. The last section compiles all the previous sections to identify significant change in the efficiency of non-native plants. As part of the results, one can consider the non-native plant disturbance to be essential in the Sonoran Desert. The Sonoran Desert is a location that adapts to extreme heat in the summer and due to its change in elevation also provides a diversity of plants for the cold winters. Therefore, this change in climates throughout the year allows nonnative plants to adapt at a faster pace than they would elsewhere. Some suggestions to mention in this paper include the adaptation of non-native plants nearby to residential homes. Residential homes require more trees that can perform a good job at providing shade to the building during the summer season...|$|E
30|$|The <b>Chinaberry</b> <b>tree,</b> Melia azedarach L. (Sapindales: Meliaceae), is a {{deciduous}} tree often {{grown for}} its medicinal uses and for shade or ornament on roadsides. The non-conventional insecticidal effects of extracts or compounds isolated from Meliaceae trees include: partial reduction or complete inhibition of fecundity and egg hatchability, reduction of {{life span of}} adults, oviposition deterrence, antifeedant effects, and insect growth regulatory effects at molting (Ascher 1993). M. azedarach {{has been shown to}} possess many insecticidal effects against different pest species (Shin-Foon 1987; Ascher et al. 1995; Nardo et al. 1997; Valladares et al. 1997; Jazzar and Abou-Fakhr Hammad 2003; Abou-Fakhr Hammad and McAuslane 2006, 2010; Al-Akhras 2010). A limited number of studies have dealt with the use of botanicals against the citrus leafminer. Amiri-Besheli (2011) indicated that the use of biopesticides such as Tondexir® extracts from hot pepper, discouraged CLM adults from laying eggs on leaves and posed lower risk to humans and the environment than other pesticides. Pepper extracts worked better on soft bodied insects during the larval stage as the chemical was able to penetrate the leaves. Howard (1993) also found that the 2 biorationals, Avid (abamectin 0.15 EC) and Azatin (60  ppm azadirachtin) with Triton B- 1956 spreader-sticker (Rhom & Haas Co., Philadelphia, PA), prevented damage by CLM when sprayed on leaves prior to oviposition by this insect; these sprays were timed just as trees were flushing.|$|E

Regression analysis of these dimensions as a dependent variable and age as an independent variable produced different models {{that can be used for}} estimating the growth of the measured dimensions of these two species.

40|$|DECOLONIZING MIMESIS IN THE WORKS OF JESSIE FAUSET, DAVID BRADLEY, AND NELLY ROSARIO Victoria Alicia Chevalier, Ph. D. Cornell University, 2007 Decolonizing Mimesis in the Works of Jessie Fauset, David Bradley, and Nelly Rosario historicizes the {{category}} of mimesis by tracing its function as a modality in 20 th Century African American Literature. Decolonizing Mimesis interprets the modalities of mimesis across disciplinary schools of thought as a historicized literary function, not a trans-historical category. For this reason, in different historical contexts in African American literature, mimesis takes on different possibilities for the black subject of language in a decolonizing frame. The works upon which I focus engage what occurs when the problem of mimesis as a category of interpretation presses up against the problem of African American representation. Jessie Fauset?s Plum Bun and The <b>Chinaberry</b> <b>Tree,</b> David Bradley?s The Chaneysville Incident, and Nelly Rosario?s Song of the Water Saints engage {{the ways in which}} black subjects in representation destabilize the logic of identity as irreducible difference that underpins scientific racism and racist practices in America, and through contact with America; simultaneously, these works insist upon an understanding of a shared vernacular, because inherited history constitutive of ?race? through the attainment of a decolonizing and, therefore, oppositional position within discourse. This position within language is specifically rendered through the literary tropes ellipsis, caesura, and aporia. These tropes are themselves figures for a blank space, a silence, or a pause whose presence in these texts is visible and invisible, legible and illegible. Decolonizing Mimesis argues that the transformative work of identification, as opposed to identity, is the primary project with which the aspects of the interior world are represented throughout these texts. In an attempt to stave off the putative annihilation of racial uplift, these works argue for a black world in which play is possible, indeed necessary, for decolonizing representational properties acquired by black subjects. Although the early chapters of the dissertation focus on the literary project of the Harlem Renaissance as it is understood by Jessie Fauset, I pay attention throughout to the way the novels are concerned with modalities of mimesis expressed in psychoanalytic, narrative, and aesthetic paradigms, particularly regarding the ritualization of history and memory. I demonstrate, for instance, that Fauset?s work relies on figures of visuality and visual technologies to organize modern identification rituals and subject-formation established in psychoanalysis; Nelly Rosario?s work constitutes the limits of a nascent and oppositional Caribbean historical narrative represented by the discontinuities of an alternative and black postmodernity; and both confront history through visual and narrative mimetic models that necessarily fail to inscribe a black feminine subject across the fallacy of binaries ?self/other,? ?masculine/feminine,? ?white/black. ? Finally, my chapter on David Bradley?s The Chaneysville Incident argues that this text participates in a similar logic which motivates Fauset?s and Rosario?s work. A potential alternative sexuality, and therefore a different relation to memory and history link Bradley?s work to Fauset and Rosario?s representation of repressed, black subjects. The novels I focus upon in this dissertation argue that history inevitably brings itself to bear; therefore the only way to effect literary and social change is through praxis, through a confrontation with linguistic and figurative historical forms, themselves inherently political...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I have {{assessed}} and modelled {{invasion of}} alien plant {{species in the}} forest of the southeastern United States. There are over 380 recognized invasive plants in southeastern forests and grasslands with 53 ranked as high-to-medium risk to natural communities. I have focused on ten of these: Chinese lespedeza, tall fescue, Japanese honeysuckle, Chinese privet, autumn olive, princesstree, silktree, <b>chinaberry,</b> <b>tree</b> of heaven, tallowtree. Assessing them at differing scales, locally (Chapter 2 and 3), eco-regionally (Chapter 4 and 5) and regionally (Chapters 6 and 7), using field based measurements integrated with remotely sensed and digital datasets, and applying both parametric and non-parametric modelling approaches. Data from field based measurements as well as digitally available sources was evaluated, bringing together freely available data with time consuming, intensively collected data. Once models were developed application to assessing long term impacts was done by integrating potential climate change scenarios. At the local level Chinese lespedeza and Japanese Honeysuckle were the most prevalent, with models {{at the local level}} dominated by remotely sensed variables. At an eco-regional level Japanese honeysuckle was the most prevalent with models primarily dominated by environmental variables. At a regional level, where only trees were assessed, potential distributions of the invasive species ranged from 12 to 33 percent of the southeastern forests under current conditions with this dramatically increasing for chinaberry and tallowtree under most climate change scenarios, up as high as 66 percent of southeastern forest sites. In this thesis information on anthropogenic factors added some value to the models, however it was rarely dominant. Roads and land use (proportion of forest or distance to forest) were the most useful anthropogenic variables. In all models evaluated, only six times did any one anthropogenic variable represent more than 25 percent of the models, four of these were at the local scale. At the regional and eco-regional level, roads had a greater than 25 percent contribution to the silktree models, at a local level, distance to forest and distance roads contributed more than 25 percent to three of the species evaluated, sawtooth oak, Japanese honeysuckle and privet. Human activities have the most influence on invasion progression through dispersal (movement and introduction rate) and disturbance of the landscape (increased resource availability). Anthropogenic variables such as roads are likely to be a mechanism of spread, thus the more a model is driven by anthropogenic variables, the more likely the invasive plant is to be {{in the early stages of}} invasion process. Thus our results suggest that many of these species have moved through the first stages of invasion. Environmental characteristics play an important role in determining a site’s vulnerability to invasion. At an eco-region and regional scale, environmental characteristics dominated (> 50 %) all but one model (silktree at the regional scale). At the eco-region level elevation was the dominant variable, and at a regional level minimum temperature was the dominant variable. These have some correlation, with higher elevation often relating to lower temperatures, particularly at a smaller scale. This confirms the validity of matching the climate ranges of native species with the range of potential invasion, and the approach of integrating elevation, latitude and longitude to estimate potential distribution. It also suggests that climate change will influence the distribution and that variation in climate should be integrated into models. Two different modelling approaches, logistic regression and maximum entropy, were used throughout my thesis, and applied to the same data. Agreement between different modelling types adds strength to conclusions, while disagreement can assist in asking further questions. The inclusion in the models of similar variables with the same direction of relationships gives confidence to any inference about the importance of these variables. The geographical agreement between models adds confidence to the probability of occurrence in the area. Alternatively using the same model but different datasets can give you similar information. Overall for all models created by both logistic regression and MaxEnt, the logistic regression had slightly better omission rates and the MaxEnt model had better AUC’s. Logistic regression models also often predicted larger geographical areas of occurrences when the threshold of maximum sensitivity plus specificity was used, thus the lower omission rates is related to the less stringent model that predicts a larger area. The selection of appropriate data to answer the question was shown to be fundamental in Chapter 7. When data were used outside of the area of interest it generalized the models and increased the potential for invasion significantly. There was more value in the intensive surveyed data but this was less dramatic than in using the defined areas of interest to select the data for models...|$|E
