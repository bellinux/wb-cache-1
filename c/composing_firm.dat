We compared the monthly returns of a portfolio <b>composed</b> by <b>firms</b> present in the «Best Companies to Work» list with two other benchmark portfolios, using the four-factor model proposed by Carhart (1997), from January 2010 to December 2014. Our {{results show that the}} BCWE 600 portfolio outperforms both benchmark portfolios. In other words, companies classified as Best Companies to Work generated 0. 40 %/month and 4. 94 %/year higher stock returns than their peers over the 2010 - 2014 period. Also, the market risk in portfolio BCWE 600 is inferior compared to other portfolios.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the firm size (SZ) and the book-to-market ratio (BM) cannot fully explain stock returns on prior-return-based {{portfolios}} in Japan. The overreaction effect after controlling for SZ and BM effects is significant and {{plays an important role}} in explaining the zero-investment returns on the loser-to-winner strategy. Motivated by this observation, we construct a portfolio whose return serves as a new factor that mimics overreaction. This new factor improves the performances of the threefactor model [Fama and French (1993) ] in several prior-return-based and characteristics-based portfolios. Key words: characteristics, prior returns, overreaction, risk factors. JEL Classification: G 11, G 12 iii The characteristics-based strategy, which calls for selling the portfolio <b>composed</b> of <b>firms</b> with low book-to-market value (BM) and large size (SZ) and buying the portfolio <b>composed</b> of <b>firms</b> with large BM and small SZ, has been found to outperform the market. At least three competing hypotheses have been offered for this empirical evidence. The first one is based on the risk-return tradeoff – the higher returns are compensation for higher systematic risk.

I can conceive very well that a man <b>composed,</b> <b>firm,</b> and collected in himself, conscious of not only integrity, but known integrity, conscious of a whole life beyond the reach of suspicion,--that a man placed in such a situation might oppose general character to general accusation, and stand collected in himself, poised on his own base, and defying all the calumnies in the world. But as it shows a great and is a proof of a virtuous mind to despise calumny, it is the proof of a guilty mind to despise a specific accusation, when made before a competent authority, and with competent means to prove it. As Mr. Hastings's conduct was what no man living expected, I will venture to say that no expression can do it justice but his own.
