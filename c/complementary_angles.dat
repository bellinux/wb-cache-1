If the two <b>complementary</b> <b>angles</b> are adjacent their non-shared sides form a right angle. In Euclidean geometry, the two acute angles in a right triangle are complementary, because {{the sum of}} internal angles of a triangle is 180 degrees, and the right angle itself accounts for ninety degrees.|$|E

50|$|In astronomy, the {{altitude}} in the horizontal coordinate {{system and the}} zenith angle are <b>complementary</b> <b>angles,</b> with the horizon perpendicular to the zenith. The astronomical meridian is also determined by the zenith, and {{is defined as a}} circle on the celestial sphere that passes through the zenith, nadir, and the celestial poles. A zenith telescope is a type of telescope designed to point straight up at or near the zenith, and used for precision measurement of star positions, to simplify telescope construction, or both. The NASA Orbital Debris Observatory and the Large Zenith Telescope are both zenith telescopes since the use of liquid mirrors meant these telescopes could only point straight up.|$|E
5000|$|If one {{angle of}} a {{triangle}} is 90 degrees {{and one of}} the other angles is known, the third is thereby fixed, because the three angles of any triangle add up to 180 degrees. The two acute angles therefore add up to 90 degrees: they are <b>complementary</b> <b>angles.</b> The shape of a triangle is completely determined, except for similarity, by the angles. Once the angles are known, the ratios of the sides are determined, regardless of the overall size of the triangle. If the length of one of the sides is known, the other two are determined. These ratios are given by the following trigonometric functions of the known angle A, where a, [...] b and c refer to the lengths of the sides in the accompanying figure: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{side cut}} {{is located at}} the {{intersection}} of the side cut of jack rafters row and the pitch column on the Steel square. There is a row for the difference in length of jacks, 16 and 24 inch centers on the blade. The tangents are directly proportional for both centers.The tangent is in a base 12. The tangent x 12 = side cut of jack rafters. This corresponds to the side cut on the Steel square. The <b>complementary</b> <b>angles</b> of the arc tan are used on most angle measuring devises in construction. The tangent of hip, valley, and jack rafters are less than 1.00 in all pitches above 0°. An eighteen pitch has a side cut angle of 29.07° and a two pitch has a side cut angle of 44.56° for jack rafters. This is a variation of 15.5° between pitches.|$|E

We use the similar study methodology to find relevant bug reports for our analysis but we provide a <b>complementary</b> <b>angle</b> by studying the effects of recent concurrency bugs with a more fine-grained classification than mapping bugs into deadlock and not-deadlock bug classes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{classical}} Abloy design {{consists of}} a notched semi-cylindrical key, and a lock with detainer discs with holes ranging from a semicircle (180°) to a 3/4 circle (270°). The key is inserted and rotated 90 degrees. Notches, machined to an angle, correspond to <b>complementary</b> <b>angles</b> in the holes of the discs. Thus, the misalignment of the slots is [...] "corrected" [...] by a rotation to the correct angle. For example, if the hole is 270°, the key is 180°, and if the hole is 240° (270° minus 30°), the key is 150° (180° with 30° notch) of the circle. In addition, there is a notch in the perimeter of each disc. A sidebar inside {{an opening in the}} lock cylinder around the discs, and an edge in the casing obstructs the movement of the cylinder beyond the 90°.|$|E
50|$|If a right {{triangle}} has two angles that equal 45° {{then the two}} sides are equidistant. The rafter is the hypotenuse and the legs or catheti of the triangle are the top wall plates of the structure. The side cut is located at the intersection of the given pitch column and the side cut of the hip/valley row. The regular hip/valley rafter runs at a 45° angle to the main roof and the unit of measurement is 16.97 inches of run. Regular hip/valley and jack rafters have different bevel angles within any given pitch and the angle decreases as the pitch increases.The side cut of the hip/valley rafter = (Tangent)(12) = side cut in inches. The side cuts in the rafter table are all in a base 12. The arc tan can be determined from any given pitch. Most power tools and angle measuring devises use 90° as 0° in construction. The <b>complementary</b> <b>angles</b> of the arc tan are used with tools like the speed square.|$|E
5000|$|Up to symmetries and {{parallel}} translation, the snub disphenoid has five types of simple (non-self-crossing) closed geodesics. These are paths {{on the surface}} of the polyhedron that avoid the vertices and locally look like a shortest path: they follow straight line segments across each face of the polyhedron that they intersect, and when they cross an edge of the polyhedron they make <b>complementary</b> <b>angles</b> on the two incident faces to the edge. Intuitively, one could stretch a rubber band around the polyhedron along this path and it would stay in place: there is no way to locally change the path and make it shorter. For example, one type of geodesic crosses the two opposite edges of the snub disphenoid at their midpoints (where the symmetry axis exits the polytope) at an angle of /3. A second type of geodesic passes near the intersection of the snub disphenoid with the plane that perpendicularly bisects the symmetry axis (the equator of the polyhedron), crossing the edges of eight triangles at angles that alternate between /2 and /6. Shifting a geodesic {{on the surface of}} the polyhedron by a small amount (small enough that the shift does not cause it to cross any vertices) preserves the property of being a geodesic and preserves its length, so both of these examples have shifted versions of the same type that are less symmetrically placed. The lengths of the five simple closed geodesics on a snub disphenoid with unit-length edges are ...|$|E
50|$|This tool uses a 0° reference.

The sum of the angles equals 90 degrees(22.5° +67.5°= 90°). It is obvious from a visual check that where the instruments displays 22.5° is not 22.5°. Many of the new slide miters and miter boxes display both angles. Some of the new calculators have a 0° and a 90° references to do angular calculations. This can create much confusion if the user does not understand this angular calibration.|$|R
