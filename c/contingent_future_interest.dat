40|$|Uniform {{perpetuity}} {{reform is}} on the march, and Oregon has joined the parade. On January 1, 1990, the Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities (Uniform Act) became effective in Oregon. Although promulgated only three years ago, the Uniform Act has been enacted in over {{twenty percent of the}} states and appears to be on its way toward enactment in several others. Prior to the adoption of the Uniform Act, Oregon followed the common-law Rule Against Perpetuities (common-law Rule). Noted for its unjust consequences, the common-law Rule disregards actual events and invalidates a <b>contingent</b> (nonvested) <b>future</b> <b>interest</b> merely on the grounds of what might happen. Regardless of what actually happens, an interest is invalid at common law if it is not certain to vest (or terminate) within twenty-one years after the death of a life in being at the creation of the interest. Oregon practitioners and their clients will appreciate the fact that the Uniform Act not only eliminates the unjust consequences of the common-law Rule but also eliminates wasteful perpetuity litigation. Most of all, perhaps, Oregon practitioners will appreciate the fact that the Act does not require them to learn a complicated new scheme of perpetuity law...|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{studies have}} found that a low {{interest}} rate environment accelerates firmsf investment and debt financing, leading to subsequent balance sheet problems in many countries in recent years. We examine the mechanism whereby firmfs debt financing and investment become more accelerated and the credit risk rises under a low interest rate environment {{from the perspective of a}} real options model. We find that firms tend to increase debt financing and investment not only under strong expectations of continued low interest rates but also when there are expectations of <b>future</b> <b>interest</b> rate increases, and such behavior causes higher credit risk. We also find that when <b>future</b> <b>interest</b> rate rises are expected, the investment decisions vary depending on how firms incorporate the possibility of <b>future</b> <b>interest</b> rises. Specifically, myopic firms make glast-minute investmentsh based on concerns over <b>future</b> <b>interest</b> rate hikes and this behavior increases their credit risk. In contrast, economically rational firms choose to decrease their investments, carefully considering the likelihood of <b>future</b> <b>interest</b> rate hikes.

According to the results, a large fraction of the variance of the unexpected returns (between 43 % and 67 %) can be attributed to term premiums, and therefore we should be careful in attributing movements in the forward curve exclusively to movements in the expected path of <b>future</b> <b>interest</b> rates. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{selective}} survey of new or recent methods to extract information about market expectations from asset prices for monetary policy purposes.

More recently, these methods have been refined to rely on implied forward exchange rates, so as to extract expected <b>future</b> time-paths of <b>interest</b> rates, exchange rates and inflatione rates. Very recently, methods have been designed to extract not only means but the whole (risk neutral) probability distribution of <b>future</b> <b>interest</b> rates and exchange rates from a set of option prices.
