In late July a breakout from the beachhead was attempted and the 1st Special Service Brigade moved through the Le Bois de Bavent, a large wooded area, as the Germans began to withdraw. Nevertheless, little progress was made, and, after a brief move which saw No. 6 Commando advance to Bavent, they went on the defensive again.|$|E
5|$|Augustine consecrated Justus as {{a bishop}} in 604, over a {{province}} including the Kentish town of Rochester. The historian Nicholas Brooks {{argues that the}} choice of Rochester was probably not {{because it had been}} a Roman-era bishopric, but rather because of its importance in the politics of the time. Although the town was small, with just one street, it was at the junction of Watling Street and the estuary of the Medway, and was thus a fortified town. Because Justus was probably not a monk (he was not <b>called</b> <b>that</b> by Bede), his cathedral clergy was very likely non-monastic too.|$|E

5|$|Mutiny of the Matoika is {{the common}} name for the events in July 1920 {{involving}} {{a large portion of}} the Olympic team of the United States while on board the U.S. Army transport ship , headed to Antwerp for the 1920 Summer Olympics. Princess Matoika was a last-minute substitute for another ship and, according to the athletes, did not have adequate accommodations or training facilities on board. Near the end of the voyage, the athletes published a list of grievances and demands and distributed copies of the document to the United States Secretary of War, the American Olympic Committee (AOC) members, and the press. The incident received wide coverage in American newspapers at the time and was still being discussed in the popular press years later. The event was not a mutiny in the traditional sense, but has been <b>called</b> <b>that</b> since the mid-1930s.|$|E
