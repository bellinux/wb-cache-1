Since every resistive element has a parasitic compo-nent, solutions on the <b>characteristic</b> <b>curves</b> are stable or unstable. In this paper, we show that the stabil-ity will be mainly changed at the bifurcation points such as limit point and branch point. Applying the curve tracing method, we can decide the unsta-ble regions on <b>characteristic</b> <b>curves</b> by the locations of bifurcation points. ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{salt water}} that is free of air bubbles or {{suspended}} sediment, sound travels at about [...] ( [...] at , 10°C and 3% salinity by one method). The speed of sound in seawater depends on pressure (hence depth), temperature (a change of [...] ~ [...] ), and salinity (a change of 1‰ ~ [...] ), and empirical equations have been derived to accurately calculate {{the speed of sound}} from these variables. Other factors affecting the speed of sound are minor. Since temperature decreases with depth while pressure and generally salinity increase, the profile of the speed of sound with depth generally shows a <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> which decreases to a minimum at a depth of several hundred meters, then increases again with increasing depth (right).

2500|$|In psychometrics, item {{response}} theory (IRT), {{also known}} as latent trait theory, strong true score theory, or modern mental test theory, is a paradigm for the design, analysis, and scoring of tests, questionnaires, and similar instruments measuring abilities, attitudes, or other variables. It is a theory of testing based {{on the relationship between}} individuals’ performances on a test item and the test takers’ levels of performance on an overall measure of the ability that item was designed to measure. Several different statistical models are used to represent both item and test taker characteristics. Unlike simpler alternatives for creating scales and evaluating questionnaire responses, it does not assume that each item is equally difficult. This distinguishes IRT from, for instance, the assumption in Likert scaling that [...] "All items are assumed to be replications of each other or in other words items are considered to be parallel instruments" [...] (p.197). By contrast, item response theory treats the difficulty of each item (the ICCs) as information to be incorporated in scaling items. ICC stands for item <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Suppose {{the initial}} {{operating}} point D (...) at some rpm N. On decreasing the flow- rate at same rpm along the <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> by partial {{closing of the}} valve, the pressure in the pipe increases which will be taken care by increase in input pressure at the compressor. Further increase in pressure till point P (surge point), compressor pressure will increase. Further moving towards left keeping rpm constant, pressure in pipe will increase but compressor pressure will decrease leading to back air-flow towards the compressor. Due to this back flow, pressure in pipe will decrease because this unequal pressure condition cannot stay {{for a long period}} of time. Though valve position is set for lower flow rate say point G but compressor will work according to normal stable operation point say E, so path E-F-P-G-E will be followed leading to breakdown of flow, hence pressure in the compressor falls further to point H (...) [...] This increase and decrease of pressure in pipe will occur repeatedly in pipe and compressor following the cycle E-F-P-G-H-E also known as the surge cycle.|$|E
