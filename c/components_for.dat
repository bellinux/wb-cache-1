40|$|Abstract-Although mesh-connected {{computers}} are used almost exclusively for low-level local image processing, {{they are also}} suitable for higher level image processing tasks. We illustrate this by presenting new optimal (in the 0 -notational sense) algorithms for computing several geometric properties of figures. For example, given a black/white picture stored one pixel per processing element in an n X n mesh-connected computer, we give 0 (n) time algorithms for determining the extreme points of the convex hull of each <b>component,</b> <b>for</b> deciding if the convex hull of each component contains pixels that are not members of the <b>component,</b> <b>for</b> deciding if two sets of processors are linearly separable, for deciding if each <b>component</b> is convex, <b>for</b> determining {{the distance to the}} nearest neighboring component of each <b>component,</b> <b>for</b> determining internal distances in each <b>component,</b> <b>for</b> counting and marking minimal internal paths in each <b>component,</b> <b>for</b> computing the external diameter of each <b>component,</b> <b>for</b> solving the largest empty circle problem, for determining internal diameters of components without holes, and for solving the all-points farthest point problem. Previous meshconnected computer algorithms for these problems were either nonexistent or had worst case times of 0 (n 2). Since any serial computer has a best case time of 0 (n 2) when processing an n X n image, our algorithms show that the mesh-connected computer provides significantly better solutions to these problems.

5|$|Silver is very {{important}} in electronics for conductors and electrodes on account of its high electrical conductivity even when tarnished. Bulk silver and silver foils were used to make vacuum tubes, and continue to be used today in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, circuits, and their <b>components.</b> <b>For</b> example, silver is used in high quality connectors for RF, VHF, and higher frequencies, particularly in tuned circuits such as cavity filters where conductors cannot be scaled by more than 6%.
