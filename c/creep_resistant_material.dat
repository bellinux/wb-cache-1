40|$|Many {{components}} in conventional {{and nuclear power}} plant, aero-engines, chemical plant etc., operate at temperatures which are high enough for creep to occur. These include steam pipes, pipe branches, gas and steam turbine blades, etc. The manufacture of such components may also require welds {{to be part of}} them. In most cases, only nominal operating conditions (i. e. pressure, temperatures, system load, etc.) are known and hence precise life predictions for these components are not possible. Also, the proportion of life consumed will vary from position to position within a component. Hence, non-destructive techniques are adopted to assist in making decisions on whether to repair, continue operating or replace certain components. One such approach is to test a small sample removed from the component to make small creep test specimens which can be tested to give information on the remaining creep life of the component. When such a small sample cannot be removed from the operating component, e. g. in the case of small components, the component can be taken out of operation in order to make small creep test specimens, the results from which can then be used to assist with making decisions regarding similar or future components.

For the application of these steels is essentially necessary to know the impact of different test atmospheres and temperatures on the crack growth rate. In the present work, the influence of atmosphere (air, vacuum, simulated live steam), proof-temperature, hold time, thermal exposure on the crack growth has been studied at temperatures between 500 and 600 °C. The influence of proof-temperature and atmosphere has been reflected on micrographs of fracture surface. SEM-micrographs of the principal crack and also optical micrographs coming from the cross sections perpendicular to the plane of a crack propagation (secondary cracks) show changes in the character of a crack propagation dependent of the loading cycle and temperature. By fatigue crack growth tests has been enhancement of crack growth due to the aggressive atmosphere (air) noted. The fatigue crack growth rates in air are at least one order of magnitude faster than those in vacuum (inert atmosphere).

A time integration algorithm for simultaneously solving the equations that govern heat conduction and thermoviscoelastic deformations of isotropic homogeneous materials is developed. The algorithm is then integrated to the proposed micromechanical model. A significant temperature generation due to the dissipation effect in the viscoelastic matrix was observed when the composite body is subjected to cyclic mechanical loadings. Heat conduction due to the dissipation of the energy cannot be ignored in predicting the factual temperature and deformation fields within the composite structure, subjected to cyclic loading for a long period.

The motion of a dance can be segmented into some motion primitives, and we define a Buyo-fu as a code that isassigned to each motion primitive. Since we have been making a Buyo-fu manually so far, there exists a problem thatmaking a Buyo-fu requires not only much cost but also an expert knowledge about the dance. In this report, we propose a method to segment human motion data into some motion primitives {{in order to make}} aBuyo-fu automatically. We consider that human motion data consist of a series of human postures and that a motionprimitive is a segment which consists of a series of human postures having similar characteristics to each other.

As a result, we have developed a clustering method for segmentation by using a modified self-organizingmap(SOM) that can treat a time-series of data.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} an attempt {{is made to}} make a step forward in the {{development}} of next a generation scanning electron lithography machine for sub 25 nm chip making. One of the challenges for such a system is to have sufficient beam-lets with enough current for parallel writing which requires a sufficiently bright electron source. Since the present day commercial electron source is unable to provide the necessary number of beamlets with enough current, an array of bright and stable electron sources such as Schottky emitters is needed. As the Schottky emitter is operated at 1800 K, this results in challenges pertaining to alignment between various electrodes and emitters, which is important for beam to beam uniformity and beam stability. This thesis focuses mainly on the study of creating an array of Schottky emitters and addresses the various requirements and issues associated with the design such as thermal loading, positional stability and manufacturability. For parallel electron beam lithography, an array of miniaturized Schottky emitters is proposed. The design of this miniaturized Schottky emitter unit is analyzed thermally in chapter 2 to determine the optimum power and the filament dimensions. A numerical thermal analysis in steady state condition has been done and the temperature of the tip has been determined for different currents and heating filament dimensions. The optimized solution from the model is used for the fabrication of a miniature Schottky emitter. Apart from the heat radiation from the tip, emission from 200 such emitters would generate the considerable thermal load of 200 W on the extractor. Chapter 3 describes a possible way of reducing the thermal load on the extractor: it is shown by simulation that the extractor can be operated and the heat load can be halved if the Schottky emitter is operated without suppressor electrode. Simulation results show that if the suppressor electrode is removed, the same field as for the standard configuration can be obtained at the tip apex at an extraction voltage of 2265 V instead of 5000 V. The estimated total emission without the suppressor electrode rises to 668 ?A in comparison to 500 ?A in the standard configuration. However the total heating power dissipating on the extractor would be 40 % lower than the standard configuration. The position of the Schottky emitter tip is not stable during its life time. The position stability of the Schottky emitter is an issue as any misalignment with respect to the extractor would result in a change of the virtual source position. An attempt to study the tip stability and its mechanism from a thermo-mechanical point of view is presented in chapter 4. It is concluded that the tip movement is determined by many factors such as thermal history/thermal cycle, stress present and non-symmetrical filament length. Because of a time dependent- stress relaxing creep, the drift rate goes down with time, therefore it is imperative to know the thermal history of the tip to predict its movement. A better <b>creep</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>material</b> such as W-Re alloy for the filament could minimize the effect of creep. However the best alternative is to have a design which can compensate for such drifts. To compensate for the drift in z direction, a possible actuating mechanism was proposed using RTV 566. Chapter 5 reports the preliminary feasibility study of the RTV 566 for its application as a "spring" for in-situ height adjustment in our proposed design for an array of Schottky emitters. Although RTV 566 shows very little hysteresis, it shows clear sign of viscoelastic behavior, rendering it unsuitable for the application. The effort for z actuating of individual tips is then discontinued for the future design process. Another challenge is to miniaturize the Schottky emitter to 1 mm diameter. The diameter of a conventional Schottky emitter unit is too large (17. 5 mm) to use in an array of emitters, which would consist of 200 emitters at a pitch of 1. 5 mm. Chapter 6 discusses a novel method of fabricating a miniaturized Schottky emitter of 1 mm diameter by Wire-Electro Discharge Machining (WEDM) of polycrystalline tungsten with very good dimensional control and reproducibility. Joule heating in vacuum shows good operational feasibility and temperature stability. Therefore this concept has been considered for the design of Schottky emitter array. Chapter 7 documents various concepts of the Schottky emitter array. This chapter also shows the feasibility based on the results from earlier chapters. After careful evaluation some of the requirements were modified and re-assessed. It is deduced that the design with position control and temperature control would be difficult to implement. A design with no individual temperature and position control is proposed which consists of a tungsten block with monocrystalline tips on it. This, however, would require a large piece of W(100) which is not easily available. Chapter 8 presents the concept of DC Joule heating for the crystallographic transformation to convert polycrystalline tungsten to W(100) for the fabrication of the Schottky emitters. A miniature Schottky emitter fabricated by Wire Electrical Discharge Machining (WEDM) was heated by a DC current and the crystallographic orientation was subsequently determined by electron diffraction. In chapter 9 the design concept was extended for the fabrication of a prototype multi-tip for parallel electron beam lithography using WEDM technique. An attempt is made to recrystallize the tips but the experiment could not be completed. The recrystallization of polycrystalline tungsten in DC Joule heating can open up possibilities of using it in other shape and sizes. However, all the above concepts possess challenges of ensuring a uniform tip radius, where the recipe may need tailoring. A concept of parallel etching is proposed. Combining the above knowledge, a design for a next generation Schottky emitter array is proposed in chapter 10. It consists of four basic units: a heating plate, emitter block consisting of 200 tips, electrodes system and several accessories. The important components included in this design are a simple heater which can be fixed to the emitter block, a water channel in the insulating periphery of the electrodes for the cooling of the electrodes, a piezo-electric stage and an alignment screw plate for the alignment of tips and electrodes. Since the alignment between the tips and electrodes is very critical, it is important to estimate the performance and reliability of such units. In chapter 11, a detailed analysis involving determination of temperature profiles across various electrodes and the resulting stress is carried out by two methods and for two different configurations. The thermal load is evaluated and the necessary cooling is calculated. It is concluded that the thermal load is within the limit if sufficient cooling is done. Although the calculated temperature on the electrodes would not be an issue, the displacement in x-y direction on the extractor/micro-lens could be an issue for the configuration with 4 kV extraction and lens voltage. For optimum a design lower voltage on the extractor and the microlens with fixed edges is proposed. Based on the above thermal evaluation, chapter 12 reports the simulation study of the change in the field at the tip apex and the shift in the position of the virtual source of the Schottky emitter for a given shift in the extractor plate by CPO 3 D ray tracing calculations. The effect of the lateral and axial shift of the extractor on the field at the tip is negligible. However, the shift in virtual source position in x,y and z direction could be an issue even for a micron displacement. Separate deflectors for each beamlet can be used to compensate the x, y displacement. The axial displacement can be compensated by the piezo-stage with relative ease. The above shift in the virtual source position reduces considerably for the suppressor-less configuration. When the extractor is operated at 1 kV, without suppressor, the shift is within the design constraint. Therefore a design without suppressor electrode and an extractor with 1 kV potential is the most preferred concept. Imaging Science & TechnologyApplied Science...|$|E

40|$|Despite recent {{progress}} {{in the development of}} SiC-SiC ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), their application in industrial gas turbines for distributed energy (DE) systems has been limited. The poor oxidation resistance of the non-oxide ceramics warrants the use of envrionmental barrier coatings (EBCs), which in turn lead to issues pertaining to life expectancy of the coatings. On the other hand, oxide/oxide CMCs are potential replacements, but their use has been limited until now due to the poor creep resistance at high temperatures, particularly above 1200 oC: the lack of a <b>creep</b> <b>resistant</b> matrix has been a major limiting factor.
