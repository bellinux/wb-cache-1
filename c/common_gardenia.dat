50|$|Atractocarpus fitzalanii grows as a woody shrub {{or small}} tree some 3 - 10 m in height. The trunk {{is covered by}} smooth grey bark. The large glossy dark green leaves are obovate to oval-shaped and range from 10 - 18 cm long by 3 - 5 cm wide. The {{yellowish}} veins and midrib are prominent on the leaf. The new growth is a bright lime green in colour. The small (2-2.5 cm or 1 inch) white fragrant flowers appear from September to November, occur singly and have five lanceolate petals around a tube. The round- or oval-shaped fruit is 3-4 cm in diameter and ripens in April to June. The fragrance of the flowers resmebles that of the <b>common</b> <b>gardenia,</b> and fruit can be eaten fresh.|$|E
50|$|Originally from China, the <b>common</b> <b>gardenia</b> (Gardenia jasminoides) is {{a widely}} grown garden plant and flower in {{frost-free}} climates worldwide. Several other species from the genus are also seen in horticulture. The genus Ixora contains plants cultivated in warmer-climate gardens; the most commonly grown species, Ixora coccinea, is frequently used for pretty red-flowering hedges. Mussaenda cultivars with enlarged, colored calyx lobes are shrubs with the aspect of Hydrangea; they are mainly cultivated in tropical Asia. The New Zealand native Coprosma repens is a commonly used plant for hedges. The South African Rothmannia globosa {{is seen as a}} specimen tree in horticulture. Nertera granadensis is a well-known house plant cultivated for its conspicuous orange berries. Other ornamental plants include Mitchella, Morinda, Pentas, and Rubia.|$|E
50|$|Guettarda speciosa, with <b>common</b> names beach <b>gardenia,</b> sea randa, or zebra wood, is {{a species}} of shrub in the family Rubiaceae found in coastal {{habitats}} in tropical areas around the Pacific Ocean, including the coastline of central and northern Queensland and Northern Territory in Australia, and Pacific Islands, including Micronesia, French Polynesia and Fiji, Malaysia and Indonesia and {{the east coast of}} Africa. It reaches 6 m in height, has fragrant white flowers, and large green prominently-veined leaves. It grows in sand above the high tide mark.|$|R
40|$|Thrips florum Schumtz is a <b>common</b> pest of <b>gardenia</b> (Gardenia jasminoides Ellis) {{flowers in}} Hawaii. Typically {{hundreds}} of thrips infest each flower, and their feeding and egg laying punctures {{result in a}} brown discoloration of the white petals. The life cycle and biology of this pest was studied on gardenia flowers to facilitate proper timing of control procedures. This is possibly the first report on the developmental biology of this species. In laboratory tests, the development period from egg to adult female required a minimum of 17 days at 20 °C and 11 days at 24 °C. Significant proportions of second instars, propupae and pupae were found off the flower and resting on the bottoms or sides of rearing containers. Difficulty in rearing insects led to the observation that adults could not tolerate even short exposures to low or moderate levels of relative humidity (RH). In controlled humidity tests, only 19 % of T. florum survived a 24 -hour exposure to 92. 5 % RH, whereas this level was tolerated by > 90 % of western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande). In field studies, the number of T. florum infesting gardenia blossoms in a 2 -acre gardenia planting typically exceeded 200 adults per flower. Removing all open gardenia blossoms from the field once per week was associated with large reductions in the thrips population and an elimination of noticeable damage to flower buds...|$|R
5000|$|It grows as a woody shrub {{or small}} tree and reaches 8 m (25 ft) tall. The trunk does not form buttresses {{but may be}} crooked, and is covered by smooth grey bark with {{horizontal}} markings and long lenticels. The new growth is hairy in plants found north of Coffs Harbour (30° S) [...] The large glossy dark green leaves are obovate to lanceolate and range from 8-20 cm (3-8 in) long by 2-4 cm wide, and arranged in whorls of 3-4 on the branches. The veins and midrib are prominent on the leaf. The small white fragrant flowers appear from June to November, occur in clusters {{of two or three}} and have five lanceolate petals around a tube. The orange oval-shaped fruit ripens in May to September, and bears 14-18 seeds in a pulp. The fragrance of the flowers has been likened to that of the <b>common</b> <b>gardenia.</b>|$|E
