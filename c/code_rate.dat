25|$|There is {{more than}} one upper bound on the {{achievable}} <b>code</b> <b>rate</b> of linear block codes for multiple phased-burst correction (MPBC). One such bound is constrained to a maximum correctable cyclic burst length within every subblock, or equivalently a constraint on the minimum error free length or gap within every phased-burst. This bound, when reduced to the special case of a bound for single burst correction, is the Abramson bound (a corollary of the Hamming bound for burst-error correction) when the cyclic burst length is less than half the block length.|$|E
2500|$|An {{ensemble}} has {{a maximum}} bit rate {{that can be}} carried, but this depends on which error protection level is used. However, all DAB multiplexes can carry a total of 864 [...] "capacity units". The number of capacity units, or CU, that a certain bit-rate level requires depends {{on the amount of}} error correction added to the transmission, as described above. In the UK, most services transmit using 'protection level three', which provides an average ECC <b>code</b> <b>rate</b> of approximately ½, equating to a maximum bit rate per multiplex of 1,184 kbit/s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The second-order <b>coding</b> <b>rate</b> for source-channel <b>codes</b> with m {{levels of}} unequal message {{protection}} (UMP) is derived. The second-order <b>coding</b> <b>rate</b> {{takes the form}} of an optimization problem which reduces to separate source-channel <b>coding</b> <b>rate</b> for m = 2. A procedure for solving the given optimization problem is proposed. The proposed procedure exploits the structure of the problem to reduce the optimization search space to one dimension. Numerical results for the BSC are obtained and it is shown, empirically, that the second-order <b>coding</b> <b>rate</b> of source-channel <b>codes</b> with m levels of UMP approaches the optimal joint source-channel <b>coding</b> <b>rate</b> as m grows.

2500|$|The old {{version of}} DAB uses {{punctured}} convolutional coding for its ECC. The coding scheme uses {{unequal error protection}} (UEP), which means that parts of the audio bit-stream that {{are more susceptible to}} errors causing audible disturbances are provided with more protection (i.e. a lower <b>code</b> <b>rate)</b> and vice versa. However, the UEP scheme used on DAB results in there being a grey area in between the user experiencing good reception quality and no reception at all, as opposed to the situation with most other wireless digital communication systems that have a sharp [...] "digital cliff", where the signal rapidly becomes unusable if the signal strength drops below a certain threshold. When DAB listeners receive a signal in this intermediate strength area they experience a [...] "burbling" [...] sound which interrupts the playback of the audio.|$|E

50|$|The <b>code</b> <b>rate</b> of a {{convolutional}} code is commonly modified via symbol puncturing. For example, a {{convolutional code}} with a 'mother' <b>code</b> <b>rate</b> n/k=1/2 may be punctured {{to a higher}} rate of, for example, 7/8 simply by not transmitting a portion of code symbols. The performance of a punctured convolutional code generally scales well {{with the amount of}} parity transmitted. The ability to perform economical soft decision decoding on convolutional codes, as well as the block length and <b>code</b> <b>rate</b> flexibility of convolutional codes, makes them very popular for digital communications.|$|E

For each subband, the source <b>coding</b> <b>rate</b> as well as the level of protection (quantified by the channel <b>coding</b> <b>rate)</b> are jointly chosen to minimize the total end-to-end mean-squared distortion suffered by the source. This allocation of source and channel <b>coding</b> <b>rates</b> is posed as a constrained optimization problem, and solved using a generalized bit allocation algorithm. The optimal choice of source and channel <b>coding</b> <b>rates</b> depends {{on the state of the}} physical channel.
