The complete mathematical analysis of CSMA networks with HSs is still an open problem, even for broadcast communication with a simple linear network topology. In this paper we address this challenge by introducing a MAC layer modeling methodology based on time- and space-domain Markov processes. Using this methodology we derive the closed-form solution for the steady-state performance in infinite one-dimensional (1 -D) CSMA networks with HSs. The analytical results are validated by simulation and establish that: 1) under the assumption of fixed frame duration, if the <b>conditional</b> channel <b>access</b> probability at each station exceeds a certain threshold, the CSMA system enters the status of "synchronized transmissions", where {{a large number of}} adjacent stations transmit in overlap and interfere each other resulting in null system goodput. 2) The maximum system goodput of CSMA broadcast communication increases with increased station density but becomes increasingly sensitive to the <b>conditional</b> channel <b>access</b> probability. In [25] we validate the analytical results gained in this paper by simulation of a multi-lane highway scenario, and provide quantitative guidance for congestion control algorithms in vehicular networks.

The Recording Industry Association of America, in particular, {{has been on the}} front lines of the fight against copyright infringement, which the industry calls [...] "piracy". The industry has had victories against some services, including a highly publicized case against the file-sharing company Napster, and some people have been prosecuted for sharing files in violation of copyright. The electronic age has seen an increase in the attempt to use software-based digital rights management tools to restrict the copying and use of digitally based works. Laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act have been enacted that use criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital rights management systems. Equivalent provisions, to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in EU for some time, and are being expanded in, for example, Article 6 and 7 the Copyright Directive. Other examples are Article 7 of the Software Directive of 1991 (91/250/EEC), and the <b>Conditional</b> <b>Access</b> Directive of 1998 (98/84/EEC). This can hinder legal uses, affecting public domain works, limitations and exceptions to copyright, or uses allowed by the copyright holder. Some copyleft licenses, like GNU GPL 3, are designed to counter that. Laws may permit circumvention under specific conditions like when it is necessary to achieve interoperability with the circumventor's program, or for accessibility reasons; however, distribution of circumvention tools or instructions may be illegal.|$|E

Among the results are that the decision of moderates (i. e. those with state-dependent induced preferences over the agenda) to seek access is independent of others' decisions, but this is not true of extremists (those who unequivocally favour one or other of the two alternatives); that although the policy preferences of the legislator coincide with those of the moderates, the legislator often sets the required contribution from moderates higher than that from extremists and, moreover, this is so despite the fact that extremists seeking access offer an argument to the legislator which, although informative, gives negligible payoff gains to the legislator; and, finally, that (expected) "bias in decision making typically exists and persists even when the size of extremist groups is negligible relative to that of the moderate group...|$|R

40|$|Dry-land legumes, well {{adapted to}} drought-prone areas, {{have largely been}} {{neglected}} in the past despite the good opportunities they offer for income growth and food (and nutritional) security for the poor. This study evaluated the adoption and impact of two farmer and market-preferred and disease-resistant pigeonpea varieties that were developed and promoted in semi-arid Tanzania. The new varieties were resistant to fusarium wilt, a fungal disease devastating the crop. However, farmers wanting to adopt new varieties did not adopt due to seed access constraints and under-developed seed delivery systems. Adoption of new varieties is therefore analyzed using an augmented double hurdle model that allows estimating variety adoption <b>conditional</b> on seed <b>access</b> thresholds accounting for the additional information on sample separation. The study identifies the crucial role of seed access (local supply), extension, education, participatory decision making, capital, and household assets in determining adoption. The social economic benefits of the technology and policies for improved seed access were further analyzed using the extended economic surplus method (DREAM model). Even under restrictive assumptions, overall discounted benefits {{were found to be}} quite attractive, indicating the need for additional efforts to scale-up the success story. Analysis of changes in research benefits from relaxing the seed access constraint showed that net gains would increase by up to 30 % if farmer access to improved seeds can be assured. Smallholder farmers are the major beneficiaries along with consumers and rural net-buyers who gain from productivity-induced lower market prices.

40|$|In recent years, {{the phenomenal}} {{technological}} developments {{in information technology}} have led {{to an increase in}} the capability to store and record personal data about customers and individuals. This has led to concerns that the personal data may be misused for a variety of purposes. In order to alleviate these concerns, a number of techniques have been recently proposed in order to perform data mining tasks that are privacy-preserving. Thus the field of privacy has seen rapid advances in recent years and in the data mining environment have led to increased concerns about privacy. In this thesis, we develop efficient, effective and realistic methods in the privacy-preserving data mining field focusing on three core techniques, namely access control, data anonymization and statistical disclosure control. In Part I, this thesis presents a model for privacy preserving access control which is based on a variety of purposes. Conditional purpose is applied along with allowed purpose and prohibited purpose in the model. It allows users to use some data for certain purposes with conditions. The structure of the <b>conditional</b> purpose-based <b>access</b> control model (CPBAC) is defined and investigated through a practical paradigm with access purpose and intended purpose. An algorithm is developed to achieve the compliance computation between access purposes and intended purposes. According to this model, more information from data providers can be extracted {{while at the same time}} assuring privacy that maximizes the usability of consumers’ data. This model extends traditional access control models to a further coverage of privacy preservation in the data mining environment. Its interior is a new structure for managing collected data in an effective and trustworthy way. This structure helps enterprises to circulate clear privacy promises and to collect and manage user preferences and consent. Finally, we inject this model with the conventional well known role-based access control (RBAC) model as RBAC is still the most popular approach towards access control to achieve database security and is available in many DBMS. The notion of applying these mechanisms to allow web sites to publish a privacy policy, and implement more nuanced management of usage information and other personal information, ultimately allows (legitimate) use of information. In Part II, this thesis presents a systematic clustering based k-anonymization technique to minimize the information loss and at the same time assure data quality. The proposed technique adopts a system to group similar data together and then anonymize each group individually. The structure of systematic clustering problem is defined and investigated through paradigm and properties. An algorithm of the proposed problem is developed and it is shown that the time complexity is in O(n 2 /k), where n is the total number of records containing individuals and their private information. Experimental results show that the proposed method attains a reasonable dominance with respect to both information loss and execution time. A way out is also shown to illustrate the usability of the algorithm for incremental datasets. Finally we extend the systematic-clustering approach to the l-diversity model that assumes that every group of indistinguishable records contains at least l distinct sensitive attribute values. The whole procedure consists of the two steps, namely a clustering step for k-anonymization and an l-diverse step. In Part III, this thesis presents two heuristic algorithms for microdata protection in Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC). The first heuristic microaggregation algorithm works by partitioning the microdata into clusters of at least k records in a systematic way and then replacing the records in each cluster with the centroid of the cluster which we refer to systematic microaggregation for SDC. The structure of the systematic microaggregation problem is defined and investigated and an algorithm of the proposed problem is developed. Experimental results show that the systematic microaggregation attains a reasonable dominance with respect to both information loss and execution time than the most popular heuristic algorithm called Maximum Distance to Average Vector (MDAV). Finally it has shown that the systematic microaggregation is highly scalable. The second heuristic algorithm, called pairwise-systematic (P-S) microaggregation easily captures extreme values in the dataset and works by adopting simultaneously two distant groups at a time with the corresponding similar records together in a systematic way. Extensive experimental studies are conducted to show the efficiency and the effectiveness of the algorithm. The performance of the P-S algorithm is compared against the most recent microaggregation methods. Experimental results show that the P-S algorithm incurs significantly less information loss compared to the latest microaggregation methods for all of the test situations. Finally we propose a new microaggregation method where centroid is considered as median. The new method guarantees that the microaggregated data and the original data are similar by using a statistical test. ...|$|R
