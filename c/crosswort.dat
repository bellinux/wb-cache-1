It has whorls of narrow, aromatic leaves and terminal clusters of tubular pink flowers. Phuopsis stylosa is native to the Caucasus and Iran, and is widely grown elsewhere as a garden plant.|$|E
5000|$|Listed as Wreattinge in the 10th {{century and}} Waratinge in the Domesday Book, the village's name means [...] "place where <b>crosswort</b> or {{hellebore}} grows".|$|E

50|$|Cruciata laevipes is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the Rubiaceae family. It {{is commonly known as}} <b>crosswort,</b> smooth bedstraw or Luc na croise in Gaelic. The Latin epithet laevipes refers to the smooth stalk.|$|E
5000|$|Cruciata laevipes {{is little}} used in herbal {{medicine}} today, {{but it was}} once recommended as a remedy for rupture, rheumatism and dropsy. [...] Bald's Leechbook recommended <b>crosswort</b> as a cure for headaches. In Romanian folklore, it is called sânziana and it {{is linked to the}} Sânziene fairies and their festival on June 24.|$|E
50|$|Ħalfa Rock (Maltese: Il-Ġebla tal-Ħalfa or Il-Blata tal-Ħalfa) is {{a deserted}} small islet and {{limestone}} rock on the south-east {{coast of the}} island of Gozo in the Maltese archipelago. The small islet is typified by a small maritime labiate garrigue environment, with germander and prasium shrubs, with the occurrence of the endemic Maltese Pyramidal Orchid as well as endemic coastal communities based on the Maltese Sea-Lavender and the sub-endemic Maltese <b>Crosswort.</b>|$|E
5000|$|One {{cure for}} {{headache}} was to bind a stalk of <b>crosswort</b> {{to the head}} with a red kerchief. Chilblains were treated with a mix of eggs, wine, and fennel root. Agrimony was cited as a cure for male impotence - when boiled in milk, it could excite a man who was [...] "insufficiently virile;" [...] when boiled in Welsh beer it would have the opposite effect. The remedy for shingles comprised a potion using the bark of 15 trees: aspen, apple, maple, elder, willow, sallow, myrtle, wych-elm, oak, blackthorn, birch, olive, dogwood, ash, and quickbeam.|$|E
50|$|A {{distinct}} {{habitat is}} provided by the interface between saltmarsh and dune and supports reflexed saltmarsh grass (Puccinellia distans), hard-grass (Parapholis strigosa) and sea-milkwort (Glaux maritima). The dune ridge supports marram (Ammophila arenaria), and lesser meadow-rue (Thalictrum minus) with bloody crane's-bill (Geranium sanguineum) and hound's-tongue (Cynoglossum officinale). Bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) is found on the lower landward slopes. The site extends to areas of shorter turf, which supports cowslip (Primula veris), early-purple orchid (Orchis mascula), violets (Viola spp.), and yarrow (Achillea millefolium), with widespread early forget-me-not (Myosotis ramosissima), common cornsalad (Valerianella locusta), hairy tare (Vicia hirsuta), and <b>crosswort</b> (Galium cruciata).|$|E
50|$|The area of 'wild-wood' {{beyond the}} ha-ha, with its 'sheets of bluebells', the wood rushes, wood sorrel, dog's mercury, snowdrops, celandine, broad buckler, lady and male-shield ferns, helleborine orchids {{and other species}} typical of long {{established}} woodlands, abruptly ends at the 'march' (estate boundary) indicated by a large earth bund and a coppiced boundary beech. The 1858 OS shows the wood as confined {{to the area of}} the ha-ha, however by 1897 the OS shows woodland as far up as the march. The Lambroughton woods beyond (until recently the property of the Montgomery / Southannan Estate) are not shown on the older maps including the 1911 OS, they are shown in the 1960 OS map as a pine plantations amongst what was scrub or partial woodland cover containing elder, gean, ash, etc. Before this time the area above the river was not even fenced off at the top where it becomes 'level' with the field.Although giant hogweed is taking hold along the Annick (2006), however the riparian (water side) flora is still indicative of long established and undisturbed habitats. The rare <b>crosswort,</b> (a relative of the goosegrass or cleavers) is found nearby. The river contains, amongst others, brown trout, sea trout, salmon, eels, minnows, and stickleback.
