500|$|The team's most fertile {{period of}} {{technical}} innovation {{came in the}} 1970s and 1980s when Gordon Murray became technical director. During 1976, the team introduced [...] "carbon-carbon brakes" [...] to Formula One, which promised reduced [...] "unsprung weight" [...] and better stopping performance due to carbon's greater coefficient of friction. The initial versions used carbon-carbon composite brake pads and a steel disc faced with carbon [...] "pucks". The technology was not reliable at first; in 1976, Carlos Pace crashed at [...] at the Österreichring circuit after heat build-up in the brakes boiled the brake fluid, leaving him with no way of stopping the car. By 1979, Brabham had developed an effective carbon-carbon braking system, combining structural carbon discs with <b>carbon</b> <b>brake</b> pads. By the late 1980s, carbon brakes were used by all competitors in almost all top level motor sports.|$|E

50|$|Gordon Murray {{attempted}} to utilise <b>carbon</b> <b>brakes</b> for the F1, but found the technology not mature enough at the time; {{with one of}} the major culprits being that of a proportional relationship between brake disc temperature and friction—i.e. stopping power—thus resulting in relatively poor brake performance without an initial warm-up of the <b>brakes</b> before use.Since <b>carbon</b> <b>brakes</b> have a more simplified application envelope in pure racing environments, this allows for the racing edition of the machine, the F1 GTR, to feature ceramic <b>carbon</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Brake wear is not {{a problem}} during a race in Monaco. Instead the low speeds mean the issue is keeping the brakes up to working {{temperature}}. The only heavy braking points are at the chicane after the tunnel, {{and to a lesser extent}} into the Sainte-Dévote and Mirabeau corners. With a lack of temperature brake bite becomes a problem, as the surface of the <b>carbon</b> <b>brake</b> disc becomes smooth as glass, reducing friction between the pads and the disk, hence lessening braking power [...] To combat this, in 2006 Juan Pablo Montoya adopted discs with radial grooves that increased the bite rate between disk and pads, increasing the average temperature of the brakes.|$|E

It was featured on Top Gear in series 11 by Jeremy Clarkson, and due to the car having so much torque, one of the car's tires blew out during a powerslide after prolonged aggressive driving with its traction control off. It can achieve 0 to 60 mph in around 5.0 seconds, and a top speed in the region of 296 km/h.

40|$|The <b>carbon</b> <b>brake</b> discs were {{manufactured}} by densification the carbon fiber preform using PG-CVI technology with Propene as a carbon precursor gas and Nitrogen as a carrier gas. The densities of <b>carbon</b> <b>brake</b> discs were tested at different densification time. The {{results indicate that}} the densification rate is more rapid before 100 hrs than after 200 hrs. The CT-scanning image and the SEM technology were used to observe the inner subtle structure. CT-images show the density distribution in the <b>carbon</b> <b>brake</b> disc clearly. The <b>carbon</b> <b>brake</b> disk made by PG-CVI is not very uniform. There is a density gradient in the bulk. The high-density part in the <b>carbon</b> <b>brake</b> is really located in the friction surface, especially in the part of inner circle.

40|$|This work investigates and {{provides}} a methodology that enables better prediction of brake performance. Aircraft brake performance depends on the tribological properties of the friction couple used in the brake design. The behaviour of this couple combines both surface and bulk characteristics of the material. The increase in aircraft performance requirements {{has led to the}} development of new brake designs and new friction materials. The development of brakes for large commercial aircraft has stabilised to that of a carbon-carbon composite multi-disk brake design. The results of this investigation established a relationship between mean mass loading and the mean friction radius of the brake. This relationship provides a statistically good description of the results and will provide the brake performance engineer with a useful tool. In addition, the variance within the results of the 100 Normals aircraft qualification programme was also studied. In this case the relationship is not particularly good at describing the results. A case study has been included to promote further understanding of the developed methodology and to illustrate some of the trade-offs required when designing a <b>carbon</b> <b>brake.</b> The design of a multi-disk brake is a complex engineering task that requires many specialist engineering disciplines such as structural analysis and dynamic analysis etc. The wider context of aircraft braking is even broader and requires not only mechanical engineering skills but also electronic and software engineering. This research addresses all aspects of system integration {{and provides}} a framework of understanding on the interaction and dependencies of the various components...|$|E
