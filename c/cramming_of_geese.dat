The research was carried out in the flock <b>of</b> the Zatorska <b>geese,</b> belonging to the FAO registered genetic resources of poultry. Seven hundred sixty-one eggs from pedigree bred geese in their first to fourth reproduction seasons were included in the analysis. Average egg shape index was 68. 8 %, average shell surface area was 140. 6 cm 2. Egg weight <b>of</b> <b>geese</b> in different age was 165 g.

40|$|Interferon γ {{receptor}} 1 (IFNGR 1) and IFNGR 2 are two {{cell membrane}} molecules belonging to class II cytokines, which play {{important roles in}} the IFN-mediated antiviral signaling pathway. Here, goose IFNGR 1 and IFNGR 2 were cloned and identified for the first time. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that relatively high levels <b>of</b> <b>goose</b> IFNγ mRNA transcripts were detected in immune tissues, including the harderian gland, cecal tonsil, cecum, and thymus. Relatively high expression levels of both IFNGR 1 and IFNGR 2 were detected in the cecal tonsil, which implicated an important role of IFNγ in the secondary immune system <b>of</b> <b>geese.</b> No specific correlation between IFNγ, IFNGR 1, and IFNGR 2 expression levels was observed in the same tissues <b>of</b> healthy <b>geese.</b> IFNγ and its cognate receptors showed different expression profiles, although they appeared to maintain a relatively balanced state. Furthermore, the agonist R 848 led to the upregulation <b>of</b> <b>goose</b> IFNγ but {{did not affect the}} expression <b>of</b> <b>goose</b> IFNGR 1 or IFNGR 2. In summary, trends in expression <b>of</b> <b>goose</b> IFNγ and its cognate receptors showed tissue specificity, as well as an age-related dependency. These findings may help us to better understand the age-related susceptibility to pathogens in birds...|$|R
40|$|The fast {{real-time}} application {{message is}} an object-oriented substation event—GOOSE (Generic Object Oriented Substation Event).

This paper will make a systematic analysis <b>of</b> <b>GOOSE.</b> At first, it will provide {{a detailed analysis of}} the transmission mechanism and process <b>of</b> <b>GOOSE</b> message. As certain practical operability lacks the actual application of the multicast filtering method which is applied to GOOSE message based on IEC 61850 standard, this paper will summarize three message filtering methods, compare the advantages and disadvantages in topological networks of different kinds in accordance with the instantaneity <b>of</b> <b>GOOSE</b> intelligent substation communication network and draw a conclusion that the independent configuration scheme <b>of</b> <b>GOOSE</b> and SV can adapt to the requirement of times, so as to provide theoretical references for the selection of practical intelligent substation communication network in the future...|$|R
