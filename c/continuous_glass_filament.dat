40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a proactive product stewardship program for glass fibers. That effort included epidemiological studies of workers, establishment of stringent workplace exposure limits, liaison with customers on safe use of products and, most importantly, a research program {{to evaluate the}} safety of existing glass fiber products and guide development of new even safer products. Chronic inhalation exposure bioassays were conducted with rodents and hamsters. Amosite and crocidolite asbestos produced respiratory tract cancers as did exposure to “biopersistent” synthetic vitreous fibers. “less biopersistent” glass fibers did not cause respiratory tract cancers. Corollary studies demonstrated the role of slow fiber dissolution rates and biopersistence in cancer induction. These results guided development of safer glass fiber products and {{have been used in}} Europe to regulate fibers and by IARC and NTP in classifying fibers. IARC concluded special purpose fibers and refractory ceramic fibers are “possibly carcinogenic to humans” and insulation glass wool, <b>continuous</b> <b>glass</b> <b>filament,</b> rock wool and slag wool are “not classifiable as to their carcinogenicity to human. ” The NTP’s 12 th report on carcinogens lists “Certain Glass Wool Fibers (Inhalable) ” as “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. ” “Certain” in the descriptor refers to “biopersistent” glass fibers and excludes “less biopersistent” glass fibers...|$|E
40|$|Man-made {{vitreous}} fibre (MMVF) is {{a generic}} name {{used to describe}} an inorganic fibrous material manufactured primarily from glass, rock, minerals, slag and processed inorganic oxides. The MMVFs produced are non-crystalline (glassy, vitreous, amorphous). Other names for MMVFs include manufactured vitreous fibres, man-made mineral fibres (MMMF), machine-made mineral fibres and synthetic vitreous fibres. <b>Continuous</b> <b>glass</b> <b>filament</b> is sometimes {{also referred to as}} ‘glass textile fibre’. The term ‘mineral wool ’ has been used in the USA to describe only rock (stone) wool and slag wool. In Europe, ‘mineral wool ’ also includes glass wool. In this monograph, the terms rock (stone) wool, slag wool and glass wool are used rather than mineral wool, whenever possible. Man-made vitreous fibres are manufactured by a variety of processes based on the attenuation of a thin stream of molten inorganic oxides at high temperatures. All commercially important MMVFs are silica-based and contain various amounts of other inorganic oxides. The non-silica components typically include, but are not limited to, oxides of alkaline earths, alkalis, aluminium, boron, iron and zirconium. These additional oxides may be constituents of the raw materials used to make the fibres, or they may be added to enhance the manufacturing process or the product performance. Depending on the process of fibre formation, MMVFs are produced either as wool, which is a mass of tangled, discontinuous fibres of variable lengths and diameters, or as filaments, which are continuous fibres (of indeterminate length) with diameters having ranges that are more uniform and typically thicker than those of wool. (a) Categorization The previous IARC Monographs on man-made mineral fibres (IARC, 1988) grouped fibres into five categories based loosely on raw materials, production process and/or product application. These categories were: glass filament, glass wool, rock wool, slag wool and ceramic fibres. To reflect developments in the industry, the categories have been expanded an...|$|E

A patch test was performed on 43 volunteers for the follow-ings: glass wool for non-residential use with and without a urea-modified phenolic resin binder, that for residential use with and without the binder, and <b>continuous</b> <b>glass</b> <b>filaments</b> with diameters of 4, 7, 9, and 13 µm. Materials were applied to an upper arm of each volunteer for 24 h. The skin was observed at 1 and 24 h after the removal. At 1 h after removal, slight erythema was observed on the skin of a woman after the exposure to glass wool for residential use without the binder. Erythema was observed on the skin of another woman at 1 h after a 24 -h exposure to glass wool for non-residential use without the binder. There were no reactions at 24 h after the removal. The low reactions in the patch test suggested that the irritability caused by glass wool, irrespective of a resin component, could be induced mechanically, and that the irritability caused by <b>continuous</b> <b>glass</b> fila-ments with resin could be slight and either mechanical or chemical...|$|R
5|$|The modern {{method for}} {{producing}} glass wool is {{the invention of}} Games Slayter working at the Owens-Illinois Glass Co. (Toledo, Ohio). He first applied for a patent for a new process to make glass wool in 1933. The first commercial production of glass fiber was in 1936. In 1938 Owens-Illinois Glass Company and Corning Glass Works joined to form the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation.

40|$|The BREF {{entitled}} ‘Manufacture of Glass’ forms part of {{a series}} presenting the results of an exchange of information between EU Member States, the industries concerned, non-governmental organisations promoting environmental protection, and the Commission, to draw up, review, and where necessary, update BAT reference documents as required by Article 13 (1) of the Directive. This document is published by the European Commission pursuant to Article 13 (6) of the Directive. This BREF for the glass manufacturing industry covers the following activities specified in Annex I to Directive 2010 / 75 /EU, namely: •	activity 3. 3 : Manufacture of glass including glass fibre with a melting capacity exceeding 20 tonnes per day •	activity 3. 4 : Melting mineral substances including the production of mineral fibres with a melting capacity exceeding 20 tonnes per day. The document also covers non-melting activities and downstream processes that may be directly associated to these activities and carried out on the same site. Important issues for the implementation of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU in the manufacturing of glass are the reduction of emissions to air; efficient usage of energy and raw materials; minimisation, recovery and recycling of process residues; as well as an effective implementation of environmental and energy management systems. The BREF document contains eight chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 provide general information on the glass manufacturing industry and on the industrial processes and techniques used within this sector. Chapter 3 provides data and information concerning the environmental performance of installations in terms of current emissions, consumptions of raw materials, water and energy, generation of waste. Chapter 4 describes the techniques to prevent or reduce the environmental impact of installations in this sector. In Chapter 5 the BAT conclusions, as defined in Article 3 (12) of the Directive, are presented for the eight sectors of the glass industry: container <b>glass,</b> flat <b>glass,</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> <b>glass</b> fibre, domestic glass, special glass, mineral wool, high temperature insulation wool, frits.

40|$|In {{the study}} of hybrid fibre cement {{composites}} containing continuous polypropylene fibres and glass fibres, {{it is important to}} know the fracture behaviour of the glass fibre strand in order to minimise the discrepancies between experiment and theory. A new technique of light transmission through the glass fibres has been developed in order to obtain independent information about the failure of individual <b>glass</b> <b>filaments</b> within a strand. The technique gave quantitative results showing that in the hybrid composite, about 80 % of the <b>glass</b> <b>filaments</b> were broken somewhere in the strands before the maximum stress in the composite was reached. This was in contrast to the composite reinforced with glass fibres alone where only about 30 % of the filaments were fractured before the ultimate stress.

40|$|The {{presence}} of hollow glass fibers in laminates used in today's printed circuit boards, chip carrier substrates, and plastic {{ball grid arrays}} can {{have a significant impact}} on reliability. In the manufacture of laminates used for the electronic industry, glass fibers are used for reinforcement. Laminates are composed of several plies of glass fabrics encapsulated with a polymeric resin. The most common fabric fiber material used today in laminate manufacture is E-glass, a <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> <b>glass</b> yarn with a chemical composition by weight of mostly SiO 2, but also containing various amounts of CaO, Al 2 O 3 and other materials. Advantages of E-glass lie in its high tensile strength, water resistance, bond stability with resins, and relatively low cost. The dielectric constant (6. 3 at 23 oC and 1 MHz) is high, but acceptable for most low frequency applications. The manufacture of glass fiber begins with the dry mixing of silicas, limestone, clay, and boric acid in appropriate proportions. In the direct-melt process, the mixture is melted in a refractory furnace at temperatures between 2600 and 2800 oF and fed directly into bushings, which are platinum alloy plates with nozzles. Alternatively, the melt can be formed into marbles, cooled to room temperature and stored for future use. Additional information about this process is supplied by Loewenstein [1983]. A homogeneous melt composition with negligible impurities is necessary for the successful manufactur...|$|R
40|$|Consideration of {{the human}} {{epidemiology}} of diseases arising from exposure to naturally occurring and man-made mineral fibers encompasses the several forms of asbestos (chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, anthophyllite, tremolite-actinolite), other naturally occurring silicates (talc, sepiolite, erionite, attapulgite, vermiculite, and wollastonite), and man-made mineral fibers (<b>glass</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>filament,</b> glass/rock/ slag insulation wools, ceramic and other refractory fibers, and glass microfibers). The diseases arising from exposures {{to some of these}} fibers include pleural thickening (plaques, diffuse pleural thickening, and calcification), pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancers, mesothelioma of the pleura and peritoneum, and other cancers). Risk factors important in assessing these diseases include assessment of latency, duration of exposure, cumulative exposure, fiber origin and characteristics (length and diameter), other possible confounding occupational or environmental exposures, and smoking. Methodological issues commonly presenting problems in evaluation of these data include assessment of the adequacy of environmental exposures, particularly in regard to fiber identification, distribution, and concentration over the duration of exposure, and the adequacy of study design to detect health effects (disease frequency, latency, and cohort size). Research priorities include further assessment and standardization of pleural thickening relative to fiber exposure, uniform mesothelioma surveillance, further epidemiological assessment of certain silicate and man-made mineral fiber cohorts with emphasis given to assessment of tremolite and small diameter glass and ceramic fibers. Further assessment of possible health risks of the general public should await improved definition of relevant fiber exposure in ambient air...|$|R

40|$|Worldwide, a {{great deal}} of {{research}} is currently being conducted concerning the use of fiber reinforced plastic wraps, laminates and sheets in the repair and strengthening of reinforced concrete members. Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) application is a very effective way to repair and strengthen structures that have become structurally weak over their life span. FRP repair systems provide an economically viable alternative to traditional repair systems and materials. Experimental investigations on the flexural and shear behavior of RC beams strengthened using <b>continuous</b> <b>glass</b> fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) sheets are carried out. Externally reinforced concrete beams with epoxy-bonded GFRP sheets were tested to failure using a symmetrical two point concentrated static loading system.
