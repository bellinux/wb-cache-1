40|$|Graduation date: 1986 A new carbohydrate-phenol based {{resorcinol}} resin (CPR resin) was synthesized by end capping a known carbohydrate-phenol based resole with resorcinol under {{basic reaction}} conditions. Synthetic parameters, such as duration of cook, pH, {{and the amount}} of resorcinol and formaldehyde were varied to produce resins with molecular weights (Mw) ranging from 1500 to 8000. These resins were tested for suitability as fast curing thermosetting adhesives to bond high moisture content veneers and as a <b>cold-setting</b> <b>adhesive</b> for producing glu-lam. The resin formulation which produced the best wood failure results was made with a glucose: urea: phenol: formaldehyde: resorcinol mole ratio of 1 : 0. 75 : 1 : 2. 0 : 1. 3. When this resin (Mw 4776) was combined with liquid formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, and walnut shell flour it exhibited a viscosity of 12, 000 centipoise and a gel time of 35 minutes at room temperature. This adhesive was able to bond 18...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{effort was}} directed towards {{the development of}} a novel <b>cold-setting</b> <b>adhesive</b> for the manufacture of laminated veneer lumber, LVL. The adhesives studied were isocyanate-reactive polyurethanes that cure at room temperature and bond to high moisture content veneer (12 %). The elimination of hot-pressing and the reduction in veneer drying is expected to provide substantial energy savings and decreases in VOC emissions. Furthermore, the use of higher moisture content veneer was expected to reduce or eliminate the tendency for veneer over drying, and the related reduction in wood surface energy. The effort produced a novel emulsion polymer isocyanate (EPI) adhesive that performed better than the standard phenol-formaldehyde adhesive. This performance comparison/evaluation suggested that the new adhesive could perhaps meet the original project goals, stated above. However, this effort was not translated into technological practice, nor evaluated on a larger pilot scale, because the participating companies experienced personnel changes that altered outlook for this technology...|$|E
40|$|The normal <b>cold-setting</b> <b>adhesive</b> require long {{clamping}} time from gluing to processing. It will disturb the production flow. To improve that, {{this study used}} the phenol/ resorcinol/ formaldehyde (PRF) 、 m-hydroxyaniline/phenol/ formaldehyde (MHA-PF) 、 resorcinol/formaldehyde resin (RF) prepared in laboratory, and mixed with flours of bark and their extractive of 1 ﹪ NaOH. This study investigated if the Honeymoon adhesives were acceptable in this applications. The main results are summerized as follows: 1. Resin mixed with extractive of 1 ﹪ NaOH made from barks better than that mixed with untreated flours. The mixed ratio extractive in relation {{to those of the}} barks averaged 50 ﹪ the strength were not inferior to resin without filler. extractive contained mostly the tannins and alkalines, which speed the glue setting. 2. What with component A was slow- reacting resin with a hardener, what with component B was fast-reacting resin, and speed the adhesive setting. The A and may be PRF, and improved the strength of MHA-PF. 3. The best of laminating factors was the same as normal adhesives. The water-resistant strength made by the {{clamping time}} for 2 hrs, would meet the requierments of the CNS. Although they may have the clamping time for 8 hrs, the strength was not inferior that time for 24 hrs. 4. Most of the properties of the would meet the requirements of the CNS 11031. The strength glulams made by MHA-PF and clamping time for 24 hrs was the The properties of glulams cured by the clamping time for 8 hrs lower than that time for 24 hrs. Among various species 、 numbers, the result had no obvious concern, because the sp. gr. teak was higher than cryptomeria...|$|E

Only less para-formaldehyde was added as hardener of adhesives. Both of them showed a rival tensile strength with tannin-resorcinol-formaldehyde adhesive. However they exhibited lower wood failure. The proportion of formaldehyde of the two are drastically decreased...|$|R

S standardnimi metodami smo ugotavljali strižno trdnost preskušancev (SIST EN 392), delaminacijo lepilnih spojev (SIST EN 291), modul elastičnosti in upogibno trdnost (SIST EN 310), gostoto (SIST EN 323) in vlažnost (SIST EN 322). Preskušali smo 5 lesnih vrst: navadno smreko (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), duglazijo (Pseudotsuga menziessii Franco), topol (Populus ssp.), brezo (Betula pendula) in jelšo (Alnus glutinosa Gaertn.), termično modificiranih s tehnologijo Plato. Za primerjavo smo pri navadni smreki preskušali tudi nemodificirane preskušance (NS), pa modificirane samo do prve, hidrotermične stopnje (HTNS). Preskušance za ugotavljanje kakovosti lepljenja smo lepili s 3 vrstami lepil: melamin-urea-formaldehidnim lepilom (MUF), fenol-resorcinol-formaldehidnim lepilom (PRF) in poliuretanskim lepilom (PUR). Ugotovili smo, da je bila kakovost lepljenja Plato lesa odvisna od uporabljene lesne vrste in predvsem vrste lepila. Trdnost lepilnega spoja je bila najnižja pri preskušancih lepljenih s PRF lepilom, nekoliko višja pri preskušancih lepljenih z MUF lepilom in najvišja pri preskušancih lepljenih s PUR lepilom. Ugotovili smo tudi, da ima Plato les manjšo upogibno trdnost v primerjavi z nemodificiranim lesom. Ravnovesna vlažnost Plato lesa v standardni klimi pa je približno dvakrat nižja od vlažnosti nemodificiranega lesa. Thesis {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} heat treatment by Plato process on bonding performance. Influence of heat treatment on some mechanical and physical properties was also examined. Several testing methods were carried out according to standard procedure: the shear strength of Plato wood (SIST EN 392), delaminations of glue lines (SIST EN 291), modulus of elasticity and bending strength (SIST EN 310), density (SIST EN 323) and moisture content of Plato wood (SIST EN 322). 5 wooden species were tested: Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst., Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziessii Franco), poplar (Populus ssp.), birch (Betula pendula Roth.) and alder (Alnus glutinosa Gaertn.) treated by Plato process. Untreated Norway spruce, so as treated Norway spruce were tested for comparisonthe last one only to the first stage (hydro-thermolised stage, HTNS). Test pieces were bonded with 3 structural <b>cold-setting</b> <b>adhesive</b> systems: melamine-urea-formaldehyde adhesive (MUF), phenol-resorcinol-formaldehyde adhesive (PRF), and polyurethane adhesive (PUR). It was {{found out that the}} bonding performance depends on wood species, and especially on the adhesive used. The results show the best bonding performance of the PUR, worse of the MUF, and the last of the PRF adhesive. It was also found out that the bending strength of Plato wood was decreased compared to untreated wood. Equilibrium moisture content of Plato wood in standard climate was about 50 % smaller than the adequate untreated wood...|$|E
