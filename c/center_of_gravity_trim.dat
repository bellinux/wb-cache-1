40|$|Difficulty in {{preventing}} rollover accidents of marine containers derives from various load conditions of cargoes inside the containers. Heavier cargoes are {{widely regarded as}} presenting greater danger of rollover accidents. However, this presupposition is severely misleading because lighter cargoes having a higher <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> such as machinery with an upper mass can also cause rollover accidents. Rollover accidents are explainable fundamentally as follows. The <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>of</b> a truck loading a marine container conflicts with the centrifugal force in cornering. A truck is unstable, causing a rollover accident when the moment originating from the centrifugal force exceeds that originating from the force <b>of</b> <b>gravity.</b> Such a truck might cause a rollover accident at a lower driving speed when the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> is positioned higher. The question is therefore {{how to find the}} <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>of</b> trucks with marine containers. Conditions of cargoes inside the containers differ greatly. Moreover, it is practically impossible to calculate those conditions by measuring all cargoes piece-by-piece in a container unless the time and cost to do so are unlimited. Without knowing what is inside a container, {{there is no way to}} detect the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> after a truck starts moving. An important invention by the second author of this paper was produced to solve that difficulty. Detection of the Three Dimensional <b>Center</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gravity</b> (D 3 DCG) can ascertain the position <b>of</b> the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> while trucks are moving. Soon after starting to move, vertical and rolling motions are measured onboard the trucks in half a minute. Then D 3 DCG is activated, instantly assessing the position <b>of</b> the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity.</b> D 3 DCG assumes that the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> causes unique motions depending on its position on the truck. Therefore there is no need to know what is inside the container. This paper first demonstrated the precision of D 3 DCG running an experiment by which a truck scale model was used. It was driven by remote control. Results of positions <b>of</b> the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> delivered from D 3 DCG were compared to those obtained using ordinary piece-by-piece calculations. Secondly, this paper assessed examples of D 3 DCG installed on an actual truck loading real marine containers. Results proved that D 3 DCG is valuable for real-time detection <b>of</b> the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> when driving. This achievement will greatly contribute to the prevention of rollover accidents...|$|R

40|$|The {{identification}} <b>of</b> the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> {{is crucial}} in determining the behavior and performance of the vehicle, which incorporates handling characteristics and rollover assessment. Conventional methods for locating the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> are either based on labor intensive and subjective static measurements, or enable active road-handling control strategies that are designed for worst case scenarios. Despite {{the large number of}} methods that already exist for locating the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> in vehicles, the use of operational data facilely available from measurements, presents a novel approach. This work focused on a near real-time method for identifying the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>of</b> a ground vehicle based solely on a kinematic approach and requires only a few dynamic measurements. ^ A theoretical foundation of the method was developed and derived from the translational and rotational aspects of a simplified half-car model. By replacing the restoring forces with the equivalent inertial forces in the analytical model, an expression for the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> was established, which does not explicitly depend on uncertain vehicle parameters. The final development stage of the method averages the extracted pitch motion of the vehicle by evaluating only the acceleration measurements that are opposite in direction to estimate the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> in a ground vehicle. A simulation was conducted to evaluate the performance and robustness of the method by adding unbiased noise to represent more realistic measurements. The method was then demonstrated on a testing vehicle using a two-post vehicle simulator. The accuracy of the estimations proved to be a viable approach for identifying the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> based purely on dynamic responses.
