25|$|Banking {{institutions}} in the United States are required to hold reservesamounts of <b>currency</b> <b>and</b> <b>deposits</b> in other banksequal to {{only a fraction of}} the amount of the bank's deposit liabilities owed to customers. This practice is called fractional-reserve banking. As a result, banks usually invest the majority of the funds received from depositors. On rare occasions, too many of the bank's customers will withdraw their savings and the bank will need help from another institution to continue operating; this is called a bank run. Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems. The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as a lender of last resort when a bank run does occur. Many economists, following Milton Friedman, believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to small banks during the bank runs of 1929.|$|E

50|$|Another {{way to look}} at the {{monetary}} multiplier is derived from the concept of money supply and money base. It is the number of dollars of money supply that can be created for every dollar of monetary base. Money supply, denoted by M, is the stock of money held by public. It is measured by the amount of <b>currency</b> <b>and</b> <b>deposits.</b> Money Base, denoted by B, is the summation of currency and reserves. Currency and Reserves are monetary policy that can be affected by the Federal Reserve. For example, the Federal Reserve can increase currency by printing more money and they can similarly increase reserve by requiring a higher percentage of deposits to be stored in the Federal Reserve.|$|E
5000|$|Net {{government}} debt {{is defined by}} the International Monetary Fund as [...] "gross debt minus financial assets corresponding to debt instruments". Financial assets corresponding to debt instruments include <b>currency</b> <b>and</b> <b>deposits,</b> debt securities and loans. In the context of the budget, general government sector net debt is equal to the sum of deposits held, government securities (at market value), loans and other borrowing, minus the sum of cash and deposits, advances paid and investments, loans and placements. The net debt to GDP ratio over time is influenced by a government surplus/deficit or due to growth of GDP and inflation, as well as movements in the market value of government securities which may in turn be influenced by movements in general interest rates and currency values.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{economies of}} scale (ES) in {{financial}} intermediation {{as a source of}} equilibrium indeterminacy. Consumption in the model can be purchased with <b>currency</b> <b>and</b> <b>deposits,</b> and ES in intermediation implies that deposit costs are decreasing in aggregate deposits. The results suggest that indeterminacy does not depend on a large degree of ES nor a large intermediation sector, but on monetary policy and the determination of nominal interest rates. Monetary policies not targeting nominal rates allow for indeterminacy to arise for any degree of ES, while policies targeting nominal rates eliminates indeterminacy for all degrees of ES. ...|$|E

50|$|Pursuant to the Currency Law of 1932 which {{authorized}} {{the creation of}} the Bank, Manchukuo adopted a unit of currency, the Manchukuo yuan, containing 23.91 grams of pure silver, the metal on which Chinese currencies traditionally were based. The Bank was required by its charter to hold as a reserve against its issued notes at least 30% of the value of such issue in gold and silver bullion, reliable foreign <b>currencies</b> <b>and</b> <b>deposits</b> with foreign banks in gold and silver accounts. The Banks notes were not required to be redeemable in specie.
