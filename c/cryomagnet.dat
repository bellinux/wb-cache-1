40|$|Since superconducting magnets cooled by liquid helium {{are limited}} to {{magnetic}} fields of about 18 teslas, {{the design of a}} 30 tesla <b>cryomagnet</b> necessitates forced convection liquid neon heat transfer in small coolant channels. As these channels are too small to handle the vapor flow if the coolant were to boil, the design philosophy calls for suppressing boiling by subjecting the fluid to high pressures. Forced convection heat transfer data are obtained by using a blowdown technique to force the fluid vertically through a resistance-heated instrumented tube. The data are obtained at inlet temperatures between 28 and 34 K and system pressures between 28 to 29 bars. Data correlation is limited to a very narrow range of test conditions, since the tests were designed to simulate the heat transfer characteristics in the coolant channels of the 30 tesla <b>cryomagnet</b> concerned.

40|$|The main {{components}} of the LHC, the next world-class facility in high-energy physics, are the twin-aperture high-field superconducting <b>cryomagnets</b> to be installed in the existing 26. 7 -km long tunnel. After installation and alignment, the <b>cryomagnets</b> have to be interconnected. The interconnections must ensure the continuity of several functions: vacuum enclosures, beam pipe image currents (RF contacts), cryogenic circuits, electrical power supply, and thermal insulation. In the machine, about 1700 interconnections between <b>cryomagnets</b> are necessary. The interconnections constitute a unique system that is nearly entirely assembled in the tunnel. For each of them, various operations must be done: TIG welding of cryogenic channels (~ 50 000 welds), induction soldering of main superconducting cables (~ 10 000 joints), ultrasonic welding of auxiliary superconducting cables (~ 20 000 welds), mechanical assembly of various elements, and installation of the multi-layer insulation (~ 200 000 m 2). Defective junctions could be very difficult and expensive to detect and repair. Reproducible and reliable processes must be implemented together with a strict quality control. The interconnection activities are optimized taking into account several constraints: limited space availability, tight installation schedule, high level of quality, high reliability and economical aspects. In this paper, the functions to be fulfilled by the interconnections and the various technologies selected are presented. Quality control at different levels (component/ interconnect, subsystem, system) is also described. The interconnection assembly sequences are summarized.

40|$|Following the {{recommendation}} of the LHC TC of June 20 th, 1995 to introduce a separate cryogenic distribution line (QRL), which opened the possibility to have a finer cryogenic and vacuum sectorisation of the LHC machine than the original 8 arcs scheme, a working group was set up to study the implications: technical feasibility, advantages and drawbacks as well as cost of such a sectorisation (DG/DI/LE/dl, 26 July 1995). This report presents the conclusions of the Working Group. In the LHC Conceptual Design Report, ref. CERN/AC/ 95 - 05 (LHC), 20 October 1995, the so-called "Yellow Book", a complete cryostat arc (~  2. 9  km) would have to be warmed up in order to replace a defective <b>cryomagnet.</b> Even by coupling the two large refrigerators feeding adjacent arcs at even points to speed up the warm-up and cool down of one arc, the minimum down-time of the machine needed to replace a <b>cryomagnet</b> would be more than a full month (and even 52 days with only one cryoplant). Cryogenic and vacuum sectorisation of an arc into smaller sectors is technically feasible and would allow to reduce the down-times considerably (by one to three weeks with four sectors of 750  m in length, with respectively two or one cryoplants). In addition, sectorisation of the arcs may permit a more flexible quality control and commissioning of the main machine systems, including cold testing of small magnet strings. Sectorisation, described in detail in the following paragraphs, consists essentially of installing several additional cryogenic and vacuum valves as well as some insulation vacuum barriers. Additional cryogenic valves are needed in the return lines of the circuits feeding each half-cell in order to complete the isolation of the cryoline QRL from the machine, allowing intervention (i. e. venting to atmospheric pressure) on machine sectors without affecting the rest of an arc. Secondly, and for the same purpose, special vacuum and cryogenic valves must be installed, at the boundaries of machine sectors, for the circuits not passing through the cryoline QRL. Finally, some additional vacuum barriers must be installed around the magnet cold masses to divide the insulation vacuum of the magnet cryostats into independent sub-sectors, permitting to keep under insulating vacuum the cryogenically floating cold masses, while a sector (or part of it) is warmed up and opened to atmosphere. A reasonable scenario of sectorisation, namely with four 650 - 750  m long sectors per arc, and each consisting of 3 or 4 insulation vacuum sub-sectors with two to four half-cells, would represent an additional total cost of about 6. 6  MCHF for the machine. It is estimated that this capital investment would be paid off by time savings in less than three long unscheduled interventions such as the change of a <b>cryomagnet...</b>|$|E

Each cryodipole is individually cold tested at CERN before its installation and interconnection in the LHC 27 km circumference tunnel. As the magnet geometry under cryogenic operation is extremely important for the LHC machine aperture, a new method has been developed at CERN in order to monitor the magnet curvature change between warm and cold states. It enabled us to conclude {{that there is no}} permanent horizontal curvature change of the LHC dipole magnet between warm and cold states, although a systematic horizontal transient deformation during cool-down was detected. This deformation generates loads in the dipole supporting system; further investigation permitted us to infer this behavior to the asymmetric thermal contraction of the rigid magnet thermal shield during cool-down.

Next, computed curves are used to model the thermoelastic behavior of a global representative volume element of the braided fabric composite. Finally, the thermoelastic behavior of the support in real working conditions is estimated using results previously obtained. For both unidirectional composite and braided fabric composite, a good agreement is obtained between estimated and measured values at several temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{is to build a}} model in a {{simulation}} software (AutoMod) {{that can be used to}} improve the logistic planning and scheduling of the assembly and installation procedures concerning the <b>Cryomagnets</b> for the LHC project at point 18. The model should provide necessary information that simplifies the scheduling of activities based on time and resource availability. This report contains the results gathered from these simulations. This work been performed in the framework of a Master thesis. It is based on data available in November 2001. It has not been updated following latter decisions but the methodology and main results are still valid...|$|R
40|$|To {{achieve the}} maximum beam {{energy in the}} LHC the {{accumulated}} length of spatial zones, dedicated to the interconnections between the main <b>cryomagnets,</b> has been limited to 3 % of the total magnetic length in the Arcs and Dispersion Suppressors. Such a low ratio leads to a very compact design of systems and subsystems situated in the LHC interconnections. The requirements concerning reliability of the LHC interconnections are very tight since {{the availability of the}} collider for physics cannot be compromised. The failure modes taken into account in the LHC interconnections are grouped into 4 categories: material failures, structural failures, fatigue failures and electrical failures. A concept of reliability oriented parametric optimization of the LHC interconnections is presented. (4 refs) ...|$|R
