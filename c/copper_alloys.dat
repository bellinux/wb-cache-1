5|$|Copper is biostatic, meaning {{bacteria}} {{and many other}} forms of life will not grow on it. For this reason {{it has long been}} used to line parts of ships to protect against barnacles and mussels. It was originally used pure, but has since been superseded by Muntz metal and copper-based paint. Similarly, as discussed in <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> in aquaculture, <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> have become important netting materials in the aquaculture industry because they are antimicrobial and prevent biofouling, even in extreme conditions and have strong structural and corrosion-resistant properties in marine environments.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is added}} to <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> such as brass and bronze, to improve {{machinability}} and for its lubricating qualities. Being practically insoluble in copper the lead forms solid globules in imperfections throughout the alloy, such as grain boundaries. In low concentrations, as well as acting as a lubricant, the globules hinder the formation of swarf as the alloy is worked, thereby improving machinability. <b>Copper</b> <b>alloys</b> with larger concentrations of lead are used in bearings. The lead provides lubrication, and the copper provides the load-bearing support.|$|E
5|$|Selenium is {{used with}} bismuth in brasses to replace more toxic lead. The {{regulation}} {{of lead in}} drinking water applications with the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 made a reduction of lead in brass necessary. The new brass is marketed under the name EnviroBrass. Like lead and sulfur, selenium improves the machinability of steel at concentrations around 0.15%. Selenium produces the same machinability improvement in <b>copper</b> <b>alloys.</b>|$|E

40|$|Lining {{the inner}} {{surface of a}} cast iron {{hydraulic}} cylinder with <b>copper</b> <b>alloy</b> would generally not be possible. In this study, {{the surface of a}} cast iron cylinder was decarburised by high temperature oxidation. The cylinder, after decarburisation, was filled with borax anhydride and heated at a temperature of 1203 K. Molten <b>copper</b> <b>alloy</b> was then injected into the cylinder, displacing the molten borax anhydride. After cooling, the embedded <b>copper</b> <b>alloy</b> was drilled along its centre axis so that a prescribed thickness of the <b>copper</b> <b>alloy</b> remained. Thus, the cast iron cylinder could be successfully lined with <b>copper</b> <b>alloy...</b>|$|R

His research there was mainly involved with the electrical, thermal, and mechanical and magnetic properties of <b>copper</b> <b>alloys.</b> He published numerous papers, and was awarded 20 patents.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{versatility}} of {{the process}} and the simplicity of its equipment and operation, shielded metal arc welding is one of the world's first and most popular welding processes. It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though flux-cored arc welding is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> can also be welded with this method.|$|E
5|$|Broaching {{works best}} on softer materials, such as brass, bronze, <b>copper</b> <b>alloys,</b> aluminium, graphite, hard rubbers, wood, composites, and plastic. However, {{it still has}} a good {{machinability}} rating on mild steels and free machining steels. When broaching, the machinability rating {{is closely related to}} the hardness of the material. For steels the ideal hardness range is between 16 and 24 Rockwell C (HRC); a hardness greater than HRC 35 will dull the broach quickly. Broaching is more difficult on harder materials, stainless steel and titanium, but is still possible.|$|E

5|$|Numerous <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> {{have been}} formulated, many with {{important}} uses. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. Bronze usually refers to copper-tin alloys, but {{can refer to}} any alloy of copper such as aluminium bronze. Copper {{is one of the}} most important constituents of silver and carat gold and carat solders used in the jewelry industry, modifying the color, hardness and melting point of the resulting alloys. Some lead-free solders consist of tin alloyed with a small proportion of copper and other metals.|$|E
5|$|GTAW is most {{commonly}} used to weld thin sections of stainless steel and non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, magnesium, and <b>copper</b> <b>alloys.</b> The process grants the operator greater control over the weld than competing processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding, allowing for stronger, higher quality welds. However, GTAW is comparatively more complex and difficult to master, and furthermore, it is significantly slower than most other welding techniques. A related process, plasma arc welding, uses a slightly different welding torch {{to create a more}} focused welding arc and as a result is often automated.|$|E
5|$|In Greece, copper {{was known}} by the name chalkos (χαλκός). It was an {{important}} resource for the Romans, Greeks and other ancient peoples. In Roman times, it was known as aes Cyprium, aes being the generic Latin term for <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> and Cyprium from Cyprus, where much copper was mined. The phrase was simplified to cuprum, hence the English copper. Aphrodite (Venus in Rome) represented copper in mythology and alchemy because of its lustrous beauty and its ancient use in producing mirrors; Cyprus was sacred to the goddess. The seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients {{were associated with the}} seven metals known in antiquity, and Venus was assigned to copper.|$|E

5|$|Solutions {{of copper}} {{compounds}} {{are used as}} a wood preservative, particularly in treating the original portion of structures during restoration of dry rot damage. Together with zinc, copper wires may be installed over non-conductive roofing materials to discourage the growth of moss. Textile fibers are blended with copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics. <b>Copper</b> <b>alloys</b> are used in musical instruments, particularly: the body of brass instruments; circuitry for all those that are electronically amplified; the bodies of brass percussion such as gongs, bells, and kettle drums; tuning heads on guitars and other string instruments; string windings on harps, pianos, harpsichords, and string instruments; and the frame elements of pianos and harps. Copper is commonly used as a base on which other metals such as nickel are electroplated.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium {{improves}} many {{physical properties}} when added as an alloying element to aluminium, copper (notably the alloy beryllium copper), iron and nickel. Beryllium does not form oxides {{until it reaches}} very high temperatures. Tools made of beryllium <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In structural applications, the combination of high flexural rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays {{and other forms of}} ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of particle detectors. The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and beryllium oxide have led to their use in thermal management applications.|$|E
5|$|Iron metal {{has been}} used since ancient times, {{although}} <b>copper</b> <b>alloys,</b> which have lower melting temperatures, were used even earlier in human history. Pure iron is relatively soft, but is unobtainable by smelting because it is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities, in particular carbon, from the smelting process. A certain proportion of carbon (between 0.002% and 2.1%) produces steel, which may be up to 1000times harder than pure iron. Crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron, which has a high carbon content. Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel. Steels and iron alloys formed with other metals (alloy steels) {{are by far the}} most common industrial metals because they have a great range of desirable properties and iron-bearing rock is abundant.|$|E
