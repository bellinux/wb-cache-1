[...] If our answer is, 'Something,' then we seem to believe in mystical entities; if our answer is, 'nothing', then we seem to talk about nothing and what sense can be made of this? [...] Certainly when we said that Pegasus was a mythological winged horse we make sense, and {{moreover}} we speak the truth! [...] If we speak the truth, this must be truth about something. [...] So we cannot be speaking of nothing.|$|E

Smith lives in Malibu, California {{with his second}} wife, {{architect}} Nancy Mack whom he married in 2004 and {{with whom he has}} three sons, Cole (born 2005), Beckett (born 2009) and Dashiell (born 2012). From 1996–1997, Smith was married to Maria St John with whom Smith had a daughter, Manon (born 1996). He also has two other children, Justin (born 1997) and Ava (born 2000) through other relationships and spends time also living in New York. Discussing his relationships and marriages Smith said [...] "I’m the dumper. I fall in love easily, but I get restless. I’ll figure it out one day. <b>Can</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about something else?" [...] Smith is also an avid fan of his hometown Michigan sports teams. Following the Chili Peppers May 14, 2017 performance in Columbus, OH, Smith sang the University of Michigan fight song [...] "The Victors". Smith's singing of the fight song made national news as the University of Michigan and Ohio State are longtime sports rivals. At shows in Ohio, Smith's drumset has sometimes featured the Michigan Wolverines logo.|$|E
2500|$|How can we {{find out}} of the single {{individual}} is ready for eternal salvation? Kierkegaard says, [...] "Any army sometimes has a select little group called the immortal battalion, and a warrior esteems it a great honor to be accepted into it. Let us suppose {{that there was a}} man who was just as concerned about being in that battalion as everyone ought to be concerned about being an heir of heaven's salvation. The conditions were sufficiently known; distinction in battle was required, but also a certain appearance, a specific height, physique, etc. He would then examine himself to see whether he filled all the requirements, not in general, not casually, because he would be too concerned for that, and he knew that if he was deficient in merely the slightest way he would not be accepted. And whether anything was lacking or everything was present in the right proportion the commander would decide in his appraisal. <b>Can</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about the Christian in the same way? No. Kierkegaard says, [...] "every person has heaven's salvation, only by the grace and mercy of God, and this is equally close to every human being {{in the sense that it}} is a matter between God and him; and let no third person, himself having been restored to grace, forfeit this by unwarranted interference. [...] If there was a person who embittered my life early and late and thought nothing but the worst of me, would his also being saved be able to disturb my salvation? ...|$|E

6000|$|But, Lord, Sir, said Will Atkins to me {{how could}} we teach them religion, who know nothing of it ourselves? How <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> to our wives of God, Jesus Christ, heaven, and hell? Why they would only laugh at us, who never yet have practiced religion, but on the {{contrary}} all manner of wickedness. Will Atkins, said I, cannot you tell your wife {{she is in the}} wrong, and that her gods are idols, which can neither speak nor understand; but that our God, who has made, can destroy all things; that he rewards the good and punishes the wicked; and at last will bring us to judgment; cannot you tell her these things? That's true, said Atkins, but then she'll tell me it is utterly false, since I am not punished and sent to the devil, who hath been such a wicked creature. These words I interpreted to the priest. [...] "Oh!" [...] said he, [...] "tell him, his repentance will make him a very good minister to his spouse, and qualify him to preach on the mercy and long suffering of a merciful Being, who desires not the death of a sinner, and even defers damnation to the last judgment; this will lead him to the doctrine of the resurrection and will make him an excellent preacher to his wife." [...] I repeated this to Atkins, who being more than ordinary affected with it, replied, I know all this, Sir, and a great deal more; but how can I have the impudence to talk thus to my wife, given my conscience witnesses against me? Alas! said he (with tears in his eye, and giving a great sigh) as for repenting, that is for ever past me. Past you! Atkins, said I, what do you mean? You know well enough, said he, what I mean, I mean it is too late.|$|E
6000|$|My Lords, weighty indeed {{would have}} been the charge brought before your Lordships by the Commons of Great Britain against the {{prisoner}} at your bar, if they had fixed upon no other crime or misdemeanor than that which I am now pressing upon you,--his throwing off the allegiance of the Company, his putting a black master over himself, and his subjecting the whole of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa, the whole of the Company's servants, the Company's revenues, the Company's farms, to Gunga Govind Sing. But, my Lords, it is a very curious and remarkable thing, that we have traced this man as Mr. Hastings's bribe-broker up to the time of the nomination of this Committee; we have traced him through a regular series of bribery; he is Mr. Hastings's bribe-broker at Patna; he is Mr. Hastings's bribe-broker at Nuddea; he is his bribe-broker at Dinagepore; we find him his bribe-broker in all these places; but from the moment that this Committee was constituted, it became a gulf in which the prevention, the detection, and the correction of all kind of abuses were sunk and lost forever. From the time when this Committee and Gunga Govind Sing were appointed, you do not find one word more of Mr. Hastings's bribes. Had he then ceased to receive any? or where are you to look for them? You are to look for them in that 500,000l. excess of expense in the revenue department, and in the rest of all that corrupt traffic of Gunga Govind Sing of which we gave you specimens at the time we proved his known bribes to you. These are nothing but index-hands to point out to you the immense mass of corruption which had its origin, and was daily accumulating in these provinces, under the protection of Mr. Hastings. And can you think, and <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> of such transactions, without feeling emotions of indignation and horror not to be described? Can we contemplate such scenes as these,--can we look upon those desolated provinces, upon a country so ravaged, a people so subdued,--Mahometans, Gentoos, our own countrymen, all trampled under foot by this tyrant,--can we do this; without giving expression to those feelings which, after animating us in this life, will comfort us when we die, and will form our best part in another? ...|$|E
60|$|Let us look {{in detail}} {{at a few}} of these {{disturbances}} of anything like inevitable or irresistible movement. Shall we not, at the very first glance, confess--I am afraid only too soon--that there always have been fools therein; fools of whom no man could guess, or can yet, {{what they were going to}} do next or why they were going to do it? And how, pray, <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> of the inevitable, in the face of that one miserable fact of human folly, whether of ignorance or of passion, folly still? There may be laws of folly, as there are laws of disease; and whether there are or not, we may learn much wisdom from folly; we may see what the true laws of humanity are, by seeing the penalties which come from breaking them: but as for laws which work of themselves, by an irresistible movement,--how can we discover such in a past in which every law which we know has been outraged again and again? Take one of the highest instances--the progress of the human intellect--I do not mean just now the spread of conscious science, but of that unconscious science which we call common sense. What hope have we of laying down exact laws for its growth, in a world wherein it has been ignored, insulted, crushed, a thousand times, sometimes in whole nations and for whole generations, by the stupidity, tyranny, greed, caprice of a single ruler; or if not so, yet by the mere superstition, laziness, sensuality, anarchy of the mob? How, again, are we to arrive at any exact laws of the increase of population, in a race which has had, from the beginning, the abnormal and truly monstrous habit of slaughtering each other, not for food--for in a race of normal cannibals, the ratio of increase or decrease might easily be calculated--but uselessly, from rage, hate, fanaticism, or even mere wantonness? No man is less inclined than I to undervalue vital statistics, and their already admirable results: but how can they help us, and how can we help them, in looking at such a past as that of three- fourths of the nations of the world? Look--as a single instance among too many--at that most noble nation of Germany, swept and stunned, by peasant wars, thirty years' wars, French wars, and after each hurricane, blossoming up again into brave industry and brave thought, to be in its turn cut off by a fresh storm ere it could bear full fruit: doing nevertheless such work, against such fearful disadvantages, as nation never did before; and proving thereby what she might have done for humanity, had not she, the mother of all European life, been devoured, generation after generation, by her own unnatural children. Nevertheless, she is their mother still; and her history, as I believe, the root-history of Europe: but it is hard to read--the sibylline leaves are so fantastically torn, the characters so blotted out by tears and blood.|$|E
