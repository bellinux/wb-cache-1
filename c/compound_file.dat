40|$|Part 2 : FORENSIC TECHNIQUESInternational audienceBecause {{files are}} {{typically}} stored as sequences of data blocks, the file carving process in digital forensics involves {{the identification and}} collocation of the original blocks of files. Current file carving techniques that use the signatures of file headers and footers could be improved by first classifying each data block in the storage media as belonging to a given file type. Unfortunately, file block classification techniques tend to have low accuracy. One reason {{is that they do}} not account for <b>compound</b> <b>files</b> that contain subcomponents encoded as different data types. This paper presents a context-based classification approach that accounts for <b>compound</b> <b>files</b> and improves on block-by-block classification schemes by exploiting the contiguity of file blocks belonging to the same file on the storage media...|$|R

2500|$|During {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the default Word {{document}} format (.DOC) became {{a de facto}} standard of document file formats for Microsoft Office users. There are different versions of [...] "Word Document Format" [...] used by default in Word 97–2007. Each binary word file is an OLE <b>Compound</b> <b>File,</b> a hierarchical file system within a file. According to Joel Spolsky, Word Binary File Format is extremely complex mainly because its developers had to accommodate an overwhelming number of features and prioritize performance over anything else.|$|E
2500|$|OLE allows an editing {{application}} to export {{part of a}} document to another editing application and then import it with additional content. For example, a desktop publishing system might send some text to a word processor or a picture to a bitmap editor using OLE. The main benefit of OLE is to add different kinds of data to a document from different applications, like a text editor and an image editor. This creates a <b>Compound</b> <b>File</b> Binary Format document and a master file to which the document makes reference. Changes to data in the master file immediately affect the document that references it. This is called [...] "linking" [...] (instead of [...] "embedding").|$|E

40|$|Motivation: High-throughput {{cell-based}} phenotypic screening {{has become}} an increasingly important technology for discovering new drug targets and assigning gene functions. Such experiments use hundreds of 96 -well or 384 -well plates, to cover whole-genome RNAi collections and/or chemical <b>compound</b> <b>files,</b> and often collect measurements that are sensitive to spatial background noise whose patterns can vary across individual plates. Correcting these position effects can substantially improve measurement accuracy and screen-ing success. Result: We developed SbacHTS (Spatial background noise correction for High-Throughput RNAi Screening) software for visualization, esti-mation and correction of spatial background noise in high-throughput RNAi screens. SbacHTS is supported on the Galaxy open-source framework with a user-friendly open access web interface. We find that SbacHTS software can effectively detect and correct spatial background noise, increase {{signal to noise ratio}} and enhance statis-tical detection power in high-throughput RNAi screening experiments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{computer}} forensics, carving is {{an important}} trick in the digital in-vestigator’s sleeve. Since files are typically stored as sequences of data blocks, the retrieval process basically consists of locating and appro-priately collating together the original blocks of each file. Traditional file carving solutions, generally based on signatures of file headers and footers, could be improved by performing a classification of each data block in the storage media as belonging to a given file type. Unfortu-nately file block classification techniques tend to be far from perfect in terms of accuracy. For an improvement of the classification results the presence of <b>compound</b> <b>files,</b> i. e. files containing sub-portions that are encoded similarly to a different data type, {{must be taken into}} account during the classifier preparation. In this work, we demonstrate that this impacts heavily on the performance of file block classifiers. In ad-dition, to generally improve the accuracy of classification, we propose a context-based classification architecture to improve block-by-block clas-sification schemes, by exploiting the contiguity of file blocks belonging to the same file on storage media. The approach is completely general and can be easily applied to any content-based file block classification algorithm...|$|R
