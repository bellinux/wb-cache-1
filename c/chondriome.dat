5|$|Mitochondria (and related structures) {{are found}} in all eukaryotes (except one—the Oxymonad Monocercomonoides sp.). Although {{commonly}} depicted as bean-like structures they form a highly dynamic network {{in the majority of}} cells where they constantly undergo fission and fusion. Mitochondria vary in number and location according to cell type. A single mitochondrion is often found in unicellular organisms. Conversely, numerous mitochondria {{are found in}} human liver cells, with about 1000–2000 mitochondria per cell, making up 1/5 of the cell volume. The population of all the mitochondria of a given cell constitutes the <b>chondriome.</b> The mitochondrial content of otherwise similar cells can vary substantially in size and membrane potential, with differences arising from sources including uneven partitioning at cell divisions, leading to extrinsic differences in ATP levels and downstream cellular processes. The mitochondria can be found nestled between myofibrils of muscle or wrapped around the sperm flagellum. Often, they form a complex 3D branching network inside the cell with the cytoskeleton. The association with the cytoskeleton determines mitochondrial shape, which can affect the function as well: different structures of the mitochondrial network may afford the population a variety of physical, chemical, and signalling advantages or disadvantages. Mitochondria in cells are always distributed along microtubules and the distribution of these organelles is also correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Recent evidence suggests that vimentin, one of the components of the cytoskeleton, is also critical to the association with the cytoskeleton.|$|E

Currently, quantitative {{understanding of its}} morphological characteristics is largely absent, despite major progress in deciphering the molecular fission and fusion machineries shaping its structure. Here we address the principles of formation and the large-scale organization of the cell-wide network of mitochondria. On the basis of experimentally determined structural features we establish the tip-to-tip and tip-to-side fission and fusion events as dominant reactions in the motility of this organelle. Subsequently, we introduce a graph-based model of the <b>chondriome</b> able to encompass its inherent variability in a single framework. Using both mean-field deterministic and explicit stochastic mathematical methods we establish {{a relationship between the}} <b>chondriome</b> structural network characteristics and underlying kinetic rate parameters. The computational analysis indicates that mitochondrial networks exhibit a percolation threshold. Intrinsic morphological instability of the mitochondrial reticulum resulting from its vicinity to the percolation transition is proposed as a novel mechanism that can be utilized by cells for optimizing their functional competence via dynamic remodeling of the <b>chondriome.</b> The detailed size distribution of the network components predicted by the dynamic graph representation introduces a relationship between <b>chondriome</b> characteristics and cell function. It forms a basis for understanding the architecture of mitochondria as a cell-wide but inhomogeneous organelle.

40|$|Crosses {{were made}} between haploid {{wild-type}} and suppressive petite strains of bakers' yeast to obtain zygotes {{for analysis of}} mitochondrial heterogeneity. Wild-type × petite zygotes contained about 40 % noncristate mitochondria when immediate mating mixtures were examined. The frequency of defective mitochondria had decreased {{to an average of}} 9. 2 % in 1 -week-old zygote isolate cultures, and to 4. 4 % in slant cultures 1. 5 years after initial zygote isolation. The latter value was not significantly different from values obtained with wild × wild zygotes of either age. The noncristate mitochondria were of two types: one lacking inner membrane invaginations or elaborations and the other containing concentrically arranged loops of inner membrane. The significance of these two types of respiration-deficient mitochondria is unknown. The gradual decrease in frequency of noncristate mitochondria, perhaps due to selection pressures in mixed <b>chondriomes,</b> was discussed as a further indication of the semiautonomous nature of the yeast organelle...|$|R
40|$|By ultrathin serial sectioning, {{morphological}} and volumetric {{changes of}} the plastidome and <b>chondriome</b> have been observed in Euglena gracilis Z during bleaching in darkness with addition of sodium acetate to the culture medium. In order not to introduce any modification to the synchronization pattern during bleaching, green cells were previously grown photoauto-trophically on Cramer & Myers medium under continuous illumination and synchronized by temperature cycles. They were then cultivated (1) photoheterotrophically with sodium acetate added to the culture medium and (2) heterotrophically by keeping the culture in darkness. This regime allowed observation of the influence (1) of synchronization by temperature cycles and (2) of sodium acetate and darkness on the plastidome and <b>chondriome</b> of photoautotrophic cells synchronized by light-dark cycles as described previously. In photoautotrophic cells, the plastidome, consisting of about ten diskoidal chloroplasts, occupies 15 % of the cell volume. The <b>chondriome,</b> {{in the form of}} one single giant mitochondrion branched throughout the cell, represents 6 % of the cell volume.

40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} ndh {{genes in the}} plastid genome of many Cymbidium species and three closely related taxa in Orchidaceae looking for {{evidence}} of ndh gene degradation. Among the 11 ndh genes, there were frequently large deletions in directly repeated or AT-rich regions. Variation in these degraded ndh genes occurs between individual plants, apparently at population levels in these Cymbidium species. It is likely that ndh gene transfers from the plastome to mitochondrial genome (<b>chondriome)</b> occurred independently in Orchidaceae and that ndh genes in the <b>chondriome</b> were also relatively recently transferred between distantly related species in Orchidaceae. Four variants of the ycf 1 -rpl 32 region, which normally includes the ndhF genes in the plastome, were identified, and some Cymbidium species contained at least two copies of that region in their organellar genomes. The four ycf 1 -rpl 32 variants {{seem to have a}} clear pattern of close relationships. Patterns of ndh degradation between closely related taxa and translocation of ndh genes to the <b>chondriome</b> in Cymbidium suggest that there have been multiple bidirectional intracellular gene transfers between two organellar genomes, which have produced different levels of ndh gene degradation among even closely related species...|$|E
40|$|Numerical, morphological, and {{topographical}} {{changes in}} the mitochondrial inventory (= <b>chondriome)</b> during the vegetative (= asexual) life cycle of Polytoma papiUatum were examined {{by means of the}} serial-sectioning technique. At the onset of interphase the <b>chondriome</b> consists primarily of one highly reticulated basket-shaped complex, which lines the periphery of the cell. Up to 3 additional fragments could be analysed, which, however, were much smaller and either spherical to ovoid, or elongated and poorly branched. During interphase growth both the size of the mitochondrial basket and the number of additional fragments (ca. 40) increases. During mitosis 1 (1. division cycle) the multiplication of the number of mitochondria gradually continues; the maximum (ca. 250) was counted at late telephase 1 and early cytokinesis 1, but it cannot be excluded that the sparser short-lived meta- and anaphase cells, which were unfortunately missed, contain an even higher number of mitochondrial units. Concomitant with mitosis 1, the mitochondrial basket is subdivided into several fragments; {{at the same time the}} mitochondria tend to form clusters and to occupy no longer merely peripheral but also more central regions. An irregular distribution of the <b>chondriome</b> results, with either local accumulations or local absence of mitochondria within definite regions of the cell. After completion of cytokinesis 1 the total number of mitochondria (ca. 80) is drastically reduced but it seems to increase again during the 2. division cycle. Irrespective of the number of preceding division cycles, the <b>chondriome</b> of young daughter cells enclosed in the sporangium usually resembles that of young interphase cells.

FRIENDLY, {{a member of the}} CLUSTERED MITOCHONDRIA superfamily, is conserved among eukaryotes and is required for correct distribution of mitochondria within the cell. We sought to understand how disruption of FRIENDLY function in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leads to mitochondrial clustering and the effects of this aberrant <b>chondriome</b> on cell and whole-plant physiology. We present evidence for a role of FRIENDLY in mediating intermitochondrial association, which is a necessary prelude to mitochondrial fusion.

40|$|AbstractHigher plant {{mitochondria}} are dynamic, pleomorphic organelles. The {{higher plant}} <b>chondriome</b> (all mitochondria {{in a cell}} collectively) is typically composed of numerous, physically discrete, mitochondria. However, frequent inter-mitochondrial fusion, enabling the mixing and recombination of mtDNA, ensures that the higher plant <b>chondriome</b> functions, at least genetically, as a discontinuous whole. Nothing {{is known about the}} genes controlling mitochondrial fusion in plants; there are no plant homologues of most of the genes known to be involved in fusion in other organisms. In contrast, the mitochondrial fission apparatus is generally conserved. Higher plant mitochondria use dynamin-like and Fis-type proteins for division; like yeast and animals, higher plants have lost the mitochondrial-specific form of the prokaryote-derived protein, FtsZ. In addition to being providers of energy for life, mitochondria provide a trigger for death. The role of mitochondrial dynamics in the initiation and promulgation of cell death is conserved in higher plants although there are specific differences in the genes and mechanisms involved relative to other higher eukaryotes...|$|E
40|$|Transition to {{flowering}} was induced in {{the shoot}} apical meristem of Sinapis alba (mustard), a long-day species, by subjecting vegetative plants {{to a single}} 22 -h long day. The ultrastructural changes occurring in the meristematic cells during the complete morphogenetic switch were investigated by quantitative methods. The earliest detectable changes are seen 18 h {{after the start of}} the inductive long day. One of these changes is the replacement of the large vacuoles of the cells of vegetative meristems by an increased number of smaller vacuoles in the cells of meristems of plants induced to flower (evoked meristems). The other earliest change is an increase in size of the <b>chondriome.</b> Remark-ably enough both changes have in common that they lead to an increase in membrane area and are thus concerned with increased membrane synthesis. In this respect this very early effect of the leaf-generated floral stimulus is very similar to that produced by various animal and plant hormones in their respective target tissues. The large rise in <b>chondriome</b> size is paralleled by an increase in succinic dehydrogenase activity. Both changes certainly reflect a rise in cellular respiratory activity which produces the necessary energy supply for the morphogenetic switch...|$|E
40|$|Seed {{germination}} {{is a vital}} developmental transition {{for production}} of progeny by sexual reproduction in spermatophytes. Quiescent cells in nondormant dry embryos are reawakened first by imbibition and then by perception of germination triggers. Reanimated tissues enter into a germination program requiring energy for expansion growth. However, germination requires that embryonic tissues develop to support the more energy-demanding processes of cell division and organogenesis of the new seedling. Reactivation of mitochondria to supply the required energy is thus a key process underpinning germination and seedling survival. Using live imaging, we investigated reactivation of mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model. Bioenergetic reactivation, visualized by presence of a membrane potential, is immediate upon rehydration. However, reactivation of mitochondrial dynamics only occurs after transfer to germination conditions. Reactivation of mitochondrial bioenergetics is followed by dramatic reorganization of the <b>chondriome</b> (all mitochondrial in a cell, collectively) involving massive fusion and membrane biogenesis to form a perinuclear tubuloreticular structure enabling mixing of previously discrete mitochondrial DNA nucleoids. The end of germination coincides with fragmentation of the <b>chondriome,</b> doubling of mitochondrial number, and heterogeneous redistribution of nucleoids among the mitochondria, generating a population of mitochondria tailored to seedling growth...|$|E

40|$|Background: Mitochondria, {{the main}} {{suppliers}} of cellular energy, are dynamic organelles that fuse and divide frequently. Constraining these processes impairs mitochondrial is {{closely linked to}} certain neurodegenerative diseases. It is proposed that functional mitochondrial dynamics allows the exchange of compounds thereby providing a rescue mechanism. Methodology/Principal Findings: The question discussed in this paper is whether fusion and fission of mitochondria in different cell lines result in re-localization of respiratory chain (RC) complexes and of the ATP synthase. This was addressed by fusing cells containing mitochondria with respiratory complexes labelled with different fluorescent proteins and resolving their time dependent re-localization in living cells. We found a complete reshuffling of RC complexes throughout the entire <b>chondriome</b> in single HeLa cells within 2 – 3 h by organelle fusion and fission. Polykaryons of fused cells completely re-mixed their RC complexes in 10 – 24 h in a progressive way. In contrast to the recently described homogeneous mixing of matrix-targeted proteins or outer membrane proteins, the distribution of RC complexes and ATP synthase in fused hybrid mitochondria, however, was not homogeneous but patterned. Thus, complete equilibration of respiratory chain complexes as integral inner mitochondrial membrane complexes is a slow process compared with matrix proteins probably limited by complete fusion. In co-expressing cells, complex II is more homogenously distributed than complex I and V, resp. Indeed, this result argues for higher mobility and less integration in supercomplexes. Conclusion/Significance: Our results clearly demonstrate that mitochondrial fusion and fission dynamics favours the re-mixing of all RC complexes within the <b>chondriome.</b> This permanent mixing avoids a static situation with a fixed composition of RC complexes per mitochondrion...|$|E

During this process the thyroid gland and the glandular lobe (lobus anterior and lobus intermedius) show a gradual increase in activity. This activity was in general most pronounced in Lebistes reticulatus (Peters) and weakest in Xiphophorus maculatus (Günther). This increase in activity suggests that the developement of the gonopodium is probably regulated endocrinally.

Here, its organization is examined theoretically by {{taking into account}} the physical association of mitochondria with microtubules. Parameters of the cytoskeleton mesh are derived from the mechanics of single fibers. The model of the mitochondrial reticulum is formulated in terms of a dynamic spatial graph. The graph dynamics is modulated by the density of microtubules and their crossings. The model reproduces the full spectrum of experimentally found mitochondrial configurations. In centrosome-organized cells, the <b>chondriome</b> is predicted to develop strong structural inhomogeneity between the cell center and the periphery. An integrated analysis of the cytoskeletal and the mitochondrial components reveals that the structure of the reticulum depends on the balance between anterograde and retrograde motility of mitochondria on microtubules, in addition to fission and fusion. We propose that it is the combination of the two processes that defines synergistically the mitochondrial structure, providing the cell with ample capabilities for its regulative adaptation...|$|E

40|$|The {{shifting}} agronomy to direct-seeded rice, {{necessitated by}} the unavailability of labor for transplanting, has exacerbated weed problems, such as Echinochloa spp., the sedges {{and red and}} weedy rices. Engineered herbicide resistance allows selective control of all these weeds in rice but is confounded by {{a higher rate of}} introgression of resistance genes into red rice than had been expected, severely limiting the utility of the technology. Gene flow can be prevented or delayed (in theory) by single generation transformation, terminator (GURT), or inducible-promoter technologies that provide transient transgene expression, or by plastome or <b>chondriome</b> transformations where there is maternal inheritance. In some cases (e. g. plastome transformation) it is known that the protection is incomplete. Mitigation technologies are suggested as an adjunct, where the transgene of choice is flanked by mitigating genes (e. g. anti shattering, anti dormancy, or dwarfing genes) deleterious to weedy types. These would result in uncompetitive progeny. Transgenic rice bearing properties that might have a fitness advantage for weeds should not be released unless it bears introgression-delaying and mitigating systems, preferably stacked to minimize the risks...|$|E
40|$|The subgenomes of {{the plant}} cell, the nuclear genome, the plastome, and the <b>chondriome</b> are known to {{interact}} through various types of coevolving macromolecules. The combination of the organellar genome from one species with the nuclear genome of another species often leads to plants with deleterious phenotypes, demonstrating that plant subgenomes coevolve. The molecular mechanisms behind this nuclear-organellar incompatibility have been elusive, even though the phenomenon is widespread and {{has been known for}} > 70 years. Here, we show by direct and reverse genetic approaches that the albino phenotype of a flowering plant with the nuclear genome of Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade) and the plastome of Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) develops {{as a result of a}} defect in RNA editing of a tobacco-specific editing site in the plastid ATPase alpha-subunit transcript.

40|$|Plant {{mitochondria}} {{are typically}} portrayed as being small, oval organelles. However, {{a recent study}} has demonstrated that the <b>chondriome</b> of shoot apical meristem (SAM) cells of Arabidopsis thaliana is unique in having two types of mitochondria, a large, central, tentaculate mitochondrion and variable numbers of small, oval mitochondria in the cell cortex that fuse with and fission from the tentaculate mitochondrion. 1 The tentaculate mitochondrion wraps around the nucleus and persists throughout the cell cycle, undergoing distinct changes in morphology and size in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Here we demonstrate that SAM cell plastids, which also contain DNA, do not reticulate, and address {{the question as to}} why SAM cell mitochondria but not plastids form reticulate structures. We postulate that the presence of a large, tentaculate mitochondrion in SAM cells provides an efficient means for homogenizing the mitochondrial DNA and proteins during vegetative life prior to gamete production, and that this mitochondrial architecture prevents speciation. The lack of plastid reticulation in the same cells most likely reflects {{on the fact that the}} individual plastids are much larger than the small mitochondria and therefore do not need to fuse to achieve efficient intermixing of their genomes...|$|E

40|$|The unitary {{nature of}} the <b>chondriome</b> of two species of trypanosomatids, Blastocrithidia culicis and Trypanosoma cruzi, has been {{demonstrated}} by utilizing serial thick-sectioning techniques combined with high voltage electron microscopy. Profiles of mitochondrial elements seen in thin sections and suspected to be parts of a continuum were confirmed by serial thick sectioning (0. 25 - 0. 50 mum thick) and stereopair analysis to be parts of the same mitochondrion. Three-dimensional models obtained from tracings of mitochondrial profiles on cellulose acetate reveal the mitochondrion of B. culicis to consist of a posterior mass with six tubular extensions extending upward and terminating in the anterior apex. The kinetoplast was found suspended {{between two of the}} tubular extensions, or less frequently, protuding as a nodule from one of the extensions. A bifurcation of one of the extensions was found in some specimens. The mitochondrion of T. cruzi consists of a triangular- shaped convoluted tubule, the base being the kinetoplast portion while the apex is directed posteriorly. The mitochondrion bifurcates behind the flagellar pocket, lateral to the kinetoplast, sending two entwined extensions into the tenuous anterior apex.

A description is given of the differentiation of macromitochondria from typical mitoehondria by a general swelling, a clearing of the matrix, and the formation of a complex tubular network. The hypothesis of fixation or anaesthesia artifacts has been dismissed because of the persistence of these transformations after different fixations and because of the existence of numerous intermediary stages between these two types of chondriosomes which imply the progressiveness of differentiation. The cytochemical demonstration of mitochondrial DNA fibers suggests that the genetic information, probably present in this type of nucleic acid, controls the differentiation and the specific metabolic activity of these organelles. The frequent relationships observed in Antheraea between the tubules of agranular reticulum and the macromitochondria which are reminiscent of the vacuoles-mitochondria associations of the adrenal cortex, {{may be related to the}} transfer of cholesterol and other precursors of steroidogenesis. In the last stages, the macromitochondria become transformed into vacuoles by a disappearance of the tubular network. The correlation revealed between mitochondrial transformations and the cyclical release of ecdysone (65) leads to the conclusion that a prominent fraction of chondriosomes is involved, in relation to the agranular reticulum, in the elaboration of steroid hormones such as ecdysone...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{search for}} recombination between mitochondrial markers {{was carried out}} in Paramecium tetraurelia. Thirty-two combinations, altogether involving 24 different markers, were studied. The markers belonged to the three main categories of mitochondrial mutations presently available in this organism. (a) Spontaneous or UV-induced antibiotic resistance mutations, most probably affecting mitochondrial ribosomes, (b) nitrosoguanidine-induced antibiotic resistance markers displaying thermosensitivity or slow growth, enabling easy selection of possible wild-type recombinants, and (c) mitochondrial partial suppressors of a nuclear gene, probably corresponding to molecular alterations distinct from the preceding two categories. In addition, different genetic configurations were analyzed (i. e., mutant x mutant, double-mutant x wild-type, etc.). —None of the combinations yielded any evidence for the occurrence of recombined genomes despite the fact that: (1) all of them were studied on a large scale involving the screening of at least several thousand mitochondrial genomes (often several millions), (2) in many of them the detection level was sufficiently high to enable the isolation of spontaneous mutants in control cells, and (3) in several of them, reconstitution experiments carried out in parallel show that the conditions were fully adequate to detect recombinant genotypes. The results are in marked contrast with those obtained on the few other organisms in which mitochondrial recombination has been studied, particularly Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which mitochondrial recombination is intense. —The most likely basis for the various manifestations of mitochondrial genetic autonomy in Paramecium, described in this as well as in previous publications, is that the <b>chondriome</b> of this organism is made up of thousands of structurally discrete, noninteracting units...|$|E

From these induced petites, 59 colonies were selected at random and established in pure culture. All strains were analyzed histochemically for mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase and succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) reactions. On the basis of counts of stained mitochondria per cell obtained by light microscopy, four different cell phenotypes were recognized among the mutant strains: (i) reduced cytochrome oxidase, wild-type SDH; (ii) reduced cytochrome oxidase, high SDH; (iii) absent cytochrome oxidase, high SDH; and (iv) absent cytochrome oxidase, wild-type SDH. The last group was the most common, characterizing 43 of the 59 strains. Electron microscopy showed differences in mitochondrial ultrastructure for the various cell phenotype classes. Electron histochemical localizations showed cytochrome oxidase reaction product only on mitochondrial membranes of respiration-competent cells.
