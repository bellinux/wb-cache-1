Her second book, He Walked the Americas (1963), is a frequently cited taxonomy of Native American legends that report of a light-skinned prophet. Her last book, The Ancient Atlantic (1969), surveys the culture and geography of the Atlantic Ocean and touches on the legend of Atlantis.|$|E
5000|$|According to Daly's biographer, James Natland, Daly was {{an early}} proponent of Arthur Holmes' and Alfred Wegener's {{continental}} drift theory. Daly summarized his ideas in his 1926 book, Our Mobile Earth, which included on the title page small print adopted from Galileo: E pur si muove. Daly's theory on <b>continental</b> <b>displacement</b> was based partly {{on the idea that}} after the Moon was ejected from the Earth, continental movement was an inevitable part of rebalancing the planet; he also suggested that continental material accruing near oceans eventually slips, and forces continents to creep along. He expanded this notion in Strength and Structure of the Earth, in 1940, where Daly anticipated aspects of plate tectonics, including introduction of a [...] "mesospheric shell" [...] and a slippery vitreous basaltic substratum.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} present and justify {{a new concept}} {{on the origin of}} {{petroleum}} and natural gas, it is desirable to show not only what is wrong with the present, popular view, but to show what went wrong from a historical perspective. I briefly review ideas of <b>continental</b> <b>displacement</b> since the sixteenth century cartographic observations that suggest the continents were once joined and then separated. I then focus on the mechanism of continent locomotion, mantle convection, first suggested some 85  years ago, that is a pillar of plate tectonics theory. Then I describe why mantle convection is physically impossible and tender a new geodynamic theory that stems from a different {{understanding of the nature of}} Earth’s early formation as a Jupiter-like gas giant. Decompression from Earth’s early protoplanetary compression explains geological and geodynamic observations formally attributed to plate tectonics without necessitating mantle convection. This new geodynamic theory provides a basis for my proposal of a new concept on the origin of petroleum and natural gas.|$|E

When Van's introduced the RV-10 they planned three engine configurations. One configuration using a smaller lighter 210 HP Continental IO-360ES, and two others using the larger 235 and 260HP Lycoming I/O-540. The #1 factory demonstrator used the IO-540, while the #2 RV-10 used the Continental IO-360. Vans decided to discontinue the support for the Continental engine after a poll which indicated that most builders would install the Lycoming engine, although this poses problems for builders in certain countries with engine displacement limitations in which the <b>Continental's</b> 360 inches <b>displacement</b> would be admitted.|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1920 s, the <b>continental</b> <b>displacement</b> theory of Wegener, {{latitude}} studies of Köppen and Wegener, and Argand's ideas on mountain building {{led to the}} first mobilistic paleogeography. In the 1930 s and 1940 s, many factors caused its general abandonment. Mobilism was revived in the 1950 s and 1960 s by measurements of long-term displacement of crustal blocks relative to each other (tectonic displacement) and to Earth's geographic pole (latitudinal displacement). Also, short-term or current displacements can now be measured. I briefly outline the categories of tectonic and current displacement and focus on latitudinal displacement. Integration of tectonic and latitudinal displacement in the early 1970 s completed the new mobilistic paleogeography, in which the transformation of rock magnetization directions into paleopoles and latitudes and the finite rotation of spherical plates about pivot points play complementary roles; this new synthesis now provides a quantitative basis for studying long-term evolution of Earth's surface features and climate, the changing environments in which life evolves...|$|E
40|$|A bstract More than 60 {{individual}} paleomagnetic poles {{have been}} obtained by various workers in the last 20 years from late Precambrian Keweenawan rocks of the Lake Superior region. Nearly all major formations and intrusive units {{have been subject to}} at least one paleomagnetic study. Keweenawan rocks thus represent paleomagnetically the world's most intensely studied rock sequence, one that may span a time interval from about 1. 2 to 1. 0 b. y. ago. The large amount of paleomagnetic data coupled with locally excellent stratigraphic and structural control allows an examination {{of the extent to which}} factors other than <b>continental</b> <b>displacement</b> determine the distribution of Precambrian paleopoles. Keweenawan paleomagnetic poles of both normal and reversed polarity plot along a northeast-southwest trending band in the North Central pacific. Stratigraphic and radiometric evidence suggests that within this polar distribution there is a hairpin-shaped path open to the southwest (the so-called Logan Loop) along which there appears to be an anticlockwise polar movement with time.

40|$|Cretaceous age, {{occupy the}} same tectonic {{position}} on the northern margin of the African-Arabian continental crust as the Troodos, Kizildag, Baer Bassit, and Oman ophiolites. Field relationships suggest that they were generated in a marginal basin. Southward subduction under the northern extension of the Arabian plate probably resulted in island arc volcanism and metamorphism, as well as development of a marginal basin to the S in the Late Cretaceous. <b>Continental</b> convergence caused <b>displacement</b> of the marginal basin ophiolites {{as well as the}} northern arc-trench complex southward onto the Arabian shelf {{towards the end of the}} Cretaceous and Tertiary. Another possibility is that the ophiolites are products of a leaky trans-tensional faults activated by- changes Cretaceous. The origins and tectonic significance of the eastern Mediterranean ophiolites which extend from Troodos in the W through Baer Bassit and Kizildag in SE Turkey to Oman in the E are problematic. The little deformed ophiolite suites of Troodos and Oman are cited as remnants of oceanic crust (Moores & Vine 1971; Glennie et al. 1973).

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 In {{order to}} {{determine}} whether the sediments found on the landward wall of the Peru Trench are accreted Nazca Plate sediments, the clay mineralogy and organic carbon contents of 52 surface samples were submitted to factor analysis. Q-mode factor analysis resolved the data from the Nazca Plate and Peru continental margin into three factors. The most important factor (oceanic assemblage) is strongly associated with Nazca Plate sediments and is comprised of smectite and aeolian illite. In contrast, upper continental margin sediments are dominated by either of the two continental factors (A or B). The principal difference between the continental factors is that mixed-layer smectite-chlorite clays are characteristic only of continental assemblage A. Lower continental margin sediments are characterized by either an oceanic or continental factor dominance. The boundary between sediments dominated by the oceanic factor and those dominated by the continental factor was as much as 100 km to the west of its present position earlier in the Quaternary. The seaward shift in the boundary is attributed to westward shoreline displacement in response to glacially-induced sea level changes, increased erosion rates on land during more humid times, and deposition of continental factor dominated sediments seaward of the present Peru Trench axis. Quaternary sediments from 27 cores reveal minor fluctuations with time in factor loadings in Nazca Plate and upper continental margin cores and significant variations in some areas near the trench axis and on the middle to lower <b>continental</b> slope. <b>Displacement</b> of oceanic sediments into areas with continental sediments is determined with respect to the factor dominance boundary. Using this method, continental accretion is indicated for five cores, located up to 3000 m above the trench floor. One core on the middle continental slope off Lima, Peru, contains diatom-rich Quaternary dolomite that probably originated as calcareous sediment on the Nazca Ridge. If this is true, left-lateral strike-slip motion of the Nazca Ridge along the Peru Trench axis is indicated. The bulk of the 28 cores recovered from the acoustically complex landward wall of the Peru Trench contain sand-silt turbidites of continental origin. Even though there is a distinct overprint of terrigenous sedimentation, accreted oceanic sediments can be recovered in a tectonically active convergent plate boundary...|$|R

Result of horizontal minimum stress (σHmin) orientation {{is compared to}} present stress distribution. We constructed 1300 km X 600 km model for Southern Ryukyu Arc. FE model was bounded along the Ryukyu Trench. Studied region is divided into 3 domains: arc region, Okinawa Trough and <b>continental</b> margin. As <b>displacement</b> velocity is 9. 0 cm/yr in Taiwan, we set up NW boundary displacement of 2000 m that correspond to c. a. 20, 000 year on Ryukyu Trench to Taiwan. Four boundary conditions under 1, 10 and 30 km depth are considered. In addition, single domain model is also constructed. Total 16 experiments are performed. Result of σHmin orientation shows good agreement with T-axis distribution in Taiwan and Ryukyu Arc (Kubo and Fukuyama, 2003; Otsubo and Hayashi, 2003). In addition, large stress concentrates on eastern area of Taiwan while in Okinawa trough, computed σHmin orientation is arc-parallel which is inconsistent with observed σHmin orientation. Depth affects greatly to the stress magnitude but not to stress orientations in the Ryukyu Arc. It is found that orientation of σHmin is principally controlled by rock domain properties of major structural zones and the direction of convergence of the Philippine Sea plate relative to Eurasia. Direction of displacement vector is good agreement with that of observed velocity field in Taiwan, while direction of displacement vector is trending NW or W in Okinawa trough and Ryukyu Arc, indicating that this model does not fit in this point...|$|R
40|$|Understanding faults is {{challenging}} but not impossible. Looking at the Punchbowl fault, an ancient {{trace of the}} San Andreas Fault in the Transverse Ranges of southern California, {{is one way to}} understand a fault that has been studied for years and still hasn?t been fully understood. I am interested in grasping the formation and structures of the damage zone of large <b>displacement</b> <b>continental</b> transform faults, in particular the San Andreas Fault. To do this, I characterized the fractures in the damage zone of the Punchbowl Fault. The fractures associated with the Punchbowl Fault include open mode fractures, transgranular cracks, transgranular filled cracks, calcite filled veins, hematite filled veins, shear fractures, and the list continues. The Punchbowl formation rock samples had already been gathered by other students and I went back and looked at new traits of the fracture system, specifically on the microscale. I separated the fractures into three categories; open fractures (OF), shear fractures (SF), and shear fractures with fill (SOF). Each of these rock samples were put on thin sections to observe on a microscale. Eventually I was able to count the number of fractures on a coarse grid and determine the fracture density. The fracture density data showed a decrease in fracture density the further away the samples were located. The primary focus was mainly on the shear fractures and open mode fractures these were the largest fractures in the thin sections. I focused on these {{to make sure that the}} fracture densities would follow those of other ancient traces of the SAF. I found that the damage zone of the San Gabriel Fault [Becker, 2012] and the San Andreas Fault at the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth [Ayyildiz, 2012] both matched the fracture density assortment I found for the Punchbowl fault...|$|R

40|$|In this study, a {{significant}} amount of geophysical and geological data has been gathered for both the Sirt and Anadarko basins. The primary intent of most of the geophysical data gathered in the Sirt basin (North Africa) and the Anadarko basin (North America) areas was petroleum oriented. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze these rifted areas of North Africa and North America. ^ For the Sirt basin area, an integrated analysis of subsurface and geophysical data was conducted using gravity, seismicity, and heat flow data. These data suggest that the Sirt basin has a number of features in common with modern and older continental rifts throughout the world. The Bouguer gravity map indicates that the Sirt basin is marked by elongate regional gravity maxima and minima trending NW-SE showing a strong correlation with the structural highs and lows known from drilling. This map also shows that the Hun graben is marked by a long wavelength negative gravity anomaly and very steep gravity gradients which delineate faults along the sides. Large deep-seated structures are also predominant on the Bouguer gravity map. Thus in some cases, it is very difficult to recognize smaller or shallower features. The third order polynomial surface map was chosen as the best approximation of the regional gravity field over the Sirt basin area. ^ The seismicity indicates that the rift margins, especially the western margin, are still tectonically active. The first motion results suggest strike-slip and normal faulting is occurring throughout the region. The waveform modeling results for the 1935 mainshock and the two largest aftershocks suggest a strike-slip mechanism with one fault plane similar to the strike of the eastern edge of the Hun graben. The seismic observations suggest that both the NW-SE distinctive faults seen in the gravity and associated NE-SW trending cross faults seen on geologic maps continue to play an important role in the western Sirt basin. Although these faults were normal faults from Cretaceous through Eocene time, they appear to behave as strike-slip faults in the present stress-regime. ^ The heat flow data show above average heat flow values in portions of the rift. The thick (3 ̆e 5 km) sedimentary section indicated from gravity studies for the eastern Sirt basin may mask any higher heat flow in this region. ^ The Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen (SOA) area was analyzed through subsurface and geophysical data. The earth model indicates that the SOA has experienced an impressive amount of modification of the crust. When reactivated by late Paleozoic events at the <b>continental</b> margin, vertical <b>displacements</b> alone exceeded 12 km. Quaternary stratigraphic relationships and ten 14 C age dates demonstrate that the latest movement on the Meers fault is late Holocene in age. ^ Seismic and gravity data suggests that the Anadarko basin shows a striking lack of symmetry with a great truncation at the south side of the basin along the frontal fault zone. Seismic data also indicates that the base of the crust is layered and transitional in character rather than a simple sharp boundary. The Moho is about 45 km deep beneath the frontal thrust zone of the Wichita uplift shallowing to about 41 km in both ends of the modeled line. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R
