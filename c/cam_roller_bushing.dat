40|$|An {{electromagnetic}} brake/clutch device {{includes a}} drive shaft supported {{by at least}} one bearing for transmitting torque, a housing, affixed to prevent its rotation, surrounding the drive shaft, and an electromagnetically activated device within the housing to selectively prevent and allow rotation of the drive shaft. The electromagnetically activated device includes a plurality of <b>cammed</b> <b>rollers</b> to prevent counter-clockwise rotation of the drive shaft. The drive shaft includes a circumferential disk and the housing includes a reaction ring for engagement with the plurality of <b>cammed</b> <b>rollers.</b> The plurality of <b>cammed</b> <b>rollers</b> are released from engagement with the circumferential disk and the reaction ring by a plurality of tripping mechanisms within the housing. The tripping action uses the locking force to act as a release force merely by changing the boundary conditions of the roller interface angles. The tripping mechanisms include trippers for disengaging the plurality of <b>cammed</b> <b>rollers</b> and an anvil shaped portion for providing lateral movement of the trippers.

50|$|In service, {{some trouble}} was {{experienced}} with transmission shaft joints and with worn <b>cams</b> and <b>rollers.</b> If the valves were set {{with the engine}} cold, {{there appeared to be}} some distortion under working conditions due to the high temperature of superheated steam which caused deterioration of the valve events. Drivers also reported that, when the engines were standing or moving at very slow speed, it was difficult to reverse since the <b>cam</b> <b>rollers</b> were not readily able to climb over the inclined surfaces leading from one cam to another. Trouble was also experienced with steam leaking past the tappet spindles into the cam boxes where it boiled up the oil and caused it to overflow from the cam boxes. This was overcome by serrating the collars of the spindle bushes to allow the steam to escape and prevent entry into the cam boxes.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>roller</b> <b>cam</b> {{design was}} first {{developed}} by Charlie Cunningham of WTB around 1982 and licensed to Suntour. [...] <b>Roller</b> <b>cam</b> brakes were used on early mountain bikes in the 1980s {{and into the}} 1990s, mounted to the head tube and seat stays in the standard locations, and below the chain stays for improved stiffness as they do not protrude {{to interfere with the}} crank. It is not unusual for a bicycle to have a single <b>roller</b> <b>cam</b> brake (or U-brake) combined with another type. They are still used on some BMX and recumbent bicycles.|$|R
50|$|There were {{originally}} eight cams for forward motion and three for reverse, which gave {{a range of}} cut-offs from 15% to 85% in forward gear. The hand reversing screw spindle carried a disk, suitably notched with a locking device {{to ensure that the}} <b>cam</b> <b>rollers</b> would be in the centre of the selected cams under working conditions. During drifting, the reversing gear is placed in the neutral position where the exhaust valves are held fully open. These conditions were ideal for drifting and superior to any Walschaerts valve gear in admitting steam to the steam chests, even with cylinders equipped with by-pass valves, snifting valves and drifting valves.|$|R

The interaction between the <b>cam</b> and <b>roller</b> follower result in high generated pressure and narrow film thickness that {{increase the risk of}} wear and fatigue.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to test a new PTFE {{impregnated}} cloth material {{for use as a}} surface layer on the pistons of a hydraulic motor at the interface with the <b>cam</b> <b>roller.</b> Tests were carried out using a standard Bowden & Leben sliding friction tester which indicated that the cloth material gave similar results to the current material (PTFE impregnated sintered bronze) in both dry and lubricated conditions. Actual component tests run on a modified twin disc test machine showed that the cloth performed better in conditions of reduced lubrication. Wear testing would be required to fully assess the feasibility of using the material in a hydraulic motor. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Because {{there is}} no camshaft, there are fewer moving parts. The <b>cam</b> shaft <b>rollers</b> and push rods have been {{replaced}} by an electro-hydraulic actuator system which uses the existing fuel pumps. This reduces development risks of the new system by employing existing technology. Direction changing on older B&W MC engines was engaged by changing the direction of the <b>cam</b> <b>roller.</b> With the new cam-less engine it is controlled by a computer. This gets rid of mechanical failures that can damage the engine if there is a malfunction in the engine when changing directions. Also, {{there is no}} chain connection between the crank shaft and the cam shaft so the engine is lighter with less points of failure. Since there is no camshaft, the parasitic load on the engine output is removed. This is particularly useful in large marine engines that can produce up to 100 megawatts as it can equate to a large amount of power saving. With a cam-less engine, fuel injection and exhaust timing are directly controlled by an Engine control unit and it can be constantly changed and adjusted without stopping the engine. This allows for the engine to run at lower RPM which is useful for maneuvering as it allows slower ship speeds for safe and precise docking. Aditionally, when a ship is maneuvering, the computer controlled Fuel injection and valve timing allows for faster RPM control, hence faster stopping in emergency situations.|$|R

It is turbocharged by a Toyota CT20 Turbo (the same unit as used in the 2L-T diesel) to generate 160 PS (119 kW) at 6,000 rpm and 152 lb·ft (206 N·m) at 4,800 rpm. This was the first turbocharged twin-cam engine built in Japan. Units built after May 1983 received a water cooled turbocharger.

40|$|The {{automotive}} {{industry and the}} design of engines are strongly ruled by performance and legislation demands. In the valve train, mechanical components such as camshafts and rollers are defined by specifications including more and more constraints concerning their ability to face wear thus prolonging lifetime. The aim of the thesis is to develop tools facilitating the choice between different manufacturing processes for wear optimization purposes of <b>cam</b> and <b>roller</b> components for IC engine valve trains. Tools are both experimental and theoretical. For the experimental part, statistical and relocated studies of wear have been performed. It is shown that measuring the very same surface before and after experiments is preferable to understand wear mechanisms of <b>cams</b> and <b>rollers.</b> A set of analysis tools for describing changes between unworn and relocated worn surfaces is developed. As results, {{it is found that}} the predominant mechanism of wear for <b>cams</b> and <b>rollers</b> is a flattening of asperities: surfaces are pressed and plastic deformations occur. In parallel, simulations have been developed to explain theoretically the wear observed. Micro and macro simulations are developed to predict the ability of a given manufacturing process to resist wear. For the microscopic simulation, a rough contact model including elasto-plastic behavior of materials is used and shows good correlations with experiments. Concerning the macroscopic simulation, a model including form deviations due to manufacturing is developed and computes oil film thicknesses and deformations. The different parameters computed by both simulations are indicators of the wear performance of different surfaces. It is shown that such simulation can rank different manufacturing processes in terms of ability to face wear...|$|R

40|$|The most {{critical}} mechanism {{on board the}} proposed space station is the continously rotating joint which must accurately align the solar power units with the sun during earth orbit. The feasibility of a multiple, discrete bearing supported joint driven by a self-loading, pinch drive actuator was investigated for this application. This concept appears to offer greater protection against catastrophic jamming, less sensitivity to adverse thermal gradients, greater accessibility to inorbit servicing or replacement and greater adaptability to very large (5 m) truss members than to more conventional continuous support bearing/gear reducer joints. Analytical trade studies performed herein establish that a discrete <b>cam</b> <b>roller</b> bearing support system having eight hangers around a continuous ring would provide sufficient radial and bending stiffness to prevent any degradation in the fundamental frequencies of the solar wing structure. Furthermore, {{it appears that the}} pinch roller drive mechanism can be readily sized to meet or exceed system performance and service life requirements.

40|$|As {{many other}} machines, the radial piston {{hydraulic}} motor contains {{a lot of}} tribological interfaces. One important area is the piston assembly and the journal bearing contact between the piston and <b>cam</b> <b>roller.</b> There exists good models to describe the performance of simpler geometries such as journal bearings, but when put into a system or when having a more complex geometry, the models do not apply very well. To be able to predict the tribological performance of such components, {{it is important to}} have a model that is able to include the real geometry and the properties of the system. A simulation model of the piston assembly in Hägglunds Compact hydraulic motor was built using FE software which made it easy to include the complex geometries. The model includes the deformation of the piston. The hydrodynamics is solved by using Reynolds equation. Density/pressure and viscosity/pressure dependency for the oil are included. The whole model was solved with the built in solvers in the software. Simulation results such as friction, hydrodynamic pressure and oil leakage was compared with test results. Good agreement between simulation and tests shows that this kind of model can be a useful tool in development and optimization of tribological systems.

50|$|Tablet presses, {{also called}} {{tableting}} machines, range from small, inexpensive bench-top models that make one tablet {{at a time}} (single-station presses), with only around a half-ton pressure, to large, computerized, industrial models (multi-station rotary presses) that can make hundreds of thousands to millions of tablets an hour with much greater pressure. The tablet press is an essential piece of machinery for any pharmaceutical and nutraceutical manufacturer. Common manufacturers of tablet presses include Natoli, Stokes, Fette Compacting, Korsch, Kikusui, Manesty, B&D, PTK, IMA and Courtoy. Tablet presses must allow the operator to adjust {{the position of the}} lower and upper punches accurately, so that the tablet weight, thickness and density can each be controlled. This is achieved using a series of <b>cams,</b> <b>rollers,</b> and/or tracks that act on the tablet tooling (punches). Mechanical systems are also incorporated for die filling, and for ejecting and removing the tablets from the press after compression. Pharmaceutical tablet presses are required to be easy to clean and quick to reconfigure with different tooling, because they are usually used to manufacture many different products.There are 2 main standards of tablet tooling used in pharmaceutical industry: American standard ‘TSM’ and European standard ‘EU’. TSM and EU configurations are similar to each other but cannot be interchanged.|$|R
