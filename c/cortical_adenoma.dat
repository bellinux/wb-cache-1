50|$|A adrenocortical adenoma (or adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenoma,</b> or {{sometimes}} simply adrenal adenoma) is a benign tumor of the adrenal cortex.|$|E
50|$|If primary hyperaldosteronism is {{confirmed}} biochemically, CT scanning or other cross-sectional imaging can confirm {{the presence of}} an adrenal abnormality, possibly an adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenoma</b> (aldosteronoma), adrenal carcinoma, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, or other less common changes. Imaging findings may ultimately lead to other necessary diagnostic studies, such as adrenal venous sampling, to clarify the cause. It is not uncommon for adults to have bilateral sources of aldosterone hypersecretion {{in the presence of a}} nonfunctioning adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenoma,</b> making adrenal venous sampling mandatory in cases where surgery is being considered.|$|E

One of five Wilms' tumors revealed more numerous renin-containing tumor cells than the adjacent renal cortex, whereas three of ten renal adenocarcinomas and two of three renal oncocytomas revealed only focally renin-positive tumor cell cytoplasms. None of six <b>cortical</b> <b>adenomas</b> were positive for renin. With available fresh tumor tissue, renin activity was studied by measuring newly formed angiotensin I by radioimmunoassay. JG tumor contained markedly elevated renin activity, whereas one Wilms' tumor and two renal adenocarcinomas contained no more than 2 % of renin activity of the renal cortex, more than 50 % of which was inactive renin.

40|$|Male {{and female}} Syrian hamsters of the strain Han: AURA from the Fraunhofer Institute for Toxicology and Experimental Medicine {{breeding}} colony were maintained as control animals for five toxicity/carcinogenicity studies and were examined {{for the presence}} of neoplastic disease either when they died or when the study terminated. In total, 250 male animals and 250 female animals in three carcinogenicity studies were analyzed as well as the results of a 6 -month study (fifty males and fifty females) and a 12 -month study (fifty males and fifty females). In the 24 -month studies, in the male animals, twenty-five organs were affected with malignant and benign tumors. In the female animals, twenty-four organs were affected with malignant and benign tumors. The most frequently affected tissue in the three 24 -month studies was the adrenal gland where 141 <b>cortical</b> <b>adenomas</b> (56. 4 %) were noted in 250 male animals and 115 <b>cortical</b> <b>adenomas</b> (46 %) noted in 250 female animals. In addition, a high incidence of squamous cell papilloma in the vagina was noted in female hamsters on the 24 -month studies. A moderate incidence of squamous cell papilloma of the nonglandular forestomach, benign granulosa cell tumor of the ovary, lymphoma of the hemopoietic system, endometrial stromal polyp, and adenocarcinoma of the uterus and islet cell adenoma of the pancreas were also observed on the 24 -month studies...|$|R
50|$|Is a well circumscribed, yellow tumour in the adrenal cortex, {{which is}} usually 2-5 cm in diameter. The color of the tumour, as with adrenal cortex as a whole, {{is due to the}} stored lipid (mainly cholesterol), from which the {{cortical}} hormones are synthesized. These tumors are frequent incidental findings at post mortem examination, and appear to have produced no significant metabolic disorder; only a very small percentage lead to Cushing's syndrome. Nevertheless, these apparently non-functioning adenomas are most often encountered in elder obese people. There is some debate that they may really represent nodules in diffuse nodular cortical hyperplasia.Very occasionally, a true adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenoma</b> is associated with the clinical manifestations of Conn's syndrome, and can be shown to be excreting mineralocorticoids.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Hormonal and {{morphological}} {{data were}} investigated in 202 consecutive patients with adrenal incidentalomas (171 unilateral and 31 bilateral) {{in an attempt}} to assess subclinical hyperfunction or malignancy. In addition to the classical evaluation, scintiscan was carried out in a large number of these patients. In unilateral incidentalomas, 83 % showed normal hormonal function, whereas 17 % had biochemical signs of adrenal overactivity (hyperaldosteronism in 3, hypercortisolism in 17, medullary hyperfunction in 9). [75 Se]Methylnorcholesterol scintigraphy depicted malignant, space-occupying lesions as decreased or absent radiotracer uptake by the mass, and <b>cortical</b> <b>adenomas</b> as increased or normal uptake. In <b>cortical</b> <b>adenomas</b> a relationship between radiocholesterol uptake and degree of functional autonomy was demonstrated. [123 I]Metaiodobenzilguanidine scintiscan visualized 7 of 8 pheochromocytomas. In bilateral incidentalomas, abnormal adrenal function was more frequent, accounting for 29 % of cases (hyperaldosteronism in 3, hypercortisolism in 3, adrenal insufficiency in 2, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia in 1). Malignant lesions were not scintigraphically visualized. [75 Se]Methylnorcholesterol scan also provided functional information {{in the case of a}} cortisol-secreting adenoma and an aldosteronoma with a concomitant contralateral nonhypersecreting adenoma, showing the greatest uptake in the hyperfunctioning adenomas. In both unilateral and bilateral lesions, endocrine testing failed to differentiate benign from malignant tumors. Although hormonal assessment is mandatory to clarify the functional patterns, only morphofunctional examination by scintiscan seems to provide more data about the likelihood of malignancy...|$|R

Forty-five adrenal masses included 25 <b>cortical</b> <b>adenomas,</b> 12 pheochromocytomas, three lymphomas, and five metastases confirmed by pathology were examined.

40|$|The {{existence}} of a link between adrenal cortex and hypertensive vascular disease is now well substantiated by experimental and clinical evidence some of which is outlined below in the historical review. Extensive investigations have been undertaken {{during the past decade}} to provide more specific information regarding the role of naturally occurring corticosteroids in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The observation that a significant increase of mean urinary aldosterone excretion occurs in groups of patients with essential hypertension, and the discovery of functional aldosterone-producing <b>cortical</b> <b>adenomas</b> associated with a progressive form of hypertension in many stimulated a renewed interest in aldosterone as a factor possibly involved in the pathogenesis of hypertensive vascular disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{coexistence}} of myelolipoma within adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenoma</b> is extremely rare, for both tumors present usually as separate entities. There are only 16 such cases reported worldwide. To {{the best of}} our knowledge, the case we reported here is the first one of myxoid adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenoma</b> associated with myelolipoma reported. A 32 -year-old Chinese woman with 4 -year history of hypertension was presented in our study. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a large heterogeneously-enhancing mass (4. 5 cm in diameter) in the left suprarenal region. Clinical history and laboratory results suggest a metabolic disorder as Conn’s syndrome. The patient underwent a left adrenalectomy, and a histopathological study confirmed the mass to be a myxoid adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenoma</b> containing myelolipoma. The patient was postoperatively well and discharged uneventfully. In the present case report, we also discuss the etiology of simultaneous myelolipoma and adrenal adenoma associated with Conn’s syndrome, and the methods of the diagnosis and differential diagnosis...|$|E
30|$|We {{reported}} an extremely rare case of giant insulinoma and simultaneous occurrence of pheochromocytoma and adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenoma</b> in the ipsilateral adrenal gland {{in a patient}} clinically and genetically diagnosed as having MEN 1.|$|E
40|$|This {{case was}} {{described}} briefly {{in a recent}} book chapter (Lennox AM, Fecteau KA: 2014, Endocrine disease. In: BSAVA Manual of Rabbit Medicine, eds. Meredith A, Lord B, pp 274 – 276. British Small Animal Veterinary Association, Gloucester, UK). In the previous description, the tumor {{was described as a}} pheochromocytoma; however, further evaluation suggested that it more closely resembled an adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenoma.</b> A 10 -year-old, spayed female rabbit was presented for a behavior change of 8 months’ duration. The rabbit was inappropriately urinating and defecating, as well as demonstrating aggressive behaviors such as chasing, biting, and mounting various objects. The rabbit had elevated progesterone, 17 -hydroxyprogesterone, and testosterone concentrations, and ultrasound examination of the abdomen showed a round, homogenous nodule measuring 1. 1 × 0. 8 × 0. 9 [*]cm in the region of the left adrenal gland. Necropsy revealed a unilateral adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenoma.</b> To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first complete description of a female rabbit with an adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenoma</b> documented in the literature...|$|E
40|$|With {{appropriate}} {{techniques and}} using liver, spleen or kidney as an acoustic window, normal adrenal gland and adrenal lesions can be delineated by ultrasonography. The right adrenal gland is usually evaluated by transverse oblique scans and coronal scans, respectively, through the anterior and middle axillary line, while the left adrenal gland is investigated by an oblique coronal scan mainly through the posterior axillary line. For adrenal lesions, ultrasonography has a sensitivity of 74 – 97 %, a specificity of 61 – 96 %, and an accuracy of 70 – 97 %. The diagnostic accuracy {{depends on the}} scanning technique and expertise of the operator, the body status of the patient, the size and functional status of the lesion, and the ultrasonographic quality. Small adrenal nodules, ileus, obesity, fatty liver, and large body status account {{for most of the}} reasons for decreased accuracy. Small adrenal nodules less than 3 cm in diameter mainly comprise functioning <b>cortical</b> <b>adenomas,</b> nonfunctioning <b>cortical</b> <b>adenomas,</b> nodular hyperplasia, and metastases. Most small adrenal masses are homogeneous and hypoechoic, and the echo patterns are nonspecific. Large adrenal masses greater than 3 cm in diameter mainly include primary adrenocortical carcinoma, lymphoma, metastasis, lymphoma, and pheochromocytoma. The echogenicity of a large adrenal mass may be hyperechoic and heterogeneous because of the higher incidence of necrosis and hemorrhage. Other uncommon adrenal masses are myelolipoma, hematoma, granulomatous lesions, hemangioma, and adrenal cysts of various origins. The differential diagnoses of a hyperechoic adrenal mass include neuroblastoma, myelolipoma, and tumor with central necrosis or heterogeneity. Calcification is encountered in both benign and malignant processes. It is sometimes difficult to differentiate benign adrenal masses from malignant lesions. Dynamic computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography play critical complementary roles in such an instance...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{with the}} {{increasing}} utilization of sectional imaging methods, most adrenal masses are incidentally found during imag-ing investigation performed for other indications(1, 2). Non-functional adenomas constitute the majority of incidentally found adrenal masses. However, the suprarenal gland is also a common site of metastasis and less frequently primary tumors including myelo-lipoma, pheochromocytoma, and adrenocortical carcinoma(1, 2). The characterization of an adrenal lesion is critical for an ap-propriate management of the patient, and is fundamentally based either on the functional or non functional behavior of the lesion, {{in addition to its}} benign or malignant nature(2, 3). Functional adrenal lesions may be symptomatic, with typical clinical and laboratory features, like in many cases of <b>cortical</b> <b>adenomas</b> and pheochro-mocytomas, which makes their characterization easier(2, 3). The characterization of non functional adrenal lesions represents a majo...|$|R
40|$|Human adrenocortical {{cells have}} been shown to express cytokeratins and vimentin. Nestin is an {{intermediate}} filament protein that is mainly expressed in the developing nervous system and that has been recently reported in rat adrenal gland as well. Using immunohistochemical and biochemical approaches, the present study demonstrates that nestin is constantly expressed in situ in the cortex of normal human adrenal glands. Nestin expressing cells were prevalently located in the zona reticularis but some positive cells could be spotted in the zona fasciculata as well. Moreover, patches of nestin-positive cells have been constantly detected on sections of <b>cortical</b> <b>adenomas.</b> In contrast, adrenal carcinomas displayed a variable number of nestin-immunoreactive cells that in some cases were virtually absent. Samples of renal clear cell carcinoma metastasis in the adrenals were also examined which did not show nestin-immunoreactivity. We propose that a positive nestin-immunoreaction could be useful in differential diagnosis of clear cell tumors in adrenal glands...|$|R

40|$|We report 2 {{cases of}} chronic {{estimated}} glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline after unilateral adrenalectomy due to primary aldosteronism. The patients {{were diagnosed with}} unilateral adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenoma</b> releasing aldosterone. Two patients were examined for hypertension and hypokalemia. Unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed in both cases, and pathology confirmed adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenoma.</b> After adrenalectomy, hypertension and hypokalemia improved to within normal range. However, the eGFR decreased postoperatively, and abdominal computed tomography scan showed decreased kidney size compared to previous images. Kidney biopsy was performed to delineate the exact cause of renal function deterioration and revealed hypertensive changes with chronic interstitial changes, indicating that glomerular hyperfiltration with aldosterone excess masked renal function damage. Physicians {{have to consider the}} probability of postadrenalectomy eGFR decline related to chronic hypertensive change...|$|E
40|$|The wider {{application}} of increasingly sensitive ultrasonography and CT scanning {{has created a}} new problem for clinical management: the incidental discovery of asymptomatic adrenal lesions. These lesions, also called "incidentalomas" may be due to a large variety of etiologies, and although most of them prove to be benign <b>cortical</b> <b>adenomas,</b> diagnostic confirmation is frequently impossible preoperatively. For this reason, a general approach, based on the relative prevalence of benign and malignant, clinically silent adrenal masses, has been defined. This same approach is usually needed in the case of myelolipoma, a rare form of benign and silent adrenal neoplasms, containing hematopoietic and fatty elements. Actually, computed tomographic aspect of such tumors is very evocative but not pathognomonic, so it doesn't eliminate the possibility of malignant lesions, especially in the presence of heterogeneities. Because of these limitations and awaiting the development of more specific diagnostic procedures, it seems cautious to approach these tumors like incidentalomas in general. PublishedN/...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the ontogeny of localization of 11 bHSD- 2 protein in the human adrenal gland. In addition, we have investigated the effects of abnormal adrenal function on 11 bHSD- 2 by determining the pattern of localization of 11 bHSD- 2 protein, and the amount and level of expression of 11 bHSD- 2 mRNA and protein in human adrenal <b>cortical</b> carcinoma and <b>adenoma.</b> In the human foetal adrenal gland 11 bHSD- 2 immunoreactivity (11 bHSD- 2 -ir) was detected in the foetal zone, whereas in normal adult adrenal glands 11 bHSD- 2 -ir was not detected by immunocytochemistry. In adrenal <b>cortical</b> carcinoma and <b>adenoma,</b> 11 bHSD- 2 -ir was detectable in specific regions, which have been identified as steroid synthesizing cells using 3 bHSD-ir as a marker. In adrenal <b>cortical</b> carcinoma and <b>adenoma,</b> 11 bHSD- 2 mRNA and 11 bHSD- 2 protein were detected by nuclease protection analysis and by western blot analysis, respectively. In summary, 11 bHSD- 2 -ir was detected in the foetal zone of the mid-gestation human foetal adrenal, whereas, 11 bHSD- 2 -ir was not detectable in the postnatal or normal adult adrenal gland. 11 bHSD- 2 protein and mRNA was induced in adult human adrenal <b>cortical</b> carcinoma and <b>adenoma.</b> The induction of expression of 11 bHSD- 2 in the adrenal cortex suggests a possible role in regulating abnormal adrenal steroidogenic function in these patients. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

40|$|A right adrenal {{tumor was}} found {{incidentally}} during abdominal computed tomography exam in a 51 -year-old female patient, {{who had had}} diabetes and hypertension for more than 10 years. The computed tomography scan was arranged for possible pancreatic lesion by a neurologist. Norepinephrine level was high in the plasma and urine. Vanillylmandelic acid level was elevated in the urine. Diurnal cortisol rhythm, plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and urine free cortisol were all normal, but the plasma cortisol concentration could not be suppressed after a standard low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. Therefore, adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenoma</b> with subclinical Cushing's syndrome was highly suspected; however, further imaging studies, including magnetic resonance image and 131 I- 6 β-iodomethylnorcholesterol adrenal scintigraphy failed to discriminate an additional tumor.

40|$|Adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenomas</b> {{occur in}} about 5 % of the {{population}} while adrenal cortical carcinoma is a rare, but very aggressive, tumour. Most carcinomas are easily diagnosed because they are obviously invasive or metastatic at presentation. However, {{it is important to}} identify malignant potential in intra-adrenal tumours. Multifactorial histological approaches have been the most commonly used approach in making the distinction between benign and malignant lesions and the uses and limitations of these will be discussed eg. in the diagnosis of oncocytic tumours. There are now a number of published studies on molecular genetic changes in benign and malignant tumours, and some have suggested that particular changes have prognostic importance in carcinoma. Abnormalities in the β-catenin pathway and overexpression of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF 2) in carcinomas appear to be important. Adrenocortical hyperplasia has long been recognised as associated with Cushing’s disease (pituitary-dependent Cushing’s syndrome) and ectopic adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) syndrome.

40|$|BACKGROUND: CD 44 is a cell surface {{glycoprotein}} {{found on}} many normal cells, mainly lymphoid and epithelial. Normal cells usually express standard CD 44 (CD 44 -S), whereas malignant tumours may express CD 44 variant isoforms (CD 44 -V). CD 44 expression {{has been described}} for neural crest derivatives. Characterisation of differences in CD 44 expression may help in the diagnosis and differentiation of distinct adrenal tumours. AIMS: To examine CD 44 expression in different layers of cortical cortex, in adrenal medulla, and in adrenal tumours. METHODS: CD 44 -S and CD 44 -V 6 expression were studied in 12 cases of adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenoma,</b> 3 of adrenal cortical carcinoma, 10 of pheochromocytoma, and 4 normal adrenal glands. RESULTS: CD 44 -V 6 staining showed cytoplasmic expression in normal adrenal cortex and in cortical adenomas and carcinomas. Pheochromocytomas also showed CD 44 -V 6 expression but in 5 of the 10 cases it was sparse, focal, and sometimes perinuclear. Strong membranous staining for CD 44 -S was observed in normal adrenal medulla. Analysis of CD 44 -S expression revealed differences between cortical adrenal tumours and pheochromocytomas. Ten of 12 cortical adenomas and 2 of 3 cortical carcinoma cells showed weak to moderate cytoplasmic staining, but all cases of pheochromocytoma had strong membranous staining. CONCLUSIONS: Membranous CD 44 -S staining may help to distinguish pheochromocytoma from adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenoma...</b>|$|E

A 36 -year-old female presented with hypertension and abdominal pain caused by a huge adrenal mass. Due to mass size and symptoms, left adrenalectomy was performed. After adrenalectomy, blood pressure remained high. Based on hormonal and genetic evaluation, the patient was diagnosed as CAH with 17 α-hydroxylase/ 17, 20 -lyase deficiency. The possibility of a tumorous change in the adrenal gland due to untreated CAH should be considered. It is important that untreated CAH not be misdiagnosed as primary adrenal tumor as these conditions require different treatments.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} whether low DHEA-S levels are predictors of cortical origin, benignity and hormonal activity in incidentally detected adrenal masses, thirty-five patients with adrenal incidentalomas were studied. All patients were operated {{on and the}} diagnosis was histologically confirmed. Basal endocrine workup included plasma determination of cortisol before and after dexamethasone (1 mg overnight), plasma ACTH (08 : 00 h), 17 -OH-progesterone, testesterone and potassium, standing plasma renin activity and aldosterone, supine and standing plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline. If necessary, we performed dexamethasone suppression tests at low (2 mg) and high (8 mg) doses, or the loperamide test (16 mg os) for evaluation of glucocorticoid activity and the glucagon test (1 mg iv) for exploring adrenal medulla function. Plasma DHEA-S was measured in all patients {{and the results were}} compared to those obtained in controls matched for age, sex and menopausal status. Suppression of DHEA-S was found in 11 out of 35 patients (31. 5 %). However, this hormonal finding occurred in 50 % of the extracortical adrenal lesions, while in proven <b>cortical</b> <b>adenomas</b> (no. = 19) it was detected in only 5 patients (26. 3 %). Sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy and positive predictive value of low DHEA-S in indicating a cortical origin of the mass were 0. 27, 0. 0, 0. 25, and 0. 80. In malignancies (no. = 6) low DHEA-S levels were found in 1 out of 2 metastases and never in cortical carcinomas. Sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy and positive predictive value of low DHEA-S in indicating a benign form were 0. 34, 0. 83, 0. 42, and 0. 91. Six out of 19 patients with <b>cortical</b> <b>adenomas</b> showed signs of hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) -axis dysfunction. Low DHEA-S levels were found in 50 % of adenomas with HPA-axis abnormality and in 15. 3 % of adenomas without hormonal activity. Sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy, and positive predictive value of low DHEA-S levels in indicating hormonal activity of the mass were 0. 50, 0. 84, 0. 73, and 0. 60. Our data indicate that the association between low DHEA-S levels and adrenal incidentalomas is frequent. Low DHEA-S appears to be a poor predictor of hormonal activity with low sensitivity and specificity in respect of cortical origin and benignity of the mass.

He was diagnosed as having a giant insulinoma (maximum diameter 18  cm) in the pancreatic tail, five other non-functional neuroendocrine tumors in the pancreatic body and tail, multiple liver metastases of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, a pituitary prolactinoma, non-functional adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenomas,</b> a pheochromocytoma in addition to a subcutaneous neurofibroma, and a cutaneous fibroma. The genetic screening revealed a deletion mutation at codons 83 – 84 in exon 2 of the MEN 1 gene. He underwent distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, cholecystectomy, right adrenalectomy, abdominal subcutaneous tumor excision, and cutaneous tumor biopsy for the purpose of tumor volume reduction. Extended right posterior segmentectomy with partial hepatectomy of S 2, S 3, and S 8 was performed to resect residual tumors 9  months after the initial surgery. Although a newly formed liver metastasis was found 19  months after the hepatectomy, he is still alive 4  years and 4  months after the initial surgery.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} adrenal <b>cortical</b> <b>adenomas</b> (ACA) and carcinomas (ACC), {{as well as}} normal adrenal cortex have been studied {{by a panel of}} 11 {{antibodies}} to characterize antigenic changes that may distinguish these morphologically similar entities. Normal adrenal cortex and ACA express low-molecular weight cytokeratin intermediate filaments. However, none of the six primary or seven metastatic ACCs were found to express detectable levels of cytokeratins. In contrast, vimentin was seen in all ACCs studied and was heterogeneously expressed by ACAs. However, its expression was usually confined to stromal elements of the normal adrenal cortex. We conclude that adrenal cortical cells undergo characteristic changes in intermediate filament expression during the process of neoplastic conversion and malignant transformation. Undetectable expression of cytokeratins and strong expression of vimentin is associated with malignant adrenal cortical lesions. In addition, we examined the antigenic phenotype of a series of primary renal cell carcinomas (RCC). Renal cell carcinomas express cytokeratins, while ACCs do not. The majority of primary RCCs express Lewis blood group isoantigens (most commonly Lewis X), while ACAs and ACCs do not. The panel of antibodies described here may help to distinguish morphologically similar lesions of like histogenesis (ACAs vs. ACCs) and lesions of different histogenesis (adrenal vs. renal) {{on the basis of their}} composite antigenic phenotypes...|$|R
