40|$|In {{this study}} we {{evaluate}} the influences of optical property assumptions on near-infrared diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) flow index measurements. The optical properties, absorption coefficient (µa) and reduced scattering coefficient (µs′), are independently varied using liquid phantoms and measured concurrently with the flow index using a hybrid optical system combining a dual-wavelength DCS flow device with a commercial frequency-domain tissue-oximeter. DCS flow indices are calculated at two wavelengths (785 and 830 nm) using measured µa and µs′ or assumed constant µa and µs′. Inaccurate µs′ assumptions resulted in much greater flow <b>index</b> <b>errors</b> than inaccurate µa. Underestimated/overestimated µs′ from − 35 %/+ 175 % lead to flow <b>index</b> <b>errors</b> of + 110 %/− 80 %, whereas underestimated/overestimated µa from − 40 %/+ 150 % lead to − 20 %/+ 40 %, regardless of the wavelengths used. Examination of a clinical study involving human head and neck tumors indicates up to + 280 % flow <b>index</b> <b>errors</b> resulted from inter-patient optical property variations.

40|$|Constructing pattern {{classification}} based media indexing {{applications for}} distributed processing environments (DPEs) often requires knowledge in feature extraction {{as well as}} distributed processing. In order to achieve an appropriate tradeoff between <b>indexing</b> <b>error</b> rate and processing time, feature extractors (FEs) must be carefully selected based on their application specific indexing and DPE specific processing characteristics. In this paper we propose an algorithm which given a trainable pattern classifier, a generic FE library, a DPE (within a certain class of DPEs) and a manually indexed media stream, automatically generates a sequence of media indexing application configurations. The algorithm is based on task graph scheduling and feature subset selection, combined in a heuristic search procedure.

Our research interesting is focused on using some low-cost off-the-shelf sensors, such as strap-down IMU, inexpensive single GPS receiver. In this paper, we present an autonomous vehicle navigation method by integrating the measurements of IMU, GPS, and digital compass. Two steps are adopted to overcome the low precision of the sensors. The first is to establish sophisticated dynamics models which consider Earth self rotation, measurement bias, and system noise.

Data processed with SPSS software and analyzed with descriptive and inference statistics.

40|$|Retrieval of size {{distributions}} from multispectral {{optical depth}} measurements requires solution of an illposed inverse problem. The illposedness causes {{problems such as}} solution ambiguity. Size distribution retrieval becomes more complicated {{in the presence of}} nonspherical particles and/or refractive <b>index</b> <b>errors.</b> A new retrieval algorithm is first developed that allows for both smoothing and nonnegativity constraint along with the Lcurve method for choosing the Lagrange multiplier that controls the degree of the imposed smoothing. This new algorithm is compared with an iterative algorithm and the method of truncated singular value decomposition, demonstrating that the new algorithm outperforms the other two. With the new algorithm to perform the size distribution retrieval and with the T-matrix method to calculate optical depth for a given cloud consisting of randomly oriented finite circular cylinders, the influence of particle nonsphericity on the size distribution retrieval is investigated by use of the Mie theory for spheres as well as the anomalous diffraction theory for cylinders. The results show that spurious particles and even spurious particle modes occur for both approximations. The effect of refractive <b>index</b> <b>errors</b> are also investigated, showing that even a small perturbation of refractive indices can cause serious distortions of retrieved size distributions. A further examination reveals that either applying an approximate light scattering theory (Mie theory or anomalous diffraction theory) to nonspherical particles or using incorrect refractive indices results in systematic errors in the model which in turn conspire with the illposedness inherent in the retrieval to cause the distortions of retrieved size distributions. The retrieval process essentially t [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} a non-linear dynamic {{model for the}} study of the vibration signals generated by gear transmissions. The developed model considers both the parametric excitations due to the variable compliance of bearings and gears, can handle changes in the transmitted torque and allows the integration of the dynamic equations quickly and accurately. This model has been developed previously by the authors to assess the profile deviations on the dynamic behavior of gear transmissions and its influence on the transmitted torque. It also includes the presence of gear defects as cracks and pitting during the calculation of meshing forces. In this paper, the model has been enhanced in order to include two common defects such as <b>index</b> <b>errors</b> and run out or eccentricity <b>errors.</b> <b>Index</b> <b>errors</b> occur as a result of a non-uniform angular distribution of the tooth profiles along the pitch circle. Run out appears due to the displacement of the geometric center of the gear with respect to the center of rotation of the shaft on which it is mounted. Although both errors are caused by different reasons, sometimes they have been confused because of their similitudes. The procedure for including both kinds of errors in the model is described and simulations under several transmitted torques are presented. The results are assessed and compared focusing the attention on certain transmission parameters and magnitudes as transmission error, load forces in the tooth flanks and demodulation techniques on the resulting vibratory signals.
