40|$|Background: Stunted {{children}} with cystic fibrosis (CF) have less net protein anabolism than do {{children with}}out CF, {{and the result}} is retarded growth in the CF patients. It is not known whether protein intake above that recommended by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation would further stimulate whole-body protein synthesis. Objective: We studied the effects of 3 amounts of protein intake on whole-body protein synthesis and breakdown by using isotopic infusion of [1 -C- 13] valine and [N- 15 (2) ]urea in children with stable CF who required tube feeding. Design: In 8 pediatric CF patients, we administered 3 randomly allocated isocaloric diets with normal (NP), intermediate (IP), and high (HP) amounts of protein (1. 5, 3, and 5 g (.) kg(- 1) (.) d(- 1), respectively) by <b>continuous</b> <b>drip</b> <b>feeding</b> during a 4 -d period at 6 -wk intervals. Each patient acted as his or her own control. On the fourth day of feeding, whole-body protein synthesis and breakdown were measured. Results: Protein synthesis was significantly higher in the HP group ((x) over bar +/- SEM: 1. 78 +/- 0. 07 mu mol kg(- 1) (.) min(- 1)) than in the IP (1. 57 +/- 0. 08 mu mol (.) kg(- 1) (.) min(- 1); P 0. 001) and NP (1. 37 +/- 0. 07 mu mol kg(- 1) (.) min(- 1); P < 0. 001) groups. There {{were no significant differences in}} protein breakdown. Net retention of nitrogen was significantly higher in the HP group (12. 93 +/- 1. 42 mu mol (.) kg(- 1) (.) min(- 1)) than in the IP (7. 61 +/- 1. 40 mu mol (.) kg(- 1) (.) min(- 1); P = 0. 01) and HP (2. 48 +/- 0. 20 mu mol (.) kg(- 1) (.) min(- 1); P < 0. 001) groups. Conclusion: In stunted children with CF requiring tube feeding, the highest stimulation of whole-body protein synthesis was achieved with a short-term dietary protein intake of 5 g (.) kg(- 1.) d(- 1...|$|E
40|$|Glycogen {{storage disease}} type III (GSDIII) {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} of glycogenolysis due to AGL gene mutations, causing glycogen debranching enzyme deficiency and storage of limited dextrin. Patients with GSDIIIa show involvement of liver and cardiac/skeletal muscle, whereas GSDIIIb patients display only liver symptoms and signs. The International Study on Glycogen Storage Disease (ISGSDIII) is a descriptive retrospective, international, multi-centre cohort study of diagnosis, genotype, management, clinical course and outcome of 175 patients from 147 families (86 % GSDIIIa; 14 % GSDIIIb), with follow-up into adulthood in 91 patients. In total 58 AGL mutations (non-missense mutations were overrepresented and 21 novel mutations were observed) were identified in 76 families. GSDIII patients first presented {{before the age of}} 1. 5 years, hepatomegaly was the most common presenting clinical sign. Dietary management was very diverse and included frequent meals, uncooked cornstarch and <b>continuous</b> gastric <b>drip</b> <b>feeding.</b> Chronic complications involved the liver (hepatic cirrhosis, adenoma(s), and/or hepatocellular carcinoma in 11 %), heart (cardiac involvement and cardiomyopathy, in 58 % and 15 %, respectively, generally presenting in early childhood), and muscle (pain in 34 %). Type 2 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in eight out of 91 adult patients (9 %). In adult patients no significant correlation was detected between (non-) missense AGL genotypes and hepatic, cardiac or muscular complications. This study demonstrates heterogeneity in a large cohort of ageing GSDIII patients. An international GSD patient registry is warranted to prospectively define the clinical course, heterogeneity and the effect of different dietary interventions in patients with GSDIII...|$|R

Injecting the same cancer extract in portal vein by a syringe for five days, mast cells in the liver decreased in the total number in initial stage, which was associated {{with an increase in}} the number of destructed cells.

When the body experiences hypoperfusion, body perfusion is prioritized to brain and heart, which may cause the hypoperfusion of splanchnic organ. Splanchnic hypoperfusion will cause ischemia of the mucosa, disturbance in the barrier, and increased splanchnic permeability, which in further level mayl cause bacterial and endotoxin translocation to systemic circulation.
