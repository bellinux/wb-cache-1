50|$|At {{this time}} Edinburgh {{was known to}} have a demand for gardeners and William Burnes took the opportunity, {{spending}} {{the next two years}} 'landscaping' for Sir Thomas Hope in the city, part of his work being in Hope Park, later known as The Meadows. He next found employment in Ayrshire, working first for the Laird of Fairlie in 1750, and later moving to Carrick and working near Maybole. He was a good worker and received a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>character</b> from the session clerk and minister of Dundonald. In 1754 he was employed by the Crawfords of Doonside for a period of two years, lodging at Doonside Mill and saving for his future, his father having probably died at around this time, freeing him from the maintenance payments he had been making to his retired father back at Denside. He was ambitious to set up as a nurseryman for himself so he feued, from Dr Alexander Campbell of Ayr, seven and a half acres of land at Alloway. Unable to make a living in this way alone, he obtained in the summer and autumn of 1757 a position as head gardener at Doonholm, the estate of a retired London doctor, Provost William Fergusson of Ayr.|$|E

50|$|A similar {{account was}} {{reported}} by Reverend George Young, who was told by Major George Robinson that Scott was confined to a roughly made coffin on the presumption that he had died when shot on by the firing squad. Robinson said that five hours later he and Riel entered the room where Scott's coffin was being kept and heard Scott beg for death. Robinson fled the room, Riel closed the door and, a few moments later, Robinson heard a shot and presumed that Scott was then dead. This account was cast into suspicion, though, as Riel had fired Robinson as the editor of New Nation on 19 March 1870, so it remains unclear {{whether or not these}} accounts are based in fact or acted to defame Riel in retaliation for Robinson's dismissal. Upon Scott's death, Reverend George Young forwarded Thomas Scott's documents to his brother Hugh. These documents included Scott's commendatory letters and <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>character</b> written by Presbyterian minister of whose church Scott had been connected to in Ireland. Additionally his life savings were sent to his brother. It has been suspected that because it was a such substantial amount ($103.50), that this money might have indicated an immoral lifestyle.|$|R

40|$|Alexander Gray {{was born}} in County Tyrone in October 1858. His father, the Reverend Alexander Gray, was a presbyterian {{minister}} who lived in Aghaloo, Lismulladown. In 1880, the young Alexander entered the Royal Irish Constabulary cadet school in the Phoenix Park, Dublin to train as a police officer. Like his fellow candidates for the cadet ship, {{he had to be}} aged between twenty-one and twenty-six, be unmarried, be at least five feet five inches tall and <b>of</b> <b>good</b> health: 'free from any physical defect of body, impediment of speech, defect of sight or hearing, disposition to constitutional or hereditary disease, well developed'. He had to receive <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> moral <b>character</b> from two clergymen or two magistrates of the county in which he was resident, before going to Dublin Castle to sit a competitive examination in subjects including arithmetic, orthography, English composition, geography, British history, Latin the law of evidence and the elementary principles of law. Then it was off to the training depot in the Phoenix Park. A cadetship was a preliminary step to the rank of sub-inspector to which qualified cadets succeeded as vacancies arose. Gray graduated from the RIC cadet school on 22 March 1882 at the age of twenty-three. The following January, he received his first posting as a 3 rd sub-inspector to Dingle in County Kerry. By 1887, he had reached the position of district inspector in the area...|$|R
5000|$|North Carolina {{first made}} an effort to hire {{qualified}} teachers in 1845. This act required school committees to [...] "contract with a suitable teacher for their respective district, with strict regard to be had to the qualification and moral character of said teacher." [...] In 1847, the law was made more precise, and a committee of examination was created to appraise the adequacy of the teachers in the common schools. The provision stated, [...] "the board of superintendents are authorized and empowered to appoint a committee of examination, consisting of not more than five persons, whose duty it shall be to examine into the qualifications, both mental and moral, of all such persons as may apply for employment as teachers in any of the common schools in their respective counties. No person shall be employed as a teacher in any of the common schools in any county of the State in which an examining committee is appointed, unless he obtain from a majority of the committee of examination for the county in which he seeks employment a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> his <b>good</b> moral <b>character</b> and sufficient mental qualifications as such teacher." [...] In 1852, the law was amended, establishing a committee of no more than five persons, with whom {{the chairman of the board}} is established. The amended act also stated, [...] "no certificate issued to a teacher shall be good for a term for more than one year, and shall not be good for any county other than the county that issued the certificate." [...] A new administrative position was created in 1872, giving title to the new [...] "County Examiner." [...] The position duties involved, [...] "the County Examiner of each county shall examine all applicants for teachers' certificates at the courthouse of each county on the first Thursday of January and July of every year, and continue the examination from day to day during the remainder of the week, if necessary, till all applicants are examined. He shall grant certificates to all applicants of sufficient moral and mental qualification. If any person shall apply for an examination and certificate at any other time, the applicant shall pay the Examiner a fee of one dollar. If the County Examiner shall become satisfied that any person to whom a teacher's certificate has been granted is guilty of any immoral or disreputable conduct, he shall revoke the certificate and give notice to the secretary of the County Board of Education." ...|$|R
