50|$|Solvent-based {{coatings}} contain solvents at {{concentrations of}} approximately 70 to 75 {{percent by volume}} (1). The solvent composition is typically a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatics, ethers, <b>cellosolves</b> and acetates. This method produces significant VOC (volatile organic compound) and HAP (hazardous air pollutant) emissions. The coatings have good abrasion resistance and high quality, but the high VOC emissions have virtually eliminated their use in can plants.|$|R

The control of these lacquer thinners are completed by California Air Resources and South Coast Air Quality Management District. New ingredients to match air standards in lacquer thinner are now available such as Oxsol 100, soy methyl esters, ethylene glycol and there is ongoing development.|$|R
5000|$|Trichrome stains {{in which}} dyes and a {{polyacid}} are applied sequentially are called multi-step trichromes. In [...] "one-step" [...] methods, all the dyes—with {{or without a}} polyacid—are combined in a single solution. One of the oldest single-step approaches to trichrome staining is van Gieson's method, which stains muscle and cytoplasm yellow, and collagen red. Another is the Gömöri trichrome stain, which closely mimics Masson's trichrome. In [...] "yellowsolve" [...] methods, a red dye in dilute acetic acid is first applied, then the section is very thoroughly dehydrated {{to ensure that no}} moisture remains. The red dye is then displaced by a yellow dye in a solvent, such as <b>cellosolve</b> (2-ethoxy-ethanol). The name yellowsolve is a blend of the terms yellow and <b>cellosolve.</b> Lendrum's phloxine-tartrazine for cell inclusions is one example of a yellowsolve stain.|$|E

5000|$|Commercial rust {{converters}} are water-based {{and contain}} two primary active ingredients: Tannic acid [...] and an organic polymer. Tannic acid chemically converts the reddish iron oxides into bluish-black ferric tannate, {{a more stable}} material. The second active ingredient is an organic solvent such as 2-Butoxyethanol (ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, trade name butyl <b>cellosolve)</b> {{that acts as a}} wetting agent and provides a protective primer layer in conjunction with an organic polymer emulsion. Some rust converters may contain additional acids to speed up the chemical reaction by lowering the pH of the solution. A common example is phosphoric acid, which additionally converts some iron oxide into an inert layer of ferric phosphate.|$|E

5000|$|The {{cell wall}} of C. cupreum is largely {{composed}} of chitin and glucan, which {{is reflected in}} the large number of acquired genes encoding class V chitin synthase and glucan synthase found in the C. cupreum cDNA. The vegetative mycelium is profusely branched, septate and multicellular; the mycelial cells are multinucleate. The species is distinguished from other Chaetomium species by a high frequency of boat-shaped ascospores and copper coloured terminal hairs. The fruiting bodies occur {{on the surface of the}} substratum and are attached by undifferentiated rhizoids. The perithecia of C. cupreum are ovate in shape and copper colored with dimensions of 110-120 x 120-130 μm. The presence of long, thin hairs on the outer surface of the perithecium is a characteristic feature of Chaetomium (Gr. χαίτη = long hair). In C. cupreum, these hairs are numerous, thin, septate lateral hairs with a base 3.0-3.5 μm in diameter. Hairs at the apex of the perithecium are rigid, septate, 4.5-6.0 μm in diameter with 1-2 spirals. The apical hairs are covered with small copper coloured granules whose pigment is soluble in alcohol, ether, <b>cellosolve,</b> xylol but insoluble in water. Club-shaped asci measuring 38 × 13 μm develop in clusters n the interior, basal part of the perithecium. Each ascus contains 8 reddish ascospores that are boat shaped with dimensions of 10.0 × 5.5μm. The walls of the asci are mucilaginous and disintegrate, causing the ascospores to remain inside the perithecium at maturity, embedded in mucilaginous jelly. The ascospores and the mucilaginous matrix form a paste that is extruded through the apical opening in the the perithecium producing [...] "cirrhi" [...] resembling toothpaste squeezed out from a toothpaste tube. Chaetomium cupreum is intermediate between the species: C. trilaterale Chivers and C. aureum Chivers. C. aureum and C. cupreum both produce conspicuous cirrhi while C. trilaterale does not. The ascospores of C. cupreum are similar shape but larger than C. aureum. The pigment produced by C. trilaterale in agar cultures is water soluble while the granules produced on C. cupreum are insoluble.|$|E
40|$|We {{report in}} this paper that typical solvent {{developers}} for PMMA {{can be used to}} develop PMGI (polydimethyl glutarimide) with a contrast much higher than that reported using base developers. Three developers were studied: methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), 2 -ethoxyethanol (<b>cellosolve),</b> and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK). MIBK developer results in the highest contrast of 6. 7 which is comparable to that of PMMA, followed by MEK (4. 0) and then by <b>cellosolve</b> (2. 6). The sensitivity is around 1000 5 C/cm 2, roughly four times that of PMMA and almost independent of the developers. Higher resist baking temperature leads to higher contrast for MEK and <b>cellosolve,</b> whereas for MIBK the optimum baking temperature is 200 0 C. Both MIBK and MEK (but not <b>cellosolve)</b> developers can resolve 50 nm pitch grating with slight line distortion which is similar to that achievable by PMMA. Using a single step development, a double layer of PMMA and PMGI could be employed to facilitate the liftoff process or to fabricate a T-shaped gate structure, while a multilayer stack can be used to produce 3 D metal structures by electroplating.

Lead was concentrated as a pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (APDC) chelate on a miniature MF, which was 5 mm in diameter, 2 mm in effective filtering diameter and 0. 2 μm in pore size. After collection of the lead chelate on MF, the MF was cut {{so as to be}} 3 mm in diameter using a punch. This tiny MF was dissolved in 100 μl of a dissolution solvent (methyl <b>cellosolve),</b> which resulted in a high concentration efficiency. When 10 ml of a sample was used, the concentration ratio was 100. The addition of 5 × 10 (- 5) M Zephiramine to the sample solution before chelation was effective for collecting lead; the recovery was almost 100 %. The filtering time was 15 min for a 10 ml sample solution. The detection limit was 10 ppt when a 10 ml of sample solution was concentrated in 200 μl of methyl <b>cellosolve.</b> Measurements by GF-AAS were carried out using 40 μl of a methyl <b>cellosolve</b> solution.

The SK assignment {{is based on the}} scientific rationale and logic outlined in the Current Intelligence Bulletin (CIB) 61 : A Strategy for Assigning New NIOSH Skin Notations [NIOSH 2009]. The summarized information and health hazard assessment are limited to an evaluation of the potential health effects of dermal exposure to ME. A literature search was conducted through July 2010 to identify information on ME, including but not limited to data relating to its toxicokinetics, acute toxicity, repeated- dose systemic toxicity, carcinogenicity, biological system/function-specific effects (including reproductive and developmental effects and immunotoxicity), irritation, and sensitization. Information was considered from studies of humans, animals, or appropriate modeling systems that are relevant to assessing the effects of dermal exposure to ME. Methyl <b>cellosolve</b> is potentially capable of causing multiple adverse health effects following skin contact. A critical review of available data has resulted in the following SK assignment for methyl cellosolve: SK: SYS.

Carbon nanotubes injection methods in the form of suspension in polar (acetone, cyclohexanone, butanol- 1, ethyl <b>cellosolve)</b> and non-polar (o-dimethylbenzene) solvents for alkyd primers and in the form of suspension in Р - 5 А solvent and curing agent for epoxy primer were examined. In all cases the carbon nanotubes suspension in curing agent and solvent was produced by previous dispersion in cell ultrasonic bath during 15 minutes with further mixture during 20 minutes on laboratory dissolver with milling mixer. The investigation showed that modification of the alkyd primer Belakor with carbon nanotubes suspension in polar solvents increases primer properties to a greater degree than carbon nanotubes suspension in non-polar solvents. For epoxy primers it was determined that modification with carbon nanotubes suspension in solvents is more effective than in curing agent. The modification of epoxy primer with carbon nanotubes suspension in curing agent decreases coating properties in many cases, probably because of functional groups adsorption on the surface of carbon nanotubes, which results in under-cured coatings; it can be seen from decreasing hardness, and consequently, protection properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{analytical}} method for {{the determination of}} phosphorus in ultrapurified water was developed. Ultrapurified water was evaporated to concentrate phosphorus and the final sample volume for analysis was 10 ml. In 0. 55 mol 1 (- 1) HCl, orthophosphate forms molybdophosphate, and then the molybdophosphate forms ion associate with Malachite Green (MG), which can be collected on a tiny membrane filter (diameter: 5 mm, and effective filtering diameter: 2 mm). After the ion associate on the membrane filter is dissolved together with the membrane filter in I ml of methyl <b>cellosolve</b> (MC), the absorbance of MC solution is measured at 627 nm by a flow injection-spectrophotometric detection technique. When 10 ml of the sample solution {{was used for the}} procedures and absorbance measurement, the calibration graph is linear up to about 500 ng 1 (- 1) of phosphorus and the detection limit was 8 ng 1 (- 1) (S/N = 3).

40|$|A {{sensitive}} {{analytical method}} for {{the determination of}} trace amounts of silicate in ultrapurified water was developed. The method {{is based on the}} formation of an ion associate of molybdosilicate with malachite green (MG) and the collection of the ion associate on a tiny membrane filter (diameter: 5 mm, and effective filtering diameter: 1 mm). The ion associate formed on the membrane filter is dissolved together with the membrane filter in 1 ml of methyl <b>cellosolve</b> (MC) and the absorbance of MC solution is measured at 627 nm by a flow injection-spectrophotometric detection technique. In this method, silicate in the original sample (ultrapurified water) is concentrated as the ion associate into a small volume of MC to get high sensitivity. As sample concentration takes place, the small amounts of silicate contained in the reagents used also become concentrated as the ion associate into MC. The original sample volumes are varied and evaporated to an identical volume. Therefore, the reagent added is fixed to the same volume. The absorbance increase linearly with increase in the original sample volume will be due only to silicate in the original samples (ultrapurified water). The resulting slopes obtained by varying the sample volumes are compared with the slope of the calibration graph, and thus named the slope comparison method (SCM). The SCM facilitates a more sensitive and accurate evaluation of silicate concentration in the samples than either common calibration method (CCM) or standard addition method (SAM) because it compensates for the influence of trace amounts of silicate contained in chemicals, reagent solution and solvent used. The calibration graph was constructed from 0 to 0. 25 ng ml(- 1) of Si and the detection limit was 10 pg ml(- 1) (ppt) when 30 ml of samples was used. The standard deviation and relative standard deviation from six measurements of the reagent blanks were 0. 0012 and 3. 5 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The fern Blechnum sprucei {{grows in}} Mesoamerica (Costa Rica) and South America, from Colombia to Bolivia, SE and centre of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. It is a distinctive, {{somewhat}} vulnerable, mostly orophilous species. Fresh and dry herbarium material {{was used for}} this study. Herbarium material for anatomical studies comes from CTES, BA, LP, MA, SI and UC (Holmgren et al. 1990). Selected representative specimens are additionally cited after taxonomic treatment of the species. Dry material was restored with aqueous 4 : 1 butil <b>cellosolve.</b> Pinnae were cleared with aqueous 6 % NaOH, then coloured with aqueous 1 % TBO (Gurr 1966). 							Hand made transverse sections of young and adult stipes, and costae were done in fresh and restored herbarium material. Venation and epidermal patterns were analyzed in basal, apical and medium pinnae, but only the latter were illustrated. The size and density of stomata were measured in medium pinnae from all studied samples, values shown are the average of 25 measures per sample; sizes are expressed as minimum, media and maximum length x width, in μm, and density as minimum, media and maximum number of stomata / mm 2. Spores were studied with SEM, mounted on metal stubs with double sided tape, covered with gold under vacuum and photographed with a Jeol /EO JSM 6360 (15 KV) SEM. Spores were also studied with light microscope, mounted in DePeX (DePeX mounting medium, Gurr, BDH Laboratory Supplies, Poole BH 15 1 TD, UK) and measured using an ocular micrometer. Measurements {{are based on a}} minimum sample of 100 spores taken from different specimens. Sizes are expressed as the longest equatorial diameter/ polar diameter, in μm. Gametophytes were studied from material collected in the subtropical forest of Tucumán Province, Argentina. Spore samples for cultures were taken from single sporophytes kept dry at room temperature since the date plants were collected. 							Gametophytes were grown under fluorescent light. Multispore cultures were established on mineral agar. 							Percentage of germination was recorded for a random sample of 50 spores from each of the two plates, every three days until there was no further increasing. Gametophytes were stained with chloral hydrate acetocarmine. 							The species has large sporophytes, suberect, scaly rhizomes, and dimorphic fronds with short, scaly stipes and lanceolate to elliptic sterile laminae. The rachises can grow indefinitely as radicant axis that vegetatively multiplicate the plants. Pinnae are lanceolate, herbaceous, with crenate and papillose margins, superficially scaly and hairy, peciolulate, with free, visible veins regularly once furcated near the costa, ending in large, active hydathodes. 							The broadly elliptic fertile laminae bear distant pinnae, with vegetative tissue reduced to the portion that supports the indusium and the continuous coenosorus; terminal indefinite rachis, not proliferous, may be present.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{an account of}} studies made on the {{distribution}} and nature of acid mucopolysaccharides in the mammalian renal papilla. The papilla {{was found to be}} the only region of the kidney which has an appreciable extracellular space with acid mucopolysaccharide enmeshed in connective tissue fibres. Animals are unable to secrete urine which is either more concentrated or more dilute than plasma unless the tonicity of this region is greater than that of plasma. In {{the first part of this}} work (Chapter 2) the extent of extracellular acid mucopolysaccharide was correlated with the ability of the species to conserve water. It was found that the papilla could be sharply delineated by staining the acid mucopolysaccharide within it. This had the advantage over the less distinct cut surface appearances in that it was possible accurately to measure the length of the papilla in relation to that of the cortex and medulla in stained sections. An empirical relationship between the development of the papilla and the ability to secrete hypertonic urine was obtained for a number of species: U max = 1. 74 (Mandprime;/Candprime;) + 0. 6, where U max is the maximum concentration in Osmols/litre that can be achieved in the urine; Mandprime; is the length of the papilla, measured as the distance of the region containing extracellular acid mucopolysaccharide from the papillary tip towards the renal cortex; and Candprime; is the continuation of this line through the medulla and cortex. The correlation coefficient for the six species for which figures for maximum urinary concentration were known was 0. 9. The significance of this expression is discussed in Chapter 2 in relation to a similar equation put forward by Black in 1965. The morphology of the connective tissue in the papilla of the guinea pig was examined by light and electron microscopy (Chapter 3) and by histochemistry (Chapter 4). The histological results were correlated with the electrophoretic and staining characteristics of acid mucopolysaccharides extracted from this region. There was very little collagen of the adult type to be found in the papilla. The main fibrillar component was reticulin which was well demonstrated by silver impregnation and the periodic acid - Schiff technique. Within the reticulin mesh another class of PAS positive fibril was found which, in addition, stained positively for anionic groups. These fibrils could not be impregnated with silver. In the electron microscope the second class of fibril was seen not to be banded and to be smaller than the reticulin fibrils. The histochemical results (Chapter 4) showed that the largest part of the amorphous extracellular acid mucopolysaccharide in the papilla was hyaluronic acid. In addition, two quantitatively small fractions were observed in the biochemical extracts which were associated with the extracellular acid mucopolysaccharide. Both these fractions stained metachromatically with thiazine dyes and were shown to incorporate radioactive sulphate. In sections metachromatic extracellular material was confined to the tip of the papilla: In this region of high in vivo osmotic pressures the interstitial cells also contained monochromatic granules. The exact nature of these two fractions was not elucidated, nor was an attempt made to identify the intracellular granules with its synthesis or destruction. The results from the morphometry of the kidneys of fourteen species (Table 2 / 1) showed that desert species have long papillae which contain a limited amount of connective tissue. The metachromatic staining of extracellular acid mucopolysaccharides extends further towards the cortex in those species which can secrete highly concentrated urine. On the other hand, the papillae of animals which habitually produce dilute urine were squat in outline and contained abundant connective tissue. The tip of the papilla in these species was not found to stain set metachromatically. The extent of metachromasia was thus found to be related to the development of high tonicity in vivo, and thus to be most prominent in that part of the papilla where the sodium concentration is greatest in life. It was observed histologically that acid mucopolysaccharide was associated with the lateral spaces between collecting tubule cells in the guinea pig. It had been suggested by Ginetzinsky in 1958 that the material found between these cells in the rat constituted the barrier between fluid in the collecting tubule lumen and the interstitium. He postulated that antidiuretic hormone released hyaluronidase from the apex of the collecting tubule cell and that the enzyme then digested the intercellular cement permitting tubular fluid to equilibrate osmotically with the interstitium. The material between collecting tubule cells the guinea pig was extracted and information about its nature was obtained from its behaviour in electrophoresis and from its staining characteristics. It was found to be a very soluble acid mucopolysaccharide which contained sulphate and PAS positive groups, both of which features distinguish it from hyaluronic acid. The histological technique had thus to be modified to preserve as much as possible of the material in the thin (3 andnbsp;andmu;) wax sections required for the optimal demonstration of this region in the light microscope. The fixative developed to give the most satisfactory retention of acid mucopolysaccharide at the same time as preserving cytological structure reasonably well was as follows: Formol (40 % CHO) 100 ml <b>Cellosolve</b> 225 ml Distilled water 45 ml Aminoacridine hydrochloride 1. 6 gm. After fixation the tissue blocks were passed directly into pure cellosolve: Rinsing in aqueous solutions was avoided. Aminoacridine hydrochloride is soluble in <b>cellosolve</b> hence excess precipitant was removed during dehydration without running the risk that acid mucopolysaccharide might be leached out. The blocks were cleared in the usual way and then embedded in ester wax which was found to be superior to paraffin wax for a number of reasons discussed in Chapter 4. Radioactive sulphate was used to trace the synthesis of acid mucopolysaccharide by the collecting tubule cells. After injection of the label, radioactivity was first seen in sections to be associated with PAS positive, amylase resistant granules in the Golgi regions of the collecting tubule cells. After longer intervals radioactivity became associated with granules near the apical and lateral borders of the cells. The Golgi region as demonstrated morphologically (Chapter 3) was always seen to be between the nucleus and apical or lateral borders of the cell and never between the nucleus and the base. Similarly, material which had incorporated radioactive sulphate was never seen to pass across the base of a collecting tubule cell. The reasons for associating the development of an extensive Golgi region with the synthesis of acid mucopolysaccharide by these cells is discussed in connection with the results published by others working with embryonically similar gut cells. It proved possible by autoradiography to identify positively the material in the biochemical extract that had come from the collecting tubule cells. Autoradiography of tissue sections one hour after injection of the label showed that radioactivity was limited to the collecting tubule cells: Similarly only one band in the electrophoretic separation of acid mucopolysaccharides extracted from the papilla after this interval contained radioactivity. By noting how this band stained before and after the action of enzymes upon the material within it, it was concluded that the material associated with collecting tubule cells had the following features: It contained protein which could not be digested by papain. It contained a limited amount of 'neutral' polysaccharide which could be stained by the PAS routine. It could not be digested by amylase. It stained as strongly at pH 1 with Alcian Blue as it did at pH 3. 5 : This indicated that its anionic groups were sulphate and that carboxyl groups placed little part in the staining. It incorporated radioactive sulphate. The acid mucopolysaccharide component was partially degraded by commercial bovine testicular hyaluronidase. In Chapter 5 the changes in the morphology of acid mucopolysaccharides in the interstitium and between collecting tubule cells that arise when guinea pigs are dehydrated, injected with ADH or hyaluronidase, or given a water load are recorded. In animals given a water load the structural fibrils of the papillary interstitium become widely separated and, at the same time, the apparent space between tubules is increased. However, morphometry showed that the actual volume of the interstitium did not alter significantly whether the animal was water laden, deprived of water or injected with ADH. The significance of this observation is discussed in view of the contrary reports concerning changes in interstitial volumes: In the present study it was concluded that hydration of the acid mucopolysaccharide gel trapped within the fibrils accounted for their expanded appearance in diuresis. In antidiuresis papillary tubules were closely packed and a number of thin walled vessels, which were not normally observed by light microscopy appeared to be pulled open. This observation could be explained by contraction of interstitial cells under the influence of ADH, or by an increased force exerted on certain fibrils in the interstitium as a result of local changes in the physical propertied of acid mucopolysaccharides. No evidence could be found in this study to support active contraction of the interstitial cells. A model (Fig. 6 / 3) is presented to explain how a system of fibrils ad hyaluronic acid could enable water to be removed from the papilla in antidiuresis without a reduction in the tonicity of the papilla as a whole. The difference in volume of collecting tubule cells in hydration and dehydration was measured. In both cases the basal width of the cells averaged 9. 4 andnbsp;andmu; under the conditions of measurement. The average length of the cells in hydration was 13 andnbsp;andmu; falling to 10 andnbsp;andmu; on ADH infection or water deprivation. The change from columnar to cuboidal shape decreased the cell volume by 23 %. Autoradiographic evidence was obtained which showed that the acid mucopolysaccharide associated with the apex of the collecting tubule cell was depolymerized in antidiuresis. The removal of a layer of acid mucopolysaccharide from this site could account for most of the volume change noted 1 n sections not stained for acid mucopolysaccharides. It was possible that there was also some shrinkage of the cytoplasmic volume by osmosis in antidiuresis but the evidence for this was equivocal. There was nothing in the results from this study to support the hypothesis that hyaluronidase was released by apocrine secretion from the collecting tubule cells. 'Granules' of a size which could just be resolved optically (ie. of andfrac 14; to andfrac 12;andnbsp;andmu; in dia.) could be seen between collecting tubule cells (fig. 4 / 6). These 'granules' contained anionic groups which stained in the same way as the material at the apex of the cells. The resolution that is possible with light microscopical autoradiography was insufficient to prove that these particles incorporated sulphate in parallel with the apical material. The arrangement of the Golgi region in these cells (fig. 3 / 12) suggested that secretion took place into the lateral intercellular spaces as well as across the apex. However, granules were never seen between the cells in the electron microscope, and it is suggested that the granular appearance of this region in the light microscope arises from the plane of section of the cellular interdigitations. The amount of acid mucopolysaccharide between collecting tubule cells wan reduced when guinea pigs were deprived of water or given ADH. Removal of apical material with preservation of that between cells, or vice versa, was never observed. This result is discussed in Chapter 6, and a model is put forward to explain how such a system could regulate the flow of water across the collecting tubule wall. The evidence arising from studies by other workers which suggests a role for a hyaluronic acid/hyaluronidase system in the physiology of the kidney is reviewed in Chapter 6 : This, and the criticism of the hypothesis of Ginetzinsky (1958) is discussed in the light of findings in the present study. It is concluded that renal acid mucopolysaccharides are involved in maintaining the constancy of the 'milieu interior' of the papilla, which determines that of the blood and ultimately of the whole body. It is thought that an understanding of the actual mechanisms by which they do this has probably been delayed by the modern emphasis on cellular activity with the result that the functional significance of connective tissue has tended to be overlooked. </p...|$|E
40|$|In this study,Three {{kinds of}} drying oils for the {{manufacturing}} water soluble air-drying alkyd resins,then blend {{it with a}} high imino methylated melamine resin crosslinker, neutralizing agents and other additives for wood coatings and then the properties of paints were investigated. The molecular weight and its distribution were determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). The rheological properties were measured by Viscometer, and the drying time of film was obtained by drying recorder. The crosslinking reaction and weatherability were determined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) {{was used to evaluate}} the curing kinetics. It was found that the nature of drying oils, neutralizing agents, and cosolvents would significantly influence on the molecular weight, viscosity, stability, drying time and curing kinetics of the paints. When the tung/castor oil, was used as resin generally it showed a higher molecular weight and viscosity than those using soybean or linseed oil. The diethylamine neutralizing agent for paints exhibited the best stability and lower viscosity, In contrast, ammonia exhibited lower stability. The paints which included the resin that using linseed oil,ammonia and butyl <b>cellosolve</b> (EGMBE), showing the fastest drying time for coating film. However, the drying time of the film was found to be significantly decreased, due to blending it with high imino methylated melamine resin. But the crosslinking peak was very weak on the FTIR plot. It was also found that below 109 ℃ during the solvent evaporation stage,the endothermic peak occurred and it would suppress the DSC exotherm associated with the autooxidation crosslinking reaction. However,the temperature was above 109 ℃,the solvent would be completely evaporated,and exothermic reaction would occur,therefore the crosslinking reaction of amino alkyd resin at high temperature would be performed. It was found that the solvent may significantly influence on thermal behavior, and it was also found that the alkyd resin with more iodine value and lower preexponential constant (InZ) and lower activation energy, generally it would have a short drying time. The physical and chemical properties of the coating film depended on the rate of evaporation and stability of the neutralizing agent and the number of unsaturated double bond and hydroxyl group of oil modified alkyd resin. The paints those including the neutralizing agent and using ammonia, showed the best film hardness and water-resistance; but the paint using diethylamine system, exhibited a higher thermal degradation than that of the other 2 kinds of neutralizing agents. Regarding the evaluation of paint which contained a drying oil, linseed oil modified resin, it had a higher film hardness. In contrast, a blend of the drying oil which soybean oil was used as modified resin, it showed both better water-resistance and thermal degradation-resistance. In addition, whatever the substrate was used as coating, {{it was found that the}} film had good flexibility after 15 cycles of cold and hot treatment. In order to qualify the weatherability, the coated wood was placed in the artificially accelerated weatherometer (enclosed carbon-arc type) for 240 hours. The paint system which included ammonia and soybean oil modified resin still maintained a higher gloss retention than that of the other formulations. In addition,the film of the coated wood appeared to have better appearance after 240 hours of exposure. According to the SRS-FTIR measurement, the absorption peak of the methoxyl group (915 cm- 1) and alkyl group (1376 cm- 1) disappeared after 240 hours of exposure. The absorption peak of the triazine ring (1556 cm- 1) disappeared after 268 hours, while the absorption peaks of the carbonyl group(1710 cm- 1, 1721 cm- 1) increased after 268 hours. It was found that the fastest drying time for coating film in air was the alkyd resin containing 5 % trimethylol propane diallyl ether (TMPDAE). Alkyd resin containing 10 % or 15 % had a longer drying time, therefore it would not have any improved effect. With a relative humidity under 65 % and various temperature, it was found that in creasing the temperature resulted in an increased speed of the drying of the film. It also indicated the synergism of both temperature and relative humidity in affecting the drying rate of film. The alkyd resin coating containing 5 % TMPDAE in air at 50 ℃ and under 45 % RH, 2 hours drying time would be required. When UV illumination was applied, the drying time was reduced to 1 hour. Under these condition, the drying time of film was 9 - 18 times faster than drying in air at 25 ℃ and under 65 %RH condition. With a DSC experiment, it was found that increasing the TMPDAE content, resulted in an increasing in the speed of the crosslinking reaction of the film. This indicated that the synergism of temperature and TMPDAE would affect the rate of crosslinking reaction. 高亞胺型甲基化三聚氰胺樹脂可作為水溶性醇酸樹脂之架橋劑，在不需添加酸觸媒下能夠調配氣乾型水性塗料。使用膠體滲透層析儀 (GPC) ， 霍氏 轉換紅外線光譜儀(FTIR) ，示差掃瞄熱卡儀(DSC) 及其他相關儀器 ，評估 樹脂塗料系統之性質及塗膜性能，結果歸納如下： 1. 樹脂塗料之分子量、黏度、穩定性、乾燥性、硬化動力學及塗膜物理 化學性能，主要受乾性油種類，中和劑種類所影響。桐油／篦麻油者 顯示最高分子量及黏度，依次為大豆油及亞麻仁油者；二乙胺中和之 塗料具有最佳穩定性及低黏度；氨者則穩定性最差，含亞麻仁油變性 之結合劑、氨中和劑及乙二醇單丁醚(EGMBE) 共溶劑之配方，塗膜乾 燥速度最快。 2.
