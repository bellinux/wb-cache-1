40|$|Understanding the <b>recovery</b> of <b>gas</b> from {{reservoirs}} featuring pervasive nanopores {{is essential}} for effective shale gas extraction. Classical theories cannot accurately predict such <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> and many experimental observations are not well understood. Here we report molecular simulations of the <b>recovery</b> of <b>gas</b> from single nanopores, explicitly taking into account molecular gas-wall interactions. We show that, in very narrow pores, the strong gas-wall interactions are essential in determining the <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> behavior both quantitatively and qualitatively. These interactions cause the total diffusion coefficients of the gas molecules in nanopores to be smaller than those predicted by kinetic theories, hence slowing down the rate of <b>gas</b> <b>recovery.</b> These interactions also lead to significant adsorption of gas molecules on the pore walls. Because of the desorption of these gas molecules during <b>gas</b> <b>recovery,</b> the <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> from the nanopore does not exhibit the usual diffusive scaling law (i. e., the accumulative recovery scales as R ∼ t^ 1 / 2 but follows a super-diffusive scaling law R ∼ t^n (n> 0. 5), {{which is similar to}} that observed in some field experiments. For the system studied here, the super-diffusive <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> scaling law can be captured well by continuum models in which the gas adsorption and desorption from pore walls are taken into account using the Langmuir model.

30|$|Substitute the {{calculated}} cumulative production at different production time in Eq. (33), {{and the relationship}} between <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> and well pattern density can be obtained, as shown in Fig.  6.

When the well pattern density is 45 – 60  km 2 /well, the increase rate of the <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> is not obvious. Because the controllable reserves of a single well are certain. When the well pattern density exceeds the technical limit well density of a single well, it is usually not used to reduce the well spacing to improve <b>gas</b> <b>recovery.</b> When it is compared with the Sherka’s empirical formula, the trend of this model in the paper is generally the same, except that the nodes and amplitudes of the curve rise are different.|$|R

This article conducts drainage and <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> simulating caculation, analyses the impact of gas flow rate, the moisture content of bottomhole and eddy current tool structure of its drainage effect, basing on the theory of gas-liquid two-phase flow. The results show that: the gas flow rate, moisture content and the normal section shape of eddy current tool spiral piece are the main factors that affect the eddy current tools draining. As follows: the larger the gas flowing rate, the better the tool draining effect; when the bottomhole moisture content is less than 10 %, the draining effect is not obvious; but when the bottomhole moisture content is greater than 10 %, with higher the moisture content, the draining effect is more obvious; the normal section shape of spiral piece {{is better to be}} rectangular rather than trapezoidal; the direction of rotation of the spiral piece (left and right hand) has little effect on draining...|$|R

30|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} involved in stimulation of ultra-tight gas sandstones is fluid retention.

In this article, emphasis is placed on fluid retention since literature review has identified fluid retention as the most prevalent cause of reduced gas productivity from tight gas reservoirs.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 Horizontal {{drilling}} and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing {{made it possible}} to develop US shale resources. Shublik shale is one of such US shale resources - {{it is one of the}} largest source rocks for hydrocarbon accumulations located on the Alaska North Slope. This study used the workflow introduced by Mirzaei and Cipolla in 2012 to investigate the effects of fracturing fluid flowback; shale porosity; matrix, fracture and unpropped zone permeability; hydraulic fracture spacing; permeability anisotropy; non-Darcy flow; gas adsorption/desorption using the complex-fracture-network model, referred to as an Unconventional Fracture Model (UFM), and Voronoi grid on well performance in the Shublik shale formation. In addition, the effects of natural fracture network orientation, fracture spacing and length were examined using a single porosity model with incorporated Discrete Fracture Network (DFN). The Schlumberger Mangrove Plug-In for Petrel platform was used to conduct the study. Mangrove has the DFN feature, which can be deactivated in the single porosity model. The results suggested that ignoring fracturing fluid flowback and non-Darcy effects can lead to overestimation of the <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> factor. Neglecting <b>gas</b> adsorption/desorption effects leads to underestimation of the <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> factor. In addition, smaller fracture spacing leads to a higher <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> factor. DFN orientation, fracture spacing and length affect the propped fracture area and should be incorporated into analysis from shale plays since it can result in either overestimation or underestimation of the <b>gas</b> <b>recovery</b> factor depending on fracture network propagation. Finally, examining multiple hydraulic fractures instead of one fracture is more accurate due to the stress shadowing effects and fracture network propagation...|$|R
