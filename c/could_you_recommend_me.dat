6000|$|... "I {{discern the}} wisdom of your advice so clearly," [...] said the Greek, with the bright smile which was {{continually}} lighting up the fine form and colour of his young face, [...] "that I will ask you for a little more. Who now, for example, {{would be the most}} likely patron for me? Is there a son of Lorenzo who inherits his tastes? Or is there any other wealthy Florentine specially addicted to purchasing antique gems? I have a fine Cleopatra cut in sardonyx, and one or two other intaglios and cameos, both curious and beautiful, worthy of being added to the cabinet of a prince. Happily, I had taken the precaution of fastening them within the lining of my doublet before I set out on my voyage. Moreover, I should like to raise a small sum for my present need on this ring of mine," [...] (here he took out the ring and replaced it on his finger), [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> to any honest trafficker." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must {{study this}} {{question}} of value," [...] said Sir Charles dubiously, refilling his goblet. [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> a good book on the subject?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{the same}} time," [...] resumed the New Englander, [...] "as you confess {{yourself}} accustomed to this tragical business, {{and the people}} to whom <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> are your own former associates and friends, <b>could</b> <b>you</b> not yourself undertake the transport of the box, and rid me at once of its detested presence?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And pray, sir," [...] {{said the}} big stranger, {{stepping}} up to me as I was about to move away, [...] "can <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> to a good hotel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am very sorry,' said Coningsby, 'that I {{have only}} another day left; but pray tell <b>me,</b> what would <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> most to see within a {{reasonable}} distance of Manchester?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Foster {{could not}} help admitting that it was, {{as long as it}} lasted! [...] "But what," [...] he asked, [...] "what {{security}} has Ben-Ahmed that you won't be as false to him as <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> to be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{laughed as}} he {{acknowledged}} {{that it would be}} dreadful. [...] "It is very dreadful, Mary, to have nothing to eat and drink. But what is a man to do? Would <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> to say that black is white?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In short, <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> to {{anticipate}} the arrival of my second childhood," [...] said poor Mr. Casaubon, with some bitterness. [...] "These things," [...] he added, looking at Lydgate, [...] "would be to me such relaxation as tow-picking is to prisoners in a house of correction." ...|$|R
5000|$|Early in 2000, the San Francisco Chronicle interviewed co-founder Mike Speiser {{and early}} member Brian Koller, with Speiser {{claiming}} the system prevents advertorials from getting exposure, but Koller saying: [...] "There {{is a lot}} of 'You scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours,' and mutual admiration societies. <b>You</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> and mine, I’ll do the same for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Strafford," [...] I {{said to him}} {{one morning}} with such an air of unconcern as I could muster, [...] "I've an idea I'd like to read a little science. <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> a work on biology?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> some books?" [...] she repeated. [...] "I {{know you}} are a great reader. I have {{no one else to}} ask. We can buy no books. We can make debts for jewelry and bonnets and five-button gloves, but we can't spend a sou for ideas. And yet, though you may not believe it, I like ideas quite as well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allow me {{to finish}} what I have to say. If you marry for money {{you will do}} that which is in itself bad, and which is also unnecessary. What other course would <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> to take? No one goes into the gutter {{while there is a}} clean path open. If there be no escape but through the gutter, one has to take it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I hope, sir, <b>you</b> will <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> {{to be the}} sick-nurse; I {{was here}} {{to bring you the}} tidings lang before ony o' thae lazy queans." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> to <b>me</b> {{a proper}} person {{to fill that}} honourable station, sir?" [...] said I, smiling to myself, and {{exceedingly}} curious to hear the answer.|$|R
6000|$|BURGE-LUBIN. Thank {{you for a}} {{handsome}} compliment. I have a big dog; {{and he is the}} best fellow I know. If you knew how much uglier you are than a chow, you wouldn't start those comparisons, though. [Rising] Well, if you have nothing for me to do, I am going to leave your heel {{for the rest of the}} day and enjoy myself. What would <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> to do with myself? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind, ma'am," [...] the {{sergeant}} said. [...] "Truly kind indeed; and I humbly accept your offer, except that {{so long as}} I live she shall be no expense to you. I earn more than enough for my wants, and can, at any rate, do something towards preventing her from being altogether a burden on your hands. And now, ma'am, how would <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> {{to go to work}} with the vindictive old man up at the Hall?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... --"and help me in {{a little}} difficulty. Our {{housekeeper}} (you [...] know we are strictly blue ribbon--a cordon bleu, I call [...] her) has become engaged to a plumber, and she is leaving [...] us. Can <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> another? I know how interested [...] you are (in spite of your wicked jokes) in our little [...] enterprise. And we also want a girl, {{to be under the}} [...] housekeeper, and keep the accounts. Surely you will come to [...] see me, whether you can advise me or not.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not wont {{either to}} thrust myself upon acquaintance, madam, or to give trouble," [...] said the guest; [...] "nevertheless, I shall need the {{assistance}} of a domestic to assist me to dress--Perhaps <b>you</b> can <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> to such?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O, Mr. Springrove,' said Cytherea, {{suddenly}} recollecting herself; 'I am much {{obliged to}} <b>you</b> for <b>recommending</b> <b>me</b> to Miss Aldclyffe.' She began to warm towards the old man; {{there was in}} him a gentleness of disposition which reminded her of her own father.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear lord, you {{are just}} the person I wanted to meet. <b>You</b> promised to <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> a servant who had {{travelled}} in the East.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not if I {{can prevent}} it," [...] said Crosbie. [...] "But, {{to tell you}} the truth, Mr. Broughton, my bill will be dishonoured unless I can have it renewed. If it does not suit you to do it, I suppose <b>you</b> can <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> to some one who can make it convenient." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{think it}} could be done, sir,' replied Squeers, as if he had never {{considered}} the proposition before. 'Let me see; four fives is twenty, double that, and deduct the--well, a pound either way shall not stand betwixt us. <b>You</b> must <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> to your connection, sir, and make it up that way.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, {{surely you}} know? Your friend, Farmer Springrove, the cider-maker, and who keeps the Three Tranters Inn; who <b>recommended</b> <b>you</b> to <b>me</b> {{when he came}} in to see me the other day?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm a frame-carpenter," [...] {{answered}} the new arrival. [...] "Got {{fired from the}} Hastings saw-mill when work slacked down. Couldn't find anybody who wanted me at Vancouver, so I struck out for the mountains and mines. Found worse luck up here; spent all my money and wore my clothes out, but the boss of the Orchard Mill, who took me for a few days, said I might tell <b>you</b> he <b>recommended</b> <b>me.</b> I'm about played out with getting here, and I'm mighty hungry." ...|$|R
6000|$|Morrison. [...] And {{some folks}} find [...] A sizzling {{radiator}} to their mind. [...] What else have <b>you,</b> there, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>recommend</b> [...] To {{the attention of}} a country friend? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What you say are {{the words}} of truth, good Darkush; I <b>could</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>you</b> with a safe conscience. I dreamt last night that there would many piastres pass between us this visit.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I promise," [...] said Lewis, [...] "and {{whatever}} I promise {{mother will}} fulfil, so make your mind easy on that head. Now, mother, I shouldn't wonder if Captain Wopper <b>could</b> provide <b>you</b> with that other little inexpensive luxury you mentioned this morning. D'you think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>recommend</b> a page?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, the {{circumstances}} {{were a little}} against me. We met at a dull dinner, among wearisome worldly men, full of boastful talk about themselves. It was all 'I did this,' and 'I said that'--and the gentlemen who were present had always been right; and the gentlemen who were absent had always been wrong. And, oh, dear, {{when they came to}} politics, how they bragged about what they would have done if they had only been {{at the head of the}} Government; and how cruelly hard to please they were in the matter of wine! Do <b>you</b> remember <b>recommending</b> <b>me</b> to spend my next holiday in Scotland?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll {{break your}} neck if you don't do {{something}} for me. No, I didn't mean that. Don't be angry, old fellow.' He wiped the sweat off himself as he fought to regain composure. 'I'm a bit restless and off my oats, and perhaps <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>recommend</b> some sort of sleeping mixture,--bromide of potassium.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{presence}} is utterly needless, my good lord;-and, my best friend, Master Heriot," [...] said the young nobleman, [...] "I shall understand nothing {{the better for}} cumbering you with my ignorance in these matters; and can only say at the end, as I now say at the beginning, that I dare not take the helm out of {{the hand of the}} kind pilots who have already guided my course within sight of a fair and unhoped-for haven. Whatever <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> to <b>me</b> as fitting, I shall sign and seal; and the import of the deeds I shall better learn by a brief explanation from Master Heriot, if he will bestow so much trouble in my behalf, than by a thousand learned words and law terms from this person of skill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{far from}} {{satisfied}} with our Siwash guide," [...] he said. [...] "In fact, I am {{by no means}} sure that he knows the country, and as we propose making for the big lake and camping by it, I should prefer to send him back if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>recommend</b> us anybody who would take us there." ...|$|R
5000|$|Darwin was {{throwing}} {{himself into his}} work and his [...] "big book" [...] on Natural Selection was well under way, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace. It enclosed about twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, an unexpected response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell. Shocked {{that he had been}} [...] "forestalled", Darwin sent it on that day to Lyell, as requested by Wallace, with a letter: Some year or so ago <b>you</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>me</b> to read a paper by Wallace in the 'Annals,' which had interested you, and, as I was writing to him, I knew this would please him much, so I told him. He has to-day sent me the enclosed, and asked me to forward it to you. It seems to me well worth reading. Your words have come true with a vengeance-that I should be forestalled. You said this, when I explained to you here very briefly my views of 'Natural Selection' depending on the struggle for existence. I never saw a more striking coincidence; if Wallace had my MS. sketch written out in 1842, he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters. Please return me the MS., which he does not say he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write and offer to send to any journal. So all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed, though my book, if it will ever have any value, will not be deteriorated; as all the labour consists in the application of the theory.I hope you will approve of Wallace's sketch, that I may tell him what you say.|$|R
6000|$|The cutler {{proceeded}} to say, as he bowed {{and was about}} to withdraw, that he saw there would be merry days yet in Old England, and that Bilboa blades would fetch as good a price as ever. [...] "I remember," [...] he said, [...] "gentlemen, though I was then but a 'prentice, the demand for weapons in the years forty-one and forty-two; sword blades were more in request than toothpicks, and Old Ironsides, my master, took more for rascally Provant rapiers, than I dare ask nowadays for a Toledo. But, to be sure, a man's life then rested on the blade he carried; the Cavaliers and Roundheads fought every day at the gates of Whitehall, as it is like, gentlemen, by your good example, they may do again, when I shall be enabled to leave my pitiful booth, and open a shop of better quality. I hope <b>you</b> will <b>recommend</b> <b>me,</b> gentlemen, to your friends. I am always provided with ware which a gentleman may risk his life on." ...|$|R
6000|$|When Honeyman was ready, the Colonel, {{who had the}} {{greatest}} respect for the Church, would not hear of going {{out of the room}} before the clergyman, and took his arm to walk. Bayham then fell to Mr. Pendennis's lot, and they went together. Through Hill Street and Berkeley Square their course was straight enough; but at Hay Hill, Mr. Bayham made an abrupt tack larboard, engaging in a labyrinth of stables, and walking a long way round from Clifford Street, whither we were bound. He hinted at a cab, but Pendennis refused to ride, being, in truth, anxious to see which way his eccentric companion would steer. [...] "There are reasons," [...] growled Bayham, [...] "which need not be explained to one of your experience, why Bond Street must be avoided by some men peculiarly situated. The smell of Truefitt's pomatum makes me ill. Tell me, Pendennis, is this Indian warrior a rajah of large wealth? <b>Could</b> he, do <b>you</b> think, <b>recommend</b> <b>me</b> to a situation in the East India Company? I would gladly take any honest post in which fidelity might be useful, genius might be appreciated, and courage rewarded. Here we are. The hotel seems comfortable. I never was in it before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Duke of Berwick {{has very}} {{strongly}} <b>recommended</b> <b>you</b> to <b>me,</b> {{saying that you}} had performed excellent service under him, and that he parted with you, with regret, at the express wish of His Majesty. He speaks of you as a young officer, but I was hardly prepared to see one so youthful. He says that you are devoted to your work, active and intelligent as well as brave; and as such your arrival is very welcome to me, for although excellent in battle, I own that my officers are less devoted to the hard work and detail that are as necessary as bravery on a general's staff.|$|R
