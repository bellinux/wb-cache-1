30|$|Omnidirectional {{stereo vision}} {{systems have been}} widely used as primary vision sensors in {{intelligent}} robot 3 D measurement tasks, which require stereo calibration <b>and</b> <b>rectification.</b> Current stereo calibration <b>and</b> <b>rectification</b> methods suffer from complex calculations or a lack of accuracy. This paper establishes a simple and effective equivalency between an omnidirectional stereo vision system and a perspective vision system by studying stereo calibration <b>and</b> <b>rectification</b> methods. First, we improved the stereo calibration method. By applying the essential matrix, the complicated calibration process of the original method is simplified. By using a manual extraction method to extract corner points, noise error is eliminated and high precision is ensured. Second, we propose a new rectification method. By using the proposed simple <b>rectification</b> model <b>and</b> calibration data, the baseline length and an accurate column-aligned image pair are easily obtained, which reduces the computation time. The proposed stereo calibration <b>and</b> <b>rectification</b> method can simply and effectively obtain two key parameters of the triangulation formula for 3 D measurement tasks: baseline length and parallax. Using real data captured by equipment, we performed experiments covering all the necessary stages to obtain a high-performance omnidirectional stereo vision system. Statistical analyses of the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.|$|R

Thermal 1 – 4 and acoustic 5 – 8 rectifiers have been proposed for use in biomedical ultrasound applications 6, 7, thermal computers 2, 9, energy- saving and-harvesting materials 5, 6, and direction-dependent insulating materials 1 – 3. In all these systems the transition between transmission states is smooth with increasing signal amplitudes. This limits their effec-tiveness as switching and logic devices, and reduces their sensitivity to external conditions as sensors. Here we overcome these limitations by demonstrating a new mechanism for tunable rectification that uses bifurcations and chaos. Thi...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Postural {{abnormalities}} {{are often}} found in children. At this stage of life, posture undergoes many adjustments and adaptations due to body changes. Objective: To qualitatively identify the postural abnormalities which occur most frequently among children aged OBJECTIVE: Reven and ten years, comparing boys and girls, and to evaluate these subjects' lumbar flexibility. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-one children were photographed in the sagittal and frontal planes. The variables analyzed were: ankle (valgus and varus), tibiotarsal angle (opened and closed), knee (hyperextension and semiflexion, valgus and varus), pelvis (anteversion and retroversion; lateral pelvic inclination), trunk (antepulsion and retropulsion), lumbar spine (hyperlordosis <b>and</b> <b>rectification),</b> thoracic spine (hyperkyphosis <b>and</b> <b>rectification),</b> cervical spine (hyperlordosis <b>and</b> <b>rectification),</b> scoliosis, shoulder (imbalance and protraction), scapula (winged, abducted and adducted) and head (tilt and protraction). The lumbar flexibility was assessed using Schöber's index. RESULTS: The boys had greater incidence of winged scapula, shoulder imbalance, protraction of shoulders and head and cervical hyperlordosis than the girls did. Conversely, the girls had greater incidence of head tilt and larger Schöber index values. CONCLUSIONS: There were abnormalities in children's postural development that are probably related to muscle, skeletal and flexibility differences between the genders. These differences may influence each child's postural pattern during growth...|$|R

A ratio of the outputs of the first <b>and</b> second <b>rectification</b> <b>and</b> smoothing filters is then used in a generator to generate a gain factor k sub q for the control system to reduce the gain of the output signal of the control system, thereby to provide a damped control output signal without rate limiting the controlled element...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a calibration <b>and</b> <b>rectification</b> method for single-camera range estimation using a single complex image with a transparent plate or a doublesided half-mirror plate, which are collectively called a reflection stereo. The range to an object is obtainable by finding the correspondence on a constraint {{line in the}} complex image, which consists of a surface and a rear-surface reflected image in the transparent plate, or also includes a transmitted and internal reflected image through a double-sided half-mirror plate. The range estimation requires extrinsic parameters of the reflection stereo that include the shape and position of the plate and its refraction index. The proposed method assumes that the plate is non-parallel but planar for a local region around the point {{of interest in the}} complex image. The method estimates the extrinsic parameters from a set of displacements in the complex images.
