40|$|Standardized {{validated}} evaluation {{instruments are}} mandatory {{to increase the}} level of evidence in scar management. Scar assessment scales are potentially suitable for this purpose, but the most appropriate scale {{still needs to be}} determined. This review will elaborate on several clinically relevant scar features and critically discuss the currently available scar scales in terms of basic clinimetric requirements. Many current scales can produce reliable measurements but seem to require multiple observers to obtain these results reliably, which limits their feasibility in clinical practice. The validation process of scar scales is hindered by the lack of a "gold standard" in subjective scar assessment or other reliable objective instruments which are necessary for a good comparison. The authors conclude that there are scar scales available that can reliably measure scar quality. However, further research may lead to improvement of their clinimetric properties and enhance the level of evidence in scar research worldwide.

40|$|Objectives: {{the aim of}} this {{research}} was to investigate whether a training intervention to enhance collaboration between mental health and primary care professionals improved the detection and management of mental health problems in primary health care in four large cities in Brazil. the training intervention was a multifaceted program over 96 h focused on development of a shared care model. Method: A quasiexperimental study design was undertaken with assessment of performance by nurse and general practitioners (GPs) pre- and postintervention. Rates of recognition of mental health disorders (compared with the General Health Questionnaire) were the primary outcome, while self-reports of patient-centered care, psychosocial interventions and referral were the secondary outcomes. Results: Six to 8 months postintervention, no changes were observed in terms of rate of recognition across the entire sample. Nurses significantly increased their recognition rates (from 23 % to 39 %, P=. 05), while GPs demonstrated a significant decrease (from 42 % to 30 %, P=. 04). There were significant increases in reports of patient-centered care, but no changes in other secondary outcomes. Conclusions: Training professionals in a shared care model was not associated with consistent improvements in the recognition or management of mental health problems. Although instabilities in the local context {{may have contributed to the}} lack of effects, wider changes in the system of care may be required to augment training and encourage reliable changes in behavior, and more specific educating models are necessary.

This allows students to put into practice their prior learning in critical analysis of relevant literature while introducing broad principles of research methods and interpretation. We evaluated the research capability of students before and after conducting their research project. Summary of work: Students were guided to design projects relevant to their own and community interests.

40|$|Although {{the effect}} of burns on mental health has been well examined, the aims {{of this study were}} to {{determine}} the prevalence of pre-existing mental health, drug and alcohol, and forensic problems in an Australian burn patient population; examine differences between these groups in terms of burns characteristics and healing; and also establish any patterns of presentation amongst these groups. Retrospective case notes of all the acute burn admissions, 273 patients, into a busy tertiary adults burn center in a full year were reviewed. Almost half of the patients admitted had underlying complex issues. Those with psychotic, forensic, and/or drug and alcohol problems tended to stay longer in hospital and required more procedures, despite burn sizes comparable with those in the general population. These patients also tended to sustain their burn injuries, and present to hospital, on a Saturday, Sunday, or Monday, rarely coming later in the week. Those with depression/anxiety had similar lengths of stay, number of procedures and random temporal presentations to the general burns population. Burn centers should be well staffed and educated in how to deal with patients with complex needs; this staffing should be actively structured to deal with a clear pattern of presentation over the weekend and Monday.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the severity-of-illness score called SCORTEN with respect to its predictive ability and by using data obtained in the RegiSCAR study, the most comprehensive European registry of patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). For advanced comparisons, an auxiliary score (AS) was defined using data obtained in a previous study. Three hundred sixty-nine patients with SJS/TEN were included in RegiSCAR between 2003 and 2005. The data needed for calculation of SCORTEN were available for 45 % of patients. The score revealed a moderate predictive ability with a slight underestimation of the total number of in-hospital deaths by 11 %, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 75, and a Brier score of 0. 14. Problems could be seen by analyzing subgroups such as patients with TEN. The AS was better calibrated but discriminated worse (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0. 72; Brier score: 0. 14). With the help of a refined score derived from SCORTEN and AS, potential for a possible improvement could be demonstrated. The authors were able to show that the predictive ability of SCORTEN is acceptable. Although improvement might be possible, SCORTEN remains the tool of choice, whereas AS might be an alternative in retrospective settings with missing laboratory data.

40|$|This {{study shows}} that the theft of copper, mainly from {{electrical}} wires, is becoming a more frequent crime as {{the value of this}} metal rises. We have collected all the data from the Burn Centre of the Hospital of Palermo, Italy, from 1992 to 2007. Over the last two decades, we assisted to a dramatic increase of patients admitted to our hospital, reporting burn injuries while attempting to steal it in dangerous conditions. The circumstances of the injury, the clinical management of the case, and the long-term consequences are presented and discussed. We found that the electrical burn related to the theft of copper is often a life-threatening event because of the high-voltage electrical current passing through the patients. Patients, due to the type of activity, often requiring physical effort, were generally young and healthy. From {{a review of the literature}} on the subject, we have noticed that theft of copper is not reported as an important risk factor for electrical burns. Our report clearly shows that theft of copper-related electrical injury is becoming more frequent in the community and should be added as a "new" risk factor. The already high incidence reported here may actually be lower than the actual incidence because many patients tend not to come to the hospital because of the risk of being prosecuted by the police.

40|$|Contemporary {{planning}} for disaster response to terrorist events usually assumes {{the use of}} chemical, radiological, or biological weapons. Historically, most victims of terrorist attacks are injured {{by the use of}} conventional explosives rather than weapons of mass destruction. Such attacks will likely produce victims who have suffered burn injuries along with conven-tional trauma. Alternately, the large number of patients sustaining conventional soft-tissue or crush injuries will benefit from burn center expertise. This study summarizes the current state of knowledge related to the management of terrorism mass casualty incidents caused by the use of conventional explosives. A review of pertinent medical, technical, and popular literature relating to terrorism and explosives, along with instruction received at Hadassah Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel on the management of mass casualty terrorism events was under-taken, and the pertinent medical and scientific literature relating to bomb delivery methods, blast mechanics, blast pathophysiology, and medical response to a terrorist bombing is pre-sented here. Although terrorist use of chemical, radiological, or biological weapons is possi-ble, historical analysis consistently demonstrates that the most likely terrorist weapon caus-ing a mass casualty event is a standard explosive device detonated in a crowded area. The medical basis for management of such casualties is herein described. (J Burn <b>Care</b> <b>Re...</b>|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study, {{the authors found}} persistent presence of acute inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein and complement factors locally in burn wounds. This persistence of acute inflammation may not only delay local burn wound healing but also have a systemic effect, for instance on the heart. Here, the effects of C 1 esterase inhibitor (C 1 inh), an inhibitor of complement activation, on burn wound progression and the heart were analyzed in rats. Dorsal full-thickness burn wounds (2 × 4 cm) were induced on female Wistar rats (n = 14). The rats {{were divided into two}} groups (n = 7) : a control group (just burns) and a C 1 inh group. C 1 inh was administered daily intravenously for 14 days. The burn wound, healthy skin from the hind leg (internal control), and the heart were then fixed in formalin. Tissues were analyzed for granulation tissue formation, reepithelialization, amount and type of infiltrating inflammatory cells (granulocytes and macrophages), and inflammatory markers (complement factors C 3 and C 4). C 1 inh treatment significantly reduced the amount of granulation tissue and significantly increased reepithelialization. C 1 inh also significantly reduced macrophage infiltration. Burns induced infiltration of macrophages into the ventricles of the heart and remarkably also into the atria of the heart. This effect could be counteracted by C 1 inh. These data show that systemic treatment with C 1 inh acts at different levels resulting in improved healing locally in burn wounds and systemically reduced inflammation in the heart. Therefore, C 1 inh might be a possible therapeutic intervention for burn wound patients. (J Burn <b>Care</b> <b>Res</b> 2012; 33 : 544 - 551). © 2012 by the American Burn Association...|$|E

In a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study, 32 patients were randomized as no supplementation (n = 15) or antioxidant supplementation (n = 17) groups. Supplementation consisted of the antioxidant mixture of vitamin C (1. 5 times upper intake level), vitamin E (1. 35 times upper intake level), and zinc (2. 0 times recommended dietary allowance) administered during 7 days starting on the second day of admittance into the hospital. Energy requirement was calculated by the Curreri equation, and protein input was 3. 0 g/kg of ideal body mass index (percentile 50 degrees). Total antioxidant capacity of plasma and malondialdehyde were used to monitor oxidative stress. The time of wound healing was evaluated as the main clinical feature. Patients (age 54. 2 +/- 48. 9 months, 65. 6 % males), who exhibited 15. 5 +/- 6. 7 % of total burn area, showed no differences in age and sex, when compared with controls. Intake of the administered antioxidants was obviously higher in treated subjects (P =. 005), and serum differences were confirmed for vitamin E and C, but not for zinc (P =. 180). There was a decrease in lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde level) (P =. 006) and an increase in vitamin E concentrations in the antioxidant supplementation group (P =. 016). The time of wound healing was lower in the supplemented group (P <. 001). The antioxidant supplementation through vitamin E and C and the mineral zinc apparently enhanced antioxidant protection against oxidative stress and allowed less time for wound healing.

40|$|Background: Maternal {{mortality}} {{has declined}} by nearly half since 1990, but {{over a quarter}} million women still die every year of causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. Maternal-health related targets are falling short of the 2015 Millennium Development Goals and a post- 2015 Development Agenda is emerging. in connection with this, setting global research priorities {{for the next decade}} is now required. Methods: We adapted the methods of the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) to identify and set global research priorities for maternal and perinatal health for the period 2015 to 2025. Priority research questions were received from various international stakeholders constituting a large reference group, and consolidated into a final list of research questions by a technical working group. Questions on this list were then scored by the reference working group according to five independent and equally weighted criteria. Normalized research priority scores (NRPS) were calculated, and research priority questions were ranked accordingly. Results: A list of 190 priority research questions for improving maternal and perinatal health was scored by 140 stakeholders. Most priority research questions (89 %) were concerned with the evaluation of implementation and delivery of existing interventions, with research subthemes frequently concerned with training and/or awareness interventions (11 %), and access to interventions and/or services (14 %). Twenty-one questions (11 %) involved the discovery of new interventions or technologies. Conclusions: Key research priorities in maternal and perinatal health were identified. the resulting ranked list of research questions provides a valuable resource for health research investors, researchers and other stakeholders. We are hopeful that this exercise will inform the post- 2015 Development Agenda and assist donors, research-policy decision makers and researchers to invest in research that will ultimately make the most significant {{difference in the lives of}} mothers and babies.

Twenty-one patients (40 limbs), mean age of 45 years, were treated for fourth-degree lower-extremity burns with the average extremity burn size of 24 % TBSA (range, 2 – 36 %) and a mean fourth-degree burn size of 9 % TBSA (range, 2 – 18 %). A mean of eight operations were required for limb salvage. Six free-tissue transfers, 2 fillet flaps, 14 local flaps, and multiple skin grafts were performed. Five patients underwent tibial burring for granulation tissue stimulation, and the subatmospheric pressure device was used in eight patients. Seven limb amputations (18 %) were required in four patients, and 76 % of patients were ambulatory on follow-up.

The {{aim of this}} retrospective cohort {{study was to determine the}} {{intensive care}} unit costs for burn patients compared with nonburn patients matched for length of stay and severity of illness. The patient record was reviewed to compare costs associated with expendables (medications and fluids), investigations (laboratory and radiological tests), and physiotherapy sessions in 13 burn patients and 13 nonburn controls. Medical and nursing staff costs could not be differentially determined between groups. The cost of wound dressings were estimated for burn patients. The mean daily cost of burn patients was Australian dollars (AUD) 700. 74 and AUD 697. 99 for nonburn controls (P =. 97), with an additional AUD 1411 estimated for nursing and medical staffing. There was no significant difference in the cost of expendables or laboratory tests between the groups. The largest drug and laboratory costs in both cases and controls were attributed to the use of meropenem and intravenous antifungals (25 % and 30 %, respectively) and arterial blood gas analysis (31 % and 27 %, respectively). Analgesics, anxiolytics, and sedatives costed AUD 21. 58 more per day in burn patients than in controls (P =. 054). Physiotherapy costs were AUD 18. 62 higher per day in burn patients (P =. 028), whereas radiology costs were AUD 108. 10 higher in the control group (P =. 001). Burn dressings costed AUD 120. 77 per day. The authors found no significant difference in the mean daily intensive care unit cost of burn patients compared with controls matched for length of stay and acuity. However, physiotherapy and dressing costs were higher in burn patients, and there was a trend to increase costs associated with analgesic/anxiolytic/sedative medications. Antimicrobials accounted for a significant proportion of pharmacy costs in both groups. (J Burn <b>Care</b> <b>Res</b> 2010; 31 : 598 - 602...|$|E
40|$|The {{forthcoming}} post-Millennium Development Goals era {{will bring}} about new challenges in global health. Low- and middle-income countries will {{have to contend with}} a dual burden of infectious and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Some of these NCDs, such as neoplasms, COPD, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, cause much health loss worldwide and are already widely recognised as doing so. However, 55 % of the global NCD burden arises from other NCDs, which tend to be ignored in terms of premature mortality and quality of life reduction. Here, experts in some of these 'forgotten NCDs' review the clinical impact of these diseases along with the consequences of their ignoring their medical importance, and discuss ways in which they can be given higher global health priority in order to decrease the growing burden of disease and disability.

40|$|Objective. To reexamine the {{cost-effectiveness}} of misoprostol, {{using data}} from a recently published placebo-controlled trial of misoprostol in > 8, 000 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (the Misoprostol Ulcer Complications Outcome Safety Assessment [MUCOSA] study). Methods. Actual clinical events and the rates of endoscopies and upper gastrointestinal (GI) radiographic series, hospitalizations, and surgery for these events were derived from the MUCOSA study and used in a decision analysis. Estimates of costs {{for the management of}} these events were derived from the Ontario Case Cost Project database and published economic evaluations; cases were adjusted to 1994 Canadian dollars. Incremental cost-effectiveness (from the viewpoint of the provincial health care plan in Canada) was calculated for the original trial population (risk of a serious GI complication 1 %) and for the subsets of patients with medium (3 %) and high (6 %) risk. Results. for the original study population, averting 1 serious GI complication by prescribing misoprostol would cost an additional $ 94, 766 (Canadian; range $ 60, 266 - 137, 146). for patients with previous peptic ulcer disease (medium risk), the cost would be $ 14, 943 (range $ 10, 912 - 32, 157), and for patients with previous peptic ulcer disease and age > 75 (high risk), the cost would be $ 4, 101 (range $- 220 to $ 18, 146). Conclusion. Prescribing misoprostol for all patients with RA who are {{greater than or equal to}} 52 years old costs $ 94, 766 for each additional GI event averted. However, when patients at higher risk are specifically selected, the cost per averted GI complication is markedly reduced. These results, based on actual serious event rates and actual data on endoscopies and upper GI series, hospitalizations, and surgeries, provide a better estimate of the true cost-effectiveness of misoprostol than previous analyses based on endoscopic data and modeling of all resource utilizations.

40|$|Background: {{hospitalization}} for Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (AC SC), {{also known}} as avoidable hospitalization (AH) has been proposed as effect measure of the accessibility and effectiveness of primary care. In the last years in developed countries, including Italy, hospitalization rates have decreased {{as well as the}} rates of AH. The decline of AH-rates could be just an effect of the general trend of hospitalization. The objective of our {{study was to examine the}} adjusted trend of AH rates and to test possible associations with measures of primary <b>care</b> (<b>re)</b> organization. Methods: hospital discharges from 2001 to 2008 were analyzed. Main outcome measures were hospitalization rates, both as inpatient and day hospital. ACSCs were grouped in acute conditions, preventable through early diagnoses and treatment and chronic conditions, preventable through good ongoing control and management. Expected time-series rates of AH, estimated on the hypothesis of same time trends of Total Hospitalization (TH), were compared with observed ones using a Chi Square test. Adjusted hospitalization rates were analyzed in conjunction with indicators of primary care. Results: in the studied period, in Italy, the TH rates declined with an average decrease of 19. 6 %, while the decrease for AH was 16. 4 %. The rates of AH adjusted for the trend of TH significantly decreased only for chronic conditions. Decreasing trend of AH was correlated with the impact of reorganization of primary care in associative forms. Conclusions: the presented methodology can be used to evaluate the real effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing hospitalization for ACSCs. </p...|$|R
