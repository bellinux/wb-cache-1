5|$|Mouton {{debuted in}} {{rallying}} as a co-driver but quickly {{moved to the}} driver's seat, steering an Alpine-Renault A110 in national rallies. In 1975, she competed in circuit racing and won the two-litre prototype class in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. After being signed by Fiat France for 1977, Mouton finished runner-up to Bernard Darniche in the European Rally Championship. She {{went on to win}} the 1978 Tour de France Automobile and record <b>consistent</b> <b>results</b> in her home events in the WRC; the Tour de Corse and the Monte Carlo Rally. For 1981, Audi Sport signed Mouton to partner Hannu Mikkola. In her first year with the Audi Quattro, she took a surprise victory at the Rallye Sanremo.|$|E
5|$|It {{was clear}} from the {{beginning}} of the CryoSat programme that an extensive series of measurements would be needed, both to understand interaction of the radar waves with the surface of the ice caps and to relate the measured freeboard of floating sea ice with its thickness. This latter, in particular, would have to take account of snow loading. For sea ice, which moves as it is blown by the wind, it was also necessary to develop techniques which could give <b>consistent</b> <b>results</b> when measured from platforms travelling at different speed (scientists on the surface, helicopter-towed sounders, aircraft-borne radars and CryoSat itself). A number of campaigns were performed under a programme called CRYOVEX which aimed to address each of the identified areas of uncertainty. These campaigns continued through the development of the original CryoSat and were planned to continue after its launch.|$|E
5|$|Jimmy Calderwood {{took over}} in 2004 and Aberdeen posted more <b>consistent</b> <b>results</b> than in {{previous}} seasons. In the 2006–07 season, the club finished in third place {{in the league and}} entered the final qualifying round for the 2007–08 UEFA Cup. Aberdeen defeated Dnipro on the away goals rule to progress (the first time Aberdeen had won on away goals in European football for 40 years). They went on to beat F.C. Copenhagen 4–0, which was the biggest margin of victory and one of Pittodrie's biggest crowds since the 1980s. This set up a meeting with German giants Bayern Munich, which they lost 7–3 on aggregate after a 2–2 draw which saw Aberdeen lead twice in the first leg. Calderwood was sacked by Aberdeen on 24 May 2009, hours after he took the club to a fourth-place finish and back into Europe. Poor domestic cup performances were thought to be the reason for Calderwood's dismissal.|$|E

40|$|We analyze {{voting on}} {{subsidies}} for professional sports facilities in Harris County (Houston), Texas and Brown County (Green Bay), Wisconsin {{to learn more}} about voter preferences for these subsidies. The results di®er somewhat between the two jurisdictions, as do the nature of the supports being proposed and the communities. One <b>consistent</b> <b>result</b> is that voting precincts that have a relatively high degree of poverty tend to oppose subsidies for professional sports. Another <b>consistent</b> <b>result</b> is that voters in close proximity to existing facilities are more likely to favor subsidies than are voters living farther from the facilities. In Harris County, the results consistently indicate that those over 65 years of age, whites, and those with Bachelors degrees statistically signi¯cantly oppose subsidies while those with higher incomes and blacks favor the subsidies. Di®erent values of consumption bene¯ts, stemming from di®erences in preferences, may explain these voting patterns...|$|R

25|$|Windows Vista also {{features}} an enhanced file content search for non-indexed locations, whereby the files being scanned are processed {{by the same}} IFilters {{that would be used}} for indexing, therefore offering more <b>consistent</b> <b>results</b> between indexed and non-indexed searches as well as the ability for third parties to add support for additional file formats to have their content searched.|$|E
25|$|Rabin dismisses these criticisms, {{claiming}} that <b>consistent</b> <b>results</b> are typically obtained in multiple situations and geographies and can produce good theoretical insight. Behavioral economists have also responded to these criticisms {{by focusing on}} field studies rather than lab experiments. Some economists see a fundamental schism between experimental economics and behavioral economics, but prominent behavioral and experimental economists tend to share techniques and approaches in answering common questions. For example, behavioral economists are investigating neuroeconomics, which is entirely experimental and cannot yet be verified in the field.|$|E
25|$|Windows Search is the indexed search {{platform}} in Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008, {{and offers a}} superset of the features provided by Windows Desktop Search, while being API compatible with it. Unlike WDS, it can seamlessly search indexed as well as non-indexed locations – for indexed locations the index is used and for non-indexed locations, the property handlers and IFilters are invoked on the fly as the search is being performed. This allows for more <b>consistent</b> <b>results,</b> though {{at the cost of}} searching speed over non-indexed locations. Windows Search uses Group Policy for centralized management.|$|E

Studies of the pathophysiologic mechanisms for the increased risk of Venous thrombosis embolism or VTE after long-distance travel have not produced <b>consistent</b> <b>results,</b> but venous stasis appears to play a major role; other factors specific to air travel may increase coagulation activation, particularly in passengers with individual risk factors for VTE.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Coulthard {{remained}} at McLaren {{and continued to}} be parterned by Häkkinen. The season started controversially in Australia for the McLaren team when Coulthard, who was leading let Häkkinen past to win the race. Coulthard later revealed an pre-race agreement by the team that whoever led into the first corner on the first lap {{would be allowed to}} win the race. However, the race marked a run of <b>consistent</b> <b>results,</b> with Coulthard scoring three further podiums, including victory in San Marino. Coulthard retired from three out of the next four races, and followed this up by taking a further five podiums during the remainder of the season, including a retirement in Italy.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Hingis again {{found herself}} in both the singles and doubles finals at the Australian Open. This time, however, she lost both. Her three-year hold on the singles {{championship}} ended when she lost to Davenport. Later, Hingis and Mary Pierce, her new doubles partner, lost to Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs. Hingis captured the French Open women's doubles title with Pierce and produced <b>consistent</b> <b>results</b> in singles tournaments throughout the year. She reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon before losing to Venus Williams. Although she did not win a Grand Slam singles tournament, she kept the year end No. 1 ranking because of nine tournament championships, including the WTA Tour Championships where she won the singles and doubles titles.|$|E

25|$|The {{physical}} exam includes a systematic {{examination of the}} whole patient to assess general health and to look for signs of associated conditions and metastatic disease. The neck and supraclavicular fossa are palpated to feel for cervical adenopathy, other masses, and laryngeal crepitus. The oral cavity and oropharynx are examined under direct vision. The larynx may be examined by indirect laryngoscopy using a small angled mirror with a long handle (akin to a dentist's mirror) and a strong light. Indirect laryngoscopy can be highly effective, but requires skill and practice for <b>consistent</b> <b>results.</b> For this reason, many specialist clinics now use fibre-optic nasal endoscopy where a thin and flexible endoscope, inserted through the nostril, is used to clearly visualise the entire pharynx and larynx. Nasal endoscopy is a quick and easy procedure performed in clinic. Local anaesthetic spray may be used.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 Söderling {{made it to}} {{the round}} of 32 at Wimbledon, where he lost to Rafael Nadal in a five-set match. He caused much {{controversy}} on the court when he exchanged mocking behaviour with Nadal, tugging on his shorts in the manner Nadal is known for after growing tired of Nadal's slow play {{at the beginning of the}} 5th. Söderling did not make it to an ATP final for the first time in five years in 2007, however he turned out <b>consistent</b> <b>results</b> throughout the year. He missed the last 3 months of the main tour due to a left wrist injury. Söderling missed the Australian Open due to injury. The first tournament he entered in 2007 was the Open 13 Marseille, where he reached the quarterfinals. He then reached the final of the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament (Rotterdam), finishing runner-up to Michaël Llodra in the final, 7–6, 2–6, 6–3. The next week he reached another final at the Regions Morgan Keegan Championships in Memphis, U.S. He beat top seed Andy Roddick in the tournament along the way to the final.
