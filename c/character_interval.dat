40|$|Regular {{expression}} matching {{is a key}} task (and often computational bottleneck) in {{a variety}} of software tools and applications. For instance, the standard grep and sed utilities, scripting languages such as perl, internet traffic analysis, XML querying, and protein searching. The basic definition of a regular expression is that we combine characters with union, concatenation, and kleene star operators. The length m is proportional to the number of characters. However, often the initial operation is to concatenate characters in fairly long strings, e. g., if we search for certain combinations of words in a firewall. As a result, the number k of strings in the regular expression is significantly smaller than m. Our main result is a new algorithm that essentially replaces m with k in the complexity bounds for regular expression matching. More precisely, after an O(m log k) time and O(m) space preprocessing of the expression, we can match it in a string presented as a stream log w of characters in O(k w + log k) time per character, where w is the number of bits in a memory word. For large w, this corresponds to the previous best bound log w of O(m w + log m). Prior to this work no O(k) bound per character was known. We further extend our solution to efficiently handle <b>character</b> class <b>interval</b> operators C{x, y}. Here, C is a set of characters and C{x, y}, where x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x ≤ y, represents a string of length between x and y from C.

In several species of anurans, females exert {{stabilizing}} or weakly directional preferences on less variable call properties, and highly di-rectional preferences on more variable ones. Preferences of female túngara frogs, Physalaemus pustulosus, were examined for two call characteristics: a less variable spec-tral character, dominant frequency of the whine, and a more variable temporal <b>character,</b> inter-call <b>interval.</b> Eight phonotaxis experiments using synthetic calls were con-ducted with gravid females. Stimuli presented for both characters were based on the mean and standard deviation (SD) of those characters in the study population. For each character, we used four intervals of variation (1, 2, 3, and 4 SD) between stimuli in four different experiments. As has been found in some other anuran species, preference was stronger for the more variable temporal character, in-creasing in proportion to the difference between stimuli. Preference for the less variable spectral character was not significant until the difference between stimuli was sub-stantial. The strength of female preference, estimated as latency to choose, the number of speakers visited, and the number of females showing phonotaxis, increased in pro-portion to the increase in the difference between stimuli.

It is shown that the functional environment stochastic nature is generated {{by a factor of}} <b>interval</b> <b>character</b> of human operator properties. Method. The problem is solved in the class of regular (recurrent) finite Markov chains with three states of the human operator: with a favorable, median and unfavorable combination of the values of mathematical model parameters of the human operator in a quasi-static functional environment. The finite Markov chain is designed taking into account the factors of human operator tiredness and <b>interval</b> <b>character</b> of parameters of the model representation of his properties. The device is based on the usage of mathematical approximation of the standard curve of the human operator activity performance during work shift. The standard curve of the human operator activity performance is based on the extensive research experience of functional activity of the human operator with the help of photos of the day, his action timing and ergonomic generalizations. Main Results. The apparatus of regular finite Markov chains gave the possibility to evaluate correctly the human operator activity performance in a quasi-static functional environment {{with the use of the}} main information component of these chains as a vector of final probabilities. In addition, we managed to build an algorithmic basis for estimating the stationary time (time study for transit of human operator from arbitrary initial functional state into a state corresponding to a vector of final probabilities) for a used chain after it reaches the final state based on the analysis of the eigenvalues spectrum of the matrix of transition probabilities for a regular (recurrent) finite Markov chain. Practical Relevance. Obtained theoretical results are confirmed by illustrative examples, which demonstrate their suitability for possible use in the organization of the quasi-static and functional environment to solve {{the problems of}} its perfection.

Other pulse characters (pulse length and cycle number) may also aect female mate choice, whereas pulse train <b>characters</b> (interpulse <b>interval,</b> pulse number and pulse train length) are not associated with these male fitness components. Inbreeding depression in these song characters was investigated by comparing the songs of inbred and outbred fly strains. The average change in most song characters {{as a result of}} inbreeding was only a few percent. However, in male song frequency the average inbreeding depression was about 14 %, suggesting that this song character is associated with fitness. Outbreeding depression and the genetic architecture of song characters were investigated with interpopulation crosses and joint scaling tests. For pulse train characters the generation means show only evidence of additivity, and the existence of dominance or epistasis in these characters was strongly rejected in each case. In pulse characters the means of the F 1 males were lower than the average of the parental generations. In pulse length and cycle number this dierence was attributable to dominance alone. In frequency there was outbreeding depression also in the F 2 generation, suggesting a break-up of favourable epistatic gene combinations. The outbreeding depression in this character in the F 1 generation was caused by dominance, and in the F 2 also by duplicate epistasis between dominant decreasers.

Because of its extreme <b>character,</b> this <b>interval</b> has been considered an analog {{for the next century}} of climate change. The Bering Sea is ideally situated to record how opening or closing of the Pacific–Arctic Ocean gateway (Bering Strait) impacted primary productivity, sea ice, and sediment transport in the past; however, little is known about this region prior to 125  ka. IODP Expedition 323 to the Bering Sea offered the unparalleled opportunity to look in detail at time periods older than had been previously retrieved using gravity and piston cores. Here we present a multi-proxy record for Marine Isotope Stages 12 to 10 from Site U 1345, located near the continental shelf-slope break. MIS 11 is bracketed by highly productive laminated intervals that may have been triggered by flooding of the Beringian shelf. Although sea ice is reduced during the early MIS 11 laminations, it remains present at the site throughout both glacials and MIS 11. High summer insolation is associated with higher productivity but colder sea surface temperatures, which implies that productivity was likely driven by increased upwelling. Multiple examples of Pacific–Atlantic teleconnections are presented including laminations deposited at the end of MIS 11 in synchrony with millennial-scale expansions in sea ice in the Bering Sea and stadial events seen in the North Atlantic. When global eustatic sea level was at its peak, a series of anomalous conditions are seen at U 1345.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} arrivals {{at an airport}} is a major {{influence}} on the efficiency of runway operations. The desired distribution of landing time intervals will depend on the runway configuration and the mix of aircraft types but will nevertheless be as regular as possible. A purely random arrival stream has an exponential distribution of intervals between arrivals, so the exponential distribution is a meaningful benchmark against which to measure the disorder of the stream. We examined data on all arrivals to nine major US airports during December 2003 for evidence of exponentiality in the distribution of estimated times of arrival as estimated when the aircraft were 100 miles from their destinations. Testing for exponentiality in projected interarrival times is {{complicated by the fact that}} arrival rates vary substantially over time. We analyzed the data two ways to neutralize this complication. First, we divided the data at each airport into hour-by-dayof-week subsets and computed two summary statistics related to the shape of the distribution: the coefficient of variation and the coefficient of skewness. Second, we developed a new methodology that allowed pooling of all interval data for estimation of the shape parameter of a Weibull distribution, of which the exponential is a special case with shape parameter unity. This method requires only the assumption that the mean interval changes relatively slowly, so that successive intervals can be regarded as having the same average value. Both these analyses confirmed the nearly-exponential <b>character</b> of the <b>intervals</b> between projected ETAs. This means that the combination of the schedules set by the airlines and the handling of aircraft by en route air traffic controllers results in an arrival stream that is close to random as the aircraft near their destination. This places a burden on the controllers who handle arrivals in the final 100 miles of their flights. ...|$|R
