40|$|To {{conserve}} {{and study}} the existing genetic resources of <b>colonial</b> <b>bentgrass</b> for use in breeding, genetic diversity was investigated using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Ten EcoRI/MseI and six PstI/MseI AFLP primer combinations produced 181 and 128 informative polymorphic bands, respectively. Cluster analysis of genetic similarity estimates revealed {{a high level of}} diversity in <b>colonial</b> <b>bentgrass</b> species with averages of 0. 51 (EcoRI/MseI) and 0. 63 (PstI/MseI). Greater genetic diversity was detected by the EcoRI/MseI AFLP primer combinations. A significant positive correlation (r= 0. 44, p= 0. 0099) between the two Jaccard similarity matrices from EcoRI/MseI and PstI/MseI enzyme combinations was obtained by the Mantel test.

40|$|<b>Colonial</b> <b>bentgrass</b> (Agrostis capillaris L.) is a cool-season {{perennial}} grass. It is {{of great}} importance because it is adapted to fairways and tees of golf courses, and it has good low temperature hardiness and medium shade tolerance. Rough bluegrass (Poa trivialis L.) is a cool-season grass grown for sports fields, home lawns, and also winter overseeding on warm-season turf in southern United States. Our objective was to analyze genetic variation among each 27 accessions of rough bluegrass and <b>colonial</b> <b>bentgrass</b> by using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. For <b>colonial</b> <b>bentgrass,</b> the Jaccard 2 ̆ 7 s similarity coefficients ranged from 0. 13 to 0. 72 based on RAPD data. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) dendrogram clearly separated 26 out of 27 accessions into 3 clusters. A high cophenetic correlation coefficient (r = 0. 82) indicated a good fit between the RAPD data matrix and cophenetic matrix. For rough bluegrass, the Jaccard 2 ̆ 7 s similarity coefficients ranged from 0. 07 to 0. 74 based on RAPD data. The UPGMA dendrogram revealed that 26 out of 27 accessions were clustered in 4 different clusters. The cophenetic correlation (r) value of 0. 90 indicated a very good fit between data matrix and the cluster analysis. The clustering patterns of principal components analysis (PCA) corresponded well with the dendrograms in both <b>colonial</b> <b>bentgrass</b> and rough bluegrass. Since there was no similarity coefficient value close to one between any two accessions there was no duplication of accessions in <b>colonial</b> <b>bentgrass</b> and rough bluegrass germplasm collection...|$|E

40|$|Water {{is a basic}} {{necessity}} for turfgrass growth and metabolic processes, with optimal levels required {{for the maintenance of}} turf quality and function. As water restrictions for irrigation of landscapes become more widespread across the United States, turfgrass managers will need to rely on management strategies to improve the performance of turfgrasses under reduced irrigation environments. Therefore, the objectives of the research were to (i) compare the performance of different Agrostis species and cultivars under reduced irrigation, (ii) evaluate the use of wetting agents for maintaining turf quality under reduced irrigation, (iii) and examine the physiological mechanisms associated with improved drought resistance traits of Agrostis species. To address our primary objectives, we conducted a two-year field study comparing cultivars of three bentgrass species, including ‘Revere’ and ‘Tiger II’ colonial bentgrasses (Agrostis capillaris), ‘Legendary’ and ‘Greenwich’ velvet bentgrasses (A. canina), and ‘ 13 M’, ‘T- 1 ’, ‘L- 93 ’, and ‘Penncross’ creeping bentgrasses (A. stolonifera) in response to reduced irrigation with and without the use of a wetting agent. In general, the use of a wetting agent did not result in any significant differences in turf quality or soil moisture content among treatments. There were significant differences in turf quality among bentgrass species and cultivars under reduced irrigation. <b>Colonial</b> <b>bentgrass</b> cultivars maintained high turf quality, and were found to be well suited for fairways under reduced irrigation. Due to excessive thatch accumulation in our study, velvet bentgrass cultivars exhibited significant declines in quality regardless of irrigation level. Among creeping bentgrass cultivars, T- 1 exhibited improved drought tolerance compared to the older cultivars of creeping bentgrass. Based on results from the field study, we further evaluated the drought resistance and recovery characteristics among five cultivars of <b>colonial</b> <b>bentgrass</b> (‘Barking’, 2 ̆ 7 Tiger II’, ‘Revere’, ‘Capri’, and ‘Greentime’). Under moderate drought stress, Barking, Tiger II, and Revere all exhibited lower leaf relative water content levels compared to Capri and Greentime, although no significant differences in turf quality or soil water content were observed during the drought period. Following re-watering, Barking and Tiger II exhibited the most rapid recovery from drought (as measured by percent green cover), while Capri and Greentime exhibited delayed recovery. Therefore, although significant differences in turf performance during drought stress were not observed, recovery potential seems to vary among the different cultivars of <b>colonial</b> <b>bentgrass...</b>|$|E

Dehardening resistance and rehardening capacity are important traits for survival of low freezing temperatures following warm spells during winter and early spring. Our {{objective was to}} determine plant hardiness {{at the start of}} winter and dehardening resistance of six cool-season turfgrass species/subspecies commonly used on golf greens. Plant material was collected on an experimental green at Bioforsk Landvik, SE Norway in late November 2011 and 2012 and subjected to six or twelve days of dehardening at 10 °C in a growth chamber. The ranking order for freezing tolerance (measured as lethal temperature for 50 % plants (LT 50)) of turfgrasses taken from the field in late November was: annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.) (− 13 to − 14 °C) < <b>colonial</b> <b>bentgrass</b> (Agrostis capillaris L.) (− 18 to − 20 °C) ≤ slender creeping fescue (Festuca rubra trichophylla L.) (− 19 °C) ≤ chewings fescue (Festuca rubra commutate L.) (− 21 °C) < velvet bentgrass (Agrostis canina L.) (− 23 to − 27 °C) ≤ creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) (<− 30 °C). The main dehardening occurred during the first 6 days at 10 °C and dehardening rates increased in the order: slender creeping fescue < chewings fescue < <b>colonial</b> <b>bentgrass</b> < annual bluegrass < creeping bentgrass. The dehardening rate of velvet bentgrass was inconsistent in the two years. An additional rehardening treatment at 2 °C for 23 days was included in 2012. None of the species were able to reharden to their original freezing tolerance after 12 -d dehardening at 10 °C. Low overall freezing resistance and less capacity to reharden in annual bluegrass than in the other species was associated with more leaf growth during both hardening and dehardening. The results indicate that hardening ability and dehardening resistance are not necessarily positively correlated and that the turfgrasses studied have developed different strategies to survive the winter...|$|E
40|$|Urban {{populations of}} Canada geese (Branta canadensis) cause {{considerable}} problems when large numbers congregate in parks, playing fields, and backyards. In most cases, geese {{are drawn to}} these sites to feed on the lawns. I tested whether geese have feeding preferences for different grass species. Captive Canada geese preferred Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) and disliked tall fescue (Festuca arundinaceae) over <b>colonial</b> <b>bentgrass</b> (Agrostis tenuis cv. Highland), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), and red fescue (Festuca rubra). They refused to eat some other ground covers such as pachysandra (Pachysandra terminalis) and English ivy (Hedera helix). These results suggest that goose numbers at problem sites could be reduced by changing the ground cover. I also compared the characteristics of foraging sites used by geese to other foraging sites that geese avoided. Occupied sites were more open so that geese had clearer visibility and greater ease in taking off and landing.

Tree densities, distributions of tree diameters and heights, amount of regeneration for each tree species, evidence of exogenous disturbances, and cover of vascular understorey species were determined for the 22 largest communities. Basal areas, species richness and diversity of vascular plants, and percentages of exotic species were calculated for the study sites. Results showed that oak communities were typically more diverse than either Douglas fir forests or prairies and were transitional in species composition between them.

Two members, <b>colonial</b> <b>bentgrass</b> (Agrostis capillaris L.) and creeping bentgrass (A. stolonifera L.) have only recently been domesticated and provide an interesting case of polyploidy and comparison to crops that have undergone human selection for thousands of years.

Sampling mRNA from plants subjected to environmental stress showed a remarkable increase in transcription of transposable elements. Both colonial and creeping bentgrass are allotetraploids and are considered to have one genome in common, designated the A 2 genome. Analysis of conserved genes present among the ESTs suggests the colonial and creeping bentgrass A 2 genomes diverged from a common ancestor approximately 2. 2 million years ago (MYA), thereby providing an enhanced evolutionary zoom in respect to the origin of maize, which formed 4. 8 MYA, and tetraploid wheat, which formed only 0. 5 MYA and is the progenitor of domesticated hexaploid wheat...|$|E

The presence and nature of sequence related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) at the cDNA level were investigated. We isolated 80 unique cDNA fragment bands from these species using 56 SRAP primer combinations. Sequence analysis of cDNA clones and analysis of putative translation products revealed that some encoded amino acid sequences were similar to proteins involved in DNA synthesis, transcription, and signal transduction. The cytosolic glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene (GenBank accession no. EB 812822) was also identified from velvet bentgrass, and the corresponding protein sequence is further analyzed due to its critical role in many cellular processes. The partial peptide sequence obtained was 112 amino acids long, presenting a high degree of homology to parts of the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of cytosolic phosphorylating GAPDH (GapC).

The objective of this study was to identify and clone constitutively expressed cDNAs encoding R gene-like (RGL) sequences from three Agrostis species (<b>colonial</b> <b>bentgrass</b> (A. capillaris L.), creeping bentgrass (A. stolonifera L.) and velvet bentgrass (A. canina L.)) by PCR-based motif-directed RNA fingerprinting towards relatively conserved nucleotide binding site (NBS) domains. Sixty-one constitutively expressed cDNA sequences were identified and characterized. Sequence analysis of ESTs and probable translation products revealed that RGLs are highly conserved among these three Agrostis species. Fifteen of them were shown to share conserved motifs found in other plant disease resistance genes such as MLA 13, Xa 1, YR 6, YR 23 and RPP 5. The molecular evolutionary forces, analysed using the Ka/Ks ratio, reflected purifying selection both on NBS and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) intervening regions of discovered RGL sequences in these species. This study presents, for the first time, isolation and characterization of constitutively expressed RGL sequences from Agrostis species revealing the presence of TNL (TIR-NBS-LRR) type R genes in monocot plants.

Each October from 1990 - 92, nylon mesh pouches, each containing 10 galls, were buried in the field or placed on the soil surface in microplots. Pouches were collected monthly or bimonthly between December and June and nematodes per gall counted. Nematode egression from galls began in late March and was completed by mid-May, corresponding to the period of floral initiation in bentgrass. In 1991 and 1992, 0. 09 -m² plots were inoculated with 0, 1, 5, 15, 50, 120, or 200 galls/plot. The disease severity (number of galls) and disease incidence (% seed heads with galls) increased linearly at inoculum densities below 50 galls/ plot. At higher inoculum densities, disease increase approached an asymptote. In 1991, plots were established to determine the characteristics of disease spread. Disease foci were established by placing 0, 5, 50, or 500 galls along 30 -cm sections of row in the fall. In July 1992, seed heads were harvested at 30 and 60 cm from each focus within and across plant rows. Most infestations were found within 30 cm of foci at all inoculum levels.

40|$|As an {{essential}} component, Zinc (Zn) {{is required for}} the proper growth and functioning of plants. Belonging to the Poaceae family of grasses, characterization of Agrostis species in terms of Zn content and growth under low-Zn supply will not only enable {{a deeper understanding of the}} molecular mechanisms of metal homeostasis of these grass species but also contribute to the global efforts of micronutrient fortification in related grasses of great agronomic importance, such as barley and wheat. In this study, three Agrostis species, Creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera), <b>Colonial</b> <b>bentgrass</b> (Agrostis capillaries), and Velvet bentgrass (Agrostis canina), were analyzed for seed Zn content and the effects of Zn deficiency on growth. Although Velvet bentgrass exhibited the highest Zn levels in seeds, Creeping bentgrass was concluded to be the most tolerant variety to Zn deficiency. To explore differentially expressed genes under Zn deficiency, mRNA differential display approach was applied, which revealed six, one, and two differentially expressed genes in Creeping, Colonial, and Velvet bentgrasses, respectively. One of the differentially expressed genes in Creeping bentgrass was found to be significantly downregulated in response to Zn deficiency both under tissue culture and greenhouse conditions. Further analysis of this gene through rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) revealed that the full-length gene exhibited extensive homology to the zinc transporter ZIP 3 identified in Oryza sativa. These results suggest that conserved mechanisms may play a role in tolerance against Zn deficiency in some Agrostis species.

Methiozolin was applied 7 weeks after seeding followed by a second application at 12 weeks. Methiozolin rates that produced 25 % injury (TI 25) and 50 % clipping dry weight reduction relative to an untreated control for each species or cultivar (GR 50) were calculated using four parameter logistic regression. Results indicated that TI 25 rates at 56 DAIT were the most accurate in describing relative tolerance among BG species; as a result CRBG {{was determined to be}} more tolerant to methiozolin than VBG or COBG. Respective TI 25 rates were 1. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 3 kg ai ha - 1 for CRBG, VBG and COBG. Furthermore, VBG and COBG are unlikely to tolerate sequential applications necessary to control annual bluegrass with methiozolin. Evidence of soil residual activity was documented for methiozolin; therefore, herbicide rates that caused TI 25 and GR 50 decreased with increasing number of applications. Creeping bentgrass `Penn A- 4 ' was the most tolerant of methiozolin application with TI 25 of 4. 5 and 2. 5 kg ai ha - 1 at 28 and 56 DAIT, respectively.

40|$|In recent years, {{non-migratory}} {{flocks of}} Canada Geese have become established in some {{urban and suburban}} areas. These birds often become a serious nuisance when they litter backyards, parks and beaches with fecal material, creating a potential health hazard especially for young children. To determine {{the scope of the}} problem, I surveyed golf course managers in the eastern U. S. to see if they were experiencing a problem with geese. This survey showed that this problem was widespread, occurring throughout the eastern U. S., and appeared to be increasing. Twenty-six percent of all respondents reported nuisance goose problems and were willing to spend an average of $ 444 /year to be rid of the geese. Unfortunately, there are no good solutions to these problems. Since geese enter these areas to feed on the turf, however, one possibility is to use the chemical repellent, methiocarb, to keep geese out of sites where they are unwanted. To explore this possibility, I noted the response of Canada Geese to methiocarb-treated grass. When 0. 5 ha plots on golf courses were treated with methiocarb, free-ranging geese avoided these plots for 1 - 2 weeks. When entire feeding sites were treated, geese avoided these areas for up to 10 weeks. These results indicate that a methiocarb-induced aversive conditioning program may be effective in alleviating some nuisance goose problems. Another potential solution is to try to discourage geese from nuisance sites by planting those sites with some type of grass or cover that geese do not like to eat. I tested this by giving captive geese the opportunity to feed on plots of Kentucky bluegrass, <b>colonial</b> <b>bentgrass,</b> perennial ryegrass, red fescue, and tall fescue. When given a choice, the geese fed significantly more on Kentucky bluegrass and significantly less on tall fescue {{than any of the other}} grasses. Hungry geese however, grazed on any of the grasses if no choice was provided. Hence, discouraging geese from problem sites by planting these areas in a fescue may work, but only if there are good alternative sites available to the geese. Even more effective would be to replace the grass with another type of ground cover, such as Pachysandra or English ivy, which geese find unpalatable...|$|E

The test included a broad representation of turf species for overseeding {{in an effort to}} (1) determine selected specie/cultivar susceptibility and disease expression to rapid blight in the field and (2) survey and assess the association of laboratory isolate detection from field sampling, with disease occurrence and severity of expression of field maintained overseed turf. Over a two year period, Rapid blight, caused by Labyrinthula terrestris was capable of infesting most cool season grasses in this test. In year one, Dawson CRF, SRX 555 slender creeping red fescue, and SR 105210 slender creeping red fescue showed no positive lab detection results from field plots. In year two (2003 - 2004), only SRX 555 SLQ had only 1 plot known to carry Labyrinthula throughout the main infestation season. In year two, essentially all turf plots showed some symptomology of disease expression. This was confirmed by lab identification. Tiller infection rates varied from 2 % to 80 % infection in the lab from field samples. The relationship between tiller infection rates and field plot disease expression was determined by Pearson’s product and Spearman Rank correlation coefficients. Field plot disease scores were correlated with percent tiller infection rates, R² = - 0. 56 plot basis, and R² = – 0. 71 treatment mean basis, respectively.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the irrigation requirements of ten newly established cool-season turfgrass species maintained under two different mowing height and nitrogen fertility regimes. The site was treated with glyphosate to eliminate existing plant material, scalped to remove foliage, leveled, and graded to provide adequate surface drainage. All plots were seeded with a blend of three cultivars for all turfgrass species (Kentucky bluegrass, perennial ryegrass, velvet bentgrass, creeping bentgrass, <b>colonial</b> <b>bentgrass,</b> strong creeping red fescue, chewings fescue, slender creeping red fescue, tall fescue) except for annual bluegrass which was sodded. Plots were mowed at 1. 6 and 5. 1 cm three times and one time per week respectively. Nitrogen was applied at either 0. 45 or 1. 81 kg per 92. 9 m² per year. Water moisture stress was assessed visually as well with a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) moisture probe at a 3. 8 cm depth for the same 45 -day period in 2009 and 2010. Irrigation was applied based on predetermined water replacement values through a hand-held hose with a flow and batch meter attachment. Significant irrigation input differences were observed between mowing height treatments but not among nitrogen fertility treatments. Tall fescue, perennial ryegrass, Kentucky bluegrass, creeping bentgrass and velvet bentgrass were all lower water users under both high and low heights of cut in this trial. The higher water use species, annual bluegrass and red fescues, all required more water in the low mown plots than the high mown plots. A lower crop coefficient for irrigation could be utilized for most species in the Pacific Northwest. Stress detection glasses were able to detect water stress in all turfgrass species tested by a minimum of 1. 2 days on average and a maximum of 2. 4 days in advance of the unaided visual assessment. The glasses were evaluated across a broad range of species and were effective regardless of the different turf canopies and variation in color present in the different species. The early detection of stress would enable turf managers to schedule irrigation in advance while conserving water. For most species the TDR could reliably measure the percent Volumetric Water Content (VWC) at which irrigation was required to maintain a functional turf surface. At the typical recommended mowing height of most species, if maturity was achieved, this was at approximately 30 % VWC. The TDR could be used to more accurately guide irrigation scheduling and reduce water use...|$|E

A number of alternative grass species, not widely used as turf, show significant potential {{for use as}} turf in the United States northern Midwest. Many alternative species have also exhibited better adaptation to low-maintenance conditions than traditionally used species, {{and it is also}} probable that these alternative species may have superior tolerance to common turf pests, specifically diseases. Yet, the use of alternative grass species as a novel integrated pest management strategy has not been explicitly evaluated. In this research, three experiments were conducted to evaluate the use of alternative turfgrass species as an integrated pest management strategy in Minnesota. The objective of the first experiment was to evaluate the field performance of four alternative turfgrass species including hard fescue (Festuca trachyphylla (Hackel) Krajina), <b>colonial</b> <b>bentgrass</b> (Agrostis capillaris L.), tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia caespitosa (L.) P. Beauv.), and prairie junegrass (Koeleria macrantha (Ledeb.) Schult.), under different low-input management regimes in Minnesota. Species were evaluated for turfgrass quality, weed cover, live cover, and disease resistance at two locations in Minnesota over two years. Fertilizer treatment and mowing height significantly affected species performance, and the results indicate that alternative grasses, specifically hard fescue, can be excellent options for lower-input landscapes. Two additional experiments were conducted to determine the economic viability of using alternative grass species as a pest management strategy. First, a choice experiment with real products was conducted to investigate the willingness to pay (WTP) of Minnesota homeowners for maintenance attributes of turfgrasses. Homeowners were willing to pay significant premiums for turfgrasses with reduced irrigation and mowing requirements. Secondly, conjoint analysis was used to further investigate the consumer preferences of Minnesota homeowners for aesthetic and maintenance attributes of turfgrasses, as well as identify potential market segments in the residential turfgrass market. The results suggest that maintenance attributes significantly influence consumer purchasing behavior, and they also identify a strong consumer preference for reduced irrigation and mowing requirements. The analysis also identified four potential consumer segments: the “Price Conscious” segment (consumers who value low cost), the “Shade Adaptation” segment (consumers who value grasses that can grow in the shade), the “Mowing Conscious” segment (consumers who value reduced mowing requirement), and the “Water Conscious” segment (consumers who value grasses with reduced water-use requirements). Overall, the results support that the introduction and use of alternative, low-input turfgrasses would be an economically viable pest management strategy in the residential landscape...|$|E
40|$|When {{choosing}} {{methods and}} technology for maintaining lawns {{it is necessary}} to formulate clearly the aim of the maintenance. Today it is difficult to formulate the aim since the terminology is ambiguous and unclear. This report presents different systems for describing green surfaces. The need for maintenance in the form of mowing grass depends on many different factors, both biological and technical. There {{is a great deal of}} literature on the biological aspects but relatively little concerning technology and methods for maintenance of grass surfaces. There is also a need for interdisciplinary research to study the relationships between different factors. There are many ways of shortening a grass blade. The most common ones are chopping and cutting, used by machines such as rotary lawn mowers and cylinder lawn mowers. In order to chop off grass efficiently, the peripherical speed of the blade must be approximately 35 m/s. When cutting, the friction between blades and grass must be great enough. The cylinder mower is the most suited to very short and plane grass surfaces: it gives a very level cut and spreads the cuttings evenly if these are not collected. For other types of lawn it is better to use a rotary mower since it is less sensitive to damage than a cylinder mower and can also be used on taller grass. The primary disadvantage of the rotary mower is that it spreads the cuttings unevenly. The rotary mower is an interesting alternative to the rotary lawn mower because of its greater capacity, In general, it is possible to reduce the time required as well as the energy consumed by having sharp and correctly adjusted blades and by keeping the lawn mower in good shape. According to the manufacturer, the cylindrical rotary mower divided in sections can be used as an allround mower for different types of grass, but it has not undergone any thorough testing. Earlier research results with <b>Colonial</b> <b>bentgrass</b> show that grass grows faster if it is mown more often. These trials were carried out with very low heights, between 0. 5 and 1. 7 cm. Introductory studies carried out at Alnarp in this project suggest that if the cutting height is raised (from x to y), then this will have the opposite effect, that is that growth diminishes. New grass varieties with a slow growth rate also affect the cutting frequency. When evaluating cutting results, it is difficult to measure the quality of a grassed surface with quantitative methods. This report describes some, but there is a large number of parameters that must be taken into consideration and the methods are not always complete. The report describes a simple ball-rolling method, which however only measures one parameter of grass quality which must be weighed together with other qualities. Subjective methods can also be used, but it is difficult to compare results from different judges. In the future, image analysis can be used as a complement to evaluate the quality of a grass surface. In order to calculate mowing costs, we need data that describe capacity under different conditions. Time studies carried out in the project provide a basis for calculating the total time for mowing. In order to use resources efficiently we need to study mowing as a whole. Future research should focus around how green areas should be designed and the consequences on maintenance costs. This could apply to choice of grass type, meadow for example, and its position within a green area...|$|E

The development of low-input turfgrasses has been challenging for plant breeders. Turfgrasses typically lack resources for crop improvement {{that are common}} in other crops, such as a fully sequenced genome. New tools are needed to study turfgrass and decrease its environmental impact. Two approaches were developed and utilized in this project: investigating the rhizosphere associated with low-input turfgrasses and quantifying silica body deposition in various turfgrass species. Understanding how microorganisms associate with different species and cultivars of turfgrass may in the future provide researchers the ability to breed for turfgrass plants that form better mutualistic and beneficial relationships with soil microorganisms. In some plants, plant genotype {{seems to have a}} significant influence on shaping the microbial community structures. Previous research in Poaceae has shown that a plant genotype has the ability to influence the rhizosphere microbial community structure. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine if turfgrass species affects soil microbial community structure and (2) identify differences in soil microbial community structure of turfgrasses based on nitrogen fertility regime. Rhizosphere and rhizoplane soil samples were taken from six species of turfgrass, prairie junegrass (Koeleria macrantha (Ledeb.) Schult.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), hard fescue (Festuca trachyphylla (Hackel) Krajina), <b>colonial</b> <b>bentgrass</b> (Agrostis capillaris L.), as well as tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia caespitosa (L.) P. Beauv.) and DNA isolated from each sample was then amplicons were pair end sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 at a read length of 2 x 150 base pairs. Data was analyzed using WinSCP, Putty and Mothur. Our results show that the rhizosphere community structure is influenced by location, fertility, and genotype. iii We also found that Thermodesulfobacteria and Thaumarchaeota are associated with fertilized turfgrass soils. Weed incidence, a measure of turf performance, was found to associate to the Actinobacteria, Verrumicrobia, and Bacteroidetes. Results from this research will inform turfgrass researchers about the impacts of turfgrass species and nitrogen fertility on soil microbial communities. The deposition of silicon into epidermic cells of grass species is thought to be an important mechanism that plants use to defend against pests and environmental stresses. Turfgrass cultivars within the same species exhibit different tolerances under traffic stress and some of these differences may be attributed to silica bodies. There are a number of techniques available to study the size, density and distribution pattern of silica bodies in grass leaves. None of those techniques, however, can provide a high-throughput and accurate analysis, especially for a great number of samples. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a high-throughput method that uses the fluorescence-emitting nature of silica bodies along with fluorescence microscopy and image software to investigate the size, density, and distribution patterns of these bodies in the perennial grass Koeleria macrantha. Dry ashing, followed by fluorescent microscopy, was utilized to image silica bodies in prairie junegrass. ImageJ was used to analyze the images for size, number and orientation. We found that dry-ashing and fluorescent microscopy can be combined with ImageJ to create a high throughput method to study silica bodies in turfgrass. Our results indicated that abaxial and adaxial deposition in turfgrasses are significantly different and that turfgrass genotypes showed significant differences in number of carbon inclusions and silica body deposition...|$|E
