30|$|To {{mitigate}} some {{of these}} existing limitations of HLS in virtualizing FPGA usage in the cloud, recent work has provided further innovation [8, 9]. Ma et al. in their work [8], have combined existing development on Domain Specific Languages {{and the use of}} FPGA overlays to offer a runtime interpreter solution to managing FPGA resources. However, because they have taken an overlay approach, as they have cited, they also must offer standard accelerator interface templates for any IO to the FPGA. Such IO interfaces would indeed provide a great amount of flexibility for FPGA accelerator usage, but would suffer on optimality for any specific accelerator’s data access pattern. Chen et al. [9] in their related work on FPGA based cloud computing, go further to recognize that there may be miscellaneous peripherals such as Ethernet controllers and various memory controllers required by specific accelerators. As such they make reference to a context <b>controller</b> <b>switch</b> to handle varying IO sources, but do not elaborate on whether any optimization is being made on this IO interface on a per accelerator application case basis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{explores the}} {{mathematical}} model for electrically discharged machining (EDM) machine. Conventionally, {{it is known}} that the machining efficiency of EDM is closed related to the so-called ignition delay time. Here, it can be observed that the ignition delay time is the RC time-constant of the circuit model of Die-sinking EDM. Then, it can be shown that ignition delay time is closed related to the gap resistance. According to electromagnetic theory, it can be shown that in the first and middle stages of machining process, the overall control system becomes a nonlinear Lur’e system. As for the final stage of machining process, the overall control system becomes a linear system. For the Lur’e problem of Die-sinking EDM, we applied the SPR (Strict Positive Real) condition for the control of EDM. A differential-PID controller is proposed in the beginning and middle stage of machining process. In the final stage of machining process, A PID controller can applied to the final stage of machining process. An adaptive <b>controller</b> <b>switch</b> from Differential-PID (DPID) controller and PID controller is proposed in this paper. Experimental results will be verified. Especially, the machining efficiency can be enhanced up to 33 % compared to the conventional optimal PID controller...|$|E

There are many signal timing strategies for diamond interchanges. Due to the different geometric and traffic conditions, however, none of the available strategies is always optimal. The two most widely used strategies, three-phase, and four-phasewith-two-overlaps, each have limitations during certain traffic conditions. This research focused on the development of a prototype expert system to monitor traffic conditions at a diamond interchange and make adjustments in the phase length, phase sequence, and lane assignments. Utilizing the TexSIM traffic simulator, the expert system, also known as the PASSER III Optimization Manager, or P 30 M, was tested to determine how well it operated under changing traffic conditions. To evaluate the P 30 M, an interchange in Austin, Texas was modeled for two hours. There were three different versions of the P 30 M that were tested to determine if it was more beneficial to change phase lengths, phase order, lane assignment, or all three. The results indicated that the P 30 M can effectively control a diamond interchange by changing the phase order and the lane assignments. It was determined that the P 30 M was not reacting rapidly enough to the changing conditions, and that it occasionally over-reacted in an attempt to catch up. Most of the time, however, the P 30 M operated effectively by reducing delay and queue lengths. Some of the limitations of the p 3 OM may have been contributed to the communications with the controller and attempting to make a standard eight-phase NEMA <b>controller</b> <b>switch</b> from three to four-phase control...|$|E

In optimal control problems, open-loop bang-bang <b>controllers</b> <b>switch</b> discontinuously between extreme values of the inputs to generate minimum-time trajectories from the initial to the final states [1]. Thermostats implement on-off controllers to regulate room temperature [2]. When the temperature is above the desired value, the <b>controller</b> <b>switches</b> the cooling system on. Once the temperature reaches a preset value, the <b>controller</b> <b>switches</b> the cooling system off. The controller is therefore a discontinuous function of the room temperature. In nonsmooth mechanics, the motion of rigid bodies is subject to velocity jumps and force discontinuities as a result of friction and impact [3, 4]. In the robotic manipulation of objects by means of mechanical contact [5], discontinuities occur naturally from interaction with the environment. Discontinuities are also intentionally designed to achieve regulation and stabilization. Sliding mode control [6, 7] uses discontinuous feedback controllers for stabilization. The design procedure for sliding mode control begins by identifying a surface in the state space with the property that the dynamics of the system restricted to this surface are easily stabilizable. Feedback controllers are then synthesized {{on each side of the}} surface to steer the solutions of the system toward the surface...|$|R

40|$|Rotating {{machines}} may, {{for reasons}} of gyroscopic coupling and aerodynamic influences, exhibit speed dependent characteristics. For systems that incorporate active magnetic bearings (AMBs) for rotor levitation, a range of control strategies are available for implementation to achieve desired closed loop dynamic characteristics. Over a large operating speed range, {{it may not be}} possible stabilize a rotor by using only one linear time-invariant (LTI) H controller that has speed independent characteristics. This paper addresses that problem by introducing a <b>switching</b> <b>controller</b> system. The system contains a number of (LTI) H controllers, designed to cover particular speed ranges, together with an external signal to drive the switching action. When speed dependent unbalance forcing acts, each of the controllers is able to attenuate vibration of the rotor over the specific speed ranges. The <b>controller</b> <b>switching</b> points are selected according to a metric that takes account of measured rotor lateral vibration. However, a sudden switching action may induce significant transient disturbance and give rise to rotor vibration overshoot, possibly to the extent of causing rotor-stator contact. To alleviate this problem, a ramp switching signal may be introduced such that two <b>controllers</b> may be <b>switched</b> smoothly over a given time period. Further smoothing modifications are possible to avoid 'over-control' and obtain a better transient performance. The unstable points of each H controller are also discussed with respect to upper threshold speeds, above which <b>controller</b> <b>switching</b> is not allowable...|$|R
40|$|A recent {{problem in}} {{adaptive}} control {{is the task}} of control-ling a plant which is subject to large structural changes. In this case, it is often assumed the plant can be described by a specified family of models, and that the plant can change from {{one member of the}} family of models to some other member of the family of models. Such a system can be controlled by using a set of predefined <b>controllers,</b> and then <b>switching</b> among the <b>controllers</b> to compensate for the change in the plant dynamics. In previous studies, such <b>switching</b> <b>controllers</b> have been found to compensate for changes in the plant dynamics, but the transient response error is typically excessively large, {{due to the fact that}} the <b>switching</b> <b>controller,</b> during its “learning period”, may pro-duce unstable closed-loop systems, which produce exces-sively large control signals. In this paper, a new <b>switching</b> <b>controller</b> is described, which uses model predictive control to impose constraints on the control signals.
