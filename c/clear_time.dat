25|$|Opponents {{say that}} nuclear power poses many threats {{to people and}} the environment, and that costs do not justify benefits. Threats include health risks and {{environmental}} damage from uranium mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation or sabotage, and the unsolved problem of radioactive nuclear waste. Another environmental issue is discharge of hot water into the sea. The hot water modifies the environmental conditions for marine flora and fauna. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong, {{and there have been}} many serious nuclear accidents. Critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology. They argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source. Those countries that do not contain uranium mines cannot achieve energy independence through existing nuclear power technologies.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis introduces an integer linear program called the Minimum Cost Flow with Congestion Assignment (MCF-CA) model. MCF-CA is a multi-period evacuation model {{that uses a}} novel approach called congestion assignment to analyze <b>clearing</b> <b>times</b> during mass evacuations. Congestion assignment discretizes the nonlinear relationship {{between the number of}} vehicles on a road segment and the maximum speed at which those vehicles can travel. MCF-CA selects among three congestion levels (none, moderate, and high) for each road segment in each time epoch. Depending on the congestion level selected, MCF-CA limits the number of vehicles that are able to traverse the road segment and uses Akeliks Time-Dependent Speed-Flow Function (Akelik 2003) to determine the average travel speed of the vehicles for that time period. As a result, we are able to determine approximate evacuation <b>clearing</b> <b>times</b> under nonlinear congestion effects by solving an integer linear program. We limit residents prior knowledge of traffic conditions by implementing MCF-CA in a rolling horizon fashion and study the impact of this limited knowledge on evacuation patterns. We also model the impact of sub-optimal routing decisions on the part of residents by artificially shifting residents toward their own shortest paths rather than a socially optimal route. We find that a mass evacuation can more than double the <b>clearing</b> <b>times</b> of individual county evacuations. However, during both county and mass evacuations, resident routing choices significantly impact <b>clearing</b> <b>times.</b> As more residents choose suboptimal routes, <b>clearing</b> <b>times</b> are prolonged. Lastly, we find that more than 50 % of residents will experience congestion {{at some point during the}} evacuation horizon. However, allowing some congestion improves evacuation <b>clearing</b> <b>times</b> by 2036 % over not congesting. Although congestion decreases vehicle travel speed by 7080 %, over 50 % more residents are able to start or continue evacuating during each time epoch.

40|$|International audienceStability is a {{primordial}} {{concern of}} power systems.

40|$|This master thesis {{has looked}} upon the fault ride through {{capability}} assessment for small-scale hydro {{power plants in}} the distribution grid. In this report, {{the shape of the}} voltage dip has been studied, and the voltage angle impact on critical <b>clearing</b> <b>time</b> has been analyzed. A model of the Snåsa grid has been used to study faults with the simulation program SIMPOW. The SINTEF DipLab has been simulated, and the results from simulations have been compared to measurements made during experiments at Bruvollelva power plant. An in-house lab has been built to study the significance of the surrounding grid, as a weaker grid connection theoretically increases the voltage angle fluctuations, and hence decreases the critical <b>clearing</b> <b>time</b> of the generator. When studying the voltage dips caused by three phase symmetrical faults in the distribution grid, the location of the fault has proven to be important. One of the reasons is the difference in voltage angle. The voltage dips with origin in a fault in a parallel radial to the point of measurement gives a small fluctuation in voltage angle, while faults between the point of measurement and the swing bus creates larger changes in voltage angle. The reason is that the whole load flow changes when the swing bus is disconnected, and the DG units have to cover all the demand. The critical <b>clearing</b> <b>time</b> for the distributed generating unit Bruvollelva was simulated in this report for two different cases. A symmetrical fault was implemented, and the same voltage profile was then implemented without the same voltage angle response. The increase in critical <b>clearing</b> <b>time</b> was about 20 % for the voltage dips with origin between the DG unit and the swing bus, while the increase was much lower for the faults with origin in a parallel radial. A correlation can be seen, as the faults leading to the highest fluctuations in voltage angle was the same faults that gave the largest increases in <b>clearing</b> <b>time.</b> This indicates that the voltage angle has a considerable impact on the critical <b>clearing</b> <b>times</b> of the machine, and hence a considerable impact on the fault ride through capability assessment. The implementation guidelines for network codes amplifies the importance of the short-circuit capacity at the connection point in the pre-fault and post-fault condition. The robustness of the network has significant impact of the FRT performance, and a minimum requirement for short circuit capacity should be defined in the national FRT restrictions. An in-house lab was built to verify the results from the simulations. The outcome was surprising, as a weak grid connection lead to a <b>clearing</b> <b>time</b> of 600 ms when the generator was operating at 7 Nm, while the stronger grid connection made the generator trip at 500 ms. The experiments should however have been made with a longer cable, and should be repeated to increase the credibility of the results. Another verification of the simulation model was made when the measurements from the experiments made at Bruvollelva was compared to simulations. The results showed that the voltage dips were similar. Protection relays should also have been implemented to the simulations model, as they were a limiting factor {{when it came to the}} <b>clearing</b> <b>time</b> of the fault. Generally, the measured dips caused by the DipLab were more square shaped than the simulated dips. It has been showed that the voltage due to a three phase fault is less square shaped at the generator nodes than in the rest of the system due to a higher inductance in the short circuit impedance. This is especially the case for periods with high production...|$|R
