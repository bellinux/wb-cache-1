The turboramjet is a hybrid engine that essentially {{consists of a}} turbojet mounted inside a ramjet. The turbojet core is mounted inside a duct that contains a combustion chamber downstream of the turbojet nozzle. The turboramjet can be run in turbojet mode at takeoff and during low-speed flight but then switch to ramjet mode to accelerate to high Mach numbers.|$|E
50|$|An {{air-breathing}} engine - or rocket-based, <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>engine</b> - {{gets its}} initial take-off power from specially designed rockets, called air-augmented rockets, that boost performance about 15 percent over conventional rockets. When the vehicle’s velocity reaches twice {{the speed of}} sound, the rockets are turned off and the engine relies totally on oxygen in the atmosphere to burn the fuel. Once the vehicle’s speed increases to about 10 times the speed of sound, the engine converts to a conventional rocket-powered system to propel the vehicle into orbit. Testing of the engine continues at General Applied Sciences Laboratory facilities on Long Island, N.Y.|$|E

40|$|For {{the summer}} of 2010, I have {{been working in the}} Aerodynamics and Propulsion Branch at NASA Dryden Flight Research Center {{studying}} combined-cycle engines, a high speed propulsion concept. <b>Combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>engines</b> integrate multiple propulsion systems into a single engine capable of running in multiple modes. These different modes allow the engine to be extremely versatile and efficient in varied flight conditions. The two most common types of <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>engines</b> are Rocket-Based <b>Combined</b> <b>Cycle</b> (RBCC) and Turbine Based <b>Combined</b> <b>Cycle</b> (TBCC). The RBCC essentially combines a rocket and ramjet engine, while the TBCC integrates a turbojet and ramjet 1. These two engines are able to switch between different propulsion modes to achieve maximum performance. Extensive conceptual and ground test studies of RBCC engines have been undertaken; however, an RBCC engine has never, to my knowledge, been demonstrated in flight. RBCC engines are of particular interest because they could potentially power a reusable launch vehicle (RLV) into space. The TBCC has been flight tested and shown to be effective at reaching supersonic speeds, most notably in the SR- 71 Blackbird 2...|$|R
40|$|Aviation has {{to reduce}} its emission. In the past the {{improvements}} of aero engine technology have been achieved by higher turbine inlet temperatures, higher overall pressure ratios, higher bypass ratios and more efficient components. However, these methods hold only limited potential for further improvements. Therefore, research into alternative cycle concepts started. No best solution for future aircraft engines has been identified yet and thus this research continues. As part of this research, the <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>engine</b> has been proposed as a new solution. It has been realised that the thermal energy of the exhaust gases is the biggest energy loss in a turbofan engine. The <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>engine</b> uses {{a combination of a}} conventional turbofan engine and an additional supercritical Brayton cycle to use this exhaust gas heat to produce additional thrust power. A heat exchanger uses the exhaust gases of the main engine as the heat source for the supercritical cycle. Initial investigations showed many difficulties in the application of this cycle and limited potential for fuel burn reduction. This study aims at investigating the behaviour of different <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>engine</b> designs to find an optimal design {{and to be able to}} estimate the potential of the concept based on this optimal design. To predict the behaviour of the <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>engine,</b> a simulation framework has been created and the results have been compared to similar investigations in literature. In addition to this, a gradient based optimization routine has been implemented to be able to optimize the system for the maximum range. With this methodology, the effect of the supercritical cycle operating conditions, the configuration of the main engine, the supercritical working fluid, the supercritical cycle configuration and the heat exchanger design have been investigated. It was found that the behaviour of the system is very non linear. The optimum performance becomes a trade off between the specific fuel consumption and the weight. The operating parameters of the supercritical cycle and the heat exchanger design have the biggest impact on the system performance. The heat exchanger technology plays an important role in enabling good heat exchanger designs in that it limits the minimum size and wall thickness of the heat exchanger tubes. The addition of an inter turbine burner to the main engine was found to be beneficial to the performance of the supercritical cycle and the <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>engine</b> as a whole. While a turboshaft configuration of the main engine brings thermodynamic benefits for the <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>engine,</b> it causes a higher weight of the heater. Therefore, a turbofan engine is the superior main engine for the <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>engine.</b> The combination of a turbofan engine with an inter turbine burner and a simple recuperated supercritical carbon dioxide cycle has been identified as the best configuration of the <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>engine.</b> In this configuration, the cooler is placed downstream of the fan of the main engine. The application of this cycle on a Boeing 777 ER could increase the range of the aircraft by 0. 46 %. With more advanced production techniques for the heat exchangers, a range increase of 2. 15 % becomes possible. However, more in depth research has to be performed, to confirm these results. <br/...|$|E

In a liquid rocket engine several complex processes take place that are not thoroughly understood. Droplet evaporation, turbulence, finite rate chemistry, instability, and injection/atomization phenomena are some of the critical issues being encountered in a liquid rocket engine environment. Pulse Detonation Engines (PDE) performance, combustion chamber instability analysis, 60 K motor flowfield pattern from hydrocarbon fuel combustion, and 3 D flowfield analysis for the <b>Combined</b> <b>Cycle</b> <b>engine</b> were of special interest to NASA. During the summer of 1997, we made an attempt to generate computational results for all of the above problems and shed some light on understanding some of the complex physical phenomena. For this purpose, the Liquid Thrust Chamber Performance (LTCP) code, mainly designed for liquid rocket engine applications, was utilized.
