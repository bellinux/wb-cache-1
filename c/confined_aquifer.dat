40|$|The {{distribution}} of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), one class of persistent organic pollutants, in groundwater, especially in <b>confined</b> <b>aquifers</b> remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated {{the occurrence of}} 12 PFAAs through a water cycle from the Huai River Basin to the Yellow Sea, including <b>confined</b> <b>aquifers,</b> unconfined aquifers, rivers, and coastal waters. We found the ubiquity of PFAAs in all types of samples, including those from <b>confined</b> <b>aquifers</b> (2. 7 – 6. 8  ng/L). Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were the major PFAAs in all samples, accounting {{for an average of}} 49. 1 % (0. 8 – 84. 8 %) and 33. 3 % (6. 3 – 92. 2 %) of total PFAAs, respectively. Comparing the concentration of PFOA with that of PFOS, we found a higher concentration of PFOA in rivers and a higher concentration of PFOS in <b>confined</b> <b>aquifers.</b> Short-chain perfluoropentanoic acid accounted for an average of 10. 3 % (1. 9 – 24. 6 %) of total PFAAs in rivers and coastal waters. Branched isomers of both PFOA and PFOS were detected in most samples (36 / 42 and 39 / 42, respectively). One-way analysis of variance indicated {{a significant difference in the}} profiles of PFAAs among the different types of water samples. Principal component analysis suggested that rainwater and recent uses of PFAAs could be the major sources of PFAAs in <b>confined</b> <b>aquifers,</b> while recent and current uses of PFAAs could be the major source of PFAAs in unconfined aquifers, rivers and coastal waters. The risk quotients of PFOA and PFOS in groundwater and rivers were 2 – 3 orders of magnitude lower than unity, indicating no immediate risks via drinking water consumption.

25|$|An aquifer is an {{underground}} layer of water-bearing permeable rock, rock fractures or unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, or silt) from which groundwater can be extracted using a water well. The study of water flow in aquifers and {{the characterization of}} aquifers is called hydrogeology. Related terms include aquitard, which is a bed of low permeability along an aquifer, and aquiclude (or aquifuge), which is a solid, impermeable area underlying or overlying an aquifer.

40|$|The hydrogeochemical {{evolution}} and arsenic mobilization mechanisms in groundwater occurring in <b>confined</b> <b>aquifers</b> formed within glaciomarine sediments in the Lower Fraser Valley, British Columbia, are addressed. Methodology includes analysis {{of chemical and}} isotopic composition of groundwater, and mineralogical and chemical analysis of sediment samples sourced from core. Groundwater in <b>confined</b> <b>aquifers</b> is Na-HCO 3 or Na-Cl type, basic and reduced; whereas groundwater in unconfined aquifers is Ca-Mg-HCO 3 type, near neutral and oxidized. The chemistry of groundwater in <b>confined</b> <b>aquifers</b> is controlled by cation exchange, dissolution of carbonate minerals, silicate mineral weathering, and mixing with saline connate water suggesting freshening conditions. Arsenic release occurs as groundwater flows through glaciomarine sediments; its mobility is favoured by basic pH and reducing groundwater conditions.

40|$|This {{report has}} 1 plate {{listed as a}} {{separate}} file. Ground water comprises {{nearly all of the}} water supply in Kent County, Delaware. The <b>confined</b> <b>aquifers</b> of the area {{are an important part of}} this resource base. The aim of this study is to provide an up-to-date geologic framework for the <b>confined</b> <b>aquifers</b> of Kent County, with a focus on their stratigraphy and correlation. Seven <b>confined</b> <b>aquifers</b> are used for water supply in Kent County. All occur at progressively greater depths south-southeastward, paralleling the overall dip of the sedimentary section that underlies the state. The two geologically oldest, the Mount Laurel and Rancocas aquifers, are normally reached by drilling only in the northern part of the county. The Mount Laurel aquifer is an Upper Cretaceous marine shelf deposit composed of clean quartz sands that are commonly glauconitic. It occurs at around 300 ft below sea level in the Smyrna Clayton area and is typically just less than 100 ft thick. Southward, toward Dover, it passes into fine-grained facies that do not yield significant ground water. The Rancocas aquifer is a Paleocene to Eocene marine unit of shelf deposits consisting of glauconite-rich sands with shells and hard layers. It occurs as high as 100 ft below sea level in northwestern Kent County and deepens southeastward, rapidly changing facies to finer-grained, nonaquifer lithologies in the same direction...|$|R
