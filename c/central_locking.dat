40|$|Abstract- This paper {{focuses on}} the design and {{development}} of a security system for an automobile using GSM technology and electronic circuit which {{is being used to}} prevent or control the theft of a vehicle. The case of car hijacking has become so rampant that it has become a threat to the world leaders. Some of them cannot drive their expensive cars without escort plus the sounding of siren to scare the evil perpetrators. The necessity of car security cannot be overemphasized by car owners due to high cost of purchasing car nowadays. Car security system using GSM and Electronic circuit had been designed, which can operate in two ways: receiving signal / command from the car owner through the mobile phone or by taken decision by itself using electronic circuit. The signal received through the mobile phone that serves as input to the circuit and immediately sends signal through transistor TR 1 and TR 2 to the 555 timer IC 1 to other transistors in the circuit and output of one transistor serves as input signal to another. The output signal from the PIC 16 F 84 A or CD 4017 demobilized the <b>central</b> <b>lock</b> system and brain box of the car. The demobilized <b>central</b> <b>lock</b> system and brain box can be reset by calling or sending another signal through the mobile phone to reset the brain box...|$|R

25|$|From launch, {{the car was}} {{available}} in base (Popular), L, GL, Ghia and XR3 trim. From mid-1982, a five-speed manual gearbox was introduced across the range. This was now standard on the 1.6L versions and could be specified as an option on most 1.3L engines. A selection of features were available, either as standard fitment or optional extras depending on model, including a tilt-and-slide sunroof, <b>central</b> <b>locking,</b> and electric windows. All models except for base and L were fitted with a check-light system for low fuel, low oil, low coolant, low screenwash, and worn out brake pads. Power steering was not available on European Escorts although it {{was available}} on the US Escort. For the 1983 model year, the Ford ATX three-speed automatic transmission (developed primarily for the US version) was available on the 1.6L engine {{within a couple of}} years of the car's launch.|$|E
