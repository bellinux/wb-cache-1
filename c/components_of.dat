In this paper, we show that the higher persistence <b>of</b> the cash <b>component</b> <b>of</b> earnings is attributable to net cash distributions to equityholders. This result holds despite the fact that net cash distributions to equityholders account for less than one third of the total variation in the cash <b>component</b> <b>of</b> earnings. We also show that investors correctly anticipate the lower persistence of the remaining cash <b>component</b> <b>of</b> earnings, contradicting Sloan’s hypotheses that investors naively fixate on earnings. *We are grateful for the comments of Todd Doersch and workshop participants at Georgetown University and UCLA.

5|$|As well {{as being}} added, forces can also be {{resolved}} into independent components {{at right angles to}} each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into <b>components</b> <b>of</b> a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the <b>components</b> <b>of</b> the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the <b>components</b> <b>of</b> the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is {{in the same direction as}} one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.|$|E
