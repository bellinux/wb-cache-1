25|$|TIGAR {{can promote}} {{development}} or inhibition of several cancers {{depending on the}} cellular context. TIGAR <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> effect on three characteristics of cancer; the ability to evade apoptosis, uncontrolled cell division, and altered metabolism. Many cancer cells have altered metabolism where the rate of glycolysis and anaerobic respiration are very high whilst oxidative respiration is low, which is called the Warburg Effect (or aerobic glycolysis). This allows cancer cells to survive under low oxygen conditions, and use molecules from respiratory pathways to synthesise amino acids and nucleic acids to maintain rapid growth.|$|E

In 1998 and 2008, he supported relaxation of the then strict laws against pornography, arguing that pornography <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> social benefits, and he has criticised {{what he calls the}} body-shame phobia against nudism, suggesting that nudity may be natural and healthy for society.|$|E
25|$|Rank {{and status}} are fixed from birth. There {{is no way}} in Tongan society to climb up in rank. A low ranking chief will always remain the lesser of a high ranking chief, even though his lands may be bigger and richer and so forth. But he can try to marry a high ranking woman, for {{instance}} if she is interested in his rich lands, and so increase the rank of his children. Status on the other hand, although usually fixed too, <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> vertical movement. The second son of a noble, normally not in line for his father's title, may get it after all if his older brother dies prematurely. In addition to this sometimes, but very rarely, the king may elevate some person to high status.|$|E

25|$|The series explores social problems, {{including}} discrimination, scientific advancement, political greed, brotherhood, family, and war. Scar's backstory and his {{hatred of}} the state military references the Ainu people, who had their land taken by other people. This includes the consequences of guerrilla warfare {{and the amount of}} violent soldiers a military <b>can</b> <b>have.</b> <b>Some</b> of the people who took the Ainus' land were originally Ainu; this irony is referenced in Scar's use of alchemy to kill alchemists even though it was forbidden in his own religion. The Elrics being orphans and adopted by Pinako Rockbell reflects Arakawa's beliefs about the ways society should treat orphans. The characters' dedication to their occupations reference the need to work for food. The series also explores the concept of equivalent exchange; to obtain something new, one must pay with something of equal value. This is applied by alchemists when creating new materials and is also a philosophical belief the Elric brothers follow.|$|E
25|$|The Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine sub-appellation is {{the most}} {{productive}} and notable region of Muscadet, producing {{more than three-quarters of}} the region's entire production. (In contrast, the Muscadet-Coteaux de la Loire AOC only produces around 20% of the amount of wine of Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine) In fact, more AOC Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine is produced on a yearly basis than in any other single AOC in the entire Loire Valley. The appellation is located east and south around the city of Nantes and is named after the rivers Sèvre and Maine that flow through it. Vineyard soil composition varies throughout the region and can range from the granite and schist hillsides around the village of Saint-Fiacre-sur-Maine to the predominantly clay based soils of Vallet. The most ideally situated vineyards are located around the villages of La Chapelle-Heulin, St-Fiacre, Vallet and Vertou Around 45% of the wine made Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine is aged sur lie. The wines made in this style tend to be slightly fuller body and <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> of the texture and mouthfeel of a white Bourgogne AOC. Well made examples will have a balance of fruit, acidity and texture.|$|E
500|$|Infinite {{networks}} are largely of only theoretical interest {{and are the}} plaything of mathematicians. [...] Infinite networks that are not constrained by real-world restrictions <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> very unphysical properties. [...] For instance Kirchhoff's laws can fail in some cases and infinite resistor ladders can be defined which have a driving-point impedance which depends on the termination at infinity. [...] Another unphysical property of theoretical infinite networks is that, in general, they will dissipate infinite power unless constraints are placed on them {{in addition to the}} usual network laws such as Ohm's and Kirchhoff's laws. [...] There are, however, some real-world applications. [...] The transmission line example is one of a class of practical problems that can be modelled by infinitesimal elements (the distributed element model). [...] Other examples are launching waves into a continuous medium, fringing field problems, and measurement of resistance between points of a substrate or down a borehole.|$|E

500|$|Like {{transmission}} line filters, waveguide filters always have multiple passbands, {{replicas of the}} lumped element prototype. [...] In most designs, only the lowest frequency passband is useful (or lowest two {{in the case of}} band-stop filters) and the rest are considered unwanted spurious artefacts. [...] This is an intrinsic property of the technology and cannot be designed out, although design <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> control over the frequency position of the spurious bands. [...] Consequently, in any given filter design, there is an upper frequency beyond which the filter will fail to carry out its function. [...] For this reason, true low-pass and high-pass filters cannot exist in waveguide. [...] At some high frequency there will be a spurious passband or stopband interrupting the intended function of the filter. [...] But, similar to the situation with waveguide cutoff frequency, the filter can be designed so that the edge of the first spurious band is well above any frequency of interest.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Meg {{threatens to}} commit suicide because {{she does not have}} a date for her Junior Prom. Even her backup boy turned her down by {{shooting}} his little brother and having to attend his funeral. As a last resort, Brian agrees {{to take her to the}} prom.

After the dance, Meg begins to think Brian is her boyfriend, despite Brian saying he has no feelings for her and citing his already existing relationship with Jillian. Meg develops an obsession with Brian, even baking him a pie and using her hair as one of the ingredients. Stewie arrives and sits next to Brian and asks if he <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> pie.

500|$|The breed {{has four}} {{recognized}} colours. Cavaliers which have rich chestnut markings on a pearly white background {{are known as}} Blenheim in honour of Blenheim Palace, where John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, raised the predecessors to the Cavalier breed in this particular colour. In some dogs there is a chestnut spot {{in the middle of}} the forehead: this is called the [...] "Blenheim" [...] spot. The Blenheim spot is also known as the mark of the [...] "Duchess Thumb Print", based on the legend that Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough while awaiting news of her husband's safe return from the Battle of Blenheim, pressed the head of an expecting dam with her thumb, resulting in five puppies bearing the lucky mark after news that the battle had been won. Black and Tan are dogs with black bodies with tan highlights, particularly eyebrows, cheeks, legs and beneath the tail. Black and Tan is referred to as [...] "King Charles" [...] in the King Charles Spaniel. Ruby Cavaliers should be entirely chestnut all over, although some <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> white in their coats which is considered a fault under American Kennel Club conformation show rules.
