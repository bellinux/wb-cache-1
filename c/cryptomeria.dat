5|$|Marasmius funalis {{is known}} only from Kawasaki, Kanagawa and Machida, Tokyo, Japan. Mushrooms grow in groups on dead plant matter, {{and have been}} {{recorded}} on Japanese cedar (<b>Cryptomeria</b> japonica) wood and leaf litter in woodland mostly made up of Chonowski's hornbeam (Carpinus tschonoskii) and bamboo-leaf oak (Quercus myrsinifolia).

5|$|The host {{spectrum}} of the Amylostereaceae comprises several, partially very different genera of Coniferae. A.chailletii usually infests Pinaceae such as firs (Abies) and spruces (Picea), but also cedars (Cedrus) and Douglas firs (Pseudotsuga). A.areolatum has a similar host spectrum, which uses mainly firs, Japanese cedars (<b>Cryptomeria),</b> larches (Larix), spruces, pines (Pinus) and Douglas firs as hosts. While spruces dominate as hosts in the native habitat, this species {{is more common in}} pines on other locations. The host {{spectrum of}} A.laevigatum comprises Cupressaceae such as junipers (Juniperus) or cypresses (Cupressus) and the English yew (Taxus baccata). A.ferreum is, however, only common on neotropic yellowwoods (Podocarpus).|$|E
5|$|Chorioactis geaster has a disjunct distribution, and {{has only}} been {{collected}} from Texas and Japan. The first reported collection in Japan was in Kyushu in 1937, {{and then it was}} not collected again in that location until thirty-six years later. In 2006, it was observed in a humid forest near Kawakami, Nara Prefecture. The fungus's natural habitat in Japan is disappearing because of the practice of deforestation and replanting with Japanese cedar (<b>Cryptomeria</b> japonica). This rare mushroom has been put on the list of threatened species in Japan. In Texas, the fungus has been reported in Collin, Hays, Travis, Dallas, Denton, Guadalupe, Tarrant and Hunt counties. Travis, Hays, and Guadalupe counties are in central Texas, while the remainder are clustered together in the northeastern part of the state. Although the species is considered rare due to its globally restricted distribution, it may be locally abundant.|$|E
60|$|The temple {{steps were}} of black lacquer, and the frames of the sliding screens red. That money, lakhs and lakhs of money, had been lavished on the wonder {{impressed}} me but little.

Passing under a mighty stone arch we came into a square of splendour alive with the sound of hammers. Thirty or forty men were tapping the pillars and steps of a carnelian shrine heavy with gold.

Colonel Olcott is {{wandering}} {{up and down}} the country now, telling them that the Buddhist religion needs reformation, offering to reform it, and eating with ostentation rice gruel which is served to him in cups by admiring handmaidens. A wanderer from Kioto tells me that in the Chion-in, loveliest of all the temples, he saw only three days ago the Colonel mixed up with a procession of Buddhist priests, just such a procession as the one I tried vainly to describe, and [...] "tramping about as if the whole show belonged to him." [...] You cannot appreciate the solemnity of this until you have seen the Colonel and the Chion-in temple. The two are built on entirely different lines, and they don't seem to harmonise. It only needs now Madame Blavatsky, cigarette in mouth, under the <b>cryptomerias</b> of Nikko, and the return of Mr. Caine, M. P., to preach the sin of drinking saki, and the menagerie would be full.|$|R
25|$|With 36% of its {{area covered}} by forest, Tokyo has {{extensive}} growths of <b>cryptomeria</b> and Japanese cypress, {{especially in the}} mountainous western communities of Akiruno, Ōme, Okutama, Hachiōji, Hinode, and Hinohara. Decreases {{in the price of}} timber, increases in the cost of production, and advancing old age among the forestry population have resulted in a decline in Tokyo's output. In addition, pollen, especially from <b>cryptomeria,</b> is a major allergen for the nearby population centers. Tokyo Bay was once a major source of fish. Currently, most of Tokyo's fish production comes from the outer islands, such as Izu Ōshima and Hachijōjima. Skipjack tuna, nori, and aji are among the ocean products.|$|E

6000|$|Round each temple stood a {{small army}} of priceless bronze or stone lanterns, stamped, as was {{everything}} else, with the three leaves that make the Daimio's crest. The lanterns were dark green or lichened grey, and in no way lightened the gloom of the red. Down below, by the sacred bridge, I believed red was a joyous colour. Up the hillside under the trees and the shadow of the temple eaves I saw that it was the hue of sorrow. When the great king killed the beggar at the ford he did not laugh, as I have said. He was very sorry, and said: [...] "Art is Art, and worth any sacrifice. Take that corpse away and pray for the naked soul." [...] Once, in one of the temple courtyards, nature dared to rebel against the scheme of the hillside. Some forest tree, all unimpressed by the <b>cryptomerias,</b> had tossed a torrent of tenderest pink flowers down the face of a grey retaining wall that guarded a cutting. It was as if a child had laughed aloud at some magnificence it could not understand.|$|R
40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{mechanism}} of desiccation damage of forest trees wintering on frozen soil and in wind-swept areas, some experiments were made using Ezo spruces and <b>cryptomerias.</b> The results obtained are as follows: 1. The Ezo spruces growing in wind-swept areas were seriously damaged, while those {{in the lee of}} wind break were normal. 2. In seriously damaged spruces, the leaves, small twigs and upper stems died, but these basal stems and roots were usually remain undamaged. 3. In damaged spruces, the water content of leaves and small twigs was considerably smaller than that of normal ones, while that of stems and roots was almost the same as in normal ones. 4. During winter, the leaves and twigs of the spruce could withstand even freezing at- 30 °C. These results obtained lead {{to the conclusion that the}} young spruces wintering in frozen soil and wind-swept areas are damaged by desiccation due to an unbalance of water in leaves, small twigs and upper stems which comes from the freezing of soil or stems for a long time. It was also determined that the freezing points of xylem in the basal stem and root were- 0. 52 and- 0. 25 °C respectively. Actually, it was confirmed that when a limited part of the basal stem was kept frozen at temperatures below- 0. 55 °C, the water ascent in the stem was completely blocked. I...|$|R

500|$|Cushing House {{was built}} {{on the north side of}} campus and sits apart from most of the school's other dorms, with the {{exception}} of Noyes House to its west. Cushing stands four stories tall and is configured in a U shape with two wings of student rooms connected by center common areas on the ground floor and more halls of student housing on the upper [...] "trans" [...] (inter-wing) levels. Between the wings is a courtyard covered by a lawn and trees. Two articles published in Vassar's weekly Miscellany News in 1975 identified some of the species present at the time: <b>Cryptomeria</b> japonica, Ilex opaca (American holly), several crab apple trees, and a Fagus sylvatica (European beech). The exterior of the house is built in an Old English manor house style designed to mimic the nearby Pratt House which was designed by architects York and Sawyer and completed in 1916. The roof of the hall is made of slate, with walls of patterned brickwork covered with half-timbered decorations as well as leaded windows and towers.

5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} 2nd {{foundation}} of Buenos Aires by Captain Juan de Garay in 1580 (the {{first one was}} in 1536 by Pedro de Mendoza [...] ), among the first 400 land lots apportioned {{was that of a}} 180-hectare (450 acre) parcel 20 kilometers (13 mi) north of the city. The land, situated on a bluff overlooking the Río de la Plata, was awarded to Rodrigo de Ibarola, a lieutenant of Garay's. A prime section of the property was purchased in 1774 by Manuel de Basavilbaso, the Postmaster General of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. His daughter, Justa Rufina, married Miguel de Azcuénaga, a military officer who would later take part in the May Revolution of 1810 (prologue to the Argentine War of Independence). He also established one of the area's first apiaries on the grounds.Azcuénaga inherited the land on the death of his wife in 1829, and their son, Miguel José, in turn inherited it in 1833. He converted the property into an equestrian estate, though the rise of Buenos Aires Province Governor and strongman Juan Manuel de Rosas led to his exile in Chile for a number of years. Azcuénaga ultimately returned and, in 1851, commissioned a graduate of the École Polytechnique, Prilidiano Pueyrredón, to design a manor house. Pueyrredón created an eclectic design centered on Neogothic and Baroque architecture, and upon its completion in 1854, Azcuénaga came to refer to the mansion as his [...] "birdcage"; Pueyrredón was also a renowned painter, and created a portrait of his friend and client shortly after the mansion's completion. Azcuénaga landscaped the sprawling property with a selection of palm trees, among them Butia, Phoenix canariensis, and Chamaerops humilis. He also had vast extensions planted with Araucaria bidwillii, cedars, <b>cryptomerias,</b> cypresses, tipas and pines planted, as well as a row of plantains (which graced his favorite path). Azcuénaga, who had no legitimate offspring, bequeathed the property to his nephew, Antonio Justo Olaguer Feliú. The blind Olaguer, who had no use for the view of the waterfront, sold the easternmost portion of the land before his death in 1903 and bequeathed it to his nephew, Carlos Villate Olaguer. Villate stipulated on his receiving the property that, upon his death, it should be deeded to the Argentine Government for the purpose of its use as the Official Summer Residence of the President of Argentina.|$|R
6000|$|Five {{hours in}} the train {{took us to the}} {{beginning}} of a 'rickshaw journey of twenty-five miles. The guide unearthed an aged cart on Japanese lines, and seduced us into it by promises of speed and comfort beyond anything that a 'rickshaw could offer. Never go to Nikko in a cart. The town of departure is full of pack-ponies who are not used to it, and every third animal tries to get a kick at his friends in the shafts. This renders progress sufficiently exciting till the bumpsomeness of the road quenches all emotions save one. Nikko is reached through one avenue of cryptomerias--cypress-like trees eighty feet high, with red or dull silver trunks and hearse-plume foliage of darkest green. When I say one avenue, I mean one continuous avenue twenty-five miles long, the trees so close to each other throughout that their roots interlace and form a wall of wood {{on either side of the}} sunken road. Where it was necessary to make a village along the line of march,--that is to say once every two or three miles,--a few of the giants had been wrenched out--as teeth are wrenched from a full-planted jaw--to make room for the houses. Then the trees closed up as before to mount guard over the road. The banks between which we drove were alight with azaleas, camelias, and violets. [...] "Glorious! Stupendous! Magnificent!" [...] sang the Professor and I in chorus for the first five miles, in the intervals of the bumps. The avenue took not the least notice of our praise except by growing the trees even more closely together. [...] "Vistas of pillared shade" [...] are very pleasant to read about, but on a cold day the ungrateful heart of man could cheerfully dispense with a mile or two of it if that would shorten the journey. We were blind to the beauty around; to the files of pack-ponies with manes like hearth-brooms and the tempers of Eblis kicking about the path; to the pilgrims with blue and white handkerchiefs on their heads, enviable silver-grey leggings on their feet, and Buddha-like babies on their backs; to the trim country drays pulled by miniature cart-horses bringing down copper from the mines and saki from the hills; to the colour and movement in the villages where all the little children shouted [...] "Ohio's!" [...] and all the old people laughed. The grey tree-trunks marched us solemnly along over that horrid bad road which had been mended with brushwood, and after five hours we got Nikko in the shape of a long village at the foot of a hill, and capricious Nature, to reward us for our sore bones, laughed on the instant in floods of sunshine. And upon what a mad scene did the light fall! The <b>cryptomerias</b> rose in front of us a wall of green darkness, a tearing torrent ran deep-green over blue boulders, and between stream and trees was thrown a blood-red bridge--the sacred bridge of red lacquer that no foot save the Mikado's may press.|$|R

60|$|On the morrow {{morning we}} took the road in kuruma, the road proper, as Yejiro called it; for it was the main bond between Noto {{and the rest of}} Japan. This was the nearest {{approach}} it had to a proper name, a circumstance which showed it not to be of the first importance. For in Japan, all the old arteries of travel had distinctive names, the Nakasendo or Mid-Mountain road, the Tokaido or Eastern Sea road, and so forth. Like certain other country relations, their importance was due to their city connections, not to their own local magnitude. For, when well {{out of sight of the}} town, they do not hesitate to shrink to anything but imposing proportions. In mid career you might often doubt yourself to be on so celebrated a thoroughfare. But they are always delightful to the eye, as they wander through the country, now bosomed in trees among the mountains, now stalking between their own long files of pine, or <b>cryptomeria,</b> across the well-tilled plains. This one had but few sentinels to line it in the open, but lost little in picturesqueness for its lack of pomp. It was pretty enough to be very good company itself.|$|E

50|$|Hay fever was {{relatively}} uncommon in Japan {{until the early}} 1960s. Shortly after World War II, reforestation policies resulted in large forests of <b>cryptomeria</b> and Japanese cypress trees, which were an important resource for the construction industry. As these trees matured, they started to produce large amounts of pollen. Peak production of pollen occurs in trees of 30 years and older. As the Japanese economy developed in the 1970s and 1980s, cheaper imported building materials decreased the demand for <b>cryptomeria</b> and Japanese cypress materials. This resulted in increasing forest density and aging trees, further contributing to pollen production and thus, hay fever. In 1970, about 50% of <b>cryptomeria</b> were more than 10 years old, and just 25% were more than 20 years old. By 2000, almost 85% of <b>cryptomeria</b> were over 20 years old, and more than 60% of trees were over 30 years old. This <b>cryptomeria</b> aging trend has continued since then, and though <b>cryptomeria</b> forest acreage has hardly increased since 1980, pollen production has continued to increase. Furthermore, urbanization of land in Japan led to increasing coverage of soft soil and grass land by concrete and asphalt. Pollen settling on such hard surfaces can easily be swept up again by winds to recirculate and contribute to hay fever. As a result, approximately 25 million people (about 20% of the population) currently suffer from this type of seasonal hay fever in Japan.|$|E
