5|$|The {{discovery}} of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932, followed by that of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch soon after, opened up {{the possibility of a}} controlled nuclear chain reaction using uranium. At the time, few scientists in the United States thought that an atomic bomb was practical, but the possibility that a German atomic bomb project would develop atomic weapons sufficiently <b>concerned</b> <b>scientists</b> who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, that they drafted the Einstein–Szilard letter to warn President Franklin D. Roosevelt. This prompted preliminary research in the United States, beginning in late 1939.|$|E
5|$|Throughout this, Idelba {{has been}} {{secretly}} working on atomic physics {{and she and}} her fellow researchers have made some disturbing discoveries. They conclude that {{it would be possible to}} make a devastating weapon from nuclear chain reactions and fear that the military will try to create such bombs and restart the war. In order to prevent this, Idelba tries desperately to hide all evidence about her research and contacts <b>concerned</b> <b>scientists</b> in other parts of the world. The government learns of her work however and raids the Zawiyya to get hold of her papers, but Budur manages to hide them. Idelba eventually dies of radiation poisoning from the materials she was working with and leaves all her research to Budur, who keeps her secret and eventually manages to organize an international conference of scientists to discuss the nuclear issue. The meeting is held in Isfahan in Iran (one of the few Islamic nations which has prospered since the war) and scientists from all over the world attend. They agree that none of them will work on the creation of nuclear weapons for their respective countries, no matter what pressure they are put under by their governments and also start a new international scientific movement to break down barriers between cultures in a spirit of reconciliation and friendship (they even create a new scientific calendar to be used by the whole world, with its year zero set from the time of the conference).|$|E

The impact of their introduction on interactions with other species is difficult to predict. For instance, the Chamek spider monkey also eats Clarisia racemosa, which could lead to competition with the Alagoas curassow.

50|$|Perhaps the {{principal}} <b>concern</b> <b>scientists</b> have expressed over assisted colonization {{is the potential}} for relocated species to be invasive in their new habitats, driving out native species. The fear that assisted colonization will facilitate invasions stems mostly from observations of the vast numbers of species that have become invasive outside their native ranges by (often inadvertent) introduction by humans. Although most agree that assisted colonization efforts, unlike accidental introductions, should involve detailed planning and risk assessment, for some, any threat of introducing invasive species, no matter how small, disqualifies assisted colonization as a viable management response to climate change.|$|R

25|$|ExxonMobil funded {{organizations}} {{opposed to}} the Kyoto Protocol and seeking to influence public opinion about the scientific consensus {{that global warming is}} caused by the burning of fossil fuels. ExxonMobil helped to found and lead the Global Climate Coalition, which opposed greenhouse gas emission regulation. In 2007 the Union of <b>Concerned</b> <b>Scientists</b> said that ExxonMobil granted $16million, between 1998 and 2005, towards 43 advocacy organizations which dispute the impact of global warming, and that ExxonMobil used disinformation tactics similar to those used by the tobacco industry in its denials of the link between lung cancer and smoking, saying that the company used many of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue.|$|E
25|$|The {{sponsorship}} of AGU by ExxonMobil became {{a source of}} concern for many members after evidence surfaced that ExxonMobil had known about climate change for decades but had actively worked to undermine climate science. On February 22, 2016, a letter signed by 100 scientists was delivered to the AGU, requesting that they cut all ties with ExxonMobil and other companies that foster climate misinformation. The AGU Board of Directors met on 22 April 2016 and voted to continue accepting sponsorship from ExxonMobil, arguing {{that there was not}} unequivocal evidence that ExxonMobil continues to participate in climate misinformation. Instead of making a short-term political statement, the Board wished to engage with the energy industry over the long term. In response, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Representative Ted Lieu sent a critical letter saying that ExxonMobil continues to fund climate denial and is misleading the AGU. The Union of <b>Concerned</b> <b>Scientists</b> also sent a letter urging them to reconsider. However, in a meeting on 23 September 2016, the Board upheld its previous decision.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Achieving a {{controlled}} and reproducible means to direct stem cell differentiation {{is the single}} most critical <b>concern</b> <b>scientists</b> have been trying to address since the discovery of stem cells. In this regard, the use of small molecules and RNA interference offers unique advantages by targeting different cellular mechanisms.

DexAM is a single vehicle that not only solubilizes hydrophobic small molecules in physiological solutions but also forms complexes with siRNA molecules, making it an attractive delivery system for controlling stem cell differentiation. Herein, we report the synthesis and application of DexAM to simultaneously deliver hydrophobic small molecules an...|$|R

500|$|In February 2004, the Union of <b>Concerned</b> <b>Scientists</b> {{published}} a report accusing the Bush administration of manipulating science for political purposes, listing more than 20 alleged incidents of censoring scientific results or applying {{a litmus test}} in the appointment of supposedly scientific advisory panel members. In April 2004, Marburger {{published a}} statement rebutting the report and exposing errors and incomplete explanations in it, and stating that [...] "even when the science is clear—and often it is not—it is but one input into the policy process," [...] but [...] "in this Administration, science strongly informs policy." [...] The Union of <b>Concerned</b> <b>Scientists</b> issued a revised version of their report after Marburger's statement was published. Marburger also called the report's conclusions illusory {{and the result of}} focusing on unrelated incidents within a vast government apparatus, and attributed the controversy as being related to the upcoming elections. It was noted that Marburger enjoyed close personal relationships with President Bush, White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and Office of Management and Budget Director Joshua Bolten, attesting to his active involvement within the administration.|$|E
