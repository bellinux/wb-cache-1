50|$|The station {{opened in}} 1963; its total {{electrical}} capacity was 720 MW comprising six 120 MW generating units. A 120 MW Unit comprised a coal-fired (later oil-fired) boiler supplying high-pressure steam to a GEC three-cylinder reheat steam turbine, {{which in turn}} powered a hydrogen-cooled 120 MW alternator. Each unit had its own control room interposed between the boiler and turbine manned by a unit operator and an assistant unit operator. They in turn were assisted by two auxiliary plant attendants, one for the boiler, the other for the turbine plant. The electrical output of each unit, and therefore the station, was co-ordinated by a single load dispatch office who were in contact with grid control at East Grinstead. The electrical output of the station was routed by cables and overhead conductors to two grid sub stations, Northfleet East and Northfleet West, where the station fed the national grid. At full load each boiler consumed 50 tonnes of coal per hour, which was delivered by ship, first to a coal yard then to bunkers that fed <b>cylindrical</b> <b>ball</b> mills to create pulverised fuel, which was then blown into the boiler furnace. The steam conditions were 510 °C at 1500 psi. The design of this station can be considered the founding development of ever larger boiler / turbine units. As a coal-burning station, it was converted to burn oil in the early 1970s. The station closed in 1991.In 2000 the Government gave permission to Scottish and Southern Energy plc to build a 110 MW gas-fired {{combined heat and power}} station to supply the heat and electricity needs of the Kimberly-Clark paper mill at Northfleet.|$|E

40|$|Monitoring the {{operating}} conditions of rolling bearings and prediction {{of the remaining}} lifetime of bearings {{is one of the}} most crucial tasks in machine diagnosis. This work presents the results of the auralization of structure-borne sound in bearings and the transmission in machines. These signals correspond to the vibration measured on the machine’s housing generated by <b>cylindrical</b> and <b>ball</b> bearings under similar running conditions and different operation times. Measured transfer functions and a suitable physical model of the rough contact of surfaces, adapted to the case of bearings, furnish the basis for the simulation. This is compared with measurements in an experimental machine. The methodology used here shows to be sensitive to small variations of the state of the surfaces of bearings in early stages of operation and states an alternative for machine diagnosis. ...|$|R
30|$|While a {{novel marker}} {{tracking}} approach (allowing faster, more precise tracking of multiple, even fast moving markers) {{has been published}} previously (Jiang et al. 2013), the steps from marker tracking towards an identification of anatomical marker locations have not been described. Although the steps towards a full identification of all markers were time consuming and could only performed manually (e.g. separation from <b>cylindrical</b> from <b>ball</b> markers), they allowed a safe determination of the marker locations. Future improvements could include automated separation between <b>ball</b> and <b>cylindrical</b> markers as well as computational algorithms that allow an automated identification of ventricular, annular and leaflet markers. The use of markers with different shapes could further simplify automated marker identification. It should, however, be considered that any shape other than spherical becomes less optimal {{from the perspective of}} marker tracking (the 2 -dimensional shape of a ball is independent of the angle of the X-ray camera).|$|R
40|$|Variety of helical {{end mill}} {{geometry}} {{is used in}} industry. Helical <b>cylindrical,</b> helical <b>ball,</b> taper helical ball, bull nosed and special purpose end mills are widely used in aerospace, automotive and die machining industry. While the geometry of each cutter may be different, the mechanics and dynamics of the milling process at each cutting edge point are common. This paper presents a generalized mathematical model of most helical end mills used in industry. The end mill geometry is modeled by helical flutes wrapped around a parametric envelope. The coordinates of a cutting edge point along the parametric helical flute are mathematically expressed. The chip thickness at each cutting point is evaluated by using the true kinematics of milling including the structural vibrations of both cutter and workpiece. By integrating the process along each cutting edge, which is {{in contact with the}} workpiece, the cutting forces, vibrations...|$|R

5000|$|A {{pillow block}} usually {{refers to a}} housing with an {{included}} anti-friction bearing. A pillow block refers to any mounted bearing wherein the mounted shaft is in a parallel plane to the mounting surface, and perpendicular to the center line of the mounting holes, as contrasted with various types of flange blocks or flange units. A pillow block may contain a bearing with one of several types of rolling elements, including <b>ball,</b> <b>cylindrical</b> roller, spherical roller, tapered roller, or metallic or synthetic bushing. The type of rolling element defines the type of pillow block. These differ from [...] "plumber blocks" [...] which are bearing housings supplied without any bearings and are usually meant for higher load ratings and a separately installed bearing.|$|R
40|$|The article {{compares the}} {{modeling}} results of dynamic {{processes in the}} three-dimensional mechanical systems, obtained through the application " simulation of kinematic mechanisms" of NX system and domestic PA 8 and PA 9 systems. Comparison is done for mathematical and physical pendulum whose behavior is described by an analytic solution that allows an objective evaluation the resulting numerical solution. The periods of pendulum swing, obtained in NX and PA 9 systems coincide to the third decimal place. The paper implements a modeling gyroscopic effect, calculation of precession and nutation periods, as well as comparison with the analytical values of the approximate theory of gyroscopes; for NX and PA 8 a divergence is maximum 6. 5 %. Simulation of two-link mechanism in NX and PA 9 systems has shown almost complete consistency of the results. For a system mechanism consisting of bodies, <b>cylindrical</b> and <b>ball</b> joints, a divergence of the results is of 10 %, due to different models of elements and because of differently specified impact. The research results allow us to draw a conclusion on the competitiveness of PA 8 and PA 9 systems (and even on their advantages). So in case of available Russian graphic editors and their programming interface, creating the high-quality domestic CAD can be suggested...|$|R
40|$|Coaxial valves usually contain {{only one}} moving part. It {{has not been}} easy, then, to provide for {{electric}} motor actuation. Many actuators being proposed involve designs which lead to bulky packages. The key facing those improving coaxial valves is the provision of suitable linear actuation. The valve herein indudes a valve housing with a flow channel there-through. Arranged in the flow channel is a closing body. In alignment with the closing body is a ball screw actuator which includes a ball nut and a <b>cylindrical</b> screw. The <b>ball</b> nut sounds a threaded portion of the cylindrical screw. The cylindrical screw is provided with a passageway there-through through which fluid flows.

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the {{construction}} and properties of bearings and pivots for use in instruments. The static and running friction for both thrust and radial loads was determined {{for a number of}} conical pivots and <b>cylindrical</b> and <b>ball</b> bearings. The static rocking friction was also measured for several conical and ball bearings under a heavy load, especially to determine their suitability for use in N. P. L. (National Physical Laboratory) type wind tunnel balance. In constructing conical pivots and sockets {{it was found that the}} pivots should be hardened and highly polished, preferably with a revolving lap, and that the sockets should be made by punching with a hardened and polished punch. It was found that for a light load the conical pivots give less friction than any other type, and their wearing qualities when hardened are excellent. Very small ball bearings are unsatisfactory because the proportional accuracy of the balls and races is not high enough to insure smooth running. For rocking pivots under heavy loads it was found that a ball-and-socket bearing, consisting of a hemispherical socket and a sphere of smaller diameter concentric with it, with a row of small balls resting between the two, was superior to a pivot resting in a socket. It was found that vibration such as occurs in an airplane will greatly reduce the static friction of a pivot or bearing, in some cases to as little as one-twentieth of its static value...|$|R
40|$|Most mobile {{platforms}} or vehicles used {{in today}} are non holonomic. They {{only have one}} or two independent degrees of freedom. Because of that its manuarability is limited and often require much space to control like turning and parking. By improving degrees of freedom (improving the manuarability) of a vehicle it can follow many complex trajectories that are difficult or impossible by conventional non holonomic vehicles. Any mobile platform that has three independent degrees of freedom in a plane is a Holonomic platform. Independent degrees of freedom means it can change it orientation or position with out effecting other not like car type vehicles that require turning or changing its orientation when need to move. Holonomic motion is very useful because its abilities such as, avoid any obstacle while keeping its orientation same, capability to move in constrained spaces and track a target while moving in an arbitrary trajectories etc. Because of these advantages and capabilities some of the scientific and industrial researches are targeting to develop holonomic mobile platforms. Already robotics community have managed to build some working models and used in applications like robot soccer games and mobile robot manipulations. And many different mechanisms have been created to achieve the holonomic capability. These include various arrangements of Swedish wheels or omni wheels, chains of spherical or <b>cylindrical</b> wheels, <b>ball</b> wheels and powered caster wheels etc. While most of these designs are practical in indoor environments they are not suitable for outdoor operations in large scale versions In this research project our goal was to develop a viable design to achieve holonomic capability that minimizes these problems and more suited for the outdoor operations. The proposed design has a wheel arrangement much like a car but with the capability of independent driving and steering capability of each of the four wheels. Car type rolling and steering mechanism avoid any uneven wear of the wheels and avoid lateral forces applied on the wheels. Wheel driving and steering mechanism was designed such a way that wheels and be steered 360 degrees continuously with out interfering with the wheel drive system. This enables robot to move in complex trajectories continuously without stopping for w~heel resetting. And the developed platform has increased ground [...] :. clearance that is necessary for outdoor rough terrain operations like farming. Apart from all these benefits design comes with the requirement of complex control system to control itself. Four independent wheels with eight degrees of freedoms to achieve three degree of freedom motion is a redundant control problem and require complex. control system. Using inverse kinematics model of the platform and multiprocessor design with advance microcontrollers we have tried to solve these issues "and were able to achieve successful performance.
