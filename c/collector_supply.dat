40|$|After an {{introduction}} to amplifiers in communications and an exposition of the literature specifically relevant to high linearity power amplifiers, this study investigates more thoroughly various aspects of envelope feedback as applied to Bipolar Tuned Power Amplifiers at HF and VHP. It is discovered that under the correct conditions a new mode of linear operation exists where gain compression, AM-PM conversion and input impedance are simultaneously linearised, and in this region DC-RF power efficiency is also improved. Spectral measurements are presented from an envelope feedback amplifier constructed to operate over this region. A computerised system is described for measuring accurately the gain and phase shift of the test amplifier against variation of <b>collector</b> <b>supply,</b> quiescent bias current and RF drive power. The results from these measurements are presented as 3 -dimensional projections and as contour plots. Subsequently the stored data is used to re-construct two-tone spectra, which is then analysed to show contributions to the spectrum from the gain compression and AM-PM conversion mechanisms separately. Conclusions are drawn with respect to effects of bias on these two mechanisms. A mechanism has been discovered which gives a symetric spectra without requiring AM-PM conversion at the fundamental frequencies. An attempt is made to model the amplifier with a non-linear circuit transient analysis program (SPICE). Good correlation is obtained for some parameters and these results are also plotted in 3 -D and in contour...|$|E

Fossil pectoral spines belonging to this taxon were first recognized in 1822, from chalk deposits in England, by Gideon Mantell, the physician and geologist who also discovered the dinosaur Iguanodon. In 1857, the fish was named Protosphyraena ferox by the renowned American naturalist and paleontologist, Joseph Leidy, based on Mantell's English finds. Earlier, Leidy had published an illustration of a Protosphyraena tooth from the Cretaceous-aged Navesink Formation of New Jersey (Maastrichtian), but mistakenly identified is as having come from a dinosaur. During the 1870s, B. F. Mudge, a fossil <b>collector</b> <b>supplying</b> material to rival paleontologists Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh, discovered a number of specimens of Protosphyraena in Niobrara exposures in Rooks and Ellis counties in Kansas and sent them back east. Between 1873 and 1877, Cope renamed three species based on Mudge's specimens, all of which would eventually be recognized as belonging to the genus Protosphyraena: Erisichte nitida, [...] "Portheus" [...] gladius, and [...] "Pelecopterus" [...] pernicciosus. Between 1895 and 1903, paleontologists in America and England, including Arthur Smith Woodward (1895), Loomis (1900), O. P. Hay (1903), in a series of important works, reviewed the genus, adding much to our understanding of this fish.|$|R
