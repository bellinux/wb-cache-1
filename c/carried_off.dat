5|$|In the First Test of {{the series}} at Nottingham, Davidson removed Cowdrey before his ankle slipped in a {{footmark}} during the first innings and a bone was chipped. He was <b>carried</b> <b>off</b> with figures of 1/22 and his ankle plastered. The injury was such that {{he was unable to}} bat even with the assistance of a runner and was absent. This injury sidelined him until August.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{structural}} material was long ago <b>carried</b> <b>off</b> for reuse in buildings in Cley and Blakeney. The surviving ruins are protected as a scheduled monument and Grade II listed building because of their historical importance, {{but there is no}} active management. The ever-present threat from the encroaching sea is likely to accelerate following a realignment of the Glaven's course through the marshes, and lead to the loss of the ruins.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{becoming}} Emperor, Domitian's {{role in the}} Flavian government was largely ceremonial. In June 71, Titus returned triumphant {{from the war in}} Judaea. Ultimately, the rebellion had claimed the lives of over 1 million people, a majority of whom were Jewish. The city and temple of Jerusalem were completely destroyed, its most valuable treasures <b>carried</b> <b>off</b> by the Roman army, and nearly 100,000 people were captured and enslaved.|$|E

5|$|After {{his return}} to Geneva, Knox was chosen to be the {{minister}} at a new place of worship petitioned from Calvin. In the meantime, Elizabeth Bowes wrote to Knox, asking {{him to return to}} Margery in Scotland, which he did at the end of August. Despite initial doubts {{about the state of the}} Reformation in Scotland, Knox found the country significantly changed since he was <b>carried</b> <b>off</b> in the galley in 1547. When he toured various parts of Scotland preaching the reformed doctrines and liturgy, he was welcomed by many of the nobility including two future regents of Scotland, the Earl of Moray and the Earl of Mar.|$|E
5|$|Always {{in need of}} funds, Raynald urged Manuel to {{send the}} promised subsidy to him, but Manuel failed to pay the money. Raynald made an {{alliance}} with Thoros II of Cilicia. They attacked Cyprus, subjecting the Byzantine island to a three-week orgy of violence in early 1156. They only left Cyprus on the rumour of an imperial fleet approaching the island, but only after they had forced all Cypriots to ransom themselves, {{with the exception of}} the wealthiest individuals (including Emperor Manuel's nephew, John Doukas Komnenos), whom they <b>carried</b> <b>off</b> to Antioch. Cyprus would never entirely recover from the devastation that Raynald's and Thoros's marauding raid caused.|$|E
5|$|As Barksdale's men pushed toward Sickles's {{headquarters}} {{near the}} Trostle barn, the general {{and his staff}} began {{to move to the}} rear, when a cannonball caught Sickles in the right leg. He was <b>carried</b> <b>off</b> in a stretcher, sitting up and puffing on his cigar, attempting to encourage his men. That evening his leg was amputated, and he returned to Washington, D.C. Gen. Birney assumed command of the III Corps, which was soon rendered ineffective as a fighting force.|$|E

5|$|Beer's first {{keyboard}} instructor was Franz Lauska, a pupil of Johann Georg Albrechtsberger and a favoured {{teacher at}} the Berlin court. Beer also became one of Muzio Clementi's pupils while Clementi was in Berlin. The boy made his public debut in 1801 playing Mozart's D minor Piano Concerto in Berlin. The Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung reported: 'The amazing keyboard playing of young Bär (a Jewish lad of 9), who <b>carried</b> <b>off</b> the difficult passages and other solo parts with aplomb, and has fine powers of rendition even more rarely found {{in one of his}} age, made the concert even more interesting'.|$|E
5|$|Freshmen were {{expected}} to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth. For almost two decades, the students constructed Bonfire from debris and wood acquired through various, sometimes illicit, means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912. In 1935, a farmer reported that students <b>carried</b> <b>off</b> his entire barn as fuel for Bonfire. To prevent future incidents, the university made Bonfire a school-sanctioned event. The following year, for the first time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for the students and pointed them toward a grove of dead trees {{on the edge of}} town.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after that}} campaign, Simeon sought {{to punish the}} Serbian ruler Petar Gojniković who had {{attempted}} to betray him by concluding an alliance with the Byzantines. Simeon sent an army led by two of his commanders, Theodore Sigrica and Marmais, to Serbia. The two managed to persuade Petar to attend a personal meeting, during which he was enchained and <b>carried</b> <b>off</b> to Bulgaria, where he died in a dungeon. Simeon put Pavle Branović, prior to that an exile in Bulgaria, on the Serbian throne, thus restoring the Bulgarian influence in Serbia for a while.|$|E
50|$|An {{emissary}} (Latin emissarium, from ex and mittere, to send out) is a channel, {{natural or}} artificial, by which an outlet is formed to <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> any stagnant body of water.

5|$|In March 1973, The Concert for Bangladeshs {{significance}} was further underlined when it won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. In Harrison's absence, Ringo Starr attended the awards ceremony in Nashville and <b>carried</b> <b>off</b> {{a tray of}} Grammys, {{one for each of}} the featured performers. Author Peter Lavezzoli writes that, with the success of the live album and Saul Swimmer's concert documentary, which opened in US cinemas in March 1972, Indian classical music reached its largest Western audience to date through the Concert for Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} English {{translation}} of 1847 by Mary Howitt, the tale {{opens with a}} beggar woman giving a peasant's wife a barleycorn in exchange for food. Once planted, a tiny girl, Thumbelina (Tommelise), emerges from its flower. One night, Thumbelina, asleep in her walnut-shell cradle, is <b>carried</b> <b>off</b> by a toad who wants her as a bride for her son. With the help of friendly fish and a butterfly, Thumbelina escapes the toad and her son, and drifts on a lily pad until captured by a stag beetle who later discards her when his friends reject her company.|$|E
5|$|Michigan's {{offense was}} forced to punt 11 times, {{compiled}} only 189 yards of total offense (147 passing yards and 42 rushing yards) and was held to 45 yards in the entire second half. Two of Michigan's touchdowns came on defense (Weathers' interception return) and special teams (Woodson's punt return). Griese, who was <b>carried</b> <b>off</b> the field by his teammates {{at the conclusion of}} the game, was Michigan's offensive leader, completing 14 of 25 passes for 147 yards and no interceptions. Thomas posted 29 rushing yards on 14 carries and was Michigan's leading receiver with 8 catches for 77 yards. Woodson also played a key role with his 78-yard punt return, third-quarter interception and 37-yard pass reception.|$|E

5|$|On November 2, 2010, in a {{game against}} the Ottawa Senators, Phaneuf {{sustained}} an injury in the leg by having it cut open with a skate from Peter Regin while crashing into the boards. He was <b>carried</b> <b>off</b> the ice immediately and had surgery done the same night. Phaneuf was said to be off the ice for four-to-six weeks, and made a return to the Leafs' line-up on December 9, 2010, a home ice game against the Philadelphia Flyers, which Philadelphia won 4–1, though he had one assist on the lone Toronto goal.|$|E
5|$|The 2005–06 {{season was}} a disappointing {{one for the}} Rockets, as McGrady {{appeared}} in only 47 games due to injury. At various points during the year, he missed time due to back spasms, including a moment in January where {{he had to be}} <b>carried</b> <b>off</b> the court in a stretcher due to a severe flare up. Despite his health concerns, McGrady was able to play in that year's All-Star Game in front of his home crowd in Houston, exploding for 36 points in just 27 minutes. For the season, he averaged 24.4 points and 6.5 rebounds per game. Due in part to his frequent absences, the Rockets failed to qualify for the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The match started badly with an {{incident}} in the first minute of play, a tackle by Leeds striker Allan Clarke bringing down Phil Thompson who needed treatment. Clarke was then a marked man and was twice fouled badly himself, first by Tommy Smith and then by Alec Lindsay. Clarke was <b>carried</b> <b>off</b> after the second challenge and replaced by Duncan McKenzie. Smith was booked for his challenge on Clarke and Johnny Giles also received a booking after throwing a punch at Keegan.|$|E
