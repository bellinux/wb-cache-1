25|$|The year of 1971 {{was vital}} to VAM as it {{represented}} a <b>complete</b> <b>turn</b> {{around for the}} company. The new Camioneta Rambler American based on the Hornet Sportabout was introduced, the Rambler Classic obtained all characteristics of AMC's new Matador, and the Javelin was restyled as a new generation. On the outside, the car was {{exactly the same as}} its AMC counterpart with the only exception of the wheels and the lack of factory stripes and decals. A unique characteristic of the second generation VAM Javelin was round porthole opera windows mounted on the C-pillars installed by some VAM dealerships either with or without vinyl roofs.|$|E
25|$|Bowen {{was first}} {{selected}} for the Wales international team for the opening match of the 1896 Home Nations Championship, against England. Bowen was brought in at threequarters opposite Newport's Bert Dauncey on the wing with Owen Badger and Welsh captain Arthur 'Monkey' Gould at centre. Bowen and Dauncey would both retain their positions throughout the tournament, being the first wing pair to do so since Biggs and McCutcheon in Wales' Triple Crown winning Championship in 1893. The 1896 England encounter at Blackheath was a sporting disaster for the Wales team, losing by seven tries to nil, and the Welsh selectors reacted with sweeping changes to the pack. The next game saw a <b>complete</b> <b>turn</b> around in Welsh fortunes, with a 6–0 win over Scotland. Bowen retained his place, but the match is notable for the introduction of Welsh rugby legend Gwyn Nicholls at centre with Gould. Gould was a changed player in the Scotland encounter, marshalling the game throughout and supporting the inexperienced Welsh pack. Of the two tries scored by Wales in the match both came from the threequarters; one from Gould and the other from Bowen, his first and only international points. The {{final game of the}} 1896 series, was an away game to Ireland. The inexperienced pack suffered badly from the Irish kick-and-rush tactic, and new halfback Llewellyn Lloyd was constantly exposed to heavy Irish attacks. Despite a dropped goal from Gould, Wales lost 4–8.|$|E

2500|$|The {{double helix}} is the {{dominant}} tertiary structure for biological DNA, and is also a possible structure for RNA. [...] Three DNA conformations {{are believed to be}} found in nature, A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA. The [...] "B" [...] form described by James D. Watson and Francis Crick is believed to predominate in cells. James D. Watson and Francis Crick described this structure as a double helix with a radius of 10 Å and pitch of 34 Å, making one <b>complete</b> <b>turn</b> about its axis every 10 bp of sequence. The double helix makes one <b>complete</b> <b>turn</b> about its axis every 10.4-10.5 base pairs in solution. This frequency of twist (known as the helical pitch) depends largely on stacking forces that each base exerts on its neighbours in the chain. [...] Double-helical RNA adopts a conformation similar to the A-form structure.|$|E

The differences of the measured rotational speed {{with respect to the}} averaged one based on <b>complete</b> <b>turns</b> of the rotor are produced by the harmonic terms of the rotational speed. Cup anemometer sampling periods include a certain number of <b>complete</b> <b>turns</b> of the rotor, plus one incomplete turn, the residuals from the harmonic terms integration within that incomplete turn (as part of the averaging process) being responsible for the mentioned deviations.

2500|$|Due to his {{commitments}} {{to the national}} team in the summer, Tevez {{was not on the}} bench for City in the first Premier League match of the 2011–12 season against Swansea City. Tevez made his first appearance of the season in City's second match of the season against Bolton Wanderers, coming on in the 68th minute for fellow Argentine Sergio Agüero. Despite losing the captain's armband to Vincent Kompany, Tevez stated in an interview he had a <b>complete</b> <b>turn</b> around on his stance on Manchester and that he is not moving: [...] "I'm happy at City and I'm not moving from there." [...] Tevez started his first match of the season against Wigan Athletic, in which Tevez missed a penalty that was won by David Silva; nonetheless, he played well in the match which ended 3–0 to City, with Agüero scoring a hat-trick. On 14 September, Tevez made an appearance in City's first ever UEFA Champions League match, against Napoli, coming on as a second-half substitute for Edin Džeko in a 1–1 draw.|$|E
2500|$|In {{geometry}} and physics, spinors are {{elements of a}} (complex) vector space that {{can be associated with}} Euclidean space. Like geometric vectors and more general tensors, spinors transform linearly when the Euclidean space is subjected to a [...] slight (infinitesimal) rotation. [...] When a sequence of such small rotations is composed (integrated) to form an overall final rotation, however, the resulting spinor transformation depends on which sequence of small rotations was used: unlike [...] vectors and tensors, [...] a spinor transforms to its negative when the space is rotated through a <b>complete</b> <b>turn</b> from 0° to 360° (see picture). This property characterizes spinors. [...] It is also possible to associate a substantially similar notion of spinor to Minkowski space in which case the Lorentz transformations of special relativity play the role of rotations. Spinors were introduced in geometry by Élie Cartan [...] in 1913. of dimensions, each spinor having [...] components where [...] or [...]" [...] The star (*) refers to Cartan 1913.

60|$|The {{depth of}} the inner tube of the whistle at any moment is shown by the {{graduations}} {{on the outside of}} the instrument. The lower portion of the instrument as formerly made for me by the late Mr. Tisley, optician, Brompton Road,[28] is a cap that surrounds the body of the whistle, and is itself fixed to the screw that forms the plug. One <b>complete</b> <b>turn</b> of the cap increases or diminishes the {{depth of the}} whistle, by an amount equal to the interval between two adjacent threads of the screw. For mechanical convenience, a screw is used whose pitch is 25 to the inch; therefore one turn of the cap moves the plug one twenty-fifth of an inch, or ten two-hundred-and-fiftieths. The edge of the cap is divided into ten parts, each of which corresponds to the tenth of a complete turn; and, therefore, to one two-hundred-and-fiftieth of an inch. Hence in reading off the graduations the tens are shown on the body of the whistle, and the units are shown on the edge of the cap.|$|E
