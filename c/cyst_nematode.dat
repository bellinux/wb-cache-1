Furthermore, we documented the presence of other conserved sequences that resemble the variable domains described in Heterodera and Globodera CLE effectors. These findings document that root-knot nematodes appear to use CLE ligand mimicry and point toward a common host node targeted by two evolutionarily diverse groups of nematodes.

40|$|<b>Cyst</b> and root-knot <b>nematodes</b> show {{high levels}} of gross {{morphological}} similarity. This presents difficulties {{for the study of}} their ecology in natural ecosystems. In this study, <b>cyst</b> and root-knot <b>nematode</b> species, as well as some ectoparasitic nematode species, were identified using the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS 2) sequence variation detected by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP). The ITS 2 region was sufficiently variable within the taxa investigated to allow species to be separated on the basis of minor sequence variation. The PCR primers used in this study were effective for 12 species with three genera within the Heteroderinae (Globodera pallida, G. rostochiensis, Heterodera arenaria/avenae, H. ciceri, H. daverti, H. hordecalis, PI. mani, PI. schachtii, H. trifolii, Meloidogyne ardenensis, M. duytsi and M. maritima).

Results: We present the complete genome sequence of G. pallida, together with transcriptomic data from most of the nematode life cycle, particularly focusing on the life cycle stages involved in root invasion and establishment of the biotrophic feeding site. Despite the relatively close phylogenetic relationship with root-knot nematodes, we describe a very different gene family content between the two groups and in particular extensive differences in the repertoire of effectors, including an enormous expansion of the SPRY domain protein family in G. pallida, which includes the SPRYSEC family of effectors.

40|$|Plant-parasitic <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> {{are major}} {{agricultural}} pests worldwide. These obligate endoparasites invade {{the roots of}} host plants where they transform cells near the vascular cylinder into a permanent feeding site. Plants possess a multilayered innate immune system consisting {{of different types of}} extracellular and intracellular immune receptors. These enable detection of most invading nematodes and initiate immune responses that result in resistance. Many plant pathogens use effectors to overcome resistance. Here, modulation of plant innate immunity by plant-parasitic <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> was investigated. Extracellular immune receptor signaling and hormone-mediated signaling pathways were found to contain infection of susceptible Arabidopsis thalianawith Heterodera schachtii. A large family of effectors was identified in Globodera rostochiensis. One of these so-called SPRYSECs interacted with a novel CC-NB-LRR type resistance protein of a susceptible tomato without inducing resistance responses. Instead, the effector was found to suppress defense-related programmed cell death and resistance mediated by several CC-NB-LRR type resistance proteins. In addition, a secreted antimicrobial peptide was identified in G. rostochiensis. Plant-parasitic <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> thus most likely secrete effectors that protect against plant immune responses and secondary infections.

40|$|Potato <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> (PCN) are {{quarantine}} organisms, {{and they}} belong to the economically most relevant pathogens of potato worldwide. Methodologies to assess the viability of their cysts which can contain 200 - 500 eggs protected by the hardened cuticle of a dead female, are either time and labor intensive, or lack robustness. We present a robust and cost-efficient viability assay based on loss of membrane integrity upon death. This assay uses trehalose, a disaccharide present at a high concentration in the perivitelline fluid of PCN eggs, as a viability marker. Although this assay can detect a single viable egg, the limit of detection for regular field samples was higher, ~ ten viable eggs, due to background signals produced by other soil components. On the basis of thirty non-viable PCN samples from The Netherlands, a threshold level was defined (¿Atrehalose= 0. 0094) below which the presence of more than ten viable eggs is highly unlikely (true for ~ 99. 7 % of the observations).
