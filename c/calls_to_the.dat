5|$|On September 30, 2015, the Seattle Police Department {{cleared the}} {{building}} of squatters, an estimated 50 to 200 people, after unsuccessful attempts by Onni to secure the property.

5|$|Following the bombing, French Gabonese {{made more}} {{threatening}} phone <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> embassy. A second bomb exploded {{at the embassy}} two nights later, causing no damage. A drive-by shooting, during which at least five rounds of buckshot were fired from a 12-gauge automatic shotgun, riddled the second story windows with over 30 holes. It is likely that its perpetrators were French, as Gabonese {{have no access to}} grenades. Following the second bombing a car containing white men was noticed, driving through otherwise empty Shore Boulevard. At the time, practically the only white men in Gabon were French.|$|E

5|$|Selfridges {{was bombed}} again on 17 April 1941, {{suffering}} further damage, including {{the destruction of}} the Palm Court Restaurant. The basement was converted to a communications base, with a dedicated line run along Oxford Street to Whitehall, and allowed British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to make secure and direct telephone <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The store was damaged again on 6 December 1944 after a V2 rocket exploded on nearby Duke Street, causing its Christmas tree displays to collapse into the street outside. Damage was quickly repaired and the shop re-opened the following day.|$|E
5|$|From April to September 1982, the Queen {{was anxious}} but {{proud of her}} son, Prince Andrew, who was serving with British forces during the Falklands War. On 9 July, the Queen awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder, Michael Fagan, {{in the room with}} her. In a serious lapse of security, {{assistance}} only arrived after two <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Palace police switchboard. After hosting US President Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visiting his California ranch in 1983, the Queen was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of Grenada, one of her Caribbean realms, without informing her.|$|E
5|$|In the subplot, Marge {{finds an}} anomalously high phone bill for calls made by Lisa to the Corey hotline — a premium rate phone service where {{television}} fans {{can listen to}} the voice of a fictional actor based on The Two Coreys.

After Principal Skinner catches her, Marge suggests that Lisa try to go until midnight without calling the hotline; if she can do so, she will have conquered her addiction. Although tempted {{throughout the rest of the}} day, Lisa beats her addiction.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Call</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Post -- During each pregame show, a solo trumpeter plays <b>Call</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Post into a {{microphone}} {{to be heard}} throughout the stadium. This is a reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city of Louisville's long history with horse racing as <b>the</b> <b>Call</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Post tune is customarily played by a bugler just minutes before a horse race. There is usually a second playing of this, occurring just {{before the start of}} the second half of the football game by the same trumpeter that played it during pregame. This year, for the first time in CMB history the trumpet player that plays <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> post is a freshman.|$|R

5|$|Maloin <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> butcher's {{and drags}} Henriette {{from the store}} against her will and over the protestations of the butcher's wife (Kati Lázár). He brings her to the tavern for a drink, where he overhears the barkeep telling another patron the story of Brown's meeting with the inspector, {{revealing}} that Morrison had called the local police when Brown absconded. Though Henriette refuses her drink, Maloin buys her an expensive mink stole. They return home {{to the consternation of}} Camélia, who cannot comprehend why Maloin has ruined Henriette's chances of a job and spent what little savings the family had on the extravagant stole. During Maloin's shift the next night he is visited by Morrison, who questions him as to the previous night's events as the body of the drowned man is retrieved from the quayside below.|$|E
5|$|The Inn {{continued}} to prosper {{during the reign}} of James I (1603–1625) and the beginning of that of Charles I, when over 100 students per year were recorded as joining. The outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642 {{during the reign of}} Charles I disrupted the systems of legal education and governance at the Inns of Court, shutting down all <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bar and new admissions, and Gray's Inn never fully recovered. Fortunes {{continued to}} decline after the English Restoration, which saw the end of the traditional method of legal education. Although now more prosperous, Gray's Inn is today the smallest of the Inns of Court.|$|E
5|$|Within its range, {{the western}} jackdaw is unmistakable; its short bill and grey nape are {{distinguishing}} features. From a distance, {{it can be}} confused with a rook (Corvus frugilegus), or when in flight, with a pigeon or chough. Flying western jackdaws are distinguishable from other corvids by their smaller size, faster and deeper wingbeats and proportionately narrower and less fingered wing tips. They also have shorter, thicker necks, much shorter bills and frequently fly in tighter flocks. They can be distinguished from choughs by their uniformly grey underwings and their black beaks and legs. The western jackdaw is very similar in morphology, behaviour, and <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Daurian jackdaw, with which its range overlaps in western Asia. Adults are readily distinguished, since the Daurian has a pied plumage, but immature birds are much more similar, both species having dark plumage and dark eyes. The Daurian tends to be darker, with a less contrasting nape than the Western.|$|E

5|$|On September16, strong waves {{produced}} by the hurricane disabled the Swedish freighter Laponia, {{which at the time}} was located 300mi (480km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The ship was initially en route for Rio de Janeiro carrying cargo for the Bethlehem Steel Company. As a result of the stranded ship, the SS President Roosevelt was forced to divert its course in order to render aid. The United States Coast Guard cutters USCGC Sebago (WHEC-42) and USCGC Carrabasset (WAT-55) were sent from the Virginia Capes in order to provide assistance. In addition, a coast guard plane was dispatched from Elizabeth City, North Carolina. The ships remained on standby to monitor the Laponia for three hours before conditions were considered safe to tow the stricken ship back to shore. Two fishing vessels capsized off Barnegat and Edgemere, New York, with both incidents resulting in a fatality. A cabin cruiser was sent to rescue occupants of the capsized boat off Edgemere, though it was also disrupted by rough seas. The ship was later able to rescue the other surviving crew members. Numerous other small craft off Long Island signaled distress <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US Coast Guard due to strong waves offshore. Eventually passing east of New England, the storm's large size resulted in heavy rainfall near Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. A weather station on the island reported maximum sustained winds of 45mph (70km/h). In Eastport, Maine, a weather station recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 993mbar (hPa; 29.33inHg) and wind speeds of 33mph (53km/h). In Maine, power lines were downed, damaging communications. In Bar Harbor, strong winds caused five fires, which were later extinguished. The schooner George Dresser ran aground on the port's coast. The hurricane also produced slight snowfalls in northern areas of the state.|$|E

25|$|JSON-RPC is {{a remote}} {{procedure}} call (RPC) protocol built on JSON, {{as a replacement for}} XML-RPC or SOAP.

JSON-RPC lets a system send notifications (information to the server that does not require a response) and multiple <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> server that can be answered out of order.|$|E
50|$|The {{operator}} that originates the <b>call</b> routes <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> donor operator.

This model is called indirect routing.|$|R

25|$|Walls and Lynn co-starred in the Aldwych productions, and Travers {{was careful}} to {{maintain}} the equilibrium of their stage partnership by ensuring that each had as many funny lines as the other.
