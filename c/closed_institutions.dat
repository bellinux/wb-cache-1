40|$|The {{proposal}} of complete smoking bans in <b>closed</b> <b>institutions,</b> such as prisons and psychiatric hospitals, creates {{a tension between}} individual "rights" {{and the health of}} all members of that community. Smokers in <b>closed</b> <b>institutions</b> generally smoke more, suffer more health consequences and are less likely to quit than smokers in other settings. Complete smoking bans do not cause an increase in behavioural problems, nor do bans cause worsening of mental illness or quality of life. Although infrequently tested, the responsibility of public institutions to protect others from second-hand smoke has usually outweighed any individual "right to smoke" in legal judgments. A substantial cultural shift may be required from considering smoking a "rare pleasure" during detention to the realisation that smoking is the most significant reversible health risk factor for this population. The implementation of complete smoking bans in <b>closed</b> <b>institutions</b> is challenging and requires careful and proactive planning by staff. As complete smoking bans are being considered in many institutions and jurisdictions, this column presents a review of the evidence base and ethical issues involved...|$|E

Methods Information on outbreaks were gathered from the reports made by epidemiological surveillance units. Direct costs (medical visits, hospital stays, drug treatment, sample processing, transport, diagnostic tests, monitoring {{and control of the}} outbreaks investigated) and indirect costs (lost productivity due to work absenteeism, caregivers time and working hours lost due to medical visits) were calculated. Results Twenty-seven outbreaks affecting 816 people in <b>closed</b> <b>institutions</b> and 74 outbreaks affecting 1, 940 people in the community were detected. The direct and indirect costs of outbreaks were ¿ 131, 997. 36 (¿ 4, 888. 79 per outbreak) in <b>closed</b> <b>institutions</b> and ¿ 260, 557. 16 (¿ 3, 521. 04 per outbreak) in community outbreaks. The cost per case was ¿ 161. 76 in outbreaks in <b>closed</b> <b>institutions</b> and ¿ 134. 31 in community outbreaks.
