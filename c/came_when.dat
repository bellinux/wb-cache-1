5|$|A {{separate}} highway {{bore the}} M-134 designation in the Lower Peninsula {{from the late}} 1920s to the late 1930s. The current highway's immediate predecessors {{were included in the}} original M-4 in the state. That designation was renumbered to the current M-134 moniker in 1939. Since the trunkline number was finalized, it was extended eastward to end south of Goetzville in the 1950s, with a further extension to De Tour in the 1950s. The western section was moved closer to the lakeshore in the 1960s. The last change <b>came</b> <b>when</b> M-134 was extended to Drummond Island in 1989.|$|E

5|$|In the U.S. National Championships, Richard Sears (1881–1887), William Larned (1901–1902, 1907–1911) and Bill Tilden (1920–1925, 1929) {{hold the}} record for most titles in the men's singles, with seven {{victories}} each. Four of Sears' wins and all of Larned's, came within the challenge round format, and they won respectively only thrice and twice after going through a complete draw. Sears also holds the all-time record for most consecutive titles, with seven from (1881 to 1887); the first win <b>came</b> <b>when</b> the event was closed to foreign participants. Without the challenge round, the record stands at six, and is held by Tilden (1920–1925).|$|E

Her only defeat of the year <b>came</b> <b>when</b> she was beaten when starting favourite for The Derby.|$|E
5|$|Manitoba's early economy {{depended}} on mobility and {{living off the}} land. Aboriginal Nations (Cree, Ojibwa, Dene, Sioux and Assiniboine) followed herds of bison and congregated to trade among themselves at key meeting places throughout the province. After {{the arrival of the}} first European traders in the 17th century, the economy centred on the trade of beaver pelts and other furs. Diversification of the economy <b>came</b> <b>when</b> Lord Selkirk brought the first agricultural settlers in 1811, though the triumph of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) over its competitors ensured the primacy of the fur trade over widespread agricultural colonization.|$|E
