40|$|The {{efficient}} {{setup and}} deployment of modern {{radio frequency identification}} (RF-ID) systems operating at 13. 56 MHz require an accurate knowledge of the reading range associated to the reader unit. To evaluate the reading range, an efficient simulative approach is analyzed in this paper, based on the evaluation of scattering parameters and a computer aided design (CAD) modeling. In particular, a two-port numerical model is considered and the parameter S 2, 1 analyzed. The purpose is to propose an efficient and original approach, based on S-parameters, in order to characterize an RF-ID system at 13. 56 MHz in terms of reading range. Some key working conditions of RF-ID systems are also analyzed in terms of inductive coupling between reader and <b>tag</b> <b>coils...</b>|$|R
40|$|The chapter {{presents}} innovative planar antennas for {{beam steering}} and {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) applications. Beam steering has become vital in commercial wireless communications, including mobile satellite communications where high data rate communication is required. The chapter describes a low-cost beam-steering antenna based on a leaky-wave antenna structure {{that is capable of}} steering the main radiation beam of the antenna over a large range from − 30 ° to + 15 °. Interest in RFID systems operating in the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) is rapidly growing as it offers benefits of long read range and low cost, which make it an excellent system for use in distribution and logistics systems. This chapter presents a technique of overcoming the limitations of conventional HF <b>coils</b> in RFID <b>tags</b> where the total length of the spiral antenna is restricted inside the available area of the tag...|$|R
40|$|Detection {{of vehicle}} {{position}} {{is critical for}} successful operation of intelligent transportation system. In case of railroad transportation systems, position information of railroad vehicles can be detected by GPS, track circuits, and so on. In this paper, position detection based on tags onto sleepers of the track is investigated. Position information stored in the tags is read by a reader placed {{at the bottom of}} running railroad vehicle. Due to limited capacity of battery or its alternative in the tags, power required for transmission of position information to the reader is harvested by the tags from the power wirelessly transferred from the reader. Basic mechanism in wireless power transfer is magnetic induction and power transfer efficiency according to the relative location of the reader to a tag is discussed with simulation results. Since power transfer efficiency is significantly affected by the ferromagnetic material (steel) {{at the bottom of the}} railroad vehicle and the track, magnetic beam shaping by ferrite material is carried out. With the ferrite material for magnetic beam shaping, degradation of power transfer efficiency due to the steel is substantially reduced. Based on the experimental results, successful wireless power transfer to the <b>tag</b> <b>coil</b> is possible when transmitted power from the reader coil is close to a few watts.

40|$|Purpose/Introduction: Continuous {{arterial}} spin labelling is {{the most}} sensitive technique for perfusion measurements. Several schemes for tag and control scans have been developped to overcome the technical and condeptual problems of this technique. Here, four different approaches for tag and control are simulated and compared experimentally. Subjects and Methods: Four sequence variants are compared that differ only {{in the way the}} tag or control pulses are applied: In CASL, separate <b>tagging</b> <b>coils</b> at the neck label the inflowing blood with one long pulse [1]. In ACASL, the tag is applied by the same coil used for imaging [2], but, due to technical constraints, this pulse has to be interrupted at regular intervals. For multi-slice acquisition (ms-ACASL) the control scan uses an oscillating pulse to avoid nonsymmetric magnetization transfer effects [3]. In PCASL [4], the tag is composed {{of a large number of}} short pulses and gradient shapes, with the control scan modifying the puls phases as to be transparent to the flowing spins. These four tagging techniques have been simulated and implemented on a Siemens Trio with an EPI-readout. The simulations were used to optimize the parameters of all sequences. Results: Two volunteers were examined with each of the four techniques, as well as with a standard FAIR sequence as representative of pulsed ASL. For all CASL measurements, the tagging duration was 2 s; with a delay of 1 s before acquiring 7 slices (ss-ACASL: 1 slice). Only the center slice was used for futher analysis. Figure 1 shows the perfusion images as generated with FSL from the same slice in one volunteer acquired with all five sequences. Voxels with a significant perfusion signal (Z = 3. 7) are red. Sensitivity differences between the sequences result in a different number of significant voxels...|$|R
