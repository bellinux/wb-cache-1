5|$|The {{previously}} described study by Timby et al. (2015) also assessed {{the effects of}} MFGM supplementation in term infants on the risk of infectious diseases and other disease symptoms. In particular, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> of acute otitis media was analyzed between the two randomized feeding groups (control formula or MFGM- supplemented formula to 6 months of age), and compared to a breastfed reference group. The MFGM-supplemented group experienced {{a significant reduction in}} episodes of acute otitis media up to 6 months of age compared with infants fed control formula (1% vs 9%; P=0.034); with no significant difference in otitis media incidence compared to the breastfed group (0%). In addition, a significantly lower incidence and longitudinal prevalence of antipyretic drug use was seen in the MFGM-supplemented group (25%) compared with the control formula group (43%). Timby et al. (2017) further showed that the MFGM supplementation influenced the infants’ oral microbiota; the authors noted that, Moraxella catarrhalis, a common bacterial cause of acute otitis media, was less prevalent in infants fed the MFGM-supplemented formula than in those fed control formula.|$|E

40|$|Background: Few studies {{thus far}} have {{compared}} head-to-head different non-myelooablative conditioning regimens for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Methods: Here, we report {{the results of}} a phase II multicenter randomized study comparing non-myeloablative allo-HCT from HLA-identical siblings (n = 54) or from 10 / 10 HLA-matched unrelated donors (n = 40) with either fludarabine plus 2 Gy total body irradiation (Flu-TBI arm; n = 49) or 8 Gy TLI + anti-thymocyte globulin (TLI-ATG arm; n = 45) conditioning. Results: The 180 -day <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidences</b> of grade II-IV acute GVHD (primary endpoint) were 12. 2 % versus 8. 9 % in Flu-TBI and TLI-ATG patients, respectively (P = 0. 5). Two-year <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidences</b> of moderate/severe chronic GVHD were 40. 8 % versus 17. 8 % in Flu-TBI and TLI-ATG patients, respectively (P = 0. 017). Five Flu-TBI patients and 10 TLI-ATG patients received pre-emptive DLI for low donor chimerism levels, while 1 Flu-TBI patient and 5 TLI-ATG patients (including 2 patients given prior pre-emptive DLIs) received a second HCT for poor graft function, graft rejection, or disease progression. Four-year <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidences</b> of relapse/progression were 22 % and 50 % in Flu-TBI and TLI-ATG patients, respectively (P = 0. 017). Four-year <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidences</b> of nonrelapse mortality were 24 % and 13 % in Flu-TBI and TLI-ATG patients, respectively (P = 0. 5). Finally, 4 -year overall (OS) and progression-free survivals (PFS) were 53 % and 54 %, respectively, in the Flu-TBI arm, versus 54 % (P = 0. 9) and 37 % (P = 0. 12), respectively, in the TLI-ATG arm. Conclusions: In comparison to patients included in the Flu-TBI arm, patients included in the TLI-ATG arm had lower incidence of chronic GVHD, higher incidence of relapse and similar OS. © 2015 Baron et al.; licensee Biomed Central...|$|R

Design A nationwide cohort study. Setting Data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients Uraemic cohort and matched controls were selected from among hospitalised patients with a primary diagnosis of peptic ulcer bleeding. In total, 6447 uraemic patients and 25 788 age-, gender-and gastroprotective agent use-matched controls were selected.

The NNH to increase a peptic ulcer rebleeding by ESRD at 1, 5 and 10 years were 22, 15 and 15, respectively. On multivariate analysis, ESRD (HR= 1. 38, p< 0. 0001) was an independent risk factor for rebleeding. Compared with matched controls, ESRD was associated with higher risk of rebleeding especially in patients using ulcerogenic agents (HR= 1. 33 - 1. 45), indication to prescribe gastroprotective agents (HR= 1. 44) and with liver cirrhosis (HR= 1. 45).

This can be improved by disease activity-guided dose reduction (DR). We aimed to assess long-term outcomes of TNFi DR in RA by using 3 -year data from the DRESS study (Dose REduction Strategy of Subcutaneous TNF inhibitors study). METHODS: In the intervention phase (month 0 - 18) of the DRESS study (Dutch trial register, NTR 3216), patients were randomised to DR or usual care (UC). In the extension phase (month 18 - 36), treatment strategies in both groups converged to continuation of protocolised tight control and allowed dose optimisation. Intention-to-treat analyses were done on flare, disease activity (28 joint count-based disease activity score with C reactive protein (DAS 28 -CRP)), functioning (health assessment questionnaire-disability index (HAQ-DI)), quality of life (Euroqol 5 dimensions 5 levels questionnaire (EQ 5 D- 5 L)), medication use, radiographic progression (Sharp van der Heijde score (SvdH)) and AE. RESULTS: 172 / 180 patients included in the DRESS study {{were included in the}} extension phase. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>incidences</b> of major flare were 10 % and 12 % (- 2 %, 95 % CI - 8 to 15) in DR and UC groups in the extension phase, and 17 % and 14 % (3 %, 95 % CI - 9 to 13) from 0 to 36 months. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>incidences</b> of short-lived flares were 43 % (33 to 52 %) %) and 35 % (23 to 49 %) %) in DR and UC groups in the extension phase, and 83 % (75 to 90 %) %) and 44 % (31 to 58 %) %) from 0 to 36 months. Mean DAS 28 -CRP, HAQ-DI, EQ 5 D- 5 L and SvdH remained stable and not significantly different between groups.

This {{article describes the}} efficacy, safety, and tolerability of this agent over 8 years. Methods: Postmenopausal osteoporotic women having participated in the 5 -year efficacy trials SOTI and TROPOS were invited to enter a 3 -year open-label extension study. The results presented here focus on patients who received strontium ranelate for 8 years. Results: At the extension baseline, the population treated for 8 years (n = 879; 79. 1 +/- 5. 6 years) had femoral neck T-score of - 2. 61 +/- 0. 71. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidences</b> of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures (13. 7 % and 12. 0 %, respectively) over years 6 to 8 were non-statistically different from the <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidences</b> in the first 3 years of the original studies (11. 5 % and 9. 6 %). Lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip bone mineral density (BMD) increased throughout the 8 -year period. Annual relative change in BMD was significant at every visit, except the 8 -year visit for femoral neck and total hip BMD. Strontium ranelate was safe and well tolerated over 8 years. Conclusions: Long-term treatment with strontium ranelate 2 g/day in postmenopausal osteoporotic women leads to continued increases in BMD at all sites. The data also provide some evidence for a sustained antifracture efficacy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the Risk-Assessment-and-Management-Programme(RAMP-HT) for HT patients in Hong Kong. Methodology: A prospective cohort study was conducted for 42, 490 RAMP-HT participants and {{the same number of}} propensity-score-matched HT patients receiving usual primary care in Hong Kong between October 2011 and March 2013, who were without CVD at baseline. The effectiveness measures were <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidences</b> of all-cause mortality and CVD including coronary heart disease, heart failure and stroke over 3 years. Using a bottom-up approach, the programme costs including set-up costs, ongoing intervention costs and central administrative costs of RAMP-HT were estimated from public health service provider’s perspective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated by dividing the incremental costs by the incremental effectiveness of the RAMP-HT group compared to those of the usual care group. Results: Significantly lower <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidences</b> of any CVD complications(3. 6 % vs 4. 6 %,p< 0. 001) and all-cause mortality(2. 1 % vs 4. 8 %,p< 0. 001) were observed in the RAMP-HT group compared to the usual care group. The 3 -year mean programme cost of RAMP-HT was US$ 52 per participant. The RAMP-HT costed US$ 5, 452 and US$ 1, 973 to reduce one CVD and death over 3 years, respectively.

Inhibitor development was studied in five-year birth cohorts comparing <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidences.</b> Furthermore the risk for inhibitor development per fiveyear birth cohort was studied using multivariable Cox regression, adjusting for potential genetic and treatment-related confounders. A total of 926 PUPs were included with a total <b>cumulative</b> inhibitor <b>incidence</b> of 27. 5 %. The inhibitor incidence increased from 19. 5 % in 1990 – 1994 (lowest) to 30. 9 % in 2000 – 2004 (highest; p-value 0. 011). Low titre inhibitor incidence increased from 3. 1 % in 1990 – 1994 to 10. 5 % in 2005 – 2009 (p-value 0. 009). High titre inhibitor incidences remained stable over time. After 2000, risk of all inhibitor development was increased with adjusted hazard ratios 1. 96 (95 % CI 1. 06 – 2. 83) in 2000 – 2004 and 2. 34 (1. 42 – 4. 92) in 2005 – 2009.

The standard Kaplan–Meier method was used to determine post-SRS survival. Competing risk analysis was applied to estimate <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidences</b> of neurological death, neurological deterioration, local recurrence, re-SRS for new lesions and SRS-induced complications. Post-SRS median survival times (MSTs) did not differ between the two groups; 7. 8 months in group A versus 7. 4 months in group B patients (HR 1. 064, 95 [*]% CI 0. 963 – 1. 177, p[*]=[*] 0. 22). However, <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidences</b> of neurological death (HR 1. 637, 95 [*]% CI 1. 174 – 2. 281, p[*]=[*] 0. 0036) and neurological deterioration (HR 1. 425, 95 [*]% CI 1. 073 – 1. 894, p[*]=[*] 0. 014) were significantly lower in the group A than in the group B patients. Neurologically asymptomatic patients undergoing SRS for BM had better results than symptomatic patients in terms of both maintenance of good neurological state and prolonged neurological survival. Thus, we conclude that screening computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging is highly beneficial for managing cancer patients...|$|R
