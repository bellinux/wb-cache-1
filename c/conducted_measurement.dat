30|$|Although the {{paradigm}} shift in wireless spectrum regulatory approaches {{is based on}} the assumption that the majority of wireless spectra are extensively underutilized by the incumbent license holders, who rely on several independently <b>conducted</b> <b>measurement</b> campaigns, there still exists a definite need to obtain a deeper understanding of this natural resource. By gaining insights into wireless spectrum occupancy characteristics, appropriate technical and legislative actions can be taken in order to support continued growth in the wireless sector. In this paper, we present a statistical analysis for the wireless spectrum occupancy across the spatial, temporal, and frequency dimensions using measurements collected in four mid-size US cities, namely, Rochester, NY; Buffalo, NY; Pittsburgh, PA; Worcester, MA. Although we have collected these measurements across several bands within the 88 [*]MHz– 3 [*]GHz frequency range, results pertaining to only certain bands are presented for the purpose of brevity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Monitoring {{end-to-end}} {{paths in}} an overlay network {{is essential for}} evaluating end-system performance and for troubleshooting anomalous behavior. However, <b>conducting</b> <b>measurements</b> between all pairs of overlay nodes can be cumbersome and expensive, especially in a large network. In this paper, we take a different approach and explore an additional degree of freedom, namely, monitoring native links. We allow native link measurements, as well as end-to-end overlay measurements, {{in order to minimize}} the total cost of monitoring the network. We formulate an optimization problem that, when solved, identifies the optimal set of native and overlay links to monitor, and a feasible sequence of arithmetic operations to perform for inferring characteristics of the overlay links that are not monitored directly. We use simulations to investigate how various topological properties may affect the best monitoring strategy. We also <b>conduct</b> <b>measurements</b> over the PlanetLab network to quantify the accuracy of different monitoring strategies. ...|$|R

For the purpose of simplifying the calibration procedure, a closed form approximation is introduced and applied to BHU- 2 D, which is used to correct the errors caused by threshold offset of the quantizer. Error analysis of this approximation shows that the method is applicable in SAIRs. In order to verify the design and calibration method, a series of validation experiments have been <b>conducted.</b> <b>Measurement</b> results have proved that the performance of the correlation unit could meet the requirements of BHU- 2 D. 1...|$|E
30|$|Mandeep et al. (2011) <b>conducted</b> <b>measurement</b> at USM {{during the}} El Niño year with {{lengthened}} dry season. The measurement site is at 57  m {{above sea level}} compared to ITB which is at 700  m above sea level and during the La Niña year. The antenna elevation angles at USM and ITB are at 40.10 ° and 64.70 ° with antenna diameters of 2.4 and 1.8  m, respectively, which highlights that the scintillation amplitude decreases as the elevation angle increases and increases as the antenna diameter increases. For example, at 0.1 % of the time, the fade scintillation amplitude is 1.3  dB at USM and 0.5  dB at ITB. The average temperatures at USM and ITB were around 27 °C and 23 °C, respectively, during the measured years. This indicates that the scintillation intensity reduces as the temperature reduces. Overall, the findings show that the elevation angle, altitude, and temperature do affect the intensity of tropospheric scintillation.|$|E

The <b>conducted</b> <b>measurement</b> confirmed {{the fact that when}} the frequency converter is used, vacuum fluctuation in stabilised condition is at the same level as when the control valve is used.
