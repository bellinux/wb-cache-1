An active investor may buy a property, make repairs and/or improvements to the property, and sell it later for a profit.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the long-run impact of inflation tax {{in the context}} of a generalized Ak growth model in which the rate of <b>capital</b> <b>depreciation</b> is endogenously determined. It is assumed that the rate of <b>capital</b> <b>depreciation</b> positively depends on capital utilization rate and negatively depends on maintenance spending. Money is introduced via a cash in advance constraint that may apply to the maintenance expenditure as well as to consumption and investment spending. We find that the long-run effects of inflation tax are more complex than those obtained in the monetary Ak growth model with a fixed <b>capital</b> <b>depreciation</b> rate. In particular, the relation between inflation and growth is highly sensitive to the specifications of the <b>capital</b> <b>depreciation</b> technology as well as to the forms of cash-in-advance constraint. ...|$|E

30|$|From 1850 to 2000, one of {{the engines}} of growth was the {{progressive}} conversion of Spain from a rural economy to {{a system in which}} the industry and the tertiary sector play the most important roles. Although most of the consequences of the industrialization and tertiarization of the economy has already been captured by the labor-augmenting technological progress, this process is also partly reflected by the change in the labor share and the depreciation of capital. To capture the effect of the change in labor share and <b>capital</b> <b>depreciation</b> on our results, we run two additional experiments assuming a constant labor share of two-thirds, which corresponds to that reported by Prados de la Escosura and Rosés (2010 b) for 1850, and another with a constant <b>capital</b> <b>depreciation</b> rate at the level of 1850. Prados de la Escosura and Rosés estimate that the labor share in Spain was below two-thirds {{from the beginning of the}} twentieth century until the 1930 s, it was above two-thirds from 1930 until World War II, witnessed a sharp decline at the beginning of the 1950 s, and recovered to pre-Civil War levels after the Stabilization Plan in 1959. The initial <b>capital</b> <b>depreciation</b> rate is estimated at 5.24 %, while the <b>capital</b> <b>depreciation</b> rate at the beginning of the twenty-first century is slightly above 6 %. We also include in the <b>capital</b> <b>depreciation</b> series the estimated 7 % productive capital destruction during the Civil War (Prados de la Escosura and Rosés 2010 a). Table 5 reports that the change in the labor share over the period 1850 – 2000 positively contributed by 7.1 % points to per-capita income growth, whereas the increase of the <b>capital</b> <b>depreciation</b> affected per capita income growth negatively by 1.6 %.|$|E

In contrast to other studies that do not explicitly focus on family-related career interruptions, we find that short-term human <b>capital</b> <b>depreciation</b> during these career interruptions is significantly lower in female occupations than in male occupations. This holds for both high- and low-skilled occupations. Our findings support the self-selection hypothesis with respect to occupational sex segregation, i. e. women might deliberately choose female occupations because of lower short-term wage penalties for family-related career interruptions. Moreover, we find that particularly men employed in high-skilled male occupations face large short-run as well as long run wage penalties when they have a family related career break. education, training and the labour market;...|$|E
