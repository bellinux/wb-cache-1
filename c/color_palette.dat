5|$|Although Max Allan Collins (then a Dick Tracy comic-strip writer) had {{conflicts}} with Disney concerning the novelization, {{he gave a}} positive review for the finished film. He praised Beatty for hiring an elaborate design team and his decision to mimic the strip's limited <b>color</b> <b>palette.</b> Collins also enjoyed Beatty's performance, both the prosthetic makeup and characterization of the rogues gallery, {{as well as the}} Stephen Sondheim music. However, he believed the filmmakers still sacrificed the storyline in favor of the visual design.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} {{built for the}} Adobe Flash platform in 2010 as indie game artist Wohlwend's first self-developed game. The game idea came from staring at the ceiling, and Wohlwend applied a grayscale <b>color</b> <b>palette</b> from {{his first year in}} art school. When Flash game sites did not purchase the title, he open sourced the code. Eric Johnson of Semi Secret ported the game to iPad, which began a collaboration between Wohlwend and the company's Adam Saltsman, who became the primary puzzle designer.|$|E
5|$|As a character, Scar has {{garnered}} widespread acclaim from film critics, who greeted Irons' {{performance with}} equal enthusiasm. However, Scar's violence, dark <b>color</b> <b>palette</b> and allegedly effeminate mannerisms were initially met with mild controversy, perceived {{by some as}} racist and homophobic. Nevertheless, Scar continues to be revered as one of Disney's greatest villains by various media publications, topping The Huffington Posts list and ranking within the top ten of similar lists published by Yahoo! Movies, the Orlando Sentinel, E! and CNN. Scar has also been ranked among the greatest villains in film history by Digital Spy and Entertainment Weekly.|$|E

5|$|The {{developer}} and {{producer of the}} original Metroid for the Nintendo Entertainment System – Nintendo Research & Development 1 (Nintendo R) and Gunpei Yokoi – returned to develop Metroid II. The developers of the game added round metal shoulders on Samus' Varia Suit to differentiate it from her Power Suit, since both looked similar on the Game Boy's limited greyscale display. The updated suit has since been {{a staple of the}} series, appearing in all subsequent games. A unique <b>color</b> <b>palette</b> for Metroid II was added to the Game Boy Color console, a successor to the original Game Boy with a color screen.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews and}} sales estimates ranged from subpar to par. Reviewers praised Kameo graphics as setting {{standards for the}} new console, and noted its vivid <b>color</b> <b>palette.</b> Their criticism focused on the gameplay, in particular its repetition, awkward controls, easy combat, disorganized introduction, and overbearing tutorial. Reviewers found the story and Kameo's character lackluster, but largely liked the other characters and the core morphing concept. They had high praise for the orchestral score and other technical features, apart from the game's camera. Rare released several cosmetic downloadable content packs, and a free online cooperative mode upgrade.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} for Anachronox is turn-based; {{the player}} controls {{a party of}} up to three characters as they explore a 3D environment of futuristic cities, space vessels, and outdoor areas. Inspirations for the game include older role-playing video games such as Chrono Trigger and the Final Fantasy series, animator Chuck Jones and the novel Ender's Game. The game was built with a heavily {{modified version of the}} Quake II engine, rewritten chiefly to allow a wider <b>color</b> <b>palette,</b> emotive animations and facial expressions, better lighting, particle, and camera effects.|$|E

5|$|After Type-0 {{received}} a 2011 Japan-only release on PSP, Type-0 HD began development in mid-2012 {{as part of}} a move to promote the next generation of gaming consoles, and gave the opportunity for multiple changes to refine the experience for players. Outside of updated graphics and an expanded <b>color</b> <b>palette,</b> Type-0 HD is largely identical to the original PSP version, although the original's multiplayer functionality was dropped, and additional difficulty levels were implemented. Type-0 HD reached high positions in international sales charts, and has sold over one million copies worldwide as of October 2015. It received praise for its story and battle system, while criticisms have focused on its HD upgrade and localization.|$|E
5|$|Development for Firewatch {{began with}} a single {{painting}} by Moss. Jane Ng, lead environmental artist at Campo Santo, was tasked with translating Moss' work into 3D environments while maintaining his stylized artistic vision. Moss, who had previously been known primarily for his graphic design work, had joined Vanaman and Rodkin to found Campo Santo after spending many years working {{on the periphery of}} game development. In creating the painting, Moss emulated National Park Service posters from the New Deal era in both <b>color</b> <b>palette</b> and iconography. The development team went on a camping trip to Yosemite National Park for inspiration for the game, where they visited a lookout tower built with the same design as its video game counterpart. Further inspiration for the game came from Vanaman and Anderson's experiences growing up in rural Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|James J. Murakami {{supervised}} the production design. Location scouting revealed {{that many of}} the older buildings in Los Angeles had been torn down, including the entire neighborhood where Collins lived. Suburban areas in San Dimas, San Bernardino and Pasadena doubled for 1920s Los Angeles instead. The Old Town district of San Dimas stood in for Collins' neighborhood and some adjacent locales. Murakami said Old Town was chosen because very little had changed since the 1920s. It was used for interiors and exteriors; the crew decorated the area with a subdued <b>color</b> <b>palette</b> to evoke feelings of comfort. For some exterior shots they renovated derelict properties in neighborhoods of Los Angeles that still possessed 1920s architecture. The crew staged {{the third floor of the}} Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles into a replica of the 1920s Los Angeles City Council chambers.|$|E

5|$|Although a real ninja wears {{black to}} be inconspicuous, Kishimoto gave Naruto an orange {{jumpsuit}} {{to fit the}} shōnen genre. His wardrobe is based on clothing that Kishimoto wore when he was younger. According to him, a pre-existing design {{would not have made}} Naruto unique, whereas something original would have made him too distinctive. Because Naruto is associated with spirals in terms of objects he uses, the designer incorporated swirl patterns into the costume. Initial illustrations depicted Naruto in boots, but Kishimoto replaced these with sandals, because he enjoys drawing toes. The goggles Naruto used to wear were replaced with a hitai-ite, or shinobi headband, because they were too time-consuming to draw. One of the most difficult design choices was the <b>color</b> <b>palette</b> of Naruto's outfit. The orange in his costume makes Naruto pop and the blue parts are complementary. Kishimoto apologized to the anime staff for Naruto's design, as he considered it too difficult to animate.|$|E
5|$|At Tabata's suggestion, Naora {{expanded}} the <b>color</b> <b>palette</b> {{to increase the}} game's realism and tie in with XVs art style. The original idea was to change the original red hue to a golden one to match the redone logo, but the graphics looked too dark on the large screen even with the adjustment, so blue tones were added to brighten up the scenery. Additional bass sounds {{were added to the}} sound effects, as the original platform's speaker system had previously limited the range and strength of sounds. The original camera behavior needed to be developed from scratch, as the camera angles used in the original looked out of place on the large screen. During the run-up to release, the team made modifications to the camera after receiving negative comments during demonstrations, addressing scenery collisions and the visibility of player and enemy characters during active gameplay. Because of these modifications, character speed and movement could be increased and improved. By December 2014, the game was in its final stages of development and undergoing debugging.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{created the}} game using 96K of memory, which limited the file size of individual graphics and sound effects they could use. The memory limits also prohibited Newcomer from creating more characters. The graphics were created at the pixel level and hand-animated. To animate the birds, Hendricks used Eadweard Muybridge's book Animals In Motion as a reference. Given the limited memory, {{she had to}} balance the number of frames to minimize file size, while maintaining realistic animation. Hendricks originally picked gray for the buzzards, but chose green instead to optimize the <b>color</b> <b>palette</b> as the developers had only 16colors to create the visuals. Once the colors were decided for the character sprites, Newcomer finalized {{the look of the}} platforms. The hardware had limited audio capabilities, and sounds typically required larger amounts of memory than graphics. Working with these restrictions, Newcomer instructed Murphy and Kotlarik to focus on select sounds he deemed important to reinforcing gameplay. He reasoned that the audio would serve as conspicuous hints that players could use to adjust their strategy. Though Newcomer prioritized the wing flap, other sound effects like those related to the pterodactyl, collisions, and hatching eggs were considered important as well.|$|E

5000|$|These {{palettes}} each contain {{up to ten}} colors. [...] In most games, {{the four}} shades displayed on the original Game Boy would translate to different subsets of this 10-color palette, such as by displaying movable sprites in one subset and backgrounds, etc. in another.

5|$|To {{bring these}} areas to life, the level {{designers}} produced game mechanic elements using simple room layouts and shapes, while concept artists worked in tandem to create artwork for each location, following the art direction. Environment artists would then build 3D layouts {{based on those}} designs. Finding an appropriate <b>color</b> <b>palette</b> for the game world was difficult; browns and monochromatic colors could depict the desired dark and moody atmosphere, but the developers wanted the aesthetic to resemble the vibrant color schemes of a comic book. To this end, they used saturated colors for in-game lighting. Lighting was {{an important component of}} the game, being used to highlight points of interest and to draw the player onward in otherwise boring corridors. To maintain the intended level of detail and allow the game's console versions to fit into the devices' memory, each area had to be streamed in and out of memory seamlessly to free up memory for textures and geometry. All of the cutscenes were storyboarded by Rocksteady artists, being visualized in the game engine before the character performances were motion-captured. The design team decided that cutscenes should be used to advance character relationships, and that after each cutscene the player should have had their goal changed or the importance of their actions modified. Priority was given to keeping action scenes under the player's control rather than showing them in cutscenes.|$|E
5|$|While {{attending}} Waseda University, Saito played SimCity on the Macintosh, {{which prompted}} him to pursue video game creation after graduating. His first game was a simulation title {{that was part of}} a future media project for a publishing house. When Saito asked to develop a second, the business refused because it was not a video game company. He left the company to personally produce the second game, which built on ideas he conceived while working on his first: elevators and towers. Saito teamed up with freelance programmer Takumi Abe to complete the project. To research the gameplay, Saito contacted an elevator company to learn about elevator scheduling and management. However, the company declined to provide the information. Saito handled the graphic design, and started with a monochromatic scaled tower created in HyperCard. The designer added color to differentiate between office- and hotel-type buildings. As development neared completion, Saito noticed that the Mac's performance had improved and decided to increase the <b>color</b> <b>palette</b> size from 16 to 256colors. Saito enlisted a second designer to produce animation for the graphics and improve the details for the color increase.|$|E
