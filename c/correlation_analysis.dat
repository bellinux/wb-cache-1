This perturbation can be a systematic and controlled change in temperature, pressure, pH, chemical composition of the system, or even time after a catalyst was added to a chemical mixture.

This technique required sinusoidal perturbations to the chemical system under investigation. This {{specific type of}} the applied perturbation severely limited its possible applications. Following research done by several groups of scientists, perturbation based 2D spectroscopy could be developed to a more extended and generalized broader base. Since the development of generalized 2D <b>correlation</b> <b>analysis</b> in 1993 based on Fourier transformation of the data, 2D <b>correlation</b> <b>analysis</b> gained widespread use. Alternative techniques that were simpler to calculate, for example the disrelation spectrum, were also developed simultaneously. Because of its computational efficiency and simplicity, the Hilbert transform is nowadays used for the calculation of the 2D spectra. To date, 2D <b>correlation</b> <b>analysis</b> {{is used for the}} interpretation of many types of spectroscopic data (including XRF, UV/VIS spectroscopy, fluorescence, infrared, and Raman spectra), although its application is not limited to spectroscopy.|$|E
2500|$|When one {{considers}} spectra that consist of few bands, {{it is quite}} obvious to determine which bands are subject to a changing intensity. Such a changing intensity can be caused for example by chemical reactions.

Two dimensional <b>correlation</b> <b>analysis</b> allows one to determine at which positions in such a measured signal there is a systematic change in a peak, either continuous rising or drop in intensity. 2D <b>correlation</b> <b>analysis</b> results in two complementary signals, which referred to as the 2D synchronous and 2D asynchronous spectrum.

40|$|The antituberculotic {{activity}} of some polyhydroxyxanthones was estimated using the Molecular Descriptors Family on Structure Activity Relationships methodology. From a {{total number of}} 298110 real and distinct calculated descriptors, 94843 were significantly different and entered into multiple linear regression analysis. The best performing bi-varied model was obtained by use of all polyhydroxyxanthones. The MDF SAR model was validated splitting the molecules into training and test sets. A correlated <b>correlations</b> <b>analysis</b> was applied in other to compare the MDF SAR models with the previous SAR model. The prediction ability of antituberculotic {{activity of}} polyhydroxyxanthones with MDF SAR methodology is sustained by three arguments: leave-one-out procedure, training vs. test procedure, and the correlated <b>correlations</b> <b>analysis.</b> Looking at the bi-varied MDF SAR model, we can conclude that the antituberculotic activity of polyhydroxyxanthones is almost of geometrical nature (99 %) and {{is strongly dependent on}} partial atomic charge and group electronegativity...|$|R

2500|$|... 2D <b>correlation</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{frequently}} used for its main advantage: increasing the spectral resolution by spreading overlapping peaks over two dimensions {{and as a}} result simplification of the interpretation of one-dimensional spectra that are otherwise visually indistinguishable from each other. Further advantages are its ease of application and the possibility to make the distinction between band shifts and band overlap. Each type of spectral event, band shifting, overlapping bands of which the intensity changes in the opposite direction, band broadening, baseline change, etc. has a particular 2D pattern.

2500|$|Fluorescence {{correlation}} spectroscopy (FCS) [...] is a <b>correlation</b> <b>analysis</b> of fluctuation of the fluorescence intensity. The analysis provides {{parameters of the}} physics under the fluctuations. One of the interesting applications of this is {{an analysis of the}} concentration fluctuations of fluorescent particles (molecules) in solution. In this application, the fluorescence emitted from a very tiny space in solution containing a small number of fluorescent particles (molecules) is observed. The fluorescence intensity is fluctuating due to Brownian motion of the particles. In other words, the number of the particles in the sub-space defined by the optical system is randomly changing around the average number. The analysis gives the average number of fluorescent particles and average diffusion time, when the particle is passing through the space. Eventually, both the concentration and size of the particle (molecule) are determined. Both parameters are important in biochemical research, biophysics, and chemistry.|$|E

40|$|The {{asymptotically}} distributed free (ADF) {{method is}} often used to estimate parameters or test models without a normal distribution assumptions on variables, both in covariance structure <b>analysis</b> and in <b>correlation</b> structure <b>analysis.</b> However, little has been done to study the differences in behaviors of the ADF method in covariance structure <b>analysis</b> and <b>correlation</b> structure <b>analysis.</b> In this thesis the behaviors of the ADF method in covariance structure <b>analysis</b> and <b>correlation</b> structure <b>analysis</b> were studied for three test statistics, chi-square test T AGLS and its small-sample improvements T YB and T F(AGLS). Results showed that the ADF method in <b>correlation</b> structure <b>analysis</b> with test statistic T AGLS performs much better at small sample sizes than the corresponding test for covariance structures. However, test statistics T YB and T F(AGLS) under the same conditions generally perform better with covariance structures than with correlation structures. Results also showed that condition numbers of weight matrices are systematically increased with substantial increase in variance as sample size decreases.

40|$|Linear {{dimensionality}} reduction {{methods are}} {{a cornerstone of}} analyzing high dimensional data, due to their simple geometric interpretations and typically attractive computational properties. These methods capture many data features of interest, such as covariance, dy-namical structure, correlation between data sets, input-output relationships, and margin between data classes. Methods have been developed {{with a variety of}} names and motiva-tions in many fields, and perhaps as a result the connections between all these methods have not been highlighted. Here we survey methods from this disparate literature as opti-mization programs over matrix manifolds. We discuss principal component analysis, factor analysis, linear multidimensional scaling, Fisher’s linear discriminant <b>analysis,</b> canonical <b>correlations</b> <b>analysis,</b> maximum autocorrelation factors, slow feature analysis, sufficient di-mensionality reduction, undercomplete independent component analysis, linear regression, distance metric learning, and more. This optimization framework gives insight to some rarely discussed shortcomings of well-known methods, such as the suboptimality of certain eigenvector solutions. Modern techniques for optimization over matrix manifolds enable a generic linear dimensionality reduction solver, which accepts as input data and an ob-jective to be optimized, and returns, as output, an optimal low-dimensional projection of the data. This simple optimization framework further allows straightforward general-izations and novel variants of classical methods, which we demonstrate here by creating an orthogonal-projection canonical <b>correlations</b> <b>analysis.</b> More broadly, this survey and generic solver suggest that linear dimensionality reduction can move toward becoming a blackbox, objective-agnostic numerical technology...|$|R
