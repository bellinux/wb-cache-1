5|$|<b>Crumb</b> {{ended the}} strip in 1972 due to {{disagreements}} with the filmmakers. He published {{a story in}} which Fritz was murdered by an ex-girlfriend. A second animated film, The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat, was produced in 1974 without the involvement of either Bakshi or <b>Crumb.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{when he was}} {{not working}} at American Greetings, <b>Crumb</b> drew many Fritz the Cat strips for his own amusement. Some of these strips would later be {{published}} in Help! and Cavalier magazines and in the underground comix. Fritz also appears briefly in Crumb's graphic novel Big Yum Yum Book: The Story of Oggie and the Beanstalk, drawn in 1964, but not published until 1975. Several characters from the anthropomorphic universe of Fritz the Cat appeared in another <b>Crumb</b> comic strip, The Silly Pigeons, drawn in 1965 and intended for Help! In 1970, <b>Crumb</b> redrew an early Fuzzy the Bunny story written by Charles <b>Crumb</b> in 1952; it was published in Zap Comix #5.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, New York {{animator}} Ralph Bakshi {{came across}} a copy of R. Crumb's Fritz the Cat and suggested to producer Steve Krantz that it would work as a film. After meeting with Bakshi, <b>Crumb</b> loaned him one of his sketchbooks as a reference, but was unsure of the film's production and refused to sign the contract. Bakshi and <b>Crumb</b> were unable {{to reach an agreement}} after two weeks of negotiations but Krantz secured the film rights from Crumb's wife, Dana, who had a power of attorney. <b>Crumb</b> received $50,000, distributed over the course of production and ten percent of Krantz's proceeds.|$|E
40|$|Maintenance of {{epithelial}} polarity {{depends on}} the correct localization and levels of polarity determinants. The evolutionarily conserved transmembrane protein <b>Crumbs</b> is crucial for the size and identity of the apical membrane, yet {{little is known about}} the molecular mechanisms controlling the amount of <b>Crumbs</b> at the surface. Here, we show that <b>Crumbs</b> levels on the apical membrane depend on a well-balanced state of endocytosis and stabilization. The adaptor protein 2 (AP- 2) complex binds to a motif in the cytoplasmic tail of <b>Crumbs</b> that overlaps with the binding site of Stardust, a protein known to stabilize <b>Crumbs</b> on the surface. Preventing endocytosis by mutations in AP- 2 causes expansion of the Crumbs-positive plasma membrane and polarity defects, which can be partially rescued by removing one copy of <b>crumbs.</b> Strikingly, knocking-down both AP- 2 and Stardust retains <b>Crumbs</b> on the membrane. This study provides evidence for a molecular mechanism, based on stabilization and endocytosis, to adjust surface levels of <b>Crumbs,</b> which are essential for maintaining epithelial polarity...|$|R
40|$|<b>Crumbs</b> {{proteins}} {{are important}} regulators of epithelial polarity. In C. elegans, no essential {{role for the}} two described <b>Crumbs</b> homologs has been uncovered. Here, we identify and characterize an additional <b>Crumbs</b> family member in C. elegans, which we termed CRB- 3 based on its similarity in size and sequence to mammalian CRB 3. We visualized CRB- 3 subcellular localization by expressing a translational GFP fusion. CRB- 3 ::GFP was expressed in several polarized tissues in the embryo and larval stages, and showed apical localization in the intestine and pharynx. To identify {{the function of the}} <b>Crumbs</b> family in C. elegans development, we generated a triple <b>Crumbs</b> deletion mutant by sequentially removing the entire coding sequence for each <b>crumbs</b> homolog using a CRISPR/Cas 9 -based approach. Remarkably, animals lacking all three <b>Crumbs</b> homologs are viable and show normal epithelial polarity. Thus, the three C. elegans <b>Crumbs</b> family members do not appear to play an essential role in epithelial polarity establishment...|$|R

5|$|In 1978, Bélier Press {{published}} The Complete Fritz the Cat, {{which brought}} {{together all the}} published stories featuring Fritz, as well as previously unpublished drawings and unfinished comics. At the artist's request, a 10-page story drawn in 1964 and previously published in R. Crumb's Comics and Stories (Rip Off Press) in 1969 was excluded from this collection. In April 1993, Fantagraphics Books published The Life & Death of Fritz the Cat, compiling nine major strips, including the 1964 story previously excluded from The Complete Fritz the Cat. Fritz the Cat strips also appear in The Complete <b>Crumb</b> Comics series. An unpublished page featuring Fritz that had been intended for Help!, as well as comics featuring other characters related to the anthropomorphic universe of Fritz the Cat, appeared in The R. <b>Crumb</b> Coffee Table Art Book in 1998.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Ralph's Spot {{was founded}} as a {{division}} of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca-Cola and Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse, a series of educational shorts paid for by Encyclopædia Britannica. Bakshi was uninterested {{in the kind of}} animation the studio was turning out, and wanted to produce something personal. He soon developed Heavy Traffic, a tale of inner-city street life. Krantz told Bakshi that Hollywood studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. While browsing the East Side Book Store on St. Mark's Place, Bakshi came across a copy of Robert Crumb's Fritz the Cat. Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film. Krantz arranged a meeting with <b>Crumb,</b> during which Bakshi presented the drawings he had created while learning the artist's distinctive style to prove that he could adapt Crumb's artwork to animation. Impressed by Bakshi's tenacity, <b>Crumb</b> lent him one of his sketchbooks for reference.|$|E

40|$|The apical {{transmembrane protein}} <b>Crumbs</b> is {{necessary}} for both cell polarization and the assembly of the zonula adherens (ZA) in Drosophila epithelia. The apical spectrin-based membrane skeleton (SBMS) is a protein network that is essential for epithelial morphogenesis and ZA integrity, and exhibits close colocalization with <b>Crumbs</b> and the ZA in fly epithelia. These observations suggest that <b>Crumbs</b> may stabilize the ZA by recruiting the SBMS to the junctional region. Consistent with this hypothesis, we report that <b>Crumbs</b> {{is necessary for}} the organization of the apical SBMS in embryos and Schneider 2 cells, whereas the localization of <b>Crumbs</b> is not affected in karst mutants that eliminate the apical SBMS. Our data indicate that it is specifically the 4. 1 protein/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) domain binding consensus, and in particular, an arginine at position 7 in the cytoplasmic tail of <b>Crumbs</b> that is essential to efficiently recruit both the apical SBMS and the FERM domain protein, DMoesin. <b>Crumbs,</b> Discs lost, �Heavyspectrin, and DMoesin are all coimmunoprecipitated from embryos, confirming the existence of a multimolecular complex. We propose that <b>Crumbs</b> stabilizes the apical SBMS via DMoesin and actin, leading to reinforcement of the ZA and effectively coupling epithelial morphogenesis and cell polarity...|$|R

5|$|After {{the release}} {{and success of}} Fritz the Cat, several {{animated}} films meant for adults rather than children enjoyed success. Fritz, a film based on a character created by artist and illustrator Robert <b>Crumb,</b> was the first animated movie to receive an X rating in the United States. Charles Swenson developed Down and Dirty Duck as a project for former The Mothers of Invention band members Kaylan and Volman under the title Cheap! Had the film been released under this title, as director Mick Garris notes, the title would have been Roger Corman's Cheap! However, Roger Corman observed the title as a shot at his production techniques, and asked that the title be changed. The film's production budget was $110,000. According to Swenson, he created {{almost all of the}} animation himself, although publicity attributed the animation work to the Murakami-Wolf Production Company, with Academy Award Winning animator Fred Wolf, credited as his son's name, Bill Wolf, helped animate parts of the film personally. Although the film was promoted as an X-rated animated film, New World Pictures had not actually submitted it to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The film was also promoted as Dirty Duck, although the title on the film itself reads Down and Dirty Duck.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} financing {{from other}} sources, including Saul Zaentz (who agreed {{to distribute the}} soundtrack album on his Fantasy Records label), the budget was tight enough to exclude pencil tests, so Bakshi had to test the animation by flipping an animator's drawings in his hand before they were inked and painted. When a cameraman realized that the cels for the desert scenes were not wide enough and revealed the transparency, Bakshi painted a cactus to cover the mistake. Very few storyboards were used. Bakshi and Vita walked around the Lower East Side, Washington Square Park, Chinatown and Harlem, taking moody snapshots. Artist Ira Turek inked the outlines of these photographs onto cels with a Rapidograph, the technical pen preferred by <b>Crumb,</b> giving the film's backgrounds a stylized realism virtually unprecedented in animation. The tones of the watercolor backgrounds were influenced {{by the work of}} Ashcan School painters such as George Luks and John French Sloan. Among other unusual techniques, bent and fisheye camera perspectives were used to portray the way the film's hippies and hoodlums viewed the city. Many scenes featured documentary recordings of real conversations in place of scripted dialogue—this too would become a signature of Bakshi's.|$|E

40|$|Mutations in {{the human}} <b>Crumbs</b> {{homologue}} 1 (CRB 1) gene cause severe retinal dystrophies, ranging from retinitis pigmentosa to Leber congenital amaurosis. The CRB 1 gene is expressed specifically in human retina and brain and encodes a protein homologous to the Drosophila <b>Crumbs</b> protein. In <b>crumbs</b> mutant embryos apico-basal polarity of epithelial cells is lost, leading to widespread epidermal cell death. The small cytoplasmic domain of <b>Crumbs</b> organizes an intracellular protein scaffold that defines the assembly of a continuous zonula adherens. The <b>crumbs</b> mutant phenotype can be partially rescued by expression of just the membrane-bound cytoplasmic domain, and overexpression of this domain in a wild-type background results in a multilayered epidermis. A striking difference between CRB 1 and <b>Crumbs</b> was that the latter contains a transmembrane region and a 37 amino acid cytoplasmic domain. Here we describe an alternative splice variant of human CRB 1 that encodes a cytoplasmic domain 72 % {{similar to that of}} Drosophila <b>Crumbs.</b> Two intracellular subdomains that are necessary for function in Drosophila are absolutely conserved. Rescuing and overexpression studies in Drosophila show that the cytoplasmic domains are functionally related between these distant species. This suggests that CRB 1 organizes an intracellular protein scaffold {{in the human}} retina. Human homologues of proteins binding to <b>Crumbs</b> may be part of this complex and represent candidate genes for retinal dystrophies...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Crumbs</b> {{proteins}} (CRBs) are transmembrane proteins, homologous to Drosophila <b>Crumbs,</b> with a {{key role}} in defining the apical membrane domain in photoreceptors as well as in embryonic epithelia. <b>Crumbs</b> proteins are conserved between species and their intracellular domains are involved in organizing a conserved macromolecular protein scaffold with important roles in cell polarity as well as morphogenesis and maintenance of the retina. Mutations in the gene encoding human CRB 1, the first one identified out of the three human orthologs, have been associated with a number of retinal dystrophies including Leber amaurosis and retinitis pigmentosa type 12. Although no other mammalian <b>Crumbs</b> complex members as of yet have been associated with retinal degeneration, disruption of different zebrafish and fruitfly orthologs can lead to various retinal defects. The core <b>Crumbs</b> complex localizes apical to the outer limiting membrane, where photoreceptors and Muller glia contact each other. Correct functioning of <b>Crumbs</b> ensures adhesion between these cells by an unknown mechanism. This review summarizes the current view on the composition and function of the <b>Crumbs</b> prsotein complex in the mammalian retina. Recently, a number of new members of the <b>Crumbs</b> protein complex have been identified. These include most members of the membrane palmitoylated protein family (MPP), involved in assembly of macromolecular protein complexes. Some components of the complex are found to exert a function in the photoreceptor synapses and/or at the region of the connecting cilium.
