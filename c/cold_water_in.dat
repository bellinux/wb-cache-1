During filming, Henry Clive suddenly {{decided that he}} did not want to jump into the tank of <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> the scene, causing Chaplin to storm off the set and fire Clive. He was quickly replaced by Harry Myers, who Chaplin had known while under contract at Keystone Studios. Chaplin finished shooting the sequence on July 29, 1929 with exteriors at Pasadena Bridge. Chaplin then shot a sequence that was eventually cut from the film involving the Little Tramp attempting to retrieve a stick that was stuck in a wall. The scene included a young Charles Lederer; Chaplin later praised the scene, but insisted that it needed to be cut. He then continued filming the scenes with the millionaire until September 29, 1929.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} {{difference between the}} middle ear and the outside, if not released, {{can result in a}} burst eardrum. This damages hearing, and if this occurs underwater, <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> the middle ear chills the inner ear, causing vertigo.

The Tarzan Swing and the Cannonball ride in this area were operated by spring water.|$|E
25|$|The {{general idea}} behind hydropathy during the 1800s {{was to be}} able to induce {{something}} called a crisis. The thinking was that water invaded any cracks, wounds, or imperfections in the skin, which were filled with impure fluids. health was considered to be the natural state of the body, and filling these spaces with pure water, would flush the impurities out, which would rise {{to the surface of the}} skin, producing pus. The event of this pus emerging was called a crisis, and was achieved through a multitude of methods. These methods included techniques such as sweating, the plunging bath, the half bath, the head bath, the sitting bath, and the douche bath. All of these were ways to gently expose the patient to <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> different ways.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1968, after Deep Diver {{had been}} requisitioned by the United States Navy to help {{search for the}} lost {{submarine}} USS Scorpion, the Bureau of Ships determined that Deep Diver was unsafe for use at great depths or in extremely cold temperatures because of the substitution of {{the wrong kind of}} steel, which became brittle in <b>cold</b> <b>water,</b> <b>in</b> some parts of the sub. Link proceeded to design a new lockout sub with a distinctive acrylic bubble as the forward pilot/observer compartment. In January 1971 the new sub was launched and commissioned to the Smithsonian Institution. It was named the Johnson Sea Link after its donors, Link and his friend John Seward Johnson I. Deep Diver was decommissioned and donated to the Smithsonian Institution. It was placed on display at the Marine Sciences Center in Fort Pierce, Florida.|$|E

500|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} performs seasonal migrations following warm water masses. In the northwestern Atlantic, {{it is found}} {{in or near the}} Gulf Stream from December to April, and moves north of the Stream to gather near the continental shelf from July to September. A similar migration seems to occur in the Mediterranean, though the specifics are unknown. In the Pacific, this species apparently spends the winter in oceanic waters near the equator and move into higher latitudes and towards the coast in spring. Two Pacific populations are known: one migrates from near Central America to California, and the other from the central Pacific to as far as Japan and British Columbia. Off southeastern Brazil, {{pelagic stingray}}s are displaced towards the coast by upwellings of <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> late spring and summer; in some years they may even be pushed into inshore waters less than [...] deep.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the [...] "schoolroom", which was larger than the Town Public Hall, the building consisted of a dining hall (cum gymnasium), the masters common room {{to the east and}} a block of six classrooms to the west. The headmaster's house was completed {{at the same time as}} the main school building, and had five bedrooms wired with electric bells, and a bathroom plumbed with hot and <b>cold</b> <b>water.</b> <b>In</b> November 1920, an organ was built at a cost of over £1,000, and placed in the schoolroom as a memorial to the old boys and masters who died in the First World War. A new gymnasium was constructed after a 1956 survey deemed its predecessor economically irreparable. Accompanied by the construction of three hard tennis courts, it was opened by Sir Benjamin Brodie in 1958, but lacked adjoining changing rooms, washing facilities and office facilities for members of the physical education staff.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} the {{pressures}} on his time, Heber set out again on 30 January 1826, this time heading south for Madras (now Chennai), Pondicherry, Tanjore (Thanjavur) and ultimately Travancore. One reason for the tour {{was to examine the}} issue of caste, which persisted in the church in South India. In Tanjore on Easter Day, 26 March 1826, Heber preached to more than 1300, and on the following day conducted a confirmation service for a large Tamil congregation. On 1 April he moved on to Trichinopoly (Tiruchirappalli) where, next day, he confirmed 42 people. On 3 April, after attending an early-morning service at which he gave a blessing in the Tamil language, Heber returned to his bungalow for a cold bath. Immediately after plunging into the water he died, possibly from the shock of the <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> the intense heat. Watson records that a contemporary engraving shows his body [...] "being carried from the bath by his servant and chaplain, the latter immaculately attired in a frock coat and top hat". His funeral was held the next day at St John's church, where he had preached his final sermon; he was buried within the church, {{on the north side of}} the altar.|$|E

In the tropics where sunlight falls more directly, the temperature of the surface layers can rise to over near the poles, the temperature is in equilibrium with the sea ice at its freezing point. Its salinity makes this lower than freshwater's, usually about [...] These temperature differences contribute to the continuous circulation of water through the sea. Warm surface currents cool as they move away from the tropics; as the water becomes denser, it sinks. The <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> the deep sea moves back towards the equator before welling up again to the surface. Deep seawater has a temperature between [...] {{in all parts of the}} globe. In freezing seas, ice crystals begin to form on the surface. These break into small pieces and coalesce into flat discs that form a thick suspension known as frazil. In calm conditions, frazil will freeze into a thin, flat sheet called nilas, which thickens as new ice forms in the sea beneath it. In turbulent waters, frazil instead join together into larger flat discs known as [...] "pancakes". These slide over and under one another to form floes. During these processes, salt water and air are trapped amid the ice. Nilas forms with a salinity around 12–15‰ and is grayish in color but grows fresher over time: after a year, it is bluish and closer to 4–6‰ saline.|$|E

Hahn's writings had meanwhile created much enthusiasm among his countrymen, societies having been formed everywhere to promote the medicinal and dietetic use of water; and in 1804 Professor E.F.C. Oertel of Anspach republished them and quickened the popular movement by unqualified commendation of water drinking as a remedy for all diseases.|$|E

2500|$|To allow {{successful}} equalization when diving, it {{is important}} that the diving suit hood does not make an airtight seal over the outside ear hole, and that earplugs are not worn. It is not recommended to dive when a eustachian tube is congested or blocked, e.g. with the common cold, as this may cause what is known as a reverse block. [...] Descent is uninhibited as the Valsalva maneuver may still clear the eustachian tubes temporarily by force, but during ascent a blockage may stop the air in the middle ear (which is now at depth pressure) from escaping as the diver ascends. The eardrum then bursts outwards, causing the same hazards as with an ordinary burst eardrum, such as <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> the middle ear deranging the working of the sense organs of balance in the inner ear.|$|E

M. 107b). He traced many diseases to lack of cleanliness (Shab. 133b), and others to disturbances of the regular mode of living (B. B. 146a). He claimed to possess cures for most diseases (B. M. 113b), and was especially skilful in treating the eye (B.
