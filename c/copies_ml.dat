40|$|A highly {{sensitive}} and rapid assay {{has been developed}} to quantify hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer principle and real-time PCR, using the LightCycler {{and a pair of}} specific fluorescent hybridization probes. This LightCycler real-time PCR assay (LC-PCR) detected HBV DNA in a linear range from 10 1 to 10 8 copies per reaction (250 - 2. 5 × 10 9 <b>copies</b> <b>ml</b> - 1), with a rapid PCR cycling time of 35 min. The assay was validated with two EUROHEP HBV DNA standards (ad and ay subtypes) and exhibited low intra-assay (< 6 %) and inter-assay (< 16 %) variation for both subtypes over the complete range of 7 orders of magnitude. The assay was evaluated clinically using serum samples from 120 HBsAg + individuals and 45 healthy controls who were negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBc. Levels of HBV DNA were measured in these samples using both the LC-PCR and Digene Hybrid Capture II HBV DNA (HCII) assays. The prevalence rates for HBV DNA in the HBsAg + serum samples were respectively 95 % (114 / 120) and 56 % (67 / 120) by LC-PCR and HCII (P < 0. 01). All 67 HCII-positive samples tested positive with LC-PCR, while the 47 discordant samples showed low levels of HBV DNA (down to 265 <b>copies</b> <b>ml</b> - 1), detectable only by the more sensitive LC-PCR assay. Levels of HBV DNA as measured by the two assays showed good correlation (r = 0. 902; P < 0. 001). The level of HBV DNA was significantly higher in HBeAg + than anti-HBe + samples (median 1. 5 × 10 7 vs 4. 6 × 10 4 <b>copies</b> <b>ml</b> - 1; P < 0. 01). It is concluded that this LC-PCR assay is clinically useful for the rapid, sensitive and accurate measurement of HBV DNA. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUntil recently, ammonia oxidation, a {{key process}} in the global {{nitrogen}} cycle, {{was thought to be}} mediated exclusively by a few bacterial groups. It has been shown now, that also Crenarchaeota are capable to perform this initial nitrification step. The abundance of ammonia oxidizing Bacteria and Archaea was determined using the bacterial and archaeal ammonia monooxygenase-a subunit (amoA) gene as functional markers in a quantitative PCR approach and related to the abundance of Bacteria and Archaea in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Archaeal amoA copy numbers decreased from 4000 – 5000 <b>copies</b> <b>ml</b> À 1 seawater from the 200 – 500 m depth layer to 20 <b>copies</b> <b>ml</b> À 1 at 1000 m depth. b-Proteobacterial amoA genes were below the detection limit in all the samples. The archaeal amoA copy numbers were correlated with NO 2 À concentrations, suggesting that ammonia-oxidizing Archaea may {{play a significant role in}} the nitrification in the mesopelagic waters of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. In the bathypelagic waters, however, archaeal amoA gene abundance was rather low although Crenarchaeota were abundant, indicating that Crenarchaeota might largely lack the amoA gene in these deep waters. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the archaeal community revealed a distinct clustering with the mesopelagic community distinctly different from the archaeal communities of both, the surface waters and the 3000 – 4000 m layers. Hence, the archaeal community in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea appears to be highly stratified despite the absence of major temperature and density gradients between the meso-and bathypelagic waters of the Mediterranean Sea...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the effect of HIV infection and of antiretroviral therapy on lipid metabolism in order to help the clinicians to improve the management of HIV-infected patients. The lipid profile of 700 subjects of which 272 HIV-negative persons and 428 HIV-infected, treatment-Naïve patients were evaluated. Blood was collected from the participants when they came for specialised consultation in the University Teaching Hospital of Yaoundé. Biometric (body mass index, waist and hip circumference) and clinical (opportunistic infections) parameters were determined for each subject enrolled for the study. The 428 patients were put on 4 different antiretroviral (ARV) drugs as follows: 201 patients on triple association Nevirapine (NVP) /Stavudine (d 4 T) /Lamivudine (3 TC), 177 on tritherapy Efavirenz (EFV) /Stavudine/Lamivudine, 34 on combination Lamivudine/Zidovudine (AZT) /Efavirenz and 16 on association Zidovudine/Lamivudine/Névirapine. The bodily changes of patients were measured during a period of two years of follow up. The overall prevalence of lipodystrophy increased significantly with the Lamivudine/Stavudine/Efavirenz ARV regimen, with breast lipodystrophy being the most frequent (15. 92 %; p = 0. 038). In general, the lipodystrophy was more prevalent in: (1) HIV-infected, treatment-Naïve patients with a CD 4 count less than 200 cells mm - 3 and a Viral Load (VL) more than 10000 <b>copies</b> <b>mL</b> - 1 and (2) female patients above 31 years old on ARV with CD 4 count more than 350 cells μL and viral load less than 50 <b>copies</b> <b>mL</b> - 1. The waist and hip circumference of patients on ARV therapy were significantly higher than those of HIV-infected, treatment-Naïve patients, irrespective of treatment regimen. There seems to be a high risk of developing lipodystrophy by HIV-infected patients during ARV therapy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Children with HIV {{will be on}} {{antiretroviral}} therapy (ART) {{longer than}} adults, and therefore the durability of first-line ART and timing of switch to second-line are key questions. We assess the long-term outcome of protease inhibitor and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) first-line ART and viral load switch criteria in children. METHODS: In a randomised open-label factorial trial, we compared effectiveness of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus a protease inhibitor versus two NRTIs plus an NNRTI and of switch to second-line ART at a viral load of 1000 <b>copies</b> per <b>mL</b> versus 30, 000 <b>copies</b> per <b>mL</b> in previously untreated children infected with HIV from Europe and North and South America. Random assignment was by computer-generated sequentially numbered lists stratified by age, region, and by exposure to perinatal ART. Primary outcome was change in viral load between baseline and 4 years. Analysis was by intention to treat, which we defined as all patients that started treatment. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN 73318385. FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2002, and Sept 7, 2005, 266 children (median age 6. 5 years; IQR 2. 8 - 12. 9) were randomly assigned treatment regimens: 66 to receive protease inhibitor and switch to second-line at 1000 <b>copies</b> per <b>mL</b> (PI-low), 65 protease inhibitor and switch at 30, 000 <b>copies</b> per <b>mL</b> (PI-higher), 68 NNRTI and switch at 1000 <b>copies</b> per <b>mL</b> (NNRTI-low), and 67 NNRTI and switch at 30, 000 <b>copies</b> per <b>mL</b> (NNRTI-higher). Median follow-up was 5. 0 years (IQR 4. 2 - 6. 0) and 188 (71 %) children were on first-line ART at trial end. At 4 years, mean reductions in viral load were - 3. 16 log(10) <b>copies</b> per <b>mL</b> for protease inhibitors versus - 3. 31 log(10) <b>copies</b> per <b>mL</b> for NNRTIs (difference - 0. 15 log(10) <b>copies</b> per <b>mL,</b> 95 % CI - 0. 41 to 0. 11; p= 0. 26), and - 3. 26 log(10) <b>copies</b> per <b>mL</b> for switching at the low versus - 3. 20 log(10) <b>copies</b> per <b>mL</b> for switching at the higher threshold (difference 0. 06 log(10) <b>copies</b> per <b>mL,</b> 95 % CI - 0. 20 to 0. 32; p= 0. 56). Protease inhibitor resistance was uncommon {{and there was no}} increase in NRTI resistance in the PI-higher compared with the PI-low group. NNRTI resistance was selected early, and about 10 % more children accumulated NRTI mutations in the NNRTI-higher than the NNRTI-low group. Nine children had new CDC stage-C events and 60 had grade 3 / 4 adverse events; both were balanced across randomised groups. INTERPRETATION: Good long-term outcomes were achieved with all treatments strategies. Delayed switching of protease-inhibitor-based ART might be reasonable where future drug options are limited, because the risk of selecting for NRTI and protease-inhibitor resistance is low.

40|$|A TaqMan-based {{real-time}} PCR assay {{was developed}} for the diagnosis of Anaplasma marginale infection of cattle. The established assay was proven to be highly specific, since no cross-reactions were observed with other Anaplasma species of ruminants, including the closely related Anaplasma centrale, or other haemoparasites of ruminants (Anaplasma bovis, Anaplasma ovis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia bovis, Babesia bigemina, Theileria annulata and Theileria buffeli).

Data analysis was based on statistical frameworks controlling the false-discovery rate. Atlas array data were considered relevant if they could be verified by U 133 A array or real-time RT-PCR. According to these criteria, there was no evidence for true changes in gene expression. Considering the precision of the U 133 A array and the number of replicates tested, potential expression changes due to Lassa virus infection are probably smaller than twofold. To substantiate the array data, beta interferon (IFN-b) gene expression was studied longitudinally in Lassa virus-infected HuH- 7 and FRhK- 4 cells by using real-time RT-PCR. IFN-b mRNA levels increased only twofold upon Lassa virus infection, although {{there was no evidence that}} the virus inhibited poly(I: C) -induced IFN-b gene expression.

The patients included 20 patients with IM, 2 patients with fatal IM, 4 patients with EBVAHS, 4 patients with CAEBV, and 38 healthy children (20 EBV seropositive and 18 EBV seronegative). In patients with IM, plasma samples were positive for EBV DNA in all patients (100 %) in the acute phase and in 44 % of the patients in the convalescent phase, but plasma samples from the 38 healthy control children were negative (0 %) for EBV DNA. Quantitative PCR assay revealed that plasma from patients with IM contained the highest amount of virus DNA within 7 days following the onset of disease (mean, 6 x 10 (4) <b>copies</b> per <b>ml).</b> The EBV DNA concentration decreased thereafter as the patients recovered.

From 30 October 2002 to 20 November 2003, 132 HIV 1 -positive patients taking Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) for more than one year in Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou were included. T-CD 4 + lymphocytes count was done using Dynabeads technique while genotypic test and ARV-resistance tests were conducted using Pol sequencing that codes for reverse transcriptase reverse, integrase and protease. Due to undetectable viremia, 86 samples out of 132 could not be characterized.

Direct sequencing of PCR products revealed 62 %mixed chromatograms predominantly belonging to Gram-positive bacteria. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) results of a sample subset confirmed sequence data showing polymicrobial DNA contents in 67 % of bactDNA-positive ascites samples. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the most severe bac-terial infection in patients with decompensated liver disease (1). As evidenced by culture-based diagnosis, Gram-negative bac-teria of the genera Escherichia andKlebsiella are the most frequent cause for SBP (2, 3). However, recent data reveal that also Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species may be responsible for bacterial peritonitis, especially in hospital-ized patients (4, 5). Since detection rates of classical culture tech-niques are low in the routine setting, the causative agent remains unknown in many cases of SBP (3). Application of culture-independent PCR-based methods for the detection of bacterial DNA (bactDNA) in ascites has been proposed as a suitable tool to improve pathogen identification in patients at risk for SBP (6) and has indicated that bactDNAderives inmost cases from a single pathogen (7 – 9).

40|$|Studies {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) vaccines in animal models {{suggest that it is}} difficult to induce complete protection from infection (sterilizing immunity) but that it is possible to reduce the viral load and to slow or prevent disease progression following infection. We have developed an age-structured epidemiological model of the effects of a disease-modifying HIV vaccine that incorporates the intrahost dynamics of infection, a transmission rate and host mortality that depend on the viral load, the possible evolution and transmission of vaccine escape mutant viruses, a finite duration of vaccine protection, and possible changes in sexual behavior. Using this model, we investigated the long-term outcome of a disease-modifying vaccine and utilized uncertainty analysis to quantify the effects of our lack of precise knowledge of various parameters. Our results suggest that the extent of viral load reduction in vaccinated infected individuals (compared to unvaccinated individuals) is the key predictor of vaccine efficacy. Reductions in viral load of about 1 log 10 <b>copies</b> <b>ml</b> � 1 would be sufficient to significantly reduce HIV-associated mortality in the first 20 years after the introduction of vaccination.

The 90 % confidence limits for the geometric mean ratio of the indinavir AUC(0, 12 h) and C max during the second trimester and post-partum (ante:post ratios) were 0. 58 (0. 49, 0. 68) and 0. 73 (0. 59, 0. 91), respectively; third trimester/post-partum AUC(0, 12 h) and C max ratios were 0. 60 (0. 53, 0. 68) and 0. 63 (0. 55, 0. 72), respectively. IDV/r was well tolerated and 21 / 26 women had a HIV- 1 viral load < 40 <b>copies</b> <b>ml</b> - 1 at delivery. All 26 infants were confirmed HIV negative. Conclusion: Indinavir exposure during the second and third trimesters was significantly reduced compared with post-partum and ∼ 30 % of women failed to achieve a target trough concentration. Increasing the dose of IDV/r during pregnancy to 600 / 100 mg twice daily may be preferable to ensure adequate drug concentrations. © 2013 The Authors...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Treatment {{strategies}} for patients in whom HIV replication is not suppressed after exposure to several drug classes remain unclear. We aimed {{to assess the}} inter-relations between viral load, CD 4 -cell count, and clinical outcome in patients who had experienced three-class virological failure. METHODS: We undertook collaborative joint analysis of 13 HIV cohorts from Europe, North America, and Australia, involving patients who had had three-class virological failure (viral load > 1000 <b>copies</b> per <b>mL</b> for > 4 months). Regression analyses were used to quantify the associations between CD 4 -cell-count slope, HIV- 1 RNA concentration, treatment information, and demographic characteristics. Predictors of death were analysed by Cox's proportional-hazards models. FINDINGS: 2488 patients were included. 2118 (85 %) had started antiretroviral therapy with single or dual therapy. During 5015 person-years of follow-up, 276 patients died (mortality rate 5. 5 per 100 person-years; 3 -year mortality risk 15. 3 % (95 % CI 13. 5 - 17. 3). Risk of death was strongly influenced by the latest CD 4 -cell count with a relative hazard of 15. 8 (95 % CI 9. 28 - 27. 0) for counts below 50 cells per microL versus above 200 cells per microL. The latest viral load did not independently predict death. For any given viral load, patients on treatment had more favourable CD 4 -cell-count slopes than those off treatment. For patients on treatment and with stable viral load, CD 4 -cell counts tended to be increasing at times when the current viral load was below 10000 <b>copies</b> per <b>mL</b> or 1. 5 log 10 <b>copies</b> per <b>mL</b> below off-treatment values. INTERPRETATION: In patients for whom viral-load suppression to {{below the level of}} detection is not possible, achievement and maintenance of a CD 4 -cell count above 200 per microL becomes the primary aim. Treatment regimens that maintain the viral load below 10000 <b>copies</b> per <b>mL</b> or at least provide 1. 5 log 10 <b>copies</b> per <b>mL</b> suppression below the off-treatment value {{do not seem to be}} associated with appreciable CD 4 -cell-count decline...|$|R

Following a log transformation analysis, the mean CMV DNA in plasma (PL), whole blood (WB), peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using the LightCycler was 6. 79 <b>copies</b> per <b>ml,</b> 7. 23 <b>copies</b> per <b>ml,</b> 6. 38 <b>copies</b> per 2 × 106 cells, and 6. 27 copies per 2 × 106 cells, respectively.

The boars were randomly divided into six groups. Vaccinated boars shed the North American PRRSV at the rate of 100. 1 to 101. 0 viral genome <b>copies</b> per <b>ml</b> and 3. 63 to 101. 1 50 % tissue culture infective doses (TCID 50) /ml, respectively, in semen, whereas nonvaccinated boars shed the North American PRRSV at the rate of 100. 2 to 104. 7 viral genome <b>copies</b> per <b>ml</b> and 1. 14 to 103. 07 TCID 50 /ml, respectively, in semen. Vaccinated boars shed the European PRRSV at the rate of 100. 1 to 104. 57 viral genome <b>copies</b> per <b>ml</b> and 1. 66 to 103. 10 TCID 50 /ml, respectively, in semen, whereas nonvaccinated boars shed the European PRRSV at the rate of 100. 3 to 105. 14 viral genome <b>copies</b> per <b>ml</b> and 1. 69 to 103. 17 TCID 50 /ml, respectively, in semen. The number of genomic copies of the European PRRSV in semen samples was not significantly different between vaccinated and nonvaccinated challenged European PRRSV boars.

40|$|Recombinant {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) -like particles (HCV-LPs) containing HCV structural proteins (core, E 1, and E 2) {{produced in}} insect cells resemble the putative HCV virions and {{are capable of}} inducing strong and broad humoral and cellular immune responses in mice and baboons. Here, we present evidence on the immunogenicity and induction of protective immunity by HCV-LPs in chimpanzees. Chimpanzees (two in each group), were immunized with HCV-LPs or HCV-LPs plus AS 01 B adjuvant. After immunizations, all animals developed an HCV-specific immune response including IFN-γ+, IL- 2 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + T cell and proliferative lymphocyte responses against core, E 1, and E 2. Upon challenge with an infectious HCV inoculum, one chimpanzee developed transient viremia with low HCV RNA titers (103 to 104 <b>copies</b> per <b>ml)</b> {{in the third and}} fourth weeks after the challenge. The three other chimpanzees became infected with higher levels of viremia (104 to 105 <b>copies</b> per <b>ml),</b> but their viral levels became unquantifiable (< 103 <b>copies</b> per <b>ml)</b> 10 weeks after the challenge. After the HCV challenge, all four chimpanzees demonstrated a significant increase in peripheral and intrahepatic T cell and proliferative responses against the HCV structural proteins. These T cell responses coincided with the fall in HCV RNA levels. Four naïve chimpanzees were infected with the same HCV inoculum, and three developed persistent infection with higher viremia in the range of 105 to 106 <b>copies</b> per <b>ml.</b> Our study suggests that HCV-LP immunization induces HCV-specific cellular immune responses that can control HCV challenge in the chimpanzee model...|$|R
40|$|Virus-specific T-helper {{cells are}} {{considered}} {{critical for the}} control of chronic viral infections. Successful treatment of acute HIV- 1 infection leads to augmentation of these responses, but whether this enhances immune control has not been determined. We administered one or two supervised treatment interruptions to eight subjects with treated acute infection, with the plan to restart therapy if viral load exceeded 5, 000 copies of HIV- 1 RNA per millilitre of plasma (the level at which therapy has been typically recommended) for three consecutive weeks, or 50, 000 RNA <b>copies</b> per <b>ml</b> at one time. Here we show that, despite rebound in viraemia, all subjects were able to achieve at least a transient steady state off therapy with viral load below 5, 000 RNA <b>copies</b> per <b>ml.</b> At present, five out of eight subjects remain off therapy with viral loads of less than 500 RNA <b>copies</b> per <b>ml</b> plasma after a median 6. 5 months (range 5 - 8. 7 months).

40|$|Quantitation {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA in the plasma of seropositive individuals was performed by using an external control assay with techniques to standardize and control each measurement. Rigorous study of the variability of the assay showed that the median intraassay reproducibility was log 10 0. 15 RNA <b>copies</b> per <b>ml</b> of plasma, while the median interassay reproducibility on replicate plasma samples was log 10 0. 25 copies perml. Specimen stability studies showed reproducible recovery of RNA from plasma stored at - 70 degrees C for up to 12 months. In clinically stable patients who were either untreated or taking zidovudine, the average week-to-week variation in plasma RNA levels, measured in real time, was log 10 0. 30 RNA <b>copies</b> per <b>ml.</b> In contrast, patients either initiating or changing antiretroviral therapy showed a fall of log 10 0. 8 to log 10 2. 0 <b>copies</b> per <b>ml</b> in plasma RNA levels.

This 96 -week follow-up of the trial assesses the durability of efficacy and safety of this treatment over 96 weeks. Methods ENCORE 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial done at 38 clinical sites in 13 countries. HIV-infected adult patients (≥ 16 years of age) with no previous antiretroviral therapy, a CD 4 cell count of 50 – 500 cells per μL, and plasma HIV- 1 viral load of at least 1000 <b>copies</b> per <b>mL</b> were randomly assigned (1 : 1) by an electronic case report form to receive fixed-dose daily tenofovir 300 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg plus efavirenz either 400 mg daily or 600 mg daily.

40|$|To prevent mother-to-child human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) transmission, {{it is important to}} identify its determinants. Because HIV- 1 RNA levels can be reduced by antiviral therapy, we examined the role of maternal plasma HIV- 1 RNA level in mother-to-child transmission. We used quantitative competitive PCR to measure HIV-RNA in 30 infected pregnant women and then followed their infants prospectively; 27 % of the women transmitted HIV- 1 to their infants and maternal plasma HIV- 1 RNA level correlated strikingly with transmission. Eight of the 10 women with the highest HIV- 1 RNA levels at delivery (190, 400 - 1, 664, 100 <b>copies</b> per <b>ml</b> of plasma) transmitted, while none of the 20 women with lower levels (500 - 155, 800 <b>copies</b> per <b>ml)</b> did (P = 0. 0002).

Examination of serial HIV- 1 RNA levels during pregnancy showed that viral load was stable in women who did not initiate or change antiviral therapy.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{knowledge}} {{has been building}} of the parasitic dinoflagellate group Marine Alveolate Group II (MALV II, within Syndiniales). While environmental cloning and sequencing approaches have indicated a high abundance of MALV II throughout the world’s oceans, relatively {{little is known about}} their seasonality and the significance of their role in the marine ecosystem. No studies to date have addressed either of these issues in Arctic waters. In this thesis, the relative abundance of MALV II rDNA was studied in Adventfjorden, Svalbard during spring 2012. Specific PCR primers were designed to the MALV II 18 S V 4 region and TaqMan PCR was used to quantify the relative abundances of MALV II 18 S rDNA. 18 S copy numbers rose from 400, 000 – 500, 000 <b>copies</b> / <b>mL</b> in February to a maximum of ~ 900, 000 <b>copies</b> / <b>mL</b> in April, before a sudden crash to below 100, 000 <b>copies</b> / <b>mL</b> after April 19 th from which the population did not recover. The oceanographic conditions within Adventfjorden over the season explained the MALV II abundance pattern. Atlantic water incurred into the fjord immediately prior to the study and was replaced with Arctic water around April 19 th. The MALV II populations detected in this study were probably transported into the fjord on the Atlantic currents. Attempts to determine a host species by comparing to phytoplankton and zooplankton abundances were unsuccessful.
