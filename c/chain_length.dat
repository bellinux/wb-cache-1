Within this short distance, the water concentration drops from 2M on the headgroup side to nearly zero on the tail (core) side.

Core thickness also varies significantly with temperature, in particular near a phase transition.|$|E

25|$|A common metric used to {{quantify}} food web trophic structure is food <b>chain</b> <b>length.</b> Food <b>chain</b> <b>length</b> {{is another way}} of describing food webs as a measure of the number of species encountered as energy or nutrients move from the plants to top predators. There are different ways of calculating food <b>chain</b> <b>length</b> depending on what parameters of the food web dynamic are being considered: connectance, energy, or interaction. In its simplest form, the length of a chain is the number of links between a trophic consumer and the base of the web. The mean <b>chain</b> <b>length</b> of an entire web is the arithmetic average of the lengths of all chains in a food web.|$|E

The longer <b>chain</b> <b>lengths,</b> n ≥ 20, show anomalous behavior compared to the shorter <b>chain</b> <b>lengths,</b> n < 20. This report concentrates on n = 24. Although the history and time dependence shows that equilibrium was not always achieved, it appears that there is a second gel-like phase G 2 below 40 °C. The G 2 phase has a small tilt angle and opposite hexagonal symmetry breaking from the usual G 1 gel phase. Also, as T is raised above 45 °C, the wide-angle data suggest the appearance of a phase with hexagonal chain packing and small chain tilt angle...|$|R

40|$|Properties of 1, 4 -trans poly (isoprene) at ambient {{conditions}} {{are determined by}} simulations on two length scales based on two different models: a full-atomistic and a mesoscopic one. The models are linked via a mapping scheme such that one mesoscopic bead represents one chemical repeat unit. Melts as well as solutions of several <b>chain</b> <b>lengths</b> were investigated and mapped individually to the meso-scale. The resulting models are compared to each other. The meso-scale models could be simulated over a large variety of <b>chain</b> <b>lengths</b> and time-scales relevant for experimental comparison. Concerning static properties, we determined the persistence length of our systems and the scaling behavior of the radius of gyration. The latter was compared to experiments and the agreement is satisfactory. Furthermore, we find deviations from Rouse dynamics at all <b>chain</b> <b>lengths</b> at {{ambient conditions}}.

25|$|Using the {{deactivation}} enhanced strategy, {{a relatively}} small instantaneous kinetic <b>chain</b> <b>length</b> limits the number of vinyl groups that {{can be added to}} a propagating chain end during each activation/deactivation cycles and thus keeps the polymer chains growing in a limited space. In this way, unlike what happens in free radical polymerization (FRP), the formation of huge polymer chains and large-scale combinations at early reaction stages is avoided. Therefore, a small instantaneous kinetic <b>chain</b> <b>length</b> is the prerequisite for further manipulation of intramolecular cyclization or intermolecular crosslinking. Based on the small instantaneous kinetic <b>chain</b> <b>length,</b> regulation of different chain dimensions and concentrations would lead to distinct reaction types. A low ratio of initiator to monomer would result in the formation of longer chains but of a lower chain concentration, This scenario would no doubt increases the chances of intramolecular cyclization due to the high local/spatial vinyl concentration within the growth boundary. Although the opportunity for intermolecular reactions can increase as the polymer chains grow, the likelihood of this occurring at the early stage of reactions is minimal due to the low chain concentration, which is why single chain cyclized/knotted polymers can form. However, in contrast, a high initiator concentration not only diminishes the chain dimension during the linear-growth phase thus suppressing the intramolecular cyclization, but it also increases the chain concentration within the system so that pendent vinyl groups in one chain are more likely to fall into the growth boundary of another chain. Once the monomers are converted to short chains, the intermolecular combination increases and allows the formation of hyperbranched structures with a high density of branching and vinyl functional groups.|$|E

25|$|The {{intrinsic}} viscosity of the material, found by extrapolating to zero concentration of relative viscosity to concentration which {{is measured in}} deciliters per gram (dℓ/g). Intrinsic viscosity is dependent upon the length of its polymer chains but has no units due to being extrapolated to zero concentration.
