25|$|The {{island has}} been {{designated}} as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its importance as {{a breeding ground for}} seabirds. In 1978–79 there were an estimated 117,000 breeding penguins on the island, consisting of macaroni penguin and, to a lesser extent, <b>chinstrap</b> <b>penguin</b> and Adélie penguin, although these were only estimated to be 62,000 in 1989–90. Nyrøysa is the most important colony for penguins, supplemented by Posadowskybreen, Kapp Circoncision, Norvegiaodden and across from Larsøya. Southern fulmar {{is by far the most}} common non-penguin bird with 100,000 individuals. Other breeding seabirds consist of Cape petrel, Antarctic prion, Wilson's storm petrel, black-bellied storm petrel, subantarctic skua, southern giant petrel, snow petrel, slender-billed prion and Antarctic tern. Kelp gull is thought to have bred on the island earlier. Non-breeding birds which can be found on the island include the king penguin, wandering albatross, black-browed albatross, Campbell albatross, Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross, sooty albatross, light-mantled albatross, northern giant petrel, Antarctic petrel, blue petrel, soft-plumaged petrel, Kerguelen petrel, white-headed petrel, fairy prion, white-chinned petrel, great shearwater, common diving petrel, south polar skua and parasitic jaeger.|$|E

40|$|Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and <b>chinstrap</b> <b>penguins</b> (P. antarctica) are morphologically and ecologically very similar, {{have very}} similar diet and breed sympatrically in the Scotia Arc from the South Sandwich Islands to the Antarctic Peninsula. To {{investigate}} how these two species co-exist, their foraging distribution and diet were studied during the chick-rearing period at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, during the breeding seasons of 2000 and 2001. Satellite tracking data from of 19 Adelie <b>penguins</b> and 24 <b>chinstrap</b> <b>penguins</b> {{were used to}} compare foraging distributions. In both years the diet of both species was exclusively Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) {{of the same size}} range. In a year of low prey availability (2000), there was a statistically significant segregation of foraging areas between the two species, however, in a year of normal resource availability (2001) there was no such segregation. There was {{a significant difference in the}} foraging areas used by Adelie penguins between years but not for <b>chinstrap</b> <b>penguins.</b> Adelie penguins foraged significantly farther (mean 100 km) from the colony than <b>chinstrap</b> <b>penguins</b> (mean 58 km) in 2000 but not in 2001 (mean 58 km and 35 km respectively). In 2000, the breeding success of Adelie penguins was 51 % lower than the long-term mean compared to 15 % lower in <b>chinstrap</b> <b>penguins.</b> Both species achieved above average breeding success in 2001. The changes in foraging distribution and breeding success suggest that in years of low resource availability, <b>chinstrap</b> <b>penguins</b> may be able to competitively exclude Adelie penguins from potential inshore foraging areas. Current trends in climatic change and possible effects on ice distribution and krill abundance suggest that conditions could become less favourable for Adelie <b>penguins</b> than <b>chinstrap</b> <b>penguins</b> in areas where both species occur...|$|R

Four of the seven blood parameters (glucose, urea, triglyceride and cholesterol) showed statistically significant variations between samples at periods of different light intensity. Blood chemistry changes in <b>chinstrap</b> <b>penguins</b> correspond with those expected in a diurnal bird under defined light-dark cycle. In the absence of eat-fast cycle, the daily cycle of light intensity, although greatly attenuated, is the most likely timekeeper (Zeitgeber) for circadian rhythms in blood parameters of <b>chinstrap</b> <b>penguins.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The koilin membrane, {{formed by}} the {{secretions}} of the ventricular and pyloric glands, functions as a protective layer in the gizzards of most bird species. However, the ecological functions of koilin have never been studied in free-ranging penguins. During the two austral summers from 2012 to 2014, we observed the regurgitated koilins of <b>chinstrap</b> <b>penguins</b> (Pygoscelis antarcticus) at Narębski Point on King George Island, South Shetland Islands, and we detected {{a significant difference in}} the daily accumulation of regurgitated koilins between the pre-hatching and post-hatching periods in the rookery. We also found 233 gastrointestinal parasites, all Stegophorus macronectes (Nematoda, Acuariidae), from 26 out of 45 koilins freshly regurgitated by <b>chinstrap</b> <b>penguins.</b> We suggest that the regurgitation of koilins may benefit adult <b>chinstrap</b> <b>penguins</b> in the wild by reducing parasitic loads when they fast during incubation; it may also help decrease the risk of parasite transmission to chicks. Our results present the first observations of regurgitated koilins among breeding <b>chinstrap</b> <b>penguins.</b> How koilin regurgitation functions in penguins requires further study. Among the gentoo penguins (P. papua) co-occurring at the study site, we observed no regurgitated koilin layers...|$|R

50|$|Penguin species {{found on}} the peninsula, {{especially}} near the tip and surrounding islands, include the <b>chinstrap</b> <b>penguin,</b> emperor penguin, gentoo penguin and the Adelie penguin. Petermann Island is the world's southernmost colony of gentoo penguins. The exposed rocks on the island {{is one of many}} locations on the peninsula that provides a good habitat for rookeries. The penguins return each year and may reach populations of more than ten thousand. Of these the most common on the Antarctic Peninsula are the chinstrap and gentoo, with the only breeding colony of emperor penguins in West Antarctica an isolated population on the Dion Islands, in Marguerite Bay on the west coast of the peninsula. Most emperor penguins breed in East Antarctica.|$|E
50|$|The harsh {{climate and}} ice-bound terrain limits {{vegetation}} to fungi (ascomycetes including lichens) and non-vascular plants (mosses and liverworts). The flora are {{representative for the}} maritime Antarctic and are phytogeographically similar to the South Sandwich Islands and South Shetland Islands. Vegetation is limited because of the ice cover, although snow algae are recorded. The remaining vegetation is located in snow-free areas such as nunatak ridges {{and other parts of}} the summit plateau, the coastal cliffs, capes and beaches. At Nyrøysa, five species of moss, six ascomycetes (including five lichens), and twenty algae have been recorded. Most snow-free areas are so steep and subject to frequent avalanches that only crustose lichens and algal formations are sustainable. There are six endemic ascomycetes, three of which are lichenized.The island has been designated as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its importance as a breeding ground for seabirds. In 1978-79 there were an estimated 117,000 breeding penguins on the island, consisting of macaroni penguin and, to a lesser extent, <b>chinstrap</b> <b>penguin</b> and Adélie penguin, although these were only estimated to be 62,000 in 1989-90.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} if the patterns of chick growth and mortality observed in two-chick broods of the <b>Chinstrap</b> <b>Penguin</b> (Pygoscelis antarctica) are affected by the feeding capacity of parents, we performed an experimental brood reduction at hatching by removing one sibling in some broods and comparing the growth and mortality patterns of these single chicks with those of control broods with two chicks. Chicks in reduced broods had longer flippers than those in control broods at 15, 21 and 47 days of age, and longer bills at 15, 21 and 32 days, but no differences in mass were found. Although more control than reduced broods suffered chick mortality, the productivity of control broods was markedly higher. Brood size has significant effects on final chick size in the <b>Chinstrap</b> <b>penguin.</b> Food limitation operated mainly {{at the end of the}} guard stage, although its effects were still significant during the crèche stage. Although the effect of brood size on growth may be more marked in last-hatched chicks, it can also be noted in first-hatched chicks. Growth may act as a fine-tuning mechanism to regulate productivity in this species, allowing parents to raise two chicks, but at the cost of slower growth and smaller final size. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Long-term {{monitoring}} of seabird numbers around Antarctica {{has revealed that}} the <b>chinstrap</b> <b>penguin</b> (Pygoscelis antarctica) is largely declining throughout its range in the Scotia Arc. Whether archipelagos across this large area remain connected via dispersal or represent genetically isolated groups {{has not yet been}} established. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the level of genetic differentiation between four breeding colonies on the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), South Shetland, South Orkney, and South Sandwich Islands using microsatellite-based analysis of population structure. All colonies had similar levels of genetic diversity (mean heterozygosity, H O = 0. 583) but colonies from the WAP and South Orkney Island had significant inbreeding coefficients. Hierarchical and pairwise F-statistics revealed very limited population structure in the Scotia Arc, with weak differentiation between colonies from the WAP, South Shetland and South Orkney Islands relative to the South Sandwich Islands, which are situated at least 1000 km apart from these other archipelagos. Bayesian model-based clustering methods found no evidence of significant population structuring, suggesting that whilst some isolation by distance may occur, there are no strong barriers to dispersal across this wide geographic range. No evidence of sex-biased dispersal was detected. We conclude that <b>chinstrap</b> <b>penguin</b> colonies across the Scotia Arc represent one interconnected breeding population. High levels of gene flow may be important in maintaining smaller, less stable colonies, and this status should be preserved by creating dispersal corridors throughout the Scotia Ar...|$|E
