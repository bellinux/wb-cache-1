25|$|HK has {{a history}} of {{innovation}} in firearms, {{such as the use of}} polymers in weapon designs and the use of an integral rail for flashlights on handguns. HK also developed modern polygonal rifling, noted for its high accuracy, increased muzzle velocity and barrel life. Not all of its technologically ambitious designs have translated into commercially successful products (for instance, the advanced but now abandoned G11 military rifle, which fired <b>caseless</b> high-velocity ammunition). In its extensive product range, HK has used the following operating systems for small arms: blowback operation, short-recoil, roller-delayed blowback, gas-delayed blowback, and gas operation (via Short-stroke piston).|$|E
25|$|The Ki-44-II Otsu (also {{known as}} the Ki-44-IIb) could be armed with a Ho-301 40mm autocannon. While this was a {{relatively}} high-caliber weapon, it used <b>caseless</b> ammunition with a low muzzle velocity and short range, which was effective only in close attacks. Some of these aircraft were used against USAAF bombers by a special Shinten Seiku Tai (air superiority unit), comprising at least four aircraft, {{that was part of}} 47th Sentai, based at Narimasu airfield in Tokyo. Pilots from such units attempted to shoot down B-29s and, once their ammunition was expended, to ram them – effectively a suicide attack. While the concept appeared straightforward, ramming a B-29 at high altitudes was difficult to achieve in practice.|$|E
25|$|Work on a {{successor}} for the venerable G3 rifle had been ongoing in Germany {{since the second}} half of the 1970s. These efforts resulted in the innovative 4.73mm G11 assault rifle (developed jointly by a group of companies led by H), that used <b>caseless</b> ammunition (designed by the Dynamit Nobel company). It had been predicted that this weapon would eventually replace the G3, therefore further development of H's series of firearms chambered for the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge had been halted. Heckler & Koch, having no incentive to pursue a new 5.56mm weapon system, was content with the export-oriented HK33 and G41 rifles. However, the G11 program came to an abrupt end when the Bundeswehr cancelled its procurement due to defence budget cuts after the unification of East and West Germany and H was acquired in 1991 by British Aerospace's Royal Ordnance division (known today as BAE Systems).|$|E
25|$|Serbian cuisine {{is largely}} heterogeneous, with heavy Oriental, Central European and Mediterranean influences. Despite this, it has evolved and {{achieved}} its own culinary identity. Food {{is very important}} in Serbian social life, particularly during religious holidays such as Christmas, Easter and feast days, i.e., slava. Staples of the Serbian diet include bread, meat, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Traditionally, three meals are consumed per day. Breakfast generally consists of eggs, meat and bread. Lunch is considered the main meal, and is normally eaten in the afternoon. Traditionally, Turkish coffee is prepared after a meal, and is served in small cups. Bread is the basis of all Serbian meals, and it {{plays an important role in}} Serbian cuisine and can be found in religious rituals. A traditional Serbian welcome is to offer bread and salt to guests, and also slatko (fruit preserve). Meat is widely consumed, as is fish. Serbian specialties include kajmak (a dairy product similar to clotted cream), proja (cornbread), kačamak (corn-flour porridge), and gibanica (cheese and kajmak pie). Ćevapčići, <b>caseless</b> grilled and seasoned sausages made of minced meat, is the national dish of Serbia.|$|E
2500|$|The LMG {{design is}} a {{traditionally}} laid-out machine-gun. It has several features conducive to its {{use as a}} light machine gun, such as a quick-change barrel, a vented fore-grip, a belt feeding mechanism, provisions {{for the use of}} an ammunition pouch, and a rate of fire of approximately 600 RPM. [...] Other features include its light weight, an ammunition counter, and a highly stiff and heat resistant barrel achieved with the use of fluting and specialized alloys. [...] When firing, the weapon's chamber swings around a longitudinal pivot; it swings from horizontally parallel with the pivot (the firing position) to vertically parallel (the feed position), and back again. [...] A long-stroke gas-piston is used to operate this action. [...] A round is fed into the chamber at the feed position using a rammer, and the new round also serves to push a spent or dud round out of {{the far end of the}} chamber. [...] Such rounds are pushed forward, parallel to the barrel, and they slide into a separate mechanism that ejects them out of one side of the gun. [...] The advantages of this whole action include its simplicity, its isolation of the chamber from barrel heat, and its positive control of round movement from extraction to ejection. [...] In the <b>caseless</b> firing version of the weapon, another mechanism is introduced to seal the chamber during firing, accounting for the slightly increased weight of the <b>caseless</b> version.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Vietnam War ended, the Soviet Union {{introduced}} a 40-mm grenade launcher that used the High-Low Principle, {{but with a}} twist on the original design. [...] The GP-25 40-mm grenade launcher fits under the assault rifle and fires a <b>caseless</b> projectile that is muzzle-loaded. [...] Instead of having a case, the high-pressure chamber {{is located on the}} rear of the projectile with ten vent holes, in which the launcher barrel acts as the low-pressure chamber. [...] The ignition of the propellant gases also causes the drive band to engage the launcher grooves, similar to the American Civil War Parrott muzzle loading rifled cannon.|$|E
2500|$|The Eagle's initial {{versions}} {{were the}} F-15 single-seat variant and TF-15 twin-seat variant. (After the F-15C was first flown, the designations were changed to [...] "F-15A" [...] and [...] "F-15B"). These versions would be powered by new Pratt & Whitney F100 engines {{to achieve a}} combat thrust-to-weight ratio in excess of 1:1. A proposed 25mm Ford-Philco GAU-7 cannon with <b>caseless</b> ammunition suffered development problems. It was dropped {{in favor of the}} standard M61 Vulcan gun. The F-15 used conformal carriage of four Sparrow missiles like the Phantom. The fixed wing was put onto a flat, wide fuselage that also provided an effective lifting surface. The first F-15A flight was made on 27 July 1972, with the first flight of the two-seat F-15B following in July 1973.|$|E
2500|$|The {{designers}} project further improvements. [...] These include improved projectile {{technologies such}} as environmentally friendly bullets and a change in bullet size {{in order to increase}} combat effectiveness, as well as the integration of electronics such as ammunition count readouts, lasers, optical sights, rangefinders, and bullet drop compensation. The Army is pursuing cased telescoped ammunition. [...] This development is far along, and they say a new LMG could be fielded within two years (2014) with unequivocal support. [...] The Marine Corps is pursuing <b>caseless</b> ammunition, which is less developed and will take several more years to refine. A compact version is also being developed with a 4-inch shorter barrel and folding, telescoping buttstock. The 5.56mm LSAT machine gun has been renamed the Cased Telescoped Light Machine Gun (CT LMG).|$|E
2500|$|The LMGs built made a 44% and 43% {{reduction}} of weight (for the cased telescoped and the <b>caseless</b> weapons, respectively). [...] Secondary goals {{have also been}} met: the LMG {{has the potential to}} improve battlefield effectiveness (due to its simpler and more consistent weapon action, its light weight and low recoil, and its stiffer barrel); its use of recoil compensation (with a long-stroke gas-system, for example) has produced positive feedback regarding controllability; the simpler mechanism of the LMG is both more reliable and easier to maintain; a rounds counter has been integrated to improve maintainability, and the weapon is capable of accepting other electronic devices; improved materials used in the chamber and barrel have reduced heat load on the weapon; and the weapon cost is equivalent to the existing M249. [...] The standard LSAT machine gun weighs 9.4lb empty, compared to 17.6lb for a standard SAW. [...] Cased telescoped ammunition weighs 40% less than brass-cased ammo, so a 100-round ammunition belt weighs about 2lb for the LSAT, compared to 3.3lb for a brass-cased belt.|$|E
2500|$|The LSAT {{light machine}} gun, of the LSAT (Lightweight Small Arms Technologies) program, is a developmental, {{powerful}} {{light machine gun}} (LMG). The purpose {{of the program was}} to develop a lighter, yet very reliable LMG. [...] The program was initiated in 2004, when the Joint Service Small Arms Program (JSSAP) challenged the American defence industry to develop a lighter small arms and also design lighter ammunition. [...] The LMG provides a major reduction in weight over legacy weapons, as well as improvements in other areas, such as controllability and reliability. As of 2008, it had two configurations, one that fires cased telescoped ammunition, and one that fires <b>caseless</b> ammunition. [...] After further research and development into both technologies and the guns that fire them, one of the two variants was to be chosen for production. By May 2015, 85,000 cased-telescoped rounds had been fired through 10 test weapons, with testers claiming the weapon had gone as far as it can go until the Army decides if it wants to make it a program of record.|$|E
2500|$|Development {{began with}} {{the two types of}} weight-reducing ammunition, and a light machine gun to serve as a testbed and {{technology}} demonstrator. [...] Use of an LMG for this purpose is notable, considering its greater technical complexity than infantry rifles. [...] The use of advanced computer simulations to accelerate development may have mitigated this, and the [...] [...] For development, the use of extensive computer simulation and modelling reduces both time and expenditure for prototyping and testing. The program also uses a 'spiral development' approach, whereby the weapon and ammunition is rolled out in stages or 'spirals', each stage producing a new version that is an improvement on those from previous spirals. A competition down-selected the design concepts of various companies to leave an AAI Corporation-led team of companies as the developers of the weapon system. The cohesive team of companies is combined with government support to ensure success. [...] The parallel development of the two ammunition types meant that, if the <b>caseless</b> ammunition effort succeeded, much of the development work gained with the composite cased weapon could be applied to it, and, if it failed, the composite-cased version was likely to succeed on its own.|$|E
2500|$|Due to Halo being a first-person shooter, {{significant}} {{emphasis was}} put into the design of human weaponry. The chief designer for human weapons was Robt McLees, {{who at the time}} of Combat Evolveds development was the only staff member at Bungie with knowledge of firearms; McLees {{wanted to make sure that}} the weapons looked [...] "cool", but were also grounded by real-world physics and considerations. The game designers also [...] wanted items that would be recognizable to players, yet futuristic-looking enough to plausibly exist in Halos 2552. In an interview, McLees noted that after human weapons had been vetted and the rough design worked out, [...] "I went ahead and built the highest-res LOD (level of detail) – and this is where I get [...] "bogged down" [...] with all of the stuff that [...] "nobody cares about" [...] like correct barrel diameter, placement of safeties, sights, magazine release buttons, and making sure that the magazines are actually large enough to hold all the bullets they're supposed to, that they would feed correctly and that the casings eject out of the correct side of the gun." [...] Occasionally, technical restraints forced design changes; the submachine gun introduced in Halo 2 originally featured a transparent magazine which allowed players to see the <b>caseless</b> ammo feed into the gun, but it proved too ambitious given the time and hardware available.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Caseless</b> rounds {{are limited}} {{by the fact that}} the {{cartridge}} body is primarily a propellant, and structural properties are secondary to the combustion properties. The primary issue is one of extraction. While <b>caseless</b> ammunition eliminates the need to extract a fired case, unfired <b>caseless</b> rounds must be extractable to unload the firearm or to clear a misfire. With metallic cases, this ability is provided by a rim or extractor groove machined into the rear of the case. Even in completely plastic bodied cartridges, such as the Activ brand shotgun shells, a thin metal ring is molded into the rim to provide support for the extractor. [...] A secondary issue is that ammunition in use can be exposed to air, water, lubricants, and solvents. Primer and propellant in <b>caseless</b> rounds is unprotected, while cartridge cases provide a high degree of protection.|$|E

5000|$|While {{there is}} at least one {{experimental}} military rifle (the H&K G11), and one commercial rifle (the Voere VEC-91), that use <b>caseless</b> rounds, they have met with little success. One other commercial rifle was the Daisy VL rifle made by the Daisy Air Rifle Co. and chambered for [...]22 caliber <b>caseless</b> ammunition that was ignited by a hot blast of compressed air from the lever used to compress a strong spring like for an air rifle. The <b>caseless</b> ammunition is of course not reloadable, since there is no casing left after firing the bullet, and the exposed propellant makes the rounds less durable. Also, the case in a standard cartridge serves as a seal, keeping gas from escaping the breech. <b>Caseless</b> arms must use a more complex self-sealing breech, which increases the design and manufacturing complexity. Another unpleasant problem, common to all rapid-firing arms but particularly problematic for those firing <b>caseless</b> rounds, is the problem of rounds [...] "cooking off". This problem is caused by [...] heat from the chamber heating the round in the chamber to the point where it ignites, causing an unintentional discharge.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the first}} <b>caseless</b> firearm and {{ammunition}} systems produced was made by Daisy, the airgun maker, in 1968. The Daisy V/L Rifle used a [...]22 caliber (5.5 mm) low-powered <b>caseless</b> round with no primer. The rifle was basically a spring-piston air rifle, but when used with the V/L ammunition the energy from the compression of the piston heated the air behind the <b>caseless</b> cartridge enough to ignite the propellant, and this generated {{the bulk of the}} energy of firing.

50|$|While {{it seems}} a simple {{operation}} to replace the case {{with a piece of}} solid propellant, the cartridge case provides more than just a way to keep the cartridge components together, and these other functions must be replaced if the case is to be replaced. <b>Caseless</b> ammunition is not without its drawbacks, and it is these drawbacks that have kept modern <b>caseless</b> ammunition from achieving wider success.|$|E
5000|$|A recent {{topic of}} {{research}} {{has been in the}} realm of [...] "caseless ammunition". In a <b>caseless</b> cartridge, the propellant is cast as a single solid grain, with the priming compound placed in a hollow at the base, and the bullet attached to the front. Since the single propellant grain is so large (most smokeless powders have grain sizes around 1 mm, but a <b>caseless</b> grain will be perhaps 7 mm diameter and 15 mm long), the relative burn rate must be much higher. To reach this rate of burning, <b>caseless</b> propellants often use moderated explosives, such as RDX. (<b>Caseless</b> ammunition might be considered a return to the mid-19th century, since the first practical cartridge repeater, the [...] "Volcanic" [...] pistol, used a charge of black powder in a cavity in the bullet base. This weapon was the direct ancestor of the Henry and Winchester rifles, though they switched to metal-cased ammunition. Some early rifles and revolvers also used combustible-paper cartridges, but they required a separate ignition system.) The major advantages of a successful <b>caseless</b> round would be elimination of the need to extract and eject the spent cartridge case, permitting higher rates of fire and a simpler mechanism, and also reduced ammunition weight by eliminating the weight (and cost) of the brass or steel case.|$|E
50|$|<b>Caseless</b> {{ammunition}} {{has been}} a popular military rifle concept {{since the end of}} World War II, but has never met with public approval due to its sole source nature (and it cannot be handloaded at home). The main benefits of <b>caseless</b> ammunition to the military are that ammunition can be made lighter, enabling soldiers to carry several hundred rounds, and the fact that case extraction is not required allows a faster automatic rate of fire, both of which are immaterial {{to the needs of the}} typical civilian shooter or hunter, who rarely wants to carry hundreds of rounds of ammunition, or is allowed to own an automatic firearm.
