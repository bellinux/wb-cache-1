5|$|In some of Messiaen's scores, he notated the colours in {{the music}} (notably in Couleurs de la cité céleste and Des canyons aux étoiles...)—the purpose being to aid the {{conductor}} in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's synaesthesia, which he said caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (he {{said that he did}} not perceive the colours visually). In his multi-volume music theory treatise Traité de rythme, de <b>couleur,</b> et d'ornithologie ("Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong"), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple ("gold and brown") to the highly detailed ("blue-violet rocks, speckled with little grey cubes, cobalt blue, deep Prussian blue, highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of mauve, black and white. Blue-violet is dominant").|$|E

25|$|A {{second was}} the free blacks (usually mixed-race, known as mulattoes or gens de <b>couleur</b> libres, free people of color). These gens de <b>couleur</b> {{tended to be}} educated and literate and they often served in the army or as administrators on plantations. Many were {{children}} of white planters and enslaved mothers while others had purchased their freedom from their owners through the sale of their own produce or artistic works. They often received education or artisan training, and sometimes inherited freedom or property from their fathers. Some gens de <b>couleur</b> even operated their own plantations and were slave owners.|$|E
25|$|As {{numbers of}} gens de <b>couleur</b> grew, the French rulers enacted discriminatory laws. Statutes forbade gens de <b>couleur</b> from taking up certain professions, marrying whites, wearing European clothing, {{carrying}} swords or firearms in public, or attending social functions where whites were present. However, these regulations did not restrict their purchase of land, and many accumulated substantial holdings and became slave-owners. By 1789, they owned {{one-third of the}} plantation property and one-quarter of the slaves of Saint-Domingue. Central {{to the rise of}} the gens de <b>couleur</b> planter class was the growing importance of coffee, which thrived on the marginal hillside plots to which they were often relegated. The largest concentration of gens de <b>couleur</b> was in the southern peninsula, the last region of the colony to be settled, owing to its distance from Atlantic shipping lanes and its formidable terrain, with the highest mountain range in the Caribbean.|$|E

25|$|In 1792, the French {{government}} sent three commissioners {{with troops}} to re-establish control. To build {{an alliance with}} the gens de <b>couleur</b> and slaves, the French commissioners Sonthonax and Polverel abolished slavery in the colony. Six months later, the National Convention, led by Robespierre and the Jacobins, endorsed abolition and extended it to all the French colonies.|$|E

They were formed {{according to the}} historic examples of the already existing fraternities, like wearing <b>couleur,</b> rules of behaviour, lifelong membership and democratic organization, but added as main principle the foundation upon the Catholic faith.|$|E

25|$|The slaves, {{along with}} free gens de <b>couleur</b> and allies, {{continued}} their fight for independence. Jean-Jacques Dessalines defeated French troops at the Battle of Vertières on 18 November 1803, leading {{the first ever}} successful slave army revolution. In late 1803, France withdrew its remaining 7,000 troops from the island and Napoleon gave up his idea of re-establishing a North American empire. With the war going badly, he sold Louisiana (New France) to the United States, in the Louisiana Purchase.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1821, President Jean-Pierre Boyer, also an homme de <b>couleur</b> and {{successor}} to Pétion, reunified {{the two parts}} of Haiti and extended control over the entire western portion of the island. In addition, after Santo Domingo declared its independence from Spain on 30 November 1821, Boyer sent forces in to take control. Boyer ruled the entire island with iron rule, ending slavery in Santo Domingo. After Santo Domingo achieved independence from Haiti, it established a separate national identity.|$|E
25|$|The Haitian Revolution {{had begun}} in 1791, when black slaves on the Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue rose up against their French owners amidst the French Revolution. Toussaint came to {{prominence}} {{as a leader of}} rebel slaves in the north of Saint-Domingue, operating in territories surrounding the port of Le Cap. Simultaneously, Rigaud emerged as a rebel leader among the mixed-race gens de <b>couleur,</b> or free people of color, in the south of Saint-Domingue, where they had a significant presence around the port of Les Cayes.|$|E

25|$|In {{presenting}} the war, historians often {{point to the}} ethnic divide between Saint-Domingue's black and mulatto populations. Rigaud, a free mulatto, is seen as being favored by the whites and other mulattos, {{who were part of}} the gens de <b>couleur.</b> In contrast, Toussaint was held in high regard by the colony's black population. Under Rigaud's regime, gens de colour had filled many officer posts in his army and acquired many abandoned plantation properties in the south. Meanwhile, most of the officers in Toussaint's army were of African ancestry.|$|E
25|$|Thousands of {{refugees}} from the 1804 Haitian Revolution, both whites and free people of color (affranchis or gens de <b>couleur</b> libres), arrived in New Orleans, often accompanied by slaves of African descent. While Governor Claiborne and other officials wanted to keep out additional free black people, the French Creoles wanted to increase the French-speaking population. As more refugees were allowed into the Territory of Orleans, Haitian émigrés who had first gone to Cuba also arrived. Many of the white Francophones had been deported by officials in Cuba in retaliation for Bonapartist schemes.|$|E

The fraternity teaches and expects tolerance from its members, stemming from diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds.|$|E
