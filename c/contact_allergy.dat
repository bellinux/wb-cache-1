25|$|Patch {{testing is}} a method used to {{determine}} if a specific substance causes allergic inflammation of the skin. It tests for delayed reactions. It is used to help ascertain the cause of skin <b>contact</b> <b>allergy,</b> or contact dermatitis. Adhesive patches, usually treated with a number of common allergic chemicals or skin sensitizers, are applied to the back. The skin is then examined for possible local reactions at least twice, usually at 48 hours after application of the patch, and again two or three days later.|$|E
25|$|Methylisothiazolinone is used {{commonly}} {{in products}} {{in conjunction with}} methylchloroisothiazolinone, a mixture sold under the registered trade name Kathon CG. A common indication of sensitivity to Kathon CG is allergic contact dermatitis. Sensitization to this family of preservatives was observed {{as early as the}} late 1980s. Due to increased use of isothiazolinone-based preservatives in recent years, an increase in reported incidences of <b>contact</b> <b>allergy</b> to this product has been reported. In 2013 the substance was declared the 2013 Contact Allergen of the Year by the American Contact Dermatitis Society. In 2016 the Dermatitis Academy launched a call to action for patients to report their isothiazolinone allergy to the FDA.|$|E

40|$|Background: Type I sensitizations and atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) often {{appear in the}} same patient. Beneficial effects of allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT) in patients with bothADand type I allergies have been reported. The predisposing role of AD {{to the development of}} type IV sensitization is discussed. Whether ASIT for type I allergy also influences type IV allergies is unknown. Objectives: To compare the number of <b>contact</b> <b>allergies</b> between patients with and without AD, before and after one year’s treatment with ASIT. Materials and Methods: A controlled, single-blind multicentre study of children/adults with allergic asthma and/or rhinoconjunctivitis, treated or untreated with ASIT, was performed. The history of AD was collected using questionnaires. The number of <b>contact</b> <b>allergies</b> was assessed by patch testing with a baseline series. Results: 205 individuals completed the study; 133 treated with ASIT (exposed) and 72 before starting ASIT (unexposed). For participants with AD, significantly more <b>contact</b> <b>allergies</b> were found in the groups of all children (p = 0. 002), all exposed children (p< 0. 001), and all exposed study persons (p = 0. 013). Independent of AD, significantly more <b>contact</b> <b>allergies</b> were noted in the groups of all unexposed adults (p = 0. 004) and all unexposed study persons (p = 0. 004). Conclusions: The higher number of <b>contact</b> <b>allergies</b> in patients with AD indicates that AD may be a risk factor for type IV sensitization in those with allergic asthma and/or rhinoconjunctivitis. The lower number of <b>contact</b> <b>allergies</b> in patients exposed to ASIT suggests an immunomodulatory effect on type IV sensitization...|$|R
500|$|Sensitized {{individuals}} may show a skin <b>contact</b> <b>allergy</b> to nickel {{known as a}} contact dermatitis. Highly sensitized {{individuals may}} also react to foods with high nickel content. Sensitivity to nickel may also be present in patients with pompholyx. Nickel is the top confirmed contact allergen worldwide, partly due to its use in jewelry for pierced ears. Nickel allergies affecting pierced ears are often marked by itchy, red skin. Many earrings are now made without nickel or low-release nickel to address this problem. The amount allowed in products that contact human skin is now regulated by the European Union. In 2002, researchers found that the nickel released by 1 and 2 Euro coins was far in excess of those standards. This {{is believed to be}} the result of a galvanic reaction. Nickel was voted Allergen of the Year in 2008 by the American Contact Dermatitis Society. In August 2015, the American Academy of Dermatology adopted a position statement on the safety of nickel: [...] "Estimates suggest that contact dermatitis, which includes nickel sensitization, accounts for approximately $1.918 billion and affects nearly 72.29 million people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thiomersal {{is used in}} patch {{testing for}} people who have dermatitis, conjunctivitis, and other {{potentially}} allergic reactions. A 2007 study in Norway found that 1.9% of adults had a positive patch test reaction to thiomersal; a higher prevalence of <b>contact</b> <b>allergy</b> (up to 6.6%) was observed in German populations. Thiomersal-sensitive individuals can receive intramuscular rather than subcutaneous immunization, though there have been no large sample sized studies regarding this matter to date. [...] In real-world practice on vaccination of adult populations, <b>contact</b> <b>allergy</b> does not seem to elicit clinical reaction. Thiomersal allergy has decreased in Denmark, probably because of its exclusion from vaccines there. In a recent study of Polish children and adolescents with chronic/recurrent eczema, positive reactions to thiomersal were found in 11.7% of children (7–8 y.o.) and 37.6% of adolescents (16–17 y.o.). This difference in the sensitization rates can be explained by changing exposure patterns: The adolescents have received six thiomersal-preserved vaccines during their life course, with the last immunization taking place 2–3 years before the mentioned study, younger children received only four thiomersal-preserved vaccines, with the last one applied 5 years before the study, while further immunizations were performed with new thiomersal-free vaccines.|$|E

The delay in re-evaluation of the safety of MI in cosmetic products is of concern to the SCCS; it has adversely affected consumer safety." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wheat allergy is {{an allergy}} which {{typically}} presents {{itself as a}} food allergy, but {{can also be a}} <b>contact</b> <b>allergy</b> resulting from occupational exposure to wheat. Like all allergies, wheat allergy involves immunoglobulin E and mast cell response. [...] Typically the allergy is limited to the seed storage proteins of wheat, some reactions are restricted to wheat proteins, while others can react across many varieties of seeds and other plant tissues. Wheat allergy may be a misnomer since there are many allergenic components in wheat, for example serine protease inhibitors, glutelins and prolamins and different responses are often attributed to different proteins. Twenty-seven potential wheat allergens have been successfully identified. The most severe response is exercise/aspirin induced anaphylaxis attributed to one omega gliadin that is a relative of the protein that causes celiac disease. Other more common symptoms include nausea, urticaria, atopy. Gluten sensitivity is not usually classified as a wheat allergy.|$|E

40|$|Background: In the Department of Occupational and Environmental Dermatology {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in the inflow of patients, working as surgical nurses or surgeons. They have been referred due to presumed occupational contact dermatitis. Results from investigated patients have in part been presented previously, where the investigation has shownmultiple <b>contact</b> <b>allergies</b> caused by their occupational use of gloves. Allergens such as diphenylguanidine were found in the gloves and <b>contact</b> <b>allergies</b> to their rubber gloves were found. Many of the patients have been working for decades in their present occupation, but the hand dermatitis had often been present for less than a year. Objectives: To present a follow-up of patientswith hand dermatitis due to gloves. Methods: A follow-up of the patients and a structure for the investigation of the individual patient are given. Results: The cases will be presented with their <b>contact</b> <b>allergies,</b> howtheinvestigation isperformedandtheoutcomeof theprevention by avoiding gloves containing the allergens diagnosed in the individual patients. Conclusions: For health care personnel hand hygiene and the wearing of protective gloves are mandatory. Our findings indicate that the increased need to use rubber gloves {{and at the same time}} the exclusion of latex gloves give rise to new <b>contact</b> <b>allergies</b> which are clinically relevant. In the investigation, and the advice given to the patients, several factors have to be taken into consideration, including the fast change of glove material. The cases indicate the importance of close cooperation between chemists and dermatologists and the possibility to perform chemical analysis. Furthermore, and just as important for this patient group, is that with correct diagnosis and advice the contact dermatitis can actually heal completely and the patients continue in their work...|$|R

40|$|Chronic {{eczematous}} hand dermatoses {{with and}} without <b>contact</b> <b>allergies</b> are complex diseases, {{which makes it a}} challenge to select the best treatment and obtain an optimal patient experience and a satisfactory treatment result. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate retrospectively the clinical effect and patient experience of local treatment with psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) soaks and TL 01 phototherapy for severe chronic hand dermatoses, and also to evaluate the quality of life for the subgroup of patients with allergic contact dermatitis including Compositae allergy. A retrospective evaluation of results for 94 consecutive patients having received a total of 121 treatment courses with local PUVA soaks or TL 01 phototherapy for one of the following diagnoses (n=number of treatment courses) : psoriasis (n= 19), hyperkeratotic hand eczema (n= 27), Pustulosis Palmoplantaris (PPP) (n= 22), vesicular eczema (n= 16), Compositae dermatitis (n= 24), and allergic contact dermatitis (n= 13). Moreover, semi-structured interviews with 6 selected patients having multiple <b>contact</b> <b>allergies</b> including Compositae allergy were used to evaluate quality of life.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the hypothesis that people who develop <b>contact</b> <b>allergies</b> to environmental substances {{do so because they}} have heightened susceptibility. Analysis of data from 2200 consecutive patients tested with the 20 commonest antigens in a patch-test clinic showed that more people developed multiple <b>contact</b> <b>allergies</b> than would be predicted from the frequency of single allergies; the excess was too great to be explained by chance and increased with number and rarity of the combinations of sensitizers. The possibility that this was due to enhanced individual susceptibility to sensitization rather than concomitant exposure to several sensitizers was confirmed by showing that patients with multiple allergies are more readily sensitized experimentally, and to a greater degree than normal, by dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), an unrelated antigen. The defect involves induction rather than expression of sensitivity. Amplification of the response to DNCB is proportional to susceptibility (calculated from the ratio of observed prevalence of multiple allergies to that predicted from the prevalence of single allergies) throughout the range from normal subjects, through those with a single sensitivity, to those with rare, multiple allergies. Therefore, we conclude that individual susceptibility {{is an important factor in}} the development of contact dermatitis, and occurs by a non-antigen-specific amplification of immune sensitization...|$|R

40|$|Background: Data on <b>contact</b> <b>allergies</b> in {{children}} are poor. This study aims {{to identify the}} occurrence of <b>contact</b> <b>allergies</b> and relevance of allergens {{in children}}. This will allow better identification of potential sensitizers and improve patients' care in children. Patients and methods: We retrospectively analyzed data of children aged 0 - 18 years, that were patchtested with at least the European base line series between 1996 - 2013 in 3 University Hospitals across the Netherlands. Patchtesting was performed using the TRUE-test (n= 322) and Trolab/Hermal/ Chemotechnique allergens (n= 690). Additional patch tests series were also analyzed. Preliminary results: 1012 Children (male 38 %, mean age 13 years) were included, of which 531 (52 %) developed ≥ 1 positive reaction. The most frequent reactions were found to nickel (16, 4 %: 164 / 998), cocamidopropylbetaine (15, 9 %: 54 / 339), Fragrancemix-I (9, 8 %: 99 / 1008), amerchol-L- 101 (8, 8 %: 30 / 339) and woolalcohols (6, 1 %: 62 / 1009). In children with atopic dermatitis (AD) the most common reaction was to cocamidopropylbetaine, although this difference was not significant compared to children without AD. Reactions to woolalcohols were significantly more common in children with AD (p= 0, 04).
