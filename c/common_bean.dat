25|$|The {{integration}} of plant cultivation in El Paraíso occurred slowly {{as there were}} plentiful sources of marine organisms. Due to the evidence of such high marine resources, agriculture mainly acted as an industrial resource. The earliest cultigens {{are found to be}} cotton (Gossypium barbadense) and bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) which date back to 2500B.C. Other cultigens include squash (Cucurbita ficifolia, C. maxima, and C. moschata), chili pepper (Capiscum sp), the <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> (P. vulgaris), achira (Canne edulis) and jicama (Pachyrrhizus tuberosus). There are remnants of guava, Lucuma and pacae which insist on a varied diet as well as management over some crops that were not cultivated. An abundance of Solanum spp., found within coprolite remains indicates there were plants ranging from night shades to potatoes most likely being domesticated as well. Cotton is one of the highest found crops at the site. It was important as an industrial crop to build nets and lines for catching fish and other marine resources. It also doubled as a resource manufactured into textiles to make clothing.|$|E
25|$|By roughly 6000 BC, hunter-gatherers {{living in}} the {{highlands}} and lowlands of Mesoamerica began to develop agricultural practices with early cultivation of squash and chilli. The earliest example of maize dates to c. 4000 BC and comes from Guilá Naquitz, a cave in Oaxaca. Earlier maize samples have been documented at the Los Ladrones cave site in Panama, c. 5500 BC. Slightly thereafter, other crops began to be cultivated by the semi-agrarian communities throughout Mesoamerica. Although maize {{is the most common}} domesticate, the <b>common</b> <b>bean,</b> tepary bean, scarlet runner bean, jicama, tomato and squash all became common cultivates by 3500 BC. At the same time, cotton, yucca and agave were exploited for fibers and textile materials. By 2000 BC, corn was the staple crop in the region and remained so through modern times. The Ramón or Breadnut tree (Brosimum alicastrum) was an occasional substitute for maize in producing flour. Fruit was also important in the daily diet of Mesoamerican cultures. Some of the main ones consumed include avocado, papaya, guava, mamey, zapote, and annona.|$|E

60|$|Many {{years ago}} I was struck {{with the fact}} that humble-bees as a general rule {{perforate}} flowers only when these grow in large numbers near together. In a garden where there were some very large beds of Stachys coccinea and of Pentstemon argutus, every single flower was perforated, but I found two plants of the former species growing quite separate with their petals much scratched, showing that they had been frequently visited by bees, and yet not a single flower was perforated. I found also a separate plant of the Pentstemon, and saw bees entering the mouth of the corolla, and not a single flower had been perforated. In the following year (1842) I visited the same garden several times: on the 19th of July humble-bees were sucking the flowers of Stachys coccinea and Salvia grahami in the proper manner, and none of the corollas were perforated. On the 7th of August all the flowers were perforated, even those on some few plants of the Salvia which grew at a little distance from the great bed. On the 21st of August only a few flowers on the summits of the spikes of both species remained fresh, and not one of these was now bored. Again, in my own garden every plant in several rows of the <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> had many flowers perforated; but I found three plants in separate parts of the garden which had sprung up accidentally, and these had not a single flower perforated. General Strachey formerly saw many perforated flowers in a garden in the Himalaya, and he wrote to the owner to inquire whether this relation between the plants growing crowded and their perforation by the bees there held good, and was answered in the affirmative. Hence it follows that the red clover (Trifolium pratense) and the <b>common</b> <b>bean</b> when cultivated in great masses in fields,--that Erica tetralix growing in large numbers on heaths,--rows of the scarlet kidney-bean in the kitchen-garden,--and masses of any species in the flower-garden,--are all eminently liable to be perforated.|$|E
60|$|With {{respect to}} the {{abortion}} of tendrils, certain cultivated varieties of Cucurbita pepo have, according to Naudin, {47} either quite lost these organs or bear semi-monstrous representatives of them. In my limited experience, I have met with only one apparent instance of their natural suppression, namely, in the <b>common</b> <b>bean.</b> All the other species of Vicia, I believe, bear tendrils; but the bean is stiff enough to support its own stem, and in this species, {{at the end of}} the petiole, where, according to analogy, a tendril ought to have existed, a small pointed filament projects, about a third of an inch in length, and which is probably the rudiment of a tendril. This may be the more safely inferred, as in young and unhealthy specimens of other tendril-bearing plants similar rudiments may occasionally be observed. In the bean these filaments are variable in shape, as is so frequently the case with rudimentary organs; they are either cylindrical, or foliaceous, or are deeply furrowed on the upper surface. They have not retained any vestige of the power of revolving. It is a curious fact, that many of these filaments, when foliaceous, have on their lower surfaces, dark-coloured glands like those on the stipules, which excrete a sweet fluid; so that these rudiments have been feebly utilized.|$|E

To test if cooking at high altitudes is less {{effective}} at inactivating TI than cooking at sea level, <b>common</b> <b>beans</b> and fava beans were cooked in water at temperatures chosen to simulate boiling points at different altitudes. In addition, each variety was autoclaved in water at 121 °C to simulate a pressure cooker. Trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA) was measured with N-α-Benzoyl-L-arginine 4 -nitroanilide hydrochloride, and in vitro protein digestibility was determined by digestion of samples with 3 peptidases. Raw common and raw fava beans inhibited 100 % and 36 % of trypsin activity, respectively. Cooking <b>common</b> <b>beans</b> at 100 °C inactivated 88. 6 % (SD± 4. 8) of TI, while cooking at temperatures between 87 - 97 °C inactivated 73. 2 % (p< 0. 05).
