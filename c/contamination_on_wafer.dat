Especially surface contamination is introduced in this process step because impurities from sawing meet with a virgin silicon surface which is highly reactive until the oxide layer is formed. In this paper we quantitatively analysed both, the organic and inorganic <b>contamination</b> <b>on</b> <b>wafer</b> surfaces and show that changes of process parameters during wafering may cause dramatic changes in surface purity.

40|$|The {{impact of}} organic <b>contamination</b> <b>on</b> <b>wafer</b> {{surfaces}} on the functionality of nanostructures and advanced microelectronics becomes crucial as the continuously shrinking feature sizes become {{similar to the}} dimensions of molecules and clusters of molecules. Especially, manufacturing of highly integrated circuits requires clean surfaces as processes might cause defects involving for example carbon and sulfur. The approach to study organic <b>contamination</b> <b>on</b> <b>wafer</b> samples using different analytical tools enables the detection of {{the whole range of}} organic compounds including non-volatile and volatile ones. For the studies the methods used were synchrotron radiation based Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) in the soft X-Ray range at the absorption edges of light elements (e. g. C, N, O, F) combined with reference-free Total-reflection X-Ray Fluorescence (TXRF) analysis, Thermal Desorption Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (TD-GCMS), and Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). TOF-SIMS analysis of the surfaces of wafers from the lithography process after ashing showed sulfur compounds related to resist residues not identified by TD-GCMS. The source of the sulfur is assumed to be a photo acid generator of the resist. It was proven by TD-GCMS and TXRF-NEXAFS that final clean and packaging were the process steps during which detectable organic contamination was transferred to the wafer surface during wafer manufacturing. Multi-criteria evaluation of the TXRF NEXAFS spectra was used to compare the results with TD-GCMS. The TXRF-NEXAFS results are in good agreement with the TD-GCMS results. The advantage of TXRF-NEXAFS and TOF-SIMS are the sensitivity for organic contaminants that are not detectable by TD-GCMS, due to their high boiling point and low vapor pressures...|$|E

In an attempt to improve the sensitivity of TXRF, this research investigates Synchrotron Radiation TXRF (SR TXRF).

40|$|Silicon wafers with thermal {{silicon oxide}} layers were cleaned and hydrophilized by three {{different}} methods: (1) the remote chemical analysis (RCA) wet cleaning {{by use of}} ammonia and hydrogen peroxide mixture solutions, (2) water-vapor plasma cleaning, and (3) UV/ozone combined cleaning. All procedures were found to remove effectively organic <b>contaminations</b> <b>on</b> <b>wafers</b> and gave identical characteristics of the contact angle, the surface roughness and the normal force interactions, measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). However, {{it is found that}} wafers cleaned by the RCA method have several times larger friction coefficients than those cleaned by the plasma and UV/ozone methods. The difference was explained by the atomic-scale topological difference induced during the RCA cleaning.

40|$|Chemical {{mechanical}} planarization (CMP) {{of metals}} {{is a critical}} process in the manufacturing of ultra-large scale integrated (ULSI) circuit devices. The overall success of a CMP process requires minimal particulate and metallic contamination of the structures subjected to CMP. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate alumina particle contamination during tungsten CMP, copper contamination in copper CMP, and galvanic corrosion between metal films and adhesion layers during the final stages of tungsten and copper CMP. Particular attention was paid to the use of short chain organic carboxylic acids in reducing the contamination. Both electrokinetic and uptake measurements showed that citric acid and malonic acid interact with alumina particles by electrostatic as well as specific adsorption forces. Systematic immersion contamination and polishing experiments were carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the acids in controlling alumina particulate <b>contamination</b> <b>on</b> <b>wafer</b> surfaces. The difference in the surface cleanliness was interpreted using the electrokinetic data and the calculated interaction energy between alumina particles and the wafer surface. Electrochemical tests showed no severe attack on tungsten films by the acids. Copper ions were found to adsorb onto the silicon dioxide surface, leading to copper contamination levels of upto 10 ¹³ atoms/cm². The extent of copper contamination was found to depend on the solution pH and the presence of additives such as hydrogen peroxide. Both electrokinetic measurements and immersion contamination experiments showed that citric acid can reduce the copper contamination on the silicon dioxide surface. TiN is more noble than tungsten in the solutions containing oxidants used in tungsten CMP slurries. The most significant corrosion of tungsten was found in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Copper was found to be more noble than tantalum in acidic solutions. However, in alkaline ammonium hydroxide solutions, the relative nobility of copper and tantalum can be reversed by adding hydrogen peroxide. The corrosion of tungsten and copper appears to be very minimally affected by coupling with TiN and tantalum, respectively...|$|E

It was also used to measure irregularly shaped silicon particles. Three sizes of PSL spheres (0. 199 µm, 0. 3 µm, and 0. 426 µm) were used to study the sizing accuracy and counting efficiency of this wafer scanner. The results show that this scanner sizes 0. 199 µm and 0. 3 µm PSL reasonably accurate. But it cannot size 0. 426 µm PSL very well. The background noise lever was so high that this scanner could not measure particles near its nominal lower detection limit: 0. 1 µm. It over-counted Si particles by 28 %. An electrostatic enhanced wafer deposition chamber was used to prepare the test wafers.

The XPS and GFAAS measured results indicate that FA/O is more efficient than NH 4 OH as a ligand. Cu <b>contaminations</b> <b>on</b> silicon <b>wafer</b> can be removed remarkably when adding a little FA/O to the cleaning solution or polishing slurry.

50|$|DLI uses a {{metallic}} vaporizer or an additional metal hot plate {{to convert the}} liquid to gas. This process works best for mid-range flow rates. At low flow rates there is little control and limited accuracy, while at high flow rates the process is susceptible to bubbles in the liquid, which generate erratic values. DLI offers a low operating cost, good flow control and limited safety issues. DLI can vaporize only limited quantities due to thermal transfer rates, {{and there is a}} potential for chemical decomposition. Most critically, it cannot provide any purification of the liquid being vaporized; everything in the liquid is vaporized into the process. With direct liquid injection systems, increasing flow rate leads to incomplete vaporization.

This method was applied to measuring THCs in a front opening universal pod (FOUP) under static and purge conditions. XCDA ® purge gas was used for this experiment. XCDA gas is clean dry air (CDA) purified with Aeronex ® purification technology to remove moisture to less than 1 part-per-billion (ppb) and hydrocarbons, sulfur, and siloxane contaminants to less than 1 ppt. The experiment reveals that a FOUP’s environment contains ppb levels of THCs under static conditions and ppt concentration levels of THCs under purge conditions. This test demonstrates that ppt purity gas can be delivered to and maintained in a FOUP. Finally, a silicon wafer is exposed to a FOUP environment under static and purge conditions.

Wafer scanning further breaks down into patterneddealt with {{by the use of}} extremely effective clean rooms and mini-environments, in which the wafers are not exposed to ambient air during handling. The dominant sources of particulate contamination in semiconductor manufacturing today are the process tools and fluids themselves. In many cases there is no good way to detect elevated concentrations of these particles before they have damaged a considerable number of wafers or to determine where and when the particles arise in the process. Many types of semiconductor-processing tools are important sources of particulate <b>contamination</b> <b>on</b> <b>wafers.</b> Some of the worst offenders are quartz- 1 product 2 wafer scanning and bare 1 monitor 2 wafer scanning. Patterned wafer scanners are in general more expensive, less sensitive, and slower than bare wafer scanners; this is because of the large back-ground signal from the wafer itself. This back-ground must be reduced by the use of techniques such as video-image processing, grazing-incidence dark-field detection, or spatial filtering, {{in order to make the}} particle signals detectable. On the other hand, many processes cannot be adequately tested with monitor wafers. When using monitors to test a process, a bare or blanket-film wafer is put into the volume of interest. The process under test is run, then the wafer is examined to determine how many particles were deposited during the process. An example of this approach is the use of monitor wafers to measure contamination in sputtering and other process chambers, which has been the most common approach for many years.

UPW has also a certain content of metal ions, which can be attached to silica. That means, when a wafer is in contact with UPW metal ion can directly and/or in form of a silica-metal conglomerate be attached to the wafer surface.

An efficient defect macromodeling methodology based on the rigorous two-dimensional (2 -D) topography simulator METROPOLE, has been developed to allow the prediction and correlation of the critical physical parameters (material, size, and location) of contamination in the manufacturing process to device defects.

In addition, particle deposition increased with gas flow rate at low flow rate, reaches a maximum, then decreased as flow rate increased further. Moreover, there was no observable effect on particle deposition due to pressure variation in the pressure range explored.

Metals like Cu and Fe {{are well known}} to cause lifetime degradation in silicon. Analytical methodologies for determination of surface metal contamination have been well established for mirror polished, {{also referred to as}} chemical mechanical polished (CMP) silicon substrates [1]. It will be explained why these methods cannot be merely applied to photovoltaic (PV) wafers because of the large roughness and specific topography of the surface. Here we extend and adapt these analytical methodologies for surface metal <b>contamination</b> analysis <b>on</b> PV substrates also referred to as PV wafers. We demonstrate how vapour phase decomposition droplet collection (VPD-DC) in combination with total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (TXRF) or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) has been modified to accommodate analysis on a non-polished PV silicon wafer surface. In addition we demonstrate how metal <b>contamination</b> <b>on</b> as-cut PV <b>wafers</b> has been determined by liquid surface etching (LSE), i. e. an oxidizing and slow etching solution used to dissolve metal contaminants, followed by TXRF analysis.

40|$|Shortly {{after the}} NASA Genesis Mission sample return capsule {{returned}} to earth on September 8, 2004, the science team discovered that all nine ultra-pure semiconductor materials were contaminated {{with a thin}} molecular organic film approximately 0 to 100 angstroms thick. The organic contaminate layer, possibly a silicone, situated {{on the surface of}} the materials is speculated to have formed by condensation of organic matter from spacecraft off-gassing at the Lagrange 1 halo orbit during times of solar exposure. While the valuable solar wind atoms are safely secured directly below this organic contamination and/or native oxide layer in approximately the first 1000 angstroms of the ultra-pure material substrate, some analytical techniques that precisely measure solar wind elemental abundances require the removal of this organic contaminate. In 2005, Genesis science team laboratories began to develop various methods for removing the organic thin film without removing the precious material substrate that contained the solar wind atoms. Stephen Sestak and colleagues at Open University first experimented with ultraviolet radiation ozone (UV/O 3) cleaning of several non-flight and flown Genesis silicon wafer fragments under a pure flowing oxygen environment. The UV/O 3 technique was able to successfully remove organic contamination without etching into the bulk material substrate. At NASA Johnson Space Center Genesis Curation Laboratory, we have installed an UV/O 3 cleaning devise in an ambient air environment to further experimentally test the removal of the organic <b>contamination</b> <b>on</b> Genesis <b>wafer</b> materials. Preliminary results from XPS analysis show that the UV/O 3 cleaning instrument is a good non-destructive method for removing carbon contamination from flown Genesis array samples. However, spectroscopic ellipsometry results show little change in the thickness of the surface film. All experiments to date have shown UV/O 3 cleaning method to be the best non-destructive method for removing organic contamination from the surface of the Genesis materials. The UV/O 3 cleaning process can also clean carbon contamination to levels below non-flight standards. This can be seen by comparing sample 60260 's carbon 10667 cps with non-flight Si carbon 21675 cps. Therefore, surface carbon contamination should not hinder the analysis of solar wind...|$|R
