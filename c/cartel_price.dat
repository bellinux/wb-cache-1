5000|$|The {{search for}} exploitable {{resources}} first resulted {{with the development}} of huge bituminous coal or [...] "soft" [...] coal deposits in the area for use in a growing iron foundry sector. However, {{it was not until the}} realization by Andrew Carnegie, that Western Pennsylvania possessed an optimum location for a very large scale American steel sector, that this area, especially Pittsburgh, became known for the industrial specialty that characterizes it today. The region also had large glass, pottery, brickmaking, and ceramic industries, which took advantage of the coal and the sand and clay in local soils. The local glass industry produced 45 percent of the nation's output in glass by the 1860s and more than 80 percent of the output by the 1920s. The rise and subsequent decline of the American steel industry at Pittsburgh introduces a host of complex economic concepts necessary to understand why that particular activity centered in this particular place, including the notions of classical Weberian location analysis for more than one input, the Pittsburgh Plus system for maintaining advantageous freight costs to ship to the market, vertical integration and supply innovations such as the development of the Mesabi Range, the ore freighter as a transport vehicle, and the construction of the Soo Locks. Other necessary economic concepts for description could well include economies of scale, diseconomies of scale, monopoly (or <b>cartel)</b> <b>price</b> equilibrium, and [...] "dumping". Labor relations problems historically were frequent in the earlier steel sector, and mention should be made of the United Steel Workers of America, as well as the contemporary issue of [...] "legacy costs" [...] arising from heavy entitlements to a large retired labor force after sharply downsizing to today's level of employment.|$|E
40|$|We analyze how {{leniency}} affects cartel pricing in an infinitely repeated oligopoly model {{where the}} fine rates {{are linked to}} illegal gains and detection probabilities depend {{on the degree of}} collusion. A novel aspect {{of this study is that}} we focus on the worst possible outcome. We investigate the maximal <b>cartel</b> <b>price,</b> the largest price for which the conditions for sustainability hold. We analyze how the maximal <b>cartel</b> <b>price</b> supported by different cartel strategies adjusts in response to the introduction of (ex-ante and ex-post) leniency programs. We disentangle the effects of traditional antitrust enforcement, leniency, and cartel strategies on the maximal <b>cartel</b> <b>price.</b> Ex-ante leniency cannot reduce the maximal <b>cartel</b> <b>price</b> below the price under antitrust without leniency. On the other hand, for ex-post leniency, improvement is possible and granting full immunity to single-reporting firms achieves the largest reduction in the maximal <b>cartel</b> <b>price.</b> To reduce adverse effects under both leniency programs, fine reductions to multiple-reporting firms should be moderate or absent. Finally, ex-post leniency should provide less generous fine reductions to multiple-reporting firms, which is supported by the current practice in the US and the EU...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a {{detailed study of}} the structure, behavior, and performance of the property and liability insurance industry in the United States. This property insurance industry is shown to possess all of the structural characteristics normally associated with competitive markets. Despite a competitive market structure, however, the property-liability insurance industry has traditionally set prices through cartel-like rating bureaus and {{has been subjected to}} pervasive state rate regulation. The study concludes that the combination of state regulation, <b>cartel</b> <b>pricing,</b> and other legal peculiarities has resulted in the use of an inefficient sales technique, supply shortages, and over-capitalization. Free entry, however, tends to drive profits toward the cost of capital. Based on recent experience in states where the competitive market is used to determine insurance rates, the study suggests a movement away from rate regulation and <b>cartel</b> <b>pricing</b> to open competition, as a means of eliminating prevailing performance problems. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper characterizes collusive pricing {{patterns}} when buyers may {{detect the}} presence of a cartel. Buyers are assumed to become suspicious when observed prices are anomalous. We find that the <b>cartel</b> <b>price</b> path is comprised of two phases. During the transitional phase, price is generally rising and relatively unresponsive to cost shocks. During the stationary phase, price responds to cost but is much less sensitive than under non-collusion or simple monopoly. The length of the transition phase is decreasing in the variance of cost shocks. It is also shown that the <b>cartel</b> <b>price</b> path may overshoot its long-run level so that price converges from above. ...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} ten years there has been a {{rigorous}} debate on how to improve anti-cartel enforcement in Europe. Introducing private enforcements systems, like in the US, was early in the process {{regarded as one of the}} most important steps for significant improvements. In contrast to public enforcement, private enforcement relies on adequate compensation to customers harmed by a cartel. But cartel damages are hard to calculate and the European Commission has therefore presented a draft guideline on how to quantify harm to assist courts and claimants. The focus in the guidance is on <b>price</b> effects, but <b>cartels</b> are also likely to cause other types of damage, such as efficiency effects. For example, a Swedish committee investigating cartels in the 1950 ’s stated that ”A monopolist or a cartel can charge too high prices in relation to its costs. A <b>cartel</b> determines <b>prices</b> after the least efficient firm in the cartel, and hence protects it” (SOU 1951 : 27). This statement reflects an early awareness that pricing and efficiency effects from cartels are deeply related, and jointly determines the harm for consumers. This thesis aims at re-joining the discussion of <b>cartel</b> <b>prices</b> and efficiencies for the purpose of determining cartel damages. It will focus on the issue outlined above, i. e. cartel behaviour and the harm caused by cartels when a cartel consists of members that are not symmetric in costs. Cost asymmetries can be both exogenous and endogenous to cartel formation, but rather than discussing why asymmetries arise, I will in the four chapters focus on the effect the asymmetries have on <b>cartel</b> <b>prices</b> and hence consumer harm...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{existence}} of <b>cartel</b> <b>pricing</b> and anticompetitive behavior by the Big 4 international providers of auditing services (resulting from the halving {{in the number of}} such providers from the Big 8 to Big 4). Increased audit market concentration, both globally and in Australia, together with the focus by the Big 4 in servicing primarily large clients, raises concern about a lessening of competition in the audit marketplace. Using both a composite and dis-aggregated measure for auditor attributes (namely, auditor reputation, industry specialization, provision of non-audit services and auditor tenure), this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the association between four pivotal auditor attributes and the quantum of audit fees and changes in audit fees paid by Australian publicly listed firms during a five-year time frame. The final usable sample includes 600 firm-year observations as data points for the 2001, 2003 and 2005 calendar years (200 firm-years for each year in the aforementioned observation window) and is obtained entirely from publicly available sources, specifically annual reports. Main results from both cross-sectional and longitudinal multivariate analysis indicate that there is no significant association between the four auditor attributes utilized in this study with both audit fees and variation in audit fees. Robustness and sensitivity testing completed also largely support the non-significance of the association between both constructs. This study, therefore, finds no evidence of <b>cartel</b> <b>pricing</b> and anti-competitive behavior by Big 4 auditors resulting from increased audit market concentration.

The apparently large size of government fines is distorted by one overwhelming case. Moreover, deterrence is frustrated by the failure of compensatory private suits to take hold outside of North America and the near absence of fines in most Asian jurisdictions.

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{assessment}} of private damages that the cartelization of a market imposes on buyers in that market and, possibly, on the buyers' own customers in further market downstream. Abstracting from procedural problems and focussing on conceptual issues, the paper argues that damages comprise not just the overcharge on the actual quantity purchased, but also foregone profits on the units that are not purchased because the <b>cartel</b> <b>price</b> {{is higher than the}} competitive price. The paper also argues that the passing-on defense against claims by direct buyers is flawed because it neglects the business loss effect that is associated with a direct buyer's raising his own price to pass the higher <b>cartel</b> <b>price</b> on to his own customers. If direct buyers are not in competition with each other, a revealed-preference argument shows that the business loss effect on the direct buyer's profits is necessarily greater than the effect of the increase in revenues per unit that is sold. The overcharge on the actual quantity purchased again is a lower bound for actual damages. The assessment of damages suffered by indirect buyers is independent of this refutation of the passing-on defense. If direct buyers are in competition with each other, there is an additional business gain effect because the cartelization upstream raises rivals' costs and thereby affects the competition between the direct buyers. In this case, {{the assessment of}} damages depends on the treatment of causation i. e., to what extent a direct buyer's competitors' price increases are ascribed to the cartelization upstream. Consistency requires that, for claims raised at the level of direct and indirect buyers alike, the same treatment of causation should be used. Either the cartel members should be held responsible for the entire shift in the equilibrium of the strategic game between direct buyers in suits involving indirect buyers, as well as direct buyers, or a ceteris paribus assumption should be applied to the actions of a direct buyer's competitors, which eliminates the business gain effect resulting from their price increases. In the latter treatment, which seems conceptually and procedurally the simplest, the overcharge on the actual quantity purchased is again a lower bound for actual damages...|$|E

Since the welfare consequences of collusion are important irrespective of whether collusion is tacit or explicit, finding out more about whether and when tacit cartels can be expected to occur should be important for policy. A successful tacit cartel, like any cartel, must solve two problems: (i) The members must agree on a <b>cartel</b> <b>price</b> and on an allocation mechanism which determines how much each member produces.
