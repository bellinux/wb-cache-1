5|$|After {{serving as}} the most {{influential}} policymaking body of the dynasty {{for more than a}} century, the Deliberative Council was displaced and then made obsolete by the more ethnically mixed Grand Council, which the Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1722–1735) created in the late 1720s to <b>circumvent</b> the influence of the deliberative princes and ministers. The Deliberative Council was formally abolished in 1792.|$|E

5|$|Although female life {{expectancy}} in Byzantium {{was lower than}} that of men, due to death in childbirth, wars and the fact that men married younger, female widowhood was still fairly common.

5|$|Constitutional {{questions}} {{may also be}} referred to the Tribunal when Parliament attempts to <b>circumvent</b> or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. If the attempt is by way of an ordinary bill, the President can exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to it. It is then open to Cabinet to advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact circumvents or curtails his discretionary powers. If the bill is determined by the Tribunal not to have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. When Article 5A of the Constitution is brought into force, a similar procedure will apply to attempts to <b>circumvent</b> or curtail the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. If the Tribunal rules that the proposed amendment does have the effect of restricting the discretionary powers of the President, the Prime Minister is entitled to submit the bill to a national referendum for approval.|$|E

5|$|A {{scheme to}} <b>circumvent</b> the settler grants {{altogether}} soon emerged. A railroad official hired a surveyor and logger named Stephen A.

In 1904, an investigation by The Oregonian uncovered the scandal, by which time it had grown to such a magnitude that the paper reported that more than 75% of the land sales had violated federal law.|$|E

The Hetch Hetchy Valley – then compared to Yosemite Valley for its scenic beauty – was chosen for its water quality and hydroelectric potential, but the location within the national park generated controversy. An act of Congress was required to <b>circumvent</b> federal protection of the Tuolumne River, with the reasoning that public land should be developed for the public benefit.|$|E
