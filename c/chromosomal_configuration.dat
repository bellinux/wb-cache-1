Although {{this process is}} not well understood, high-resolution imaging of live mouse oocytes has revealed that chromosomes form an intermediate <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configuration,</b> called the prometaphase belt, which occurs prior to biorientation. Kitajima, et al. estimate that about 90% of chromosomes require correction of the kinetochore-microtubule attachments (using Aurora kinase [...] )prior to obtaining correct biorientation. This suggests a possible cause for the elevated frequency of abnormal chromosome counts (aneuploidy) in mammals.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} the precise positioning of a reporter gene within heterochromatin {{where it may}} be silenced. A transposition of the 59 E- 60 A region into pericentric heterochromatin ensnares distal 59 E- 60 A via somatic pairing. The frequency with which a brown (bw) reporter gene in 59 E is silenced is influenced by <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configurations.</b> Silencing occurs only when the bw+ reporter is unpaired due to heterozygosity with a deficiency, where the frequency of bw+ reporter expression is correlated with the extent of bw gene and flanking sequence present. Surprisingly, the frequency of pairing between the transposition in heterochromatin and distal 59 E observed cytologically is indistinguishable from the frequency of pairing of homologous chromosomes at 59 E in wild-type larval brains, regardless of configuration. Therefore, bringing a susceptible reporter gene into close proximity with heterochromatin does not necessarily affect its expression, but local pairing changes resulting from altered <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configurations</b> can lead to silencing. We also find that an ensnared distal copy of bw that is interrupted by a heterochromatic insertion enhances silencing. This demonstrates that bw can be simultaneously acted upon by pericentric and distal blocks of heterochromatin...|$|R
40|$|Morphological, genetical and a {{s well as}} cytological {{studies were}} carried out on certain {{progenies}} of the asynaptic wild senna (Cassia Tora Linne) found in the progeny of the wild senna collected in the open field situated in the neighbourhood of the center of Atomic-bomb Explosion on Aug. 9, 1945, at Nagasaki City. The results obtained are briefly summarized as follows : 1. Thirteen trisomic plants discovered in the progenies of the asynaptic plants in 1952 were easily distinguished from both the normal and the asynaptic ones by the lesser expression of vigours at their seedling stage. Specific characters, such as the smallness of the petals and as the protruding pistils at late flower-bud stage, were noticed in these trisomic plants. The shape, size and colo it of the petals in these trisomic plants were slender, much smaller and fainter, respectively, than those of the original asynaptic plant. From the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configurations</b> at the reduction division, these trisomic plants could be divided into two groups, that is, the first group, consisting of nine trisomic plants, showed the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configurations</b> such as 1 _ 111 + 12 _ 11, 13 _ 11 + 1 _ 1, 1 _ 111 + 11 _ 11 + 2 _ 1 or 12 _ 11 + 3 _ 1 at diakinesis and at MI. Each plant in the second group, consisting of four other trisomic plants contained, however, asynaptic genes in homozygotic state in addition to an extra chromosome. From the progeny analysis of reciprocal crossings between the normal and the trisomic plants, it was acertained that the trisomic nature could be transmitted in about 3. 8 per cent of offspring through pollen-grains and 17 per cent through ovules. 2. In 1951, a highly sterile plant with two extra chromosomes (SL. 31 - 1) was discovered in the F_ 3 generation of the crossing between the asynaptic and the normal plants. This plant started to flower about ten days later than the normal one. It could be easily distinguished by the smallness of their petals and the protruding pistils in the young-bud stage. From their <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configurations,</b> such as 2111 + 1111, at diakinesis and at MI, the plant was determined as a double trisomic form and the author could assume that the plant may have arisen from the mating of (n+α+b) - and (n) -gametes. 3. In 1952, a completely sterile plant with two extra chromesomes occurred among the progeny of a trisomic plant. The plant was smaller in size and less in vigour than the parent trisomic one. From the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configurations</b> at diakinesis and at MI, such as l_iv+ 12 _ 11, l_iv+ 11 _ 11 + 2 _i or 14 _ii, it was concluded that the plant was a tetrasomic form, having two extra homologous chromosomes in addition. As stated above, it was duly presumed that the plant may have been induced through the selling of the trisomic form. 4. In 1950, a completely sterile plant was discovered among the progeny of an asynaptic plant. This plant did not differed in its plant height compared with the normal one, but made clear the degeneration of their stamens and showed their malformed pistils in various degrees. Moreover, it started flowering one month later than the normal plant. From the results of the cytological observations the plant was determined as a monosomic one along with asynapsis. これまでの研究から,原爆被爆エビスグサの後代に分離した高不稔性個体は,いわゆる染色体不対合現象をしめし,かつ単劣性因子の支配をうけていることが明らかになつた(永松, 1949;片山, 1953 a). またこのような不対合個体の後代にはさまざまな異数体や倍数体の出現することが知られている(Beadle, 1930;Ehrenberg, 1949). すでに不対合エビスグサの後代に偶発した巨大型三染色体植物については報告したところであるが(Katayama, 1953 b),ここにはその他の異数個体について行なつた形態学的ならびに細胞遺伝学的研究の結果について述べる. 稿を進めるに当り,日頃助言と指導を賜わり,かつ校閲の労をとられた永松,福島両教授に厚くお礼を申し上げる...|$|R

Indeed, heteroploidy may be a necessary corollary or even the cause of the altera-tion of primary or diploid cells in vitro to the status of a cell line. Such changes in chromosome number appear to be independent of the type of primary tissue since they have been observed in cells derived from both normal and malignant tissue [4, 22, 23, 311. These cell lines, of which over two hundred have been reported in the literature, have serious limitations for many kinds of biological studies. Chief among these is the exclusion of their use for the production of human virus vaccines. This limitation is based on the supposition that such hetero-ploid cell lines, whether of normal or malignant origin, share many of the properties of malignant cells [29, 30, 371. This objection would be even more important if viruses played a role in human neoplasia. In general, i...|$|E
40|$|Transcription of the tetA(K) {{tetracycline}} resistance determinant encoded by an IS 257 -flanked cointegrated {{copy of a}} pT 181 -like plasmid, {{located within}} the chromosomal mec region of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolate, has been investigated. The results demonstrated that transcription of tetA(K) in this strain is directed by both an IS 257 -derived hybrid promoter, which is stronger than the native tetA(K) promoter in the autonomous form of pT 181, and a complete outwardly directed promoter identified within one end of IS 257. Despite lower gene dosage, the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configuration</b> was shown to afford {{a higher level of}} resistance than that mediated by pT 181 in an autonomous multicopy state. Furthermore, competition studies revealed that a strain carrying the chromosomal tetA(K) determinant exhibited a higher level of fitness in the presence of tetracycline but not in its absence. This finding suggests that tetracycline has been a selective factor in the emergence of strains carrying a cointegrated pT 181 -like plasmid in their chromosomes. The results highlight the potential of IS 257 to influence the expression of neighboring genes, a property likely to enhance its capacity to mediate advantageous genetic rearrangements...|$|E
40|$|Over the years, {{substantial}} gains {{have been}} made in locating regions of agricultural genomes associated with characteristics, diseases, and agroeconomic traits. These gains have relied heavily on the ability to statistically estimate the association between DNA markers and regions of a genome (quantitative trait loci or QTL) related to a particular trait. The majority of these advances have focused on diploid species, even though many important agricultural crops are, in fact, polyploid. The purpose of our work is to initiate an algorithmic approach for model selection and QTL detection in polyploid species. This approach involves the construction of all possible <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configurations</b> (models) that may result in a gamete, model reduction based on estimation of marker dosage from progeny data, and lastly model selection.

There {{do not appear to be}} major genetic impacts on the changes in bone physiology. Also immune functions are rather unaffected and the evidence for an increase of autoimmune disease in MtoF is preliminary. Brain functions of transsexuals may have differed from controls before cross-sex hormones; they do undergo shifts upon cross-sex hormone treatment, but there is no evidence for changes in sex-specific brain disease. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease is higher in MtoF receiving oestrogens than in FtoM receiving androgens.

Little is known regarding genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of Domoic Acid (DA), the major Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP) toxin. Both OA and DA occur in seafood and are of human health concerns. Micronuclei (MN) arise from abnormalities in nuclear division during mitosis due to a failure of the mitotic spindle or by complex <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configurations</b> that pose problems during anaphase. In order to evaluate the ability of okadaic acid (OA) and domoic acid (DA) to induce DNA damage we performed the micronucleus assay using the Caco- 2 cell line.

Our results showed that OA and DA significantly increased the frequency of MN in Caco- 2 cells. The MN caused by OA are found in mononucleated cells and binucleated cells, whereas those caused by DA are mainly in binucleated cells.

40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} genome of Neurospora {{is usually}} {{found in a}} single covalently closed circular 62 -kbp DNA molecule. We report here that the mitochondrial genome of a phenotypic revertant of a stopper mutant (stp-ruv) is contained primarily in two separate, nonoverlapping, autonomously replicating circular chromosomes. The circles, one about 21 kbp and the other somewhat less than 36 kbp are derived from the most frequent classes of recombinant chromosomes (21 and 41 kbp) in the chromosomal population of mitochondria in the original stopper mutant.

40|$|We {{explored}} {{the use of}} a cascade circuit for heterologous gene expression that consists of a regulatory module with a salicylate-inducible system that controls the expression of a second regulator, xylS 2, whose product is activated by common inducers. Activation and increasing the concentration of the second regulator synergistically induced heterologous genes downstream of the Pm promoter in the expression module. This module can be placed in multicopy vectors or in the chromosome of a host strain by means of minitransposons. Using reporter genes, we evaluated gene regulation capacity and gross production of the system with different configurations. The highest yield was obtained when the expression module was in a multicopy plasmid after a 6 -h induction. However, expression modules in plasmids showed low stability after induction even with selective pressure. The <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configuration</b> had the lowest basal levels and induced levels comparable to those of plasmid configurations, resulting in accumulation of more than 10 % of the total protein. Unlike the configurations in plasmids, the yield was maintained for at least 3 days even without selective pressure. In conclusion, the cascade system in the chromosome configuration is more efficient for long-term fermentation because of the great stability of the overexpressing phenotype in spite of the high levels of expression...|$|E
40|$|Recombination between {{insertion}} sequence copies can cause genetic deletion, inversion, or duplication. However, {{it is difficult}} to assess the fraction of all genomic rearrangements that involve {{insertion sequence}}s. In previous gene duplication and amplifi-cation studies of Acinetobacter baylyi ADP 1, an insertion sequence was evident in approximately 2 % of the characterized dupli-cation sites. Gene amplification occurs frequently in all organisms and has a significant impact on evolution, adaptation, drug resistance, cancer, and various disorders. To understand the molecular details of this important process, a previously developed system was used to analyze gene amplification in selected mutants. The current study focused on amplification events in two chromosomal regions that are near one of six copies of the only transposable element in ADP 1, IS 1236 (an IS 3 family member). Twenty-one independent mutants were analyzed, and in contrast to previous studies of a different chromosomal region, IS 1236 was involved in 86 % of these events. IS 1236 -mediated amplification could occur through homologous recombination between insertion sequences on both sides of a duplicated region. However, this mechanism presupposes that transposition generates an appropriately positioned additional copy of IS 1236. To evaluate this possibility, PCR and Southern hybridization were used to determine the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configurations</b> of amplificationmutants involving IS 1236. Surprisingly, the genomic patterns were inconsistent with the hypothesis that intramolecular homologous recombination occurred between insertion sequences follow-ing an initial transposition event. These results raise a novel possibility that the gene amplification events near the IS 1236 ele-ments arise from illegitimate recombination involving transposase-mediated DNA cleavage...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Conflicting {{results have}} been {{reported}} {{regarding the use of}} polarized microscopy as a predictive tool for human oocyte quality. METHODS: Oocytes from 121 ICSI cycles were analysed with polarized microscopy. Both qualitative (spindle presence) and quantitative (retardance) data were correlated to the key assisted reproduction technology outcome parameters. Second, polarized microscopy was applied on in vitro matured (IVM) oocytes from germinal vesicle oocytes that matured after 24 or 48 h and from metaphase I oocytes matured after 3 or 24 h. These data were correlated with confocal analysis of spindle-chromosome complex. RESULTS: Spindles were detected in 82 % of in vivo matured oocytes and in 64 % adjacent to the first polar body (PB). Fertilization rate was higher in oocytes with a visible spindle (P = 0. 0002). In patients aged over 35 years, the percentage of a visible spindle and mean spindle retardance was lower than in younger patients (P < 0. 03). A higher number of spindles were located adjacent to the first PB in IVM matured oocytes (94 %) versus in vivo matured oocytes (P < 0. 0001). Confocal imaging revealed that spindle absent IVM metaphase II (MII) oocytes had a higher degree of aberrant spindle and <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configurations</b> versus IVM MII oocytes with a visible spindle (P = 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS: Oocytes with absent spindles were associated with lower fertilization rates and advanced female age. Other important outcome parameters (embryo quality, pregnancy rates) were not correlated to spindle nor zona inner layer analysis. Interestingly, confocal imaging showed that polarized microscopy might be used as a qualitative predictive tool of human oocyte quality but no correlation could be demonstrated with quantitative polarized microscopy...|$|R

In conclusion, both OA and DA bear mutagenic potential as revealed in Caco- 2 cells by induction of MN formation. Moreover, OA induced whole chromosome loss suggesting a specific aneugenic potential, whereas DA seems simply clastogenic.

For {{one of the two}} new species, Acomys ngurui Verheyen et al. 2011, a polymorphic karyotype has been observed. In fact, for 19 of the 22 karyotyped individuals, the karyotype is identical to the one described for A. spinosissimus s. s.

40|$|AbstractHigh-resolution {{physically}} ordered gene {{maps for}} equine homologs of human chromosome 5 (HSA 5), viz., horse chromosomes 14 and 21 (ECA 14 and ECA 21), were generated by adding 179 new loci (131 gene-specific and 48 microsatellites) {{to the existing}} maps of the two chromosomes. The loci were mapped primarily by genotyping on a 5000 -rad horse×hamster radiation hybrid panel, of which 28 were mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The approximately fivefold {{increase in the number}} of mapped markers on the two chromosomes improves the average resolution of the map to 1 marker/ 0. 9  Mb. The improved resolution is vital for rapid chromosomal localization of traits of interest on these chromosomes and for facilitating candidate gene searches. The comparative gene mapping data on ECA 14 and ECA 21 finely align the chromosomes to sequence/gene maps of a range of evolutionarily distantly related species. It also demonstrates that compared to ECA 14, the ECA 21 segment corresponding to HSA 5 is a more conserved region because of preserved gene order in a larger number of and more diverse species. Further, comparison of ECA 14 and the distal three-quarters region of ECA 21 with corresponding chromosomal segments in 50 species belonging to 11 mammalian orders provides a broad overview of the evolution of these segments in individual orders from the putative ancestral <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configuration.</b> Of particular interest is the identification and precise demarcation of equid/Perissodactyl-specific features that for the first time clearly distinguish the origins of ECA 14 and ECA 21 from similar-looking status in the Cetartiodactyls...|$|E

For the former, amplified regions generally retain their native <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configuration</b> and involve a single amplification target sequence. For complex amplicons, amplified DNAs usually undergo substantial reorganization relative to the normal chromosomal regions from which they evolve, and the regions subject to amplification may contain multiple target sequences. Previous efforts to characterize the 7 p 11. 2 epidermal growth factor receptor) amplicon in glioblastoma have relied primarily {{on the use of}} markers positioned by linkage analysis and/or radiation hybrid mapping, both of which are known to have the potential for being inaccurate when attempting to order loci over relatively short (< 1 Mb) chromosomal regions.

Our data indicate that EGFR is the sole amplification target within the mapped region, although there are several additional 7 p 11. 2 genes that can be coamplified and overexpressed with EGFR.

By using chromosome conformation capture techniques, {{we found that}} in B cells, the Emicro and 3 'Ealpha enhancers were in close spatial proximity, forming a unique <b>chromosomal</b> loop <b>configuration.</b> B cell activation led to recruitment of the germline transcript (GLT) promoters to the Emicro: 3 'Ealpha complex in a cytokine-dependent fashion. This structure facilitated S-S synapsis because Smicro was proximal to Emicro and a downstream S region was corecruited with the targeted GLT promoter to Emicro: 3 'Ealpha. We propose that GLT promoter association with the Emicro: 3 'Ealpha complex creates an architectural scaffolding that promotes S-S synapsis during CSR and that these interactions are stabilized by AID. Thus, the S-S synaptosome {{is formed as a}} result of the self-organizing transcription system that regulates GLT expression and may serve to guard against spurious chromosomal translocations...|$|R

Since CYP 1 A 1 was inducible to a much greater degree than CYP 1 B 1, we hypothesized {{that there may be}} differences in coactivator recruitment to the promoter and/or enhancer regions of these genes. Dioxin treatment leads to recruitment of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor to the enhancer regions but not to the proximal promoter regions of both the CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 B 1 genes. On the other hand, dioxin treatment facilitated recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoters but not the enhancer regions. Dioxin treatment also elicited recruitment of the transcriptional coactivators, steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC- 1) and steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC- 2) and p 300, which possess intrinsic histone acetyltranferase activities, to both genes, whereas Brahma (BRM) /Switch 2 -related gene 1 (BRG- 1), a subunit of nucleosomal remodeling factors, was recruited more robustly to CYP 1 A 1 relative to CYP 1 B 1. Small inhibitory RNA-mediated knockdown of p 300 and SRC- 2 adversely affected dioxin induction of both genes, whereas knockdown of BRM/BRG- 1 reduced CYP 1 A 1 induction but had little, if any, effect on CYP 1 B 1 induction. These results suggest that nucleosomal remodeling is less significant for dioxin-mediated induction of CYP 1 B 1 than that of CYP 1 A 1 and {{may be related to the}} more modest inducibility of the former. Interestingly, simultaneous knockdown of SRC- 2 and BRM/BRG- 1 had no greater effect on CYP 1 A 1 induction than knockdown of each coactivator individually, while simultaneous knockdown of p 300 and BRM/BRG- 1 had a much greater effect than knockdown of each individual gene, suggesting that the recruitment of SRC- 2 to CYP 1 A 1 depends upon BRM/BRG- 1, while the recruitments of p 300 and BRM/BRG- 1 are independent of each other. These observations provide novel insights into the functional roles of the endogenous coactivators in dioxin induction of the human CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 B 1 genes in their natural <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configurations...</b>|$|R

Ultrastructural analysis of microspread nuclei revealed SCs with a well-preserved structure until late substages of prophase I, but did not detect kinetochore plates and recombination nodules. Pachytene cells of R. agamemnon, R. rochai and T. bahiensis exhibited single and unsynapsed axes continuous with totally synapsed SCs, indicating the occurrence of heterozygous chromosomal rearrangements. Although chromosome chains were not observed in T. fasciolatus, the presence of gaps and interlocks points out that this species also carries heterozygous rearrangements, involving a small chromosome segment. Especially in R. rochai, the cellular microspreading analysis was useful to clarify the origin of inter-and intraindividual variation {{in the number of}} bivalent-like elements and in the number of chromosomes involved in multivalent associations. It was found that more chromosomes were involved in rearrangements than previously established through investigations using light microscopy alone. (C) 2015 S.

40|$|Objectives: Asynchrony between {{nuclear and}} cytoplasmic maturation, and {{possibly}} {{damage to the}} oocyte meiotic spindle, limits the application of in vitro maturation (IVM) in assisted reproduction. Several {{studies have suggested that}} Prematuration with meiosis blockers may improve oocyte quality after IVM, favoring early embryogenesis. Thus, we investigated the effect of Prematuration with the nuclear maturation inhibitor butyrolactone I (BLI) on the meiotic spindle and <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configuration</b> of bovine oocytes. Study design: Immature oocytes obtained from cows slaughtered in a slaughterhouse (n = 840) were divided into the following groups: (1) control (n = 325), submitted only to IVM in TCM 199 for 24 h; (2) BLI 18 h (n = 208) submitted to meiotic blockage with 100 mu M BLI for 24 h (Prematuration) and then induction of IVM in TCM 199 for 18 h; and (3) BLI 24 h (n = 307), pre-matured with 100 mu m BLI for 24 h followed by 24 h of IVM in TCM 199. The oocytes were then fixed, stained by immunofluorescence for morphological visualization of both microtubules and chromatin, and evaluated. Results: Meiotic arrest occurred in 90. 2 % of the oocytes cultured with BLI. Maturation rates were similar for all groups (80. 3 %, 73. 6 % and 82. 7 % for the control, BLI 18 h and BLI 24 h groups, respectively). We observed 81. 3 % normal oocytes in metaphase II in the control group, and 80. 0 % and 81. 2 % in the BLI 18 h and BLI 24 h groups, respectively. The incidence of meiotic anomalies did not differ between groups (18. 7 %, 20. 0 % and 18. 8 % for the control, BLI 18 h and BLI 24 h, respectively). Conclusion: Prematuration with butyrolactone I reversibly arrests meiosis without damaging the meiotic spindle or the chromosome distribution of bovine oocytes after in vitro maturation.

40|$|The Gossypium genus {{includes}} 45 diploid and 5 tetraploid cotton {{species of}} which only 2 diploids and 2 tetraploids are cultivated {{in different parts}} of the tropics and sub-tropics, leaving the remaining diploid and tetraploid species as potential genetic sources for novel trait introgression. The reniform nematode (Rotylenchulus reniformis Linford and Oliveira) poses significant problems to US cultivated Upland cottons (Gossypium hirsutum L., 2 n= 52), all of which lack high resistance. This work was in collaboration with the USDA-ARS team that focussed on introgressing reniform nematode-resistance from a diploid cotton species, Gossypium longicalyx Hutch. & Lee into G. hirsutum by creating a tri-species hybrid, HLA and backcross breeding (Bell et al., 2007; Robinson et al., 2007). The main objectives of this work were [1] to cytogenetically evaluate and help select superior types at each introgressed generation; [2] to identify molecular markers tightly linked to the reniform nematode-resistance gene and to map the resistance loci; [3] (A) to introgress germplasm on a genome-wide basis, (B) to evaluate introgressed germplasm for traits of economic importance other than reniform nematode resistance, and (C) to evaluate breeding methodologies in terms of this specialized breeding material. Reniform nematode resistant plants were of diverse cytogenetic constitution but individuals that modally formed 26 II <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configuration</b> were identified at BC 2 F 1, BC 3 F 1, BC 4 F 1, and BC 5 F 1 generations. Three SSR markers, BNL 3279 _ 114, BNL 1066 _ 156, and BNL 836 _ 215 and one phenotypic marker, green-colored fuzz (Fzglon), were identified to be tightly-linked to the resistance locus. Extension of the association analysis and linkage estimation to 16 susceptible self progeny (BC 1 S 1, BC 3 S 1 and BC 6 S 1) and 374 susceptible backcross hybrids (BC 2 F 1 -BC 8 F 1) mapped the resistance locus to chromosome 11 of cotton with BNL 3279 _ 114 on one side and Fzglon on the other at 0. 8 cM and 2. 8 cM, respectively. Besides reniform nematode-resistance introgression, genome-wide introgression efforts were also conducted. Low micronaire and high fiber strength were the two most promising traits identified in the HLA-derived introgressed generations. Most of the introgressed generations had high variability for the fiber-quality traits than the commercial checks, thus providing more opportunities for selection and improvement...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNowadays, human oocytes/embryos are cryopreserved via slow {{freezing}} or vitrification. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate a rapid warming protocol for slow-frozen human oocytes based on the standard warming procedure for vitrification. This was a prospective study on 216 sibling oocytes randomized for either conventional rapid thawing or rapid warming with vitrification warming solution. The primary endpoint was morphological assessment of survival at 2 h. Surviving oocytes were divided into two subgroups: (i) parthenogenetically activated; and (ii) fixed and observed for spindle/chromosome configuration. Secondary endpoints were parthenogenetic development and spindle/metaphase configuration. Survival rate with rapid warming was higher (92 / 102, 90. 2 %) than with rapid thawing (85 / 114, 74. 6 %; P= 0. 005), and after 3 d of culture the rapidly warmed parthenotes had more blastomeres compared with those rapidly thawed (P= 0. 042). Meiotic spindle and <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configuration</b> were not significantly influenced by rapid warming or rapid thawing. The finding of this study allows IVF centres to increase the efficiency of oocyte {{slow freezing}}, enabling survival rates comparable to vitrification protocols, and potentially to optimize costs by using the same warming protocol for both slow-frozen and vitrified reproductive cells. Nowadays, human oocytes/embryos are cryopreserved via slow freezing or vitrification. Due to the high survival rate guaranteed by vitrification, this procedure is increasingly applied worldwide. Nevertheless, to date, perhaps millions of slow-frozen oocytes/embryos have already been stored in IVF cryobanks. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate a rapid warming protocol for slow-frozen human oocytes based on the standard warming procedure for vitrification in order to optimize the slow freezing survival rate and reduce costs by using the same solutions for both slow freezing and vitrification warming. Between December 2012 and January 2013, 216 slow-frozen oocytes donated for research were randomized for the rapid thawing conventionally used for slow-frozen oocytes, or rapid warming as for vitrification protocols. We observed that rapid warming significantly increased the survival rate of slow-frozen oocytes; furthermore, slow-frozen oocytes warmed via rapid warming had better developmental competence than their sibling counterparts thawed with conventional rapid thawing. The application of this warming protocol allows us to increase the efficiency of oocyte slow freezing procedure, enabling survival rates comparable with that reported in previous vitrification studies. This finding redefines the scenario of slow-frozen and vitrification, confirming the pivotal role of warming and indicating that the results obtained until now with slow-frozen oocytes/embryos can be improved; this could be the biggest breakthrough in human oocyte cryopreservation since the introduction of vitrification. Furthermore, this finding allows IVF centres to reduce costs by using the same ‘universal warming protocol’ for both slow-frozen and vitrifed reproductive cells...|$|E
40|$|While {{extensive}} {{progress has}} been made in quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping for diploid species, similar progress in QTL mapping for polyploids has been limited due to the complex genetic architecture of polyploids. To date, QTL mapping in polyploids has focused mainly on tetraploids with dominant and/or codominant markers. Here, we extend this view to include any even ploidy level under a dominant marker system. Our approach first selects the most likely <b>chromosomal</b> marker <b>configurations</b> using a Bayesian selection criterion and then fits an interval-mapping model to each candidate. Profiles of the likelihood-ratio test statistic and the maximum-likelihood estimates (MLEs) of parameters including QTL effects are obtained via the EM algorithm. Putative QTL are then detected using a resampling-based significance threshold, and the corresponding parental configuration is identified to be the underlying parental configuration from which the data are observed. Although presented via pseudo-doubled backcross experiments, this approach can be readily extended to other breeding systems. Our method is applied to single-dose restriction fragment autotetraploid alfalfa data, and the performance is investigated through simulation studies...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Chromosomal {{abnormalities}} {{frequently are}} associated with impairment or arrest of spermatogen-esis in mammals but are compatible with fertility in female carriers of the same anomaly. In the case of trisomy, mice have extra genomic DNA {{as well as the}} chromosomal abnormality, usually present as an extra, unpaired chromo-some. Thus, impairment of spermatogenesis in trisomic males could be due to the presence of extra genomic material (i. e. triplicated genes) or due to the chromosomal abnormality and presence of an unpaired chromosome in meiosis. METHODS: In this study, fertility and <b>chromosomal</b> pairing <b>configurations</b> during meiotic prophase were analysed in male mice trisomic for different segments of the genome. Four have an extra segmental or tertiary trisomic chro-mosome—Ts(1716) 65 Dn, Ts(1016) 232 Dn, Ts(1217) 4 Rk and Ts(417) 2 Lws—and one has the triplicated segment attached to another chromosome—Ts(16 C-tel) 1 Cje. Ts(1716) 65 Dn and Ts(16 C-tel) 1 Cje have similar gene content triplication and differ primarily in whether the extra DNA is in an extra chromosome or not. RESULTS: The presence of an intact extra chromosome, rather than trisomy per se, is associated with male sterility. Additionally, sterility is corre-lated with a high frequency of association of the unpaired chromosome with the XY body, which contains the largely unpaired X and Y chromosomes. CONCLUSIONS: Intact extra chromosomes disrupt spermatogenesis, and unpaired chromosomes establish a unique chromatin territory within meiotic nuclei.

40|$|Studies based upon; 9012 Interspecific sexual crosses (attempted in 42, 96 and 18 amphidiploid-amphidiploid, amphidiploid-diploid and diploid-diploid {{combinations}} respectively), and chromosomal {{associations in}} 5 species, 8 digenomic triploids, 3 trigenomic haploids and 2 induced colchiploids are presented here. Crosses were attempted among fourteen genotypes, three each of B. nigra, B. campestris, B. juncea, B. napus {{and two of}} B. carinata. Sum of 2645, 4823 and 1544 pollinations were made at the amphidiploid-amphidiploid, amphidiploid-diploid and diploid-diploid levels, respectively. The crossibility was very high at amphidiploid- amphidiploid ploidy level. Brassica napus and B. juncea among the species and B. juncea X B. napus among the combinations/direction of cross proved highly crossible. Brassica juncea crossed freely with Brassica napus and B. campestris, and fairly with B. carinata and B. nigra. Brassica napus neither proved as a good seed parent or as a good pollinator with B. carinata. None out of 267 pollinations attempted In 6 combinations of B. campestris x B. carinata produced any hybrid seed. Hence Brassica juncea among the species and Jun 9 among its genotypes proved the highly crossible {{and can be used}} as bridge for genetic transgression across the genomes. The cross-compatibility at every level demonstrated the monophyletic origin of Brassica species. The highly crossible amphidiploids however determine their relative phylogenetic closeness as compared to the diploids. Chromosomally B. campestris (2 N) proved as ideal diploids with 1 / 1 synapsis and 1 - 1 disjunction. Neither any secondary association nor any B chromosomes was observed in its PMC's, at Ml. Autoploidy was induced through applying 0. 02 70 aqueous colchicine to the seedlings of Brassica campestris and it was concluded that, its 6 hours treatment is threshold for colchiploidy induction in Brassica. In autotetraploids however, the chromosomes were oriented into asyndetics, one or two-chiasmatic bivalents, trivalents and quadrivalents. The anomalous chromosomal behavior predicts the imbalance chromosomal disjunction; resulting into viable aberrant gametes the union of such gametes could give rise to individuals, with a variety of genome constitutions. Meiotic analysis of autotetraploids that, autoploidy and the union of their aberrant gametes has probably {{played an important role in}} the evolution of the present Brassica species. Meiotic analysis in 8 digenomic triploids, 4 each containing genomes AAC and AAB, and 3 trigenomic haploids containing genomes ABC revealed univalent, bivalent and multivalent <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configurations</b> of various orientations. Variation in pollen fertility was so evident even within a plant and tetrads ranging from all the fertile to all the sterile gametocytes with variety of all the possible intermediates were available. Though variation among chromosomal association was present at the combinations and association levels uniformity in the frequency of the synaptic and asynaptic chromosomes was uniforl 1 l i. e. 70 and 30 percent respectively either in the case of digenomic triploids or trigenomic haploids. Ml associations both in digenomic triploids or trigenomic haploids showed that, no one among the genomes B or C had got any genetic factor for suppressing the homoeologous pairing among genomes A, from various sources. Besides autosyndesis among the genomes A, allosyndesis was also evident among the genomes A, C and B from the same or different sources, respectively. Furthermore meiotic regularity was higher in the digenomic triploids ABA and ACA as compared to the trigenomic haploids ABC. The studies also concluded that, whatsoever the source or origin of genome A was, it has retained chromosomal homology resulting frequently into the autosyndetic bivalents in the digenomic triploids...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{hybridization}} between species, under either natural or artificial conditions, provides information of value {{for a variety}} of reasons. In general, it may be expected that the incidence of crossbreeding between populations existing under natural conditions will be related to their nearness of relationship, and information of taxonomic interest may be obtained from such study. Furthermore, the relative survival and fertility of the resulting hybrids should provide an indication of the degree of genetic difference between the parental types, and thus genetic information may be available through experimental hybridization studies. Hybrids provide favorable material for studying the <b>chromosomal</b> numbers and <b>configurations</b> among related species, and when they are fertile the degree of phenotypic variation in second or backcross generations may be used to estimate genetic differences controlling specific traits. Finally, {{the presence or absence of}} natural hybridization between closely related forms occurring in the same habitats may provide a clue as to the degree of niche overlap and interspecies competition for habitat resources. Therefore, if the basis for periodic or local hybridization between two forms that normally do not hybridize can be established, the ecological differences that normally prevent hybridization may possibly be deduced. For various reasons, the grouse and quails of North America exhibit a rather surprisingly high tendency to hybridize, even among species belonging to seemingly different genera. Peterle (1951) reviewed the cases of intergeneric hybrids reported in gallinaceous birds, and Cockrum (1952) provided a more complete survey of hybridization in North American birds. Sibley (1957) commented on the taxonomic significance of hybridization in grouse, and a similar review of the significance of hybridization in the New World quails is available (Johnsgard, 1970).

40|$|Crosses between barley (Hordeum vulgare) and bulbous barleygrass (H. bulbosum) {{could be}} {{valuable}} {{for the transfer}} of such properties as resistance to cold or diseases from H. bulbosum to H. vulgare. From the literature it was known that difficulties arose in the cross: seed abortion necessitating culture of the hybrid embryo, sterility of the hybrids, and all the viable hybrids mentioned in the literature were triploid. The purpose of my study was to enlarge knowledge of these interspecific crosses, and to try and solve the difficulties. For convenience parents and hybrids were denoted by genome symbols, e. g. VV = H. vulgare (2 x), BB = H. bulbosum (2 x). The results below are arranged as in the chapters. Crossing and the hybrids All eight possible crosses between diploid and autotetraploid cytotypes of the two species were tried. The direction of the cross, the parents and environmental conditions seemed to influence its success. Both crosses between VV and BB yielded three haploid plants with the genome V and six diploid hybrids. The haploids {{and two of the}} hybrids died before flowering. The cross VV x BBBB was most successful: one haploid plant with the genome V and 145 triploid hybrids, of which 13 died before flowering. The reciprocal cross yielded 12 triploid hybrids. Both crosses between VVVV and BB were unsuccessful, whereas the two crosses between VVVV and BBBB produced 18 dihaploids with the genome VV and 16 plants with more than 14 chromosomes and hybrid characteristics. Of the dihaploids nine died before flowering and of the hybrids six (tables 2 to 6). All the hybrids resembled one another and were almost sterile (tables 7 and 8). Their general form was that of H. bulbosum, although they were not so large and vigorous. Chromosome number was usually unstable in the tetraploid hybrids; from one of them a diploid hybrid arose, presumably by gradual elimination of chromosomes, while six of the plants formed tillers, usually fertile, resembling H. vulgare. The progeny of these tillers were diploid {{with the exception of one}} which yielded diploid and tetraploid plants, presumably by spontaneous doubling up of the chromosomes. The dihaploid plants closely resembled diploid H. vulgare and were fertile. They and the haploid must have arisen by elimination of chromosomes. Later generations from dihaploids and from fertile tillers of tetraploid hybrids were compared with H. vulgare. Progeny with cytoplasm of H. vulgare (from the cross VVVV x BBBB) differed slightly from diploid H. vulgare, probably because the genetic constitution of the two sets of chromosomes derived from the tetraploid is no longer identical with that of the diploid variety of barley. Offspring of dihaploids with the cytoplasm of H. bulbosum (from the cross BBBB x VVVV differed more because there would be a cytoplasmic effect as well as the genetic effect (table 9). Embryology Development of the caryopsis from the crosses VV x BB, VV x BB 13 B and VVVV x BBBB was compared with intravarietal fertilization VV x VV. All parts of the caryopsis developed slower in interspecific crosses. Seed of the crosses VV x BB and VVVV x BBBB usually aborted within two weeks of pollination before any organs of the embryo had differentiated. Seed of VV x BBBB aborted within three or four weeks after organs of the embryo had started differentiating abnormally. From early in development all interspecific crosses showed abnormalities in division of cells and nuclei in the endosperm. Besides many micronuclei, there were multinuclear cells and giant nuclei which arose by endomitosis or by nuclear fusion in the multinuclear cells followed by endomitosis. The abnormal endosperm degenerated, thus appearing to be the primary cause of seed abortion. In the hybrid embryo abnormalities were detected, from which micronuclei arose. They appeared later than in the endosperm and seemed not to be the direct cause of abortion of the embryo, even though they affect its vitality. In the hybrid crosses the antipodal cells remained intact slightly longer than in the intravarietal cross and occasionally some cells remained intact much longer, giving rise to enormous giant nuclei, perhaps by endomitosis. The maternal tissue in the hybrid crosses developed initially as in the intravarietal cross but more slowly. Seed abortion certainly curtailed this early. Cytogenetics The karyotypes of parental species, hybrids and various other progeny were described and compared, to see whether there was any change in chromosomal morphology and to find the chromosomal composition of plants after vegetative elimination of chromosomes. Amphiplasty occurred in the hybrid so that satellites of the H. bulbosum genome were not visible as such. The relative lengths of the chromosomes within a genome were not affected by hybridization and the ratio of lengths between the genomes of H. vulgare and H. bulbosum were about the same in all hybrids. The karyotypes obtained by vegetative elimination of chromosomes were entirely as expected (tables 12 to 22). The maximum number of nucleoli per cell of vegetative tissue corresponded with the number of satellite chromosomes except in some cells of triploid hybrids. The average number of nucleoli per cell was in diploids and triploids much larger and in tetraploids slightly larger than expected from the number in H. vulgare. Thus the presence of chromosomes of H. bulbosum increased the number of nucleoli per cel (table 23 and figure 26). In all types of hybrid, chromosomes paired completely or almost completely during the pachytene stage of meiosis, by which allosyndetic, non-homologous autosyndetic and homologous autosyndetic pairing occurred simultaneously. Then some associations of chromosomes fell apart by desynapsis which was a result of low chiasma frequency. The other chromosomes remained joined by chiasmata or pseudochiasmata, which could hardly be distinguished from each other. In diploid hybrids most seemed to be pseudochiasmata and they sometimes lasted until the first anaphase. In the triploids most normal chiasmata gave rise to association of chromosomes in the first metaphase, while in tetraploids both types occurred together but with fewer pseudochiasmata than normal chiasmata (tables 24, 25, 28, 29, and 31). In all types of hybrid there were one or rarely two nucleoli per cell during prophase and diakinesis of meiosis. The nucleolus was associated with two chromosomes or <b>chromosomal</b> <b>configurations</b> at most. In diploids and tetraploids and to a lesser extent in triploids there were aneuploid cells, chiefly hypoploid. Many cells contained various inclusions; hypoploid cells contained the most. The inclusions and the aneuploidy could be ascribed to abnormal premeiotic division in which not all the chromosomes were distributed between the daughter cells (tables 26 and 32). Association of chromosomes was studied in the first metaphase of aneuploid cells. In diploid hybrids, association decreased rapidly in hypoploid cells with declining chromosome number. In triploid hybrids this decrease was less marked and in cells with about 14 chromosomes association reached the rate found in the diploid hybrids, suggesting that it was chiefly the chromosomes of H. bulbosum which had been eliminated. In tetraploid hybrids association decreased rapidly until chromosome number reached 24 and then decreased slower slightly above the rate of association found in aneuploid cells of triploids. This indicates that there is some selectivity in the elimination of chromosomes, whereby the chromosomes of H. bulbosum stand more chance of being eliminated (figure 33). Because of univalents, pseudochiasmata and aneuploidy, meiosis was very irregular from the first metaphase. The tetrads contained micronuclei and pollen micrograins. Ripe anthers of diploid hybrids contained no stainable grains; triploids contained little stainable grains and they were of variable diameter; in tetraploids there was a proportion of stainable grains which varied between plants and grain diameter was very variable (tables 27, 30 and 34). In the haploid plant with the genome V there was a slight tendency to form bivalents in meiosis, but they mostly proved to be pseudobivalents. Dihaploids with the genome VV all had very regular meiosis similar to that of diploid H. vulgare. The pollen of these plants was identical with that of diploid H. vul gare (tables 33 and 34). Discussion Many of the abnormalities seem to be caused by faulty division of nuclei containing chromosomes from both H. vulgare and H. bulbosum. They included the abnormal development of endosperm, lack of vigour in the hybrid embryo and plant, vegetative elimination of chromosomes, and- the occurrence of aneuploid pollen mother cells. The abnormalities could be the result of incompatibility between chromosomes or genes of the parental species. The observed differences in the amount and nature of abnormalities in several tissues probably ensue from existing differences between the tissues, e. g. in speed of mitoses, and by differences in gene dosage. Another abnormality in the hybrid nucleus is amphiplasty, which was expressed as the suppression of the secondary constriction in the satellite chromosome of H. bulbosum and probably caused the suppression of nucleolus activity in the same chromosome. This abnormality is perhaps associated with the preferential elimination of the chromosomes of H. bulbosum. Finally there are abnormalities in meiosis: besides aneuploidy, there are desynapsis as a result of low chiasma frequency and formation of pseudochiasmata. The low chiasma frequency probably is genetically determined, while the pseudochiasmata might be the result of matrix connections or fusion of heterochromatin. The significance of the hybrids for barley breeding is briefly considered. As it is likely that in meiosis material is exchanged between chromosomes of the two parents and as the hybrids are not completely sterile, it may be possible to introduce characteristics of H. bulbosum into H. vulgare. In somatic tissue characteristics could be transferred by induction of interspecific translocations, for example in tetraploid hybrids, after which the preferential elimination of chromosomes could be used to recover changed genomes of H. vulgare. Perhaps hexaploid hybrids VVBBBB could be used. Plants with the cytoplasm of H. bulbosum and the chromosomes of H. vulgare could be of interest for breeding frost-resistant barley and in the study of male-sterile barley. The possibilities deserve further research...|$|R
