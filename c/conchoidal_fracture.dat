5|$|Indigenous {{people of}} the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes have {{inhabited}} the area for hundreds of years. In pre-contact times, these people lived a nomadic lifestyle. They did not build permanent structures in which to live, as they moved from region to region to find food and resources. Animals such as caribou, martin, moose and caribou were hunted and trapped by the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes. In summer, these people gathered roots, plants and a volcanic glass called obsidian. Anahim obsidian was traded widely throughout the Interior {{and up and down}} the Coast from the community of Bella Coola. Arrowheads and knives were made from obsidian because when it breaks with a characteristic <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracture,</b> it creates very sharp edges. A modified form of this lifestyle is practiced by some indigenous people to this day.|$|E
25|$|It is a dense substance, with a {{specific}} gravity between 5.6 and 6.0 — at least 1.6 times that of diamond. Cubic zirconia is relatively hard, 8–8.5 on the Mohs scale— slightly harder than most semi-precious natural gems. Its refractive index is high at 2.15–2.18 (compared to 2.42 for diamonds) and its luster is adamantine. Its dispersion is very high at 0.058–0.066, exceeding that of diamond (0.044). Cubic zirconia has no cleavage and exhibits a <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracture.</b> Because of its high hardness, it is generally considered brittle.|$|E
25|$|When {{a mineral}} is broken in a {{direction}} that does not correspond to a plane of cleavage, it is termed to have been fractured. There are several types of uneven fracture. The classic example is <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracture,</b> like that of quartz; rounded surfaces are created, which are marked by smooth curved lines. This type of fracture occurs only in very homogeneous minerals. Other types of fracture are fibrous, splintery, and hackly. The latter describes a break along a rough, jagged surface; an example of this property is found in native copper.|$|E
40|$|Heavy steel {{castings}} deoxidized with aluminium are sometimes brittle intercrystalline failed during their service along primary grain boundaries what is initiated by aluminium nitrides and so called <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fractures</b> are formed. The tendency to forming the <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fractures</b> depends in particular on cooling rate (the casting modulus), aluminium and nitrogen contents in steel. During deoxidation, when manufacturing heavy castings, the elements with high affinity to nitrogen, zirconium or titanium, {{are added to}} steel that would decrease nitrogen activity by the bond on stable nitrides. The formation of stable nitrides should reduce the tendency of steel {{to the formation of}} <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fractures.</b> Deoxidation was thermodynamically analyzed at presence of the mentioned elements. For particular conditions a probable course of deoxidation was estimated at test castings. The deoxidation course was checked by microanalysis of deoxidation products (inclusions). For service and experimental castings the anticipated composition of inclusions was compared. It has been proved that in heavy castings with high aluminium contents in steel under studied conditions neither the addition of zirconium nor of titanium nor of rare earth metals will prevent the formation of <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fractures...</b>|$|R
50|$|In lithic stone tools, <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fractures</b> {{form the}} basis of flint knapping, since the shape of the broken surface is {{controlled}} only by the stresses applied, and not by some preferred orientation of the material. This property also makes such fractures useful in engineering, since they provide a permanent record of the stress state at the time of failure. As <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fractures</b> can be produced only by mechanical impact, rather than frost cracking for example, they can be a useful method of differentiating prehistoric stone tools from natural stones.|$|R
50|$|<b>Conchoidal</b> <b>fractures</b> {{can also}} occur in other {{materials}} under favorable circumstances. This material property was {{widely used in}} the Stone Age to make sharp tools, and minerals that fractured in this fashion were widely traded as a desirable raw material.|$|R
25|$|As {{early as}} 10,000 years ago, the Tahltan people, who {{now live in}} Dease Lake, Telegraph Creek and the Iskut, used {{obsidian}} from Mount Edziza to make tools and weapons for trading material. This is {{the main source of}} obsidian found in northwestern British Columbia, which was traded as far away as Alaska and northern Alberta. Obsidian is a type of naturally occurring glass that is highly valued for its cutting qualities. Like all glass and some other types of naturally occurring rocks, obsidian breaks with a characteristic <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracture,</b> creating razor sharp edges.|$|E
25|$|Experiments in knapping have {{demonstrated}} the relative ease with which a hand axe can be made, which could help explain their success. In addition, they demand relatively little maintenance and allow a choice of raw materials–any rock will suffice that supports a <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracture.</b> It is easy to improvise their manufacture and correct mistakes without requiring detailed planning. No long or demanding apprenticeship is necessary to learn the necessary techniques. These factors combine to allow these objects to remain in use throughout pre-history. Their adaptability makes them effective {{in a variety of}} tasks, from heavy duty such as digging in soil, felling trees or breaking bones to delicate such as cutting ligaments, slicing meat or perforating a variety of materials.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} archaeological {{evidence}} of usage was in Kariandusi and other sites of the Acheulian age (beginning 1.5 million years BP) dated 700,000 BC, {{although the number of}} objects found at these sites were very low relative to the Neolithic. Use of obsidian in pottery of the Neolithic in the area around Lipari was found to be significantly less at a distance representing two weeks journeying. Anatolian sources of obsidian are known to have been the material used in the Levant and modern-day Iraqi Kurdistan from a time beginning sometime about 12,500 BC. The first attested civilized use is dated to the late fifth millennium BC, known from excavations at Tell Brak. Obsidian was valued in Stone Age cultures because, like flint, it could be fractured to produce sharp blades or arrowheads. Like all glass and some other types of naturally occurring rocks, obsidian breaks with a characteristic <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracture.</b> It was also polished to create early mirrors. Modern archaeologists have developed a relative dating system, obsidian hydration dating, to calculate the age of obsidian artifacts.|$|E
5000|$|Due to its glassy {{internal}} structure, obsidian {{is relatively}} easy to work, as it breaks in very predictable and controlled ways via <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracturing.</b> This contributed to its prolific use throughout Mesoamerica. It is obtained by either quarrying source sites or in nodule form from riverbeds or fractured outcrops.|$|R
50|$|These raw {{materials}} all have common characteristics which make them ideal for stone tool production. To make a stone material ideal for tool production, {{it must be}} non-crystalline or glassy, which allows for <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracturing.</b> These characteristics allow the person forming the stone ("flintknapper") to control the reduction precisely {{in order to make}} a wide variety of tools.|$|R
50|$|Hidalgoite is {{categorized}} {{under the}} trigonal crystal system and Rm space group {{and can be}} denoted by the H-M symbol (2/m). Physical properties of hidalgoite include its gray white to light gray color, a white streak, specific gravity of 3.96 and a hardness of 4.5. Hidalgoite specimens are usually translucent to sub opaque, and the brittle nature of mineral produces <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fractures.</b> It has an earthy luster.|$|R
500|$|As {{early as}} 10,000 years ago, the Tahltan First Nations people, who {{now live in}} Dease Lake, Telegraph Creek and the Iskut, used {{obsidian}} from the Mount Edziza volcanic complex to make tools and weapons for trading material. Most of the obsidian occurs at relatively high elevations at about [...] This is {{the main source of}} obsidian found in northwestern British Columbia, which was traded as far away as Alaska and northern Alberta. Obsidian is a type of naturally occurring glass that is highly valued for its cutting qualities and is produced by the rapid cooling of lava. Like all glass and some other types of naturally occurring rocks, obsidian breaks with a characteristic <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracture,</b> creating razor sharp edges. A knife made of Edziza obsidian, [...] possibly 2,000 years old, has been recovered in the Stikine River area. Two exposed columnar basalt formations exist within the volcanic complex: the Tahltan Eagle at the meeting of the Tahltan and Stikine rivers, and Pipe Organ Mountain. The Tahltan Eagle has significant spiritual and cultural importance to the Tahltan people, while the correct name and cultural significance of Pipe Organ Mountain to the Tahltan people is unknown.|$|E
60|$|Climbing the Rastrojito slopes, we sighted the Pedras Negras: {{these are}} huge {{travelled}} rocks of basalt, jet-black, breaking with a <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracture,</b> and showing debris like onion-coats about their base. The aspect was fantastic, resembling {{nothing so much}} as skulls 10 to 15 feet high. They are doubtless the produce of the upper slopes, which by slow degrees gravitated to the present pumice-beds.|$|E
60|$|The {{ridge of}} Pequenes, which divides the waters {{flowing into the}} Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, extends in a nearly N.N.W. and S.S.E. line; its strata dip eastward at an angle of between 30 and 45 degrees, but in the higher peaks bending up and {{becoming}} almost vertical. Where the road crosses this range, the height is 13,210 feet above the sea-level, and I estimated the neighbouring pinnacles at from fourteen to fifteen thousand feet. The lowest stratum visible in this ridge is a red stratified sandstone [P]; on it are superimposed two great masses [Q and S] of black, hard, compact, even having a <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracture,</b> calcareous, more or less laminated shale, passing into limestone: this rock contains organic remains, presently to be enumerated. The compacter varieties fuse easily in a white glass; and this I may add is a very general character with all the sedimentary beds in the Cordillera: although this rock when broken is generally quite black, it everywhere weathers into an ash-grey tint. Between these two great masses [Q and S], a bed [R] of gypsum is interposed, about three hundred feet in thickness, and having the same characters as heretofore described. I estimated the total thickness of these three beds [Q, R, S] at nearly three thousand feet; and to this must be added, as will be immediately seen, a great overlying mass of red sandstone.|$|E
50|$|Removed flakes exhibit {{features}} {{characteristic of}} <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracturing,</b> including striking platforms, bulbs of force, and occasionally eraillures (small secondary flakes {{detached from the}} flake's bulb of force). Flakes are often quite sharp, with distal edges only a few molecules thick {{when they have a}} feather termination. These flakes can be used directly as tools or modified into other utilitarian implements, such as spokeshaves and scrapers.|$|R
25|$|Some hand axes {{were formed}} {{with a hard}} hammer and {{finished}} with a soft hammer. Blows that result in deep <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fractures</b> (the first phase of manufacture) can be distinguished from features resulting from sharpening with a soft hammer. The latter leaves shallower, more distended, broader scars sometimes with small, multiple shock waves. However, marks left a small hard hammer can leave similar marks to a soft hammer.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Conchoidal</b> <b>fractures</b> often {{result in}} a curved {{breakage}} surface that resembles the rippling, gradual curves of a mussel shell; the word [...] "conchoid" [...] {{is derived from the}} word for this animal (Greek konche). A swelling appears at the point of impact called the bulb of percussion. Shock waves emanating outwards from this point leave their mark on the stone as ripples. Other conchoidal features include small fissures emanating from the bulb of percussion.|$|R
60|$|Sixthly: a {{volcanic}} stratum, 250 feet in thickness, of so varying a nature that I {{do not believe}} a score of specimens would show all the varieties; much is highly amygdaloidal, much compact; there are greenish, blackish, purplish, and grey varieties, rarely including crystals of green augite and minute acicular ones of feldspar, but often crystals and amygdaloidal masses of white, red, and black carbonate of lime. Some of the blackish varieties of this rock have a <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracture</b> and resemble basalt; others have an irregular fracture. Some of the grey and purplish varieties are thickly speckled with green earth and with white crystalline carbonate of lime; others are largely amygdaloidal with green earth and calcareous spar. Again, other earthy varieties, of greenish, purplish and grey tints, contain much iron, and are almost half composed of amygdaloidal balls of dark brown bole, of a whitish indurated feldspathic matter, of bright green earth, of agate, and {{of black and white}} crystallised carbonate of lime. All these varieties are easily fusible. Viewed from a distance, the line of junction with the underlying semi-porcellanic strata was distinct; but when examined closely, it was impossible to point out within a foot where the lava ended and where the sedimentary mass began: the rock at the time of junction was in most places hard, of a bright green colour, and abounded with irregular amygdaloidal masses of ferruginous and pure calcareous spar, and of agate.|$|E
60|$|The {{passage of}} the {{foregoing}} beds into the strata of glassy obsidian is effected in several ways: first, angulo-modular masses of obsidian, both large and small, abruptly appear disseminated in a slaty, or in an amorphous, pale-coloured, feldspathic rock, with a somewhat pearly fracture. Secondly, small irregular nodules of the obsidian, either standing separately, or united into thin layers, seldom more than the tenth of an inch in thickness, alternate repeatedly with very thin layers of a feldspathic rock, which is striped with the finest parallel zones of colour, like an agate, and which sometimes passes {{into the nature of}} pitchstone; the interstices between the nodules of obsidian are generally filled by soft white matter, resembling pumiceous ashes. Thirdly, the whole substance of the bounding rock suddenly passes into an angulo-concretionary mass of obsidian. Such masses (as well as the small nodules) of obsidian are of a pale green colour, and are generally streaked with different shades of colour, parallel to the laminae of the surrounding rock; they likewise generally contain minute white sphaerulites, of which half is sometimes embedded in a zone of one shade of colour, and half in a zone of another shade. The obsidian assumes its jet black colour and perfectly <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracture,</b> only when in large masses; but even in these, on careful examination and on holding the specimens in different lights, I could generally distinguish parallel streaks of different shades of darkness.|$|E
60|$|At Port Desire {{there is}} an {{extensive}} formation of the claystone porphyry, stretching at least twenty-five miles into the interior: it has been denuded and deeply worn into gullies before being covered up by the tertiary deposits, through which it here and there projects in hills; those north of the bay being 440 feet in height. The strata have in several places been tilted at small angles, generally either to N.N.W. or S.S.E. By gradual passages and alternations, the porphyries change incessantly in nature. I will describe {{only some of the}} principal mineralogical changes, which are highly instructive, and which I carefully examined. The prevailing rock has a compact purplish base, with crystals of earthy or opaque feldspar, and often with grains of quartz. There are other varieties, with an almost truly trachytic base, full of little angular vesicles and crystals of glassy feldspar; and there are beds of black perfect pitchstone, as well as of a concretionary imperfect variety. On a casual inspection, the whole series would be thought to be of the same plutonic or volcanic nature with the trachytic varieties and pitchstone; but this is far from being the case, as much of the porphyry is certainly of metamorphic origin. Besides the true porphyries, there are many beds of earthy, quite white or yellowish, friable, easily fusible matter, resembling chalk, which under the microscope is seen to consist of minute broken crystals, and which, as remarked in a former chapter, singularly resembles the upper tufaceous beds of the Patagonian tertiary formation. This earthy substance often becomes coarser, and contains minute rounded fragments of porphyries and rounded grains of quartz, and in one case so many of the latter as to resemble a common sandstone. These beds are sometimes marked with true lines of aqueous deposition, separating particles of different degrees of coarseness; in other cases there are parallel ferruginous lines not of true deposition, as shown by the arrangement of the particles, though singularly resembling them. The more indurated varieties often include many small and some larger angular cavities, which appear due to the removal of earthy matter: some varieties contain mica. All these earthy and generally white stones insensibly pass into more indurated sonorous varieties, breaking with a <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracture,</b> yet of small specific gravity; many of these latter varieties assume a pale purple tint, being singularly banded and veined with different shades, and often become plainly porphyritic with crystals of feldspar. The formation of these crystals could be most clearly traced by minute angular and often partially hollow patches of earthy matter, first assuming a FIBROUS STRUCTURE, then passing into opaque imperfectly shaped crystals, and lastly, into perfect glassy crystals. When these crystals have appeared, and when the basis has become compact, the rock in many places could not be distinguished from a true claystone porphyry without a trace of mechanical structure.|$|E
5000|$|This {{can take}} two forms. The first type of lapping (traditionally called grinding), {{involves}} rubbing a brittle material such as glass against a surface such as iron or glass itself (also {{known as the}} [...] "lap" [...] or grinding tool) with an abrasive such as aluminum oxide, jeweller's rouge, optician's rouge, emery, silicon carbide, diamond, etc., between them. This produces microscopic <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fractures</b> as the abrasive rolls about between the two surfaces and removes material from both.|$|R
5000|$|Knapping is {{the shaping}} of flint, chert, {{obsidian}} or other <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracturing</b> stone {{through the process of}} lithic reduction to manufacture stone tools, strikers for flintlock firearms, or to produce flat-faced stones for building or facing walls, and flushwork decoration. The original Germanic term [...] "knopp" [...] meant strike, shape, or work, so it could theoretically have referred equally well to making a statue or dice. Modern usage is more specific, referring almost exclusively to the hand-tool pressure-flaking process pictured.|$|R
50|$|Canfieldite {{is a rare}} silver tin sulfide mineral with formula: Ag8SnS6. The mineral {{typically}} contains variable {{amounts of}} germanium substitution in the tin site and tellurium in the sulfur site. There is a complete series between canfieldite and its germanium analogue, argyrodite. It forms black orthorhombic crystals which often appear to be cubic in form due to twinning. The most typical form is as botryoidal rounded grape-like masses. Its Mohs hardness is 2.5 and the specific gravity is 6.28. Canfieldite exhibits <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracturing</b> and no cleavage.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Conchoidal</b> <b>fracture</b> {{breakage}} {{that resembles}} the concentric ripples of a mussel shell. It often occurs in amorphous or fine-grained minerals such as flint, opal or obsidian, {{but may also}} occur in crystalline minerals such as quartz. Subconchoidal fracture is similar to <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracture,</b> but with less significant curvature. (Note that obsidian is an igneous rock, not a mineral, but it does illustrate <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracture</b> well.) ...|$|E

50|$|Sperrylite is a tin-white mineral {{known for}} its {{brilliant}} metallic luster, with a grey to black streak. It has indistinct cleavage on {001} and a <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracture</b> and is brittle. Its hardness is between 6 and 7, and it is quite dense with a calculated specific gravity of 10.78. It has an isometric crystal system, <b>Conchoidal</b> <b>fracture,</b> non-magnetic and non-radioactive.|$|E
40|$|In the Jerez-Lebríja area (SW Spain) {{there are}} deppsits of Pliocene sands which are {{exploited}} in various quarries. The {{analysis of the}} surface features presented by the quartz grains from these sands refveals different stages in their evolution of the grains. The first of these stages is recorded {{in the form of}} <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fractures</b> and arcuate steps; the second is represented by an assemblage of features comprising isolated Vs, grooves and chattermark trails. In a posterior stage chemical features were developed in relation to tropic climatic Condition...|$|R
30|$|Other surface features: On the {{surfaces}} of both Itokawa particles, we also observed fracturing, abrasion-like features, and blisters (Fig.  2). Olivine on the host grain shows common <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracturing</b> (Figs.  1 a and 2 d). One abrasion-like feature was identified {{on the surface of}} Mizuki at the base of an adhering particle of Ca-phosphate (1.1 [*]×[*] 2.4  μm in size, Figs.  2 c and 4 d). The underlying albite is harder than the Ca-phosphate, so it is likely that this feature formed when the Ca-phosphate was partially molten (likely ejecta from a micrometeoroid impact), and left trails of melt behind as it landed on the plagioclase and slid to a stop.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{stone tools}} in {{the life span of}} the genus Homo are Mode 1 tools, and come from what has been termed the Oldowan Industry, named after the type of site (many sites, actually) found in Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, where they were discovered in large quantities. Oldowan tools were characterised by their simple construction, predominantly using core forms. These cores were river pebbles, or rocks similar to them, that had been struck by a spherical hammerstone to cause <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fractures</b> removing flakes from one surface, creating an edge and often a sharp tip. The blunt end is the proximal surface; the sharp, the distal. Oldowan is a percussion technology. Grasping the proximal surface, the hominid brought the distal surface down hard on an object he wished to detach or shatter, such as a bone or tuber.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} forms of chalcedony, {{chrysoprase}} has a hardness of 6-7 on the Mohs hardness scale and a <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracture</b> like flint.|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs as}} black incrustations, dark to pale-brown in thin section. It has a grayish-black streak. It has a brittle to <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracture.</b> The {{hardness}} of coffinite is between 5 and 6.|$|E
50|$|It {{is the use}} of hard-hammer {{percussion}} {{that most}} often results {{in the formation of the}} typical features of <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fracture</b> on the detached flake, such as the bulb of percussion and compression rings.|$|E
50|$|Cryptocrystalline or {{amorphous}} stone such as chert, flint, obsidian, and chalcedony, as well {{as other}} fine-grained stone material, such as rhyolite, felsite, and quartzite, were used as a source material for producing stone tools. As these materials lack natural planes of separation, <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fractures</b> occur when they are struck with sufficient force. The propagation of force through the material {{takes the form of a}} Hertzian cone that originates from the point of impact and results in the separation of material from the objective piece, usually in the form of a partial cone, commonly known as a lithic flake. This process is predictable, and allows the flintknapper to control and direct the application of force so as to shape the material being worked. Controlled experiments may be performed using glass cores and consistent applied force in order to determine how varying factors affect core reduction.|$|R
40|$|Flint is a lithic {{material}} {{that can be}} worked to obtain sharp blades with <b>conchoidal</b> <b>fractures</b> characteristic of lithic tools as scrapers, hand axes and arrowheads. These artefacts represent {{the majority of the}} lithic material from the Palaeolithic sites worldwide, and it continued to be used during subsequent periods to manufacture some of the earliest tools used by man. One of the questions that archaeologists are keen to answer in relation to flint use and characterization is sourcing. Answering this question is important to reconstruct interaction networks of prehistoric cultures. Over the past years, a great variety of analytical methods have been applied to identify the sources of flint artefacts found in different archaeological contexts. [1 8] The objective of these studies is to determine the chemical composition of geological and archaeological flint samples and to obtain element correspondences to establish the probable geological source of origin for archaeological artefacts...|$|R
50|$|Two stone {{characteristics}} {{will determine}} whether one is able to chip away big enough flakes to make tools out of: whether the stone is of a cryptocrystalline structure, and how conchoidally the stone fractures. A cryptocrystalline stone {{is one that is}} made up of minute crystals that can only be seen with a microscope. <b>Conchoidal</b> <b>fractures</b> are described as smooth, curved breaks from the base stone. Stones that have both of these characteristics allow for flakes that are big and sharp enough for a variety of tools to be made. Obsidian is a great example of a material that is perfect for making tools with, as it is both cryptocrystalline and it fractures conchoidally. Many early Middle Eastern and American civilizations used obsidian as a basis for tools as its internal structure made it easier to chip away than most of the other stones in the area.|$|R
