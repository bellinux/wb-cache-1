Before the release the song was remixed by Sadkin at RAK Studios, in London. About the process Bailey commented: [...] "You know what a great producer is? It's someone who takes great ideas and makes them into good records. In our field, great music is a hit record." [...] The song became the Thompson Twins' biggest hit in America, {{but at the same time}} it pressured the band to produce top-selling music, even if they were not completely <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> as Alannah Currie stated in an interview with David Oriard of The Spokesman-Review: ...|$|E
500|$|To avoid over-hyping the album, DGC Records took {{a low-key}} {{approach}} to promoting In Utero; the company's {{head of marketing}} told Billboard before the album's release that the label was taking a promotional strategy {{similar to that of}} Nevermind, and explained that the label would [...] "set things up, duck, {{and get out of the}} way". [...] The label aimed its promotion at alternative markets and press, and released the album on vinyl record as part of this strategy. [...] In contrast to the previous album, the label did not release any of In Uteros singles commercially in the United States. [...] DGC sent promo copies of the album's first single, [...] "Heart-Shaped Box", to American college, modern rock, and album-oriented rock radio stations in early September, but the label did not target Top 40 radio. [...] Despite the label's promotion, the band was convinced that In Utero would not be as successful as Nevermind. [...] Cobain told Jim DeRogatis, [...] "We're certain that we won't sell a quarter as much, and we're totally <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> because we like this record so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Piller was {{disappointed}} with the following Ro episode, [...] "", as it {{put her in the}} position of disbelieving Counselor Deanna Troi without having had the weight of [...] "victories" [...] in the past to convince the viewer of the power of her convictions. But he enjoyed her sudden relationship with Commander William Riker in [...] "". Forbes shared the view of that episode, later saying [...] "When you have amnesia, you wonder if that brings out a side of you that's always wanted to come out. Would you really be <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>that?</b> It's an interesting thing. I had a really good time with that episode." [...] Later in the season, [...] "The Next Phase" [...] was written with the idea of being a vehicle for Geordi La Forge and Troi, but it was decided to include Ro instead as one of the lead characters. Ro had been included as one of three lead characters in Morgan Gendel's original pitch for the episode [...] "". This would have seen her in a love triangle with Picard and Riker. Instead, the concept was redeveloped to focus solely on Picard.|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Alex Henderson awarded the album 3 stars, stating: [...] "Europe is {{essentially}} a straight-ahead hard bop/post-bop date, and yet, it isn't necessarily an album that jazz purists will be <b>comfortable</b> <b>with.</b> <b>That's</b> because Motian doesn't stick {{to the type of}} all-acoustic format that purists expect... Europe is a solid effort that will please those who admire Motian's flexibility and open-mindedness".|$|R

2500|$|The Plymouth Brethren is a conservative, Evangelical, restorationist {{movement}} whose origin can {{be traced}} to Dublin, Ireland, in 1827.

500|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} Barbara Gordon is her sense of morality, which {{differs from that of}} Batman and her primary field agent Black Canary. She has demonstrated a willingness to use lethal force, such as in Chuck Dixon's Birds of Prey issue #10, [...] "State of War", which contradicts the methodology used by her closest allies and most DC Comics characters. Dixon stated an interview that [...] "he's less morally conflicted than other characters. She's very 'means to an end' oriented. She sees that sometimes you have to kill to save lives. She's not <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> but accepts it. She would do anything to avoid using deadly force but, when push comes to shove, she'll drop the hammer." [...] She demonstrates a similar moral ambiguity in Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Of Like Minds when she argues with Black Canary over using illegally obtained information, which denies criminals the right of due process. Although the Huntress has never been opposed to using lethal force, she also comes into conflict with Oracle over the fact that she will use the psychological impact of a mission to subconsciously manipulate her field agents into conforming to her ideology.|$|E

[...] "I always {{wanted to live in}} New York City, so that was a dream come true!" [...] She added that [...] "New York has so much culture" [...] and she had been able to grow as a person and actor. [...] "It's good that you can be given a script and learn 40 pages and feel <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> You get to know so much about the character that you don't question things, you just do it instantaneously," [...] she said.|$|E

While talking to reporters in South Carolina, Thompson said, [...] "I attend church when I'm in Tennessee. I'm [...] in McLean right now. I don't attend {{regularly}} when I'm up there." [...] On occasion, Thompson attended Vienna Presbyterian Church in Vienna, Virginia. He did not speak much about his religion during his campaign, saying, [...] "Me getting up and talking about what a wonderful person I am and that sort of thing, I'm not <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> and I don't think it does me any good." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{band was}} {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 14, 2012 by actor/comedian Chris Rock, who is a longtime friend and fan of the band. The induction lineup was Kiedis, Flea, Smith, Klinghoffer, Frusciante, Slovak (who was represented by his brother James), Irons and Martinez. Frusciante did not attend the ceremony. Smith said [...] "We asked him, he said, 'I'm just not really <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> but good luck and thanks for inviting me.' He's the kind of guy, I think, that once he's finished with something he's just on to the next phase of his life. The Chili Peppers are not really on his radar right now." [...] Despite recording one album with the band, Dave Navarro and Jack Sherman were the only two former recording band members not inducted. Kiedis explained that Navarro, who appeared to be fine with not being included, was better suited for induction as a member of Jane's Addiction, the band he was best known for. Sherman on the other hand was angry about not being included and spoke out about the band's induction blaming the band for not including him or Navarro by saying he was told only original members, current members and those who played on multiple albums were eligible for induction (although this has proven to not be the case with other inductees). [...] "It appeared to be a politically correct way of omitting Dave Navarro and I for whatever reasons they have that are probably the band's and not the Hall's," [...] Sherman also said [...] "It's really painful to see all this celebrating going on and be excluded. I'm not claiming that I've brought anything other to the band... but to have soldiered on under arduous conditions {{to try to make the}} thing work, and I think that's what you do in a job, looking back. And that's been dishonored. I'm being dishonored, and it sucks." [...] During his induction speech, Smith made sure to thank all of the band members, past and present including Sherman, Navarro along D. H. Peligro (whom he accidentally called H.R. Peligro) and Arik Marshall for the contributions they brought to the band. At 32, Klinghoffer was the youngest artist ever to be inducted into the hall of fame passing Stevie Wonder, who was 38 at the time of his induction. The band performed three songs, including [...] "By the Way", [...] "Give it Away" [...] and [...] "Higher Ground", which included Irons and Martinez on drums. It was the first time Kiedis and Flea had performed with Irons in 24 years and Martinez in 26 years. Near the end of the ceremony, the band was joined by George Clinton, Michael Hampton, Slash, Billie Joe Armstrong, Tre Cool, Ronnie Wood and Kenney Jones for a performance of [...] "Higher Ground".|$|E

50|$|Theory of Motivated Information Management or TMIM, is a social-psychological {{framework}} that examines {{the relationship between}} information management and uncertainty.

In other words, someone may be uncertain about an important issue but decides not to engage or seek information because they are <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> state.|$|E
