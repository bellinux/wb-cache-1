40|$|Pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) {{wood with}} {{dimensions}} (100 x 10 x 10 mm) was thermally treated at 275 degreesC in a muffle oven to impart resistance to microbial degradation. Low-temperature <b>carbonised</b> pine {{resulted in a}} visually homogeneously treated product with a substantial (about 70 % w/w) reduced non-cellulosic carbohydrates content, as compared with untreated pine. These components have been removed or have been partly converted into hydrophobic polymerisation products, which results in reduced water absorption in air of different relative humidity (RH) for <b>carbonised</b> pine. The flexural strength at high RH and after immersion in water of <b>carbonised</b> wood is comparable with untreated and creosote impregnated wood. However, at lower RH the <b>carbonised</b> wood is less strong. Only trace amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other phenolic compounds could be detected both in water leached from <b>carbonised</b> wood and untreated wood. Furans, mainly 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural, have been demonstrated to leach in substantial amounts in the water from <b>carbonised</b> pine. An accelerated decay test in soil showed that low-temperature carbonisation of pine resulted in a product with considerably enhanced durability, as compared with untreated wood. Resistance of <b>carbonised</b> wood against environmental decay was similar or even better than creosote impregnated wood. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{two basic}} mineral {{magnetic}} measurements (mass specific magnetic susceptibility and frequency dependent susceptibility) {{is described in}} the investigation of archaeobotanical taphonomy from nine sites in West Lewis.

Much of the <b>carbonised</b> plant remains recovered from archaeological sites in Britain were most likely <b>carbonised</b> in household fires and subsequently spread across the site by various dispersal mechanisms.

40|$|Chars and <b>carbonised</b> chars were {{produced}} {{from three different}} oxygen-rich precursors (Pinus radiata wood, Phormium tenax leaf fibres, and sucrose crystals). These non-graphitisable carbons were analysed with Raman spectroscopy in order to study the nanostructural development which occurs with increasingly severe heat treatments up to approximately 1000 °C. The thermal reduction of a graphene oxide sample was similarly studied, as this is considered to involve the development of nanometre-scale graphene-like domains within a different oxygen-rich precursor. Increasing the heat treatment temperatures used in the charring and carbonisation processes, led to significant changes {{in a number of}} parameters measured in the Raman spectra. Correlations based on these parameter changes could have future applications in evaluating various char samples and estimating the heat treatment temperatures employed during their manufacture. After production heat treatment temperatures exceeded 700 °C, the Raman spectra of the <b>carbonised</b> chars appeared to be largely precursor independent.

40|$|This study {{involved}} {{the use of}} uncarbonised and <b>carbonised</b> coir in preparing composites of a given polymer. In this case natural rubber (NR) was used. Uncarbonised coir (UC) and <b>carbonised</b> coir (CC) were separately used to prepare the polymer composites. Carbon black (CB) was also used differently and the filler loadings for all varied between 0 and 50 phr.

A comparison of PIII treated, spin-coated PC ﬁlms with pre-treatment thicknesses designed to match and exceed the carbonized layer thickness is employed to study the properties of the <b>carbonised</b> layer independently from the less modiﬁed underlying structure. At ion ﬂuencies higher than 10 16 ions/cm 2, the thinner PC ﬁlm is completely transformed into an amorphous carbon-like material with no traces of the initial PC structure. The thicker ﬁlms, however, incorporated two layers: a top <b>carbonised</b> layer and a cross-linked layer below. Compared to the two-layered PC ﬁlm, the completely carbonized layer was found to have a much higher concentration of C@O bonds and much lower concentration of O-H bonds after exposure to atmospheric oxygen. The refractive index of the thicker PC ﬁlms PIII treated with high ion ﬂuencies is close to the refractive index of diamond-like carbon. Anomalous dispersion of the refractive index of the thicker PC ﬁlms is observed after formation of the <b>carbonised</b> layer. The refractive index of the thinner PC ﬁlm has normal dispersion at all ion ﬂuences. At ion ﬂuences of 2 10 16 ions/cm 2, both PC ﬁlms were found to have the same etching rate as polystyrene. Washing in dichloromethane had no effect on the <b>carbonised</b> layer but affected the underlying material {{in the case of the}} thicker PC ﬁlms leading to a wrinkled structure up to ion ﬂuences of 2 10 16 ions/cm 2.

In view of delays in supply of specialised plant from post-war England, a Humphreys-Glasgow carburetted water-gas plant was installed as an emergency measure by MR Hornibrook Pty Ltd, prior to the winter of 1953. While less efficient than the carbonisation process, this process, one of several known as gasification, used coke as its feedstock and was more easily automated.

40|$|ABSTRACT Six {{hundred and}} ten coke oven {{personnel}} were studied retrospectively {{over a period}} of 11 years (1954 - 65). During this time 82 died, 88 retired and 80 left, but all were traced. The Standard-ised Mortality Ratios (SMRs) have been calculated for four principal causes which have then been further analysed into 30 subgroups. The work was limited because the population was small and the records not detailed enough to analyse the mortality rates according to environmental exposures. Differences between SMRs obtained at the two works were quite marked (73 and 98) and the overall SMR of 85 % was better than expected. The observed number of deaths from respiratory disease, malignant neoplasms and all other causes excluding cardiovascular, was very near that expected, but the numbers of deaths from cardiovascular disease and in particular arteriosclerotic disease, showed a significant deficit.
