Images show (a) two cameras in upper and lower left corner, (b) two cameras in upper left and lower right corner, (c) two cameras in upper left and right <b>corner,</b> (<b>d)</b> three cameras in upper left, lower left and right corner and (e) four cameras, one in each corner. Red color means high accuracy and dark blue means low accuracy. Marker-based optical tracking systems are widely used in augmented reality, medical navigation and industrial applications. We propose {{a model for the}} prediction of the target registration error (TRE) in these kinds of tracking systems by estimating the fiducial location error (FLE) from two-dimensional errors on the image plane and propagating that error to a given point of interest. We have designed a set of experiments in order to estimate the actual parameters of the model for any given tracking system. We present the results of a study which we used to demonstrate the effect of different sources of error. The method is applied to real applications to show the usefulness for any kind of augmented reality system. We also present a set of tools {{that can be used to}} visualize the accuracy at design time...|$|E
30|$|Saliency is {{determined}} by bottom-up features (e.g. color contrast) and top-down factors (e.g. the relevance of color to the task). It guides attention during visual search. Moreover, target saliency can result from similarity relations, e.g. a red bird (target) in front of green leaves (distractors) will be highly salient because the target is dissimilar from the distractor while the distractors are highly similar to each other. In other words, the Guided Search Model (based on saliency) and the Attentional Engagement Theory (based on similarity relations) predict similar results for many search conditions. However, their predictions differ when comparing points b and d of the search continuum (see Fig.  1). Due {{to the fact that}} the Guided Search Model predicts a decreasing search efficiency as more items show the same characteristic in a task-relevant feature (e.g. red fruit in a search for red apples), steeper reaction time slopes are assumed for corner b than for <b>corner</b> <b>d</b> in Fig.  1. The opposite is predicted by Attentional Engagement Theory, according to which search rates increase with decreasing DDS and thus the requirement of the rejection of an increasing number of heterogeneously colored distractor items/groups in the process of visual search. We aim to transfer the knowledge from the above-mentioned basic research to the applied setting of visual search on mobile touch devices and to test the two predictions against each other. Hence, with the help of colored app icons, the predictions of the models were tested for four extreme points (compare corners a, c, b, and d of Fig.  1) of the visual search continuum.|$|E
30|$|Study 1 {{aimed at}} {{transferring}} effects of TDS {{as well as}} DDS to app icons on mobile touch devices. For this purpose, reaction times were analyzed depending on similarity (between colored app icons), set size (number of app icons), and target app presence. As expected, grouping of similar app icons occurred and enabled an efficient app selection. Hence, our results mirror those from basic (laboratory) visual search studies. Regarding the different predictions of the Guided Search Model and the Attentional Engagement Theory, the results support the prediction of the Guided Search Model (compare corner b and d in Fig.  3 to Fig.  1). When the target is highly similar to the distractors (high TDS), the Guided Search Model predicts a weaker guidance of attention by a basic attribute (e.g. color), the more distractors carry this attribute. In the same scenario, the Attentional Engagement Theory predicts more efficient grouping and rejection with increasing distractor similarity (i.e. leading to steeper reaction time slopes for <b>corner</b> <b>d</b> than b in Fig.  1). When realizing point b, we created an extreme variant of high TDS and high DDS in which all icons shared the same color group. Thus, grouping by color could not offer any relevant information for target–distractor discrimination. Thus, the present pattern of results is not fully compatible with the prediction of Attention Engagement Theory. Instead, {{the results suggest that}} priority map models of the search process such as Guided Search are more appropriate to predict search performance in app icon search.|$|E

In this paper we show how the numerical CTMs and CTs can be used, additionally, to extract universal information from their spectra. We provide examples of this for classical and quantum systems, in 1 d, 2 d and 3 d. Our results provide, in particular, practical evidence {{for a wide variety}} of models of the correspondence between d-dimensional quantum and (d+ 1) -dimensional classical spin systems. We show also how corner properties can be used to pinpoint quantum phase transitions, topological or not, without the need for observables. Moreover, for a chiral topological PEPS we show by examples that corner tensors can be used to extract the entanglement spectrum of half a system, with the expected symmetries of the SU(2) _k Wess-Zumino-Witten model describing its gapless edge for k= 1, 2. We also review the theory behind the quantum-classical correspondence for spin systems, and provide a new numerical scheme for quantum state renormalization in 2 d using CTs.

In the same way, define the Z(k, d x d) problem as: given an instance X of M(k, d x d) (the instances of Z(k, d x d) {{are the same as}} those of M(k, d x d)), decide whether at least one matrix in X^+ has a zero in the left-upper <b>corner.</b> Define R(k, <b>d</b> x d) as the variant of Z(k, d x d) where "left-upper corner" is replaced with "right-upper corner".

40|$|The viscoelasticity-induced {{migration}} of a sphere in pressure-driven flow in a square-shaped microchan- nel is investigated under inertialess conditions. The effects of fluid rheology, i. e. of shear thinning and normal stresses, is studied {{by means of}} 3 D finite element simulations. Two constitutive models are selected, in order to highlight differences due to rheological properties. A strong influence of the suspending fluid rheology on the migration phenomenon is shown, by particle trajectory analysis. When the second normal stress difference is negligible and, as a consequence, no sec- ondary flows appear, the particle migrates towards the channel centerline or the closest <b>corner,</b> depend- <b>ing</b> on its initial position. As shear thinning is increased, the center-attractive region is reduced, and the migration rate is faster. On the other hand, the existence of secondary flows, linked {{to the existence of}} a second normal stress difference, alters the migration scenario. The competition between the particle-wall hydrodynamic interactions, promoting the migration mechanism, and the secondary flow velocity com- ponents gives rise to further ‘equilibrium’ positions within the channel cross-section. Particles driven towards such positions trace out a spiral trajectory, following the vortex structure of the secondary flows. However, as the particle dimension is increased or the Deborah number is reduced, the cross-streamline migration velocity overcomes the secondary flow velocity. In this case, most of the particles are driven towards the channel centerline, i. e. a strong flow-focusing effect results...|$|R
40|$|Flat-slab {{construction}} {{has been widely}} used in construction today because of many advantages that it offers. The basic philosophy {{in the design of}} flat slab is to consider only gravity forces; this method ignores the effect of punching shear due to unbalanced moments at the slab column junction which is critical. An attempt has been made to generate generalized design sheets which accounts both punching shear due to gravity loads and unbalanced moments for cases (a) interior column; (b) edge column (bending perpendicular to shorter edge); (c) edge column (bending parallel to shorter edge); (<b>d)</b> <b>corner</b> column. These design sheets are prepared as per codal provisions of IS 456 - 2000. These design sheets will be helpful in calculating the shear reinforcement to be provided at the critical section which is ignored in many design offices. Apart from its usefulness in evaluating punching shear and the necessary shear reinforcement, the design sheets developed will enable the designer to fix the depth of flat slab during the initial phase of the design...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{spatial and}} temporal characteristics of mechanisms that bridge gaps between line segments. Methods: The presentation time was measured which was necessary for localization and identification of a triangular shape made up of (a) pacmen, (b) pacmen with extended lines, (c) lines, (<b>d)</b> <b>corners</b> or (e) pacmen with circles (see Figure). The triangle was embedded {{in a field of}} distractors of the same components at random orientations. Subjects had to indicate whether the triangle was left or right of the midline (localization) and pointing up or down (identification). Poststimulus masks consisted of pinwheels (a, b, e) or random lines (c, d). Stimuli were presented on a gray background and defined by luminance or isoluminant contrast. Results: Thresholds for identification were fastest when the triangle was defined by real contours (b: 98 msec; c: 106 msec), slightly slower for corners and pacmen (d: 129 msec; a: 157 msec), and much slower for the amodally completed pacmen (e: 359 msec). For all pattern types localization was about 20 msec faster than identification. Compared to low contrast luminance stimuli, processing of isoluminant stimuli was equally fast for targets defined by real contours (c), but much slower for illusory contours (a). Conclusions: Since processing is faster for corners than for pacmen, bridging line gaps is not dependent on the formation of illusory contours...|$|R
40|$|Arranging a {{predetermined}} number n of points over a unit cube in the d-dimensional space or over a polyhedral region is frequently asked in many applications. The discrepancy theory concerns about deviation from a perfect uniform distribution of those points [1, 2]. What is required {{is a set}} of points that are uniformly distributed over the region. In this paper we would like to insert n points in a given region {{in such a way that}} points are distributed as uniformly as possible at every instance of inserting a point. In the sense our problem is considered as a dynamic version of the discrepancy. Our criteria on uniformity is to minimize the gap ratio (which is the maximum gap over the minimum gap) at every point insertion. We present a preliminary result for this problem, that is, we give a linear time algorithm for finding an optimal point sequence with the maximum gap ratio bounded by 2 ⌊n/ 2 ⌋/(⌊n/ 2 ⌋+ 1) in the 1 -dimensional case. 1 Problem Definition This paper considers how to insert {{a predetermined}} number n of points into the d-dimensional unit cube as uniformly as possible.

40|$|The near wake {{of square}} {{cylinders}} with different corner radii was experimentally studied based on particle imaging velocimetry (PIV), laser doppler anemometry (LDA) and hotwire measurements. Four bluff bodies, i. e., r/d= 0 (square cylinder), 0. 157, 0. 236, 0. 5 (circular cylinder), where r is <b>corner</b> radius and <b>d</b> is the characteristic {{dimension of the}} bluff bodies, were examined. A conditional sampling technique was developed to obtain the phase-averaged PIV data in order to characterize quantitatively the effect of corner radii on the near-wake flow structure. The results show that, as r/d increases from 0 to 0. 5, the maximum strength of shed vortices attenuates, the circulation associated with the vortices decreases progressively by 50 %, the Strouhal number, St, increases by about 60 %, the convection velocity of the vortices increases along with the widening of the wake width by about 25 %, the vortex formation length and the wake closure length almost double in size. Meanwhile, both the vortex wavelength, λ x, and the lateral spacing, λ y, decrease as r/d increases, but the ratio of λ y to λ x is approximately 0. 29, irrespective of r/d, which {{is close to the}} theoretical value of 0. 281 for a stable Karman vortex street. The decrease in wavelength is probably responsible for the change in the flow structure from the approximately circular-shaped vortex at r/d= 0 to the laterally stretched vortex at r/d= 0. 5. The leading edge corner radius {{is more important than the}} trailing one in influencing the near wake structure since it determines to a great extent the behavior of the streamlines, the separation angle and the base pressure. It is further found that the ratio of the mean drag coefficient to the total shed circulation, C d/Γ 0, approaches a constant, about 0. 25 for different bluff bodies in the subcritical flow regime. The streamwise evolution of vortices and the streamwise fluctuating velocity along the centerline for rounded cylinders are also discussed. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
