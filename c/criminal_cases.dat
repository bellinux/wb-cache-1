5|$|In United States v. More (1805), the Court {{held that}} the {{ordinary}} means of appeal, the writ of error, could not be utilized in <b>criminal</b> <b>cases</b> from the circuit courts. This contributed {{to the importance of}} the certificate of division in <b>criminal</b> <b>cases.</b> The Marshall Court (18011835) heard thirty-one <b>criminal</b> <b>cases</b> arising from certificates of division; the Taney Court (1836–1864), fifteen; the Chase Court (1864–1873), seventeen; the Waite Court (18741888), thirty-eight; and the Fuller Court (18881910), fourteen.|$|E

And, between 1790 and 1801, only 426 <b>criminal</b> <b>cases</b> were brought in all federal courts (the district courts and the circuit courts combined). Between 1801 and 1828, a total of 2,718 criminal indictments were returned in the circuit courts: 596 resulted in guilty verdicts by juries; 479, not guilty verdicts by juries; 902, nolle prosequi; and 741, other (either no disposition recorded, abated, quashed, discharged, discontinued, or prison break).|$|E
50|$|Only {{the state}} may bring a <b>criminal</b> <b>case.</b> Generally a {{prosecutor}} starts a <b>criminal</b> <b>case</b> by filing a complaint. The court is directly involved in a <b>criminal</b> <b>case</b> {{from the beginning to}} protect the rights of the defendant. Parties have a right to discovery in a <b>criminal</b> <b>case,</b> but discovery is not as extensive in a <b>criminal</b> <b>case</b> as in a civil case because the state must have completed most of its investigation before bringing criminal charges.|$|R

5|$|The Sharia {{courts have}} general {{jurisdiction}} over most civil and <b>criminal</b> <b>cases.</b> At present, {{there are two}} types of courts of first instance: general courts and summary courts dealing with lesser cases.

Between 2004 and 2012, his lawyers submitted several unsuccessful applications to the <b>Criminal</b> <b>Cases</b> Review Commission.

5|$|The Hale Commission was {{established}} by the Commonwealth of England on 30 January 1652 and led by Sir Matthew Hale to investigate law reform. Consisting of eight lawyers and thirteen laymen, the Commission met approximately {{three times a week}} and proposed changes as radical (at the time) as reducing the use of the death penalty, allowing witnesses, legal aid and lawyers for defendants in <b>criminal</b> <b>cases</b> and creating County Courts and a Court of Appeal for <b>criminal</b> <b>cases.</b> Though the Commission was unsuccessful at passing any of its measures under the Rump Parliament, two of its measures were put into law by the subsequent Barebone's Parliament, and, {{by the middle of the}} 20th century, most of the others were as well. Debate has occurred over the effectiveness and strife within the Commission between its more moderate and radical members; the general conclusion is that with the sheer volume of work produced and the vast proportion of moderate to radical members, it is unlikely such strife existed.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Court possessed {{jurisdiction}} in <b>criminal</b> <b>cases</b> only via writs of error from state courts, original writs of habeas corpus, and certificates of division from the circuit courts. In three cases involving certificates of division, the Marshall Court decided issues of double jeopardy, {{but did not}} clearly rely on the Double Jeopardy Clause. Similarly, the Marshall Court discussed the level of detail required for a sufficient indictment without explicitly citing the Information Clause of the Sixth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court of the United States issued {{almost no}} {{constitutional}} criminal procedure decisions {{for its first}} century of existence. Professor Akhil Amar highlights two reasons for this. First, the Court's decision in Barron v.

Second, the Court lacked general appellate jurisdiction over federal <b>criminal</b> <b>cases</b> until 1891.|$|E
