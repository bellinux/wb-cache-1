40|$|This study {{presents}} an internally consistent macroeconomic framework {{that could be}} used as a first step toward a more comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessment of the adjustment alternatives facing Uzbekistan. The three-gap framework focuses on the major imbalances of the economy for evaluating policy choices facing Uzbekistan. It lays emphasis on both domestic and external factors that determine economic outcomes and welfare. An attempt is made to quantify two policy scenarios (i. e. gradual as against an accelerated policy implementation strategy). It turns out that an aggressive adjustment policy would indeed improve most performance and welfare indicators. Two major ingredients of such an aggressive adjustment strategy are the unification of the exchange rate and implementation of current account convertibility in the balance of payments. The study also draws attention to the relative importance of external financing and the sustainability of the balance of payments under alternative structural adjustment paths facing Uzbekistan.

40|$|Land {{and real}} estate reforms have not been {{effective}} at achieving their objectives, {{in part because of}} how they have been designed and implemented. To be successful, reforms must become comprehensive in design, argue the authors, although implementation may be phased over time and take local conditions into account. Reform must include three elements: 1) Institutional reforms that better define property rights, reduce information asymmetry, and improve contract enforcement. 2) Capital market reforms that make mortgage finance available at reasonable rates, especially for the poor. 3) Market reforms that reduce or eliminate the main distortions in the prices of goods and services produced by land {{and real estate}} assets. In their review of land and real estate reforms supported by the World Bank, the authors find that such reforms receive less attention at the conceptual stage than they should, considering their great impact on poverty, growth, and stability. They base their conclusion on the limited coverage of land and real estate issues in <b>country</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>strategies,</b> the main vehicle for identifying priority areas for reform. Most Bank-supported projects do not address all three elements critical for reform. And most provide no justification for excluding them, and no plan for follow-up. The Bank's Operations Evaluation Department rates Bank-supported land and real estate projects relatively well on outcome and sustainability but not on institutional development. But land and real estate reform is institutional by nature. The authors urge the Bank and policymakers to change course. After a comprehensive assessment of the status of real estate institutions and markets, all actors in this sector should be pulled together to develop a comprehensive approach to land and real estate reform.

50|$|In October 2002, {{bilateral}} and multilateral lenders {{led by the}} World Bank agreed to give Yemen a four-year economic support package worth US$2.3 billion, 20 percent in grants and 80 percent in concessional loans. This funding is almost eight {{times the amount of}} financial support Yemen received under the IMF's PRGF. However, in December 2005 the World Bank announced that because of the government's continued inability to effect significant economic reforms and stem corruption, funding would be reduced by more than one-third, from US$420 million to US$240 million for the period July 2005 - July 2008. In May 2006, the World Bank adopted a new <b>Country</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Strategy</b> (CAS) for Yemen for the period FY 2006 to FY 2009, providing a blueprint for fostering the country's fiscal and human development improvement. The bank pledged to contribute approximately US$400 million in International Development Association (IDA) credits over the CAS time frame. At present, Yemen owes approximately US$264 million to Japan, one of its largest donors. In December 2005, the Japanese government pledged to write off US$17 million of the debt. That same month, Germany pledged to increase its annual aid to Yemen to US$83.6 million over the next two years; funding will go primarily to education and water improvement projects.

40|$|While {{we know a}} {{lot about}} how {{countries}} become prosperous, we have only begun to understand how aid contributes to economic growth and poverty reduction. The development record is mixed and no robust association between the volume of aid and development performance has been unearthed. Cross country regressions do not throw much light on the reality of aid. The novel mix of qualitative and quantitative methods fashioned by independent evaluators is more informative regarding aid effectiveness both at project level and at country level. A new brand of <b>country</b> <b>assistance</b> evaluations demonstrates that success at project level matters even if it does not always translate into success at country level - the 'micro-macro paradox'. Well managed aid works when it uses instruments that are tailored to specific country contexts. Budget support mechanisms and program aid instruments {{have a role to play}} in some circumstances. Projects are the aid vehicles of choice in others. The popular notion that development effectiveness can be ensured through the targeting of aid towards countries that are classified as good performers by idealized sets of indicators has been discredited. Conversely, recent policy research findings suggest that, despite the risks involved, aid does the most good when it privileges the weakest and poorest economies and those most vulnerable to shock. To achieve development effectiveness at country level, coherence of interventions is critical as is judicious sequencing. Development operations should be (i) selected to fit within coherent <b>country</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>strategies,</b> (ii) aligned with the priorities of the country and (iii) coordinated with other policies and the actions of partners. This is because the quality of aid matters as much as its quantity since it is a transmission belt for ideas, a device to train development leaders, an instrument to build state capacity and a platform for policy experimentation and dissemination. The final proposition offered by this paper is that professionally administered aid works but that it would work even better in concert with reforms of rich countries' policies. The new development agenda should extend beyond aid. It should aim at levelling the playing field of the global market and at peace building in the zones of turmoil of the developing world.

40|$|Private sector {{assessments}} {{provide information}} and analysis essential to formulating strategies for alleviating constraints on private sector development. They {{are meant to}} contribute both to the Bank's policy dialogue with borrowing governments and to the formulation of <b>country</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>strategies.</b> Theauthors examine the constraints on growth faced by private enterprises and how these relate to the policy and institutional environment in Cote d'Ivoire. They employ new data sources as well as surveys of, and in-depth interviews with, private entrepreneurs. They focus on: the effects of taxes and labor regulation on private firms; the impact of public spending on private sector development; {{and the role of}} informality in enterprise activity. Following are some of their findings. Tax policy and enforcement impose a heavy financial burden on a shrinking base of formal enterprises, whose regulatory burden has also grown. Taxes are increasingly independent of a firm's profits. This substantial fixed cost may lead some businesses to exit prematurely and may discourage others from formal entry. The overall tax burden on small and medium-size enterprises has risen disproportionately, to levels that discourage formal participation in the economy. Informal firms pay some taxes, but there is considerable leakage in collection. Unnecessary rigidities in labor policies weigh less heavily than expected on firms, because they avoid their full costs through such means as subcontracting and apprenticeships. The restrictions nonetheless limit firms'flexibility of operation and ability to reward merit. In the 1980 s, public spending increasingly channeled limited financial resources and human capital toward nondevelopment purposes, including poorly performing enterprises and elite-oriented services, precluding their use in the private sector. The methods of financing public spending (such as withholding taxes and accumulating arrears) have sharply curtailed the capital available to private enterprises. The public sector's dramatic accumulation of arrears and growing reputation as a bad customer are undermining the competitive private supply of goods and services to the government. Government employment policies attract many of the most qualified potential entrepreneurs and business professionals to governmentemployment. Rather than a sharp divide, there is a continuum between small informal and large formal firms. Some medium-size and large formal firms engage in informal behavior, and large firms sometimes lower their costs through links with informal firms - including purchases of inputs that have escaped regulation and taxes.

The external objective is {{to raise awareness of}} the implications of climate change for the economy; to facilitate integration of CC actions into policies and programs, such as the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan; and to support the government in articulating its own strategy for climate change.

Natural disasters already account for more than 0. 5 percent of GDP annually, and climate change is expected to increase these losses further, making it a development issue rather than one confined to environmental concerns. The 2009 typhoons Ondoy and Pepeng alone inflicted damages and losses on the order of $ 4 billion, or almost 3 percent of gross national product.
