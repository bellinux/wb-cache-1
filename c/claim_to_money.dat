Going to his banker (the middle-man between {{exporters}} and importers and the one who deals in such bills) he finds there D, inquiring for some one who has a <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>money</b> in Liverpool, since D owes C in Liverpool for his cargo of steel rails.

The studios had taken action against David Harris and Chris Elsworth, two of the former directors of the company.|$|E
50|$|Here, no trust would arise. TPL had no {{proprietary}} {{interest in the}} {{proceeds of the sale}} of the shares, and even if they did, the banks were bona fide purchasers, and the claim could not be asserted against them. However, TPL did have a proprietary <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>money</b> passed to Versailles, that Versailles mixed with its own, and could thus trace it into the sums given by the receivers to the banks.|$|E

5000|$|The court {{noted that}} if C had sent <b>money</b> <b>to</b> Pemberton in payment of his debt, Pemberton would clearly have had {{superior}} <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> that <b>money.</b> The court then {{held that the}} fact that C sent a commodity (the rum) which had to be converted <b>to</b> <b>money</b> before Pemberton could be paid, made no difference, and Pemberton's claim was upheld. According to the decision, [...] "the whole Court" [...] gave judgment for Pemberton -- thus it appears that the decision was unanimous.|$|R

5000|$|Before Tom [...] "died", he {{scribbled}} a joke [...] "will" [...] {{in which}} he left his worldly goods to Matilda. O'Fipp angrily crumples this up and throws it away.

The review panel to the case agreed that there was no legal or equitable claim, but held that any payment would be a gratuity. Subsequently, Congress failed to act on the proposed bill before Mr. Paul's death in 1994.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{provide a}} {{rationale}} for why money should earn interest; or, what amounts to the same thing, why risk-free <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> non-interestbearing <b>money</b> should trade at discount. I argue that interest-bearing money is essential when individual money balances are private information. The analysis also suggests one reason for why it is sufficient (as well as necessary) for interest to be paid only on large money balances; or equivalently, why bonds need only be issued in large denominations. ...|$|R
