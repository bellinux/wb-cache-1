The Young's moduli for the pre-strained materials were determined in different two ways. For the first case, unlading stress-strain data from σ 0 to 0. 0 MPa was used, and data from σ 0 to (σ 0 - 2 Y 0) {{was used for the}} second case, where σ 0 and Y 0 denote 90 % of the stress at the beginning of unloading and the initial yield stress used in a constitutive equation, respectively. The saturated Young's moduli were significantly different on C 2600 R-H sheet, but similar plastic strain dependency on Young's modulus relationship was found on C 2600 R- 1 / 2 H sheet. Subsequently, U-bending experiments and the corresponding finite element simulations using several combinations of plastic strain dependent Young's moduli and isotropic and kinematic hardening rules were conducted. The simulation results indicated that Young's moduli measured using σ 0 to (σ 0 - 2 Y 0) data with elasto-plastic unloading is the best choice for springback simulation of the <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>sheets...</b>|$|R
