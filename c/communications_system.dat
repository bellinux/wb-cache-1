5|$|At {{the request}} of General Arnold, from 1934 to 1938, McClelland worked to devise a {{permanent}} airways communication system. In 1938, McClelland's efforts yielded {{the establishment of the}} Army Airways <b>Communications</b> <b>System,</b> a group that would develop into the Air Force Network Integration Center.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, McClelland {{organized}} the largest <b>communications</b> <b>system</b> {{the world had}} yet seen. McClelland, rated a command pilot, served as the chief of communications for the Central Intelligence Agency in the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|On April 8, 1946, McClelland {{became the}} first {{commanding}} general of the Airways and Air Communications Service, the group he had originally formed in 1938 as the Army Airways <b>Communications</b> <b>System.</b> On April 24, 1946, he was made commander of the Airways and Air Communications Service Alumni Association.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with these}} six new commands, <b>Communications</b> <b>Systems</b> and Canadian Forces Europe were formed. <b>Communications</b> <b>Systems</b> was formed into a command in 1970; Canadian Forces Europe {{was shut down}} in 1994.|$|R

5|$|Between 1934 and 1938, McClelland {{researched}} {{the technical and}} logistical aspects of long-range air communications, an effort {{which resulted in the}} establishment of the Army Airways <b>Communications</b> <b>System.</b> Following this, he worked in the Operations and Training Division of the War Department General Staff, and served as chief of the Aviation division.|$|E
5|$|After {{four weeks}} at the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) in Fort Polk, Louisiana, Manning was {{deployed}} to Forward Operating Base Hammer, near Baghdad, arriving in October 2009. From her workstation there, she {{had access to}} SIPRNet (the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network) and JWICS (the Joint Worldwide Intelligence <b>Communications</b> <b>System).</b> Two of her superiors had discussed not taking her to Iraq; it was felt she was a risk to herself and possibly others, according to a statement later issued by the Army—but the shortage of intelligence analysts dictated their decision to take her. In November 2009, she was promoted from Private First Class to Specialist.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the rapid}} pace of operations, deployment, and redeployment, {{coordination}} of artillery units and their fires became a worrisome quandary during the operations. This was made even more problematic by the confusion generated {{by the lack of}} adequate communications systems between the rapidly advancing units. The joint nature of the operation added another level of complexity to the already overstretched communications network. Regardless, due to the ability of U.S. logisticians to innovate and improvise, supplies of food, water, ammunition, and spare parts arrived at their destinations without any shortages hampering combat operations and the <b>communications</b> <b>system,</b> although complicated, functioned well enough during the short duration of U.S. operations.|$|E

50|$|In <b>{{communication}}s</b> <b>systems,</b> {{a communication}} channel may change with time. Coherence {{time is the}} time duration over which the channel impulse response {{is considered to be}} not varying. Such channel variation is much more significant in wireless <b>communications</b> <b>systems,</b> due to Doppler effects.|$|R

5|$|From {{the time}} Thompson took control until {{shortly after the}} Second World War, the News-Miner lacked a {{dedicated}} connection to the Associated Press. In {{the early years of}} the Thompson administration, he had a dedicated correspondent in Seattle whose job was to read the early editions of the Seattle newspapers, then hurry to the telegraph office and summarize what he had read to Thompson on the other end of the telegraph cable. This system later was replaced by a dedicated contract with the Alaska <b>Communications</b> <b>System,</b> but that contract limited the News-Miner to no more than 9,000 words per day of messages.|$|E
5|$|Chief of the OKH, General Franz Halder, Fedor von Bock, the {{commander}} of Army Group Center, and almost all the German generals involved in Operation Barbarossa argued vehemently in favor of continuing the all-out drive toward Moscow. Besides the psychological importance of capturing the Soviet capital, the generals pointed out that Moscow was a major center of arms production, {{the center of the}} Soviet <b>communications</b> <b>system</b> and an important transport hub. Intelligence reports indicated that the bulk of the Red Army was deployed near Moscow under Semyon Timoshenko for the defense of the capital. Panzer commander Heinz Guderian was sent to Hitler by Bock and Halder to argue their case for continuing the assault against Moscow but Hitler issued an order through Guderian (bypassing Bock and Halder) to send Army Group Center's tanks to the north and south, temporarily halting the drive to Moscow. Convinced by Hitler's argument, Guderian returned to his commanding officers as a convert to the Führer's plan, which earned him their disdain.|$|E
5|$|In November 2003, Irwin was {{filming a}} {{documentary}} on sea lions {{off the coast of}} Baja California Peninsula in Mexico when he heard via his boat's radio that two scuba divers were reported missing in the area. Irwin and his entire crew suspended operations to aid in the search. His team's divers searched with the rescue divers, and Irwin used his vessel to patrol the waters around the island where the incident occurred, as well as using his satellite <b>communications</b> <b>system</b> to call in a rescue plane. On {{the second day of the}} search, kayakers found one of the divers, Scott Jones, perched on a narrow rock ledge jutting out from the side of a cliff. Irwin and a crew member escorted him to Irwin's boat. Jones did not recognise Irwin. The other lost diver, Katie Vrooman, was found dead by a search plane later the same day not far from Jones' location.|$|E

Due to water pressure, the park is estimated to implode after 119 hours; the water pressure also ensures that the characters cannot escape by swimming, as it would crush their lungs. If the player plays as Takeshi, he builds a relationship with Tsugumi, who reveals {{that she and her}} pet hamster Chami are carriers of the Cure virus, which has rewritten their genetic code, and halted their biological aging. She and Takeshi have sex, and she is impregnated. Later, Coco becomes sick. It is revealed that a research facility exists under LeMU, called IBF, and that LeMU was created by the Leiblich Pharmaceutical company as a cover for IBF. The facility developed the deadly virus Tief Blau; the LeMU disaster was caused when IBF lost containment of it. Coco was exposed to the virus while visiting her father, an IBF researcher.|$|E
