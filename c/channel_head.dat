50|$|Channel {{initiation}} {{refers to}} the site on a mountain slope where water begins to flow between identifiable banks. This site {{is referred to as}} the <b>channel</b> <b>head</b> and it marks an important boundary between hillslope processes and fluvial processes. The <b>channel</b> <b>head</b> is the most upslope part of a channel network and is defined by flowing water between defined identifiable banks. A <b>channel</b> <b>head</b> forms as overland flow and/or subsurface flow accumulate to a point where shear stress can overcome erosion resistance of the ground surface. Channel heads are often associated with colluvium, hollows and landslides.|$|E

These threshold conditions are determined by considering the <b>channel</b> <b>heads</b> observed across {{a portion of the}} study area and computing the related values of (1) drainage area A, (2) area-slope function AS 2, with S being the local slope, and (3) Strahler order ! of surface flow paths extracted from gridded elevation data. Attention is focused on the dependence of the obtained threshold values on the size of grid cells involved and on the ability of the identified threshold conditions to provide reliable predictions of <b>channel</b> <b>heads</b> across the entire study area. The results indicate that the threshold values of A, AS 2, and ! are all significantly dependent on grid cell size, and the uncertainty in the determination of threshold values of ! is significantly smaller than that affecting the determination of threshold values of A and AS 2. The comparison between predicted and observed <b>channel</b> <b>heads</b> indicates that the considered methods display variable reliability and sensitivity over different drainage basins and grid cell sizes, with a general tendency to predict more <b>channel</b> <b>heads</b> than can be observed in the field. Acceptable predictions are normally obtained where <b>channel</b> <b>heads</b> are formed essentially by surface runoff.

In the 24 <b>channel</b> <b>heads</b> selected {{in the southern part of}} the Parsęta catchment (NW Poland), the zones of occurrence of the following processes were identified: (1) seepage erosion; (2) falls, dry ravel events and slides; (3) creep, solifluction, surface runoff and erosion; (4) channel processes; and (5) landforms created under the impact of plants and animals. The co-occurrence of various morphogenetic processes produces variations in the accumulation conditions, and as a result, a diversity of deposits. <b>Channel</b> <b>heads</b> morphology shows the effect of the topography of the zero-discharge catchment, the type and magnitude of groundwater outflows, the variability of the geological structure, and the possibility of material being removed from the alcoves...|$|R

50|$|Characteristic landforms {{caused by}} {{groundwater}} sapping are “theater-shaped” <b>channel</b> <b>heads</b> and “U-shaped” valleys, {{which have a}} consistent width and steep valley walls. Weakened basal rocks are unable to support more resistant upper layers, causing valley head and sidewalls to collapse inwards. Theater-shaped <b>channel</b> <b>heads</b> are characterized by overhanging sidewalls that are relatively dry compared to the lower level rocks below the zone of seepage. The development of theater heads has been related to “ground-water flow direction, jointing and faulting, permeability contrasts, formation slope and dip angles, and formation cohesion”. The morphology of channels and valleys created by sapping are highly dependent on regional scale geology, and {{can be hard to}} distinguish from features created through alternative processes. Chemical precipitates can be used as indicators of groundwater water discharge implying that a valley or channel may have been formed as a result of sapping. These sorts of clues are important in areas where water is not currently being discharged.|$|R
40|$|The chief {{aims of the}} {{research}} conducted {{in the southern part}} of the Parsęta drainage basin (NW Poland) are to characterise the organisation of the river system in <b>channel</b> <b>heads</b> and to determine the role of groundwater outflows in their development. The geomorphological, lithological, hydrological and hydrochemical studies performed made it possible to obtain a picture of how <b>channel</b> <b>heads</b> operate in the postglacial zone of the Polish Plain. In the 88 <b>channel</b> <b>heads,</b> zones of occurrence of the following processes were identified: seepage erosion; falls, dry ravel events and slides; creep, solifluction, surface runoff and erosion; channel processes; and landforms created under the impact of plants, animals and humans. The co-occurrence of several morphogenetic processes creates a variety of depositional conditions in alcoves, leading as a result to the accumulation of several sets of deposit. They are a record of headwater erosion and accumulation, fluvial deposition and redeposition, chemogenic and biochemogenic sedimentation, biogenic sedimentation, and sedentation. Headwater areas can be divided with respect to landforms of a higher taxonomic order (initial morphological surfaces) into slope, inserted, and scarp types. Each of those three types of headwater alcove has a different mechanism of initiation and development as well as its own way of joining the permanent river network. The development of a river network can proceed towards higher-order channels (downslope development) with a stream extending towards a watershed divide in the case of slope and inserted alcoves, and from a higher-order channel towards the watershed divide (upslope development) in the case of scarp alcoves...|$|R
40|$|Stream {{channels}} {{enhance the}} hydrological connectivity between land surface elements. The representation and prediction of stream channels in drainage basins has therefore been a perennial concern in geomorphology, with implications for understanding of drainage basin origin, scale and morphology, basin hydrology, {{and effects of}} natural and man-induced process changes. The channel (or stream) network is defined by channels with well-defined banks and sources. In theory, the channel network includes all the minor rills which are definite watercourses, even including all the ephemeral channels in the furthermost headwaters. In practice, the direct survey of all channels is normally a prohibitive task, and the detail with which the channel network is represented {{is dependent on the}} scale of the map used to trace the channels. In actual fact, the headward limits of the blue lines do not reflect any statistical characteristic of streamflow occurrence, but they are drawn to fit a rather personalized aesthetic. On the other hand, the explicit description of the mechanisms determining the <b>channel</b> <b>heads</b> is a nontrivial task since it requires complex fluvial and/or landsliding processes to be considered singly or in combination. However, the increasing availability of highly accurate digital elevation data derived from LiDAR surveys, reliable terrain analysis methods, and observations collected in the field or remotely, offers new potential for developing and/or evaluating prediction models for channel initiation. In addition to detailed models, simpler generalizations from field facts can be sought by incorporating the broad features of climate, topography, and geology. In the present study, methods for the determination of surface flow paths are briefly reviewed. Three methods for the prediction of channel networks are then evaluated by using gridded elevation data derived from high-precision LiDAR surveys, a reliable algorithm for the determination of surface flow paths, and accurate field observations of <b>channel</b> <b>heads</b> for sites located in the eastern Italian Alps. These three methods are based on different threshold conditions for channel initiation, defined in terms of: (1) drainage area, (2) monomial function of drainage area and local slope, and (3) Strahler order of surface flow paths extracted from gridded elevation data. Attention is especially focused on the dependence of threshold conditions on the size of grid cells involved. The results indicate that: (i) all threshold conditions for channel initiation are grid cell size depended, (ii) the methods based on drainage area and Strahler order provide robust predictions of <b>channel</b> <b>heads,</b> and (iii) the threshold in the Strahler order of surface flow paths extracted from gridded elevation data follows quite well a scaling relation of grid cell size. The analysis carried out shows that the considered methods may provide a sound rationale for the prediction of <b>channel</b> <b>heads</b> formed essentially by surface erosion, but it reveals that more comprehensive methods are needed to predict <b>channel</b> <b>heads</b> influenced by groundwater seeping upwards...|$|R
