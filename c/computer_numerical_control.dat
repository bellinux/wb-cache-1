40|$|Over {{the last}} 50 years, the {{development}} of <b>computer</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machines has seen a plethora of part programming languages being developed. The large majority of these languages {{are based on the}} ISO 6983 standard which is commonly known as G&M codes, but other languages from machine tool suppliers are also used for programming machine tools. These programming languages have provided major barriers for the interoperability of such information between <b>computer</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machines and also from <b>computer</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machines to computer-aided systems. Thus, the process knowledge in existing part programs cannot be recycled and reused easily, due to an inability to interpret these forms of data. In this article, a new meta-model of <b>computer</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> part programming languages has been proposed. The meta-model aims to abstract the characteristics of <b>computer</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machine activities and interpret/represent process information within <b>computer</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> part programs written in different languages or dialects. Realising the translation between the meta-model and different part programming languages, it is possible to capture the shopfloor knowledge from <b>computer</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machines without the need to develop individual interpreting interfaces for each programming language. The valuable process knowledge can thus be captured from the part programs and represented in a neutral presentation to facilitate the knowledge accumulation and management, which is vital for manufacturing companies to gain competitive advantages in the globalised market...|$|R

25|$|The {{hand tool}} form of router is the {{original}} form. It is a specialized type of hand plane with a broad base and a narrow blade projecting well beyond its base plate (gaining it the nickname old woman's tooth). Today the power tool form of router, with an electric-motor-driven spindle, is the more common form, and the hand tool is now often called a router plane. Although the hand tool has a few advantages over the power tool and retains favour with some workers, it has been mostly replaced by the modern spindle router, which was designed for the same work. Some workers consider {{it to be the}} single most versatile woodworking power tool. Becoming more popular is the use of a CNC wood router, which implements the advantages of CNC (<b>Computer</b> <b>Numerical</b> <b>Control).</b>|$|E

2500|$|Modern <b>computer</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> (CNC) lathes and (CNC) {{machining}} centres can do secondary operations like milling by using driven tools.

2500|$|Milling is {{the complex}} shaping of metal or other {{materials}} by removing material {{to form the}} final shape. It is generally done on a milling machine, a power-driven machine that in its basic form consists of a milling cutter that rotates about the spindle axis (like a drill), and a worktable that can move in multiple directions (usually two dimensions [...] relative to the workpiece). The spindle usually moves in the z axis. [...] It is possible to raise the table (where the workpiece rests). [...] Milling machines may be operated manually or under <b>computer</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> (CNC), and can perform {{a vast number of}} complex operations, such as slot cutting, planing, drilling and threading, rabbeting, routing, etc. Two common types of mills are the horizontal mill and vertical mill.|$|E

This development would considerably improve both productivity and efficiency and consequently would improve cost effectiveness. The smaller manufacturer is unable to afford the more sophisticated <b>Computer</b> <b>Numerical</b> <b>Controlled</b> Drill equipment and the software packages which drive them. It was necessary for the <b>Computer</b> <b>Numerical</b> <b>Controlled</b> machine to possess all the capabilities and versatility of the more sophisticated and expensive equipment, and yet still be affordable to the smaller manufacturer. Furthermore, since such equipment would need to be operated in fairly hostile environments, it would need to be robust and reliable. This interdisciplinary development has required the knowledge and skill from many different engineering fields, and made them readily available to industry which otherwise would not have had access to them. The South African economy at present, has a growing need for smaller and medium business enterprises, and the needs of these must be appropriately served.

This created a {{significant}} economy of scale, allowing the company to rely upon factory automation rather than skilled labor for rough shaping of components and basic assembly tasks. Even so, 60% of the construction process was still done by hand, including planing, fretting, joining, and assembly.
