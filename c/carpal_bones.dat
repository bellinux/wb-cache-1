5|$|The manus was {{composed}} merely {{of the five}} metacarpalia, which were orientated vertically and arranged in a semicircle. <b>Carpal</b> <b>bones</b> were missing, as in other titanosaurs. Finger bones and claws were also completely absent – in most other titanosaurs, these bones were still present though extremely reduced in size. In the foot, the talus bone was strongly reduced as in other titanosaurs, while the calcaneus was probably completely absent in Opisthocoelicaudia. In contrast to the manus, the foot showed well developed digits and claws. The phalangeal formula, which states the number of phalanges (digit bones) beginning with the innermost digit, is 2-2-2-1-0. Foot skeletons of titanosaurs are rarely found, and besides Opisthocoelicaudia, completely preserved examples are known only from Epachthosaurus and the unnamed La Invernada titanosaur, whose phalangeal formulas are 2-2-3-2-0 and 2-2-2-2-0, respectively. Of these three titanosaurs, Ophistocoelicaudia was the most derived while showing the fewest phalanges, indicating a progressive reduction in the phalangeal count during titanosaur evolution. The claw of the first digit was not larger than {{than that of the}} second digit, as in other sauropods, but roughly equal in size.|$|E
25|$|Tocheri et al. (2007) (including Morwood, Larson, and Jungers), {{compared}} three <b>carpal</b> <b>bones</b> {{believed to}} belong to LB1 with <b>carpal</b> <b>bones</b> of modern humans, some earlier hominids (that is, hominins), and African apes. They concluded that the carpals from the Liang Bua cave resembled ape <b>carpal</b> <b>bones</b> and were {{significantly different from the}} bones of H.nbsp&sapiens, Homo neanderthalensis or even Homo antecessor, and that they were comparable to <b>carpal</b> <b>bones</b> of Australopithecus. The <b>carpal</b> <b>bones</b> of H.nbsp&floresiensis were found to lack features that evolved with ancestors of modern humans at least about 800,000 years ago. These features are already formed during embryogenesis and therefore Tocheri et al. argue that it is improbable that the shape of H.nbsp&floresiensis wrist bones could be a result of a developmental disease. This evidence also suggests that H. Florensiensis is not a modern human with an undiagnosed pathology or growth defect, but that it represents a species descended from a hominin ancestor that branched off before the last common ancestor of the clade that includes modern humans, Neandertals, and other modern hominins.|$|E

40|$|This seminar {{chronicled the}} case of a puppy that {{suffered}} bilateral accessory <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> fractures after jumping from a second-story window. A history was taken and a physical exam was performed to create a problem list that included pain, crepitus, and hyperextension of both carpi. Differentials were discussed, and a diagnostic plan was developed to narrow the list of possible diagnoses through the use of radiography. Bilateral accessory <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> fractures were identified on lateral carpal radiographs. Three possible methods of treatment were evaluated to treat the accessory <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> fractures: external coaptation alone, surgical excision of fracture fragments, and internal fixation of the fractures. The owners chose internal screw fixation, and the procedure was successful...|$|R
40|$|The authors report 13 {{dogs with}} radiocarpal bone fracture. The lesion was {{bilateral}} in six cases and unilater-alin seven. Clinical and radiographic examination ofboth the carpal joints was performed. One or two fracturelines, sagittal oblique and dorsal, of the radial carpalbone were detected. CT examination of two radialcarpal bones helped {{in a better}} visualization of thefracture lines. A dorsal bone fragment of a fracturedradial <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> was removed in one dog. Histopathologyrevealed the presence of fibro-connective tissueon the fracture surface of the bone fragment. Thefibro-connective tissue {{did not seem to}} be the sequelto acute or chronic diseases, nor to any pathologicalhealing process. The cancellous bone of the fragmentwas normal as was the bulk of the articular cartilageexamined. A CT guided biopsy, including the sagittaloblique fracture surface of the radial <b>carpal</b> <b>bone,</b> wasalso performed. The specimens revealed the presenceof immature cancellous bone with diffuse immaturecartilage areas. The radial <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> has three separatecentres of ossification: the primitive radial carpalbone, the central and intermediate <b>carpal</b> <b>bone.</b> Thefusion of these centres occurs at 3 - 4 months of age. Histopathological findings suggest a possible "incompletefusion" of the centres of ossification rather thana true fracture of the radial <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> or alternativelya "fatigue fracture".

40|$|Background: Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) is {{a constellation of}} symptoms associated with compression of the median nerve at the wrist in carpal tunnel. The Purpose {{of this study is}} to find the comparative effective of <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> mobilization and neural mobilization in improving pain, Functional Status and Symptom Severity in patients with CTS. Method: An experimental study design, 30 subjects with carpal {{tunnel syndrome}} were randomized into 2 groups with 15 subjects each in Group A and Group B. Subjects in Group A received <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> mobilization and subjects in Group B received median nerve mobilization. The duration of intervention was for two weeks. Outcome measurements such as pain using VAS, The Functional Status Score (FSS) and Symptom Severity Score (SSS) using the Boston’s questionnaire for CTS were measured before and after two weeks of intervention. Results: Analysis using paired ‘t’ test found that there is a statistically significant improvement (p< 0. 05) in pain, Functional Status score and Symptom Severity score within the groups. Comparative analysis using independent ‘t’ test found that there is no statistically significant difference in improving pain, Functional Status score and Symptom Severity score between both the groups. Conclusion: It is concluded that median nerve mobilization and <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> mobilization shown to be effective on improving pain, Functional Status and Symptom Severity in the treatment of patients presenting with carpal tunnel syndrome. However there is no significant difference in improvements obtained between the neural mobilization and <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> mobilisation...|$|R
40|$|Children {{development}} stage {{is determined by}} physical growth. The sequence of growing process is usually constant, however, {{the age at which}} children can reach a certain sequence varies individually. Determining skeletal maturation by evaluating <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> and cervical vertebrae is very helpful in conducting orthodontic diagnosis and in planning proper treatment. Such evaluation enables to estimate the time of growing process to accelerate or decelerate. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the stage of <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> and cervical vertebrae maturation in orthodontic patients at the age of 9 to 18. Samples were 83 cephalograms and hand wrist x-ray from 52 girls and 31 boys. The result of this study showed that the stage of <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> and cervical vertebrae maturation in girls and boys in the same age group varies greatly. Girls at the age of 11 to 12 demonstrated highest variation in the stage of maturation. In the same age group of sample, all stages of the maturation indicator were found, such as epiphysis is as wide as diaphysis, the capping of epiphysis, as well as variation in epiphysis fusion. These kinds of variations also occurred in the cervical vertebrae maturation stage, where it varies from cervical vertebrae stage 2 to 6. On the other hand, boys showed highest variation at the age of 13 to 14. This study suggests that there was a matching pattern between <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> and cervical vertebrae maturation. </p...|$|R
25|$|The lunate bone (semilunar bone) is a carpal bone in {{the human}} hand. It is {{distinguished}} by its deep concavity and crescentic outline. It is situated {{in the center of}} the proximal row <b>carpal</b> <b>bones,</b> which lie between the ulna and radius and the hand. The lunate carpal bone is situated between the lateral scaphoid bone and medial triquetral bone.|$|E
25|$|The {{adductor}} pollicis {{also has}} two heads. The transversal head originates {{along the entire}} third metacarpal bone, while the oblique head originates on the <b>carpal</b> <b>bones</b> proximal to the third metacarpal. The muscle is inserted onto the ulnar sesamoid bone of the metacarpophalangeal joint. It adducts the thumb, and assists in opposition and flexion. It is innervated by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve (C8-T1).|$|E
25|$|The {{scaphoid}} bone {{is one of}} the <b>carpal</b> <b>bones</b> of the wrist. It is situated between the hand and forearm on the thumb side of the wrist (also called the lateral or radial side). It forms the radial border of the carpal tunnel. The {{scaphoid bone}} is the largest bone of the proximal row of wrist bones, its long axis being from above downward, lateralward, and forward. It is approximately {{the size and shape of}} a medium cashew.|$|E
40|$|The {{degree of}} {{ossification}} of <b>carpal</b> and tarsal <b>bones</b> was determined in normal foals of various ages and in hypothyroid and thyroidectomized foals. In normal foals ossification occurred very rapidly {{in the last few}} weeks of gestation and less rapidly from birth to 33 days. The ulnar <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> was consistently less ossified than other <b>carpal</b> or tarsal <b>bones.</b> Foals with congenital hyperplastic goitre had retarded ossification of the cuboidal bones, especially the central and third tarsal bones.

50|$|Extensor carpi ulnar: {{originates}} on {{the lateral}} epicondyle of the humerus and inserts on the metacarpal 5 and the accessory <b>carpal</b> <b>bone.</b> It acts to abduct {{and extend the}} carpal joint. It is innervated by the radial nerve.|$|R
5000|$|Associated with {{a reduced}} {{size in the}} {{accessory}} <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> on back of knee over which the tendons pass. The small joints are prone to injury and don’t provide adequate support for the column of leg while under weight-bearing stress.|$|R
25|$|The palmar {{surface of}} the {{scaphoid}} is concave, and forming a tubercle, giving attachment to the transverse carpal ligament. The proximal surface is triangular, smooth and convex, and articulates with the radius and adjacent <b>carpal</b> <b>bones,</b> namely the lunate, capitate, trapezium and trapezioid. The lateral surface is narrow and gives attachment to the radial collateral ligament. The medial surface has two facets, a flattened semi-lunar facet articulating with the lunate bone, and an inferior concave facet, articulating alongside the lunate {{with the head of}} the capitate bone.|$|E
25|$|The median nerve can be {{compressed}} by {{a decrease}} {{in the size of the}} canal, an increase in the size of the contents (such as the swelling of lubrication tissue around the flexor tendons), or both. Since the carpal tunnel is bordered by <b>carpal</b> <b>bones</b> on one side and a ligament on the other, when the pressure builds up inside the tunnel, there is nowhere for it to escape and thus it ends up pressing up against and damaging the median nerve. Simply flexing the wrist to 90 degrees will decrease the size of the canal.|$|E
25|$|Two {{orthopedic}} studies {{published in}} 2007 reported {{evidence to support}} species status for H.floresiensis. A study of three tokens of carpal (wrist) bones concluded there were differences from the <b>carpal</b> <b>bones</b> of modern humans and similarities to those of a chimpanzee or an early hominin such as Australopithecus. A study of the bones and joints of the arm, shoulder, and lower limbs also concluded that H.floresiensis was more similar to early humans and other apes than modern humans. In 2009, {{the publication of a}} cladistic analysis and a study of comparative body measurements provided further support for the hypothesis that H.floresiensis and Homo sapiens are separate species.|$|E
25|$|The lunate is stabilised by a medial {{ligament}} to the scaphoid and a lateral ligament to the triquetrum. Ligaments between the radius and <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> also stabilise {{the position of}} the lunate, as does its position in the lunate fossa of the radius.|$|R

40|$|The authors {{developed}} a 3 D CT technique to analyze in vivo variations in <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> position based on 3 D reconstruction of transverse CT data in 5 wrist positions. The subject groups analyzed consisted of 40 asymptomatic volunteers and 30 patients with various wrist disorders (fractures, instabilities). In 11 anatomic specimens, this kinematic analysis {{was completed by}} a radiographic morphologic study and an investigation of capsular ligament anatomy. Clinical applications showed that <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> motion in the injured wrist was {{not significantly different from}} contralateral, asymptomatic wrist motion. In both wrists of patients with unilateral pathology, however, significant differences were observed as compared with asymptomatic volunteers. Scaphoid motion was bilaterally altered, suggesting the existence of anatomic or kinematic factors predisposing to certain carpal pathologies. Journal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
25|$|Bone spavin is osteoarthritis, or {{the final}} phase of {{degenerative}} joint disease (DJD), in the lower three hock joints. It usually affects the two lowest joints of the hock (the tarsometatarsal and the distal intertarsal joints), with the third joint, the proximal intertarsal, being the least likely to develop bone spavin. This condition has various types: jack spavin when lesion on the tarsal and <b>carpal</b> <b>bones</b> is large, and high spavin when the pathology occurs higher in the joint than is typical. Conversely, occult spavin does not produce any significant exostoses on the small tarsals, whilst bog spavin and blood spavin do not involve bony changes.|$|E
25|$|This {{conclusion}} was challenged by Robert Martin (after Jacob's death the leading {{proponent of the}} microcephaly hypothesis) and Alan Thorne. Martin noted that no {{research has been done}} on wrists of microcephalic people. Thorne maintained that the differences were small and that similar variation could occur with living modern humans. He also pointed out that the <b>carpal</b> <b>bones</b> had been found scattered in the cave and it was not certain that they all belonged to the same individual. Project leader Morwood countered that there were also other features, such as the stature, body proportions, brain size, shoulder, pelvis, jaw, and teeth which suggested that H.nbsp&floresiensis is a separate hominin species that evolved in isolation on the island.|$|E
500|$|Dinocephalosaurus had {{relatively}} large legs terminating in flipper-like feet.

Whereas most protorosaurs, such as Tanystropheus, Macrocnemus, and Langobardisaurus, had relatively ossified limbs adapted for terrestrial life, the stout limbs of Dinocephalosaurus are poorly ossified and resemble those of nothosaurs. Out of the <b>carpal</b> <b>bones,</b> only six are ossified; similarly, {{only three of the}} tarsal bones are ossified. Additionally, the astragalus and calcaneum also do not articulate with each other in the ankle, instead forming simple and rounded ossifications.|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) CT {{technique was}} developed to analyze in vivo segmental carpal kinematics. Transverse CT data of the distal forearm, carpals and proximal metacarpals was acquired and 3 D reconstructed in various wrist positions. Carpal kinematics were analyzed in two groups of 20 asymptomatic volunteers, one group in neutral position, flexion and extension (45 degrees), and the other group in neutral position, radial (15 degrees) and ulnar deviation (30 degrees). Qualitative analysis included the 3 D study of carpal anatomy, and comparison of <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> position between the different sets of data obtained. <b>Carpal</b> <b>bone</b> motion was quantified using rigid body and finite helical axis concepts. The results, although agreeing in principle with previous findings, showed important individual variations in <b>carpal</b> <b>bone</b> motion. Clinical applications were conducted {{in a series of}} 25 patients with various wrist disorders. There {{was no significant difference between}} the injured wrist and the heterolateral, asymptomatic wrist, but there was a significant difference between asymptomatic volunteers and both the injured wrist and heterolateral wrist of patients. In particular, scaphoid motion was altered bilaterally in our patient group, suggesting the existence of anatomic and/or kinematic factors predisposing to certain carpal pathologies. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed and refined. Journal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
