The sensor includes a thermocouple wire {{embedded in a}} sheath having two sections disposed {{at right angles to}} each other. The junction of the thermocouple is located at one end of one of the sections and the lead wires extend from the other section.

40|$|Researchers {{have been}} {{incorporated}} ceramics into porous membrane separators {{as a way}} to improve their mechanical, thermal and battery performances. However, the inclusion of preformed ceramics within the polymer membrane can require multiple additional steps. Current methods of ceramic particle inclusion in the polymer network can lead to issues of particle aggregation which can leads to non-uniform membrane performance. Ceramics present on the surface can delaminate from the surface, which would negatively affect the membrane performance. For this study, we aimed to incorporate room temperature curable liquid ceramic precursors into polymer networks to fabricate polymer/ceramic hybrids in a single electrospinning step. First, we combined polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and organopolysilazane (OPSZ) to successfully create polymer-ceramic membranes without the need for further post-treatment. We varied the amount of ceramic precursor added to investigate the effect of ceramic loading on membrane properties and its electrochemical performance. Results show that with increasing as the amount of ceramic, there is an improvement in the mechanical strength and thermal stability of the membranes. There is also an increase in ionic conductivity with increased ceramic inclusion as the presence of the ceramic disrupts the polymers ability to crystallize. The increased ionic conductivity correlated to an increase in battery performance and capacity retention especially at high charge/discharge rates. We note that all nanofiber based separators in the current study have the similar porosity around 80 %, and they exhibit a wide range of the rate iii capability performances due to their different internal and surface morphologies of nanofibers which in turn affect the ionic conductivity. We then used various organopolysilazanes with different ratios of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) pendant chain to polysilazane backbone to investigate the effect of ceramic structures on the membrane performance. Our results demonstrate that changing to the TEOS to polysilazane ratio can affect that the ceramics ability to form a continuous network within the polymer at the same concentration. The ability to form continuous network increases the amorphous regions within the polymer network, leading to an increase in the ionic conductivity which in turn leads to better battery performance. We note that using OPSZ shows an approximately 5 nm <b>ceramic</b> <b>sheath</b> layer forms on the fibers. In order to investigate the effect of this <b>ceramic</b> <b>sheath</b> layer, we incorporated various silica precursors which resulted in various polymer-ceramic morphologies, ranging from no sheath layer,partial sheath layers, and to full shear layer on the polymer/ceramic fibers. Our results reveal that the presence of <b>ceramic</b> <b>sheath</b> layer leads to better membrane-electrolyte interaction which caused the increase in electrolyte uptake and ionic uptake. Additionally, the ceramic on the sheath layer can aid in preventing the buildup of fluorine based particles on the surface on the fiber, leading to improved capacity retention. iv 2021 - 05 - 3...|$|E
40|$|This {{progress}} report covers continuing work {{to develop a}} temperature probe for a coal gasifier. A workable probe design requires finding answers to crucial questions involving the probe materials. We report on attempts to answer those questions. We previously reported an apparent anomaly in the high-temperature behavior of fused-silica optical components. This time, we report on further anomalies in other components. These unexpected results impede or prevent acquiring data related to the project. The commercial manufacturer of gasifier probes had agreed to lend us three <b>ceramic</b> inner <b>sheaths</b> and one outer sheath for experimentation. He subsequently sent us one inner sheath. We designed a test fixture {{to be used in}} a proposed test of phosphor material in a reducing environment at a power company's test facility. Funding delays outside our control caused a related project to be put on hold. Because the two projects shared travel funds, we are unable to continue experimental work until funding resumes. Meanwhile, we are doing some of the labor-intensive data reduction for our recent calibration curves...|$|R
40|$|Future {{turbine engines}} and {{industrial}} systems will be operating at increased temperatures to achieve more demanding efficiency and performance goals. In the highest temperature {{sections of the}} engine new material systems such as ceramics and intermetallics are being considered to withstand the harsh thermal environment. Components constructed of these low expansion-rate materials experience thermal strains and a resulting reduction of life when rigidly attached to high expansion-rate, superalloy support structures. Seals are being designed to both seal and to serve as compliant mounts allowing for relative thermal growths between high temperature but brittle primary structures and the surrounding support structures. Previous seal research yielded several braided rope seal designs which demonstrated the ability to both seal {{and serve as a}} compliant mount. The hybrid seal was constructed of an all-ceramic (alumina-silica) core overbraided with a superalloy wire sheath (cobalt based superalloy). The all ceramic seal was constructed of an all-ceramic (alumina-silica) core overbraided with multiple <b>ceramic</b> (alumina-silica) <b>sheath</b> layers. Program goals for braided rope seals are to improve flow resistance and/or seal resilience. To that end, the current report studies the test results of: baseline and modified hybrid seals; two stage hybrid and two stage all-ceramic seal configurations; and single stage hybrid and single stage all-ceramic seal configurations for a range of seal crush conditions. Hybrid seal modifications include increasing the sheath braid angle and core coverage. For the same percent seal cross-sectional crush, results show that increasing the hybrid seal braid angle increased seal stiffness and seal unit load, resulting in flows approximately one third of the baseline hybrid seal flows. For both hybrid and all-ceramic seals, two stage seal configurations significantly outperformed single stage configurations. Two stage seal flows were at least 30 % less than the single stage seal flows for the same seal crush. Furthermore, test results of single stage seals indicate that for both all-ceramic and hybrid seals, a specific seal crush condition exists at which minimum flows are achieved (i. e. increasing seal crush beyond a certain point does not result in better flow performance). Flow results are presented for a range of pressures and temperatures from ambient to 1300 F, before and after scrubbing. Compression tests results show that for both all-ceramic and hybrid seals, seal preload and stiffness increase with seal crush, but residual seal interference remains constant...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{parameters}} that significantly affect the electrical performance of ceramic-core superconducting composite wire and tapes, which remain ambiguous and require more labor on their optimization. BSCCO 2212 {{has not been}} paid the attention and investment it deserves. In this regard, all optimization efforts were made for BSCCO 2223. In our work, a practical and inexpensive manufacturing method, thermally and mechanically optimized for Pb doped BiSrCaCuO 2212 superconducting multifilament (38 filaments) wires and tapes, was successfully employed. Optimized parameters can be classified under material, mechanical (deformation) and heat treatment (thermal) subgroups. Parameters involved with materials included investigation of deformation behavior of two different sheath metals; pure silver and 0. 02 % magnesia dispersion reinforced silver alloy. Pb doped BiSrCaCuO 2212 ceramic superconductor powder, the other source of material related parameters, was synthesized following the "Thermal Co-decomposition or Wet Mix" method. Fabrication of mono and multifilament wires with Oxide Powder in Tube (OPIT) method followed next. Optimization of drawing deformation was practiced to achieve the best ceramic grain alignment and smoother <b>ceramic</b> powder core/metal <b>sheath</b> interface {{in order to avoid}} "sausaging" in wires. Rolling of the wire products into tapes by following different deformation regimes was the other manufacturing stage of the project. Variable and constant reduction-per-pass deformation paths were employed to reveal their effects on our composites with distinct sheath material and filament formation. The search for the best (optimum) heat treatment schedule for our Bi 2212 superconductor composites, a modified version of "step solidification partial melting", was employed successfully. A solution through tried recipes for the bubbling problem that occurred with our tapes was also addressed. Electrical performance tests of fully reacted wires were carried out in our laboratory and very promising results were attained...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the increase in}} surface energy of substrates by their treatment with gas composition generated in plasmas of DBD (Dielectric Barrier Discharge) in O 2 admixed with N 2. Operating gas dissociation and excitation was occurred in plasmas developed in two types of reactors of capacitively-coupled dielectric barrier configurations: coaxial cylindrical, and flat rectangular. The coaxial cylindrical type comprised an inner cylindrical electrode encapsulated in a <b>ceramic</b> <b>sheath</b> installed coaxially inside a cylindrical ceramic (quartz) tube passing through an annular outer electrode. Components of the flat rectangular type were a flat ceramic tube of a narrow rectangular cross section supplied with two flat electrodes mounted against one another outside of the long parallel walls of this tube. The operating gas, mixture of N 2 and O 2, was flowing in a completely insulated discharge gap formed between insulated electrodes of the devices with an average velocity of gas inlet of about 7 to 9 m/s. Dielectric barrier discharge plasma was excited in the operating gaps with a bipolar pulse voltage of about 6 kV for 2 ms at 50 kHz repetition rate applied to the electrodes of the coaxial device, and of about 14 kV for 7 ms at 30 kHz repetition rate for the flat linear device. A lifetime of excited to the 2 s 22 p 4 (1 S 0) state in DBD plasma and streaming to the surfaces with a gas flow atomic oxygen, responsible presumably for treating surfaces, exceeded 10 ms in certain cases, that simplified its separation from DBD plasma and delivery to substrates. As it was found in particular, surfaces of glass and some of polymers revealed significant enhancement in wettability after treatment...|$|E
