Polytropic compression will use a value of n between 0 (a constant-pressure process) and infinity (a constant volume process). For the typical case where an effort is made to cool the gas compressed by an approximately adiabatic process, the value of n will be between 1 and k.|$|E

Actual tests of a Tesla steam turbine at the Westinghouse works showed a steam rate of 38 pounds per horsepower-hour, corresponding to a turbine efficiency in the range of 20%, while contemporary steam turbines could often achieve turbine efficiencies of well over 50%. The thermodynamic efficiency is a measure of how well it performs compared to an isentropic case. It is the ratio of the ideal to the actual work input/output.

Efforts to improve these efficiencies have specifically or concurrently concentrated in three areas: (1) modifying the working cycle, (2) increasing turbine inlet temperature, and (3) enhancing the performance of cycle components. Recently, developments in material science allow using turbine inlet temperatures up to 1, 500 °C (i.e., general electric uses a turbine inlet temperature of 1, 425 °C). Also, continuous modifications of Brayton cycle to include regeneration [1, 2], isothermal heat addition [3, 4, 5, 6], intercooled compression [7, 8], reheat expansion [9, 10], and combined modifications [11, 12, 13, 14] have resulted in practically doubling the <b>cycle</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> This is because intercooling and reheating result in decreasing the average temperature at which heat is added.

The maximal efficiency estimates returned by the model are comparable in accuracy and precision to both the golden standard of serial dilution and other single reaction efficiency methods.
