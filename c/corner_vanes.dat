40|$|Fan {{silencers}} with low-pressure drop {{have been}} designed and installed in the NASA Ames 7 - by 10 -Foot Wind Tunnel No. 1. The silencers are composed of an absorbent lining flush with the wind-tunnel walls upstream of the fan and an absorbent splitter in the duct downstream of the fan. An acoustical insertion loss of 4 to 12 dB was measured between 100 and 1000 Hz. High-frequency performance of the silencers was reduced by test-section noise and by <b>corner</b> <b>vanes</b> which turned the sound waves so they followed the duct axis. Sound below 1. 2 kHz diffracted around the 305 -mm-long vanes and impinged on acoustically absorbent corner walls. Wind-tunnel flow losses are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{the size}} and {{complexity}} of the 5 -metre wind tunnel, its use raises problems of erosion of wind-tunnel models which have not been encountered with other low-speed facilities. Two methods for removal of small particles have been investigated. They are: i) the use of fine mesh fabric screens as filters; and (ii) by aerodynamic separation at the corners of the tunnel circuit. (The latter investigation involves the computation of the trajectories of particles in a turning flow.) The results show that particles smaller than 0. 3 m cannot be filtered out within the practicable pressure drop limitations of the tunnel circuit. However, small particles have a sufficiently high probability of striking the concave surfaces of the <b>corner</b> <b>vanes</b> that if grease or some other retentive material were applied the particles could be quickly removed from the circuit. This latter method is being kept in reserve for the 5 [...] etre tunnel, since physical means such as sweeping and vacuum cleaning have so far seemed to give adequate results...|$|E
40|$|Rehabilitation of the Altitude Wind Tunnel {{includes}} {{the need for}} new <b>corner</b> turning <b>vanes</b> to match its upgraded performance. The design and experimental performance results from a 0. 1 -full scale model of the highest speed corner (M = 0. 35) are presented and discussed along with some two dimensional inviscid analyses of two vaned <b>corners.</b> With a <b>vane</b> designed by an inverse two dimensional technique, the overall corner loss was about 12 % of the inlet dynamic pressure of which about 4 % was caused by vane skin friction. Comparable values with a conventionally designed circular arc vane were about 14 % overall with about 7 % due to skin friction...|$|R
50|$|His next {{fight was}} against veteran Saúl Román in a WBC semi-final title {{eliminator}} for the vacant WBC Silver Light Middleweight Championship. The bout was on June 4, 2011 in HBO's televised {{portion of the}} Julio César Chávez, Jr. vs. Sebastian Zbik undercard. Román knocked Vanes down {{in the first round}} and gave him trouble in the next two. Martirosyan came back in the fourth and fifth. When the seventh round began, Román <b>cornered</b> <b>Vanes</b> against the ropes and landed several blows. Vanes may have caught Román just in time from being stopped. In the same round, Vanes trapped Román against the ropes and knocked him down. After Román got up, Vanes landed a hard right hook on his chin and followed up with a barrage of blows while Román was leaning on the ropes, causing the fight to be stopped and turning what seemed to be near-defeat into victory.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) DeNOx is {{the main}} flue gas {{denitrification}} technology, and the efficiency of SCR DeNOx system depends on whether the flue gas and ammonia distributions of the velocity and concentration fields are uniform in the reactor. Combined with the porous medium model and component transport equations, the numerical simulations were carried on for the SCR system of the 1000 MW coal-fired station, and the velocity fields and concentration fields in different cases were obtained. The results showed that: the <b>corner</b> <b>vane</b> cascades and rectifier grills installed, the non-uniformity of flue gas velocity is less than 15 % at the catalyst inlet within the reactor. Under {{the premise of the}} best flow field, the vortex mixers can ensure the full blending of the ammonia and flue gas in the reactor. The reliability of numerical simulation is verified through the cold model test, and then the design of the SCR system is guided effectively by the numerical simulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{design of}} airborne probes for {{the capture of}} air and aerosols is discussed. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} key parameters that affect proper sampling, such as inlet-lip design, internal duct components for low pressure drop, and exhaust geometry. Inlet designs that avoid sonic flow conditions on the lip and flow separation in the duct are shown. Cross-stream velocities of aerosols are expressed in terms of droplet density and diameter. Flow curvature, which can cause aerosols to cross streamlines and impact on probe walls, can be minimized by means of a proper inlet shape and proper probe orientation, and by avoiding bends upstream of the test section. A NASA panel code called PMARC was used successfully to compute streamlines around aircraft and probes, as well as to compute to local velocity and pressure distributions in inlets. A NACA 1 -series inlet with modified lip radius was used for the airborne capture of stratospheric chlorine monoxide at high altitude and high flight speed. The device has a two-stage inlet that decelerates the inflow with little disturbance to the flow through the test section. Diffuser design, exhaust hood design, valve loss, and <b>corner</b> <b>vane</b> geometry are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} studies were {{conducted}} to determine the existing flow quality in the NASA Lewis 8 by 6 Foot Supersonic/ 9 by 15 Foot Low speed Wind Tunnel. The information gathered from these studies {{was used to determine}} the types and designs of flow manipulators which can be installed to improve overall tunnel flow quality and efficiency. Such manipulators include honeycomb flow straighteners, turbulence reduction screens, <b>corner</b> turning <b>vanes,</b> and acoustic treatments. The types of measurements, instrumentation, and results obtained from experiments conducted at several locations throughout the tunnel loop are described...|$|R
40|$|A 45 deg-honeycomb flow manipulator, mounted {{parallel}} to the <b>corner</b> turning <b>vanes,</b> was investigated for improving the flow quality in wind tunnels {{with little or no}} settling chamber length. This manipulator permits increased turbulence decay distance in comparison to a conventional honeycomb arrangement. The resulting turbulence levels in a wind tunnel using the 45 deg-honeycomb are comparable to those obtained using a conventional honeycomb, but only when a 45 deg-screen is mounted immediately downstream of the honeycomb and when some separation distance between the turning vanes and the 45 deg-honeycomb is provided for adequate decay of the turning vane wakes (at least twice the spacing between the turning vanes) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of using a}} 45 deg-honeycomb for improving the flow quality in wind tunnels was investigated. The results of the experiments indicate that the turbulence levels in a wind tunnel using the 45 deg-honeycomb would be comparable to those obtainable using a conventional honeycomb, i. e., a honeycomb which is positioned normal to the mean flow in the settling chamber. However, this is true only when a 45 deg-screen is mounted immediately downstream of the honeycomb, and when some distance is provided between the trailing edges of the <b>corner</b> turning <b>vanes</b> and the upstream side of the 45 deg-honeycomb. This distance is required for adequate decay of the turning-vane wakes, thereby providing a reasonably uniform mean flow entering the honeycomb. Results demonstrate that this distance {{should be at least}} twice the spacing between the turning vanes. Even though the resulting turbulence intensity is the same downstream of both the 45 deg-honeycomb and the conventional honeycomb, {{there would have to be}} a significant improvement in the test-section turbulence intensity using the 45 deg-honeycomb to justify the additional expense in fabricating and installing this type of honeycomb...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} turning vane {{airfoils}} (a controlled-diffusion shape and a circular arc shape) {{have been evaluated}} in the high-speed and fan-drive corners of a 0. 1 -scale model of NASA Lewis Research Center's proposed Altitude Wind Tunnel. The high-speed corner was evaluated with and without a simulated engine exhaust removal scoop. The fan-drive corner was evaluated with and without the high-speed corner. Flow surveys of pressure and flow angle were taken for both the <b>corners</b> and the <b>vanes</b> to determine their respective losses. The two-dimensional vane losses were low; however, the overall corner losses were higher because three-dimensional flow was generated by the complex geometry resulting from the turning vanes intersecting the end wall. The three-dimensional effects were especially pronounced in the outer region of the circular corner...|$|R
40|$|Progress {{reports were}} issued on the {{following}} experiments: (1) low Reynolds number flow phenomenon of periodic vortex shedding in the wake behind a cylinder as studied by applying the hot wire anemometer technique of flow measurement. The downstream diffusion of these shed vortices was of prime concern. An evaluation {{of the performance of}} the hot wire at low Reynolds number is also considered. (2) A brief examination of the back sections of the Wright Brothers wind tunnel circuits were conducted to establish whether or not gross flow deviations were present at <b>corners,</b> or turning <b>vane</b> regions. A calibration of the test sections was done. (3) The attractiveness of using rembedded grids for airfoil calculations modeled by the Euler equations was explored. These calculations were extended to C-type grids and then to Navier-Stokes calculations...|$|R
40|$|Summary. [...] The {{tests were}} made by {{replacing}} the existing centre six thick vanes at the first corner of the 4 x 3 -ft wind tunnel by vanes of sheet metal. The thin vanes reduced the-corner loss, estimated from a wake traverse behind one vane, without any deterioration in outflow, and are therefore recommended for use in future wind tunnels. 1. Introducgion. [...] The cascades fitted {{at the corners of}} return-circuit wind-tunnels are usually composed of vanes of an appreciable thickness, giving passages of approximately constant area round the <b>corners.</b> Such <b>vanes,</b> whilst quite satisfactory in operation, are difficult and expensive to construct. A need, therefore, was felt for further information on the use of thin vanes made of sheet metal, under actual operating conditions, tests 1, 2 at low Reynolds number having shown that there is little difference in the corner loss for thick and thin vanes. Accordingly, comparative tests were made on thick and thin vanes fitted at the first corner of the 4 x 3 -ft wind tunneP. Originally, thick vanes (Fig. la) were fitted, there being fourteen vanes of gap: chord ratio 0. 25. The six centre thick vanes were replaced by sheet metal vanes following the lines of the convex surface of the thick ones (Fig. lb). The tunnel section approaching the corner is circular and has a diameter of 6 ft...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on design {{simulations}} by the means of commercial software for a low speed circuit wind tunnel with an open test section, recently built at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Mechatronics and Materials Technology at THM University of Applied Sciences in Friedberg. The proposed wind tunnel has a test section with cross sectional area of 1 X 1 m 2 and a length of 1. 6 m. The maximum achievable speed is about 50 m/s with empty test section. The simulation had the target to propose and to verify various geometries - test chamber, tunnel contraction, diffuser etc. as well the tunnel <b>corner</b> including the <b>vanes.</b> In addition, {{the influence of the}} vanes number and their shape on the ventilator power needed and the flow velocity uniformity as well, have been subjects of the investigation. Also the ventilator type (rotational segment) impact on the flow pattern within the operational area has been scrutinized...|$|R
