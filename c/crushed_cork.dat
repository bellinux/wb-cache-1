50|$|Tipp <b>crushed</b> <b>Cork</b> in {{the provincial}} final again in 1968, giving Gaynor his third Munster title. For the fourth time that decade Tipperary faced Wexford in the {{championship}} decider, however, the Munster champions were now in terminal decline and surrendered an eight-point lead at half-time giving Wexford a 5-8 to 3-12 victory.|$|E
50|$|The helmet reduced {{casualties}} but {{was criticized}} by General Herbert Plumer {{on the grounds}} that it was too shallow, too reflective, its rim was too sharp, and its lining was too slippery. These criticisms were addressed in the Mark I model helmet of 1916 which had a separate folded rim, a two-part liner, and matte khaki paint finished with sand, sawdust, or <b>crushed</b> <b>cork</b> to give a dull, non-reflective appearance.|$|E
50|$|To cork a bat, a hole {{approximately}} 1/2-inch (12.5 mm) {{in diameter}} is drilled {{down through the}} thick end of the bat roughly six inches deep. <b>Crushed</b> <b>cork,</b> bouncy ball, sawdust, or other similar material is compacted into the hole and the end is typically patched up with glue and sawdust. However, this weakens the bat's structural integrity and makes it more susceptible to breakage, even more so if the cork is placed beyond roughly six inches into the bat. Corked bats are typically discovered when they break during play.|$|E
5000|$|Fitzhenry's side {{lost out}} to Kilkenny in the Leinster finals of 2002 and 2003, however, {{they ended up}} in the All-Ireland semi-final in the latter year. In that game Wexford drew with Cork in an {{exciting}} challenge, however, <b>Cork</b> <b>crushed</b> Wexford in the replay.|$|R
6000|$|I am {{naturally}} of a superstitious cast, {{and as soon}} as my wonder-scared imagination regained its consciousness, {{and resumed}} its functions, I cast about what this mania of yours might portend. My foreboding ideas had the wide stretch of possibility; and several events, great in their magnitude, and important in their consequences, occurred to my fancy. The downfall of the conclave, or the <b>crushing</b> of the <b>Cork</b> rumps; a ducal coronet to Lord George Gordon, and the protestant interest; or St Peter's keys to .....|$|R
5000|$|... 1982 was the {{beginning}} of one of the blackest periods in Waterford’s hurling history. An unbeaten run in the league stage of the National League was ended only after a replay in the semi-final by Kilkenny, and a one-point over defending Munster champions Limerick in the semi-final raised hopes that a 23-year wait for Munster success was about to come to an end. But in their first Munster final appearance since 1966, Waterford were humiliated by Cork, losing by 5-31 (46) to 3-6 (15). There was individual reward in the form of All Star awards for Jim Greene and John Galvin (his second), but the disappointment of that year was compounded in 1983. Having overcome a young Tipperary side seeking their county’s first championship win in eight years, Waterford were back in the Munster final only to be <b>crushed</b> by <b>Cork</b> again, 3-22 (31) to 0-12.|$|R
5000|$|The Brodie helmet reduced {{casualties}} but {{was criticized}} by General Herbert Plumer {{on the grounds}} that it was too shallow and too light-reflective, its rim was too sharp, and its lining was too slippery. These criticisms were addressed in the Mark I model helmet of 1916, which had a separate folded rim, a two-part liner and matte khaki paint finished with sand, sawdust, or <b>crushed</b> <b>cork</b> to give a dull, non-reflective appearance. In 1917, the liner was modified to include a rubber cushion to make it more comfortable, although this was not adopted for the M1917. Towards the end of the war, helmets were often painted with unit insignia. These are often called [...] "parade helmets" [...] by collectors.|$|E
50|$|In 1943 {{the senior}} hurling {{championship}} faced {{a number of}} problems. Chief amongst these {{was the fact that}} the Emergency forced the All-Ireland minor and junior to be cancelled, resulting in the Ulster teams having no hurling competition. Because of this the Ulster champions were allowed to participate in the All-Ireland senior championship for the first time since 1925. That year Armstrong collected his second Ulster title before lining out against Galway in the All-Ireland quarter-final. That game, played at Corrigan Park in Belfast, threw up a surprise result as Antrim defeated Galway by 7-0 to 6-2. This allowed Armstrong's side to advance to an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Kilkenny and, once again, the game was played at Corrigan Park. It was another historic win for Antrim as 'the Cats' were defeated by 3-3 to 1-6. It was the biggest shock in the history of the All-Ireland championship. For the first time in history a team from Ulster qualified to play in the All-Ireland final. Cork, the champions of the previous two years, provided the opposition on this occasion. Before the game, the economic realities of the time surfaced. Jimmy Walsh, the Antrim captain presented a quantity of butter to the Cork captain, Seán Condon, who in turn presented his counterpart with a quantity of tea. Once the pre-match festivities were over the game began and a rout ensued. <b>Cork</b> <b>crushed</b> Antrim by 5-16 to 0-4, one of the biggest deficits in the history of the championship.|$|R
5000|$|... 1965-Tipperary {{had an easy}} {{victory over}} Clare in the 1965 Munster semi-final at Limerick. It was a very mediocre game that saw a crafty and {{experienced}} Tipperary side pitted against a fast and enthusiastic but immature opposition. They were ahead by 2-4 to 0-1 at the break, and had eleven points to spare at the final whistle on a scoreline of 5-8 to 3-3.Tipperary inflicted a <b>crushing</b> defeat on <b>Cork</b> in the Munster final at Limerick. The winners were in front by 2-4 to 0-4 at the interval, and held Cork to {{a point in the}} second half. It was Tipperary's twenty-ninth Munster senior hurling title and brought them level with Cork.That this Tipperary team was one of the finest hurling combinations of all time was proven in the All-Ireland final on 5 September, when they defeated Wexford by 2-16 to 0-10. The victory, before 70,000 spectators, gave Tipperary their twenty-first All-Ireland title, and their fourth in five years. For John Doyle it was a memorable occasion as it brought him his eighth medal, which put him on a par with Christy Ring. Tipperary were in command all through the game and the foundation of the success was an impregnable inner line of defence, and two goals by Sean McLoughlin {{in the first quarter of}} the game. Tipperary led by 2-5 to 0-6 at halftime and at no time in the game was their victory in doubt.|$|R
