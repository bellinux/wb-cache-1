This article will examine actual changes in nomadic livestock management, and its characteristics. Main factors {{of changes in}} nomadic livestock management during the settlement process are 1) pastoral management style which {{is defined by the}} natural condition of a given pastoral area and 2) the ability of the nomadic livestock management body. The livestock production base and social infrastructure plays rather a minor role for the settlement. The following changes occurred because of settlement. First, the traditional nomadic livestock production method, which requires seasonal movement, was replaced with lesser movement of herds and <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> became part of the nomadic life. Nomads started to build fences for winter which decreased the number of nomads and nomadic families who move seasonally. Traditional nomadic <b>production</b> <b>groups,</b> which consisted of several families, were dismantled.

A telephone survey was conducted using two groups, one selected from <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> clubs that had been organized {{for more than five years}} and the other a stratified random sample of non-club farmers in the surrounding area to the clubs. The questionnaire was designed to obtain information about innovative cropping practices, as well as demographic data, personal characteristics and communication behavior. A total of 38 <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> club members and 28 non-club farmers were contacted between April 22 and May 10, 1991. 	The results of the study found that the characteristics exhibited by <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> club members were similar to those outlined in the adoptiondiffusion theory for early adopters. Therefore <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> club members fit into the adoption-diffusion process as early adopters. Crop clubs use demonstrations as a way of introducing new innovations to their club members. Both groups indicated that they used neighbors often as a source of information and therefore, <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> club members likely transfer information to others through this and other channels.

40|$|We analyse the {{adoption}} of agri-environmental programmes, i. e. extensive and organic <b>crop</b> <b>production,</b> in Switzerland for the years 2008 and 2009. While extensive <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> is adopted by about 60 per cent of all eligible farms, {{the adoption}} of organic <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> is very limited. Using logistic regressions we find that farms located in adverse production conditions (e. g. at higher altitudes) {{are more likely to}} be adopters of extensive <b>crop</b> <b>production.</b> Moreover, our results show that the probability of adopting organic production decreases with increasing specialisation in <b>crop</b> <b>production.</b> We find that organic producers tend to be slightly younger and better educated than other farmers. However, no differences in farmers’ age and education are found between non-adopters and extensive crop producers. This shows that, in general, the non-adoption of agri-environmental programmes in Switzerland is not primarily an educational problem. Moreover, we find that land tenure has no influence on {{the adoption of}} agri-environmental <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> schemes. Thus, large shares of rented land do not limit the adoption of agri-environmental programmes.

40|$|Though {{agriculture}} is the predominant occupation in Northern Ghana, {{the relationship between}} rainfall variability and <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> appears {{not to have been}} adequately investigated in the area. <b>Crop</b> <b>production</b> is largely characterized by smallholder subsistence farmers who depend solely on highly unpredictable and irregular seasonal rainfall. In recent times, rainfall variability has led to numerous incidences of drought and floods. This phenomenon has the potential to adversely affect <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> and food security in the area. This study analyses inter- and intra-annual variability of rainfall so as to identify the relationship between rainfall variability and <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> in a representative district of Northern Ghana. Available monthly rainfall data for 33 years (1980 - 2012) recorded at Babile station of the district was analyzed for seasonal and annual variability using the coefficient of variation (CV) and the precipitation concentration index (PCI). Total annual quantity of <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> data on main crops (i. e. maize, millet, sorghum, groundnut and cowpea) was used. The available data covered a period of 21 years (1992 - 2012). To verify the influence of rainfall variability on <b>crop</b> <b>production,</b> correlation analysis was conducted. Although the results showed moderate seasonal rainfall distribution, (i. e. PCI> 11), the inter-seasonal and inter-annual rainfall variability (CV= 0. 19 and C= 0. 18 respectively) were moderate/less erratic. The results point to a negative correlation between annual rainfall and <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> for maize, millet, sorghum, groundnut and cowpea. At seasonal level sorghum, millet and groundnut showed negative correlation while maize and cowpea showed positive correlation. These results also point to a need for further studies to determine the influence of rainfall on arable land use and the periods of occurrence of drought in the study area.

40|$|Abstract Agriculture is {{the major}} means of {{livelihood}} for the rural people of Ghana. It is also the backbone of national economies, {{the main source of}} foreign exchange and the most important source of employment. It is not surprising that in the 1980 ’s the paradigm shifted towards agricultural finance in developing countries. Microfinance became the alternative to the fall-out of government intervention to alleviate poverty through credit support to rural farmers. However, till now, no study has been conducted to ascertain the impact of microfinance on <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> in Ghana. This paper therefore investigates the impact of microfinance on <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> in Ghana with specific reference to the East Mamprusi District (EMD) of Ghana. The paper employed the quantitative method approach. The sample size that was used in the study was hundred (100) respondents who were drawn from the list of farmers in the district who have accessed microfinance. The results show that there is a significant relationship between microfinance and <b>crop</b> <b>production.</b> Also, consistent with the perceptive views of the respondents on the impact of microcredit on <b>crop</b> <b>production,</b> the regression result showed that a GH¢ 1 increase in microcredit to the farmers would increase <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> by more than one-third (0. 314) of a bag.
