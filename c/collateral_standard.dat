50|$|For example, IEC 60601-1-9 for Environmentally Conscious Design of Medical Electrical Equipment {{published}} July 2007 is a <b>collateral</b> <b>standard</b> to IEC 60601-1 and {{has been}} developed drawing on extensive practical experience at Philips Medical Systems and Siemens Medical Solutions. The Part 9 standard asks manufacturers of medical devices to consider {{the environmental impacts of}} their devices throughout the product's entire life cycle and to minimize these where possible. The standard also requires that the manufacturer provide information to the user on how to use the product in the most environmentally sensitive way.The USA, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand have not yet set transition dates for their national versions of this latest edition 60601-1, but the national versions published to date do contain the requirement to also conform with IEC 60601-1-9. However, the European version (EN 60601-1:2006) requires compliance with the new IEC 60601-1-9 <b>collateral</b> <b>standard</b> by September 2009.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the recent}} {{publication}} of the US national version of the <b>collateral</b> <b>standard</b> for products intended for home use, ANSI/AAMI HA60601-1-11, {{the application of the}} standard does not apply to the nursing home environment. In the United States, nursing facilities are considered to be environments providing professional healthcare. The American version of this <b>collateral</b> <b>standard</b> also places greater emphasis on a requirement that states that “inspection of the usability engineering file reinforce that the usability engineering process is necessary for validation of the instructions for use.” Devices typically mandated to use the new standard include oxygen concentrators, body-worn nerve and muscle stimulators, beds, sleep apnea monitors, and associated battery chargers prescribed for use at home. Although In Vitro Diagnostic devices such as blood glucose meters are being used by patients at home, the standard does not apply, as these devices remain {{under the jurisdiction of the}} more lenient IEC 61010 series.|$|E

The unprecedented emergency actions of the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and the Bank of England are analyzed in terms of Walter Bagehot's traditional Lender of Last Resort doctrine. The central banks' actions are compared to identify the extensions and paint a general picture of the modern and much more comprehensive Lender of Last Resort function, which includes provision of liquidity and collateral, lowering interest rates and expansionary monetary policy, loosening <b>collateral</b> <b>standards,</b> supporting critical institutions, opening special liquidity facilities that target specific markets or groups of agents, and becoming market maker of last resort and buyer of last resort.

40|$|Fortran {{has largely}} enjoyed {{prominence}} {{for the past}} few decades as the computer programming language of choice for numerically intensive scientific, engineering, and process control applications. Fortran's well understood static language syntax has allowed resulting parsers and compiler optimizing technologies to often generate among the most efficient and fastest run-time executables, particularly on high-end scalar and vector supercomputers. Computing architectures and paradigms have changed considerably since the last ANSI/ISO Fortran release in 1978, and while FORTRAN 77 has more than survived, it's aged features provide only partial functionality for today's demanding computing environments. The simple block procedural languages have been necessarily evolving, or giving way, to specialized supercomputing, network resource, and object-oriented paradigms. To address these new computing demands, ANSI has worked for the last 12 -years with three international public reviews to deliver Fortran 90. Fortran 90 has superseded and replaced ISO FORTRAN 77 internationally as the sole Fortran standard; while in the US, Fortran 90 is expected to be adopted as the ANSI standard this summer, coexisting with ANSI FORTRAN 77 until at least 1996. The development path and current state of Fortran will be briefly described highlighting the many new Fortran 90 syntactic and semantic additions which support (among others) : free form source; array syntax; new control structures; modules and interfaces; pointers; derived data types; dynamic memory; enhanced I/O; operator overloading; data abstraction; user optional arguments; new intrinsics for array, bit manipulation, and system inquiry; and enhanced portability through better generic control of underlying system arithmetic models. Examples from dynamical astronomy, signal and image processing will attempt to illustrate Fortran 90 's applicability to today's general scalar, vector, and parallel scientific and engineering requirements and object oriented programming paradigms. Time permitting, current work proceeding on the future development of Fortran 2000 and <b>collateral</b> <b>standards</b> will be introduced...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose : Although {{collateral}} vessels {{have been}} shown to be an important prognostic factor in acute ischemic stroke, patients with lack of <b>collaterals</b> on <b>standard</b> imaging techniques may still have good clinical outcome. We postulate that in these cases collateral vessels are present though not visible on standard imaging techniques that are based on a single time frame. Methods : This study included 40 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke with a large-vessel occlusion. Standard computed tomography angiography (CTA, single time frame) and CT perfusion (multiple time frames) were obtained at admission and timing-invariant (TI) -CTA was created from the CT perfusion data. Clinical outcome data (modified Rankin Scale) were assessed at 3 -month follow-up. Four experienced observers independently assessed collateral status twice on both standard CTA and TI-CTA in an independent, blinded, randomized manner. Collateral status was rated as good if ≥ 50...|$|R

At the close of trading the average was up 936 points, a record climb, up 11%, closing above 9,000 at 9,387. After announcement in France of a 320 billion euro rescue and guarantee plan, French CAC40 rose by 11.18% within the day. Germany announced a €400 billion plan. On Monday the International Monetary Fund offered possible technical and financial aid to Hungary which has suffered during the crisis due to the flight of investors to euro, Swiss franc, and dollar denominated investments. As {{in the rest of the}} world, on Monday stock prices rose on the Hungarian exchange and pressure on the national currency, the forint eased. The forint has dropped 30% against the dollar since July.The prime minister of Spain, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, announced that Spain would provide up to €100 billion of guarantees for new debt issued by commercial banks in 2008. This plan followed a meeting at the eurozone summit over the weekend to try to develop a coordinated effort to combat the credit crisis. The UK government started the nationalization process by injecting £37 billion in the nation’s three largest banks. The UK government would end up owning a majority share in the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and over a 40% share in Lloyds and HBOS. In return for the bailout, the banks agreed to cancel dividend payments until the loans are repaid, have board members appointed by the Treasury, and limit executive pay. The European Central Bank attempted to revive credit market by weekly injections of unlimited euro funds at an interest rate of 3.75%. The ECB president, Jean-Claude Trichet, was also contemplating relaxing the <b>collateral</b> <b>standards</b> to make the funds more accessible to banks. Following its European partners, Italy pledged to intervene as necessary to prevent any bank failures in its country. Finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, said Italy would guarantee new bank bonds of up to 5 years until the end of 2009 and the Bank of Italy would provide €40 billion in treasury bills to banks to refinance inferior assets that can not be currently used as collateral. In coordination with other eurozone countries, the Dutch government announced that it would guarantee interbank lending up to €200 billion. This followed the set up of a €20 billion Dutch fund to help recapitalize banks and insurers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model in}} which a firm {{with a degree of}} R and D specialization raises external funds to develop a two-period project that involves some non-verifiable returns (R and D-type of project). Taking into account a possible opportunistic behavior by the manager, we find out that the optimal firm's debt equity ratio is negatively related to the firm's degree of R and D specialization, its internal funds, and the output generated by the R and D project. Moreover, the expected R and D output of the firm is related negatively to the firm's leverage and positively to the firm's degree of R and D specialization as well as the amount of internal funds. The novelty of this work is to derive these results from strategic default consideration of the managers of firms specialized in R and D investments, as opposed to the <b>standard</b> <b>collateral</b> arguments concerning debt financing. This has a consequence of a lower growth of the firm's debt-equity ratio once we compare firms specialized on R and D investments with others non specialized in these activities. We confirm our main theoretical findings making use of a Spanish data set of manufacturing firms during the period 1990 - 94...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{establish}} a non-invasive method for quantitative analysis of pulmonary perfusion {{in patients with}} bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis (BCPA) and sources of pulsatile blood flow. The method should quantify left to right lung flow ratio and relative contribution of BCPA and sources of pulsatile blood flow to perfusion of each lung. DESIGN: A pilot study using radionuclide angiocardiography for quantitative analysis and for visualisation of cavo-caval <b>collaterals.</b> No criterion <b>standard</b> is available. SETTING: Tertiary care centre, ambulatory and hospital inpatient care. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 18 patients with BCPA and sources of pulsatile blood flow. RESULTS: In eight patients (44 %) cavocaval collaterals prevented quantitative analysis. In 10 patients without cavo-caval collaterals, BCPA provided 42. 3 (SEM 3. 4) % of total pulmonary blood flow. From the total BCPA flow, 67. 2 (4. 3) % was directed to the ipsilateral lung. This lung received only 16. 5 (3. 3) % of all the blood from sources of pulsatile blood flow. The {{blood flow to the}} lung at the side of BCPA accounted for 35. 3 (1. 7) % of the total pulmonary blood flow. CONCLUSIONS: Radionuclide angiocardiography allows the quantitative analysis of pulmonary blood supply in BCPA with sources of pulsatile blood flow except in patients with cavo-caval collaterals or bilateral BCPA. Non-pulsatile flow from BCPA is mainly directed to the ipsilateral lung, whereas pulsatile flow to the contralateral lung. Total perfusion of the ipsilateral lung is less than the perfusion of the contralateral lung...|$|R
40|$|Searching for funding, SMEs' {{managers}} face various obstacles {{arising from}} information asymmetry, lack of experience, severe market conditions, and insufficient or unsatisfactory collaterals for banks (OECD 2006; Badulescu and Badulescu 2010; OECD 2000 and 2004; Lin and Sun 2006; Toivanen and Cresy, 2000). The collateral issue is extensively discussed in literature - preventing moral hazard, the alignment the interests (Stiglitz and Weiss 1981 : 393 - 410; Chan and Thakor 1987 : 345 - 363; Jiménez and Saurina 2004), {{a means to}} discipline the borrowers behaviour (ex post) given {{the existence of a}} credible threat (Aghion and Bolton 1992 : 473 - 494), or even banking behaviour on the market (Manove et al. 2001 : 726 - 744, Argentiero 2009). In the same time we find that the perception of firms, revealed by National Bank of Romania (NBR 2010) survey data, show that banks still use the collateral as a measure of pressure, in special in crisis times. For an important part of managers, the bank increased the level of required collateral for existing, renewing or new credits, asking for new covenants, revealing a paradox of crisis time: while the bank loans remained the favourite method of external financing needs of business, the banks often reduce their availability. Although the bank loan remains the favorite mean to support the growth ambitions, the higher level of collateral or lending costs are seen as principal obstacles by the majority of manager in EU. According to NBR survey, the influence of risk factors related to collateral had a climax at the end of 2008 and 2009, when the banks have tightened the requirement for loan guarantee.

Following the European trend in straightening the credit conditions, Romanian market had a more pregnant evolution with a rapid deterioration of these conditions during the second and the third quarter of 2008. In general terms, the seeking for higher percentage of coverage with real estate collaterals, paradoxically, makes banks more vulnerable, given their pro-cyclical behaviour, feeding the real estate market crisis.
