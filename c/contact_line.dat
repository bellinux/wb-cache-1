When a <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> advances, covering more of the surface with liquid, the contact angle is increased and generally {{is related to the}} velocity of the <b>contact</b> <b>line.</b> If the velocity of a <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> is increased without bound, the contact angle increases, and as it approaches 180°, the gas phase will become entrained in a thin layer between the liquid and solid. This is a kinetic nonequilibrium effect which results from the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> moving at such a high speed that complete wetting cannot occur.|$|E
5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of a <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E

Although the equilibrium shapes of simple droplets on fibers are well established, the situation becomes more complex for compound fluidic systems.

40|$|International audienceBy {{performing}} near-critical fluid {{experiments in}} the weightlessness of an orbiting space vehicle, we have suppressed buoyancy-driven flows and gravitational constraints on the liquid-gas interface of a large gas bubble. At equilibrium, the liquid completely wets {{the walls of a}} cylindrical cell, and the bubble is pushed to the sidewall. In these experiments the system's temperature T is increased at a constant rate past the critical temperature Tc, pushing it slightly out of equilibrium. The wetting film shows a large mechanical response to this heating, including <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> that recede on a solid surface and a spreading bubble. Near Tc, the receding <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> make the entire bubble appear to spread along the copper sidewall. The spreading bubble is a manifestation of the boiling crisis near the critical point. We present quantitative data of the receding <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> that are observed prior to the near-critical boiling crisis.

40|$|The dynamic {{characteristics}} of <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> on inclined micropillared surfaces were investigated in this paper.

Droplet layers formed during droplet sliding were left behind and evaporated quickly and disappeared. Based on these characteristics, the comparison of experimental data with theoretical models was discussed. It was found that energy barrier {{played an important role}} in analyzing wetting characteristics.

40|$|The {{steady flow}} of a slowly varying rivulet with {{prescribed}} flux in the azimuthal direction round a large stationary horizontal cylinder subject to a prescribed uniform azimuthal surface shear stress is investigated. In particular, {{we focus on the}} case where the volume flux is downwards but the shear stress is upwards, for which there is always a solution corresponding to a rivulet flowing down at least part of one side of the cylinder. We consider both a rivulet with constant non-zero contact angle but slowly varying width (i. e. de-pinned <b>contact</b> <b>lines)</b> and a rivulet with constant width but slowly varying contact angle (i. e. pinned <b>contact</b> <b>lines),</b> and show that they have qualitatively different behaviour. When shear is present, a rivulet with constant non-zero contact angle can never run {{all the way from the}} top to the bottom of the cylinder, and so we consider the scenario in which an infinitely wide two-dimensional film of uniform thickness covers part of the upper half of the cylinder and "breaks" into a single rivulet with constant non-zero contact angle. In contrast, a sufficiently narrow rivulet with constant width can run all the way from the top to the bottom of the cylinder, whereas a wide rivulet can do so only if its <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> de-pin, and so we consider the scenario in which the <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> of a wide rivulet de-pin on the lower half of the cylinder...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} reconstruct geological structures in three dimensions using and honouring field survey geological data. The methodology was developed to reconstruct the poly-deformed Carrara Syncline (Apuane Alps, Italy) {{in order to better}} understand the relationships regarding the structural geology of the area and the hydrogeological fluxes. In the first step, all the geological data (observed, measured and interpreted) of the study area were organized in a database using a geographical information system. The standard tools of a computer-aided design (CAD) environment were used to build geological profiles using the observed data (outcropping <b>contact</b> <b>lines)</b> extracted from the database, as well as, to create the contact surfaces via interpolation using non-uniformal rational B-spline surfaces. The intersection lines between each of these surfaces and the digital elevation model yield the model <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> (MCLs). Discrepancies between the MCLs and the corresponding outcropping <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> were analysed to further constrain the surfaces of the model. Starting from these surfaces, a voxel-based solid model was built, for storing and displaying each rock formation. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

In this context, a long-wave evolution equation describing the evaporation of an ultra-thin film is solved, focusing on nonlinear solutions in the form of <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> connecting a constant slope region to an adsorbed precursor film. First, the latter film is found to be stable to hydrodynamic disturbances, via linear stability analysis. Then, the main characteristics of evaporating <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> are analyzed, with particular attention to the sharp peak of the heat flux occurring in the transition region, which results in a microscopic (though non-negligible) contribution to the overall heat transfer. The latter is then quantified {{as a function of the}} thermal conductivity of the solid, the mass transfer resistance, the interface curvature and the Van der Waals forces, including their influence on the saturation temperature.

40|$|The {{recent study}} by Crist et al. (2004) {{attempted}} to provide pore scale insights into mechanisms responsible for controlling colloid transport in unsaturated porous media. However, because they relied on images obtained along surfaces that were open to the atmosphere, artificial evaporation resulted in 2 more critical artifacts; formation of air-water-solid (AWS) <b>contact</b> <b>lines,</b> and advection/deposition of colloids to AWS <b>contact</b> <b>lines.</b> These evaporation-related artifacts {{need to be addressed}} because they account for most of the colloid deposition at AWS <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> reported in Crist et al. (2004) [...] . As stated in Crist el al. (2004), '' [...] . the front panel was removed to avoid light reflections that obscured the view and, thus, exposed one side of the sand column to air''. Although a more recent paper (Crist et al., 2005) also presents results using the same methods and is therefore also affected by evaporation, we will restrict our present comments to Crist et al. (2004). Here, we show that removal of the front panel results in a sequence of three critical artifacts; (1) significant evaporation, (2) drying of thin films and formation of air-water-solid (AWS) <b>contact</b> <b>lines,</b> and (3) advection of colloids to AWS <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> where they are deposited. As explained below, these artifacts so drastically disturbed their system that the magnitude of their observations are not likely to occur anywhere except within the most superficial few cm of soils. Before explaining these artifacts, we note that although trapping of colloids at AWS <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> reported in Crist et al. (2004) is largely an artifact of evaporation, colloid filtration within perimeters of pendular rings is in fact a main prediction of the film straining model (Wan and Tokunaga, 1997). In that model, colloid filtration is predicted to be more efficient below a critical water saturation, when capillary connections between pendular rings become separated by adsorbed water films. In that paper we stated that ''Retardation of ideal, nonsorbing colloids can occur at two locations: trapped within individual pendular rings due to exclusion from entry into surrounding thin films and within film [...] . '' (Wan and Tokunaga, 1997). Thus, while Crist et al. (2004) implied that the film straining model applies only to retardation of colloid transport within thin films, colloid retention within perimeters of pendular rings is a main feature of our model...|$|R

The solution for a perfectly wetting fluid (which can never have pinned <b>contact</b> <b>lines)</b> is obtained, and it is shown that, despite having the same local behaviour, the global behaviour of a rivulet of a non-perfectly wetting fluid is qualitatively {{different from that of}} a slowly varying rivulet with prescribed constant contact angle but slowly varying semi-width.

In particular, it is shown that whereas neither the shape of the rivulet nor the velocity within it vary monotonically with N, its mass always decreases monotonically with N.
