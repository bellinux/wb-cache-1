50|$|A <b>covered</b> goods <b>wagon</b> or van is {{a railway}} goods wagon which is {{designed}} for the transportation of moisture-susceptible goods and therefore fully enclosed by sides and a fixed roof. They are often referred to simply as <b>covered</b> <b>wagons,</b> {{and this is the}} term used by the International Union of Railways (UIC). Since the introduction of the international classification for goods wagons by the UIC in the 1960s a distinction has been drawn between ordinary and special <b>covered</b> <b>wagons.</b> Other types of wagon, such as refrigerated vans and goods wagons with opening roofs, are closely related to <b>covered</b> <b>wagons</b> from a design point of view.|$|R
5|$|Construction {{of the set}} {{began on}} December 5, 1994, on Paramount Stage 16. The set's {{construction}} pushed the episode's cost over its budget. This was considered normal for a new series and the next four episodes also exceeded their budgets. Despite {{the high cost of}} the manor set, the crew designed it for repeated use {{over the course of the}} series. This was more appealing than shooting several sequences of a <b>covered</b> <b>wagon</b> on location in the countryside. Curry took special care to merge the blue-screen effects with Kolbe's footage seamlessly to achieve the effect of the manor transforming back into the holodeck. Curry and Kolbe had worked together on previous projects that required similar special effects.|$|E
5|$|Smith was {{instrumental}} in the inauguration of the air mail service by the United States Postal Service (USPS) in the summer of 1919.

His mother had taken this trail by <b>covered</b> <b>wagon</b> from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Cove, Oregon, in 1871. His mother and grandparents had taken two years to complete their trip, whereas Smith flew his route to California within a week with several stops along the way.|$|E
5|$|The Absaroka and Beartooth Mountains {{are partly}} in the {{northern}} section of the forest. The Wind River Range is in the southern portion and contains Gannett Peak, the tallest mountain in Wyoming. Yellowstone National Park forms part of the boundary to the west; south of Yellowstone, the Continental Divide separates the forest from its neighbor Bridger-Teton National Forest to the west. The eastern boundary includes privately owned property, lands managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Wind River Indian Reservation, which belongs to the Shoshone and Arapahoe Indians. Custer National Forest along the Montana border is on the northern frontier. The Oregon Trail, the 19th century <b>covered</b> <b>wagon</b> route, passes {{just south of the}} forest, where broad and gentle South Pass allowed the migrants to bypass the rugged mountains to the north.|$|E
