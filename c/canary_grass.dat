Foods taken in preference to others include pine nuts, sweetgum seeds, and the seeds of pokeberry, amaranth, <b>canary</b> <b>grass,</b> corn, sesame, and wheat.

5|$|The {{invasion}} of non-native plants into its habitat {{is a large}} threat to the bog turtles' survival. Although several plants disrupt its ecosystem, the three primary culprits are purple loosestrife, reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass,</b> and reeds, which grow thick and tall and are believed to hinder {{the movement of the}} turtles. Such plants also out-compete the native species in the bog turtle's habitat, thus reducing the amount of food and protection available to the turtles.|$|E

40|$|For {{the project}} needs were {{established}} heating pellets from {{different combinations of}} vegetation materials. During solution was displayed that the most significant energy crop is energy sorrel with still more gradual importance in agricultural practice. For this reason we have concentrated particularly to that crop as basic material available in sufficient amount. The pressing mixtures were selected in suck way to contain at least 50 % of energy sorrel. Second important crop is <b>canary</b> reed <b>grass</b> used also as significant component. For the made pellets were tested mechanical properties, energy and chemical properties, ash properties and emissions from their combustion. It was proved that pellets mode from mixtures of energy sorrel with other bio-materials have considerably better using properties than those from pure sorrel or pure feedstock of other energy crops. A {{part of the project}} was investigation of lignin content in pellets and correlation of this value with other physical properties. Further was conducted thermo-vision measuring of burden with various types of heating pellets and evaluation of heating temperatures according to material used for pellets.

40|$|Summary This work {{is aimed}} at parrot {{breeding}} of genus Rossella in Europe, in different climatic conditions than the conditions in the Southeast and South Australia where the birds come from. Here, you can find overview of their occurrence in nature, evaluation of biotope, feeding and information on breeding in human custody. Eastern Rosellas (Platycersus eximius) live in pairs and each pair is very protective of their own nesting teritory. Outside of the nesting season, Rosellas are moving around the land in small groups. In nature, these parrots eat grain from grass or weeds, seeds from bushes, trees and of course fruit. The nesting season starts around february and lasts until august. In nature Rosellas nest in hollow trees, branches, tree stumps, columns, on top of fence post and even in rabbit holes. The best option {{when it comes to}} breeding Rosellas, is an outside aviary, which best represents their natural habitat. European winter causes them little to no trouble, the same goes for severe frost, which allows for year-round stay in the outside aviary. Rosellas have the similar eating habits as their parrot brethren, meaning sunflower seeds, millet, panic <b>grass,</b> <b>canary</b> and oat. An important supplement in their daily diet is green feed(ing), fresh fruit and vegetable, branches to nibble on, mineral substances, and fresh drinking water. During the nesting season and while with young, it is necessary to feed the birds an egg mixture, it is an important source of protein. Breeding of Rosellas is fairly effortless, they can easily nest even in small spaces. Ideal size of their bird house would be 25 x 25 x 60 - 70 cm with a fly-in entrance of 7 - 8 cm. It is necessary to hang the bird houses as high as possible in the protected part of aviary. Female lays 5 - 7 white colored eggs, on which she sits 21 - 22 days. Young birds leave the nest in age between 28 - 35 days and then, are are partly fed additional 10 - 14 days by the male. Among the most frequent diseases of this species of pet birds belong those non contagious, e. g. hypovitaminosis, uricosis and, furthermore parasitical ones and pathogens as well as other contagious diseases or feather abnormalities, such as the so called French defeathering. Breeding of Rosellas does not require an experienced breeder. With proper care, Rosellas can live up to 25 - 30 years and remain fertile their whole lives...|$|R
500|$|The creek {{begins in}} the Coast Range {{ecoregion}} designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and flows thereafter through the Willamette Valley ecoregion. The narrow riparian corridors along streams in the watershed commonly include native species such as western redcedar, Douglas fir, vine maple, and sword fern as well as invasive species like English ivy. Many red alder and big leaf maple grow in the watershed, and shrubs include red huckleberry, Oregon-grape, elderberry, wood rose, and salmonberry. A restoration project in Tigard along the main stem has removed invasive plants such as reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> and Himalayan blackberry {{and replaced them with}} native species.

A variety of different recipes are used to make the brew depending on the purpose of the ayahuasca session, or local availability of ingredients. Two common sources of DMT in the western US are reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> (Phalaris arundinacea) and Harding grass (Phalaris aquatica). These invasive grasses contain low levels of DMT and other alkaloids. In addition, Jurema (Mimosa tenuiflora) shows evidence of DMT content: the pink layer in the inner rootbark of this small tree contains a high concentration of N,N-DMT.|$|E

The southern part is capped by basalt and nearly level. In the northern part, the basalt cap is absent, and the terrain is more rolling and dissected. Elevation varies from 2,000to4,000feet (610to1,219m), with buttes as high as [...] The climate has a marine influence, and the region is less arid than the botanically similar High Lava Plains of the Northern Basin and Range ecoregion to the southeast. Because of {{the proximity of the}} High Cascades, stream density and water availability are high. As a result, human population density is much higher than in the High Lava Plains. Canals carry river water to irrigated farms on floodplains and terraces growing grass seed, winter wheat, potatoes, alfalfa, mint, onions, carrots for seed, and garlic. Potential natural vegetation includes Wyoming big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, basin big sagebrush, mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, and needle-and-thread on the sagebrush steppe, with western juniper on shallow, rocky soils.
