50|$|The Interactional View {{requires}} {{a network of}} <b>communication</b> <b>rules</b> that govern a family homeostasis, which is the tacit collusion of family members {{to maintain the status}} quo. Even if the status quo is negative it can still be hard to change. Interactional theorists believe that we will fail to recognize this destructive resistance to change unless we understand Watzlawick's axioms. The following axioms can explain how miscommunication can occur if all the communicators are not on the same page. If one of these axioms is somehow disturbed, communication might fail. All of these axioms are derived from the work of Gregory Bateson, much of which is collected in Steps to an Ecology of Mind (1972).|$|E

5000|$|Developed in 1978 by Burgoon, {{this theory}} {{has its roots}} in Uncertainty Reduction Theory, which {{attempts}} to predict and explain how communication is used to reduce uncertainty among people involved in conversations with one another the last time they meet. Expectancy Violations Theory however proposes that unexpected behavior causes arousal and uncertainty in people, and people then look to explain the violation in order to better predict another's behavior.This theory assumes {{that there is only one}} truth and that the theory seeks to predict the outcomes that will result when violations are presented in certain situations With this theory, Burgoon also builds upon anthropologist Edward T. Hall's previous work on proxemics and personal space. Violating someone's personal space, for example, violates the expectations of the receiving party which will [...] "be perceived as either positively or negatively depending on the liking between the two people." [...] Burgoon suggests that nonverbal behavior is carefully tailored to conform to the <b>communication</b> <b>rules</b> of one's partner, while violating certain social norms and individual expectations may be [...] "a superior strategy to conformity".|$|E

The paper introduces an SOS style axiomatization of the standard labelled transition semantics for graph transformation systems that is based on the idea of minimal reaction contexts as labels, due to Leifer and Milner. In comparison to previous work on inductive definitions of similarly derived LTSs, the main feature of the proposed axiomatization is a composition rule that captures the communication of sub-systems so that it can feature as a counterpart to the <b>communication</b> <b>rule</b> of CCS...|$|R
