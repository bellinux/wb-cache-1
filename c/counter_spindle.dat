The tailstock (10) and/or the steadyrest (11) have a sliding movement at right angles to the rotary axis, independently of the lathes (2, 4). One lathe has a main spindle (2) and the other lathe has a <b>counter</b> <b>spindle</b> (5), on parallel axes (z 1,z 1), and with their {{workpiece holder}}s towards each other. The lathe assembly is controlled manually or automatically. USE - The double-spindle lathe is for machining two workpieces simultaneously. ADVANTAGE - The lathe structure gives shorter machining times to increase the machine productivity...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} hard turning using {{a cutting tool}} with Xcel geometry. This {{is one of the}} new geometries, and there is not any {{information}} about Xcel wear in comparison to the conventional geometry. It is already known from cutting tools producers that using the Xcel geometry leads to higher quality of machined surface, perticularly surface roughness. It is possible to achieve more than 4 times lower Ra and Rz values after turning than after using conventional geometry with radius. The workpiece material was 100 Cr 6 hardened steel with hardness of 60 ± 1 HRC. The machine used for the experiment was a lathe with <b>counter</b> <b>spindle</b> DMG CTX alpha 500, which is located in the Centre of Excellence of 5 –axis Machining at the Faculty of Materials Science and Technology in Trnava. The cutting tools made by CBN were obtained from Sandvik COROMANT Company...|$|E
5000|$|A device, {{called a}} [...] "casekeep" [...] was {{employed}} to assist the players and prevent dealer cheating by counting cards. The casekeep resembled an abacus, with one spindle for each card denomination, with four <b>counters</b> on each <b>spindle.</b> As a card was played, either winning or losing, one of four counters would be moved to indicate that a card of that denomination had been played. This allowed players to plan their bets by keeping track of what cards remained available in the dealing box. The operator of the case keep is called the [...] "casekeeper", or colloquially in the American West, the [...] "coffin driver".|$|R
