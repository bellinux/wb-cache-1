5|$|From 1749 to the 1760s, Fort <b>Chambray</b> {{was built}} on the island of Gozo. It was {{intended}} to be a new fortified city like Valletta, and eventually to replace the Cittadella as the island's capital. This was unsuccessful, and eventually only the fort was built. It saw some action during the French occupation of 1798, but its importance eventually diminished. It was converted into a hospital in the 19th century. In the 1990s, the interior of the fort began to be redeveloped, but the outer bastions and some barracks remain intact.|$|E
25|$|Following its capture, Fort <b>Chambray</b> was {{manned by}} a French garrison. On 3 September, {{a day after}} the Maltese {{uprising}} began in Mdina, the Gozitans revolted against the French, and quickly took over the island except for Fort <b>Chambray</b> and the Cittadella. On 28 October 1798, Gozitan rebels led by Saverio Cassar and British marines led by Captain Cresswell attacked the fort, and it capitulated on the following day. Other, probably more reliable, sources says that Fort <b>Chambray</b> was abandoned by French soldiers during the night of 16 and 17 September.|$|E

40|$|This chapter investigates {{some of the}} axes of {{parallelism}} {{that were}} drawn up during the quarrel of the ancient and moderns: historical, linguistic, technical and aesthetic. Its focus is on a French text that slightly precedes the main period of the querelle, Roland Fréart de <b>Chambray’s</b> Parallèle de l'architecture antique avec la moderne (Paris, 1650) and its English translation by John Evelyn (1664). The Parallèle exemplifies a mode of comparative, critical inquiry that was characteristically modernistic. But its translation and publication in England lifted it into cultural context in many ways at odds with that from which it came, and the consequence was a twisting or refraction of its meanings that tells us much {{about the differences between}} the French and English modes of the ancients-moderns quarrel. A further set of distorting parallels are provided by Vitruvian architecture’s own equivocal position on the fault-line between ancient and modern technology, and between degraded techne and liberal praxis arts. These parallels correspond with similar tensions within the broader experimental and socio-mechanical project instituted in the Royal Society, of which Evelyn was an active member during the 1660 s...|$|R
5000|$|The city of Durham materialized off a {{railroad}} {{because it was}} considered [...] "healthy land," [...] starting its journey towards the tobacco center of the South nearly 100 years later. In a nearby newspaper in 1855, John A. McMannen proposed to develop the area near the train stop by advertising land in the new location. In 1884 and 1887, Julian S. Carr erected the Durham Cotton Manufacturing Company and Golden Belt Manufacturing Company. The cotton manufacturing company made [...] "cloth for tobacco bags to <b>chambrays,</b> gingams … and colored goods." [...] The Golden Belt factory, while less profitable than the cotton factory, expanded rapidly making primarily cloth bags for selling tobacco, Flour Sacks, and the like. As the cotton and silk business took off, the industry leaders decided to expand their manufacturing options and created hosiery mills, essentially - sock companies. In 1898, Carr merged his Golden Belt Hosiery Company with Durham Hosiery Company, owned by George W. Graham, to create the Durham Hosiery Mills, [...] "a firm destined for success." [...] The business grew rapidly and required another plant {{to keep up with}} demands. In 1901, machines were moved to an eastern section of Durham, and the neighborhood of Edgemont grew up around it. To fill the factories, surrounding communities were developed into suitable living spaces, as the newspapers phrased it, [...] "Edgemont will be the beautiful industrial silkworm that will come from the Smoky Hollow cocoon." [...] As Edgemont and other surrounding neighborhoods started to develop, the African American working community already started to move into the region and become a prominent part of the society.|$|R

25|$|Fort <b>Chambray</b> saw {{its first}} {{use during the}} French {{invasion}} of Malta in June 1798. When the French landed on Gozo, many inhabitants took refuge within <b>Chambray,</b> bringing their livestock with them. At the time, the fort was commanded by the knight de Megrigny, and it was armed with 72 pieces of artillery. The fort initially offered some resistance, but it capitulated after the French General Regnier posted three companies {{in front of the}} fort, and issued a proclamation ordering its garrison to surrender. The Gozitans who had taken refuge returned to their homes with their cattle.|$|E
25|$|Until 10 June 1798, Malta and Gozo {{had been}} {{administered}} by the Order of Saint John. When Napoleon ousted the Knights from the islands in the Mediterranean campaign of 1798, the French established garrisons in various locations in Malta, {{as well as the}} Cittadella and Fort <b>Chambray,</b> the main fortifications on Gozo.|$|E
40|$|English {{writers and}} enthusiasts {{on the arts}} that existed prior to the {{eighteenth-century}} have largely come to be identified in modern scholarship as virtuosi, those who {{had little or no}} separate aesthetic appreciation for works of art, but an insatiable curiosity for all manner of natural and mechanical wonders. This thesis examines English literature on painting from the period, and contests the idea that {{it was only in the}} eighteenth century that English authors began to write critically about the pictorial arts. Printed literature in fact reveals a sustained interest in the judgement and value of painting from the mid-seventeenth century onwards, authored by, and addressed to, the more specialised lover of art. The chapters that make up this thesis are subsequently built around close readings of varying forms of literature through six case studies of texts published between 1658 and 1706 : Chapter One examines William Sanderson’s Graphice (1658) which combines material drawn from earlier literature with original observations and ideas. Chapter Two explores John Evelyn’s translation of Roland Fréart de <b>Chambray’s</b> Idée de la Perfection de la Peinture (1662) as An Idea of the Perfection of Painting (1668), and William Aglionby’s Painting Illustrated in Three Dialogues (1685) based on the work of French critic Charles Alphonse Dufresnoy, in relation to both authors’ time spent abroad and their simultaneous celebration of the primacy of Italian painters and history painting. Chapter Three focuses on the most commercially successful literary work on the visual arts of the period, Polygraphice. Authored by the quack empiric William Salmon, the text went through eight editions between 1672 and 1701, each edition growing as its contents were expanded and added to with a diversity of material. Chapter Four compares Richard Graham’s ‘Short Account of the most Eminent Painters both Ancient and Modern, Continu’d down to the Present Times According to the Order of their Succession’ (1695) which presents an inaugural literary national art history presented within a pan-European context, and Bainbrigg Buckeridge’s ‘Essay Towards an English School, With the Lives and Characters of above 100 Painters’ (1706) presenting an alternative account of English taste and practice in painting in the seventeenth century...|$|R

25|$|In January 1992, the Planning Services Division of the Ministry for Development of Infrastructure {{published}} the Fort <b>Chambray</b> Development Brief, {{in which it}} detailed that the fort should be redeveloped, while retaining the outer bastions, the barracks, bakeries, chapels and hospital complex.

25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Anglo-Egyptian War in 1882, a large building which had previously been barracks was converted to a hospital in order to house casualties from the war. It was used as a Convalescent Depot during World War I, and thousands of ill or wounded patients passed through the hospital between October 1915 and its closure in March 1916. During this period, the medical staff issued a journal called The Fort <b>Chambray</b> Gazette.|$|E

The hospital was subsequently used by both the British military and Maltese civilians when there were fever epidemics.|$|E
