The authors caution that [...] "there is a difficulty in untangling cause and effect. We cannot tell whether paedophiles gravitate towards children because, being highly introverted, they find the company of children less threatening than that of adults, or whether the social withdrawal implied by their introversion {{is a result of the}} isolation engendered by their preference i.e., awareness of the social disapprobation and hostility that it evokes" [...] (p. 324).

50|$|Puna grasslands {{are being}} rapidly {{depleted}} by human activity, {{and as a}} result need much attention in the conservation realm. Numerous factors can lead to the cause of this destruction, but the preservation of it depends almost entirely on to what degree humans are populating the area. Humans dramatically shape the ecosystem through the conversion of much of the land to farming grounds and grazing areas. Due to the high demand for cooking and heating fuel among the residents of the area, much of the land is degraded. For example, trees of the polylepis genus used to be easily found throughout the ecosystem and now are scarce. The most widespread influence on the grasslands is extensive grazing combined with the effects of fire. Because grazing dries out the land, it is more susceptible to fire. Once a land has been exposed to fire, it makes it more likely to burn again, creating a feedback loop that leads to damage of the ecosystem. Despite the fact that the puna grasslands experience heavy grazing, as an ecosystem it is highly resilient. In these areas of high grazing, successional species of grass and forbs grow back thick, thereby preserving the soil which means its potential to rebound is higher. The grasslands are also influenced more locally by agriculture, mining, and waste disposal depending on the concentration of the population. There are two predominant forms of management of the puna grazing lands. The first is communal. In this form of management, the <b>community</b> <b>controls</b> the land and every member of that community grazes livestock. This generally leads to overgrazing and degradation of the land. The second style of management is cooperative. This type of management originated from a movement that took land from large landholders and turned it over to council composed of workers. Agronomists and animal scientists see over the land and make sure the grazing is sustainable.Though there are a significant amount of problems in puna grasslands, mostly being attributed to overgrazing, there are measures being taken to improve the current situation. These measures are minimal, the ratio of protected areas {{to the rest of the}} ecosystem is minute. A growing population, construction of new roads, and mining activities are all acting as hindrances to the conservation of the ecosystem. Luckily, awareness is being raised about the problem, and steps are being taken to help improve its preservation. Currently range management programs are being introduced in many of the neighboring universities to research new ideas that implement little technology and can help restore the ecosystem. With the right management, the puna grasslands can rebound and support the growing populations of the surrounding areas. Ultimately however, it is up to the local individuals of the area to coordinate other ways they can receive income in ways that does not harm the land.|$|E
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether hospital controls {{could be used in}} case-control studies with minimal bias, where resource constraints limit recruitment of <b>community</b> <b>controls.</b> Hospital controls and <b>community</b> <b>controls</b> were compared for socio-demographic and risk factor variables in a study of Smokeless Tobacco (SLT) use and Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) in Bangladesh in 2010. Incident cases of CHD and hospital controls were selected from cardiac hospitals. <b>Community</b> <b>controls</b> were selected from neighbourhoods of CHD cases. We enrolled 302 cases, 302 hospital controls, and 1208 <b>community</b> <b>controls.</b> Distribution of age, gender, marital status, occupation, and socio-economic status was similar between hospital controls and <b>community</b> <b>controls.</b> Compared to <b>community</b> <b>controls,</b> hospital controls were more educated, had higher rates of hypertension and reported more family history of heart diseases.

This study aims at evaluating benzodiazepine use in a disaster-stricken community {{with the help of}} computer-based records. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This prospective cohort study covers a period of 4 years. For every patient, predisaster baseline data are available. Multilevel regression is applied to study differences in benzodiazepine use in 496 patients whose children were involved in the Volendam café fire on January 1, 2001 compared with 1, 709 <b>community</b> <b>controls,</b> and 4, 530 patients from an unaffected cohort. RESULTS: In <b>community</b> <b>controls</b> and patients from the unaffected cohort, benzodiazepine use remained stable {{in the course of the}} years. In the first year postfire, parents of disaster victims were 1. 58 times more likely to use benzodiazepines than <b>community</b> <b>controls</b> (95 % confidence interval 1. 13 - 2. 23). With regard to long-term use, differences between <b>community</b> <b>controls</b> and parents were statistically nonsignificant.

Results: Firesetters were significantly more likely to have been registered with psychiatric services (37 %) compared with other offenders (29. 3 %) and <b>community</b> <b>controls</b> (8. 7 %). The firesetters were also more likely to have utilised a diverse range of public mental health services. Firesetters attracted psychiatric diagnoses more often than <b>community</b> <b>controls</b> and other offenders, particularly affective, substance use, and personality disorders. Conclusions: This study confirms that there is a link between firesetting and psychopathology, suggesting that there is a role for the psychiatric screening of known firesetters, and a need to consider psychopathology in formulating the risk for further firesetting...|$|E
40|$|Background: Tuberculosis (TB) {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the major causes of illnesses and deaths worldwide. Currently, it is estimated that about one-third of the world population is infected with TB. Early effective diagnosis and treatment are crucial to reduce mortality, morbidity and transmission of TB. Tuberculin skin test (TST) has been widely used as a screening test for TB and has contributed substantially for generating valuable epidemiological information on infection trends and on the magnitude of disease. Tuberculosis low incidence countries of Western Europe and USA use TST for screening TB among migrant population from high endemic countries of Africa and Asia. For example, it is a normal procedure for students from TB endemic countries coming to Norway to undergo TST, and skin induration of ≥ 10 mm is considered positive for infection. However, it is not well established that skin induration of ≥ 10 mm is an indication of clinical disease, infection, or exposure to environmental mycobacteria in TB high endemic countries such as Ethiopia. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the size of TST indurations in individuals with active TB, their household contacts and <b>community</b> <b>controls</b> and to optimize the cut-off point for the diagnosis/ suspecting of active TB in endemic setting, Ethiopia. Methods: In a health facility-based cross-sectional study, smear positive pulmonary TB (PTB) patients were recruited consecutively from selected health institutions, whereas their household contacts were traced back using the index cases. <b>Community</b> <b>controls</b> were also selected randomly from households neighboring index cases. Sputum was collected from all patients for AFB staining and culture. Provider initiated HIV testing and counseling was done for all participants and participants who were negative for HIV infection were included. Participants were also tested by TST and QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In Tube test (QFT-GIT). In addition, chest X-ray was done for household contacts and <b>community</b> <b>controls</b> with TST results ≥ 10 mm. Results: a total of 224 study participants, 50 smear positive PTB patients, 96 household contacts and 78 <b>community</b> <b>controls</b> were included in this study. All smear positive PTB patients who had skin test results (n= 48) had skin test induration ≥ 10 mm, while 44 (91. 7 %) had skin test induration ≥ 15 mm. Among 88 household contacts who had skin test results, 64 (72. 2 %) had skin test induration ≥ 10 mm, while 58 (65. 9 %) had skin induration ≥ 15 mm. Among 75 <b>community</b> <b>controls</b> who had skin test results, 35 (46. 7 %) had skin test induration ≥ 10 mm, while 26 (34. 7 %) had skin test induration ≥ 15 mm. The mean size of TST induration was significantly higher in TB patients (18. 1 mm) compared to that of household contacts (13. 6 mm) and <b>community</b> <b>controls</b> (7. 9 mm) (p< 0. 001) [...] The mean size of skin test induration was higher in individuals who had BCG scar compared to individuals without BCG scar in household contacts and <b>community</b> <b>controls</b> (p< 0, 05). Among 44 TB patients who had QFTGIT results, 36 (81. 8 %) had ≥ 0. 35 IU/ml of IFN- level. Out of 91 household contacts and 58 <b>community</b> <b>controls</b> who were tested by QFTGIT, 64 (70, 3 %) and 32 (55. 2 %) had ≥ 0. 35 IU/ml of IFN level, respectively. The mean level of IFN- was 4. 68 IU/ml in TB patients, 4. 90 IU/ml in contacts and 2. 62 IU/ml in <b>community</b> <b>controls.</b> The difference in the mean level of IFN- in TB patients and <b>community</b> <b>controls</b> as well as in household contacts and <b>community</b> <b>controls</b> were also significant (p< 0. 05). The mean level of IFN- did not differ by BCG status or by socio-demographic characteristics of the study participants.. Using sputum culture as a reference test skin test induration ≥ 10 mm was found to be 100 % sensitive in identifying TB patients, while the sensitivity was 91. 7 % at skin test induration ≥ 15 mm. Considering QFT-GIT as reference test in contacts, at skin test indurations ≥ 8 mm, 10 mm, 11 mm and 15 mm, the sensitivities were found to be 95 %, 91. 7 %, 83. 3 % and 81. 7 %, respectively, while the specificity was 68 % in all cases. In <b>community</b> <b>controls,</b> at skin test indurations ≥ 10 mm and 15 mm, the sensitivities were found to be 81. 3 % and 65. 6 %, respectively, while the respective specificities were 80. 8 %, 88. 5 % and 100 %. Among 40 household contacts who had chest X-ray results, 2 (5 %) were found to be active TB cases. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare TST skin induration in culture confirmed pulmonary TB patients, household contacts, and <b>community</b> <b>controls</b> in Ethiopia. The majority (91. 7 %) of smear positive TB patients had skin test induration ≥ 15 mm. Moreover, the specificity of the TST was found to be 100 % at skin test induration ≥ 15 mm in <b>community</b> <b>controls</b> who had no known exposure to TB. Since, a test with high specificity is more useful in areas with a high prevalence of disease, skin test induration ≥ 15 mm seems to be optimal for suspecting active TB and recommending chest X-ray in individuals without symptoms suggestive of active TB, while skin test induration ≥ 10 mm seems optimal to suggest Mtb infection in household contacts of TB patients...|$|E

Several propositions are advanced: First it is argued that the relevance of suburban <b>community</b> <b>control</b> to the poor in the cities is not diminished by the finding that those of high social status participate in politics more than the poor.

Moving from these assertions, it is argued that several models of citizen influence over educational governance can be discerned from the literature on suburban educational politics.

The third assertion is that each of these models has pay-off potential for the urban poor, although each brings certain drawbacks as well. It is argued that what is needed is that we develop <b>community</b> <b>control</b> models which incorporate the important features of each of the current models. The structural similarities between urban and suburban models of <b>community</b> <b>control</b> provide a useful starting point for defining an appropriate model for the cities. (Author/JM...|$|R
