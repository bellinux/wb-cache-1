50|$|However, {{the epitome}} of fowling was the punt gunner. He had what {{amounted}} to a long, small-bore muzzle-loaded cannon. It was mounted along the <b>centre-line</b> <b>of</b> the forward half of a specially designed boat which slightly resembled a heavy wooden kayak in form. The fowler lay in the after half with paddle blades strapped to his forearms. The skill was to stalk a raft of duck until within the rather short range required and to fire the gun from which small shot scattered. It remained to gather up the harvest and get it to market. In the winter, the punt gun might be mounted on a sled and the procedure repeated on the same principles.|$|R

The aim of this project was to give some insight into the flow regime by measuring and analysing velocity profiles on the <b>centre-line</b> <b>of</b> the jump. It was discovered that the velocity profiles followed the accepted theories of turbulent boundary layer flow with respect to the law of the wall and Coles' law of the wake.

50|$|In {{this type}} the ferrite absorbs {{energy from the}} {{microwave}} signal travelling in one direction. A suitable rotating magnetic field {{is found in the}} TE10 mode of rectangular waveguide. The rotating field exists away from the <b>centre-line</b> <b>of</b> the broad wall, over the full height of the guide. However, to allow heat from the absorbed power to be conducted away, the ferrite does not usually extend from one broad-wall to the other, but is limited to a shallow strip on each face. For a given bias field, resonance absorption occurs over a fairly narrow frequency band, but since in practice the bias field is not perfectly uniform throughout the ferrite, the isolator functions over a somewhat wider band.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyses}} {{the minimum}} and central film thickness evolution of elastohydrodynamically lubricated contacts, from circular to wide elliptical contacts.

In this paper, a formula is presented to predict the central film thickness in elliptical contacts using prediction formulas for the line and circular contacts as limiting cases, and the results of numerical calculations to fit the film thickness variation with ellipticity. The formula gives an accurate prediction of the central film thickness over the entire ellipticity regime...|$|R

He {{learned to use}} the Blind approach beacon system (BABS) which Burbridge surmised as audible dots and dashes.

The strength of these images depended on the accuracy and position of the aircraft as it approached <b>centre-line</b> <b>of</b> the runway. The instructor's view was uninhibited, but the student pilot had his windshield covered to simulate an obstruction. In October 1941, after six months of intensive night flight training, Burbridge was declared ready for front-line operations. Burbridge was posted to No. 85 Squadron RAF at RAF Hunsdon in October 1941. It was a satellite airfield for RAF North Weald in Essex. The squadron's commander was Peter Townsend, an experienced combat leader. 85 Squadron was already a battle-hardened formation and had been in action during World War I and the Battle of Britain in 1940.|$|R
50|$|Due to the company's success, and the {{increasing}} number of seaplanes being produced, larger premises with ready access to the sea were needed. At that time, seaplanes were taken by road to Queenborough, then loaded onto lighters to be taken to the RNAS seaplane station on Isle of Grain to be launched and tested.In 1913, an 8.4 acre (3.4 hectare) plot of land by the river Medway about 20 miles (32 km) away at Borstal, near Rochester, Kent, was purchased from Charles Willis (a local councillor), and the planning and construction work started. By early 1915, the first facility of what was to become known as the Seaplane Works was completed: No.1 Erecting Shop. As this and the No.2 and No.3 shops became available, the workforce moved from the Eastchurch factory. No.3 shop was completed in 1917. A long concrete slipway was constructed from the <b>centre-line</b> <b>of</b> No.3 Erecting Shop to enable aircraft of up to 20 tons weight to be launched even at low tide.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{interaction}} of the laser-induced plasma produced by a pulse laser energy depo-sition with the shock wave over a blunt body in a freestream Mach number of 3 is studied numerically and experimentally. The unsteady flow phenomena during the interaction are anal-ysed by the comparison of the flow structures between experiment and calculation to understand {{the effect of the}} energy deposition on the reduction of the pressure {{on the wall of the}} blunt body. The stagnation point pressure on the <b>centre-line</b> <b>of</b> the blunt body is compared between exper-iment and calculation to confirm the qualitative feature of the unsteady flowfields so analysed. The present result shows that the unsteady flow phenomena are consistent with the time vari-ation of the stagnation point pressure, and that the time variation of the pressure is in a good agreement between experiment and calculation. The drag averaged over an interaction time is evaluated based on the calculated data...|$|R
40|$|The {{slumping}} of a {{thin sheet}} of very viscous liquid glass {{is used in}} the manufacture of windscreens in the automotive industry. The governing equations for an asymptotically thin sheet with variable viscosity are derived in which the vertical coordinate forms the <b>centre-line</b> <b>of</b> the sheet. The time-dependant equations have been solved numerically using the backward Euler method to give results in both two and three dimensions. The flow of an initially flat sheet falls freely under gravity until it becomes curved and the flow becomes very slow in the slumped phase. Finally the sheet freefalls as the thickness becomes small at the boundaries. The inverse problem in which the viscosity profile is to be determined for a given shape can be solved as an embedding problem in which a search is made amongst the forward solutions. Possible shapes in the two-dimensional problem are very restrictive and are shown {{to be related to the}} sheet thickness. In three dimensions the range of shapes is much greater...|$|R
40|$|This note {{covers the}} {{development}} of two strain-gauge balances for use on the Whirling Arm Facility of the College. The main requirements for this balance were:- (a) to withstand 700 lbs of sideload without it interfering with the lift, drag and pitching moment measurements, (b) {{to have a high}} sensitivity without too heavy a structure. The balance originally designed for this purpose proved to be unacceptable because of undue interference due to sideload and the non-repetitive nature of its calibration curves. With the information gained from this first balance a second balance of exceedingly simpler design, was manufactured and was found to give good calibration curves and sensitivity, with little interference from sideloads. A trouble free method of recording the signals from the strain-gauge bridges is being developed and should be operating within the near future. It concluded that a new model, with its c. g. lying on the transverse <b>centre-line</b> <b>of</b> the balance, will be needed if sideload interference is to be further reduced...|$|R
