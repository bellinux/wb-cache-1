2500|$|Nanoconcrete {{is created}} by high-energy mixing (HEM) of <b>cement,</b> <b>sand</b> and water. To ensure the mixing is {{thorough}} enough to create nano-concrete, the mixer must apply a total mixing power to the mixture of 30 - 600 watts per kilogram of the mix. [...] This mixing must continue long enough to yield a net specific energy expended upon the mix of at least 5000 joules per kilogram of the mix. A plasticizer or a superplasticizer is then added to the activated mixture which can later be mixed with aggregates in a conventional concrete mixer. In the HEM process, the intense mixing of cement and water with sand provides dissipation of energy and increases shear stresses {{on the surface of}} cement particles. This intense mixing serves to divide the cement particles into extremely fine nanometer scale sizes, which provides for extremely thorough mixing. [...] This results in the increased volume of water interacting with cement and acceleration of Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) colloid creation.|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> is examined experimentally and theoretically in this study. The first {{segment of the}} investigation involves an extensive laboratory program {{to examine the effects}} of slenderness ratio, effects of cementation, and effects of confining pressure on the stress-strain curves of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands.</b> Results show that specimens with slenderness ratio of 1. 5 or greater exhibit lower strength, higher dilatation rates, and relatively brittle behavior when compared to samples with slenderness ratio of 1. Furthermore, <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> have an essentially straight line Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope, whose cohesion intercept increases with the degree of cementation of the soil. The effective friction angles measured for <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> with various cementation levels are in the same ranges as the effective friction angle evaluated for uncemented sands. Moreover, failure modes of the material varies from brittle to ductile depending upon the level of cementation and the degree of confinement. In general, as cementation increases, <b>cemented</b> <b>sand</b> exhibits a brittle failure behavior; while increasing the confining pressure causes a ductile failure response. The second portion of the project includes development of a constitutive model for <b>cemented</b> <b>sands.</b> <b>Cemented</b> <b>sand</b> is viewed as a multi-phase material comprising three phases: <b>sand,</b> <b>cement,</b> and pore water. The elastoplastic {{behavior of}} <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> is the consequence of the behavior of the individual phases plus the interaction of the phases. The individual phases (<b>sand</b> and <b>cement)</b> are modeled using the theory of plasticity. Mixtures theory is used to assemble the individual phases to simulate the overall behavior of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands.</b> The gradual damage of the internal structure of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> is also incorporated within the model. The agreement between experimental data and model predictions is very good.

The primary objective {{of this study is}} to perform cavity expansion analysis in lightly <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> by implementing an appropriate constitutive model into a program CONPOINT. Comparing with uncemented <b>sands,</b> <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> have higher strength and stiffness, lower strains to yield and higher dilatancy. The stress-dilatancy relationship of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> is not the one-to-one type. Because of the differences in mechanical behavior between <b>cemented</b> and uncemented <b>sands,</b> a framework for describing the behavior of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> was established first, under which an extended Mohr-Coulomb model for <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> was proposed. Based on Rowe 2 ̆ 7 s relation, a stress-dilatancy relation for <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> was derived and then adopted as a flow rule in the proposed model. Both friction angle and cohesion in the model vary according to soil state and strain history. Upon satisfactorily simulating the triaxial test data on two artificially <b>cemented</b> <b>sands,</b> the proposed model was implemented into the CONPOINT program. Through numerical analysis, it has been found that, at low confining pressures, cementation greatly changes the stress and strain distributions in the plastic zone around the cavity; while at high confining pressures, the changes in stress and strain are not obvious as those at low confining pressure. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted on the static liquefaction behaviour of very loose lightly <b>cemented</b> <b>sands.</b> Undrained and drained triaxial compression tests, one dimensional consolidation, high stress compression, and unconfined compression tests were performed on artificially prepared lightly cemented loose samples with cement-sand ratios of 2, 4 and 6 %. Additional tests were also conducted on uncemented samples prepared at the same initial void ratio as the cemented samples. Besides the influence of degree of cementation, the effects of void ratio and confining pressure on the liquefaction potential of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> were examined. The aim {{of this study is to}} make significant contribution to the understanding of static liquefaction failures in lightly <b>cemented</b> <b>sands.</b> It is shown that cementation could increase the initial stiffness and yield strength of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> but its effect might decrease considerably after the peak strength because of destruction of the cementation bond. The response of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> at lower <b>cement</b> contents was very similar to the response of loose sands and behaviour approached the response of medium to dense sands with increase in the degree of cementation. It is also shown that degree of cementation has a significant influence on liquefaction resistance. Even though the presence of small amounts of cementation did not prevent liquefaction failure, the liquefaction resistance of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> generally increased for higher degrees of cementation. The consolidation, high stress compression and unconfined compression tests demonstrated the effect of cementation in increasing both the stiffness and strength of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands.</b> The unconfined compression strength increased approximately linearly with the increase in cement content. The rate of strength gain increased with an increase in the dry density of the compacted sample, indicating that the cementation was more for denser samples...|$|R
40|$|Bond {{breakages}} provide all-important {{information for}} construction of a mechanistic picture of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} is to characterize the bond breakages in <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> utilizing acoustic emission technique. In the first part of this study, bond breakages in <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> subject to isotropic loading, unloading, and triaxial shearing are characterized by the measurement of acoustic emission (AE) using piezoelectric AE transducers. In all these different loading stages, the AE that is initiated by bond breakages can be detected. The AE rate demonstrates a great resemblance to the associated stress-strain response. In addition, the secant Young’s moduli decrease with an increase in the corresponding cumulative AE and the decreasing trend reflects the different stress-strain responses. These observations suggest an intimate relationship between the bond breakages and the mechanical response in <b>cemented</b> <b>sands.</b> Bond breakages and the associated AE rates are mild in the beginning of shearing and then increase to initiate yielding and ultimately a local weakness, i. e., the formation of shear banding. After shear banding becomes mature, the bond breakage and the resulted AE rate render a distinct drop. If the shearing rate is slower, the test sample becomes stiffer and the measured AE is less when compared with a case subject to a higher shearing rate. Bond breakages are captured during the sampling process of <b>cemented</b> <b>sands,</b> i. e., under an unloading-reloading cycle, and the major portion of the bond-breakage events occur during reloading. These bond breakages eventually weaken the sample and lead to lower stiffness. In the second part of this study, a MEMS accelerometer, MEMSA (1 kHz – 3 kHz), and a commercially available piezoelectric AE transducer, PZT (125 kHz – 750 kHz), are used to capture the AE responses in uncemented and <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> during triaxial compression tests, with particular emphasis on the former one. The AE rates measured in the <b>cemented</b> <b>sands</b> by both sensors demonstrate a similar trend and show a great resemblance to the stress-strain response.
