60|$|In {{spite of}} the {{unpleasant}} reflections that crowded upon my mind, I could not but be entertained by the novel and animated sight which now met my view. One after another, the natives crowded along the narrow path, laden with every variety of fruit. Here, you might have seen one, who, after ineffectually endeavouring to persuade a surly porker to be conducted in leading-strings, was obliged at last to seize the perverse animal in his arms, and carry him struggling again his naked breast, and squealing without intermission. There went two, who at a little distance might have been taken for the Hebrew spies, on their return to Moses with the goodly bunch of grapes. One trotted before the other {{at a distance of}} a couple of yards, while between them, from a pole resting on their shoulders, was suspended a huge <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> <b>bananas,</b> which swayed to and fro with the rocking gait at which they proceeded. Here ran another, perspiring with his exertions, and bearing before him a quantity of cocoa-nuts, who, fearful of being too late, heeded not the fruit that dropped from his basket, and appeared solely intent upon reaching his destination, careless how many of his cocoa-nuts kept company with him.|$|E

40|$|The Banana Bunchy Top Virus (Genus: Babuvirus) reduces {{plant growth}} and {{prevents}} <b>banana</b> production. Because <b>of</b> {{the very large}} number <b>of</b> properties with <b>banana</b> plants in South East Queensland, Australia, a mapping approach was developed to delineate individual and <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> plants to help plant identification and enable prioritization of plant inspections for Banana Bunchy Top Virus. Due to current outbreaks in South East Queensland, there are concerns that the virus may spread to the major banana growing districts further north. The mapping approach developed was based on very high spatial resolution airborne orthophotos. Object-based image analysis was used to: (1) detect banana plants using edge and line detection approaches; (2) produce accurate and realistic outlines around classified banana plants; and (3) evaluate the mapping results. The mapping approach was developed based on 10 image tiles of 1 km × 1 km and was applied to orthophotos (3600 image tiles) from September 2011 covering the entire Sunshine Coast Region in South East Queensland. Based on field inspections of the classified maps, a user’s mapping accuracy of 88 % (n = 146) was achieved. The results will facilitate the detection <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> plants and increase the inspection rate <b>of</b> <b>Banana</b> Bunchy Top Virus in the future...|$|R

5000|$|There are {{dangerous}} spider species which {{are related to}} tarantulas and frequently confused with them. A popular urban legend maintains that deadly varieties of tarantula exist somewhere in South America. This claim is often made without identifying a particular spider, although the [...] "banana tarantula" [...] is sometimes named. A likely candidate for the true identity of this spider is the dangerous Brazilian wandering spider Phoneutria nigriventer, of the family Ctenidae, as it is sometimes found hiding in <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>bananas</b> {{and is one of}} several spiders called the [...] "banana spider." [...] It is not technically a tarantula but it is fairly large (4-5 inch legspan), somewhat hairy, and is highly venomous to humans. Another dangerous type of spider that has been confused with tarantulas is the Australasian funnel-web spider. The best known of these is the Sydney funnel-web spider Atrax robustus, a spider that is aggressive, highly venomous, and (prior to the development of antivenom in the 1980s) was responsible for numerous deaths in Australia. These spiders are members of the same suborder as tarantulas. Some Australians use the slang term 'triantelope' (a corruption of the incorrect term 'tarantula', which is also used) for large, hairy and harmless members of the Huntsman spider family which are often found on interior household walls and in automobiles.|$|R
40|$|Although he {{was afraid}} to take off from work and risk losing his job at the banana plantation, Adrian Mora decided he was much too weak to {{continue}} his ten hour shift. He had already spent most of the morning applying pesticides and covering <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>bananas</b> on the trees with plastic bags in order to protect them from wind, birds, and insects. He informed his boss, Don Jose, he must go home and rest, but he would work extra hours later in the week to make up the lost time. He walked through the farm, set against the edge of remnant fragments of lowland tropical rainforest. This part of southwestern Costa Rica used to be continuous forests and mangrove swamps, but as the land was developed for fruit plantations, cattle ranches, and other types of agriculture, the forests were cleared. Small wooden houses set on low stilts now lined cleared strips of land between the bananas and the forest edge. Palm trees were left standing to provide some scant shade and so that the workers could make use of the palm fronds for roof thatch. Tangled scrubby, secondary growth vegetation stretched out to the houses from the forest edge, years after the clear-cutting. Many workers lived here to be near the plantation rather than commute from the town of Quepos 65 km away. Map based on public domain material from CIA World Factbook.

40|$|A plant {{regeneration}} method with cell suspension cultures <b>of</b> <b>banana,</b> {{and the effect}} of biobalistic on regeneration potential are described in this report. Somatic embryos <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> were obtained from indirect embryogenesis of male inflorescence <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> cultivar Maçã (AAB group).

After four months of culture, somatic embryos started to regenerate. The maximum number of regenerated plants was observed between 45 and 60 days after embryo formation. In the first experiment, 401 plants were regenerated from approximately 10 mL of packed cells. In the second experiment, 399 plants were regenerated from a cell suspension six months older than that of the first experiment.

This experiment used changes in physical and chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> to predict it's ripening rate. Moisture content <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> was determined by using desiccation method and ripening stage <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> was determined by peel colour. Glucose (HK) Assay Kit was used to analyze glucose content <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> and protein content <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> was analyzed by using Bradford reagent.

The results of applying oxygen absorber in banana packaging were unexpected, lowering oxygen level alone in banana packaging promote ripening instead of delaying. Applying moisture absorber in banana packaging supported my hypothesis that reducing relative humidity of packaging environment can speed up ripening process. However, moisture absorber is not able to absorb excess water droplet cause by sweeting of fruit. The results showed that moisture absorber and oxygen absorber were not suitable to be used in either promoting or delaying ripening process <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> because active packaging cannot solve sweating problem leading to deterioration <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> fruits. ...|$|R
40|$|Crown rot <b>of</b> <b>bananas,</b> {{caused by}} a fungal {{parasitic}} complex, {{is one of the}} main quality defects <b>of</b> exported <b>bananas.</b> Major variations in the susceptibility <b>of</b> <b>bananas</b> to crown rot have been observed in different production zones.

30|$|The {{proposed}} technique bears {{at least}} three advantages. First, it leverages a training process to extract automatically multi-scale image features combining both the global and local features <b>of</b> the <b>banana</b> image. The mapping learned from these fine-grained features offers a function to automatically specify the ripening stages <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> given a new input image <b>of</b> a <b>banana.</b> Experimental results from {{a large number of}} 17, 312 images <b>of</b> <b>bananas</b> show that the proposed CNN architecture produces an impressive classification accuracy of 94.4 % at the laboratory level. Second, as the samples <b>of</b> <b>bananas</b> with imperfections are also included in the experiments, the experimental results also validate that our method can be applied to fine-grained classification <b>of</b> <b>bananas</b> at different ripening stages no matter the banana peel bears defects or not. Third, different from some existing methods [32], our indicator does not combine any information from the physiochemical or biological changes during the ripening process <b>of</b> <b>banana.</b> However, it is still able to achieve competitive classification accuracy as validated by our experiments.|$|R
