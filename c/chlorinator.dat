50|$|The <b>chlorinator</b> cell {{consists}} of parallel titanium plates coated with ruthenium and sometimes iridium. Older models {{make use of}} perforated (or mesh) plates rather than solid plates. Electrolysis naturally attracts calcium and other minerals to the plates. Thus, depending on water chemistry and magnitude of use, the cell will require periodic cleaning in a mild acid solution (1 part HCl to 15 parts pool water) which will remove the buildup of calcium. Excessive buildup can reduce {{the effectiveness of the}} cell. Running the <b>chlorinator</b> for long periods with not enough salt in the pool can strip the coating off the cell which then requires an expensive replacement, as can using too strong an acid wash.|$|E
50|$|Water {{sanitation}} instruction included: {{a general}} discussion of sources of supply, types of equipment, sterilization methods, water discipline, etc. Training aids consisted of: lister bag, knapsack filter, testing sets, automatic <b>chlorinator,</b> pumps, pumping and hypo-chlorinator, purification set No. 1 filter, mobile purification unit, distillation unit, charts, water cans and water trailer.|$|E

40|$|Chlorine {{is used in}} {{swimming}} and spa pools to control algae, kill bacteria and to oxidise organic matters. In this project, photovoltaic (PV) power was applied to an electrolysis cell to produce liquid chlorine using brine of sodium chloride. Tests were done to investigate the effect of voltage, current, salt level, water flow rate, and duration of chlorination. Seven systems were installed in selected public and private swimming pools. Results indicated that the variation in solar radiation matches well the need for chlorine production during the day. Proper sizing of the PV array and the electrolytic cell would provide excellent matching performance between solar radiation and chlorine load {{with little or no}} backup required. Using PV for salt-water chlorination is an effective way to semi-automate the input of chlorine into the swimming pool.

40|$|This report {{analyzes}} {{the problem of}} disinfection in an urban context and recommends actions to improve the living conditions of the population. The problems and failures of disinfection begin at the catchment {{with the quality of}} the source, which often needs prechlorination to reduce faecal contamination; postchlorination eliminates the bacteria remaining after treatment. Poor handling of <b>chlorinators,</b> maintenance and the personnel involved are additional factors that lead to failures. The problems and failures in water distribution are related to the handling of valves, prolonged storage, and pipes with slime, bulges and biofilm, which house bacteria and free-living organisms that can carry pathogens. Recommendations include: standardization of chlorination processes, continuous postchlorination, continuity in water distribution insofar as this is possible, pipe maintenance and the replacement of pipes found to be in poor condition. 1.

40|$|As part of {{its program}} to help {{decrease}} the dependency of the United States on foreign imports of nonfuel minerals and to devise technology for the efficient and economic use of domestic resources, the Bureau of Mines smelted and sulfation-leached an ilmenite from northern Minnesota.

The concentrate was smelted with woodchips, coke, and soda ash in 91 -kg-and 1 -metric ton (mt) -capacity electric arc furnaces to form Ti-rich slag and commercial-grade pig iron. The slag contained from 67 to 77 wt pct titanium oxides and from 1. 8 to 7. 2 wt pct iron. Sulfation occurred in a 4. 5 -kg/h moving-bed reactor using S 02 -air mixtures at temperatures of 8000 to 8500 C to form soluble salts of the Ca, Mg, Mn,and Na impurities, which cause plugging of fluidized-bed <b>chlorinators.</b> Subsequently, the sulfated slag was leached in acid to remove the soluble sulfates.

40|$|The Alice Water Treatment Plant (AWTP) {{has several}} {{operating}} problems, which often result in poor turbidity removal and inadequate disinfection residual. Some {{progress has been}} made in upgrading the skills of plant operators, but the plant performance has failed to improve because of faulty equipment, a shortage of maintenance staff and treatment chemicals that are not delivered in time. The coagulant-dosing pump was found to be malfunctioning for an extended period of time resulting in overdose problems. The self-backwashing filters were no longer backwashing as per design and were producing poor quality filtrate. This in turn increased the chlorine demand and combined with frequent failure of the <b>chlorinators,</b> the plant was producing poor microbiological quality final water. The storage system in the bulk distribution system was investigated and it was found that adequate chlorine residual could be achieved, provided the plant problems were rectified. The difficulties experienced in training and retaining adequately skilled people to run water treatment plants in impoverished rural municipalities have been among the major hurdles to providing acceptable water services in these areas. However a partnership between the Universities and the AWTP came up as a possible solution to these problems. It is therefore recommended that rural municipalities consider this approach and strengthen this relationship, as it played a large role in plant improvemen...|$|R
50|$|The {{materials}} for treatment—crushed and roasted ore, or tailings, {{as the case}} may be—are put into the hopper above the revolving barrel, or <b>chlorinator.</b> This latter is made of iron, lined with wood and lead, and sufficiently strong to bear a pressure of 100 lb. to the square inch, its capacity being about 30 cwt. of ore. The charge falls from the hopper into the <b>chlorinator.</b> Water and chlorine-producing chemicals are added—generally sulphuric acid and chloride of lime—the manhole cover is replaced and screwed down so as to be gas tight. On {{the opposite side of the}} barrel there is a valve connected with an air pump, through which air to about the pressure of four atmospheres is pumped in, to liquefy the chlorine gas that is generated, after which the valve is screwed down. The barrel is then set revolving at about ten revolutions a minute, the power being transmitted by a friction wheel. According to the nature of the ore, or the size of the grains of gold, this movement is continued from one to four hours, during which time the gold, from combination with the chlorine gas, has formed a soluble gold chloride, which has all been taken up by the water in the barrel. The <b>chlorinator</b> is then stopped, and the gas and compressed air allowed to escape from the valve through a rubber hose into a vat of lime water. This is to prevent the inhalation of any chlorine gas by the workmen. The manhole cover is now removed and the barrel again set revolving, by which means the contents are thrown automatically into the filter below. This filter is an iron vat lined with lead. It has a false bottom, to which is connected a pipe from a vacuum pump working intermittently. As soon as all the ore has fallen from the <b>chlorinator</b> into the filter, the pump is set going, a partial vacuum is produced in the chamber below the false bottom in the filter, and very rapid filtration results. By this means all the gold chlorides contained in the wet ore may be washed out, a continual stream being passed through it while filtration is going on. The solution running from the filter is continually tested, and when found free from gold, the stream of water is stopped, as is also the vacuum pump. The filter is then tipped up into a truck below, and the tailings run out to the waste heap. The process of washing and filtration occupies about an hour, during which time another charge may be in process of treatment in the <b>chlorinator</b> above. The discharge from the filter and the washings are run into a vat, and from this they are allowed to pass slowly through a tap into a charcoal filter. During the passage of the liquid through the charcoal filter, the chloride of gold is decomposed and the gold is deposited on the charcoal, which, when fully charged, is burnt, the ashes are fused with borax in a crucible, and the gold is obtained.|$|E

[...] The chlorine generator (also known as salt cell, salt generator, salt <b>chlorinator</b> or SWG) uses electrolysis in the presence of dissolved salt (NaCl) to produce hypochlorous acid (HClO) and sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), which are the sanitizing agents already commonly used in swimming pools. As such, a saltwater pool is not actually chlorine-free; it simply utilizes added salt and a chlorine generator instead of direct addition of chlorine.|$|E

Two square, metal-framed windows, covered with metal shutters open into {{both of these}} elevations. A square window into the north-west elevation is also covered with sheeting. The entrance to the building, in the south-east elevation, is via a concrete stair which ascends parallel to the wall finishing at a concrete landing. A wooden door opens from the landing. This is secured with a knob and a more recent lock. The top of the tank under the smaller building forms a raised semicircular concrete plinth which extends to the south-west. The tank contains a chamber with a tapered floor.|$|E
50|$|Saltwater pools {{can also}} require {{stabilizer}} (cyanuric acid) to help stop the sun's UV rays from breaking down free chlorine in the pool. Usual levels are 20 - 50 ppm. They also require the pH {{to be kept}} between 7.2 and 7.8 with the chlorine being more effective if the pH is kept closer to 7.2. The average salt levels are usually in the 3000-5000 ppm range, {{much less than the}} ocean, which has salt levels of around 35,000 parts per million (ppm). Typically, salt is poured across the bottom of the pool and swept with the pool brush until it dissolves; if concentrated brine is allowed into the return-water system it can cause the <b>chlorinator</b> cell to malfunction due to overconductivity.|$|E

An added feature that can be utilized is a <b>chlorinator,</b> which is used to treat water. The charging time of the lamps vary by how long the solar panel is kept in the sun, and the strength of the sunlight on a given day.

5000|$|For {{any system}} of {{chlorination}} yet introduced {{it is necessary}} to free the ore from sulphides. This is done by roasting according to any of the well-known systems in vogue. It is a matter which requires great care and considerable skill. The heat must be applied and increased slowly and steadily. If, through any neglect {{on the part of the}} roaster, the ore is allowed to fuse, in most cases it is best to throw the charge away, as waste. This roasting applies equally to the Vautin process as to any others. So on this head there is no alteration. One of the most important advantages is not a chemical one, but is the rapidity with which the charge can be treated. In the older styles of treatment the time varied from thirty six to ninety hours. Now this is accomplished in from three to six hours with a practically perfect result. The older processes required a careful damping of the ore, which, to get good results, must leave the ore neither too wet nor too dry. Now [...] "damping" [...] is entirely done away with, and in its place water is poured into the barrel. Pressure to the extent of four atmospheres causes chlorine gas to leave its vaporous form. Thus the pressure applied not only enables a strong solution of chlorine to be formed with the water in the barrel, but forces this into contact with the gold through every crevice in the ore. Chlorine gas also takes up any silver which may exist in association with the gold. In the older processes this is deposited as a film of chloride of silver around the fine gold grains, and from its insolubility in water prevents the absorption of the gold. The rotary motion of the barrel in the Newbery-Vautin method counteracts this by continually rubbing the particles together; this frees the particles from any accumulations, so that they always present fresh surfaces for the action of the solvent. Again, the short time the ore is in contact with the chlorine does not allow of the formation of hydrochloric acid, which has a tendency to precipitate the gold from its soluble form in the water before being withdrawn from the <b>chlorinator.</b>|$|E
