40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the benefits of sugar cane ethanol in Brazil, appointing the productivity of this type of fuel based on hectares of plantation, its carbon dioxide cycle and the contribution to reduce the greenhouse effect. In the following step the uses of ethanol for hydrogen production by steam reforming is analyzed and some comparison with natural gas steam reforming is performed. The sugar cane industry in Brazil, in a near future, in the hydrogen era, could be modified according to our purpose, since besides the production of sugar, and ethylic and anhydric alcohol, Brazilian sugar cane industry will also be able to produce biohydrogen. Fuel cells appear like a promising technology for energy generation. Among several technologies in the present, the PEMFC (proton exchange membrane fuel cell) is the most appropriate for vehicles application, because it combines durability, high power density, high efficiency, good response and it works at relatively low temperatures. Besides that it is easy to turn it on and off and it is able to support present vibration in vehicles. A PEMFC's problem is the need of noble catalysts like platinum. Another problem is that CO needs to be in low concentration, requiring a more clean hydrogen to avoid fuel cell deterioration. One part of this paper was developed in Stockholm, where there are some buses within the CUTE (<b>clean</b> <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> for Europe) project that has been in operation with FC since January 2004. Another part was developed in Guaratinguetá, Brazil. Brazil intends to start up a program of FC buses.

The trial was the subject of an Australian study program that included, amongst other analysis areas, an operational analysis and an economic analysis. The scope of this research covered these two research topics and was structured to answer the following questions: 1. What is the minimum data required to successfully evaluate the technical and cost-benefit performance of a new bus technology, compared to the incumbent technology? 2. How did the assessment of the Perth Fuel Cell Bus Trial lead to the development of this methodology? 3. What lessons were learnt from the application of this methodology to the Perth Fuel Cell Bus Trial? 4. How applicable has this approach been to subsequent bus trials? The operational analysis drew on daily reporting on the operation of the EcoBuses. Data was stored and analysed using a database developed for this research. The final database contained 101, 736 separate entries in 14 tables. The economic analysis examined a base case and six scenarios to examine variations in the base case parameters. The method and economic model have been validated in several bus trials since the completion of the Perth fuel cell bus trial. The key results of this study were: • A description of the minimum data required to capture both the performance and operating conditions for a bus trial was developed. The key components were: - financial performance in terms of capital and operating costs and - environmental performance in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and air toxic emissions during production and operation and the social costs of those emissions. • Bus performance, both financial and environmental, is highly dependent on operating conditions. It is critical that the operating conditions are captured to give context to the buses performance. These include passenger loads, terrain, operating distance, traffic conditions, and weather conditions. • In the three year Perth Fuel Cell Bus Trial, the EcoBuses travelled a total of 258, 000 km and consumed an average of 18. 1 kg of hydrogen per 100 km...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, direct {{hydrogen}} Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) {{fuel cell}} systems in vehicles are investigated through modelling, field tests and public acceptance surveys. A computer {{model of a}} 50 kW PEM fuel cell system was developed. The fuel cell system efficiency is approximately 50 % between 10 and 45 % of the rated power. The fuel cell auxiliary system, e. g. compressor and pumps, was shown to clearly affect the overall fuel cell system electrical efficiency. Two hydrogen on-board storage options, compressed and cryogenic hydrogen, were modelled for the above-mentioned system. Results show that the release of compressed gaseous hydrogen needs approximately 1 kW of heat, which can be managed internally with heat from the fuel cell stack. In the case of cryogenic hydrogen, the estimated heat demand of 13 kW requires an extra heat source. A phase change based (PCM) thermal management solution to keep a 50 kW PEM fuel cell stack warm during dormancy in a cold climate (- 20 °C) was investigated through simulation and experiments. It was shown {{that a combination of}} PCM (salt hydrate or paraffin wax) and vacuum insulation materials was able to keep a fuel cell stack from freezing for about three days. This is a simple and potentially inexpensive solution, although development on issues such as weight, volume and encapsulation materials is needed Two different vehicle platforms, fuel cell vehicles and fuel cell hybrid vehicles, were used to study the fuel consumption and the air, water and heat management of the fuel cell system under varying operating conditions, e. g. duty cycles and ambient conditions. For a compact vehicle, with a 50 kW fuel cell system, the fuel consumption was significantly reduced, ~ 50 %, compared to a gasoline-fuelled vehicle of similar size. A bus with 200 kW fuel cell system was studied and compared to a diesel bus of comparable size. The fuel consumption of the fuel cell bus displayed a reduction of 33 - 37 %. The performance of a fuel cell hybrid vehicle, i. e. a 50 kW fuel cell system and a 12 Ah power-assist battery pack in series configuration, was studied. The simulation results show that the vehicle fuel consumption increases with 10 - 19 % when the altitude increases from 0 to 3000 m. As expected, the air compressor with its load-following strategy was found to be the main parasitic power (~ 40 % of the fuel cell system net power output at the altitude of 3000 m). Ambient air temperature and relative humidity affect mostly the fuel cell system heat management but also its water balance. In designing the system, factors such as control strategy, duty cycles and ambient conditions need to taken into account. An evaluation of the performance and maintenance of three fuel cell buses in operation in Stockholm in the demonstration project <b>Clean</b> <b>Urban</b> <b>Transport</b> for Europe (CUTE) was performed. The availability of the buses was high, over 85 % during the summer months and even higher availability during the fall of 2004. Cold climate-caused failures, totalling 9 % of all fuel cell propulsion system failures, did not involve the fuel cell stacks but the auxiliary system. The fuel consumption was however rather high at 7. 5 L diesel equivalents/ 10 km (per July 2004). This is thought to be, to some extent, due to the robust but not energy-optimized powertrain of the buses. Hybridization in future design may have beneficial effects on the fuel consumption. Surveys towards hydrogen and fuel cell technology of more than 500 fuel cell bus passengers on route 66 and 23 fuel cell bus drivers in Stockholm were performed. The passengers were in general positive towards fuel cell buses and felt safe with the technology. Newspapers and bus stops were the main sources of information on the fuel cell bus project, but more information was wanted. Safety, punctuality and frequency were rated as the most important factors in the choice of public transportation means. The environment was also rated as an important factor. More than half of the bus passengers were nevertheless unwilling to pay a higher fee for introducing more fuel cell buses in Stockholm’s public transportation. The drivers were positive to the fuel cell bus project, stating that the fuel cell buses were better than diesel buses with respect to pollutant emissions from the exhausts, smell and general passenger comfort. Also, driving experience, acceleration and general comfort for the driver were reported to be better than or similar to those of a conventional bus. QC 2010102...|$|E

40|$|Most {{individuals}} {{travel in}} order {{to participate in a}} network of activities which are important for attaining a good standard of living. Because such activities are commonly widely dispersed and not located locally, regular access to a vehicle is important to avoid exclusion. However, planning transport system provisions that can engage members of society in an acceptable degree of activity participation remains a great challenge. The main challenges in most cities of the world are due to significant population growth and rapid urbanisation which produces increased demand for transport. Keeping pace with these challenges in most urban areas is difficult due to the widening gap between supply and demand for transport systems which places the urban population at a transport disadvantage. The key element in mitigating the issue of <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> disadvantage is to accurately identify the <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> disadvantaged. Although wide-ranging variables and multi-dimensional methods have been used to identify this group, variables are commonly selected using ad-hoc techniques and unsound methods. This poses questions of whether the current variables used are accurately linked with <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> disadvantage, and the effectiveness of the current policies. To fill these gaps, the research conducted for this thesis develops an operational <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> disadvantage framework (UTDAF) based on key statistical <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> disadvantage variables to accurately identify the <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> disadvantaged. The thesis develops a methodology based on qualitative and quantitative statistical approaches to develop an <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> disadvantage framework designed to accurately identify <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> disadvantage. The reliability and the applicability of the methodology developed is the prime concern rather than the accuracy of the estimations. Relevant concepts that impact on <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> disadvantage identification and measurement and a wide range of <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> disadvantage variables were identified through a review of the existing literature. Based on the reviews, a conceptual <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> disadvantage framework was developed based on the causal theory. Variables identified during the literature review were selected and consolidated based on the recommendations of international and local experts during the Delphi study. Following the literature review, the conceptual <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> disadvantage framework was statistically assessed to identify key variables. Using the statistical outputs, the key variables were weighted and aggregated to form the UTDAF. Before the variable's weights were finalised, they were adjusted based on results of correlation analysis between elements forming the framework to improve the framework's accuracy. The UTDAF was then applied to three contextual conditions to determine the framework's effectiveness in identifying <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> disadvantage.

Because the existing system is largely unregulated, inadequate, rowdy and characteristically unconventional. For instance, standardization in <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles designs and operations are virtually not considered important by the authorities. As a result, women are manhandled, as well as being victims of pick-pockets, muggers while transiting in the metropolitan.

A partial solution of this problem is achieved by the introduction of high-quality public <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> of passengers that enables faster and more efficient transport. Since the introduction of individual forms of public <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> depends on several factors, such as economic, traffic, environmental and technical ones, the problem is often a very complex one. The implementation of trolleybuses represents one of the forms of passenger transportation in public <b>urban</b> <b>transport.</b> It is the most favourable electrical vehicle for public <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> when the implementation of a rail system is not affordable. Looking through history, the trolleybus has experienced significant changes in the implementation, in a large number of world urban environments.
