50|$|Chondrohierax is a genus {{of birds}} of prey in the family Accipitridae. Its two members, the hook-billed kite (C. uncinatus) and the <b>Cuban</b> <b>kite</b> (C. wilsonii), are often {{considered}} to be conspecific. The hook-billed kite is widespread in the warmer parts of the Americas, while the <b>Cuban</b> <b>kite</b> is a critically endangered Cuban endemic.|$|E
50|$|The {{critically}} endangered <b>Cuban</b> <b>kite,</b> C. wilsonii, {{is considered}} by some authors to be a subspecies of the hook-billed kite.|$|E
50|$|Protographium celadon, the <b>Cuban</b> <b>kite</b> swallowtail, is a {{butterfly}} {{of the family}} Papilionidae. It is endemic to Cuba. Occasional strays {{can be found on}} the Florida Keys.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cuban</b> <b>kite</b> (Chondrohierax wilsonii) is a {{bird of prey}} in {{the family}} Accipitridae which also {{includes}} many other diurnal raptors such as kites, eagles and harriers. It is endemic to Cuba.|$|E
50|$|Endemic birds {{include the}} olive-capped warbler (Dendroica pityophila), <b>Cuban</b> <b>kite</b> (Chondrohierax wilsonii), Cuban trogon (Priotelus temnurus), Cuban amazon, (Amazona leucocephala) and Cuban tody (Todus multicolor). The Cuban ivory-billed {{woodpecker}} (Campephilus principalis bairdii) may remain in eastern pine forests, but is probably extinct.|$|E
50|$|The West Indies Project {{focuses on}} raptors found {{only on the}} Caribbean Islands. Current {{research}} and conservation efforts are directed at the critically endangered Ridgway's hawk in the Dominican Republic, the Puerto Rican Sharp-shinned Hawk, the Grenada hook-billed kite confined to the island of Grenada, and the <b>Cuban</b> <b>kite,</b> endemic to Cuba and among the rarest species of raptor in the world.|$|E
50|$|The reserve extends along 2083.05 km2, {{of which}} 60.13 km2 to the marine area. Cuchillas del Toa is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} principal centers of biodiversity and endemism in Cuba and the insular Caribbean with pine forests, cloud forests and xeric scrub to complex coastal vegetation with mangroves and coral reefs. The karstic system of the great cave of Moa Head lands is one of the five natural monuments in the country and one of the great cave systems in eastern Cuba. With high biodiversity in flora and fauna, there are 928 endemic species reported, including primitive species belonging to the genera Podocarpus and Dracaena. Cuchillas del Toa is home to the highly endangered Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis bairdii), <b>Cuban</b> <b>kite</b> (Chondrohierax wilsoni), and the Cuban solenodon (Solenodon cubanus). Some of the world’s smallest mammal species are found in the reserve. About 18,300 inhabitants (2002), in 498 communities, live in the buffer zone and transition area of this mountainous reserve. Engaged in forestry, traditional agriculture (coffee, coconut, and cacao) and ecotourism, they also raise cattle and participate in nickel, chromium, iron and cobalt mining. These activities had increased negative impacts in the carrying capacity of the ecosystems, one of the main problems the reserve faces today. Another interesting aspect of this biosphere reserve is its history as battlefield for freedom. In the 18th and 19th centuries, escaped African slaves called Cimmarones found refuge in the region. It is twinned with the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico, due to similar environmental conditions and resource management.|$|E
40|$|Taxonomic {{uncertainties}} {{within the}} genus Chondrohierax {{stem from the}} high degree of variation in bill size and plumage coloration throughout the geographic range of the single recognized species, hook-billed kite Chondrohierax uncinatus. These uncertainties impede conservation efforts as local populations have declined throughout much of its geographic range from the Neotropics in Central America to northern Argentina and Paraguay, including two island populations on Cuba and Grenada, and it is not known whether barriers to dispersal exist between any of these areas. Here, we present mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA; cytochrome B and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2) phylogenetic analyses of Chondrohierax, with particular emphasis on the two island taxa (from Cuba, Chondrohierax uncinatus wilsonii and from Grenada, Chondrohierax uncinatus mirus). The mtDNA phylogenetic results suggest that hook-billed kites on both islands are unique; however, the <b>Cuban</b> <b>kite</b> has much greater divergence estimates (1. 8 – 2. 0 % corrected sequence divergence) when compared with the mainland populations than does the Grenada hook-billed kite (0. 1 – 0. 3 %). Our findings support species status for the Cuban form, as Chondrohierax wilsonii, and subspecific status for the Grenada form. For mainland taxa, we do not find support for the currently recognized subspecies Chondrohierax uncinatus aquilonis in western Mexico, but we do find evidence for a genetic subdivision between populations in Central and South America, a difference previously unsuspected. The results of this study help identify conservation priorities associated with these unique Neotropical raptors. This information is of immediate interest because the <b>Cuban</b> <b>kite</b> has not been reliably seen since 1992, and < 50 hook-billed kites currently inhabit Grenada...|$|E
