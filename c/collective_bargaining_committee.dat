25|$|Although his wire bending job {{was only}} {{supposed}} to be summer employment, Bieber stayed and did not go on to college. Bieber was elected a shop steward of Local 687 (which covered Grand Rapids {{and most of the}} immediate surrounding area) in 1949, and in 1951 was elected to the local's executive board. He was elected to Local 687's <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>committee</b> in 1955, and became the local's president in 1956.

Although Putnam ruled out price relief based on a rise in wages, {{for the first time}} he and OPS director DiSalle indicated that the government would permit the steel manufacturers to seek the maximum price increase allowed by the Capehart Amendment. Cyrus Ching, now head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, sent two of his top aides to meet with union officials to determine the union's bargaining strategy and timeline. The aides met with Murray and the union's <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>committee</b> on December 14, but made no headway. WSB director Feinsinger, however, began paving the way for a relaxation of Wage Regulation 6. On December 8, Feinsinger told the press that the Board was already working on a revision to the regulation which would permit merit pay increases. Five days later, Feinsinger let it be known that a number of economic issues (such as increased pension contributions) might be removed from the calculation of the basic wage rate in order to relieve the pressure on the negotiating parties.|$|E

40|$|This book is an {{analysis}} of the relationship among <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining,</b> firm competitiveness, and employment protection/creation in the United States. <b>Collective</b> <b>bargaining,</b> at its essence, is the determination of terms and conditions of employment through negotiation between an employer and a representative of the employer’s employees acting collectively as a group; hence the term <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining.</b> Although <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> is generally contrasted with individual bargaining, {{for the vast majority of}} employees in the United States, the alternative to <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> is unilateral determination of terms and conditions of employment by the employer, with perhaps a small zone of negotiations over wages or salaries and/or job duties.

Our findings suggest that the positive correlation between export status and <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> can be explained through size.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of opening causes in collective wage agreements allowing firms {{to deviate from}} their <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> agreements has become widely accepted for the last fifteen years. With respect to the flexibility agreed through <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining,</b> the distinctions between single <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> areas of the same industry have increased. Hence, the economic idea of uniform industry-wide central <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> agreements is no longer tenable. The data set of the IAW used in this article provides differentiated information about opening clauses in collective wage agreements. By means of correspondence and cluster analysis, seven groups of <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> areas are identified, which differ {{in the type of}} opening clauses introduced. Over the period from 1991 until 2004, the examination of dynamic aspects to these seven groups exhibits typical paths of development towards an improved flexibility agreed through <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining.</b> Furthermore, the conjunction of the data set with the German Structure of Earnings Survey of the years 1995 and 2001 makes it possible to show the relevance of the different types of single <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> areas for employment and industries of the German manufacturing sector.
