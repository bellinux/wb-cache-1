50|$|Conductor gallop is the high-amplitude, low-frequency {{oscillation}} of {{overhead power}} lines due to wind. The movement of the wires occur most commonly in the vertical plane, although horizontal or rotational motion is also possible. The natural frequency mode tends to be around 1 Hz, leading the often graceful periodic motion to also be known as <b>conductor</b> <b>dancing.</b> The oscillations can exhibit amplitudes in excess of a metre, and the displacement is sometimes sufficient for the phase conductors to infringe operating clearances (coming too close to other objects), and causing flashover. The forceful motion also adds significantly to the loading stress on insulators and electricity pylons, raising the risk of mechanical failure of either.|$|E
5000|$|... "Fool's Overture" [...] was {{the closing}} song on Supertramp's 1977, 1979 and 1983 tours before the encore. It {{is still the}} case for Hodgson's 2010 solo tour. When this song was played live, a video of World War II would be shown during the Winston Churchill speech and another film of bombs and houses {{exploding}} before the grand finale of the song. During the song's finale, the band decided to [...] "go crazy" [...] by bringing on stage Superman, a holy man, band member John Heliwell in his Spider-Man glasses plus a <b>conductor's</b> jacket, <b>dancing</b> gorillas, cops, robbers, Indians, a banana, Charlie Chaplin, Miss Piggy (as seen on the Live in Paris '79 concert film) and an Adolf Hitler look-alike. During the music explosion/Jerusalem section of the piece, when performed live from 1977 to 1983, John Helliwell would play a different saxophone solo each performance with some ranging from [...] "The Star Spangled Banner" [...] to [...] "When Johnny Comes Marching Home" [...] to just a plain saxophone doodle. A live version of the song, recorded in 1979, {{is included in the}} Paris live album. The song has less frequently appeared on live setlists following the 1983 tour because of Hodgson's departure.|$|R
6000|$|Assuming that he {{had come}} upon a colony of Greenies, and feeling assured that such tiny beings could not injure him, even if anxious to do so, Roger walked on with his <b>conductor,</b> the band <b>dancing</b> in a {{progressing}} circle in front of them, until a wood was reached, when the dancers broke up the ring and advanced in single file between the trees. The light grew more and more dim, and when the cavalcade reached the entrance to a cavern, Roger could hardly discern the Greenies. Clinging to the little hand of his guide, however, the undaunted fisherman entered the cave, and groped his way down a flight of mossy steps. Suddenly he found himself in a beautiful glade, in which hundreds of little figures closely resembling his escort, and wearing dainty red caps, were disporting themselves and singing-- ...|$|R
