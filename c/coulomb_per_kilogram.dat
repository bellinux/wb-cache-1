50|$|In physics, the {{gyromagnetic ratio}} (also {{sometimes}} {{known as the}} magnetogyric ratio in other disciplines) of a particle or system is the ratio of its magnetic moment to its angular momentum, and it is often denoted by the symbol γ, gamma. Its SI unit is the radian per second per tesla (rad&sdot;s−1&sdot;T−1) or, equivalently, the <b>coulomb</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> (C&sdot;kg−1).|$|E

50|$|When the National Resistance Movement {{seized power}} in 1986, Museveni set high {{priorities}} on improving coffee production, {{reducing the amount}} of coffee smuggled into neighbouring countries, and diversifying export crops to reduce Uganda's dependence on world coffee prices.

The 1987 increase came after the Coffee Marketing Board launched an aggressive program to increase export volumes.
