40|$|The {{goal of the}} <b>Crossmedia</b> {{showcase}} is to untie {{the game}} experience both from geographical location and media channels, to provide a virtual story and game space which is accessible anytime, anywhere. These games have the potential of involving a large audience in the story and game play, as several media streams including interactive TV can be combined for content presentation and game participation. These guidelines are developed and used {{in the course of}} the design of a first prototype of a <b>crossmedia</b> game. The focus of this prototype lies on providing a game area that is combined from a physical geographical area with a virtual representation. Thus players can have virtual experience through their physical presence. Challenges are posed by the seamless or seamful integration of a number of devices into such a trans-reality game environment. The form of participation of a player may depend on the devices available and used. Collaboration across devices and across physical and virtual game play should be facilitated in a <b>crossmedia</b> game. This document introduces into the design of <b>crossmedia</b> games with special attention to trans-reality aspects. It outlines the challenges of <b>crossmedia</b> games and research theme...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{draws on}} Bakhtin’s term ‘heteroglossia’ to help sketch {{out a new}} {{conception}} of <b>crossmedia</b> practice, which while recognising distinct media as ‘utterances’, also celebrates a renewed dialogism between them. We will suggest that media that were once seen as separate, have always been intimately connected, and that {{a study of the}} texts produced by this connectivity (such as adaptations and paratexts) can illuminate complex interactions. Recent developments in digital media have resulted in a great deal of <b>crossmedia</b> innovation. With shifts towards synchronous media consumption, and its immersive multi-attentional possibilities, through to transmediality, and the way it reshapes both producer and user practices, <b>crossmedia</b> extends the very idea of ‘media’; in many ways, it could even be said to have become textual itself. These changes have significant pedagogic implications, with a medium specific view of media being myopic and limiting in what it can offer students in an increasingly <b>crossmedia</b> world. Media education privileges existent academic silos, and curricula are therefore skewed toward a particular medium. We will suggest this distorts critical perspectives of crossmedia; a film studies scholar for example will view <b>crossmedia</b> through the historical and theoretical lens of cinema, yet cinema as an industrial practice now revels in its crossmediality. Even those that recognise the collapse of the normative media paradigm (e. g. Bennett et al. 2011) expend their energies discussing industrial or audience transformations, yet fail to acknowledge the need for parallel changes in media education. Drawing on current industry practices, this chapter will call for a new pedagogy which allows for a position whereby <b>crossmedia</b> events are not seen as an array of loosely connected and interrelated texts, that are examined within now outmoded academic silos, but as a type of ‘digital heteroglossia’ where different media are seen as ‘utterances’ (or voices) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{delivery}} of fiction across multiple platforms; cinema, television, web and mobile devices now defines the contemporary broadcasting landscape. The illumination of this nascent {{area will be}} through the consideration of two contemporary <b>crossmedia</b> examples: The Truth About Marika (2007, Sweden Dir: Christopher Sandberg & Martin Erikkson) and The Inside (2011, USA, Dir: DJ Caruso). Both examples deployed multiple content delivery platforms {{in order to create}} their respective narrative experiences and both offered the audience opportunities for real-time involvement within the stories to the point where in some cases audience members perceived the fiction to be real. These explications will be preceded by a summary of the evolution of narrative techniques within screen media and their associated critique. This will be followed by an exploration into the definitions of <b>crossmedia</b> fictions, and an overview of the broad spectrum of the varying intensities of <b>crossmedia</b> forms. The chapter draws upon the study of narrative and film as well as being informed by the contemporary studies of transmedia and convergence. The chapter ultimately contends that {{with the advent of the}} <b>crossmedia</b> fictional form comes the emergence and evolution of new storytelling grammars, styles and aesthetics, alongside an advancement of the language and frameworks for their subsequent study...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Many {{interactive}} systems today span {{across a}} range of interoperable IT artifacts, forming <b>crossmedia</b> systems. They aim at providing pervasive and synergistic support for human activities. This paper reports a three-month-long qualitative field study exploring the use of a <b>crossmedia</b> fitness system to support physical training. The main concern is how the system – through the configuration of its components – supports the primary activity. Users ’ primary motivation, elaborateness of their activities, internalization or externalization of their actions and their perceived threshold toward using distinct IT artifacts determined the utilization of the system and each of its components. Compositional aspects of the system, such as its hierarchical structure, distribution of functionality and functional modularity influenced its ability to support different ways of training. The article contributes by shedding light on aspects that influence the synergistic use of IT artifacts and by proposing implications for designing <b>crossmedia</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we present the {{procedures}} and outcomes of adopting two roles in a study: {{the role of}} a researcher and {{the role of a}} designer. The subject is <b>crossmedia</b> design. <b>Crossmedia</b> is a growing and changing trend for media producers of today its design is of great importance. The purpose is to create a concept from scratch that stands out from the crowd and engage people with the use of cross media as the approach. We also aim to investigate if a cross media designer can rely on previous research made within this subject or if the scene has changed. In order to test and to fully understand the process of the subject, we designed a <b>crossmedia</b> concept, based upon previous and related research. We employ a qualitative and exploratory approach informed by recent developments in action design research. We will then review our results by analysing which medium, digital or analogue, was the most successful and how the audience and the general media embraced the concept...|$|E

40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Informática (Engenharia Informática), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências, 2014 Video is a {{very rich}} medium, in {{cognitive}} and affective terms, to convey information and support learning and entertainment like no other medium, and TV is a privileged way to watch it. However, by being traditionally watched in a more experiential and passive cognitive mode, TV and video are limited in their capacity to fully support learning so important in the lifelong learning era where learning {{is taking place in}} a wide variety of contexts and locations that calls for flexible environments. TV and video are limited in their capacity to fully support learning but may induce viewers to engage in more reflective modes, that can be supported to some extent by their adequate design, in interactive contexts and augmented by other media and devices, in diverse situations. The inclusion of iTV that has been gaining increasing attention from researchers, and practitioners, in the last few years, as part of rich and flexible <b>crossmedia</b> environments brings new opportunities in this respect. This situation justifies our research main goal to efficiently and flexibly support users learning informal opportunities created in video-based <b>crossmedia</b> environments, taking into account the different cognitive modes, contexts of use and taking advantage of the diverse devices being used in order to have each device contributing with what it does best. In order to illustrate, explore and validate our research, the eiTV application was conceptualized, prototyped and evaluated. It is capable to create videobased <b>crossmedia</b> informal learning environments, created as additional information to the video being watched, initially via iTV. These environments are accessed from iTV, PC and mobile devices (the most commonly used in <b>crossmedia</b> scenarios), depending on the preferred or most adequate device in each context of use.
