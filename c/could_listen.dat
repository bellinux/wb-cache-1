5|$|The Student and Instructor {{models were}} also {{introduced}} in the late 1960s. They were designed to teach the piano in the classroom. By connecting the output {{of a network of}} student models, the teacher <b>could</b> <b>listen</b> to each student in isolation on the instructor model, and send an audio backing track to them. This allowed the teacher to monitor individual students' progress.|$|E
5|$|Fan {{interest}} in attending games had begun declining throughout MLB in the late-1940s, and the Yankees faced a drop-off in their crowds after 1947, when they sold about 2.2 million tickets. By 1957, season attendance was down by over 700,000. New York baseball fans {{had the option}} of watching games on television instead by the early 1950s. The Yankees joined the other New York City franchises in allowing game telecasts. This was a departure from the team's strategy when radio broadcasts were introduced. Regular season games of the Yankees were not broadcast until 1939, as management believed that fewer fans would attend games if they <b>could</b> <b>listen</b> on radios.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{team had}} access to Codemasters' full audio library, which was composed of sound assets dating from the first Colin McRae Rally (1998) up to Grid 2 (2013). On a case-by-case basis, they decided whether to reuse existing sounds or update them. The result {{was a combination of}} audio from various games; suspensions sounds were taken from Dirt 3, wind, gearbox and mechanical samples from Colin McRae Rally 2005, garage sounds from , and music from Colin McRae Rally 04. One aspect of the audio that was kept intact was the original pacenotes read by professional co-driver Nicky Grist. The team did not want to disrupt the timing and delivery of critical track information so they opted to use the original recordings in this case. Support for custom soundtracks was added so that players <b>could</b> <b>listen</b> to their own music in-game.|$|E

25|$|Radio Luxembourg {{was one of}} few {{channels}} {{through which}} {{people living in the}} Eastern Bloc <b>could</b> <b>listen</b> to rock and other contemporary popular music. Under good weather conditions, and especially at night, people as far as eastern Czechoslovakia and Estonia <b>could</b> <b>listen</b> to the station. Eastern Bloc governments did not use jammers to prevent people from listening to Radio Luxembourg, but did do so for Radio Free Europe and, since the stations used harmonic frequencies (1439kHz for Luxembourg and 719kHz for Free Europe), the jamming also affected Radio Luxembourg's signal. Even though western popular music was considered undesirable by socialist regimes, legal prosecution was rare, although not unheard of. The music appealed to young people as something forbidden, and listening to it became a social ritual. It also strongly influenced contemporary underground culture and music in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{users with}} free {{accounts}} <b>could</b> <b>listen</b> to 40 hours of music a month, and could pay $.99 {{per month for}} unlimited streaming. In September 2011, Pandora removed the 40-hour listening limit. This 40-hour limit on free listening was re-introduced in March 2013 for mobile devices. However, this limit was removed once more on September of the same year.|$|E

25|$|In Guernsey in 1940, the Germans proposed, {{instead of}} letters, {{to record a}} message to be {{transmitted}} by them over a radio so that people in Britain <b>could</b> <b>listen.</b> The message recorded by Ambrose Sherwill was broadcast and caused controversy as it mentioned the exemplary conduct of the German soldiers and how the population was being well looked after. This was not the way Churchill wished the Germans to be perceived, but would have provided comfort to islanders in Britain.|$|E
25|$|The Guardian {{reported}} on 4 July 2011 that Scotland Yard had discovered Dowler's voicemail had been accessed by journalists {{working for the}} News of the World and the newspaper's private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. The Guardian also reported that, during the police investigation into that newspaper's phone hacking activities, detectives discovered that journalists had deleted some messages—potential evidence—in Dowler's voicemail box because it was full, in order to free up space for new messages, to which they <b>could</b> <b>listen.</b> The deletions after Dowler was missing led family and friends {{to think that she}} was still alive. It was later reported that Dowler's phone automatically deleted messages 72 hours after they were listened to.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{economic}} calamity facing {{the nation and}} his dim hopes for re-election, Hoover faced little opposition for re-nomination at the 1932 Republican National Convention. Some Republicans talked of nominating Coolidge, former Vice President Charles Dawes, or Senator Hiram Johnson, but all passed on the opportunity to challenge Hoover. Curtis was re-nominated as Hoover's running mate. Franklin D. Roosevelt won the presidential nomination on the third ballot of the 1932 Democratic National Convention, defeating the 1928 Democratic nominee, Al Smith. Speaker of the House John Nance Garner was nominated as Roosevelt's running mate. By 1932, the radio was in 12 million homes, changing the nature of presidential campaigns. No longer could presidents change {{the content of their}} speeches for each audience; anyone with a radio <b>could</b> <b>listen</b> to every major speech.|$|E

And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I <b>could</b> <b>listen</b> to her all the time.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, Martin {{launched}} his weekly NBC comedy-variety series, The Dean Martin Show, which ran for 264 episodes until 1974. He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy in 1966 and was nominated again {{the following three}} years. The show exploited his image as a carefree boozer. Martin capitalized on his laid-back persona of the half-drunk crooner, hitting on women with remarks that would get anyone else slapped, and making snappy if slurred remarks about fellow celebrities during his roasts. During an interview on the British TV documentary Wine, Women and Song, aired in 1983, he stated, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that he had someone record them on cassette tape so he <b>could</b> <b>listen</b> to them. His TV show was a success. The show's loose format featured quick-witted improvisation from Martin and his weekly guests. This prompted a battle between Martin and NBC censors, who insisted on more scrutiny of the content. The show was often in the Top Ten. Martin, appreciative of the show's producer, his friend Greg Garrison, made a handshake deal giving Garrison, a pioneer TV producer in the 1950s, 50% of the show. However, the validity of that ownership {{is the subject of}} a lawsuit brought by NBCUniversal.|$|E

Annie was {{influenced}} by 1980s dance-pop, and on [...] "No Easy Love", she includes a sample of Shakatak's 1982 song [...] "Easier Said Than Done". Unlike many of her contemporaries, Annie avoids using an ironic or kitschy in her take on 1980s music. The songs' styles span genres including bubblegum pop, electro, disco, R, dance-pop, and rock. Annie's DJing experiences taught her about sound and production and affected her music. She stated {{that she wanted to}} make a pop album that would not quickly become dated, [...] "an album that you <b>could</b> <b>listen</b> to in five years and it wouldn't sound terrible." [...] Annie considered excluding [...] "Greatest Hit" [...] from Anniemal to achieve this but ultimately included it because she felt it did not sound as if it were five years old.|$|E
