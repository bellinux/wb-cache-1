40|$|The paper {{presents}} the kinematics of mutual movement of an {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAV) and a ground target. The <b>controlled</b> observation and <b>tracking</b> <b>head</b> (OTH) is a device responsible for observing the ground, searching for a ground target, and tracking it. The preprogrammed movement of the UAV on the circle with the simultaneous movement of the head axis on Archimedes’ spiral during searching for a ground target, both fixed (bunkers, rocket missiles launching positions, etc.) and movable (tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, etc.), is considered. Dynamics of OTH during {{the performance of the}} above mentioned activities is examined. Some research results are presented in a graphical form...|$|R
40|$|Head {{control was}} {{compared}} with manual control in a pursuit tracking task involving proportional controlled-element dynamics. An integrated control/display system {{was used to}} explore tracking effectiveness in horizontal and vertical axes tracked singly and concurrently. Compared with manual <b>tracking,</b> <b>head</b> <b>tracking</b> resulted in a 50 percent greater rms error score, lower pilot gain, greater high-frequency phase lag and greater low-frequency remnant. These differences were statistically significant, but differences between horizontal- and vertical-axis tracking and between 1 - and 2 -axis tracking were generally small and not highly significant. Manual tracking results were matched with the optimal control model using pilot-related parameters typical of those found in previous manual <b>control</b> studies. <b>Head</b> <b>tracking</b> performance was predicted with good accuracy using the manual tracking model plus a model for head/neck response dynamics obtained from the literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{evaluation}} of a control system, which can be utilised for the automatic guidance of large ships in confined or restricted waters, is investigated. The vessel {{is assumed to be}} a multivariable system and it is demonstrated that a non-linear, time-varying mathematical model most accurately describes the motion of the hull, particularly in tight manoeuvres. A discrete optimal controller has been designed to <b>control</b> simultaneously <b>track,</b> <b>heading</b> and forward velocity. The system is most effective whilst operating under a dual-mode policy. It is shown that feedback matrix adaption is necessary to deal with changes in forward velocity and a form of gain scheduling is proposed. Active disturbance control is employed to counteract effects of wind and tide. An inertial navigation system, together with an optimal controller and filter, is installed on-board a car ferry model. Free-sailing tests show that the performance characteristics of the system are in accordance with theoretical predictions. The feasibility of implementation on a full-size vessel is considered.

40|$|Head coupled {{perspective}} is often {{considered to be}} an essential aspect of stereoscopic desktop virtual reality (VR) systems. Such systems use a tracking device to determine the user's head pose in up to six degrees of freedom (DOF). Users of desktop VR systems perform their task while sitting down and therefore the extent of head movements is limited. This paper investigates the validity of using a <b>head</b> <b>tracking</b> system for desktop VR that only <b>tracks</b> lateral <b>head</b> movement. Users performed a depth estimation task under full (six DOF) <b>head</b> <b>tracking,</b> lateral <b>head</b> <b>tracking,</b> and disabled <b>head</b> <b>tracking.</b> Furthermore, we considered stereoscopic and monoscopic viewing. Our results show that user performance was not signi cantly affected when incorporating only lateral head motion.

50|$|A <b>control</b> <b>track</b> is a {{track that}} runs along an outside {{edge of a}} {{standard}} analog videotape (including VHS). The <b>control</b> <b>track</b> encodes a series of pulses, each pulse corresponding {{to the beginning of}} each frame. This allows the video tape player to synchronize its scan speed and tape speed to the speed of the recording. Thus, the recorded <b>control</b> <b>track</b> defines the speed of playback (e.g. SP, LP, EP, etc.), and it is also what drives the relative counter clock that most VCRs have.|$|R
50|$|Audio {{cannot be}} {{recorded}} on a VHS tape without recording a video signal, {{even in the}} audio dubbing mode. If there is no video signal to the VCR input, most VCRs will record black video as well as generate a <b>control</b> <b>track</b> while the audio is being recorded. Some early VCRs would record audio without a <b>control</b> <b>track</b> signal, but this was of little practical use since {{the absence of a}} <b>control</b> <b>track</b> signal meant that the linear tape speed was irregular during playback.|$|R
