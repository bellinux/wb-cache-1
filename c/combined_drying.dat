50|$|The {{emission}} behaviour of {{the individual}} elements in the clinker burning process {{is determined by the}} input scenario, the behaviour in the plant and the precipitation efficiency of the dust collection device. The trace elements introduced into the burning process via the raw materials and fuels may evaporate completely or partially in the hot zones of the preheater and/or rotary kiln depending on their volatility, react with the constituents present in the gas phase, and condense on the kiln feed in the cooler sections of the kiln system. Depending on the volatility and the operating conditions, this may result in the formation of cycles that are either restricted to the kiln and the preheater or include the <b>combined</b> <b>drying</b> and grinding plant as well. Trace elements from the fuels initially enter the combustion gases, but are emitted to an extremely small extent only owing to the retention capacity of the kiln and the preheater.|$|E
40|$|A {{large part}} of the grain {{produced}} in the South Urals has high humidity and needs to be dried before storage. Drying is an energy-intensive process and is about 70 % of the total energy consumption for post-harvest processing of grain. Modern grain drying equip¬ment, implements high-convection drying, and heat provides cost 5 350 – 5 500 kJ per 1 kg of evaporated moisture, which is well above the theoretical calculations. <b>Combined</b> <b>drying,</b> which involves high-temperature drying step and aeration enables to reduce heat costs up to 30 %. To control the <b>combined</b> <b>drying</b> process it is necessary that final grain moisture relates to such parameters of high-temperature drying and aeration as the initial moisture content, the temperature of grain and the time subsequent aering. The paper describes the said relation as a mathematical model of the second order obtained experi¬mentally for wheat. The model has been derived from the implementation of Box-Benkin plan for three factors – the initial grain moisture, temperature and time of grain heating and aering. The experiment was conducted for a 200 mm thick fixed grain bed. We also have got a model relating energy consumption to the said parameters. The model of the final grain moisture within the variation of factors can be used to create a control algorithm for <b>combined</b> <b>drying.</b> Taking as the set parameters final moisture, initial moisture and grain heating temperature, a microcontroller calculates the time for active aering necessary to obtain final grain moisture and an unloading mechanism provides the necessary time through regulating the discharge rate. The model makes it possible to calculate the energy usage for drying at different values of initial moisture, temperature and time of grain heating and aering...|$|E

The drying rate of combination drying, the shrinkage, rehydration ratio, and sensory properties, such as the color and trimness, of the dried product in the AD–FD method are measured.

The green lumber was dried and heat-treated in SHS conditions of 250  °C and 0.5  MPa for 18  h, and the relative percentage contents of sugars, lignin, and extractives were investigated and compared with the relative percentage contents in the lumber heat-treated in hot air conditions of 250  °C and atmospheric pressure for 18  h.

The results showed that an electrode gap of 15. 5 cm and a hot air temperature of 50 °C provided an acceptable heating rate and stable sample temperatures, and were used for further drying tests.

In {{the first part}} of the thesis the experimental aspects are detailed. The test apparatus has been commissioned by retro-fitting a radio frequency (rf) generator to the drying chamber of an existing heat pump dryer. A dynamic weighing system has been built and forms the central part of an extensive drying process data acquisition system. A number of practical difficulties due to thermal effects associated with drying and high frequency electromagnetic interference have been addressed. Drying results of the combination system are presented, including those obtained by a novel application of pulsed rf energy in association with heat pump technology for the drying of wet particulates and green house bricks. Limitations of the original experimental apparatus are highlighted and solutions given. A test cell, specially designed and built for carrying out dielectric property measurements of the processed materials, has produced good repeatable results. In the second part of the thesis a theoretical scheme is presented based upon the balance equations of the 'volume averaged' drying load for a modelling of the <b>combined</b> <b>drying</b> process.
