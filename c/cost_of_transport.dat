Lufttransport replaced the helicopter service with a two-engine five-seat aircraft in 1989, which cut the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> significantly. In 1993, Widerøe established itself at Svalbard Airport and flew services to Ny-Ålesund, but this only lasted the one season. In 1996, Lufttransport and Kings Bay made an agreement that the airline would fly once per week during the winter and up to five times per week during the summer. The airline would use a Dornier Do 228, which was also used for flights from Longyearbyen to Svea Airport for Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani.|$|E
5|$|Sabah {{currently}} receives 5% oil royalty (percentage of {{oil production}} {{paid by the}} mining company to the lease owner) from Petronas over oil explorations in Sabah territorial waters based on the 1974 Petroleum Development Act. Majority of {{the oil and gas}} deposits are located on Sabah Trough basin in the west coast side. Sabah was also given a 10% stake in Petronas liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Bintulu, Sarawak. Income inequality and the high cost living remain the major economic issues in Sabah. The high cost living has been blamed on the Cabotage Policy, although the cause was due to the smaller trade volumes, <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> and efficiency of port to handle trade. The government has set to review the Cabotage Policy even thought the cause was due to other reasons with the World Bank has stated that the result was due to weak distribution channels, high handling charges and inefficient inland transportation. It was finally agreed to exempt the policy from 1 June 2017; with foreign ships will go directly to ports in the East without need to go to West Malaysia although Cabotage Policy on transshipment of goods within Sabah and Sarawak and the federal territory of Labuan remain. Prime Minister Najib also promised to narrow development gap between Sabah and the Peninsular by improving and built more infrastructures in the state. Based on a latest record, the total unemployment in the state have been reduced from 5.1% (2014) to 4.7% (2015), although the number of unemployment was still high. Slum is almost non-existent in Malaysia but due to the high number of refugees arriving from the troubling southern Philippines, Sabah has since saw a significant rise on its numbers. To eliminate water pollution and improve a better hygiene, the Sabah state government are working to relocate them into a better housing settlement. As part of the BIMP-EAGA, Sabah also continued to position itself as a main gateway for regional investments. Foreign investment are mainly concentrated in the Kota Kinabalu Industrial Park (KKIP) areas. Although country such as Japan have mainly focusing their various development and investment projects in the interior and islands since after the end of Second World War. Following America's abandonment in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPPA) economic agreements in early 2017, Sabah began to turns its trade to China and India markets.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most common}} metric of energy use during {{locomotion}} is the net [...] <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport,</b> {{defined as the}} amount of energy (e.g., Joules) needed above baseline metabolic rate to move a given distance. [...] For aerobic locomotion, most animals have a nearly constant <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> - moving a given distance requires the same caloric expenditure, regardless of speed. [...] This constancy is usually accomplished by changes in gait. [...] The net <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> of swimming is lowest, followed by flight, with terrestrial limbed locomotion being the most expensive per unit distance. [...] However, because of the speeds involved, flight requires the most energy per unit time. [...] This does not mean that an animal that normally moves by running would be a more efficient swimmer; however, these comparisons assume an animal is specialized for that form of motion. Another consideration here is body massheavier animals, though using more total energy, require less energy per unit mass to move. Physiologists generally measure energy use by the amount of oxygen consumed, or the amount of carbon dioxide produced, in an animal's respiration. In terrestrial animals, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> is typically measured while they walk or run on a motorized treadmill, either wearing a mask to capture gas exchange or with the entire treadmill enclosed in a metabolic chamber. For small rodents, such as deer mice, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> has also been measured during voluntary wheel running.|$|E
2500|$|Energy {{efficiency}} in level-ground transport is quantified {{in terms of}} the dimensionless [...] "specific cost of transport", which is the amount of energy required to carry a unit weight a unit distance. Passive dynamic walkers such as the Cornell Efficient Biped have the same specific <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> as humans, 0.20. Not incidentally, passive dynamic walkers have human-like gaits.

2500|$|Metabolic cost is {{naturally}} optimized by {{selection of a}} nominal gait. [...] While external factors such as instability and perceived dangers may temporarily alter the body’s priorities, {{the primary goal of}} minimizing a task-dependent energetic expenditure ultimately dominates the determination of preferred walking gait. [...] As a result, humans tend to select a preferred walking speed that minimizes their <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport.</b> The relationship between walking and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> is parabola-like with the preferred walking speed at the minimum, meaning walking at a slower or faster speed can incur a similar increase in energetic cost for a 1-kilometer walk. Within each walking speed, the step length and cadence are also optimized for metabolic cost. [...] While multiple proportional combinations of step length and cadence can be used to achieve the same walking speed, taking faster and shorter steps or slower and longer steps than the optimal combination leads to increased <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport.</b>|$|E

This mode of movement has the same net <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> (calories burned per meter moved) as running in lizards of the same mass.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{multiple}} distinct gait parameters have {{a significant}} impact on the energetic cost of walking, each of these parameters have to be considered when examining the primary goal of metabolic cost optimization. [...] The visualization of such an optimization for walking speed, cadence, and step length can be expressed in the form of a contour map, in which parameter combinations that lie on the same contour line share the same <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> (cal/kg/m). [...] The green, red, and blue, dotted lines represent values where cadence, walking speed, and step length are constrained, respectively. [...] These lines can be formed by finding the tangent points that lines representative of several constant parameter values form with the constant COT contours. [...] For example, the optimal COT's for constrained walking speeds (red) can be found by drawing vertical lines and noting where they form a tangent with a contour, as seen with point B in the diagram. [...] A series of these intersections can then form the curve for optimal COT under constrained walking speed. [...] These constrained optimization values not only reflect the naturally selected preferred gait parameters that are observed by fixing a single parameter at different values, but also form part of a predictive map that allows for the identification of the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> for a multivariate system.|$|E
2500|$|Speed {{generally}} governs gait selection, with quadrupedal mammals {{moving from}} a walk to a run to a gallop as speed increases.

[...] Gait transitions occur near the speed where {{the cost of a}} fast walk becomes higher than the cost of a slow run. [...] Unrestrained animals will typically move at the optimum speed for their gait to minimize energy cost. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> is used to compare the energetics of different gaits, as well as the gaits of different animals.|$|E
