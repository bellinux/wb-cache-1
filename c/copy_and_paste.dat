25|$|Accelerators are {{a form of}} selection-based search {{which allow}} a user to invoke an online service from any other page using only the mouse. Actions such as {{selecting}} the text or other objects will give users access to the usable Accelerator services (such as blogging with the selected text, or viewing a map of a selected geographical location), which can then be invoked with the selected object. According to Microsoft, Accelerators eliminate the need to <b>copy</b> <b>and</b> <b>paste</b> content between web pages. IE8 specifies an XML-based encoding which allows a web application or web service to be invoked as an Accelerator service. How the service will be invoked and for what categories of content it will show up are specified in the XML file. Similarities have been drawn between Accelerators and the controversial Smart tags feature experimented with in the IE 6 Beta but withdrawn after criticism (though later included in MS Office).|$|E
25|$|A month {{into his}} term as premier, an article {{published}} in Nature reported that an anonymous source had charged Ponta with plagiarizing over half his doctoral thesis, claims that were later reiterated by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Ponta admitted that the referencing system used by his thesis did not provide clear attribution of its sources, but rejected the allegations of plagiarism. Dumitru Diaconu, a law professor and author supposedly plagiarised by Ponta's thesis, and who also authored a foreword for the published edition of the thesis, declared he was not aware of plagiarism and did not intend to pursue the accusations. A session of a committee charged with validating academic titles analyzed the thesis and decided with a unanimous vote of members present that Ponta had committed <b>copy</b> <b>and</b> <b>paste</b> plagiarism, subsequently requesting the withdrawal of Ponta's doctoral title. In response, interim Education Minister Liviu Pop (PSD) contested the committee's jurisdiction and dismissed the findings, citing the lack of a quorum. The minister had already signed an order reorganizing the committee the previous day, but, due to technical reasons, the order came into effect during the very session analyzing the thesis.|$|E
500|$|The level design {{received}} mixed comments. Mueller called {{some of them}} [...] "extremely frustrating". Helgeson {{stated that}} the fast-paced [...] "levels are poorly designed", and Andrew Reiner, who wrote a second-opinion review for Game Informer, called the level design [...] "disastrous". Official Xbox Magazine was more mixed, balancing the possibility of getting lost in the large levels with the likely appeal of these stages to 3D Sonic gamers, particularly those who had enjoyed Sonic Heroes. GameTrailers found that [...] "the levels are either dark and urban, or bright and psychedelic. Either way, they fit in well to the Sonic universe. They are loaded with speed ramps, loops {{and an assortment of}} other boosts that rocket Shadow like a pinball." [...] Bettenhausen included [...] "the classic run-like-hell roller coaster design philosophy" [...] of some stages in his limited praise. Casamassina deplored the [...] "stupid level design", adding that [...] "Just because they dazzled players six years ago does not mean that Sonic Team can <b>copy</b> <b>and</b> <b>paste</b> exactly the same loops and spins into each new franchise iteration and expect everyone to be happy with the outcome." [...] GameSpy observed that [...] "the areas are much less open than in previous Sonic games, but the level designers haven't taken advantage of the constraints." [...] Nintendo Power singled out the difficulty of the missions that require the player to locate objects.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{criticism}} about {{the length and}} readability of IBAN. Printed on paper the IBAN {{is often difficult to}} read. Therefore, it is popular to group the IBAN with four symbols. However, for electronic documents (e.g. PDF invoice) the <b>copy</b> <b>and</b> <b>paste</b> of grouped IBAN can result in errors with online banking forms.

In addition, the Character Map utility included with MS Windows {{can be used to}} <b>copy</b> <b>and</b> <b>paste</b> en and em dash characters into most applications.|$|E
2500|$|Mac OS X Snow Leopard {{includes}} QuickTime X. QuickTime Player X lacks cut, <b>copy</b> <b>and</b> <b>paste</b> {{and will}} only export to four formats, but its limited export feature is free. Users {{do not have}} an option to upgrade to a Pro version of QuickTime X, but those who have already purchased QuickTime 7 Pro and are upgrading to Snow Leopard from a previous version of Mac OS X will have QuickTime 7 stored in the Utilities or user defined folder. Otherwise, users will have to install QuickTime 7 from the [...] "Optional Installs" [...] directory of the Snow Leopard DVD after installing the OS.|$|E
2500|$|In Microsoft Word {{running on}} a {{computer}} whose keyboard has a numeric keypad, an em dash can be typed with [...] (on the numeric keypad, with the numeric hyphen usually in the top-right corner), and an en dash can be typed with [...] This does not work with the hyphen key on the main keyboard (between [...] "0" [...] and [...] "=" [...] with a US or UK layout), which has completely different functions. With Microsoft Word's default settings, in both Windows and Macintosh versions, an em dash symbol, which {{is not always a}} true em dash from the font, is automatically produced by Autocorrect when two unspaced hyphens are entered between words (as in [...] "word--word"). An en dash, which again, is not always a true en dash from the font, is automatically produced when one or two hyphens surrounded by spaces are entered: ("word - word") or ("word -- word"). This feature can be disabled by customizing Autocorrect. Other dashes, spaces, and special characters are possible, found through the Tools menu. Unassigned symbols, such as the true minus sign, can be assigned keyboard shortcuts through the Insert menu. To determine if the true en or em dash from the font are being used rather than a cross-referenced character from the Symbol font, <b>copy</b> <b>and</b> <b>paste</b> samples of the dashes into a text editor such as Windows Notepad. Using the true dash is important if one ever needs to share documents with other users in other applications or operating systems.|$|E

40|$|Now {{digital images}} {{are widely used}} in many fields. Making image forgeries with digital media editing tools is very easy, and t hese image forgeries are {{undetectable}} by human eyes. Copy-move forgery is common image tampering where {{a part of the}} image is <b>copied</b> <b>and</b> <b>pasted</b> on another parts. Up to now the useful way to detect copy-move forgeries is block matching technique. This paper firstly analyzes and summarizes block matching technique, then introduces a copy-move forgery detecting method based on local invariant feature matching. It locates <b>copied</b> <b>and</b> <b>pasted</b> regions by matching feature points. It detects feature points and extracts local feature using Scale Invariant Transform algorithm. Matching local features is based on k-d tree and Best-Bin-First method. Through analysis we learn computational complexity of the proposed method is similar to existing block-matching methods, but has better locating accuracy. Experiments show that this method can detect <b>copied</b> <b>and</b> <b>pasted</b> regions successively, even when these regions are operated by some process, such as JPEG compression, Gaussian blurring, rotation and scale. </p...|$|R
