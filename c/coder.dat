5|$|The Murray <b>cod</b> (Maccullochella peelii) {{is a large}} Australian predatory {{freshwater}} fish of the Maccullochella genus and the Percichthyidae family.

50|$|Trout <b>cod</b> reach sexual {{maturity}} at 3 to 5 years (which corresponds to about 35 cm in males and 43 cm in females). Trout <b>cod</b> reach {{sexual maturity}} at a smaller size than Murray <b>cod,</b> {{which is an}} adaptation to the rocky, low nutrient and often quite small upland habitats trout <b>cod</b> were found in. Spawning of trout <b>cod</b> has never been observed in the wild and is not well understood. It {{is believed to be}} essentially the same as Murray <b>cod</b> but occurs about three weeks earlier and at significantly lower temperatures in waters shared by the two species. Trout <b>cod</b> are believed to spawn at temperatures as low as 15 degrees in upland rivers, using rocks as a spawning substrate; these are also clear adaptations to cool, rocky upland river habitats. Significantly, and unlike Murray <b>cod,</b> trout <b>cod</b> will not breed in earthen dam brood ponds; another indication that trout <b>cod</b> are a more specialised upland species than Murray <b>cod.</b> Artificial breeding programs being conducted for the species recovery use hormone injections to induce ovulation in naturally ripe fish in spring. Trout <b>cod</b> will hybridise with Murray <b>cod</b> and so for recovery projects it is important that Murray <b>cod</b> are not stocked into sites where Trout <b>Cod</b> and Murray <b>cod</b> are not already coexisting sympatrically.|$|R

25|$|Multiplexes {{can make}} use of {{statistical}} multiplexing at the MPEG video <b>coder</b> whereby the bitrate allocated to a channel within the multiplex can vary dynamically depending on {{how difficult it is}} to code the picture content at that precise time, and how much demand there is for bandwidth from other channels. In this way, complex pictures with much detail may demand a higher bitrate at one instant and this can result in the bitrate allocated to another channel in the same multiplex being reduced if the second channel is currently transmitting pictures which are easier to encode, with less fine detail.|$|E

The work of Raymond Troplong provided the material for 50 articles related to the testament inheritance, and others for the real rights.

40|$|Polymorphisms at five {{microsatellite}} DNA loci {{provide evidence}} that Atlantic <b>cod</b> Gadus morhua inhabiting Gilbert Bay, Labrador are genetically distinguishable from offshore <b>cod</b> on the north-east Newfoundland shelf and from inshore <b>cod</b> in Trinity Bay, Newfoundland. Antifreeze activity in the blood suggests that Gilbert Bay <b>cod</b> overwinter within the Bay. Gilbert Bay <b>cod</b> are also smaller (weight and length) for their age and consequently less fecund for their age, than <b>cod</b> elsewhere within the northern <b>cod</b> complex. The productivity and recruitment potential of coastal <b>cod</b> off Labrador may thus be much {{lower than that of}} offshore northern <b>cod</b> or of inshore <b>cod</b> farther south, implying that a more conservative management strategy may be required for <b>cod</b> from coastal Labrador than traditionally practised for northern <b>cod</b> inhabiting less harsh environments. Relatively high FST and RST measures of population structure suggest that important barriers to gene flow exist among five components that include two inshore (Gilbert and Trinity Bay) and three offshore <b>cod</b> aggregations on the north-east Newfoundland Shelf and the Grand Bank. DA and DSW estimates of genetic distance that involve Gilbert Bay <b>cod</b> are approximately three- and 10 -fold larger, respectively, than estimates not involving Gilbert Bay <b>cod.</b> The differences between inshore <b>cod</b> from Gilbert Bay and Trinity Bay raise the possibility that other genetically distinguishable coastal populations may exist, or may have existed prior to the northern <b>cod</b> fishery collapse. Harvesting strategies for northern <b>cod</b> should recognize the existence of genetic diversity between inshore and offshore components as well as among coastal components...|$|R

25|$|Fundamentally, WMA is a {{transform}} <b>coder</b> {{based on}} modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT), somewhat similar to AAC, Cook and Vorbis. The bit stream of WMA {{is composed of}} superframes, each containing 1 or more frames of 2048 samples. If the bit reservoir is not used, a frame is equal to a superframe. Each frame contains a number of blocks, which are 128, 256, 512, 1024, or 2048 samples long after being transformed into the frequency domain via the MDCT. In the frequency domain, masking for the transformed samples is determined, and then used to requantize the samples. Finally, the floating point samples are decomposed into coefficient and exponent parts and independently huffman coded. Stereo information is typically mid/side coded. At low bit rates, line spectral pairs (typically less than 17kbit/s) and a form of noise coding (typically less than 33kbit/s) {{can also be used}} to improve quality.|$|E
25|$|The related {{concept of}} {{maternal}} mind-mindedness assesses the mother's {{ability to understand}} and verbalize the infant's mind: thoughts, desires, intentions and memories. Maternal mind-mindedness {{has been found to}} be related to some developmental results, such as attachment security. A caregiver's comment is deemed an appropriate mind-related comment if the comment was deemed to match the infant's behaviour by the independent <b>coder,</b> if the comment associated the infant's current activity to past activities, and/or if the comment encouraged the infant to go on with his or her intentions when the conversation paused. This correlates to high maternal mind-mindedness. If the caregiver assigns the wrong internal state to the baby's behaviour, if the comment about the current activity is not insufficiently associated with a past event, if the comment deters the infant from proceeding with the current activity, and/or if the comment is unclear, it is deemed a in-appropriate mind-related comment and correlates to low mind-mindedness.|$|E
25|$|Tuberous organs, {{the type}} of {{receptive}} organ used for electrocommunication, {{can be divided into}} two types, depending on the way information is encoded: time coders and amplitude coders. There are multiple forms of tuberous organs in each time and amplitude coders, and all weakly electric fish species possess at least one form of the two coders. Time <b>coder</b> fires phase-locked action potential (meaning, the waveform of the action potential is always the same) at a fixed delay time after each outside transient is formed. Therefore, time coders neglect information about waveform and amplitude but focus on frequency of the signal and fire action potentials on a 1:1 basis to the outside transient. Amplitude coders, on the contrary, fire according to the EOD amplitude. While both wave-type and pulse-type fishes have amplitude coders, they fire in different ways: Receptors of wave-type fishes continuously fire at a rate according to their own EOD amplitude; on the other hand, receptors of pulse-type fishes fire burst of spikes to each EOD detected, and the number of spikes in each burst is correlated to the amplitude of the EOD. Tuberous electroreceptors show a V-shaped threshold tuning curve (similar to auditory system), which means that they are tuned to a particular frequency. This particular tuned-in frequency is usually closely matched to their own EOD frequency.|$|E
