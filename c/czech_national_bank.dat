He later studied in Masaryk University's management program, and received his MPA from Nottingham Trent University's executive program in 2010. After college, he worked as a UNIX programmer, business school teacher, and portfolio manager at an investment company. Michálek was a broker at the National Property Fund from 1994 to 1996, when he was fired after exposing a tunneling embezzlement scheme. The resulting court case found that he was improperly dismissed. He was later involved in compensating victims of financial crime. Michálek served as a capital market supervisor at the Czech Ministry of Finance from 1997 to 1998, a director at the Czech Securities Commission from 1998 to 2006, a director at the <b>Czech</b> <b>National</b> <b>Bank</b> from 2006 to 2007, a senior consultant at the World Bank in 2007, and the chief financial market inspector at the <b>Czech</b> <b>National</b> <b>Bank</b> from 2008 to 2010.|$|E

In March 2015, the ruling Czech Social Democratic Party decided at its annual congress to adopt the policy of striving hard to gather political support for the state to adopt the euro by 2020, as one of their four top priorities. In April 2015, the coalition government announced it had agreed not to set a euro adoption target and not to enter ERM-2 before after the next legislative election scheduled for 2017, making it unlikely that the Czech Republic will adopt the euro before 2020. In addition, the coalition government agreed that if it wins re-election it would set a deadline of 2020 to agree on a specific euro adoption roadmap.|$|E

Inflation in the Czech Republic has fallen substantially since peaking {{in the double}} digits in 1998.

The effect on overall output is also strongly positive, almost 2 % for growth in 2015, but only marginally statistically significant, which might be connected to disturbances created by changes in excise taxes. The effect of the commitment on inflation is positive but not statistically significant at standard levels. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R

The factors in question are changes in the structural characteristics of economies in transition, changing perception of inflation risks, the inconsistency of central bank's monetary decisions and central bank's weakened credibility and uncertainty about the efficient transmission of monetary measures. The empirical analysis documents non-stationary variability of ultra short-term PRIBOR interest rates and stability of longer maturity PRIBOR interest rates. These results reflect the role of CNB in bank system liquidity management, the uncertainty about the timing of CNB's monetary policy at the changing speed of the appreciation of the crown, tendencies of overestimation of expected inflation and changing structural characteristics. monetary policy, GARCH, interest rates, variability...|$|R

The same list of explanatory variables employed by the <b>Czech</b> <b>National</b> <b>Bank's</b> banking sector regulators, corresponding to the inputs of the CAMELS rating, are examined for both ratings to select their significant predictors. We employ an ordered-response logit model to analyze the long-run S&P rating and a standard panel data framework for the CAMELS rating.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the issue of}} central bank losses, developing a framework for assessing {{the ability of a}} central bank to keep its balance sheet sustainable without having to default on its policy objectives. Compared to the earlier literature, it analyses in more depth the consequences of economic convergence for the evolution of the central bank’s balance sheet and the important role played in this process by the risk premium and equilibrium real exchange rate appreciation. A combination of a closed-form comparative-static analysis and numerical solutions of the future evolution of the central bank’s own capital is used. Applying the framework to the <b>Czech</b> <b>National</b> <b>Bank’s</b> case, the paper concludes that the CNB should be able to repay its accumulated loss in about 15 years without any transfer from public budgets.

40|$|We {{incorporate}} a housing market with liquidity-constrained households into the <b>Czech</b> <b>National</b> <b>Bank’s</b> core forecasting model (g 3) {{to analyze the}} relationship between housing market and aggregate fluctuations in a small open economy framework. We discuss the historical shock decomposition of house prices and interpret the results {{in the light of}} recent empirical work. For a wide range of model calibrations, the interaction between the housing market and the aggregate economy is weak and so the monetary policy implications of house price fluctuations for the Czech Republic are not strong. We interpret this – in line with recent empirical evidence – as an indication that the wealth effects stemming from house ownership are not significant in the Czech Republic. Nevertheless, we show that the collateral mechanism significantly improves the forecasting properties of the extended model, especially for private consumption. This indicates the importance of the collateral effect, which can be caused by assets other than houses...|$|R
