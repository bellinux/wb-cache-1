40|$|At {{some sites}} both <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> {{radiological}} investigation {{of soil and}} groundwater is required for overall site characterization. While the planning and execution of investigation activities is usually completed to fulfill regulatory (i. e., United States Environmental Protection Agency or United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission) requirements, coordination of <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> radiological investigation programs may {{provide an opportunity for}} reducing the duration of investigation activities and reducing overall project costs. There are several similarities in the <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> radiological investigation processes that one can take advantage of in program design and execution to efficiently plan <b>and</b> execute <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> radiological investigations simultaneously. At sites where both <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> radiological constituents are being investigated in soil and groundwater, various steps can be taken during the investigation processes to combine <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> radiological investigation and characterization activities. With proper planning, investigating <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> radiological constituents simultaneously in soil and groundwater can reduce the project schedule and provide cost savings for overall characterization of the site...|$|R

In addition, the introduction of piggyback flatcars, in which truck trailers are transported long distances on specially-designed cars, has allowed railroads to regain some of the business lost to trucking.|$|E
