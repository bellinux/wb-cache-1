5000|$|Already {{categorized}} as gay or lesbian, many gay bars in larger cities/urban areas take this sub-categorization {{a step further}} by appealing to distinct subcultures within the gay community.

Other subcultures <b>cater</b> <b>to</b> men who fit a certain type, one that is often defined by age, body type, personality, and musical preference.

5|$|Chamberlain {{attended}} Rugby School. Unhappy {{during his}} school years, {{he made no}} lasting friendships there. Although he did reasonably well in his classes, he was not outstanding academically or athletically, and his father withdrew him from the school four months short of his eighteenth birthday. In later years, as Chamberlain rose to the heights of British politics, he seldom visited the school, did not enrol his own son, and rarely spoke of his time there. Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to Mason College (which later developed into the University of Birmingham), which both emphasised the politician's connection to Birmingham and <b>catered</b> <b>to</b> the interest in science which Neville had shown at Rugby. Neville Chamberlain studied metallurgy and engineering for two years, but {{had little interest in}} the subjects. In 1889 his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants. Within six months, he became a salaried employee.|$|E

Jaojoby agreed to this provision, studying during the day and performing at night for several years. In 1972 he began singing with Los Matadores, the well-established house band of the Saigonais nightclub in Diego-Suarez. This group <b>catered</b> <b>to</b> the club's primarily Western clientele by performing cover songs and rhythm and blues compositions in French and English, occasionally incorporating traditional instruments like kabosy and drums, or experimenting with local musical styles using electric guitar, bass, and drum kit, accompanied by traditional Malagasy language vocal performance.|$|E

5|$|Pirate radio {{met with}} {{increasing}} opposition, {{especially from the}} authorities {{in the form of}} the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) Radio Regulatory Division (and later the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) after it became responsible for radio regulation) which had claimed since the late 1960s that pirate radio caused interference to licensed broadcasters and could interfere with frequencies used by emergency services. Nonetheless the growth of pirate radio in the 1980s was so rapid that at one point pirate radio operators outnumbered legal broadcasters. Pirate stations such as Radio Invicta, JFM, and London Weekend Radio continued to gain popularity and increasingly operated openly. Pirate radio targeted music communities ignored by mainstream broadcasting, such as reggae, hip hop, jazz, indie rock, indie pop and rhythm and blues. Stations like London Greek Radio, which broadcast to the Greek and Greek Cypriot community, also <b>catered</b> <b>to</b> ethnic minorities.|$|E
5|$|Most early St. Louisans {{remained}} illiterate {{through the}} 1810s, although many wealthy merchants purchased books for private libraries. Early schools in St. Louis were all fee-based and mostly conducted lessons in French. The first substantial educational effort came about {{under the authority}} of the Catholic Church, which in 1818 opened Saint Louis Academy, later renamed Saint Louis University. In 1832, the college applied for a state charter, and in December 1832, it became the first chartered university west of the Mississippi River. Its medical school opened in 1842, with faculty that included Daniel Brainard (founder of Rush Medical College), Moses Linton (founder of the first medical journal west of the Mississippi River in 1843), and Charles Alexander Pope (later president of the American Medical Association). However, the university primarily <b>catered</b> <b>to</b> seminary students rather than the general public, and only in the 1840s did the Catholic Church offer large scale instruction at parochial schools. In 1853, William Greenleaf Eliot founded a second university in the city – Washington University in St. Louis. During the 1850s Eliot founded Smith Academy for boys and Mary Institute for girls, which later merged and became Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School.|$|E
5|$|The Half Day area {{experienced}} an economic boom {{with the arrival}} of new settlers during the two decades after Wright's arrival. Among these pioneers were Seth Washburn, the first postmaster of the Vernon Township, who settled at the site of what later became the Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103's Half Day Intermediate School, and Laura Sprague, the first teacher to reside in the area. By 1855, 21years after the settling of the Half Day area by Wright, the town was a thriving community with a blacksmith's shop, sawmill, country store, and a church. At this time, the Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad connected Milwaukee to the county seat of Waukegan, and it expanded throughout the Lake County area over the next few decades; this also contributed to the town's prosperity. Henry Ford's invention of the automobile in the early 20thcentury made Half Day a more accessible destination to other communities within the Chicago metropolitan area, and the village became a popular recreation area. This prompted the opening of many businesses, including an amusement park, a race track, a bowling alley, a dance hall, and taverns, that <b>catered</b> <b>to</b> visitors.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the European population before industrialization lived in rural communities or isolated farms and households. The norm was self-sufficiency with {{only a small percentage}} of production being exported or sold in markets. Large towns were exceptions and required their surrounding hinterlands to support them with food and fuel. The dense urban population could support a wide variety of food establishments that <b>catered</b> <b>to</b> various social groups. Many of the poor city dwellers had to live in cramped conditions without access to a kitchen or even a hearth, and many did not own the equipment for basic cooking. Food from vendors was in such cases the only option. Cookshops could either sell ready-made hot food, an early form of fast food, or offer cooking services while the customers supplied some or all of the ingredients. Travellers, such as pilgrims en route to a holy site, made use of professional cooks to avoid having to carry their provisions with them. For the more affluent, there were many types of specialist that could supply various foods and condiments: cheesemongers, pie bakers, saucers, waferers, etc. Well-off citizens who had the means to cook at home could on special occasions hire professionals when their own kitchen or staff could not handle the burden of throwing a major banquet.|$|E
5|$|West {{points out}} that Kaifeng shopkeepers rarely had time to eat at home, so they chose {{to go out and}} eat at a variety of places such as restaurants, temples, and food stalls. Restaurant {{businesses}} thrived on this new clientele, while restaurants that <b>catered</b> <b>to</b> regional cooking targeted customers such as merchants and officials who came from regions of China where cuisine styles and flavors were drastically different than those commonly served in the capital. The pleasure district mentioned above—where stunts, games, theatrical stage performances, taverns and singing girl houses were located—was teeming with food stalls where business could be had virtually all night. West makes a direct connection between the success of the theatre industry and the food industry in the cities. Of the fifty some theatres within the pleasure districts of Kaifeng, four of these could entertain audiences of several thousand each, drawing huge crowds which would then give nearby businesses an enormous potential customer base. Besides food, traders in eagles and hawks, precious paintings, as well as shops selling bolts of silk and cloth, jewelry of pearls, jade, rhinoceros horn, gold and silver, hair ornaments, combs, caps, scarves, and aromatic incense thrived in the marketplaces.|$|E
5|$|Wilkinson was {{a member}} of the {{freshman}} basketball team at Liberty High School. Using profits from his early business ventures, he purchased a business wardrobe that earned him the title of best dressed member of his senior class. He graduated from high school in 1959, but the poor curriculum there left him without the credits he needed to gain admission to the University of Kentucky's engineering program. He began selling livestock feed in Scottsville, Kentucky, and also worked at a venetian blind factory while taking classes at Campbellsville College to earn the credits he needed. In 1962, he moved to Lexington, Kentucky, and enrolled at the University of Kentucky. While in college, he worked at Kennedy Book Store in Lexington. Later, he and two friends borrowed money to open the Kentucky Paperback Gallery in Lexington; Wilkinson left school later that year to attend to the business full-time. At the time, Kentucky high school students were required to purchase their own textbooks, but there was no marketplace for buying and selling used books; Wilkinson's business <b>catered</b> <b>to</b> this market and was highly successful.|$|E
