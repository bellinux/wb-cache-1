40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} non-ideal clamping shapes on the dynamic behavior of silicon nanocantilevers. We fabricated silicon nanocantilevers using silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers by employing stepper ultraviolet (UV) lithography, which permits a resolution of under 100 nm. The nanocantilevers were driven by electrostatic force inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Both lateral and out-of-plane resonance frequencies were visually detected with the SEM. Next, we discuss overhanging of the cantilever support and curvature at the <b>clamping</b> <b>point</b> in the silicon nanocantilevers, which generally arises in the fabrication process. We found that the fundamental out-of-plane frequency of a realistically clamped cantilever is always lower than that for a perfectly clamped cantilever, and depends on the cantilever width and the geometry of the <b>clamping</b> <b>point</b> structure. Using simulation with the finite-elements method, we demonstrate that this discrepancy is attributed to the particular geometry of the <b>clamping</b> <b>point</b> (non-zero joining curvatures and a flexible overhanging) that is obtained in the fabrication process. The influence of the material orthotropy is also investigated and is shown to be negligible...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCarbon fiber {{reinforced}} composites (CFRP) {{are mostly}} manufactured near net shape. Nevertheless, a final milling step {{at the edges}} of the cured components is still necessary. Damages which occur during milling or drilling of CFRP lower the durability of the components and increase the production costs. Requirements concerning the clamping system for milling or drilling CFRP are rising simultaneously with increasing complexity of the components. This stresses the need for complex clamping systems like linear clamping jaws around the whole workpiece. However such types of clamping systems induce poor accessibility to the component being worked on and hence longer machining time. As a result to the need for complex clamping systems, the production costs are increased. Therefore, several benefits can be achieved by increasing the distances between the <b>clamping</b> <b>points</b> of the <b>clamping</b> system to reduce machining time and production costs. This paper discusses investigations of milling tests with variable clamping conditions of the workpieces. In the experiments a linear milling operation the edge of the workpiece is examined. The clamping of the planar specimens was realized with a clamping system which enables the adjustment of different distances between the <b>clamping</b> <b>points</b> of the specimen. The process forces and the resulting damage at the workpiece surfaces were measured during the experiments. These results are compared with a linear clamping system to examine the influence of rising clamping distances. The results demonstrate that the distance of the <b>clamping</b> <b>points</b> while milling the edge of the workpiece has a significant influence on the process forces...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the bi-Laplacian eigenvalue {{problem for the}} modes of vibration of a thin elastic plate with a discrete set of <b>clamped</b> <b>points.</b> A high-order boundary integral equation method is developed for efficient numerical determination of these modes {{in the presence of}} multiple localized defects {{for a wide range of}} two-dimensional geometries. The defects result in eigenfunctions with a weak singularity that is resolved by decomposing the solution as a superposition of Green's functions plus a smooth regular part. This method is applied to a variety of regular and irregular domains and two key phenomena are observed. First, careful placement of <b>clamping</b> <b>points</b> can entirely eliminate particular eigenvalues and suggests a strategy for manipulating the vibrational characteristics of rigid bodies so that undesirable frequencies are removed. Second, clamping of the plate can result in partitioning of the domain so that vibrational modes are largely confined to certain spatial regions. This numerical method gives a precision tool for tuning the vibrational characteristics of thin elastic plates. Comment: 21 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

40|$|Harness 3 D routing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{challenging}} steps in the design of aircraft Electrical Wiring Interconnection System (EWIS), due to the intrinsic complexity of the EWIS, the increasing number of applying design constraints, and its dependency on the design changes of the airframe and installed systems. The current routing process employed by EWIS design is largely based on the manual work of expert engineers, partially supported by conventional CAD systems. As a result, the routing process is quite inefficient, error prone and unable to deliver optimal solutions. Although many harness components are selected from catalogues and the design process is largely repetitive and rule based, it has been found that none or very limited automation solutions, which can significantly decrease the workload of engineers and increase their efficiency, are currently available. In this research, an innovative approach is proposed to solve the 3 D routing automation as an optimization problem. Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) and optimization methods are proposed to achieve the minimum cost routing solutions that satisfy all relevant design rules and constraints. The basic idea is to achieve the optimal EWIS routing solutions by optimizing the position of the harnesses <b>clamping</b> <b>points,</b> which are used as way-points to route the harnesses inside the aircraft digital mock-up. The challenge to solve this optimization problem is that the number and initial value of design variables, namely the number and position of <b>clamping</b> <b>points,</b> are not known a priori. In order to handle this challenge, a two-step, hybrid optimization strategy has been devised. The first step, called Initialization, uses a road map based path finding method to generate a preliminary harness definition, including the required number and preliminary position of its <b>clamping</b> <b>points.</b> The second step, called Refinement, uses a conventional optimization method to move the position of the clamps and refine the preliminary harness definition aiming for the minimum cost and the satisfaction of all the design constraints. This approach has been implemented into a KBE application and tested on several routing cases. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of handling cases of representative geometric complexity and design constraints and delivering proper 3 D harness models in full automation. <br/...|$|R
