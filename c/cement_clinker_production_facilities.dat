40|$|To devise {{low-carbon}} <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> product, in-depth {{knowledge about}} the variation mechanism of <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions is the prerequisite. The determinants of <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions in Chinese cement industry have been inquired by several researches recently. However, the impacts and abatement effect of <b>clinker</b> quality on <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions have not been identified yet. In technological sense, there lacks an integrated quantitative model that can elucidate the dynamic mechanism between <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions and clinker quality. To fill this gap, this paper devises a CO 2 emission accounting framework integrated with optimization model to explore the dynamic mechanism between <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions and clinker quality. Based on survey data of 2 typical <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> <b>production</b> lines in China, the accounting framework is validated with measured data. Through numerical simulation within this framework, a set of sensitivity analysis is conducted. The results indicate that if the target KH (lime saturation ratio) of both production lines climb from - 5 % to + 5 %, the process CO 2 emission factor will give rise to an increase of about 16. 4 and 14. 8 kg CO 2 /t clinker, respectively. With the same variation, the fuel CO 2 emission factors of two production lines will gain 17. 2 and 13. 7 kg CO 2 /t clinker, respectively. Obviously, controlled decrease of clinker quality can reduce CO 2 emission of clinker manufacturing. The results of sensitivity analysis are robust and highlight the remarkable role of clinker quality in both process and fuel emissions. Besides, the integrated framework can provide in-depth investigation into the dynamic mechanism between CO 2 emissions and the other determinants. Using this framework, cement plants or industry can develop optimal clinker quality standards on a quantitative basis to achieve low-carbon clinker. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the thesis}} is to {{evaluate}} if developed phase chemical process models for <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> and lime <b>production</b> processes are reliable to use as predictive tools in understanding the changes when introducing sustainability measures. The thesis describes the development of process simulation models {{in the application of}} sustainability measures as well as the evaluation of these models. The motivation for developing these types of models arises from the need to predict the chemical and the process changes in the production process, the impact on the product quality and the emissions from the flue gas. The main chemical reactions involving the major elements (calcium, silicon, aluminium and iron) are relatively well known. As for the minor elements, such as sodium and potassium metals, sulphur, chlorine, phosphorus and other trace elements, their influence on the main reactions and the formation of clinker minerals is not entirely known. When the concentrations of minor and trace elements increase due to the use of alternative materials and fuels, a model that can accurately predict their chemistry is invaluable. For example, the shift towards using less carbon intensive fuels and more biomass fuels often leads to an increased phosphorus concentration in the products. One way to commit to sustainable development methods in <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> and lime <b>production</b> is to use new combustion technologies, which increase the ability to capture carbon dioxide.

Our results show that the inclusion or the exclusion of undesirable factors (CO 2) influence efficiency levels as well as the investments in new technologies and the utilization of alternative fuels and raw materials in the <b>cement</b> and <b>clinker</b> <b>production</b> processes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cement</b> <b>clinker</b> <b>production</b> is {{a highly}} {{resource}} and energy intensive process and contributes substantially to annual global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. One potential pathway to reduce the environmental footprint of cement-based materials is through the reduction of clinker content in concrete by partial replacement of cement with fillers. In this investigation, the partial replacement of cement with chemically inert nano and microsized fillers of titanium dioxide (TiO₂) and limestone was examined. The effects of nano and micro fillers on early-age properties, long-term properties, photocatalytic properties (for TiO₂-cement mixtures) and life cycle costs were measured and compared. Investigation of early-age properties shows that nanoparticles increase rate and degree of early cement hydration and chemical shrinkage due to heterogeneous nucleation effect. In contrast, coarser microparticles (> 3 µm in this research) maintain or marginally decrease the rate and degree of early cement hydration and decrease chemical shrinkage due to a dilution effect. In addition, temperature sensitivity of hydration reactions increases {{in the presence of}} nanoparticles. Investigation of long-term properties shows that pore size refinement is possible with the partial replacement of cement with nanoparticle fillers. But the long-term tests of filler-cement mixes also demonstrate that, compared to ordinary portland cement mix, the strength decreases and permeability increases. Analysis of photocatalytic properties of TiO₂-cement mixtures showed a lack of an appropriate testing procedure for nitrogen oxide (NOₓ) gas conversion by cement-based materials. Thus, a new standardized procedure and photocatalytic efficiency factor for characterizing photocatalytic NOₓ binding by cementitious materials is proposed. Life cycle analysis demonstrates that although inclusion of TiO₂ increases initial environmental impact of cementitious materials, the innovative photocatalytic properties of TiO₂ could improve sustainability. Life cycle analysis also shows that partial replacement of cement with limestone decreases environmental impact of cementitious mixtures due to lower processing “costs” of limestone compared to cement. Thus, the results from the current research demonstrate that variation of dosage and particle size of inert fillers can be used to tailor properties and structure of cement-based materials and that environmental sustainability can be improved by partial replacement of cement with inert fillers that introduce additional functionalities or fillers with lower embodied-energy and emissions.

40|$|Cement {{manufacture}} {{accounts for}} 3 - 5 {{percent of total}} global carbon emissions. There is a growing interest in reducing the environmental impact and conserve limited natural resources. In <b>cement</b> <b>production,</b> <b>clinker</b> <b>productions</b> consume 87. 5 {{percent of the total}} energy consumed in the cement manufacture. Cementa has since many years, focused on reducing the environmental impact of cement production. The work has involved the entire production process from selection of alternative fuels to the development of <b>cement</b> with less <b>clinker</b> content. During 2013 / 2014, two new types of cement (Bascement and CEM II / B) will be introduced to the Swedish market. Cementa is also working to reduce cement use in concrete and this thesis is a part in this work. By developing better concrete proportioning tool based on {{a better understanding of the}} influence of the concrete constituents on the fresh concrete properties, cement consumption is reduced. The following report deals with new types of <b>cement</b> with less <b>clinker</b> content, where the clinker partially is replaced by fly ash, slag and limestone. As a reference, the study takes today's construction cement from Slite and Skövde. The study aims to find out how today´s construction cement and the new cement types differ in their rheological properties. Experiments have been conducted on mortar and concrete with different plasticizers and air-entraining agents. The study also addresses air-entrainment demand and open time of fresh concrete with new cement types. The results show that the new cement types, Bascement and CEM II/B, have better rheological properties than their references Slite and Skövde cement. Regarding the demand for air-entraining agent’s, Bascement show significantly greater demand than Slite cement, while the difference in air-entraining demand between Slite cement, Skövde cement and CEM II / B is very small. Furthermore, the results show that concrete with Bascement constitutes larger 28 -day strength than the concrete with Slite cement, while the concrete strength with CEM II/B is similar to its reference cement Skövde. Since the strength development properties are dealt with in previous studies, these test series are limited to 28 -days strength testing only...|$|R
40|$|Ladle {{metallurgy}} (LM) slag {{is generated}} during the refining process step in stainless steel making. In {{view of its}} very fine particle size, due to the transformation of b- to g-C 2 S, and the Cr content, the slag is challenging in terms of handling and disposal and is used in only few applications. The current work explores the utilisation of the LM's fine fraction in Ordinary Portland <b>Cement</b> (OPC) <b>clinker</b> <b>production.</b> Three sets of samples containing LM slag, in 0 wt% (OPC e reference), 6 wt% (OPC 6) and 14 wt% (OPC 14), were investigated. The sintering temperature was 1450 C with 40 min soaking time. The clinkers containing LM slag, showed {{a slight increase in}} C 3 S and a decrease in C 3 A and C 4 AF. The formation of the C 3 S initiated at a lower temperature probably due to the presence of F and C 2 S. Longer setting times were found for OPC 6 and OPC 14. The compressive strength results were found to be comparable at 2 d (22 e 25 MPa), 7 d (36 e 38 MPa) and 28 d (44 MPa) of curing, falling into 42. 5 R CEM I category. The emission of kgCO 2 /t of <b>clinker</b> during <b>production,</b> is estimated to decrease at least 12 % for OPC 14. A processing step for the pre-treatment of the slag is also presented, aiming to reduce the initial Cr content. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Mercury {{transformation}} {{mechanisms and}} speciation profiles are reviewed for mercury formed in and released from flue gases of coal-fired boilers, non-ferrous metal smelters, cement plants, {{iron and steel}} plants, municipal solid waste incinerators, and biomass burning. Mercury in coal, ores and other raw materials is released to flue gases {{in the form of}} Hg 0 during combustion or smelting in boilers, kilns or furnaces. Decreasing temperature from over 800 °C to below 300 °C in flue gases leaving boilers, kilns or furnaces promotes homogeneous and heterogeneous oxidation of gaseous elemental mercury (Hg 0) to gaseous divalent mercury (Hg 2 +), with a portion of Hg 2 + adsorbed onto fly ash to form particulate-bound mercury (Hg p). Halogen is the primary oxidizer for Hg 0 in flue gases, and active components (e. g.,TiO 2, Fe 2 O 3, etc.) on fly ash promote heterogeneous oxidation and adsorption processes. In addition to mercury removal, mercury transformation also occurs when passing through air pollution control devices (APCDs), affecting the mercury speciation in flue gases. In coal-fired power plants, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system promotes mercury oxidation by 34 – 85 %, electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and fabric filter (FF) remove over 99 % of Hg p, and wet flue gas desulfurization system (WFGD) captures 60 – 95 % of Hg 2 +. In non-ferrous metal smelters, most Hg 0 is converted to Hg 2 + and removed in acid plants (APs). For <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> <b>production,</b> mercury cycling and operational conditions promote heterogeneous mercury oxidation and adsorption. The mercury speciation profiles in flue gases emitted to the atmosphere are determined by transformation mechanisms and mercury removal efficiencies by various APCDs. For all the sectors reviewed in this study, Hg p accounts for less than 5 % in flue gases. In China, mercury emission has a higher fraction (66 – 82 % of total mercury) in flue gases from coal combustion, in contrast to a greater Hg 2 + fraction (29 – 90 %) from non-ferrous metal smelting, cement and iron/steel production. The higher Hg 2 + fractions shown here than previous estimates may imply stronger local environmental impacts than previously thought, caused by mercury emissions in East Asia. Future research should focus on determining mercury speciation in flue gases from iron and steel plants, waste incineration and biomass burning, and on elucidating the mechanisms of mercury oxidation and adsorption in flue gases...|$|R

40|$|The world {{production}} of cement has greatly {{increased in the}} past 10 years. This trend {{is the most significant}} factor affecting technological development and the updating of manufacturing facilities in the cement industry. Existing technology for the <b>production</b> of <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> is ecologically damaging; it consumes much energy and natural resources and also emits pollutants. A new approach to the {{production of}} blended or high-volume mineral additive (HVMA) cement helps to improve its ecological compatibility. HVMA cement technology is based on the intergrinding of portland <b>cement</b> <b>clinker,</b> gypsum, mineral additives, and a special complex admixture.

This improvement leads to a reduction of energy consumption per unit of the cement produced. Higher strength, better durability, reduction of pollution at the <b>clinker</b> <b>production</b> stage, and decrease of landfill area occupied by industrial by-products, all provide ecological advantages for HVMA cement...|$|R
