40|$|A {{challenging}} {{open question}} regards the combined use of low cost GPS systems together with low <b>cost</b> <b>Inertia</b> navigation systems in vehicle navigation tools. Apart from {{the principle of}} working, The two systems are characterized by di erent features. The rst provides (when suitably operating) optimal precision for long distance and observation time, the second one is very e cient only within a short observation time as being a ected by the so called random walking e ect. In many recent papers the NN {{have been used to}} increase the accuracy of the Inertia Measurement Systems together with GPS signals. However, the direct use of the cinematic variables in the network provided results whose reliability are restricted to limited classes of events (or trip). A more interesting approach is the possibility to use Neural Network system to try to increase the reliability of the inertia measurements while being able to foresee the origin of sensor mistakes. In this paper attention is focused on the capability to get a successful training of a neural network. As a matter of fact, the optimal choice of the input parameters of a NN is fundamental to achieve a general training, that is to say not focused on a particular set of observations. The more these parameters are directly connected to the physical source of errors, the more the network will be capable of a general (not specialised) use...|$|E
40|$|In several {{industrial}} case studies, we put {{in evidence}} that microsystem manufacturing costs skyrocket because of low yields. Sometimes product functionalities are badly defined; sometimes metrology systems, {{in spite of their}} high cost, happen not to measure the desired functions of the assembly; at other times process off-centerings (mean distance to target) measured on batches required systematic adjustment, or else targets are not {{in the middle of the}} tolerances range. Resulting products present lack of profitability. Often, quality engineers first reaction is to fight process variability. We have shown that this is not the right policy in precision engineering. The first step is to verify that measurements are reliable, then insure the relevance of the functional requirements and after that, control the process off-centerings. It is then time to search ways to reduce variability. We provide engineers with a set of questions to analyse problems, so that product cost and profitability are considered from the beginning. For the low yields seen in precision assembly, we formulate how to calculate the ratio of conforming assemblies whatever part probability density functions might be. Low yields are due to three main sources : functional interval, off-centering and variability. Measurement variability is a fourth one, not negligible, often included in, and mixed up with process variability. A first cure for low-yields is illustrated by an example where measurement variability and tight tolerances are overturned by functional tolerancing and measurement. In precision engineering, where tolerance intervals are specified in the range of some microns, off-centering effects greatly influence assembly yields. Inertial tolerancing allows designers to assure that assemblies are produced at expected <b>cost.</b> <b>Inertia</b> is a joint specification including both process variability and off-centering. If high costs are due to process variabilities, selective assembly (sorting and mating parts) may be a cost-effective option. Moreover, it affords to reach very small variabilities, unreachable with existing manufacturing machines, or to avoid heavy investment in new equipment. Few make the most of this method, which is more practiced than confessed. Our state of the art, the most important to our knowledge, has pointed out the lack of cost perspective on this subject, on which some work is presented. Through an in-depth study of submillimetric press-fit, different techniques to reduce variability are illustrated. It all starts with a clear definition of press-fit functional requirements, before trying to optimize its design. Parameters of the Lamé-Clapeyron model are identified to be the relevant ones to design press-fits. Among them, interference is the most sensitive and critical one in press-fit, because submillimetric holes are hard to produce precisely. Knowing the functional requirements and the main sources of variability affords the optimization of assembly robustness, to desensitize it to dimensional variations. Electroforming is a manufacturing technique that opens up new opportunities for creative design by adapting the contact surface between hub and shaft. To sum things up, we have shown the great influence of quality control in precision engineering, proposed the best ways to achieve it, including the use of novel microelectronic manufacturing processes...|$|E

30|$|As {{can be seen}} in the table, the {{influencing}} factors in the external context were all relevant both for a better understanding of and for comparing the creation, diffusion, and sustaining of the two categories of innovations. In addition, a traditional market was nonexistent in both cases so interpersonal diffusion channels were highly relevant. Decisions about how to develop the organizational innovation were mainly based on top management’s or board members’ experience and beliefs. Both cases also affect several subsystems within the organization. However, GIS is more tacit and less standardized; thus, several factors in the internal context—such as search and learning processes, transfer and implementation <b>costs,</b> <b>inertia,</b> and <b>costs</b> for sustaining the innovation—may presumably be negatively affected, while a wider dissemination of GIS to other companies and organizations could be limited.

According to our DSGE model, it {{is responsible for}} 92 percent of the smoothing in the investment response to aggregate shocks, and it introduces important nonlinearities and history dependance in business cycles and policy sensitivity.

40|$|PurposeThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to go beyond {{satisfaction}} as an indicator of customer loyalty and propose a holistic model of service switching in a mobile internet setting. The model, which reflects both barriers and inducements of switching, is developed based on the “mooring” and “pull” concepts in the migration literature. Design/methodology/approachFocusing on Generation Y mobile internet subscribers, the study analyzed a total of 417 usable questionnaire responses. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to test the research model. FindingsThe results show that first, satisfaction and switching barriers (i. e. a focal firm’s marketing innovation initiatives, switching <b>costs,</b> <b>inertia,</b> and local network effects) are positively related to customer loyalty; second, switching barriers have a stronger influence on customer loyalty compared with satisfaction; third, switching inducements (i. e. competitors’ marketing innovation initiatives, alternative attractiveness, variety-seeking tendencies, and consumers’ susceptibility to social reference group influence) is negatively related to customer loyalty and the relationship is weaker when perceived switching barriers are high. Originality/valueThis study empirically validates multidimensional scales of switching barriers and inducements from a more nuanced perspective, and specifies them as reflective-formative type II models. This study is among the first to use opposing dimensions to measure switching barriers and its counterpart. Hence, it illustrates how the two contrasting mechanisms can coexist in the minds of mobile internet subscribers...|$|R

40|$|Brand {{loyalty is}} tightly {{connected}} with competition for market share between brands, as it describes consumers' willingness to maintain compatibility between subsequent purchases. Imposed by exogenous or endogenous factors, {{the reasons for}} brand loyalty can be summarized in the switching cost. However, consumers {{do not live in}} isolation, instead they influence and get influenced by peers. Especially if influence propagates via "word-of-mouth" and not direct marketing, peer pressure becomes invaluable as consumers reach for compatibility with other consumers. The evolution of market share competition can be described by coordination games played in networks over multiple periods. Consumers, acting as the players of the coordination game, contemplate the quality of the available choices while being susceptible at others' influence. By considering switching <b>costs,</b> <b>inertia</b> in their actions is also introduced. An important issue therefore arises - if the available choices are qualitatively similar, how do the switching costs in combination with network effects affect the competition outcome? In this thesis, we address this issue by introducing switching costs into the standard coordination game; the switching cost game thus describes potential losses inflicted on players by changing - switching - strategies. We particularly concentrate our efforts on the proportions of strategies at equilibrium. Compared to the cost-free game, the switching costs are responsible for the emergence of a coexistence region where all available strategies coexist in equilibrium. Numerical results on various network structures verified the coexistence outcome, along with the effect of cost values and their symmetry on the determination of the coexistence limits. Next, we investigate the monotonicity of the competition evolution. We exploit the monotonous behaviour of the switching cost game limiting cases over time to draw an analogy with bootstrap percolation and benefit from existing analytical methods to calculate their final outcome and create bounds of the general case. We also show how these bounds depend on the switching costs. Finally, we examine the effects of switching costs on the critical behaviour of the system by studying the properties of stable clusters.

NNS {{models were}} quickly adopted as a {{framework}} for the evaluation of monetary policy, and a large literature ensued. Lucas (2003) has, however, claimed that macroeconomic stabilization is no longer an important concern in the United States. In this paper, we calculate the welfare <b>cost</b> of nominal <b>inertia</b> in an NNS model with wage and price stickiness, capital formation, and empirically estimated rules for government spending and the cental bank’s interest rate policy.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze a dynamic game of Cournot {{competition}} with heterogeneous firms choosing between two different adaptive behavioral rules in deciding output strategies. The underlying oligopoly structure is standard: using a constant {{return to scale}} technology, N firms produce homogeneous goods, which are sold in a market characterized by constant price elasticity. In this setup, we assume that a fraction of firms employs a quite rough rule of thumb, the so-called Local Monopolistic Approximation (LMA), whereas the complementary fraction plays Best Reply (BR), a more demanding strategy in terms of information and computation requirements. The model is first considered with exogenously fixed fractions of firms in the two complementary groups. Then it is generalized by considering an endogenous evolutionary switching process between the two behavioral strategies based on profit-driven replicator dynamics. The role {{of the number of}} firms, information <b>costs</b> and <b>inertia</b> (or anchoring attitude) in production decisions is analyzed, as well as the influence in the evolutionary process of random noise in the demand function and memory of past profits.

The "attractive" mixed-strategy equilibrium of Hawk-Dove games represents a far better candidate for long-run equilibrium than its unstable counterpart in coordination games, and yet robust selection results have proved elusive, with conditions on the selection dynamics generally being required. Such a condition remains a necessity in the switching cost model with state-independent mutations. However, a more realistic model of state-dependent mutations driven by stochastic switching costs overcomes this problem, and identifies a threshold mean switching cost, above which the mixed-strategy equilibrium is selected {{in the long run}} for a wide class of switching cost distributions. ...|$|R

The shape of European production models is interrelated to the specifics of European national institutional systems following the general assumption that company strategies and practices are shaped by a set of institutional conditions in which these company activities are embedded.

In this paper, a low cost high-side power supply for the gate driver of switched reluctance machine is presented. With the use of a bootstrap technology, the high-side circuit acquires energy from the power supply of the low-side when the high-side switch is turned off. The acquired energy is utilized to support the high-side gate driver and current sensor when the phase winding is excited with the DC-link voltage. The circuit requires only a power diode and capacitor for each high-side power electronic switch. Comparing with traditional isolated power supply solutions, the cost and size of the proposed method are reduced. The necessary control algorithm of the gate drive to sustain the high-side voltage is also presented in this paper. Although it slightly increases the computational burden of the controller, it imposes no limit on the control of the phase winding of the machine with proper selection of the bootstrap capacitor. The guideline on the selection of the power electronic components is derived based on the parameters of the switched reluctance machine.

Diesels pro-rate their fuel usage {{to the length of}} trains, which a steam engine cannot do. Multiple-unit diesel power is scalable to power requirements with one locomotive crew; steam power is not. A high speed Hudson steam locomotive is good for only one situation, high speeds on level grades. The diesel locomotive can be operated by a single person, with no need of a fireman to shovel coal (two person cab crews may be required for other reasons). Also, diesels use much less fuel and no manpower when idling, something locomotives often do. Diesels can be parked running for days unattended, whereas steam engines must be constantly tended to if not completely shut down. Bringing a steam engine boiler up to operating temperature is often regarded as both an art and science, requiring much training and experience. A Diesel starts and shuts down just like an automobile.|$|R
40|$|In {{transition}} countries, {{especially in}} the period of central planning or semi-command regulation, prices of goods and services in the non-tradable sector were regulated, {{which was one of the}} main obstacles to normal functioning of the supply-demand market mechanism after the breakdown of the socialist economic system. In the period of economic transition reestablishment of market institutions arises, with price deregulation as one of the fundamental constitutional parts of this process. But in the case of transition economies there exists a recognized doubt in an immediately well functioning market system after deregulation because of inadequate development of the economic system in the past that produced a gap in the development of institutions typical for market economies. The aim of this article is to present the results of the empirical analysis on the market outcomes of price deregulation for chimney sweep services in the Slovenian economy. For this purpose we developed an original model for analysing market outcomes after price deregulation occurs. For the selected case study we recognize large cumulative price growth, that was a consequence of significant supply-side imperfection, since the selection among suppliers is based on the concession system at the municipality level. transition, technical efficiency, technical coefficient, Slovenia, non-tradable sector, market competitiveness, Inflation <b>inertia,</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the extent to which inertia is {{distinct}} from calculative commitment and to extend the knowledge on these constructs in the corporate financial services context in Australia. The study proposes and empirically analyses a research model that considers switching costs as an antecedent to inertia and calculative commitment. Design/methodology/approach – An e-mail URL-embedded web questionnaire was used to collect data online from responding organisations. The psychometric properties of the measures were analysed using confirmatory factor analysis, and the hypothesised relationships among the latent constructs were estimated using structural equation modelling. Findings – The variance-extracted test established discriminant validity between inertia and calculative commitment. Switching <b>costs</b> affected both <b>inertia</b> and calculative commitment differently. Research limitations/implications – The measurement scales should be subjected to further assessment before drawing conclusions on their construct validity. The findings support the contention that inertia occurs from high search and learning costs associated with transaction account products, and that calculative commitment is caused by the existence of sunk costs. Practical implications – Managers should be cautious in employing barriers as mechanisms for customer retention, because calculatively committed customers might be behaviourally loyal only for as long as it is instrumentally rewarding to be so. However, dissatisfied customers often can become involved in inert buying patterns. Originality/value – This paper is an important initial step in highlighting the extent to which inertia is distinct from calculative commitment, in addition to providing a measure of inertia...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by the rising interest in assessing the effect of disruptions in resources and environmental conditions on economic growth. Such an assessment requires, ultimately, the use of truly integrated models of the climate and economic systems. For these purposes, we have developed a Non-Equilibrium Dynamic Model (NEDyM) by introducing investment dynamics and nonequilibrium effects into a Solow growth model. NEDyM can reproduce various economic regimes, such as manager- or shareholder-driven economies, and permits one {{to examine the effects}} of disruptions on the economy, given either an assumption of steady-state growth or an assumption of business cycles with transient disequilibrium. We have applied NEDyM to an idealized economy that resembles in certain respects the 15 -state European Union in 2001. The key parameter in NEDyM is investment flexibility. For certain values of this parameter, the model reproduces classical business cycles with realistic characteristics; in particular, NEDyM captures the cycles' asymmetry, with a longer growth phase and more rapid contraction. The cyclical behavior is due to the investment­ profit instability and is constrained by the increase in labor <b>costs</b> and the <b>inertia</b> of production capacity. For somewhat greater investment flexibility, the model exhibits chaotic behavior, because a new constraint intervenes, namely limited investment capacity. The preliminary results presented here show that complex behavior in the economic system may be due entirely, or at least largely, to deterministic, intrinsic factors, even if the economic long-term equilibrium is neo-classical in nature. In the chaotic regime, moreover, slight shocks ­ such as those due to natural or man-made catastrophes ­ may lead to significant changes in the economic system...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Service {{research}} typically relates {{switching costs}} to customer loyalty, and portrays them as effective switching deterrents that engender harmful word-of-mouth (WOM). Rather than to customer loyalty, this paper aims to relate switching <b>costs</b> to consumer <b>inertia,</b> {{and show that}} while switching costs may result in customer retention, they can engender positive and negative WOM. This depends on whether the inertia stems from satisfaction or indifference. Design/methodology/approach: A mall-intercept survey investigated 518 customers' perceptions of their mobile phone service providers. Structural equation modelling fitted the data to the conceptual model. Findings: Switching costs deterred switching and engendered negative WOM, but only with low-inertia customers. With high-inertia customers, retention and WOM behaviours depended on whether the inertia stemmed from satisfaction or indifference. Satisfied customers with high switching costs tended to stay, gave more positive and less negative WOM. With indifferent customers, switching costs were unrelated to retention or WOM behaviours. Research limitations/implications: While they may be perceived negatively, switching costs can engender PWOM. Hence, research should not consider switching costs alone without considering the context that produces them. Practical implications: Service providers should segment their customers into low-inertia, high-inertia/satisfied and high-inertia/indifferent, and target each segment differently. By converting customers into the high-inertia/satisfied segment, service providers can make {{the best use of}} switching costs – not only in the traditional sense as a barrier to defection, but also as a way of generating positive WOM. Originality/value: This study is the first to consider the role of <b>inertia</b> with switching <b>costs,</b> positive WOM, and negative WOM. The findings suggest that past studies portraying switching costs as negative impediments that evoke only negative WOM might be misleading. ...|$|R
