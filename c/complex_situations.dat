5|$|More {{sympathetic}} authors {{point out}} <b>complex</b> <b>situations</b> that Rommel had to face. Brian Hanley, from USNI's Editorial Board of Directors, comments that Rommel was beaten {{the moment he}} arrived in Africa, considering the Allied troops outnumbered the Afrika Korps and they worked under a much more straightforward chain of command, while orders sent from Berlin to North Africa were rarely kept confidential. Hanley sees Rommel turning German and Italian military authorities against each other as turning liabilities into advantages and that he repeatedly created operational miracles that made a strategic investment in the Africa theatre attractive in 1942. Also, according to Hanley, if Rommel stood still, his enemy's strength would accumulate while his own, depending on an uncertain supply line, would diminish, thus he needed the British stocks of supply {{to deal with his}} logistical problems.|$|E

25|$|In more <b>complex</b> <b>situations,</b> {{the main}} ebb and flood flows do not dominate. Instead, the flow {{direction}} and magnitude trace an ellipse over a tidal cycle (on a polar plot) instead of along {{the ebb and}} flood lines. In this case, analysis might proceed along pairs of directions, with the primary and secondary directions at right angles. An alternative is to treat the tidal flows as complex numbers, as each value has both a magnitude and a direction.|$|E

There are several techniques, tools, and strategies used to improve communication. Any team should have a clear purpose and each member {{should be aware of}} their role and be involved accordingly. To increase the quality of {{communication between}} people involved, regular feedback should be provided. Strategies such as briefings allow the team to be set on their purpose and ensure that members not only share the goal but also the process they will follow to achieve it. Briefings reduce interruptions, prevent delays and build stronger relationships, resulting in a strong patient safety environment.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, a study {{proposed}} that immediate human ancestors and wolves may have domesticated {{each other through}} a strategic alliance that would change both respectively into humans and dogs. The effects of human psychology, hunting practices, territoriality and social behavior would have been profound. Wolves and dogs mark their territory with scent; however, humans {{do not have a}} keen sense of smell and may have begun to mark their territories with symbols, which became the first art and may have been generative of human culture. Wolves hunt large game; however, {{there is no evidence of}} pre-sapiens hunting large game. Early humans moved from scavenging and small-game hunting to big-game hunting by living in larger, socially more-complex groups, learning to hunt in packs, and developing powers of cooperation and negotiation in <b>complex</b> <b>situations.</b> As these are characteristics of wolves, dogs and humans, it can be argued that these behaviors were enhanced once wolves and humans began to cohabit. Communal hunting led to communal defense. Wolves actively patrol and defend their scent-marked territory, and perhaps humans had their sense of territoriality enhanced by living with wolves. One of the keys to recent human survival has been the forming of partnerships. Strong bonds exist between same-sex wolves, dogs and humans and these bonds are stronger than exist between other same-sex animal pairs. Today, the most widespread form of inter-species bonding occurs between humans and dogs. The concept of friendship has ancient origins but it may have been enhanced through the inter-species relationship to give a survival advantage.|$|E

500|$|The playwright Tom Stoppard {{approached}} Hordern in 1971 {{with a view}} to {{him playing}} a leading part in the playwright's new play Jumpers, a comic satire based around the field of academic philosophy. [...] Hordern was to play George Moore, a bumbling old philosophy professor, who is employed at a modern university and who, throughout the play, is in constant debate with himself over his moral values. Hordern, though thinking the play was brilliant, disliked the script on the initial read-through as he did not understand its <b>complex</b> <b>situations</b> and strange dialogue. His co-star would be Diana Rigg, who played Moore's wife Dotty, and the entire piece was to be directed by Peter Wood.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As the <b>complex</b> <b>situation</b> of {{electromagnetic}} environment {{is difficult to}} be analyzed and simulated visibly, interface program is developed based on the calculation module of Wireless Insite 2. 5 software. Equipments such as communication, radar, electronics resists and other radio devices are studied to build accurate theoretic models. Moreover, a method for creating software receivers quickly in MATLAB is proposed and other equipment models are created automatically just based on the parameters of equipments in the same way. Then, situations of time, frequency and energy-domain are calculated successfully with using Wireless Insite 2. 5. <b>Complex</b> 2 -D <b>situation</b> {{of electromagnetic}} environment is displayed in the 2 -D map by using MATLAB map display technology.
