Second, origin taxation distorts consumption, and makes consumers in low-tax countries better off and consumers in high-tax countries worse off.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{transfer}} pricing {{has become one}} of the most important issues for tax authorities and companies. As the area has become more complex this has lead to an increase in disputes and a need for dispute resolution procedure. Advanced Pricing Arrangement (APA) is the latest dispute resolution procedure and was introduced in Sweden in 2010. APAs determine a taxpayer’s future taxation of <b>cross-border</b> <b>transaction</b> by a taxpayer. Through co-operation the taxpayer and the tax authorities reach an APA that aims to avoid double taxation. The legislation is based on the guidance from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and it serves as a framework for many domestic legislations. Other countries with more experience from APAs have implemented additional guidance from the OECD in its legislation but the Swedish legislation has left some options outside. The Swedish APA does not allow for unilateral APAs where an agreement is concluded only with one tax authority in a <b>cross-border</b> <b>transaction.</b> In Sweden, only APAs negotiated with other tax authority are allowed. To increase legal certainty where unilateral APAs are the best or only way Sweden should implement them it its legislation. As the APA process is costly and complex small and medium companies cannot benefit from the advantages. In order for smaller companies to be able to take advantage of the APA program a simplified system should be implemented. In some countries the tax administrations also allows the APA to be applicable retrospective, referred to as roll-back. Through a roll-back taxpayers can avoid potential disputes regarding past transactions as well as the advantages from the APA for future transactions. This can be done while a taxpayer is under audit and is considered a less hostile alternative...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} recognition that significant welfare gains could be realized through deep forms of regional integration which entail harmonization of legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks. Reforms that reduce <b>cross-border</b> <b>transaction</b> costs and improve the performance of “backbone” infrastructure services are arguably even more important for the creation of an open, unified regional economic space than trade policy reforms narrowly defined. This paper assesses the potential gains from regionalized telecommunications policy in West Africa. To this end, the paper: (i) discusses how regional cooperation can overcome national limits in technical expertise, enhance the capacity of nations credibly to commit to stable regulatory policy, and ultimately facilitate infrastructure investment in the region; (ii) identifies trade-distorting regulations that inhibit opportunities for regional trade and economic development, and so are good candidates for regional trade negotiations to reduce indirect trade barriers; and (iii) describes substantive elements of a harmonized regional regulatory policy that can deliver immediate performance benefits.

40|$|The East African Community {{has long}} {{recognised}} that {{regional economic integration}} can yield sig-nificant welfare gains to its member states. To that end, the community has been making steady progress towards the removal of tariffs and quantitative restrictions to trade. Moreover, in recent years, {{there has been an}} increasing recognition that (a) even greater welfare gains could be realised through deeper forms of regional integration which entail harmonisation of legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks; and (b) reforms that reduce <b>cross-border</b> <b>transaction</b> costs and improve the performance of ‘backbone ’ infrastructure services are arguably even more important for the creation of an open, unified regional economic space than trade policy reforms narrowly defined. Disparities of regulatory treatment across borders can introduce distortions that hinder both cross-border trade and the aggregate flows of investment on a regional basis. Regulatory harmonisation and infrastructure regionalisation could make a significant contribution to the region’s economic development by promoting a more efficient utilisation of its human and physical resources, enhanc-ing connectivity, reducing the costs of trade and facilitating the integration of the continent with the global economy...|$|E
40|$|Competition {{policy is}} a field where economists and lawyers have to work hand in hand to achieve {{efficiency}} and, in the international arena, global welfare. At the present, there is no internationally recognised official authority {{under the auspices of}} which there would take shape the global competition policy and, simultaneously, set up a core of global competition rules. Competition policy, still national or supranational in its nature, is, as a consequence, under strong influence of other national or supranational policies and so regulated by various laws that in their specific way address competition cases including those with an international element. Overlapping of jurisdictions, conflicts between substantive and procedural laws are unavoidable. Considering that full and simultaneous compliance with all those laws is a hard task to fulfil, it makes <b>cross-border</b> <b>transaction</b> much more risky, time consuming, and costly than is necessary. By setting up an autonomous international court for global competition cases not only would we get rid obstacles to efficient enforcement of competition but we could make global welfare flourish without depriving developing countries of their economic growth. global competition, global market, international court, enforcement, World Trade Organization...|$|E

40|$|A {{well-established}} fact {{in international}} economics is that relative {{prices at the}} retail level across countries, expressed in a common currency, comove closely with the nominal exchange rate. Understanding why is central to answering some of the classic questions in international economics, ranging from the gains from market integra-tion to the transmission of shocks across borders. Two ingredients are necessary to generate this pattern in the data. First, some economic forces must cause retail prices to differ across countries. Standard explanations {{emphasize the importance of}} local nontraded retailing costs or pricing to market at the retail level (Ariel Burstein, Martin Eichenbaum, and Sergio Rebelo 2005; Pinelopi K. Goldberg and Frank Verboven 2005). Second, <b>cross-border</b> <b>transaction</b> costs must be large enough to prevent arbi-trage. Indeed, a large body of literature interprets the price gap of similar goods across borders as a measure of these transaction costs (Charles Engel and John Rogers 1996). In this paper, we bring new data and a new approach to these questions. We use weekly data at the barcode level on retail prices and wholesale costs for 250 US stores (in 19 states) and 75 Canadian stores (in 5 provinces) of a single retail chain between January 2004 and June 2007 on over 4, 000 products.

40|$|We test if {{financial}} integration improves household consumption smoothing using microeconomic data. We {{find that the}} process of financial market integration and liberalisation brought about by the introduction of the euro has not affected the sensitivity of consumption with respect to income shocks in Italy. This article also makes a significant contribution from a methodological point of view, because our procedure does not require that consumption and income are available in the same panel data set. It can therefore be applied in all countries in which repeated cross-sectional con-sumption data can be combined with panel data on income. The European Monetary Union (EMU) has removed exchange rate risk and lowered <b>cross-border</b> <b>transaction</b> costs, opening the possibility {{for the creation of a}} fully inte-grated continental financial market comparable with that of the US. To what extent has this process of regulatory reform affected the ability of households to diversify, insure and shoulder risks? This article attempts to answer this question, which is at the heart of the burgeoning literature on the links between regulation, finance and real economic activity. To answer the question, we study the effect of the euro policy shift with Italian household-level income and consumption data spanning two decades (1987 – 2006) ...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{agri-food}} {{chains are}} more global {{than ever and}} are characterized by increased imports and exports and global sourcing of products, resulting in increased <b>cross-border</b> <b>transaction</b> risks. The objective {{of this paper is}} to identify the typical risks regarding agri-food supply chains involved in cross-border transactions and to assess their importance as perceived by agri-food managers. The analysis takes into consideration four different agrifood value chains (meat, grain, olive oil, fresh vegetables and fruits). Following an explorative approach and a qualitative technique, a series of face to face in-depth interviews was conducted. Results indicate that risk perception may be quite different across countries, value chains, tiers of the supply chain, as well as across respondents. The prevalence of Market dynamics risks was pointed out in most of the interviews, yielding the impression that many operators identify the market as the most difficult environment. Differences in risk perception between fresh produce (fruit/vegetables and meat) and processed food chains (grain and olive oil) are probably interrelated to the different degree of integration within these supply chains, the different level of standardization achieved and the different causes of risks that are inherent to the nature of the product.

40|$|Direct {{investment}} is {{the category of}} international investment that reflects the objective of an entity resident in one economy obtaining a lasting interest in an enterprise resident in another economy.

40|$|Using a {{panel of}} {{corporate}} transactions in 27 EU countries from 1999 to 2012, we investigate {{the impact of the}} financial crisis on the market for corporate assets. In particular, we test the ‘fire-sale FDI’ hypothesis by analyzing the number of <b>cross-border</b> <b>transactions,</b> the price of corporate assets and the impact of credit and macroeconomic conditions. According to the fire-sale FDI hypothesis, countries affected by a crisis attract foreign buyers selling assets at a discount. We find a dampening effect of the crisis on <b>cross-border</b> <b>transactions</b> in all EU countries. Although countries with higher sovereign default risk and lower economic demand attracted more foreign buyers in the crisis, lower domestic credit is associated with less <b>cross-border</b> <b>transactions.</b> Corporate assets in crisis countries are cheaper, particularly if domestic credit is low; however, these findings are not limited to the crisis period. This pattern is strikingly different from the East Asian and Latin American financial crises.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to assess the {{potential}} benefits from trade facilitation in terms of increased trade flows both on average and specifically for the six regional groupings of ACP countries negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with the EU.

A gravity model on two-way bilateral trade between 22 EU countries and 106 developing countries is estimated using a sample selection approach. We find that time delays both {{on the part of the}} exporter and the importer on average significantly decrease trade flows. We also find that this relationship is not linear: an extra day of waiting has smaller marginal effects if the time requirements are already high. On average, lowering border delays in the exporting country with one day from the sample mean would yield an export increasing effect of about 1 percent, while the same reduction in the importing country would give an import increase of about 0. 5 percent. More specifically, we also find that countries negotiating in the EPA groups for SADC, West Africa, Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA), and th...|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} some of {{the private}} international law perspectives on electronic commerce, namely the matters of jurisdiction and choice of law. Electronic commerce {{is based on the}} formation of contracts, and when there are contracts, questions regarding legal issues arise. A distinctive trait of electronic business is that its activities are not bound by geographic borders in a traditional sense; cross border-contracts can be entered into as easy as can “domestic” contracts. This <b>cross-border</b> <b>transaction</b> adds another element to the legal questioning involved – which court will be competent to entertain a claim that sources from an electronic contract and which country’s law will be applicable? These questions are of course not new; as long as there have been nations there have been cross-border contracts and questions of jurisdiction and choice of law have, consequently, been dealt with for many years.
