Milk solids account for 8-14% of the yogurt's volume, providing lactose for sweetness and proteins for smoothness and increased resistance to melting. <b>Cane</b> <b>or</b> <b>beet</b> <b>sugar</b> provides 15-17% of the yogurt's ingredients. In addition to adding sweetness, the sugar increases the volume of solid ingredients in the yogurt, improving body and texture. Animal gelatin and/or vegetable additives (guar gum, carrageenan, etc.) stabilize the yogurt, reducing crystallization and increasing the temperature at which the yogurt will melt. This stabilization ensures that the frozen yogurt maintains a smooth consistency regardless of handling or temperature change.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} feeding bees {{artificial}} sugars and/or proteins on the sugar compositions and (13) C isotopic measurements of royal jellies (RJs) were evaluated. The sugars fed to the bees were two C 4 sugars (cane sugar and maize hydrolysate), two C 3 sugars (sugar beet, cereal starch hydrolysate), and honey. The proteins fed to them were pollen, soybean, and yeast powder proteins. To evaluate {{the influence of}} the sugar and/or protein feeding over time, samples were collected during six consecutive harvests. (13) C isotopic ratio measurements of natural RJs gave values of around - 25 ‰, which were also seen for RJs obtained when the bees were fed honey or C 3 sugars. However, the RJs obtained when the bees were fed cane sugar or corn hydrolysate (regardless of whether they were also fed proteins) gave values of up to - 17 ‰. Sugar content analysis revealed that the composition of maltose, maltotriose, sucrose, and erlose varied significantly over time in accordance with the composition of the syrup fed to the bees. When corn and cereal starch hydrolysates were fed to the bees, the maltose and maltotriose contents of the RJs increased up to 5. 0 and 1. 3 %, respectively, compared to the levels seen in authentic samples (i. e., samples obtained when the bees were fed natural food: honey and pollen) that were inferior to 0. 2 % and not detected, respectively. The sucrose and erlose contents of natural RJs were around 0. 2 %, whereas those in RJs obtained when the bees were fed <b>cane</b> <b>or</b> <b>beet</b> <b>sugar</b> were as much as 4. 0 and 1. 3 %, respectively.

40|$|The yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is still}} the prime species used in ethanol production. Traditionally, ethanol has been {{produced}} from raw materials such as <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> <b>or</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> and starch from corn or other grains. Future expansion of ethanol production are planed its use as a biofuel requiring the utilization new non- food resources, particularly lignocelluloses. In {{the present and future}} ethanol production process, the expenditure for the raw material is a significant cost factor. Although industrial yeast strains are very efficient in producing ethanol, the current ethanol yield (90 - 93 % of the theoretical maximum) could in principle be further improved. Particularly, the synthesis of glycerol, a major by-product of alcoholic fermentation, has been regarded as a wasteful process. The overall goal of this project was to develop novel industrial yeast strains, which are able to produce more ethanol from the traditional and future raw materials by reducing the yield of the undesirable by-product glycerol. The challenge herein is that glycerol serves different important physiological functions such as redox balancing and osmotic stress tolerance. In this project, two alternative avenues were used to identify a genetic configuration for a low glycerol producer strain. The first approach was a rational engineering strategy aiming to finely tune the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of glycerol synthesis, the glycerol 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase. The basic idea here was to gradually reduce the expression of the corresponding genes, GPD 1 and GPD 2, by replacing their native promoters through mutated low strength TEF 1 promoter versions. After the promoter exchange, the mutants were characterized for their residual glycerol formation, fermentation and growth. In the second approach, the genetic configuration of wild-type yeast with low glycerol yields were analyzed. Its genetic determinants, which cause the low glycerol phenotype were identified, using an advanced genetic mapping methodology base on next-generation pooled segregants whole-genome sequence analysis. The four genes, GPD 1 SSK 1 SMP 1 and HOT 1 were identified, which harbored mutations linked to the 'low glycerol' phenotype. The SSK 1 allele of the superior low producing glycerol strain, ssk 1 E 330 N [...] . K 356 N was subsequently used as novel gene tool for targeted genetic improvement of the ethanol yield of a frequently used ethanol production strain with minimal risk of affecting its other industrially important traits. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{depletion}} of fossil fuels and the increase of greenhouse gas emissions, solutions are needed to replace petrol based products. As a consequence, the number of biobased products developed using agricultural feedstock is continuously increasing. This study focuses on the carbon footprint of bio-HDPE produced either from Brazilian <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> <b>or</b> Belgian <b>sugar</b> <b>beet.</b> The goal {{of this study is}} to compare the carbon footprint of bio-HDPE with the fossil one, taking into account the effect of land use change. Common boundaries of the agricultural systems comprise the cultivation step for both crops, i. e. sugar cane and <b>sugar</b> <b>beet,</b> with all associated energy and fertilizer consumptions, the transportation step from field to the industrial plant, the sugar crops transformation into hydrate bioethanol, the by-products valorisation, the dehydration and polymerization steps and the HDPE incineration as end of life issue. Fossil scenario includes the production of ethylene, its polymerization and its incineration. When comparing the entire life cycle of bio and fossil HDPE, the GHG emissions are lower for the biobased product which is the willing effect. This result is only valid if no Land Use Change (LUC) or Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) effect appears. To assess the environmental impact of the deforestation or of the transformation of a pasture into a field, the EC-Guidelines from the European Union were used in order to calculate the CO 2 emissions depending on several parameters. For sugar cane, LUC consists in the transformation of pastures into fields in the region of Sao Paulo in Brazil. Three scenarios can be developed based on different agricultural practices for pasture and field (tillage and fertilizers inputs) : the best, the worst and the average. The best case leads to a supplementary environmental gain. The worst and average achieve additional emissions. A payback time, considering the time needed to find again an environmental gain compared to the fossil counterpart, was calculated for the average scenario which is equal to 12 years. The ILUC effect for sugar cane is assumed to be deforestation due to the transformation of forest into pasture induced by the previous LUC effect. The rate of deforestation can vary between 16 % or 100 % depending on used statistics and leads to a payback time of respectively 26 and 101 years. For <b>sugar</b> <b>beet,</b> no LUC is considered. Indeed, no land expansion is available in Belgium due to small available areas. In the case of an increase of bioplastics production, Belgium should import <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> from neighboring countries which can induce ILUC. In this study, <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> is assumed to be provided by the Netherlands on pastures previously transformed into fields. The average scenario implies a payback time of 8 years. This study permits to highlight the importance of LUC and ILUC especially for energetic crops dedicated to replace fossil products.

40|$|Abstract In {{commercial}} {{ethanol production}} producers often use sugarcane <b>or</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> molasses {{as raw material}} due to their abundance and low costs.
