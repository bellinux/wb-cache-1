5000|$|Back in the 1950s, the Australian {{cleaning}} product market lacked any aerosol-based products, hence {{the development of}} Mr Sheen by Samuel Taylor Pty Ltd {{was the first of}} such a product to be offered in the Australian market. The popularity of Mr Sheen received a large boost when the advertising agency Hansen Rubensohn developed both a jingle and a character for the product in the late 1950s. The Australian character (supposedly modeled on one of Samuel Taylor Pty Ltd's employees at the time) was created by Vic Nicholson and Brian Henderson as a smiling, rosy-cheeked, short bald man with spectacles in a black suit; a jingle was created at the same time by Bob Gibson and Jimmy White. Both the character and jingle have proved effective branding agents in Australia, where 95% of the populace capable of recognising the character and jingle as belonging to the Mr Sheen product range. In 1969, British multinational consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser (then called Reckitt & Colman) acquired Samuel Taylor Pty Ltd; the new owners expanded the range of the product out to the United Kingdom and South Africa. The British version of the character is a cartoon caricature of a First World War biplane pilot (originally voiced by Willie Rushton in the television advertisements) who flies around the house on a dusting cloth <b>cleaning</b> <b>tables,</b> banisters and television sets, using the slogan [...] "Mr Sheen shines umpteen things clean".|$|R

Recent successful approaches employ machine learning algorithms to identify points on the scene that the robot should grasp. In this paper, we show that the task can be significantly simplified by using segmentation, especially with depth information.

We also propose a shape completion and grasp planner method which takes partial 3 D information and plans the most stable grasping strategy.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{generate}} informed design recommendations for Geriatric Psychiatry Units in hospitals in order to create and facilitate a dementia friendly built environment with accessible inclusive wayfinding systems. In establishing a set of design guidelines to achieve this outcome, three sources of knowledge and practice were drawn together: preliminary observations; interviews with the staff of the GPU unit at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute; and a meta-ethnography study. The results show that simple design modifications with properly designed floor layout may have a significant impact on residents’ behavioural outcomes; such as using landmarks, cues, colour schemes, and dementia-friendly signage system. The guidelines of the research indicate and argued that wayfinding systems have to be designed and based on the particular environmental responses of the residents, making these systems more readily accessible and inclusive for the diversity of resident population including their abilities and background. Of particular importance, is that research points to the need and potential for designing environments with home-based social activities in mind; like laundry folding, <b>cleaning</b> dishes, green <b>table</b> to play cards, and old fashioned office desks, etc. Recommendations established to address these needs are relatively low-cost for GPU units, and may be extendable to other built environments outside of hospital settings...|$|R
50|$|In the Byzantine Rite, (followed by the {{majority}} of Orthodox churches), the subdeacon's liturgical role is primarily that of servant to the bishop. He assists the bishop during hierarchical services, (services at which a hierarch/bishop is present and presiding) by vesting him, by looking after and presenting the trikiridikiri, placing the orletzi, operating the veil and Royal Doors, and handing the bishop and relieving him of all that he needs so as to enable him to perform his role of prayer undistracted. Outside of hierarchical services, the subdeacon serves in the altar as any other server but, as highest-ranking of the minor clergy, is responsible for co-ordinating and leading the serving team. In addition to the above duties, the subdeacon may read the reading from the Apostle at the Divine Liturgy if there is only one deacon.

40|$|Natural {{language}} {{provides a}} convenient means of communicating information, and as such, {{is an ideal}} medium for enabling non-expert users to teach robots novel tasks. However {{in order to take}} advantage of natural language, a series of challenges must first be overcome. These challenges include the need to - a) generalise learnt tasks to novel scenarios without retraining, - b) resolve problems encountered during task execution, and - c) derive implicit information from knowledge about the domain. To solve these challenges, this paper presents a novel approach to learning complex hierarchical tasks through natural language instruction, which not only allows learnt tasks to be generalised to novel situations without the need for retraining, but also enables an agent to derive implicit information from domain knowledge. Additionally, the approach presented in this paper enables the agent to infer task properties, such as preconditions and effects, directly from the explanation of the task flow. We validate our approach by demonstrating an implementation of our algorithms both on a simulated agent, as well as a Baxter robot. In each case, the agent is provided with a small set of primitive tasks for manipulating its workspace. From these primitives, we demonstrate the ability to teach the agent increasing complex tasks, including tasks of <b>table</b> <b>cleaning,</b> solely through natural language instructions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundHand grip {{strength}} is often considered may predict cognitive functioning {{and has been}} established as associates of cognitive performance with individual differences in some particular cross-sectional studies. However, {{little is known about}} hand {{grip strength}} and cognitive performance in the elderly individuals, and it is not known whether changes in hand grip strength may be associated with preservation/decline in cognitive functioning. ObjectivesWe have studied the impact of hand grip strength on cognition function in healthy kitchen workers. MethodsParticipants (n= 90, age range: 25 – 40 years) randomly assigned in to two groups according to their nature of work: Group I-Control group (n= 47) - workers recruited for simple work such as dusting, <b>cleaning</b> dining <b>tables</b> and floor. Group II-Study group (n= 43) - workers recruited for firm work such as cooking large quantity of food, kneading dough, rolling chapattis, cut and sauté the vegetables and dish washing. For the analyses, we used at dominant and non- dominant hand; hand grip strength (HGS), reaction time task, sensory disability test (SDT) and cognitive function test (CFT) among both the groups. ResultWe observed that visual reaction time (VRT) and auditory reaction time (ART) were significantly improved in dominant hand of study group, when compare to control group; however it was comparable in non-dominant hand among both the groups. In addition to; among all control and study group female workers there was significant positive correlation between VRT & ART and significant negative correlation between at dominant hand HGS & VRT as well as between at dominant hand HGS & ART. We also observed that dominant hand HGS {{was a significant predictor of}} VRT and ART and however there was no any significant variation in body mass index (BMI), sensory disability test (SDT) and cognitive function test (CFT) among both groups. ConclusionWe found that muscle strength (as measured by hand grip strength) was associated with improved reaction time. Hence by using a simple muscle strength test; is one way of obtaining useful information for the development of nerve-muscle coordination. Increased handgrip strength would be associated with preservation of cognitive function...|$|R

These reports contain reliable data and are generated by the Department of Environment, {{they are in a}} printable format (. pdf file) with number of pages, table of content, textual information, numerical information in tables, images. For a human being it is impossible to read the whole collection during a relatively short period (a few days or weeks) and understand the content of them. An automatic box of tools able to extract knowledge, to quick retrieve important term, to answer some exact questions about precise climate parameters would be an important help for lecturers. We will describe our project based upon a text and data mining process; the aims of the complex process are extract frequent temporal pattern, to extract association rules, to integrate also some information retrieval simple tools. In parallel, some data mining techniques will be used to detect the same types of data presented in every report and then to extract a numerical datamart containing climatological data structured by month, year, geographical area. The datamart will be analyzed also. The main steps of our mining process are: preparing documents (<b>cleaning,</b> removing images, <b>table</b> of contents, footnotes), transforming in structured document (in a XML format with a precise DTD), indexing, various algorithms and methods of mining, visualising results and validating knowledge.
