He gets his basic work done, <b>checking</b> <b>expense</b> accounts, auditing the city's books and meeting its payroll. Then, in his spare time, he quietly finds other ways to make himself useful. He has modernized the city's payroll operation. His office will soon be able to do cost-accounting, an efficiency that could save the city millions of dollars in the future." ...|$|R
5000|$|Wiggin [...] "chose not to" [...] {{take up the}} Committee's {{invitation}} to <b>check</b> his <b>expenses</b> with his bank and service providers and, on balance of probability they found he overclaimed expenses for council tax, telephone and workmen's bills.|$|R

60|$|I do {{not bother}} you {{with all my}} {{troubles}} in these outpourings; the troubles of the farmer are inspiriting - they are like difficulties out hunting - a fellow rages {{at the time and}} rejoices to recall and to commemorate them. My troubles have been financial. It is hard to arrange wisely interests so distributed. America, England, Samoa, Sydney, everywhere I have an end of liability hanging out and some shelf of credit hard by; and to juggle all these and build a dwelling-place here, and <b>check</b> <b>expense</b> - a thing I am ill fitted for - you can conceive what a nightmare it is at times. Then God knows I have not been idle. But since THE MASTER nothing has come to raise any coins. I believe the springs are dry at home, and now I am worked out, and can no more at all. A holiday is required.|$|R

"Oh, sir, on my sacred word of honour--" [...] An {{order on}} Mountjoy's bankers in Paris for the {{necessary}} amount, with something added for travelling <b>expenses,</b> <b>checked</b> Mr. Vimpany in full career of protestation. He tried to begin again: [...] "My friend! my benefactor--" ...|$|R
50|$|In 1908 Gaillard {{was placed}} in charge of {{construction}} of the central portion of the Panama Canal, crossing the continental divide. He {{was in charge of}} the notorious Culebra Cut through the backbone of the isthmus. Men who worked with him said he gave 12 hours every day to the Culebra Cut, besides which, he took his share in the labor of general administration of the Canal Zone. He <b>checked</b> up <b>expenses,</b> even on small things and once it was computed he had saved the Government $17,000,000.|$|R

I am in miserable health, and wish to become better acquainted with you before I die.

50|$|Virginia first concocts {{a scheme}} to have Kenneth sign five <b>checks</b> for {{household}} <b>expenses</b> at once using a mechanical device, one of B.J.'s many failures. Kenneth signs without noticing that one check is for $100,000, but when Virginia and B.J. go to the bank, Mr. Judd informs them that Kenneth has to authorize any check over $1000. Defeated, they return home.|$|R
500|$|Before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Southern's stock {{sold for}} around $146 (approximately $ as of [...] ), with {{an all-time high}} of just over $151 (approximately $ as of [...] ). In 1932 the stock hit a low of $2.50 (approximately $ as of [...] ). In 1929 Southern's freight traffic had been 8.4 billion {{ton-miles}}; it fell to 4.4 billion ton-miles in 1932. Southern's debt rose, and the company almost entered bankruptcy in 1932. Harrison ordered the payment of dividends to be halted in 1932, and many employees took pay cuts. Further efforts included a thorough <b>check</b> of <b>expenses,</b> with every item subjected to scrutiny to see what could be eliminated. By 1936 the railroad again showed a profit; this marked the turning point for the company {{in dealing with the}} Great Depression.|$|R
5000|$|Early in {{the fourth}} season, Sue Ellen (falsely accused of {{shooting}} J.R.) realized that her sister Kristin had shot J.R. and the truth {{came out in a}} poolside conversation between the three of them. Before J.R. (in a wheelchair) had a chance to digest this news flash, Kristin revealed that she was pregnant with J.R.s child. Instead of pressing charges against Kristin for the shooting, J.R. sent her packing out of town and agreed to send her a monthly <b>check</b> for living <b>expenses.</b>|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 55 - 56). Modern life {{offers a}} plethora of options of services and goods for consumers. As a result, people's expenses have gone up dramatically, e. g., compared to a decade ago, {{and the cost of}} living has been increasing day by day. Thus it becomes essential to keep a <b>check</b> on <b>expenses</b> in order to live a good life with a proper budget set up. The iPhone device, designed and marketed by Apple Inc., is one of the top-selling smartphones in the USA, and with the launch of the new iPhone 5 on September 21, 2012, whose sales have already surpassed the previous iPhone handsets (iPhone 4 S, iPhone 4) sales, it is apparent that people have been using smartphones as an organizational tool. XpensTrak, the Expense Tracker Mobile Application was developed for iPhone users to keep track of their expenses and determine whether they are spending as per their set budget. Potential users need to input the required data such as the expense amount, merchant, category, and date when the expense was made. Optional data such as sub-category and extra notes about the expense can be entered as well. The application allows users to track their expenses daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly in terms of summary, bar graphs, and pie-charts. This mobile application is a full detailed expense tracker tool that will not only help users keep a <b>check</b> on their <b>expenses,</b> but also cut down the unrequired expenses, and thus will help provide a responsible lifestyle. An analysis comparing existing expense tracking software with the one being introduced is provided...|$|R
5000|$|A {{photo of}} a burning Qur'an amid a pile of rubble, also taken by Hajj, seemed {{suspicious}} to Los Angeles Times media critic Tim Rutten, since the building it was in had been destroyed in an Israeli airstrike hours beforehand, and {{everything else in the}} photo was already ash. A number of photographs were taken from Lebanon showing various children's toys in the foreground, each surrounded by a pile of rubble. Rutten also wrote about this set, saying that [...] "Reuters might want to <b>check</b> its freelancers' <b>expenses</b> for unexplained Toys R Us purchases." ...|$|R
5000|$|The 1962 {{edition of}} the Gotham Bowl, played in Yankee Stadium, was {{particularly}} tormented with poor planning and bad luck. The Miami Hurricanes were invited, but no opponent could be found. Finally, on December 4, 1962, just eleven days before the game, the Gotham Bowl invited Nebraska, which had just finished an 8-2 season. However, {{the day before the}} contest, the pilot of the Cornhuskers' team plane refused to leave the Lincoln airport until the bowl's check for expenditures cleared, which it did. (Miami made a similar demand and received their $30,000 <b>expense</b> <b>check</b> up front.) ...|$|R
50|$|His {{work as a}} {{deep tillage}} machine {{salesman}} {{brought him to the}} area that would eventually be known as Vero Beach, Florida in 1914 to perform a demonstration on a local farm. Due to a late arriving <b>expense</b> <b>check</b> from his company, he stayed a few extra days at the Sleepy Eye Lodge which gave him time {{to get to know the}} area. He decided to buy a forty-acre tract of land and proceeded to buy the two neighboring 40 acre tracts during the following days. With $500 left in his pocket and at the advice of Doctor Leroy Hutchinson, Sexton limited his initial investment to 120 acres.|$|R
500|$|McEwen faced {{questions}} about the bounced checks he had written on the House bank. Buchert ran campaign commercials citing McEwen's <b>checks,</b> the <b>expenses</b> of his Congressional office, and his campaign finance disclosures, while noting Portman was [...] "the handpicked choice of the downtown money crowd" [...] and was [...] "a registered foreign agent for the biggest Democrat lobbying firm in Washington," [...] labeling Portman and McEwen [...] "Prince Rob and Bouncing Bob." [...] McEwen, who had taken a hard-line on his checks in 1992, relented in the campaign. Martin Gottlieb wrote, [...] "McEwen says now that his problem {{was a form of}} excessive pride. He says he used to 'demand perfection' of himself." [...] McEwen also said, [...] "I felt I could never admit a mistake.... I am very, very sorry. I should have watched it more carefully.... I have learned a great deal." [...] Les Spaeth, chairman of the Warren County Republican Party and former Warren County Auditor, said, [...] "People very much disliked the check overdraft thing, but I think they don't see it as happening again. I think it's past. He made a mistake and he got caught. But that's overridden by the service he's given, particularly to our county." ...|$|R
5000|$|Later, {{the main}} duty of {{universities}} in most Protestant countries was {{the training of}} future civil servants. Again, {{it was not in}} the interest of the state to charge tuition fees, as this would have decreased the quality of civil servants. On the other hand, the number of students from the lower classes was usually kept in <b>check</b> by the <b>expenses</b> of living during the years of study, although as early as the mid-19th century there were calls for limiting the university entrance by middle-class persons. A typical family, however, could not afford educating a child or young adult, even if the education itself was free. A similar situation exists today in many Third World countries, where the expenses of [...] "free" [...] schooling (food, books, school uniform, etc.) prevent some children from attending any school.|$|R
40|$|Thirty-four states, the District of Columbia and Canada were {{represented}} at POD 2 ̆ 7 s Fifth Annual Conference at Fairfield Glade, Tennessee. This introductory sentence should sound vaguely familiar {{to many of}} the Quarterly 2 ̆ 7 s readers, since it is numerically the same as last years 2 ̆ 7 opening summary report statement. Tennessee and Canada, with 13 participants each, wrested top honors from last year 2 ̆ 7 s winner, Texas, which fell from 16 to 9 participants. Other double-digit states were Ohio and Virginia, with 11 each, and California and Illinois, with 10 each. (Space considerations dictate the inclusion of this abridged version of the 1979 Conference Evaluation Report in the Quarterly. This does not mean, however, that POD is departing from its inclusionary policy. For your very own copy of the complete, unexpurgated, twenty-four-page (single-spaced) report, including seventeen tables and eleven displays, send me a check for 2. 50 to cover photocopying and mailing <b>expenses.</b> <b>Checks</b> should be made payable to the Evaluation and Training Institute. ...|$|R
40|$|Sharing of {{evaluation}} {{is crucial for}} the efficiency of lazy fnnc-tional languages, but unfortunately the machinery to imple-ment it carries an inherent overhead. In abstract machines this overhead shows up {{as the cost of}} performing updates, many of them actually unnecessary, and also in the cost of the associated bookkeeping, that is keeping track of when and where to update. In spineless abstract machines, such as the STG-machine and the TIM, this bookkeeping consists of pushing, checking for and popping update markers. Check-ing for update markers is a very frequent operation and indeed the implementation of the STG-machine has been optimised for fast update marker <b>checks</b> at the <b>expense</b> of making the pushing and popping of update markers more costly. In this paper we present a type based sharing analysis that can determine when updates can be safely omitted and marker checks bypassed. The type system is proved sound with respect to the lazy Krivine machine. We have imple-mented the analysis and the preliminary benchmarks seem very promising. Most notably, virtually all update marker checks can be avoided. This may make the tradeoffs of cur-machine designs...|$|R
50|$|Options {{are only}} {{beneficial}} to the record label. The fewer options allowed in the contract, the better for the act. An example: if an act's first and/or second album is successful, {{but there are no}} more options left, the label will re-sign the act all over again anyway. This time it will most likely be with a much better royalty rate and more creative freedom than the previous contract stated. Or, the act can decide to move to another label altogether, one that is offering a better royalty rate or creative freedom. However, when the label holds a clause for lots of options for additional albums, it has the advantage. Besides the scenario in the above paragraph of the label requesting albums it may not release and preventing the act from recording elsewhere, the exact opposite could happen instead. The act could release a blockbuster album on their very first release. The label will surely pick up its options for future albums and distribute them, but the act will continue to see all its royalty <b>checks</b> and recoupable <b>expenses</b> calculated under the same contract it signed many years ago. When its contract is finally up (with all those options), the act may have declined considerably in music popularity and may not have the same bargaining position that it had so many years ago when it released that blockbuster album. Had there been fewer options on the initial contract, the act could have negotiated a new and better contract while in its prime.|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} time, if I am able, and if I shall be permitted, I will lend an humble helping hand {{to any other}} good work which is going on. I have not, Sir, the frantic {{presumption}} to suppose that this plan contains in it the whole of what {{the public has a}} right to expect in the great work of reformation they call for. Indeed, it falls infinitely short of it. It falls short even of my own ideas. I have some thoughts, not yet fully ripened, relative to a reform in the customs and excise, as well as in some other branches of financial administration. There are other things, too, which form essential parts in a great plan for the purpose of restoring the independence of Parliament. The contractors' bill of last year it is fit to revive; and I rejoice that it is in better hands than mine. The bill for suspending the votes of custom-house officers, brought into Parliament several years ago by one of our worthiest and wisest members,[45]--would to God we could along with the plan revive the person who designed it! but a man of very real integrity, honor, and ability will be found to take his place, and to carry his idea into full execution. You all see how necessary it is to review our military expenses for some years past, and, if possible, to bind up and close that bleeding artery of profusion; but that business also, I have reason to hope, will be undertaken by abilities that are fully adequate to it. Something must be devised (if possible) to <b>check</b> the ruinous <b>expense</b> of elections.|$|R
