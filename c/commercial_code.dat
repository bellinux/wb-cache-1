5|$|After the Congress of Vienna {{there was}} a degree of {{commercial}} cooperation between the various German states resulting {{in the setting of}} the German Customs Union (Zollverein). There were however still many barriers to trade until Bavaria took the lead in establishing the General German <b>Commercial</b> <b>Code</b> in 1856. As part of the code the Zollverein introduce the Zollpfund (Customs Pound) which was defined to be exactly 500g and which could be split into 30'lot'. This unit was used for inter-state movement of goods, but was not applied in all states for internal use.|$|E
5|$|Since {{substitute}} {{checks are}} considered legal checks, substitute checks {{are subject to}} existing check laws and regulations. Other laws and regulations that govern substitute checks in the United States include the Expedited Funds Availability Act, Article3 (Negotiable Instruments), and Article4 (Bank Deposits and Collections) of the Uniform <b>Commercial</b> <b>Code</b> (UCC), along {{with a variety of}} state and federal regulatory laws. U.S. federal laws that also affect substitute checks include Federal Reserve regulations that provide for recrediting the amount of the substitute check in the case of fraud and duplicate payments caused by settlement of both the substitute check and the original check used for creating the substitute check. If any state law, federal law, or provision of the UCC conflicts with the Check21Act, the Check21Act takes precedence to the extent of the inconsistencies among those laws and provisions.|$|E

25|$|In the State of Buenos Aires, an {{initiative}} {{to launch a}} Civil Code suffered the same fate. On October 17, 1857, a law was passed that authorized the Executive Branch to spend the necessary funds to compile the Civil, Criminal and Procedural Codes, but the initiative was ultimately frustrated. However, the <b>Commercial</b> <b>Code</b> had better luck. The task of compiling that code {{had been given to}} Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield and Eduardo Acevedo Maturana, who sent it to the legislature for its approval. The <b>Commercial</b> <b>Code</b> of the State of Buenos Aires was finally passed in 1859, and it was this code that was adopted at the national level in 1862 and amended in 1889.|$|E
25|$|Until recent times, the Civil Code {{has only}} been {{partially}} reformed, the most notable reform effort being that associated with Law 17.711.

25|$|Before the Civil Code, {{there had}} been several {{attempts}} to this effect, without success. In 1824, Juan Gregorio de las Heras issued a decree appointing one commission charged with compiling the <b>Commercial</b> <b>Code</b> and another charged with compiling the Military Code, but neither of these two projects' efforts came to fruition. In 1831, the Legislature of Buenos Aires adopted the Spanish <b>Commercial</b> <b>Code</b> compiled in 1829 and created a commission to see to any reforms to it that might be necessary. In 1852, Justo José de Urquiza created a commission of 14 members for the compilation of the Civil, Penal, Commercial and Procedural Codes. However, the revolution of September 11 of that year, {{which resulted in the}} secession of the Province of Buenos Aires from the Argentine Confederacy, prevented this project from making any concrete progress.|$|E

The modelling of multilayer window structures using conventional <b>commercial</b> <b>codes</b> is time consuming and prone to numerical instabilities as the layer thicknesses are significantly less than a wavelength. We have used a scattering matrix approach to analyse the frequency dependence of the window reflection co-efficient combined with an automatic optimisation routine which determines the optimum layer thickness for maximum window return loss within the parameter space allowed by the operator. Results from these simulations are compared to both conventional <b>commercial</b> <b>codes</b> (Microwave Studio) and laboratory experiments...|$|R
40|$|Members of the {{aerospace}} fan community have systematically developed computational methods {{over the last}} five decades. The complexity of the developed methods and the difficulty associated with their practical application ensured that, although <b>commercial</b> computational <b>codes</b> date back to the 1980 s, they were not fully exploited by industrial fan designers until the beginning of the 2000 s. The application of <b>commercial</b> <b>codes</b> proved to be problematic as, unlike aerospace fans, industrial fans include electrical motors and other components from which the flow will invariably separate. Consequently, industrial fan designers found the application of <b>commercial</b> <b>codes</b> challenging. The decade from 2000 to 2010 was focused on developing techniques that would facilitate converged solutions that predicted the fans' performance characteristics over the stable part of their operating range with reasonable accuracy, using a practical computational effort. In this paper, we focus on elucidating aspects of the flow physics that one cannot easily study in a laboratory environment, discussing the challenges involved and the relative merits of the available modelling techniques. The paper ends with a discussion of the practical problems {{associated with the use of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>codes</b> in a development environment and finally the legislation that is driving the need for aerospace style computation methods. © 2013 Alessandro Corsini et al...|$|R

A brief description of the model is presented, followed by discussion of implementation and usage in the <b>commercial</b> <b>codes.</b> Results are presented from static and dynamic analysis of SMAHC beams of two types; a beam clamped at each end and a cantilevered beam. Nonlinear static (post-buckling) and random response analyses are demonstrated for the first specimen. Static deflection (shape) control is demonstrated for the cantilevered beam. Approaches for modeling SMAHC material systems with embedded SMA in ribbon and small round wire product forms are demonstrated and compared.

25|$|In {{spite of}} the {{stability}} brought by the civil code to the Argentine law system, it was subject to various modifications throughout its history, as was necessary to adequately regulate a society undergoing significant social, political and economical changes. The most important reform was Law 17.711 of April 22, 1968. Not only did the law change around 5% of the complete article, {{it is especially important}} due to the change in orientation regarding some regulated institutions. There were also other reform projects that were not implemented.

25|$|Aside from a {{contract}} that creates a security interest to back repayment of a debt, creditors to a company, and particularly trade creditors may deploy two main equivalents security. The effect is to produce proprietary rights which place them ahead of the general body of creditors. First, a trade creditor who sells goods to a company (which may go into insolvency) can contract for a retention of title clause. This means {{that even though the}} seller of goods may have passed possession to a buyer, until the price of sale is paid, the seller has never passed property. The company and creditor agree that title to the property is retained by the seller until the date of payment. In the leading case, Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd a Dutch company making aluminium foil stipulated in its contract with Romalpa Aluminium Ltd that when it supplied the foil, ownership would only passed once the price had been paid, and that any products made by Romalpa would be held by them as bailees. When Romalpa went insolvent, another creditor claimed that its floating charge covered the foil and products. The Court of Appeal held, however, that property in the foil had never become part of Romalpa's estate, and so could not be covered by the charge. Furthermore, the clause was not void for want to registration because only assets belonging to the company and then charged needed to be registered. In later cases, the courts have held that if property is mixed during a manufacturing process so that it is no longer identifiable, or if it is sold onto a buyer, then the retention of title clause ceases to have effect. If the property is something that can be mixed (such as oil) and the clause prohibits this, then the seller may retain a percentage share of the mixture as a tenant in common. But if the clause purports to retain title over no more than a part of the property, Re Bond Worth Ltd held that the clause must take effect in equity, and so requires registration. The present requirements in the Companies Act 2006 section 860 continue not to explicitly cover retention of title clauses, in contrast to the registration requirements in the US Uniform <b>Commercial</b> <b>Code</b> article 9. This requires that anything with the same effect as a security interest requires registration, and so covers retention of title provision.|$|E
