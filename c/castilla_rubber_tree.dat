50|$|Moon vine (I. alba) sap {{was used}} for {{vulcanization}} of the latex of <b>Castilla</b> elastica (Panama <b>rubber</b> <b>tree,</b> Nahuatl: olicuáhuitl) to rubber; as it happens, the <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> seems well-suited for the vine to twine upon, and the two species are often found together.

2500|$|The name [...] "Olmec" [...] means [...] "rubber people" [...] in Nahuatl, the {{language}} of the Aztec, and was the Aztec name for the people who lived in the Gulf Lowlands in the 15th and 16th centuries, some 2000 years after the Olmec culture died out. The term [...] "rubber people" [...] refers to the ancient practice, spanning from ancient Olmecs to Aztecs, of extracting latex from <b>Castilla</b> elastica, a <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> in the area. The juice of a local vine, Ipomoea alba, was then mixed with this latex to create rubber as early as 1600BCE.|$|R
50|$|Natural rubber {{originates}} {{from the}} latex of the <b>rubber</b> <b>tree,</b> which is acquired by {{tapping into the}} bark layers of the <b>rubber</b> <b>tree.</b> <b>Rubber</b> <b>trees</b> belong to the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae) and only survive in hot, humid tropical climates near the equator, so the majority of latex is produced in the Southeast Asian countries of Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia.|$|R
40|$|Phloem turgor {{pressure}} (PTP) is the initial driving force for latex flow after a <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> is tapped and therefore {{plays an important}} role in <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> latex production. Variation in PTP with <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> clone, age, yield potential and commonly used Ethrel (an ethylene releaser) stimulation have, however, not been comprehensively studied to date. The aim of this study was to investigate these relations and examine whether PTP can be used as an index for <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> clone assessment and tapping system optimization. The results showed that: (1) the daily change of PTP in the foliation season suggests that a high PTP can ensure a high latex yield and tapping could be moved forward to midnight or earlier in the night; (2) the decrease of PTP from the basal to distal stem indicates the benefit of a controlled upward tapping system; (3) the logarithmic increase in PTP with <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> planting age and age-based mean girth suggests that the preferred age for the commencement of <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> tapping is eight years; (4) the change of PTP with regenerated bark age suggests that the regenerated bark could be exploited again after the second year; (5) PTP is positively related to the yield potential of <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> clones; (6) although Ethrel stimulation could not significantly increase the initial PTP of a <b>rubber</b> <b>tree,</b> it delays the recovery of PTP after tapping. Therefore, PTP is an indicator of <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> latex yield and can be used for tapping system optimization. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

40|$|Regarding <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> plantations, {{researchers}} lack a {{basic understanding}} of soil microbial communities; specifically, little is known about whether or not soil microbial variation is correlated with succession in these plantations. In this paper, we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene to investigate the diversity and composition of the soil bacterial communities in a chronosequence of <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> plantations that were 5, 10, 13, 18, 25, and 30 years old. We determined that: (1) Soil bacterial diversity and composition show changes over the succession stages of <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> plantations. The diversity of soil bacteria were highest in 10, 13, and 18 year-old <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> plantations, followed by 30 year-old <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> plantations, whereas 5 and 25 year-old <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> plantations had the lowest values for diversity.

The gene expression for eight of these genes was validated by qRT-PCR in both RRIC 52 and the partially susceptible Reyan 7 - 33 - 97 cultivars, revealing the similar or differential changes of gene expressions between these two cultivars.

The high level of the outcrossing rate show that pollinations are realized between trees of different genotypes. The fixation index (FIS) decrease from the parental population to the descendantʼs one where it is not significantly different from zero. So crossings are panmictics, and the fertilizations between the related trees are practically inexistent. The rate of self-fertilization is mostly due to the real self-fertilizations between the ovuls and the pollen coming from the same origin.
