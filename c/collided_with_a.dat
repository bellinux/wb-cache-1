40|$|We {{review the}} {{scientific}} motivation {{of the development}} of asymmetric #I factories and discuss the various options. We describe two specific options: (1) a high energy e-linac <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> low energy e+ storage ring, (2) a high energy e- storage ring <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> low energy e+ storage ring. A critical comparison of these options will be discussed. ...|$|R
50|$|Inelastic {{scattering}} {{is seen in}} {{the interaction}} between an electron and a photon. When <b>a</b> high-energy photon <b>collides</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> free electron and transfers energy, the process is called Compton scattering. Furthermore, when <b>an</b> electron <b>with</b> relativistic energy <b>collides</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> infrared or visible photon, the electron gives energy to the photon; this process is called inverse Compton scattering.|$|R

5|$|There {{has been}} no serious {{accident}} in the immediate area around Victoria station. On 26 February 1884, an explosion occurred in the cloak-room of the Brighton side injuring seven staff, {{as part of the}} Fenian dynamite campaign. On 27 August 1910, an empty LB stock train derailed due to inadequate signalling arrangements, leading to four injuries. On 17 July 1946, a light engine <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> passenger train; several people were injured. On 15 December 1959, a passenger train <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rake of parcels vans. At least eleven people were injured.|$|E
30|$|The {{involvement}} {{of a third}} party is highly related to injury occurrence to bus passengers. While considering <b>colliding</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> car as the reference case, accidents with vulnerable road users (i.e., pedestrians, cyclists, moped riders, motorcyclists) have less severe consequences with the probability of on-board injury occurrence reducing by a factor between 2 and 3. The likelihood of injury occurrence to bus passengers slightly increases by 20.9  % when <b>a</b> bus <b>collides</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> van and substantially rises by 316.1  % when <b>a</b> bus <b>collides</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heavy vehicle. Interestingly, the likelihood of on-board injury occurrence largely grows (186.3  %) when a bus crashes into an object (e.g., tree, pole, wall).|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades a {{considerable}} number of studies have been made on impact dynamics. Zheng and Hemami discussed a mathematical model of <b>a</b> robot that <b>collides</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> environment (Zheng & Hemami, 1985).

5|$|On 18 January 1986, a Class 104 diesel {{multiple}} unit suffered a brake failure, passed three signals at danger and <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Class 47 diesel-electric locomotive near Preston. Forty-four people were injured.|$|E
5|$|On 18 June 1925, {{electric}} locomotive No. 4 <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> passenger train at Baker Street station when a signal was changed from green to red {{just as the}} locomotive was passing it. Six people were injured.|$|E

5|$|On 16 January 1958, a {{passenger}} train <b>collided</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> light engine which was standing foul {{of the line}} and was derailed. The light engine ended up on its side.
