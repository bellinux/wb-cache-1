40|$|The {{internal}} {{borders in}} the European Union were opened {{more than twenty}} years ago. However, a comprehensive and coordinated spatial vision for the border landscape is yet to be composed. Bureaucratic <b>cooperation</b> <b>procedures</b> in combination with new nationalistic sentiments in the EU only seem to block further effective cross-border cooperation. In this paper we make the plea for a new design for cross-borderscapes. We argue that scientists, artists, architects and filmmakers could seize the opportunity together in creating more inclusive, imaginative as well as critically engaged cartographic designs on borders, as theatrical ways of portraying the world. The arguments are exemplified by drawing on the recently published book ‘Borderland’ in which, based on an in-depth analysis of the borderland of the Netherlands-Belgium-Germany, a new cartographic design for the borderland was developed...|$|R

The Financial Transaction Tax can no longer be blocked by the Council of the European Union on legal grounds, but each individual EU member state is still entitled to launch legal complaints against a finally approved FTT to the European Court of Justice, potentially annulling the scheme.

40|$|The paper {{reports on}} the {{activity}} of the Center for Satellite based Crisis Information (ZKI) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) {{in the aftermath of the}} devastating earthquake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti on 12 January 2010.

All DLR/ZKI damage maps are based on a specific analysis approach, including pre-processing procedures and visual interpretation on a grid-basis. As the satellite-based mapping response globally was so extensive for this event, problems resulting from the large number and inconsistency of satellite maps generated internationally are addressed. In order to avoid this kind of "mapping challenge" in future the setting-up of an international working group to elaborate global guidelines and <b>cooperation</b> <b>procedures</b> for better coherence of international satellite rapid mapping efforts for extreme events such as the Haiti earthquake is suggested...|$|R
40|$|Cooperative {{localization}} is {{an important}} technique in wireless networks. However, there are always errors in network node localization, which will spatially propagate among network nodes when performing network localization. In this paper, we study the spatial error propagation characteristics of network localization, in terms of Fisher information. Firstly, the spatial propagation function is proposed to reveal the spatial cooperation principle of network localization. Secondly, the convergence property of spatial localization information propagation is analyzed {{to shed light on}} the performance limits of network localization through spatial information propagation. It is shown that, (ı) the network localization error propagates in a way of the Ohm’s law in electric circuit theory, where the measurement accuracy, node location accuracy and geometric-resolution information behave like the resistances connected in parallel or series; (ıı) the network location error gradually diminishes with spatial localization <b>cooperation</b> <b>procedures,</b> due to the cooperative localization information propagation; (ııı) the essence of spatial localization cooperation among network nodes is the spatial propagation of localization information...|$|R

40|$|The study {{examined}} the effects of the availability of a non-cooperative response on cooperative responding when cooperation did not have to result in an equal distribution of work or reinforcers. Also, an attempt was made to determine if the cooperative responding was {{under the control of the}} <b>cooperation</b> <b>procedure.</b> Pairs of institutionalized retardates were tested in full view of each other. For each subject, reinforcers (money) were contingent upon responses on each of two panels: (1) a matching panel for working matching-to-sample problems, and (2) a sample panel for producing the sample stimulus. The matching panels of the two subjects were 6 m apart, but a subject's sample panel could be placed at different distances from his matching panel. For each subject, either his own or his partner's sample panel could be nearest his matching panel such that less walking was required to reach one sample panel than the other. Subjects could work either individually, by producing their own sample stimulus, or cooperatively, by producing the sample stimulus for their partner. Subjects selected whichever solution involved the least amount of walking. The importance of testing for control by the <b>cooperation</b> <b>procedure</b> was indicated by the findings that cooperative-like responses were not always under the control of the <b>cooperation</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|E

40|$|Among {{the many}} {{objections}} to Turkish {{membership in the}} European Union lie claims that Turkey will be a powerful actor in the future EU, with a population as large as or larger than Germany. Many also claim that this power will have negative effects on the EU. We examine such claims analytically, influenced strongly by spatial models of EU policy-making. We find that Turkey’s preferences lie sufficiently outside the EU mainstream {{so that it will}} have little influence in day-to-day policy-making under the assent, codecision, consultation, and <b>cooperation</b> <b>procedures</b> (or the common procedure in the rejected constitutional treaty). Its influence may be more evident in areas such as the CFSP or JHA, where unanimity remains the normal procedure. Still, Turkey’s veto power here is no different from that of other, much smaller countries. Furthermore, veto power can only block changes and cannot be used to pull the EU into undesirable new directions. Even this veto power can be avoided if the EU- 25 establishes whatever policies they desire prior to Turkish membership, forcing Turkey to accept a fait accompli. Despite these limitations to its power, Turkey may have some influence in purely intergovernmental settings such as negotiations over new treaties that might occur some decades hence...|$|R
