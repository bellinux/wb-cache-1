40|$|Very little {{research}} has been conducted on the effects of snacking on driving performance. The first aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the effects of a mid-morning <b>cereal</b> <b>bar</b> on hazard perception while driving. Fifty one participants completed the study. Hazard perception was assessed using two commercially available DVDs. Participants carried out a baseline session and then consumed either a mid morning <b>cereal</b> <b>bar</b> or nothing. The results showed that those who consumed the <b>cereal</b> <b>bar</b> performed better on the hazard perception task than those who had no snack. Further research is needed to determine what underlies this beneficial effect. It is speculated that it may reflect the high carbohydrate composition of the <b>cereal</b> <b>bar...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecent studies {{report that}} using green labels to denote {{healthier}} foods, and red to denote less healthy foods increases consumption of green- and decreases consumption of red-labelled foods. Other symbols (e. g. emoticons conveying normative approval and disapproval) {{could also be}} used to signal the healthiness and/or acceptability of consuming such products. The present study tested the combined effects of using emoticons and colours on labels amongst a nationally representative sample of the UK population (n[*]=[*] 955). In a 3 (emoticon expression: smiling vs. frowning vs. no emoticon) [*]×[*] 3 (colour label: green vs. red vs. white) [*]× 2 (food option: chocolate <b>bar</b> vs. <b>cereal</b> <b>bar)</b> between-subjects experiment, participants rated the level of desirability, healthiness, tastiness, and calorific content of a snack bar they had been randomised to view. At the end they were further randomised to view one of nine possible combinations of colour and emoticon labels and asked to choose between a chocolate and a <b>cereal</b> <b>bar.</b> Regardless of label, participants rated the chocolate as tastier and more desirable when compared to the <b>cereal</b> <b>bar,</b> and the <b>cereal</b> <b>bar</b> as healthier than the chocolate bar. A series of interactions revealed that a frowning emoticon on a white background decreased perceptions of healthiness and tastiness of the <b>cereal</b> <b>bar,</b> but not the chocolate bar. In the explicit choice task selection was unaffected by label. Overall nutritional labels had limited effects on perceptions and no effects on choice of snack foods. Emoticon labels yielded stronger effects on perceptions of taste and healthiness of snacks than colour labels. Frowning emoticons may be more potent than smiling emoticons at influencing the perceived healthiness and tastiness of foods carrying health halos...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis work proposes an {{analytical}} method for <b>cereal</b> <b>bar</b> classification {{based on the}} use of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and supervised pattern recognition techniques. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is employed to build a classification model {{on the basis of a}} reduced subset of variables (wavenumbers). For the purpose of variable selection, three techniques are considered, namely successive projection algorithm (SPA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and stepwise (SW) formulation. The methodology is validated in a case study involving the classification of 121 <b>cereal</b> <b>bar</b> samples into three different types (conventional, diet and light). The results show that the LDA/GA model is superior to the LDA/SPA and LDA/SW models with respect to classification accuracy in an independent prediction set. Some advantages of the proposed method are speed, that the analytical measurement is performed quickly (one minute or less per sample), no reagents, low sample consumption and minimum sample preparation demands. In view of the results obtained in this study the proposed method may be considered valid for use in <b>cereal</b> <b>bar</b> classification...|$|R

40|$|Probiotics are {{commonly}} included in dairy products. These products require cold storage and transportation which limits their use. We {{have investigated the}} inclusion of a probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis strain in a dry food matrix, an oat-based <b>cereal</b> <b>bar,</b> and its detection in faeces after consumption of this product. From four of the nine subjects whom consumed the <b>cereal</b> <b>bar</b> for a week, B. lactis could be identified in the faeces using a culture independent technique (fluorescent in situ hybridisation). This detection frequency was not different from earlier reports where B. lactis was consumed in fermented or non-fermented dairy products. One week after cessation of B. lactis feed-ing, it could be identified in the faeces of five of the nine subjects. This de-tection frequency is better than most other studies where B. lactis had been included in dairy products. The inclusion of B. lactis in an oat-based <b>cereal</b> <b>bar</b> appears to be equally well or better than inclusion in a dairy product and may therefore provide an alternative means of administering probiotics.
