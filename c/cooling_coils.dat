25|$|On the air side of HVAC coils a {{significant}} difference exists between those used for heating, and those for cooling. Due to psychrometrics, air that is cooled often has moisture condensing out of it, except with extremely dry air flows. Heating some air increases that airflow's capacity to hold water. So heating coils need not consider moisture condensation on their air-side, but <b>cooling</b> <b>coils</b> must be adequately designed and selected to handle their particular latent (moisture) {{as well as the}} sensible (cooling) loads.

Chilled water is supplied from a chiller that is potentially located very far away, but refrigerant must come from a nearby condensing unit.

40|$|The {{logarithmic}} mean enthalpy difference, (LMED) method {{has been extensively}} used in evaluating the thermal performance of an air <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> under wet condition.

Consequently, errors can be resulted in when calculating the total heat transfer rate of a wet <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> using the LMED method. Therefore, a modified LMED (m-LMED) method has been developed for calculating the total heat transfer rate under both unit and non-unit Lewis Factors and is reported in this paper.

50|$|However, many window {{air conditioners}} are {{designed}} to dispose of condensate water by re-evaporating it into the exhaust air stream, which cancels out the air humidity decrease caused by the condensation of moisture on the <b>cooling</b> <b>coils.</b> To be effective as a dehumidifier, an air conditioner must be designed or modified so that {{most or all of}} the water that condenses is drained away in liquid form, rather than re-evaporated.

50|$|A {{lambda point}} {{refrigerator}} is a device used to cool liquid helium, typically around a superconducting magnet or for low temperature measurements, from approximately 4.2 K to temperatures near the lambda point of helium (approximately 2.17 K), the temperature at which normal fluid helium (helium I) transitions to the superfluid helium II. Cooling {{is achieved by}} pumping the liquid helium in the bath through a <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> via a needle valve and vacuum pump. The reduced pressure in the coil causes some of the helium to evaporate, creating a two-phase system within the <b>cooling</b> <b>coil.</b> The heat removed via evaporation lowers {{the temperature of the}} <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> closer to the lambda point. Since the <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> is immersed in the liquid helium bath, liquid surrounding the <b>coil</b> is also <b>cooled.</b> The colder, higher density liquid sinks away from the coil toward the bottom of the bath while the warmer, lower density liquid helium rises to the top. Liquid helium typically has poor thermal conductivity, so convective currents associated with a temperature gradient in the bath provide a constant flow of this colder liquid helium toward the bottom of the bath, allowing temperatures below 4.2 K to be realized in the helium bath, typically close to 2.2 K.|$|R
