5000|$|Faraday's ice pail {{experiment}} {{is a simple}} electrostatics experiment performed in 1843 by British scientist Michael Faraday that demonstrates the effect of electrostatic induction on a conducting container. For a container, Faraday used a metal pail made to hold ice, which gave the experiment its name. The experiment shows that an electric charge enclosed inside a <b>conducting</b> <b>shell</b> induces an equal charge on the shell, and that in an electrically conducting body, the charge resides entirely on the surface. [...] It also demonstrates the principles behind electromagnetic shielding such as employed in the Faraday cage. [...] The ice pail experiment was the first precise quantitative experiment on electrostatic charge. [...] It is still used today in lecture demonstrations and physics laboratory courses to teach the principles of electrostatics.|$|E
50|$|Near the {{beginning}} of the memoir is established the celebrated formula connecting surface and volume integrals, which is now generally called Green's Theorem, and of which Poisson's result on the equivalent surface - and volume - distributions of magnetization is a particular application. By using this theorem to investigate the properties of the potential, Green arrived at many results of remarkable beauty and interest. We need only mention, {{as an example of the}} power of his method, the following: — Suppose that there is a hollow <b>conducting</b> <b>shell,</b> bounded by two closed surfaces, and that a number of electrified bodies are placed, some within and some without it; and let the inner surface and interior bodies be called the interior system, and the outer surface and exterior bodies be called the exterior system. Then all the electrical phenomena of the interior system, relative to attractions, repulsions, and densities, will be the same as if there were no exterior system, and the inner surface were a perfect conductor, put in communication with the earth; and all those of the exterior system will be the same as if the interior system did not exist, and the outer surface were a perfect conductor, containing a quantity of electricity equal to the whole of that originally contained in the shell itself and in all the interior bodies. It will be evident that electrostatics had by this time attained a state of development in which further progress could be hoped for only in the mathematical superstructure, unless experiment should unexpectedly bring to light phenomena of an entirely new character.|$|E

Propagation of surface-plasmon waves along an MWCNT with a gold core was also analyzed.

40|$|In {{nearly all}} {{magnetic}} fusion devices the plasma {{is surrounded by}} a <b>conducting</b> <b>shell</b> of some description. In most cases this is the vacuum vessel. What effect does a <b>conducting</b> <b>shell</b> have on the stability of external kink modes? Is there any major difference between the effect of a perfectly <b>conducting</b> <b>shell</b> and a shell of finite conductivity? What happens if the shell is incomplete? These, and other, questions are explored in detail in this lecture using simple resistive magnetohydrodynamic (resistive MHD) arguments. Although the lecture concentrates on one particular type of magnetic fusion device, namely, the tokamak, the analysis is fairly general and could also be used to examine the effect of conducting shells on other types of device (e. g.

40|$|The present {{invention}} is for particulate compositions {{and methods}} for producing them that can absorb or scatter electromagnetic radiation. The particles are homogeneous in size and are comprised of a nonconducting inner layer that is surrounded by an electrically conducting material. The ratio of {{the thickness of the}} nonconducting layer to the thickness of the outer <b>conducting</b> <b>shell</b> is determinative of the wavelength of maximum absorbance or scattering of the particle. Unique solution phase methods for synthesizing the particles involve linking clusters of the conducting atoms, ions, or molecules to the nonconducting inner layer by linear molecules.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{electric}} propulsion is explored where plasmoids such as spheromaks and field reversed configurations (FRC) are formed and then allowed to expand down a diverging <b>conducting</b> <b>shell.</b> The plasmoids contain a toroidal electric current that provides both heating and a confining magnetic field. They {{are free to}} translate {{because there are no}} externally supplied magnetic fields that would restrict motion. Image currents in the diverging <b>conducting</b> <b>shell</b> keep the plasmoids from contacting the wall. Because these currents translate relative to the wall, losses due to magnetic flux diffusion into the wall are minimized. During the expansion of the plasma in the diverging cone, both the inductive and thermal plasma energy are converted to directed kinetic energy producing thrust. Specific impulses can be in the 4000 to 20000 sec range with thrusts from 0. 1 to 1000 Newtons, depending on available power...|$|E

The solution is incorporated into the various MHD stability codes either through the volume integrated perturbed magnetic energy in the vacuum region or through the continuity requirements for the normal component of the perturbed magnetic field and the total perturbed pressure across the unperturbed plasma-vacuum boundary. The method is based upon using Green`s second identity and the method of collocation. As useful byproducts, the eddy currents and the simulation of Mirnov loop measurements are calculated...|$|R
40|$|High-permeability {{magnetic}} shields generate {{magnetic field}} noise that can limit {{the sensitivity of}} modern precision measurements. We show that calculations based on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem allow quantitative evaluation of magnetic field noise, either from current or magnetization fluctuations, inside enclosures made of high-permeability materials. Explicit analytical formulas for the noise are derived for a few axially symmetric geometries, which are compared with results of numerical finite element analysis. Comparison is made between noises caused by current and magnetization fluctuations inside a high-permeability shield and also between current-fluctuation-induced noises inside magnetic and non-magnetic <b>conducting</b> <b>shells.</b> A simple model is suggested to predict power-law decay of noise spectra beyond quasi-static regime. Our results {{can be used to}} assess noise from existing shields and to guide design of new shields for precision measurements. Comment: 10 page...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{characteristics}} of stellarators, both helical and modular, is that their coil sets must take difficult shapes {{in order to produce}} the complicated stellarator magnetic fields. The complex coil shapes make fabrication difficult and costly compared to say the toroidal field, TF, coil set of a tokamak. The <b>conducting</b> <b>shell</b> stellarator, CSS, configuration described in this report shows that complicated stellarator fields can be produced by inducing eddy currents in a <b>conducting</b> <b>shell</b> from a simple TF coil set (a field that varies like 1 /R). This technique is applicable not only to a pulsed system at room or cryogenic temperatures, but can be implemented for a superconducting TF with a superconducting shell in a stellarator reactor. The CSS has the added benefit that within this device the metallic shell which can be made up of discrete plates can be changed out and replaced with new plates to create a different stellarator configuration within the same TF coil set. The work of creating the complicated magnetics is done by the passive conductor reshaping the simple TF field...|$|E

40|$|This note takes a {{fresh look}} at two {{classical}} EM shielding problems involving an integral imperfectly conducting spherical shell and a perfectly conducting hollow sphere with an aperture. Previous studies of the EM shielding provided by these objects have concentrated on evaluating the E- and H-fields {{at the center of the}} shield, where only one term of the spherical wave function expansion is needed. While the internal H-field in the shielded volume of the <b>conducting</b> <b>shell</b> is very close to being constant, the same is not true for the E-field, where there can be a significant variation in the E-field intensity from point to point within the interior. For both of these canonical shielding problems, the analysis method is reviewed and it is then applied to determine cumulative probability distributions for the internal fields. In implementing the analysis for the <b>conducting</b> <b>shell,</b> the use of scaled Hankel functions is described. This is used to avoid numerical difficulties in evaluating the spherical harmonic solution for lossy media. Additionally, closed-form expressions for the wave expansion coefficients in the spherical coordinate system are derived. The treatment of the hollow sphere with an aperture is obtained using a quasi-static model that likewise permits the determinatio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Since Maxwell’s {{theory is}} a gauge theory, {{it is quite}} {{important}} to evaluate the corresponding zero-point energy by a careful assignment of boundary conditions on the potential and on the ghost fields. Recent work by the authors has shown that, for a perfectly <b>conducting</b> spherical <b>shell,</b> {{it is precisely the}} contribution of longitudinal and normal modes of the potential which enables one to reproduce the result first due to Boyer. For arbitrary values of a gauge parameter, however, the difficult problem remains of having to solve an entangled system of three eigenvalue equations. Such a problem is crucial both for the foundations and for the applications of quantum field theory. 1 The present paper is a concise presentation of recent work by the authors [1], where the zero-point energy of a perfectly <b>conducting</b> spherical <b>shell</b> has been studied with emphasis on the electromagnetic potential Aµ with the corresponding ghost fields. The main steps of our approach are as follows.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{efficient}} methods for protecting electro-explosive devices (EED's) from HERO and ESD is to shield the EED in a <b>conducting</b> <b>shell</b> (Faraday cage). Electrical energy is transferred to the bridge {{by means of a}} magnetic coupling which passes through a portion of the <b>conducting</b> <b>shell</b> that is made from a magnetically permeable but electrically conducting material. This technique was perfected by ML Aviation, a U. K. company, in the early 80 's, and was called a Radio Frequency Attenuation Connector (RFAC). It is now in wide use in the U. K. Previously, the disadvantage of RFAC over more conventional methods was its relatively high cost, largely driven by a thick film hybrid circuit used to switch the primary of the transformer. Recently, through a licensing agreement, this technology has been transferred to the U. S. and significant cost reductions and performance improvements have been achieved by the introduction of analog integrated circuits. An integrated circuit performs the following functions: (1) Chops the DC input to a signal suitable for driving the primary of the transformer; (2) Verifies the input voltage is above a threshold; (3) Verifies the input voltage is valid for a pre set time before enabling the device; (4) Provides thermal protection of the circuit; and (5) Provides an external input for independent logic level enabling of the power transfer mechanism. This paper describes the new RFAC product and its applications...|$|E
40|$|Consider an {{axisymmetric}} equilibrium in a configuration {{where the}} current density j has only r and z components, and the magnetic field, accordingly, has only the {var_phi} component. Such configurations {{are of interest}} for magnetized target fusion (MTF) [1]: they include a simple diffuse Z pinch configuration and a MAGO configuration. Both can be, in principle, imploded by <b>conducting</b> <b>shells</b> to create a plasma with fusion-grade parameters. To be of interest for fusion, these configurations have to provide MHD equilibria acceptable {{from the viewpoint of}} confinement requirements. In the present note the authors analyze possible equilibria and show that only equilibria where the plasma pressure is a function of a radial coordinate (no axial dependence) are possible. A framework for such an analysis is outlined, e. g., in Shafranov's survey in ``Reviews of Plasma Physics''. In an arbitrary geometry the analysis may be quite cumbersome. What the authors show here is, that in the geometry of the type of an axisymmetric Z pinch equilibrium analysis is reduced to a set of simple algebraic relations, and allows one to come to very robust and reliable conclusions with regard to the possible equilibria...|$|R
