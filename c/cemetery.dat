For cemeteries in France and Belgium, a land tablet near the entrance or along a wall identifies the <b>cemetery</b> grounds as having been provided by the French or Belgian governments. All but the smallest cemeteries contain a register with an inventory of the burials, a plan of the plots and rows, and a basic history of the <b>cemetery.</b> The register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the <b>cemetery</b> entrance or in a shelter within the <b>cemetery.</b> More recently, in larger sites, a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign. The headstones within the <b>cemetery</b> are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size.|$|E
