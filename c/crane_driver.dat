The second stoppage was due to an incident involving Russell Spence. After his car spun, blocking the road, a crane came to move his car. Spence was still in the car, and frantically waving at the <b>crane</b> <b>driver</b> to put his car down facing the right way. The car was lowered, but not in the right place and Spence got out of his car, and then the leaders {{got caught up in the}} incident.

2500|$|In Newcastle upon Tyne, a {{solicitor}} called William Armstrong, who {{had been}} experimenting with water-powered machines, was working for a firm of solicitors who were appointed to act {{on behalf of the}} Whittle Dene Water Company. [...] The water company had been set up to supply Newcastle with drinking water, and Armstrong was appointed secretary at the first meeting of shareholders. Soon afterwards, he wrote to Newcastle Town Council, suggesting that the cranes on the quay should be converted to hydraulic power. He was required to carry out the work at his own expense, but would be rewarded if the conversion was a success. It was, and he set up the Newcastle Cranage Company, which received an order for the conversion of the other four cranes. Further work followed, with the engineer from Liverpool Docks visiting Newcastle and being impressed by a demonstration of the crane's versatility, given by the <b>crane</b> <b>driver</b> John Thorburn, known locally as [...] "Hydraulic Jack".|$|E

[...] "It's also wrong that their pay is now lower than in 1997 or during SARS," [...] HIT general manager Gerry Yim Lui-fai told the South China Morning Post. Several long-serving stevedores working for Lem Wing Transportation and Everbest dismissed the strikers' claims as exaggeration. A 7-year veteran <b>crane</b> <b>driver</b> said [...] "It's not that we can't go to the toilet or don't have time for a meal... In fact, we have short breaks of two to three minutes between vessels berthing at the terminals. Very rarely can I get 15 to 30 minutes. We also take turns to have meals so that we have around 15 to 20 minutes for mealtimes." [...] He said that he enjoyed a pay increase in 2011. Two Everbest employees said that, by working as a pair and managing their time during a 24-hour shift, they can alternate and work six or twelve hours. They said they took home HK$1,315 and HK$1,441, (between US$170 and $185) per shift, averaging HK$20,000 ($2,560) per month. They also said that some of their colleagues wanted to return to work, but were worried they would be chastised as spineless.|$|E

50|$|An initial {{response}} by workers at mass meetings on 3 January in Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide was {{to refuse to}} work the four hours extra stipulated by the Lukin award. This then precipitated the employers applying to the court that a strike existed. The penalties of the Arbitration Amendment Act, enacted in 1928, were then invoked. The urban nature of timber mills meant that industrial action was concentrated around the working class areas of the affected cities, notably Glebe in Sydney. The dispute widened with carters and <b>crane</b> <b>drivers</b> striking in solidarity. A special conference of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) on 7 February 1929 agreed to extend the strike to a general movement; to boycott the Federal Industrial Court; and {{for the conduct of}} the strike to be managed by the ACTU Disputes Committee.|$|R

40|$|This is a {{paper about}} {{different}} ways of revealing materials, and a theory of organization. It moves through a kaleidoscope of perspectives which reveal the tower crane as made through its relations {{with a series of}} {{different ways of}} seeing – engineering and mathematics, capitalist economics, and a workplace labour process. It employs a wide variety of sources, including some interviews that I have done with <b>crane</b> <b>drivers.</b> I then move into an account of the modernist fascination with technology, particularly Soviet Constructivism. The latter provides the theoretical scaffolding which allows me to see the crane as a temporary stabilisation of structure, and structure as an arrangement of planes and lines of force which allows certain moves just as it prevents others. This is a way of saying that an adequate understanding of ‘organization’ requires thinking multiples and relations. Nodding towards Deleuze and Guattari towards the end, I suggest that cranes are good to think with for these multiple purposes, but that any assemblage would do. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R

40|$|Whole-body {{vibration}} (WBV) is {{the vibration}} transmitted to a person's entire body via {{contact with a}} vibration source, usually through sitting or standing on a vibrating surface. WBV is a common occupational problem for workers in high-vibration environments, particularly when the exposure represents {{a significant part of}} their working day. High-vibration workplaces are numerous and those exposed may include <b>crane</b> operators, tractor <b>drivers,</b> heavy equipment operators, and many kinds of car and truck drivers. Similarly, pilots - particularly helicopter pilots - may be exposed at significant rates. Health effects include, but are not limited to, headache, loss of balance, low back pain, degenerative disorders of the spine, and gastrointestinal diseases. For seated workers, prevention measures include seats and/or cushions that dampen vibrations and ergonomically correct postures. Standing workers should be provided with mechanically isolated flooring. Isolating the source of vibration and limiting exposure time are strategies for all exposed workers...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review was to {{determine}} whether there is support for a causal link between exposure to whole body vibration and back disorders in vehicle operating occupations. The review was completed in three steps. We searched the scientific literature using electronic databases (Medline, EMBASE, NIOSHTIC, Ergoweb, and Arbline) and reference literature, then sorted the literature for relevance and topic. The selected scientific studies were reviewed using standard epidemiological criteria, looking for consistency between studies, strong associations unlikely to be due to chance or confounding, increases in response with increases in exposure, and plausible temporal and biological relationships. Forty epidemiological studies of the association between back disorders and vehicle operation jobs were selected for detailed review. The risk was elevated in a broad range of driving occupations, including truck drivers, earth moving machine operators, power shovel operators, bulldozer operators, forklift <b>drivers,</b> <b>crane</b> operators, straddle carrier operators, agricultural workers, tractor drivers, bus drivers, helicopter pilots, subway operators, reindeer herders, and vehicle drivers not otherwise specified.

40|$|Abstract. Companies {{that provide}} crane-lorry {{services}} {{are faced with}} the daily need to perform vehicle and driver allocation and scheduling. Many companies still do this manually {{due to the lack of}} suitable technologies. This manual approach is both time consuming and inaccurate and most probably will not lead to an optimized plan that can reduce operational costs. In this paper, we describe the design of a system called “Crane Lorry Scheduling System ” (CLSS) that we have developed for the largest crane lorry company in Hong Kong. A crane lorry company is a company that provides lorries with different types of mounted <b>crane</b> equipment and <b>drivers</b> to service different types of moving and lifting jobs. CLSS is a Web-based application that streamlines communication with customers, subcontractors and employees/lorry drivers. We modeled the lorry-assignment problem as a constraint-satisfaction problem (CSP) algorithm, which we call the “Crane Lorry Optimizing Engine ” (CLOE). CLOE was designed to be easily customizable to match the needs and requirements of different crane lorry companies. We experimented with two versions of CLOE, regular CLOE that finds “best ” solutions and X-CLOE that finds “optimal ” solutions. Results from our tests show that CLOE is faster and generates better quality plans than the manual approach...|$|R
