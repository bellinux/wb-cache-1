5|$|Aluminium {{chloride}} {{belongs to}} the point group D3h in its monomeric form and D2h in its dimeric form. Both forms of aluminium chloride, however, do not possess a dipole moment because the bond dipole moments <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|The orbital angular {{momentum}} of electrons is quantized. Because the electron is charged, it produces an orbital magnetic moment that {{is proportional to the}} {{angular momentum}}. The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus. The magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligible compared with that of the electrons. The magnetic moments of the electrons that occupy the same orbital (so called, paired electrons) <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field produced by an atom—its magnetic moment—is determined by these {{various forms of}} angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a {{magnetic field}}. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due {{to the nature of}} electrons to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state, bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out,</b> reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.|$|E

50|$|In accounting, {{the term}} slush fund {{describes}} a general ledger account of commingled funds {{to which all}} manner of transactions can be posted, with debits and credits <b>cancelling</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the House, {{the party}} {{balance of the}} chamber {{remained}} unchanged as Republican and Democratic gains <b>cancelled</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out.</b> In the Senate, the Democrats picked up two seats, increasing their majority.|$|R
5|$|A {{different}} scenario {{occurs when}} the moon is either revolving around the primary faster than the primary rotates, or is revolving in the direction opposite the planet's rotation. In these cases, the tidal bulge lags behind the moon in its orbit. In the former case, the direction of angular momentum transfer is reversed, so {{the rotation of the}} primary speeds up while the satellite's orbit shrinks. In the latter case, the angular momentum of the rotation and revolution have opposite signs, so transfer leads to decreases in the magnitude of each (that <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out).</b> In both cases, tidal deceleration causes the moon to spiral in towards the primary until it either is torn apart by tidal stresses, potentially creating a planetary ring system, or crashes into the planet's surface or atmosphere. Such a fate awaits the moons Phobos of Mars (within 30to50million years), Triton of Neptune (in 3.6 billion years), Metis and Adrastea of Jupiter, and at least 16 small satellites of Uranus and Neptune. Uranus's Desdemona may even collide with one of its neighboring moons.|$|E
5|$|Kirk {{reveals that}} the dinosaurs were brought to their time by an {{experiment}} he was running using his Third Energy technology. A rift in space was created and a pocket of the island from their time was exchanged with the same from the past, bringing dinosaurs back into their time. Kirk then tells them that if the reactors are set to overload, the energy coming from them and the vortex should <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out</b> if they come into contact. After Regina gets the stabilizer and initializer and uses them to overload the reactors, the energy shakes the base, causing a vent to fall on Gail allowing Kirk to get free again. The team heads towards the waterway to escape the blast, but Gail says they still need to capture the doctor. He starts to hobble away on his gun to go after Kirk, and orders Regina and Rick to leave without him {{if he does not}} return in thirty minutes. Regina is given the choice to either go after Dr. Kirk with Gail, or escape with Rick.|$|E
25|$|Two negatives {{within a}} clause <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out,</b> {{with the result}} being a {{positive}} sentence.|$|E
50|$|During {{the period}} between two hours after usual wake-up time and two hours before usual bedtime, light {{exposure}} {{has little or no}} effect on circadian phase (slight effects generally <b>cancelling</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out).</b>|$|R

50|$|Stoke again played away at Midlands opponents {{this time}} Aston Villa {{and both sides}} <b>cancelled</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out</b> in a drab goalless draw. Stoke had Ryan Shotton sent off for two bookable offences.|$|R
25|$|Because swerve and {{deflection}} (for {{very different}} reasons) each cause the cue ball {{to take a}} different path than aimed, but each does so in the opposite direction of the other, under the right conditions swerve and deflection can <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{portion of}} the mass that is located at radii r > r0 exerts no net {{gravitational}} force at the distance r0 from the center. That is, the individual gravitational forces exerted by {{the elements of the}} sphere out there, on the point at r0, <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
25|$|The sense coil (6) is a {{differential}} {{current transformer}} which surrounds (but is not electrically connected to) the live and neutral conductors. In normal operation, all the current down the live conductor returns up the neutral conductor. The currents {{in the two}} conductors are therefore equal and opposite and <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
50|$|Top of {{the table}} Arsenal were next to visit the Potteries on 17 January. Both sides <b>cancelled</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out</b> with both goalkeepers {{producing}} fine performances and the match ended in an entertaining 0-0 draw.|$|R
50|$|Stoke beat last season's record points tally in the Premier League in a {{penultimate}} {{match of}} the season against already relegated Burnley at Turf Moor. Both sides <b>cancelled</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out</b> in an uneventful 0-0 draw.|$|R
40|$|Despite growing aid volumes, {{financing}} {{development is}} becoming more difficult, not less. Better information on private finance flows will help developing-country governments craft more effective policies.

25|$|The coil-rotation {{transformer}} used a fixed-position electromagnet coil {{in conjunction}} with a variable-position coil to vary the voltage in the line by varying the alignment of the two coils. Rotated 90 degrees apart, the secondary coil is affected by two equal but opposite fields from the primary, which effectively <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out</b> and produce no voltage in the secondary.|$|E
25|$|Fermi {{estimates}} generally {{work because}} the estimations {{of the individual}} terms are often close to correct, and overestimates and underestimates help <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out.</b> That is, {{if there is no}} consistent bias, a Fermi calculation that involves the multiplication of several estimated factors (such as the number of piano tuners in Chicago) will probably be more accurate than might be first supposed.|$|E
25|$|In the Earth's atmosphere, {{the chief}} factor {{affecting}} {{the speed of}} sound is the temperature. For a given ideal gas with constant heat capacity and composition, {{the speed of sound}} is dependent solely upon temperature; see Details below. In such an ideal case, the effects of decreased density and decreased pressure of altitude <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out,</b> save for the residual effect of temperature.|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, Clark {{concludes that}} [...] "In {{the minds of}} many statesmen, the hope for a short war and the fear of a long one seemed to have <b>cancelled</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out,</b> holding at bay a fuller {{appreciation}} of the risks." ...|$|R
50|$|When one {{contestant}} won {{the right}} to answer questions he/she selected one of the categories. If a contestant failed to correctly answer as many questions as he/she bid, control passed to the next highest bidder, then the lowest bidder if the second player was unsuccessful. If the two contestants matched bids and <b>canceled</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out,</b> and the remaining contestant failed to fulfill his/her bid, the canceled players were given a chance to re-bid, with the higher bidder having a chance to answer questions from the two remaining categories. If they <b>canceled</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out</b> again, the game moved on to a new set of categories. When a contestant fulfilled the bid, the contestant won the pot.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "advantage/disadvantage" [...] {{mechanic}} was introduced, streamlining conditional {{and situational}} modifiers to a simpler mechanic: rolling two d20s for a situation {{and taking the}} higher of the two for [...] "advantage" [...] and the lower of the two for [...] "disadvantage" [...] and <b>canceling</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out</b> when both apply.|$|R
25|$|Two-slit {{diffraction}} is {{a famous}} {{example of the}} strange behaviors that waves regularly display, that are not intuitively associated with particles. The overlapping waves from the two slits <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out</b> in some locations, and reinforce each other in other locations, causing a complex pattern to emerge. Intuitively, one would not expect this pattern from firing a single particle at the slits, because the particle should pass through one slit or the other, not a complex overlap of both.|$|E
25|$|The {{electronic}} phasing {{effect is}} created by splitting an audio signal into two paths. One path treats the signal with an all-pass filter, which preserves the amplitude of the original signal and alters the phase. The amount of change in phase depends on the frequency. When signals from the two paths are mixed, the frequencies {{that are out of}} phase will <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out,</b> creating the phaser's characteristic notches. Changing the mix ratio changes the depth of the notches; the deepest notches occur when the mix ratio is 50%.|$|E
25|$|A {{problem with}} the {{derivative}} term is that it amplifies higher frequency measurement or process noise that can cause large amounts {{of change in the}} output. It is often helpful to filter the measurements with a low-pass filter in order to remove higher-frequency noise components. As low-pass filtering and derivative control can <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out,</b> the amount of filtering is limited. So low noise instrumentation can be important. A nonlinear median filter may be used, which improves the filtering efficiency and practical performance. In some cases, the differential band can be turned off with little loss of control. This is equivalent to using the PID controller as a PI controller.|$|E
30|$|The decode {{operation}} {{can be used}} {{to extract}} {{some or all of the}} updates, returning the key and the sign of the operation, which is either insert or delete. Since the data structure uses constant space, decoding cannot always succeed. Decoding is a probabilistic operation that is more likely to succeed when the IBF is sparse, which is when the number of encoded operations (excluding the operations that <b>canceled</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out)</b> is small. The decoding process can also be partially successful, if some elements could be extracted but the remaining IBF is non-empty. Extracting an update by decoding an IBF is only possible if the key was recorded only once in the IBF. However, storing a deletion or insertion of the same key twice or more (not counting operations that <b>canceled</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out)</b> makes both updates impossible to decode.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} years, {{the running}} order was not {{decided by the}} drawing of lots, but instead by the producers, {{with the aim of}} making the shows more exciting and ensuring that all contestants had a chance to stand out, preventing entries that are too similar <b>cancelling</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out.</b> The decision elicited mixed reactions from both fans of the contest and participating broadcasters.|$|R
30|$|Table  3 further {{reveals that}} when the {{significant}} indirect effects through inspiration, fascination, gratitude, and envy were combined (see reported total indirect effects), they <b>cancelled</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out,</b> resulting in a nonsignificant overall effect of admiration on well-being. The PWB dimension personal growth was the only exception from this general pattern. Admiration showed a significant total effect of B[*]=[*] 0.16 on personal growth.|$|R
25|$|Conventionally, {{capacitors}} {{are treated}} as if they generate reactive power and inductors as if they consume it. If a capacitor and an inductor are placed in parallel, then the currents flowing through the capacitor and the inductor tend to cancel rather than add. This is the fundamental mechanism for controlling the power factor in electric power transmission; capacitors (or inductors) are inserted in a circuit to partially compensate for reactive power 'consumed' by the load. Purely capacitive circuits supply reactive power with the current waveform leading the voltage waveform by 90degrees, while purely inductive circuits absorb reactive power with the current waveform lagging the voltage waveform by 90degrees. The result {{of this is that}} capacitive and inductive circuit elements tend to <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
25|$|In modern times, more {{sophisticated}} surface coatings have been developed; these include violet-blue dyes and vacuum-sputtered films resembling the magnesium fluoride coating on camera lenses. These coatings effectively whiten the apparent {{color of a}} yellow-tinted diamond, because the two colors are complementary and act to <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out.</b> Usually only applied to the pavilion or girdle region of a diamond, these coatings are among the hardest treatments to detect—while the dyes may be removed in hot water or alcohol with ease, the vacuum-sputtered films require a dip in sulfuric acid to remove. The films can be detected under high magnification {{by the presence of}} raised areas where air bubbles are trapped, and by worn areas where the coating has been scratched off. These treatments are considered fraudulent unless disclosed.|$|E
25|$|Xu, using atomic force microscopy, {{has shown}} that {{formation}} of amyloid fibers is a two-step process in which proteins first aggregate into colloidal spheres of ~20nm diameter. The spheres then join together spontaneously to form linear chains, which evolve into mature amyloid fibers. The formation of these linear chains appears {{to be driven by}} the development of an electrostatic dipole in each of the colloidal spheres strong enough to overcome coulomb repulsion. This suggests a possible mechanism by which alpha sheet may promote amyloid aggregation; the peptide bond has a relatively large intrinsic electrostatic dipole, but normally the dipoles of nearby bonds <b>cancel</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out.</b> In the alpha sheet, unlike other conformations, the peptide bonds are oriented in parallel so that the dipoles of the individual bonds can add up to create a strong overall electrostatic dipole.|$|E
50|$|Another newly {{promoted}} {{side were}} next opponents for Stoke {{in the form}} of Birmingham City at St Andrew's. Stoke suffered an early blow as James Beattie was forced to come off due to injury, meaning that Dave Kitson would have a chance to impress. There were few chances during the match with both sides <b>cancelling</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out</b> and the match finished 0-0.|$|R

30|$|In sum, the {{mediator}} model uncovered that admiration and adoration were unrelated to well-being because these emotions had {{positive and negative}} indirect effects through related emotions on well-being indicators that <b>cancelled</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>out.</b> The resulting total effects on self-acceptance, environmental mastery, and life satisfaction were nonsignificant, while small total effects of admiration on personal growth and of adoration on purpose in life were retained.|$|R
