40|$|As {{outsourcing}} {{and globalization}} {{increase the number}} of supply chain participants, a collaborative product development will enable companies to speed up the decision-making of supply chains of trusted partners, employees, suppliers, and customers. The first phase of new product development is conceptual design. Eighty percent of the product development costs are determined during this phase. Due to continuous changes in design projects, delays in product developments are not rare. Thus, a change control workflow is needed among supply chain participants for product development especially for new product development. A distributed <b>change</b> <b>control</b> <b>process</b> applying the principles of configuration management for conceptual design is therefore proposed. A baseline of inter-document relationship is utilized to maintain the consistence of design documents among supply chain participants. With the proposed distributed <b>change</b> <b>control</b> <b>process,</b> the intervention resources will be reduced and the quality of conceptual designs will be increased...|$|E
40|$|Change {{control is}} crucial in a {{software}} development organ-isation, as changes arrive during all stages of development. Changes that are introduced in the software at the peril of individual developers may affect aspects of the software such as stability, usability, and overall quality. Typically, change proposals are handled in a <b>change</b> <b>control</b> <b>process,</b> where the implications and impact of the change are analysed. In order to support this type of analysis, we have created a checklist-based process support instrument, the purpose {{of which is to}} allow for objective and systematic analyses. We present an approach for adapting generic checklists along three axes: process, domain, and roles, as well as character-istics of the resulting support instrument. We also describe two evaluations of the <b>change</b> <b>control</b> <b>process,</b> of which the latter is designed with the stepwise character of the process in mind. We discuss some preliminary evaluation results, and in the light of these conclude that the use of checklist-based process support seems promising so far. 1...|$|E
40|$|CH 2 M HILL Hanford Group, Inc., has {{expanded}} {{the scope and}} increased the formality of process hazards analyses performed on new or modified Tank Farm facilities, designs, and processes. The CH 2 M HILL process hazard analysis emphasis has been altered to reflect its use as a fundamental part of the engineering and <b>change</b> <b>control</b> <b>process</b> instead of simply being a nuclear safety analysis tool. The scope has been expanded to include identification of accidents/events that impact the environment, or require emergency response, {{in addition to those}} with significant impact to the facility worker, the offsite, and the 100 -meter receptor. Also, there is now an expectation that controls will be identified to address all types of consequences. To ensure that the process has an appropriate level of rigor and formality, a new engineering standard for process hazards analysis was created. This paper discusses the role of process hazards analysis as an information source for not only nuclear safety, but also for the worker-safety management programs, emergency management, environmental programs.

40|$|AbstractThis paper reviews {{studies on}} <b>change</b> <b>control</b> <b>processes</b> in {{construction}} to inform future research. It starts by defining and distinguishing change, variations, change orders, <b>change</b> management <b>processes</b> and <b>control.</b> The review then identifies two streams {{in the existing}} literature: the first empirically describes change order causes and effects on projects, and the second seeks to develop new models for managing change processes. The review is timely as major construction projects, such as Crossrail, are implementing configuration management principles to manage change. While the extant model-building work by researchers provides a useful starting point for further research, this paper argues that there is important work to do, that is less high-level and more empirically grounded, to examine, test and extend established principles of configuration management...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{software}} project encounters {{many changes}} during the software development life cycle. The key {{challenge is to}} control these changes and manage {{their impact on the}} project plan, budget, and implementation schedules. A well-developed <b>change</b> <b>control</b> <b>process</b> should assist the project manager and the responsible team in monitoring these changes. In this paper, we examine a number of approaches for project monitoring & control with different scenarios of project schedules. The comparison shows the effect of applying each approach on the cost and the time of the project. The evaluation illustrates that the integrated software Project and Change Management (IPCM) is a more efficient for providing more control in tracking change requests, and improve the performance monitoring process...|$|E
40|$|Agile {{software}} development methodologies are {{new ways of}} managing {{software development}}, a new answer to the problems inherent in developing software. They attempt to eliminate scope risk by breaking projects down into short cycles, known as iterations.

Being iterative in nature, they represent a complete change to earlier development methods: there is no work breakdown structure, no Gantt chart, no <b>change</b> <b>control</b> <b>process</b> and potentially little documentation. For this reason Agile software development methodologies are very popular with some sections of the software development community who see themselves freed from the drudgery of process to focus purely on coding...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} explore non-verbal {{executive}} processes in simultaneous interpreters. Simultaneous interpreters, bilinguals without any training in simultaneous interpreting and control monolinguals performed the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST, Experiment 1) and the Simon task (Experiment 2). Performance on WCST was thought to index cognitive flexibility while Simon task performance was considered an index of inhibitory processes. Simultaneous interpreters outperformed bilinguals and monolinguals on the WCST by showing reduced number of attempts to infer the rule, few errors and few previous-category perseverations. However, simultaneous interpreters presented Simon effects {{similar to those found}} in bilinguals and monolinguals. Together, these results suggest that experience in interpreting is associated with <b>changes</b> in <b>control</b> <b>processes</b> required to perform interpreting tasks...|$|R

40|$|The TMT Software System {{consists}} of software components that interact {{with one another}} through a software infrastructure called TMT Common Software (CSW). CSW {{consists of}} software services and library code that is used by developers to create the subsystems and components that participate in the software system. CSW also defines the types of components that can be constructed and their roles. The use of common component types and shared middleware services allows standardized software interfaces for the components. A software system called the TMT Interface Database System was constructed to support the documentation of the interfaces for components based on CSW. The programmer describes a subsystem and each of its components using JSON-style text files. A command interface file describes each command a component can receive and any commands a component sends. The event interface files describe status, alarms, and events a component publishes and status and events subscribed to by a component. A web application was created to provide a user interface for the required features. Files are ingested into the software system’s database. The user interface allows browsing subsystem interfaces, publishing versions of subsystem interfaces, and constructing and publishing interface control documents that consist of the intersection of two subsystem interfaces. All published subsystem interfaces and interface control documents are versioned for configuration control and follow the standard TMT <b>change</b> <b>control</b> <b>processes.</b> Subsystem interfaces and interface control documents can be visualized in the browser or exported as PDF files...|$|R
