As part of this project, Stone Church Road was extended west from Upper Horning Road to Golf Links Road.|$|E
5|$|It is {{very common}} {{practice}} for power companies or their customers to impose harmonic distortion limits based on IEC or IEEE standards. For example, IEEE Standard 519 limits at the customer's <b>connection</b> <b>point</b> call for the maximum individual frequency voltage harmonic {{to be no more}} than 3% of the fundamental and call for the voltage total harmonic distortion (THD) to be no more than 5% for a general AC power supply system.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the feasibility of power generation using a pico-hydraulic turbine from sewage flowing in pipes. First, the sewage flow rate at two <b>connection</b> <b>points</b> to the Toyogawa River-Basin Sewerage, Japan, was explored for over a year to elucidate the hydraulic energy potential of the sewage. Second, the performance of the pico-hydraulic turbine was investigated via laboratory experiments that supposed the turbine to be installed in the sewage pipe at the <b>connection</b> <b>points.</b> This study indicates that the <b>connection</b> <b>points</b> have hydraulic potential {{that can be used for}} power generation throughout the year. It also demonstrates that the pico-hydraulic turbine can be usefully employed for power generation from sewage flowing in the pipe at the <b>connection</b> <b>points...</b>|$|R

5|$|As the Turkish forces moved towards Nakhichevan, Andranik {{with his}} Armenian Special Striking Division {{moved to the}} mountainous region of Zangezur {{to set up a}} defense. By mid-1918, the {{relations}} between the Armenians and Azeris in Zangezur had deteriorated. Andranik arrived in Zangezur at a critical moment with around 30,000 refugees and an estimated force of between 3,000 and 5,000 men. He established effective control of the region by September. The role of Zangezur was crucial because it was a <b>connection</b> <b>point</b> between Turkey and Azerbaijan. Under Andranik, the region became one of the last centers of Armenian resistance after the Treaty of Batum.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} spike-like {{crest of}} Saurolophus {{has been interpreted}} in multiple ways, and could have had multiple functions. Brown compared it to {{the crest of a}} chameleon, and suggested it could provide an area for muscle attachment and a <b>connection</b> <b>point</b> for a nonbody back frill like that seen in the basilisk lizard. Peter Dodson interpreted similar features in other duckbills as having use in sexual identification. Maryańska and Osmólska, noting the hollow base, suggested that the crest increased the surface area of the respiratory cavity, and helped in thermoregulation. James Hopson supported a function as a visual signal, and further mentioned the possibility that the inflatable skin flaps over the nostrils could have acted as resonators and additional visual signals. This idea has been picked up by authors of popular dinosaur works, such as David B. Norman, who discussed hadrosaurid display at length and included a life restoration of such an adaptation in action.|$|E

40|$|Thermoelectric {{properties}} of a C 60 molecular transistor are studied using Green function formalism in linear response regime. A tight-binding model {{is used to}} investigate {{the effect of the}} dimerization and coupling geometry on the electrical conductance, thermopower, and figure of merit. Increase of the <b>connection</b> <b>points</b> between the molecule and electrodes results in decrease of the number of the peaks of the electrical conductance owing to the interference effects. In addition, oscillation of the thermopower is reduced by increase of the <b>connection</b> <b>points.</b> It is also observed that the kind of carriers participating in the energy transport is dependent on the coupling geometry. Results show that the increase of the <b>connection</b> <b>points</b> leads to the reduction of the figure of merit. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
25|$|Unsuccessful {{attempts}} were made to connect portable generating equipment to power water pumps. The failure was attributed to flooding at the <b>connection</b> <b>point</b> in the Turbine Hall basement and the absence of suitable cables. TEPCO switched its efforts to installing new lines from the grid. One generator at unit 6 resumed operation on 17 March, while external power returned to units 5 and 6 only on 20 March.|$|E
25|$|A bus {{shuttle service}} was {{scheduled}} to begin in early 2016 from Metro Airport to the transportation hub in downtown Detroit to better connect tourists and business travelers to the city. The airport does not now have a train or direct shuttle to the city. The SMART bus offers a bus service to the city but with multiple connections with a travel time of about an hour to downtown. The shuttle service will take 25 minutes. In addition to existing bus plans, the Regional Transit Authority is planning mass transit from Detroit to a rail <b>connection</b> <b>point</b> {{just north of the}} airport, {{in an effort to make}} transportation quicker and easier.|$|E

25|$|Small wind {{turbines}} {{may be used}} for a variety of applications including on- or off-grid residences, telecom towers, offshore platforms, rural schools and clinics, remote monitoring and other purposes that require energy where there is no electric grid, or where the grid is unstable. Small {{wind turbines}} may be as small as a fifty-watt generator for boat or caravan use. Hybrid solar and wind powered units are increasingly being used for traffic signage, particularly in rural locations, as they avoid the need to lay long cables from the nearest mains <b>connection</b> <b>point.</b> The U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) defines small wind turbines as those smaller than or equal to 100 kilowatts. Small units often have direct drive generators, direct current output, aeroelastic blades, lifetime bearings and use a vane to point into the wind.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1950s, a new bypass (known as the Eastern Bypass) {{was built}} north of Lakeshore Drive from South Main Street to Hopewell. The highway {{became part of}} a rerouted US20 and NY5 by 1956. A {{continuation}} of the bypass (named the Western Bypass) around the southwestern portion of Canandaigua between West Avenue Extension and South Main Street {{was built in the}} late 1970s and opened to traffic as a realignment of US20 and NY5 by 1981. Following its completion, NY21 was realigned onto the bypass between Bristol and South Main Streets. NY21 turned north onto South Main Street, rejoining its previous alignment at Bristol Street. Additionally, NY332 was extended southward from West Avenue to its present southern terminus at the Western/Eastern Bypass <b>connection</b> <b>point,</b> prolonging the already-existing overlap with NY21 in the process. The former routing of US20/ NY5 on South Main Street south of NY332 remains state maintained as unsigned NY942T.|$|E
500|$|Traveling {{southbound}} on NY590, {{two significant}} movements are restricted {{due to the}} composition of the expressway. One is at Blossom Road in Brighton, where traffic entering NY590 southbound cannot access I-490 due to the location of the exit5 (left exit) flyover, which begins north of the Blossom Road onramp. This movement was possible prior to the reconstruction of the Can of Worms, as the original <b>connection</b> <b>point</b> between the Sea Breeze Expressway and I-490 was south of the Blossom Road interchange. In Irondequoit, there are no southbound exits between East Ridge Road and NY404; thus, there is no access to either NY104 or Norton Street. [...] An access road between NY590 at Titus Avenue and the Irondequoit Bay Bridge was planned to provide access from NY590 southbound to NY104 eastbound and from NY104 westbound to NY590 northbound, but it was never completed.|$|E

2500|$|An affine {{connection}} on a manifold M is {{a connection}} (principal bundle) on the frame bundle of M (or equivalently, a connection (vector bundle) on the tangent bundle of M).
