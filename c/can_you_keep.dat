500|$|In an on-set {{interview}} with The Huffington Post, actor John Noble {{explained that the}} episode's primary storyline concerned the bridge between the two worlds. The third season finale, he explained, ended with the two universes healing themselves {{with the help of}} a [...] "bridge". He remarked, [...] "What happens if that bridge now begins to be used as a conduit for evil? That’s the issue we’re facing. What do you do? What do you do with this wonderful discovery? Do you keep it? What do you lose if you lose it? For example, if we didn’t have that , we... wouldn’t have all these wonderful characters that we’ve grown to love. What would happen? I think we have to face that issue. We have to face the issue of 'How long <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> this alive, this link between interlacing the two universes?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Dolly Singh {{is played}} by Sheena Bajaj. Her {{character}} {{is the equivalent of}} the Good Luck Charlie character Teddy Duncan, who {{is played by}} Bridgit Mendler. She is Nikki's only sister, and the second-oldest child in the Singh family. Sensing that she will not be around as much when Nikki is grown, she produces and directs video diaries for her, giving advice she hopes will help Nikki be successful as a teenager. She produces these video diaries {{at the end of every}} episode and ends them by saying, [...] "Best of Luck, Nikki." [...] Her best friend is Pam. Throughout the show, Dolly has had numerous boyfriends. She dated Ritesh (Shaheer Sheikh) in season one, but they broke up after she caught him two-timing both her and a pretty, dim-witted brunette named Maya. She and Maya later become friends. She dates Rahul in season two, with the two of them getting together in the episode <b>Can</b> <b>You</b> <b>Keep</b> A Secret? Dolly is often shown caring for her brothers, such as saving Rohan from falling out of the treehouse window, or offering to help Sunny deal with Guri, who has given him a black eye.|$|E

2500|$|Rohan Singh {{is played}} by Murtuza Kutianawala. He is the eldest Singh sibling. He and Dolly often fight, {{although}} they care about each other, and he usually gets along well with his younger brother, Sunny. He often appears awkward, somewhat careless, and childish, but on numerous occasions {{has been known to}} be resourceful, creative, and intelligent. He has also been shown to be a good cook, and Avatar once tricked Himani (who isn't a very good cook) into working later so that Rohan would cook. He and his best friend Popi have their own band. Rohan occasionally uses his younger sister Nikki for his personal gain, like when he uses her to make big tips while working for Kukkad Nukkad by saying that his mother was in the hospital when she actually worked there (customers just assumed she was ill). He dated Dolly's friend Maya, who like him is a scatterbrain, but they broke up in Rohan in the City, when Maya had to move to Mumbai because of her father's new job. He was originally intended to be named Rohan Singh, but Avatar was nervous as he was writing on his birth certificate, resulting in the legal name of [...] "Rohini Singh". Despite Avatar trying to correct this in the season two episode <b>Can</b> <b>You</b> <b>Keep</b> a Secret?, he accidentally changed the intended name to [...] "Rona Ping". In season three, Rohan moves into an apartment shared with Popi, but is still in the Singh house a lot. In Good Luck Charlie, Rohan is the equivalent of PJ Duncan who {{is played by}} Jason Dolley.|$|E
