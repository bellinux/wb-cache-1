The development of independent living and personal skills is also encouraged. The college is divided into several different areas of study. These include Leisure, Therapies and Sport (including courses and qualifications in massage, complementary therapies, and sport treatment and management); Music, Media, Performance and Art (including courses and qualifications in music technology, media and art); Information and Communication Technology (including courses and qualifications in office skills and the European Computer Driving Licence); Business, Administration and Customer Service; Secondary level qualifications– General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) and General Certificate of Education Advanced Level (A-Level) qualifications in subjects such as English, mathematics, French and psychology; and Braille reading. On top of academic and vocational study students are also taught to develop independence and mobility skills for day-to-day living. Topics covered here {{include the use of}} a white cane and becoming familiar with the surrounding environment, using public transport safely and confidently, cooking and laundry skills, and using cash machines or making <b>Chip</b> <b>and</b> <b>PIN</b> credit card transactions.|$|E

In order for the cleaning card to work properly in the device, the card resembles or mimics the material of the transaction media - such as a credit card, check, or currency. As the cleaning card is inserted and passed through the device, it will clean components that would normally {{come in contact with}} the transaction media such as readers, lenses, read/write <b>chip</b> <b>and</b> <b>pins,</b> belts, rollers, <b>and</b> paths. Cleaning card products are widely accepted and endorsed by device manufacturers and industry professionals. Many have developed their own cleaning cards to better clean their particular devices.|$|R

25|$|A similar {{system of}} {{controls}} {{can be used}} on physical cards. Technology provides the option for banks to support many other controls too that can be turned on and off and varied by the credit card owner in real time as circumstances change (i.e., they can change temporal, numerical, geographical and many other parameters on their primary and subsidiary cards). Apart from the obvious benefits of such controls: from a security perspective this means that a customer can have a <b>Chip</b> <b>and</b> <b>PIN</b> card secured for the real world, and limited for use in the home country. In this eventuality a thief stealing the details will be prevented from using these overseas in non <b>chip</b> <b>and</b> <b>pin</b> EMV countries. Similarly the real card can be restricted from use on-line so that stolen details will be declined if this tried. Then when card users shop online they can use virtual account numbers. In both circumstances an alert system can be built in notifying a user that a fraudulent attempt has been made which breaches their parameters, and can provide data on this in real time.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{verification}} systems allow merchants {{to verify}} {{in a few}} seconds that the card is valid and the cardholder has sufficient credit to cover the purchase, allowing the verification to happen at time of purchase. The verification is performed using a credit card payment terminal or point-of-sale (POS) system with a communications link to the merchant's acquiring bank. Data from the card is obtained from a magnetic stripe or chip on the card; the latter system is called <b>Chip</b> <b>and</b> <b>PIN</b> in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and is implemented as an EMV card.|$|E

The significantly increased performance over the 8086 was primarily due to the non-multiplexed address and data buses, more address-calculation hardware (most importantly, a dedicated adder) and a faster (more hardware-based) multiplier.

40|$|AbstractIn {{semiconductor}} packaging industry, thin metal bonding wires, such as {{gold and}} copper, in the diameter range of 18 to 25 microns, {{are commonly used}} to connect between IC <b>chip</b> <b>and</b> connector <b>pins</b> through thermosonic <b>and</b> ultrasonic welding (bonding) in various types of packages. Copper bonding wire posts great challenges to industry users {{when they need to}} bond it onto IC bond pad of sensitive construction underneath. Any hard impact due to the material property, i. e. hardness, or excess ultrasonic parameter setting in the bonding process can easily cause the pad to crack. It is therefore of interest to the users on how hard the copper wire is and most importantly, the subsequent solidified molten ball as a result of melting the tip of the wire in the process. A Vickers micro-indentation hardness tester with minimum load of 0. 5 gmf (5 mN) capability is used to measure the hardness of copper wire along its length and in the free air ball (FAB). To determine the suitable load to be used to measure hardness of such fine diameter and minimize variation in the measured results due to different sample preparation effects, a range of load from 1 gmf to less than 50 gmf was studied...|$|R

40|$|Miniaturized, dense {{integration}} and high operating frequencies of FPGAs are {{factors contributing to}} electromagnetic emissions.

This paper presents an alternative approach to measure electromagnetic emissions by locating the entire FPGA test board inside the GTEM cell instead of mounting it at the wall of the cell. Before measurements, the FPGA board is properly shielded with metallic enclosure to avoid unintentional contribution from supporting components on the board. During measurements, the shielded FPGA board is arranged in horizontal or vertical positions and for each position the FPGA chip is configured with two different logic circuits.

When the thermal management, control of ground bounce, and power distribution issues are considered, achieving the required reliability levels for space applications with traditional interconnect technologies is becoming more of a concern. As an alternative solution, an ultrawideband (UWB) based high speed wireless method for chip to chip as well as off-board communications can be considered.

5000|$|Early {{processors}} used a wire {{for each}} {{bit of the}} address width. For example, a 16-bit address bus had 16 physical wires making up the bus. As the buses became wider and lengthier, this approach became expensive {{in terms of the}} number of <b>chip</b> <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> board traces. Beginning with the Mostek 4096 DRAM, address multiplexing implemented with multiplexers became common. In a multiplexed address scheme, the address is sent in two equal parts on alternate bus cycles. This halves the number of address bus signals required to connect to the memory. For example, a 32-bit address bus can be implemented by using 16 lines and sending the first half of the memory address, immediately followed by the second half memory address ...|$|R
