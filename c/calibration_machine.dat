40|$|Abstract: Three new force {{calibration}} machines {{covering the}} range from 1 kN to 1 MN {{has been designed}} and constructed at DM-SIC in Bogotá, Columbia. The 1 MN force <b>calibration</b> <b>machine</b> (fcm) is a reference force <b>calibration</b> <b>machine</b> of new design. A special flexible sealed twin piston cylinder system with rotating cylinders {{has been used for}} the generation of hydraulic forces to reduce the friction, oil losses and pressure drops in the hydraulic system. Time optimization and a high accuracy of force control could be achieved by a three-step combination of rapid preliminary positioning, a PI controller algorithm and, finally, a change-over to PID controller characteristics. The relative deviations between the measurements carried out at PTB and the final measurements performed in the 1 MN reference force <b>calibration</b> <b>machine</b> show that the fcm fulfils the predetermined overall specifications limits of relative uncertainty < 2 ⋅ 10 - 4 in the whole working range from 40 kN to 1 MN...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{accuracy of}} force transducers and their calibration had two major effects: {{the chance to}} better extract the capability of a reference standard machine (compared to a formerly mixed evaluation of machine plus transducer) {{and on the other}} hand the need to build up reference standard machines capable to calibrate those high precision transducers. Using the experience of designing force transducers, of constructing <b>calibration</b> <b>machines</b> and of calibrating force within the German Calibration Service (DKD) since 1977 HBM decided to take the challenge.

40|$|Calibration {{machines}} up to a {{torque range}} of 20 kN·m need extensive design if the force is performed by dead weights. A machine {{based on two}} force reference standards and a vertical torque axis may serve to avoid these specific problems. The precision force transducers work at a lever arm of precision length. The test piece is mounted in vertical arrangement between a hydraulically operating rotary-actuator and the torque measuring system. Such a <b>calibration</b> <b>machine</b> allows additionally performing easily continuous calibration. Regarding an overall relative uncertainty not greater than 2 · 10 - 4 there are some significant problems.

40|$|Abstract — Calibration is the {{procedure}} of quantifying mechanical deficiencies of machines and compensating them by appropriate adjustment. This paper introduces a modelbased measurement framework for improving calibration procedures of machine tools. The {{goal is to}} precisely estimate the mechanical deficiencies based on a minimal number of measurements. For that purpose, the mechanical deficiencies of linear and rotary joints are modeled using splines. Uncertainties of the deficiency model are formulated stochastically, which allows incorporation of imprecise measurement data and prediction of optimal measurement parameters. We derive a method for optimally estimating a set of splines, i. e., joint errors, based {{on a set of}} measurements and for predicting the optimal joint configuration for new measurements.

In order to perform a girth weld of such pipes, the clad layers of both parts must geometrically fit to each other.
