After that, the user <b>configures</b> the “problem”, <b>command</b> {{with a set of}} parameters. The definition of the problem corresponds to the definition of the algorithms parameters: population size, maximum number of evaluations, size of the external file, crossover and mutation rates. To adjust such parameters and to ease the use of the approach in practice, we recommend the use of default parameters found in the literature. This recommendation is supported by studies in the software testing domain, reported in (Arcuri and Fraser 2011), which analyze the effects of a tuning and shows that the use of default parameters is reasonable and a justified choice. The user also needs to chose the objectives {{to be used in the}} evolution process. In the next subsections we present examples that consider two and three objectives.|$|R
30|$|Mainly, {{for this}} experiment, the {{transponder}} mode was used. In this mode, a link start <b>command</b> <b>configures</b> the instrument {{to wait for}} a maximum of 1  s for a laser pulse from the ground. If a signal that exceeds the threshold level is detected by the receiving telescope, the signal will trigger laser emission of 15  mJ. Two laser pulses can be detected during the 1 -s waiting period, which provide pulse interval measurements. After a command is given to fetch data from the LIDAR, these measurements are sent to the ground via microwave link. As a result, it takes 2  s to acquire one set of data. To determine whether uplink pulses were detected, it was necessary to use first and second detection flags because receiving intensity data were not available. The LIDAR must be in range mode to determine the detection level. Further explanation of the observational modes is given in “Appendix 1 : Observational modes of LIDAR”.|$|R
40|$|A {{key issue}} when making spaces smart is the {{availability}} of satisfying and personalized interaction methods, for the user to comfortably manage the physical and virtual resources in the environment. Among the multiple interaction approaches that are nowadays being explored with this objective, gesture-based ones {{seem to have a}} great potential. In this line, this research describes a gesture-based interaction method that uses a specific grammar to control and network objects in a smart space. The method’s grammar establishes that the user has to identify the object to interact with by performing an individuation gesture primitive (the object’s initial letter), then using an action gesture primitive to indicate the action to perform. The action may involve a second object, which will be identified as the first one. The user will be able to personalize the action gestures in the vocabulary, and to <b>configure</b> the <b>commands</b> assigned to gestures, and the system will provide interaction cues for the user not to feel lost. The main component of the system is a gesture recognition module based on an adapted Dynamic Time Warping algorithm. This module works sharply on acceleration or position data inputs, being suitable to deploy device instrumented or infrastructure-based solutions for gesture recognition (i. e. smartphone or Kinect-based ones). The average recognition rate is 93. 63 % for smartphone-based recognition and 98. 64 % for Kinect-based one, respectively. The paper also details the architecture and software tools that enables the interaction method to work in a real environment...|$|R
30|$|However, in the {{transponder}} mode, a link start <b>command</b> <b>configures</b> {{the instrument}} {{to wait for}} a maximum of 1  s for a laser pulse from the ground. If a signal over the threshold level is detected by the receiving telescope, the signal triggers laser emission of 15  mJ. Up to two laser pulses can be detected during the 1 -s waiting period, and these pulses are flagged as the first and second pulse detection (the names of these telemetry data are STOP 1 and STOP 2). The interval between the first pulse and the laser diode trigger time (STOP 1 TIMING), the interval between the laser diode trigger time to the laser emission (START TIMING), and the interval between two received pulses (STOP 2 TIMING) are also recorded as telemetry data. If a laser pulse from the LIDAR can be detected on the ground, a two-way range is measured by subtracting the internal delay in the instrument, expressed as STOP 1 TIMING + START TIMING. In the transponder mode, the intensities of the transmitting and receiving laser pulses are not available.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays Cisco routers {{are mainly}} <b>configured</b> with CLI (<b>Command</b> Line Interface). However, Cisco offers some GUI (Graphical User Interface) {{management}} tools like SDM (Security Device Manager) and CNA (Cisco Network Assistant). Although {{these are not}} widely used at this time, {{it tends to be}} familiar by all network managers, especially for the use of SDM, which is introduced in great details on CCNP and CCNA Security courses. SDM is a Web-based device-management tool for Cisco routers that can improve the productivity of network managers, simplify router deployments, and help troubleshoot complex network and VPN connectivity issues. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a computer network that uses a public telecommunication infrastructure such as the Internet to provide remote offices or individual users with secure access to their organization's network. Its aim is to avoid an expensive system of leased lines that can be used by only one organization. The aim of my study is to get familiar with the GUI tool SDM and try to use it to establish a Virtual Private Network. Finally, I compared the difference between SDM and the original configuration by command line interface and gave my recommendation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This {{work-in-progress}} paper {{reports on}} our ef-forts to improve {{different aspects of}} coordination in complex, component-based robotic systems. Coordination is a system level aspect concerned with <b>commanding,</b> <b>configuring</b> and monitoring functional computations such that {{the system as a}} whole behaves as desired. To that end a variety of models such as Petri-nets or Finite State Machines may be utilized. These models specify actions to be executed, such as invoking operations or configuring components to achieve a certain goal. This traditional approach has several disadvantages related to loss of reusability of coordination models due to coupling with platform-specific functionality, non-deterministic tempo-ral behavior and limited robustness as a result of executing platform operations {{within the context of the}} coordinator. To avoid these shortcomings, we propose to split this “rich” coordinator into a Pure Coordinator and a Configurator. Al-though the coordinator remains in charge of commanding and reacting, the execution of actions is deferred to the Configurator. This pattern, called Coordinator–Configurator, is implemented as a novel Configurator domain specific language that can be used together with any model of coordination. We illustrate the approach by refactoring an existing application that realizes a safe haptic coupling of two youBot mobile manipulators. I...|$|R

50|$|There {{is basic}} but {{production}} quality support in Windows XP for IPv6 and Teredo tunneling through the Advanced Networking Pack later incorporated into Windows XP SP2. IPv6 {{has to be}} installed and <b>configured</b> from the <b>command</b> line using the netsh interface ipv6 context {{as there is no}} GUI support. After the network interface's link-local address is assigned, stateless autoconfiguration for local and global addresses can be performed by Windows XP. Static IPv6 addresses can be assigned if there is no IPv6 router on the local link. Transition mechanisms such as manually configured tunnels and 6to4 can be set up. Windows Firewall beginning with Windows XP SP2 also supports IPv6 stateful filtering. Applications and tools such as the Telnet client, FTP client, ping, nslookup, tracert, DNS resolver, file and print sharing, Internet Explorer, IIS have been updated to support IPv6. Privacy extensions are enabled and used by default. 6to4 is automatically activated for public IPv4 addresses without a global IPv6 address. Other types of tunnels can be set up include: 6over4, Teredo, ISATAP, PortProxy. Teredo also helps traverse cone and restricted NATs. Teredo host-specific relay is enabled when a global IPv6 address has been assigned, otherwise Teredo client functionality is enabled.|$|R

Hassayampa returned to Pearl Harbor on 17 August to continue shipyard availability. Three weeks later, Hassayampa received orders to return to Pago Pago to again refuel the MSC ships due to repeated delays of the French testing and the MSC vessels running low on fuel as a result. On 6 September 1973, Hassayampa proceeded at 19 kn to accomplish this, meeting up with Corpus Christi Bay, underway, and began {{what turned out to}} be a 42-hour UNREP. Corpus Christi Bay had no alongside UNREP capability so Hassayampa streamed a 2.5 in hose to Corpus Christi Bay as she maintained her station astern, rather than alongside. Seven Hassayampa crewmen were heloed over to help secure and operate the refueling station. Both vessels steamed at bare steerage way (3 - 5 kn). Hassayampa returned to Pearl Harbor on 24 September 1973 and was nominated for a National Defense Transportation Unit Award.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the presented research is to design, fabricate, fully characterize, and assess the usability and functionality of a novel wireless tongue-operated assistive technology, called Tongue Drive System (TDS), that allows individuals with severe physical disabilities (such as quadriplegics) to effectively access computers, drive powered wheelchairs, and control environments using their voluntary tongue motion. The system can wirelessly detect users' tongue movements using an array of magnetic sensors, and a magnetic tracer secured on the tongue, and translate them into a set of user-defined commands in real time, which can then be used to communicate with target devices in users' environment. The principal advantage of the TDS is {{that a combination of}} magnetic sensors and a small permanent magnet can capture a large number of tongue movements, each of which can represent one specific command. A set of dedicated tongue movements can be <b>configured</b> as specific <b>commands</b> for each individual user based on his/her preferences, lifestyle, and remaining abilities. As a result, this technology can benefit a wide range of potential users with different types of disabilities. The work carried out in this dissertation is largely split into three portions: (1) Development, fabrication and characterization of external TDS (eTDS) prototypes to verify the concept of TDS that is detecting and extracting user's intention through their voluntary tongue motion, utilizing a combination of magnetic sensors and a small magnet, as well as the application of this idea in the context of assistive technology. This part of the work is presented in Chapters IV, V and VI. (2) Assessment of the TDS performance in medium term usage for both computer access and wheelchair control. The main purpose of this work was to gain valuable insight into the TDS learning process and its current limiting factors, which could lead the way in designing new generations of TDS with improved usability. This portion of the work is described in Chapter VII. (3) Development and performance assessment of a multimodal TDS (mTDS), that operates based on the information collected from two independent input channels: the tongue motion and speech. This multimodal system expands the access beyond one input channel and therefore improves the speed of access by increasing the information transfer bandwidth between users and computers. This part of the work is presented in Chapters VIII and IX. This dissertation has contributed to the innovation and advancement of the start-of-the-art assistive technology research by exploring, realizing and validating the use of tongue motion as a voluntary motor output to substitute some of the lost arm and hand functions in people with severe disabilities for computer access, wheelchair navigation, and environmental control.
