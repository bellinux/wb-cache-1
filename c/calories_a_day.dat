Description of the proposal Whole wheat products have been gaining popularity as a result of awareness and trends in fitness which has increased the demand and consumption of these types of products (Kapsak, W.

Over the past 20 years, more than a dozen governmental, non-profit health, industrial and trade groups have encouraged the increase of wholegrain consumption (Slavin et al., 2001 and 2004).

The region's trade flows had been thoroughly disrupted; millions were in refugee camps living on aid from United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and other agencies. Food shortages were severe, especially in the harsh winter of 1946–47. From July 1945 through June 1946, the United States shipped 16.5 million tons of food, primarily wheat, to Europe and Japan.

This imbalance occurs when servicemembers fail to consume full portions of their rations. Although manipulations to the food items and distribution of macronutrients to help boost the amount of kilocalories per MRE have been made, more studies are showing many servicemembers still do not meet today's standards of daily consumption, often trading and discarding portions of the ration. Researchers continue to study the habits and eating preferences of servicemembers, making constant changes that encourage servicemembers to eat the entire meal and thus get full nutritional value.|$|E
