50|$|While {{there is}} a modest {{increase}} in compression performance of JPEG 2000 compared to JPEG, the main advantage offered by JPEG 2000 is the significant flexibility of the <b>codestream.</b> The <b>codestream</b> obtained after compression of an image with JPEG 2000 is scalable in nature, meaning {{that it can be}} decoded in a number of ways; for instance, by truncating the <b>codestream</b> at any point, one may obtain a representation of the image at a lower resolution, or signal-to-noise ratio - see scalable compression. By ordering the <b>codestream</b> in various ways, applications can achieve significant performance increases. However, as a consequence of this flexibility, JPEG 2000 requires encoders/decoders that are complex and computationally demanding. Another difference, in comparison with JPEG, is in terms of visual artifacts: JPEG 2000 only produces ringing artifacts, manifested as blur and rings near edges in the image, while JPEG produces both ringing artifacts and 'blocking' artifacts, due to its 8×8 blocks.|$|E

In {{order to improve}} the security level we introduce the permutation of codeblocks contributing in the selected precincts. The idea of combining permutation and selective encryption is used {{in order to minimize}} the amount of processed data encryption while ensuring the best possible degradation through the permutation. Many of proposals format compliant encryption schemes for JPEG 2000 that have been made encrypt packet body data, but leave header packet in plaintext.

40|$|Wireless imaging {{services}} suffer large impairments due to {{the hostile}} nature of the wireless channel. Given the limited and expensive channel bandwidth and the high data demanding nature of these services, it becomes a challenging task to provide high quality of service in such error prone channels. Clearly, suitable error protection is {{necessary in order to}} maintain sufficient quality of these services under various channel conditions. In this report, therefore, we have investigated different channel error protection schemes {{for a wide range of}} channel conditions and coding rates. Two unequal error protection (UEP) schemes have been examined for JPEG 2000 images exploiting useful features of the JPEG 2000 <b>codestream</b> and using the error protection tool set provided by wireless JPEG 2000 (JPWL). Taking the importance of the initial <b>codestream</b> packets on the reconstruction of the image at the receiver into account, the first scheme uses all the additional bandwidth resources in protecting the initial packets of the <b>codestream.</b> The rest of the packets, which are of relatively low importance, are transmitted without any parity symbols assigned to them. In the second UEP scheme, the initial parts of the <b>codestream</b> are strongly protected by assigning them an increased amount of parity symbols. In addition, the tail packets of the <b>codestream</b> are also protected but using a weaker error control code compared to the initial packets. The performance of the proposed UEP schemes has been investigated in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio as a typical fidelity metric and three perceptual quality metrics, namely, the Lp-norm, the structural similarity index, and the visual information fidelity criterion. Numerical results of the proposed UEP schemes have been compared with conventional equal error protection (EEP) over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel as well as Rayleigh fading channel in the presence of AWGN. The results reveal the superior performance of the suggested UEP schemes compared to EEP over a range of channel signal-to-noise ratios and code rates. Reviewed by Benny Lövströ...|$|E

Contrasting to this approach, when focusing onto robust authentication, {{it turns out to}} be difficult to insert the hash value directly into the <b>codestream</b> itself (e.g., after termination markers), since, in any operation which involves decoding and recompression, the original hash value would be lost.
