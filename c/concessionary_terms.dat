50|$|Lending OperationsBADEA {{interventions}} included various {{products that}} have been enhanced and diversified to meet the economic needs of beneficiary countries. They have been steadily promoted to fit the development mechanisms and their conducive atmosphere. These products could be categorized as follows :1. Financing development projects: It {{is the most important}} product in term of volume. Loans to finance projects are extended in <b>concessionary</b> <b>terms,</b> that some projects are financed with a grant element exceeding 50%.2. Financing technical assistance operations: They are extended as grants to finance feasibility studies for development projects and institutional support operations.3. Financing Arab exports to African countries: A program launched in 1983.4. Promote Arab investments in African countries: BADEA has adopted several methods in this regard.5. Debt relief on Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) : 28 countries have benefited from this initiative.6. Financing Urgent Aid : A limited activity which was extended to Sahelian countries that faced drought in 1987.|$|E
50|$|Feb 2012: American {{releases}} its Term Sheets {{detailing the}} concessions it will seek from labor under Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code. Section 1113 allows for bankrupt companies to void their labor contracts and impose new concessionary agreements {{with only the}} approval of the Judge necessary. Typically, the threat of imposed draconian contracts motivates unions to achieve mutual agreements on <b>concessionary</b> contracts. The <b>term</b> sheet American executives offers APFA include dramatic cuts to wages, benefits, and work rules, and the loss of hundreds of flight attendant jobs.|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the bus market and industry in Wales since deregulation in the mid- 1980 s is reviewed. After {{a brief period of}} competition, which seemed to offer the prospect of welfare gains, the industry rapidly consolidated, with resulting losses in bus usage and welfare, similar to the rest of Great Britain outside London. There were large increases in subsidy following the introduction of a national free concessionary fares scheme in 2002. There is some evidence that some of this subsidy has leaked, {{at least some of the}} time, into super-normal profits, in part due to generous <b>concessionary</b> fare reimbursement <b>terms.</b> For the urban parts of Wales, particularly in the North East (centred on Wrexham) and the South East (centred on Cardiff), there are aspirations to develop Bus Rapid Transit to supplement the existing rail network. For rural Wales, there have been long standing aspirations to develop more flexible public transport services and long distance bus services, but this has often been thwarted by lack of funding. Organisational reforms that might assist the Welsh Government in delivering these aspirations are reviewed, including Quality Contracts, Quality Partnerships and Community Partnerships...|$|R
40|$|The chapter {{investigates the}} role of the oil majors (the so called "seven sisters") in the events leading to the 1973 crisis. The basic {{assumption}} is that 1973 was the outcome of a process set in motion some years earlier. The 1969 Libyan military coup could be identified as the starting date of a triangular dialectic which involved oilcompanies, producing and consumer countries, that resulted in the demise of the Western oil companies' absolute control on Mideastern crude and drastically increased the price. In this critical phase the companies were in direct charge of the negotiations with the producing countries. Our narrative concentrates on the events between Summer 1970, when the new Libyan governmentdemanded a revision of the <b>concessionary</b> <b>terms,</b> and February 1971, when a group of thirteen companies and the Persian Gulf producer governments signed in Tehran an agreement on new prices. We attempt, in this chapter, to go a step further, relative to the existing literature, and to investigate these negotiations in the light of some of the available primary sources...|$|E
40|$|This study {{tries to}} explore the {{financing}} opportunity for smallholder cocoa farmers available at capital markets through enterprise growth market (EGM) financing window. The research findings from 122 cocoa farmers revealed that, in average a single cocoa farmer needed Tshs. 551, 808. 12 per acre as capital investment in a given season. At the time of data collection the cocoa prices at London and New York futures markets were Tshs. 6, 266. 75 /Kg and Tshs. 6, 148. 62 /Kg respectively at prevailed rates which were far above the production cost. In this case the envisaged gross margin was sufficient to service issuers’ interest of running their business lucratively and collectors’ interests of getting their investment needs met. The study considered the <b>concessionary</b> <b>terms</b> and conditions on EGM for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to fit cocoa sector in the financial arrangement. Cocoa farmers could raise needed capital for cocoa businesses from the public who would later become shareholders to such businesses. With Bank of Tanzania (BOT) being the guarantor, the findings concluded that the financing arrangement was viable since the interests of issuers and collectors were protected. Capital markets financing could now become an alternative best solution for finance to smallholder farmers following poor accessibility of the same from existing sources especially financial institutions...|$|E
40|$|The {{most part}} of {{stimulation}} methods in Russia {{are concentrated in}} legal documents of the regions of the Russian Federation. They directed on intensification of investment activity in regions. How similar are these investment stimulation conceptions? There is no mention {{in the literature of}} the methodical questions of quantitative analysis and inter-regional comparisons. In addition, there are no results of statistical research of inter-regional correlations of stimulation methods and analysis of dynamics of this process. There are no special measuring instruments. The presented work is aimed at completion of these blanks. The approach for the spatial correlation analysis of legislative norms is offered in research. Classification of investments’ stimulation methods is developed. The way of preparing and coding data for research is offered. The approach and system of coefficients for the analysis of inter-regional interrelations of legislative systems of investments’ stimulation is offered. A proximity coefficient of regional legislation, a factor of structure similarity and a dynamic coincidence index are proposed. The space-time base of investment stimulation methods on Russian Federation regions for 12 years is collected and statistically processed for research. There are only 758 documents. A source of texts is a site of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation. Research of documents has allowed revealing a number of laws in formation of regional investment stimulation systems. The regions that are the most similar in terms of structure of stimulation methods are identified. We have found the group of regions for which it is observed the increase in similarity of the legislation and the group with the reduction of similarity. Therefore, {{it is obvious that the}} general trend to reduction of similarity in the legislation takes place between Krasnoyarsk territory and the other regions of the Russian Federation. Calculations have revealed concurrence of dynamics to use some stimulation methods in Krasnoyarsk region and in the other regions of the Russian Federation for 2005 - 2016. Among them, there are some measures of subsidizing, <b>concessionary</b> <b>terms</b> of using the ground and granting of the ground areas, concession agreements on property and creation of industrial parks, state-private partnership and others. We have found the groups of regions in which there are the trends on harmonization or on a divergence to use the separate kinds of stimulation. Thus, the offered approach and a set of measuring instruments enable to carry out the research of inter-regional similarity of legal documents. It allows receiving the answer to a question on a degree of similarity of systems of investment activity stimulation, accepted in regions; to estimate joint dynamics of stimulation systems’ changes; to define a degree of concurrence on separate measures of support; to analyze similarity of a current condition and processes on the change of the legislation. The approach permits to investigate directions of harmonization or a divergence of regional approaches to investment activity stimulation. The received results can form a base for the further economic-statistical and econometric researches of efficiency of methods for the investment activity stimulation. It will allow to structure objects of research, to allocate more homogeneous group of regions on stimulation methods. The proximity coefficient matrix will be especially useful in spatial econometric models. The offered approach and parameters can be applied to research the other positions of the regional legislation. </p...|$|E
