The <b>chromatoid</b> <b>body</b> is crucial for spermatogenesis but its exact role in the process is not known.

Dicer and components of microRNP complexes (including Ago proteins and microRNAs) are highly concentrated in chromatoid bodies. Furthermore, we show that Dicer interacts with a germ cell-specific <b>chromatoid</b> <b>body</b> component, the RNA helicase MVH (mouse VASA homolog). Thus, chromatoid bodies seem to operate as intracellular nerve centers of the microRNA pathway.

40|$|AbstractPlanarians {{are known}} for their strong {{regenerative}} ability. This ability has been considered to reside in the totipotent somatic stem cell called the “neoblast. ” Neoblasts contain a unique cytoplasmic structure called the “chromatoid body,” which has similar characteristics to the germline granules of germline cells of other animals. The chromatoid bodies decrease in number and size during cytodifferentiation and disappear in completely differentiated cells during regeneration. However, germ cells maintain the <b>chromatoid</b> <b>body</b> during their differentiation from neoblasts. These observations suggest that the <b>chromatoid</b> <b>body</b> is concerned with the totipotency of cells. To understand the molecular nature of the <b>chromatoid</b> <b>body</b> in the neoblast, we focused onvasa(vas) -related genes, since VAS and VAS-related proteins are known to be components of the germline granules inDrosophilaandCaenorhabditis elegans. By PCR, twovas-related genes (Dugesia japonica vasa-like gene, DjvlgAandDjvlgB) were isolated, and they were shown to be expressed in germ cells. Interestingly,DjvlgAwas also expressed in a number of somatic cells in the mesenchymal space. In regenerating planarians, accumulation ofDjvlgA-expressing cells was observed in both the blastema and the blastema–proximal region. In X-ray-irradiated planarians, which had lost regenerative capacity, the number ofDjvlgA-expressing cells decreased drastically. These results suggest that the product ofDjvlgAmay be a component of the <b>chromatoid</b> <b>body</b> and may be involved in the totipotency of the neoblast...|$|E

However, there are mouse homologues of Drosophila maternal effect genes, including vasa and tudor, that function in posterior and germ-cell determination. We report here that a targeted mutation in Tudor domain containing 1 /mouse tudor repeat 1 (Tdrd 1 /Mtr- 1), a tudor-related gene in mice, leads to male sterility because of postnatal spermatogenic defects. TDRD 1 /MTR- 1 predominantly localizes to nuage/germinal granules, an evolutionarily conserved {{structure in the}} germ line, and its intracellular localization is downstream of mouse vasa homologue/DEAD box polypeptide 4 (Mvh/Ddx 4), similar to Drosophila vasa-tudor. Tdrd 1 /Mtr- 1 mutants lack, and Mvh/Ddx 4 mutants show, strong reduction of intermitochondrial cement, a form of nuage in {{both male and female}} germ cells, whereas <b>chromatoid</b> <b>bodies,</b> another specialized form of nuage in spermatogenic cells, are observed in Tdrd 1 /Mtr- 1 mutants. Hence, intermitochondrial cement is not a direct prerequisite for oocyte development and fertility in mice, indicating differing requirements for nuage and/or its components between male and female germ cells. The result also proposes that <b>chromatoid</b> <b>bodies</b> likely have an origin independent of or additional to intermitochondrial cement.

The <b>chromatoid</b> <b>body</b> moves actively and non-randomly in the cytoplasm of round spermatids, making frequent contacts with the nuclear envelope. The localization of KIF 17 b thereby offers a potential mechanism for microtubule-dependent mobility of chromatoid bodies, {{as well as for the}} transport of the specific components in and out of the <b>chromatoid</b> <b>body.</b> Interestingly, we demonstrate that KIF 17 b physically interacts with a testis-specific member of the PIWI/Argonaute family, MIWI, a component of chromatoid bodies implicated in RNA metabolism. A functional interplay between KIF 17 b and MIWI might be needed for the loading of haploid RNAs in the <b>chromatoid</b> <b>body.</b> Importantly, chromatoid bodies from round spermatids of miwi-null mice are not fully compacted and remain as a diffuse chromatoid material, revealing the essential role played by MIWI in the formation of chromatoid bodies.

We have visualized these cytoplasmic bridges under phase-contrast optics and recorded the sharing of cytoplasmic material between the spermatids by a digital time-lapse imaging system ex vivo. A multitude of small (ca. 0. 5 �m) granules were seen to move continuously over the bridges, but only 28 % of those entering the bridge were actually transported into other cell. The average speed of the granules decreased significantly during the passage. Immunocytochemistry revealed {{that some of the}} shared granules contained haploid cell-specific gene product TRA 54. We also demonstrate the novel function for the Golgi complex in acrosome system formation by showing that TRA 54 is processed in Golgi complex and is transported into acrosome system of neighboring spermatid. In addition, we propose an intercellular transport function for the male germ cellspecific organelle <b>chromatoid</b> <b>body.</b> This mRNA containing organelle, ca. 1. 8 �m in diameter, was demonstrated to go over the cytoplasmic bridge from one spermatid to another. Microtubule inhibitors prevented all organelle movements through the bridges and caused a disintegration of the <b>chromatoid</b> <b>body.</b> This is the first direct demonstration of an organelle traffic through cytoplasmic bridges in mammalian spermatogenesis.

Tdrd 5 -deficient males are sterile because of spermiogenic arrest at the round spermatid stage, with occasional failure in meiotic prophase.

Mammalian Piwi proteins such as Mili are localized in the cytoplasm of spermatogenic cells, where they {{are associated with a}} germline-specific organelle called the nuage or its derivative, the <b>chromatoid</b> <b>body,</b> as well as with polysomes [9]. To investigate the molecular mechanisms mediated by Mili, we searched for Mili-interacting proteins. Here, we report that Mili specifically interacts with Tudor domain-containing protein 1 (Tdrd 1), a germline protein that contains multiple Tudor domains [10, 11]. This RNA-independent interaction is mediated through the N-terminal domain of Mili and the N-terminal region of Tdrd 1 containing the myeloid Nervy DEAF- 1 (MYND) domain and the first two Tudor domains. In addition, Mili positively regulates the expression of the Tdrd 1 mRNA. Furthermore, Mili and Tdrd 1 mutants share similar spermatogenic defects. However, Tdrd 1, unlike Mili, is not required for piRNA biogenesis.  Our results suggest that Mili interacts with Tdrd 1 in the nuage and <b>chromatoid</b> <b>body.</b> This interaction does not contribute to piRNA biogenesis but represents a regulatory mechanism that is critical for spermatogenesis...|$|E

Here, we show that cells expressing a cytosolic form of PrP termed cyPrP display a large juxtanuclear cytoplasmic RNA organelle. Although cyPrP spontaneously forms aggresomes, we used several mutants to demonstrate that the assembly of this RNA organelle is independent from cyPrP aggregation. Components of the organelle fall into three classes: mRNAs; proteins, including the RNAseIII family polymerase Dicer, the decapping enzyme Dcp 1 a, the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX 6, and the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated proteins SmB/B′/N; and non-coding RNAs, including rRNA 5 S, tRNAs, U 1 small nuclear RNA, and microRNAs. This composition is similar to RNA granules or <b>chromatoid</b> <b>bodies</b> from germ cells, or planarian stem cells and neurons, which are large ribonucleoprotein complexes predicted to function in RNA processing and posttranscriptional gene regulation.

We show that TDRD 6 and TDRD 7 /TRAP, which also contain multiple Tudor domains, specifically localize to nuage and form a ribonucleoprotein complex together with TDRD 1 /MTR- 1. The characteristic co-localization of TDRD 1, 6 and 7 was disrupted in a mutant of mouse vasa homologue/DEAD box polypeptide 4 (Mvh/Ddx 4), which encodes another evolutionarily conserved component of nuage. In vivo over-expression experiments of the TDRD proteins and truncated forms during male germ cell differentiation showed that a single Tudor domain is a structural unit that localizes or accumulates to nuage, but {{the expression of the}} truncated, putative dominant negative forms is detrimental to meiotic spermatocytes. These results indicate that the Tudor-related proteins, which contain multiple repeats of the Tudor domain, constitute an evolutionarily conserved class of nuage components in the germ-line, and their localization or accumulation to nuage is likely conferred by a Tudor domain structure and downstream of Mvh, while the characteristic repeated architecture of the domain is functionally essential for the differentiation of germ cells...|$|R

In this review, first, the results obtained by light microscopic studies on the CB for the first 60 years are examined. Next, many findings revealed by electron microscopic studies are reviewed. Finally, recent molecular cell biological studies concerning the CB are discussed. The conclusion obtained by exploring the papers on CB published during the past 130 years {{is that many of}} the modern molecular cell biological studies are undoubtedl...|$|E
40|$|Some {{structural}} and functional properties of ribosomes from polysomes and from helix aggregates of Entamoeba invadens have been compared by sucrose gradient analysis and assays of in vitro protein synthesis. Actively growing trophozoites, lacking helices, presented normal polysome profiles in sucrose gradients. The single large ribosomal helix aggregate (<b>chromatoid</b> <b>body)</b> of cysts disappeared as {{the cells were}} disrupted. Gradient profiles of cyst extracts contained predominantly large and small ribosome subunit peaks and no evidence of remaining helix fragments or mRNA-bound polysomes. Sequential profiles of trophozoites incubated with NaF or cycloheximide (which both stimulate ribosome aggregation, but at different rates) showed that polysome breakdown occurred before aggregates appeared and, again, that helices broke down to subunits in vitro. Radioactive ribosomes synthesized during vegetative growth were collected into helices during encystation. Subunits of these ribosomes cosedimented with comparable particles isolated from trophozoites. Ribosome...|$|E
40|$|Helices andaggregates of helices (<b>chromatoid</b> <b>bodies)</b> {{composed}} of ribosomelike particles appear in cysts and slow-growing trophozoites of Entamoeba invadens. We found that similar helix aggregates were formed abundantly in actively growing E. invadens trophozoites {{treated with a}} variety of direct or indirect inhibitors of protein synthesis. The inhibitor-induced helices appeared cytochemically and ultrastructurally identical to those seen in cysts. Numerous single helices and small arrays occurred randomly distributed throughout the trophozoite cytoplasm within 15 min after treatment with NaF, which rapidly and completely stopped all nucleic acid and protein synthesis. Cycloheximide (CH), which inhibited protein synthesis as effectively a NaF, stimulated aggregate formation more slowly, and only after a delay of 30 - 60 min. CH temporarily blocked NaF-stimulated aggregated formation. Aggregation was slowest with actinomycin-D, which strongly inhibited RNA synthesis but depressed protein synthesis only slowly. These results suggested that release of ribosomes from mRNA was required for aggregation. Inhibition by CH was reversible, and aggregates disappeared from CH-treated amebas shortly after they were transferred to inhibitor-free frowth medium. There was no evidence that helices assembled about a structural organizer within the cell or that the process involved metabloc activity. It was concluded that the inhibitor-induced helices were {{composed of}} mature, normally functional ribosomes and that helix formation was a spontaneous and reversible consequence of the accumulation withing the cell of free monosomes (or subunits) which were prevented from binding to mRNA...|$|R
40|$|Planarian {{regeneration}} {{depends on}} the presence and precise regulation of pluripotent adult somatic stem cells named neoblasts, which differentiate to replace cells of any missing tissue. A characteristic feature of neoblasts {{is the presence of}} large perinuclear nonmembranous organelles named “chromatoid bodies”, which are comparable to ribonucleoprotein structures found in germ cells of organisms across different phyla. In order to better understand regulation of gene expression in neoblasts, and potentially the function and composition of <b>chromatoid</b> <b>bodies,</b> we characterized homologues to known germ and soma ribonucleoprotein granule components from other organisms and analyzed their function during regeneration of the planarian Dugesia japonica. Expression in neoblasts was detected for 49 of 55 analyzed genes, highlighting the prevalence of post-transcriptional regulation in planarian stem cells. RNAi-mediated knockdown of two factors [ago- 2 and bruli] lead to loss of neoblasts, and consequently loss of regeneration, corroborating with results previously reported for a bruli ortholog in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea (Guo et al., 2006). Conversely, depletion mRNA turnover factors [edc- 4 or upf- 1], exoribonucleases [xrn- 1 or xrn- 2], or DEAD box RNA helicases [Djcbc- 1 or vas- 1] inhibited planarian regeneration, but did not reduce neoblast proliferation or abundance. We also found that depletion of cap-dependent translation initiation factors eIF- 3 A or eIF- 2 A interrupted cell cycle progression outside the M-phase of mitosis. Our results show that a set of post-transcriptional regulators is required to maintain the stem cell identity in neoblasts, while another facilitates proper differentiation. We propose that planarian neoblasts maintain pluripotency by employing mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation exhibited in germ cells and early development of most metazoans...|$|R
40|$|The female gonad of {{the land}} planarians Microplana scharffi and Microplana terrestris {{consists}} of two small germaria located ventrally in the anterior third {{of the body and}} of two ventro-lateral rows of oblong vitelline follicles distributed between the intestinal pouches. Both these structures are enveloped by a tunica composed of an outer extracellular lamina and an inner sheath of accessory cells. Oocyte maturation is characterized by the appearance of <b>chromatoid</b> <b>bodies</b> and the development of endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complexes. These organelles appear to be correlated with the production of egg granules with a fenestrated/granular content of medium electron density, about 4 - 5 mum in diameter, which remain dispersed in the ooplasm of mature oocytes. On the basis of cytochemical tests showing their glycoprotein composition, and their localization in mature oocytes, these egg granules have been interpreted as yolk. In the vitelline follicles, vitellocytes show the typical features of secretory cells with well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complexes involved in the production of eggshell globules and yolk. The eggshell globules, which appear to arise from repeated coalescences of two types of Golgi-derived vesicles, contain polyphenols and, when completely mature, they measure about 1 - 1, 2 mum in diameter and show a meandering/concentric content pattern as is typical of the situation observed in most Proseriata and Tricladida. Mature vitellocytes also contain a large amount of glycogen and lipids as further reserve material. On the basis of the ultrastructural features of the female gonad and in relation to the current literature the two species of rhynchodemids investigated appear to be closely related to the freshwater planarians belonging to the family Dugesiidae...|$|R
