This waste, which is nowadays one of the environmental problems worldwide, presents great potential of being used as mineral addition in blended <b>cements</b> <b>production.</b> This paper shows preliminary results of an ongoing project which {{ultimate goal is to}} investigate the viability of using waste marble dust (WMD), produced by marble Portuguese industry, as cement replacement material. In order to evaluate the effects of the WMD on mechanical behaviour, different mortar blended cement mixtures were tested. These mixtures were prepared with different partial substitution level of cement with WMD. Strength results of WMD blended cements were compared to control cements with same level of incorporation of natural limestone used to produce commercial Portland-limestone cements. The results obtained show that WMD blended cements perform better than limestone blended cements for same replacement level up to 20 % w/w. Therefore, WMD reveals promising attributes for blended <b>cements</b> <b>production...</b>|$|R

It is necessary to establish a material utilization system for the incineration waste ash residues instead of disposing these ashes into landfill. This paper is aimed to study the feasibility of replacing clinker raw materials by waste ash residue for <b>cement</b> clinker <b>production.</b> Sewage sludge ash, MSWI bottom ash and MSWI fly ash are the three main types of ashes being evaluated. The ashes were mixed into raw mixture with different portions to produce cement clinker in a laboratory furnace at approximately 1400 °C. X-ray diffraction and X-ray florescence techniques were used to analyze the phase chemistry and chemical composition of clinkers in order to compare these ash-based clinkers with commercial Portland cement clinker.
