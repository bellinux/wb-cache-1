The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol.

[...] The song is a {{vulnerable}} and [...] "emotional" [...] midtempo synthpop ballad, having a [...] "driving piano melody", with a length of three minutes and forty-seven seconds. Spins James Grebey wrote that the song [...] "largely showcases her passionate, conflicted vocals over restrained, electropop-leaning swells of emotional synths and drum taps." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Used to Love You" [...] is a break-up anthem, where Stefani is questioning how she fell in love with her ex in the first place. The majority of music critics noted that the song is inspired by Stefani's divorce from Gavin Rossdale, after a 13-year marriage. In an interview for Todays Matt Lauer, Stefani confirmed that the track was inspired by the end of her marriage, claiming: [...] "I’ve never put a record out where I’m actually going through things in real time. his is like, I wrote that song like a couple weeks ago."

In the first verse, the singer counts her relationship's [...] "twenty-second of loneliness" [...] and expresses how she still loves her boyfriend even acknowledging that he has been cheating on her. Moving on to the song's bridge, she suddenly uses a lower register to [...] "nonchalantly" [...] reveal: [...] "I'll never leave him down, though I might mess around / It's only <b>cause</b> <b>I</b> need some affection." [...] "So I creep / Yeah / And I'll just keep it on the down low," [...] she low-key sings the hook as if she is [...] "confessing to a chosen few." [...] Opening up the second verse, Watkins again counting her [...] "twenty-third of loneliness" [...] and still talks about her love for the partner despite signs of a broken romance. After performing the chorus again, her fellow member Thomas joins in to [...] "sweetly" [...] reveal the reason why's she cheating around is because she needs some attention from her lover. Watkins finally ends the track with the lines [...] "I creep around because I need attention / I don't mess around with my affection" [...] while fading out with the heavy beat and the horn sample. Billboard Larry Flick said the two's vocals in the track were [...] "tightly woven" [...] and [...] "rife with raspy grit," [...] which gave a nice contrast to the song's horn sample and funk guitars.|$|E
