40|$|Batters {{are highly}} complex systems with wide ranging {{ingredients}} including flours, water, flavorings, and spices. Interactions between the ingredients determine {{the performance of}} batters and the final quality of coated products. Addition of hydrocolloids into batters {{of different types of}} flour provides special effects on batter performance. The functionalities of hydrocolloids-flour mixtures in terms of the thermal and rheological properties of the resulting batter systems were investigated in this study. The rheological properties of the batter were determined using a strain/stress control rheometer. A steady state method was used to measure the viscosity {{as a function of the}} shear rate varying from 0. 5 to 150 s- 1 at 15 °C. The resulting data was then fitted to the Herschel-Bulkley Model. The viscoelastic properties were monitored as a function of temperature and were determined using a dynamic oscillatory test. Two different temperature profiles were used to simulate cooking and storage processes. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine thermal properties (namely glass transition temperature, gelatinization temperature, ice melting temperature, and enthalpy) and to describe the phase transitions that occur during heating and cooling processes. The rheological and thermal properties varied for different types of flours and their combination ratios, as well as different types of hydrocolloids at different concentrations. The replacement of corn flour greatly altered the viscosity and viscoelastic properties of wheat based and rice based batter systems. Using 100 % corn flour based batter showed highest yield stress, whereas 100 % rice flour based batter did not show any yield stress. Higher temperatures and longer times were required to gelatinize starch at the higher levels of rice flour for each batter system flour mix combination. The various combination ratios of the flours apparently did not significant influence the gelatinization temperatures of the batter systems. However they significantly influence the total enthalpies (DeltaHG) of the various samples. Wheat flour based batters showed the lowest glass transition temperatures. Thermal properties of wheat-based batters were influenced by the replacement of wheat with rice or corn flours. Corn flour based batters required considerably more energy for gelatinization during the cooking process. Hydrocolloids lowered flow behavior index (n) and increased the consistency index (k) of all batters. The gums also changed the onset temperature of structure development and the storage and loss moduli of the batter systems. Hydrocolloids greatly influenced the thermal properties of batter systems. The gums shifted gelatinization temperature and depressed glass transition temperature of resulting batter systems. Further, MC increased the melting temperature (Tm) for the test batter systems as compared with the values for the control system without methylcellulose (MC). Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) did not show statistically significant effects on the total enthalpies of ice melting for all samples. However, MC and CMC showed more pronounced effects on rice, corn, and their <b>combined</b> <b>flour</b> based batters than it did on wheat flour based batters.

The level of released cyclodextrins (CD) was assessed, besides the microstructure, crystallinity, pasting properties and starch hydrolysis of the flours. Photomicrographs of enzymatically treated flours suggested {{the production of}} fragile structures that broke easily. Enzymatic hydrolysis was significantly higher in extruded flours, as confirmed the CD levels, being predominant the γ-CD followed by α-CD, whereas very low β-CD values were obtained {{probably due to the}} formation of CD–lipid complexes, as suggested X-ray diffractometry results. Both extruded and native samples showed very low viscosity and flat pasting profile consequence of the enzyme hydrolytic activity on the starch chains. Enzymatically treated flours (native and extruded) showed higher hydrolysis rates at the early hydrolysis stage, and extruded flours exhibited higher fractal exponent h in agreement with the extended crystalline structures resulting from enzymatic treatment.

This study was undertaken to examine the possibility of utilizing peach pomace {{as a source of}} soluble dietary fiber in expanded extruded food products. Peach pomace was <b>combined</b> with rice <b>flour</b> at four different levels. The four blends were mixed, dried to a moisture level of 13. 5 % (w/w) and ground to flour. These blends were extruded in a twin-screw extruder (Clextral EV- 25) at a feed flow rate of 15 kg/h. The extruded products were analyzed for physical and textural properties.

40|$|Purpose Underlying {{mechanisms}} of the beneficial {{health effects of}} low glycemic index starchy foods are not fully elucidated yet. We varied the wheat particle size to obtain fiber-rich breads with a high and low glycemic response and investigated the differences in postprandial glucose kinetics and metabolic response after their consumption. Methods Ten healthy male volunteers participated in a randomized, crossover study, consuming C- 13 -enriched breads with different structures; a control bread (CB) made from wheat <b>flour</b> <b>combined</b> with wheat bran, and a kernel bread (KB) where 85 % of flour was substituted with broken wheat kernels. The structure of the breads was characterized extensively. The use of stable isotopes enabled calculation of glucose kinetics: rate of appearance of exogenous glucose, endogenous glucose production, and glucose clearance rate. Additionally, postprandial plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, glucagon, incretins, cholecystokinin, and bile acids were analyzed. Results Despite the attempt to obtain a bread with a low glycemic response by replacing flour by broken kernels, the glycemic response and glucose kinetics were quite similar after consumption of CB and KB. Interestingly, the glucagon- like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) response was much lower after KB compared to CB (iAUC, P < 0. 005). A clear postprandial increase in plasma conjugated bile acids was observed after both meals. Conclusions Substitution of 85 % wheat flour by broken kernels in bread {{did not result in}} a difference in glucose response and kinetics, but in a pronounced difference in GLP- 1 response. Thus, changing the processing conditions of wheat for baking bread can influence the metabolic response beyond glycemia and may therefore influence health...|$|R

The reasons for our study include the area under cultivation, the remarkable amount of protein in chickpeas and lentils, as well as the public interest in tending to meat products, especially hamburgers. Materials and Methods: In this study, beef burgers were <b>combined</b> with chickpea <b>flour</b> and lentil flour at 4 %, 8 % and 12 % levels. We evaluated the properties of uncooked beef burgers, including protein, fat, moisture, ash, pH, texture profile (hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess and chewiness), cooking properties, and sensory attributes. Results: Compared with the controls, the percentage of the samples’ protein and fat increased with the rise in the level of chickpea and lentil flour. At 12 % level, the chickpea and lentil flour had the lowest ash content. Samples of hamburgers with lentil flour at 12 % level had the highest pH value. The hardness, chewiness and gumminess value of the samples significantly increased with increase in the level of chickpea and lentil flour, compared to the controls. At the level of 12 %, the lentil flour had the lowest shrinkage percentage. Scores for all sensory parameters except for appearance decreased with increase in the level of extension. Conclusions: We successfully produced a new product with significant nutritional value, cooking features and acceptable sensory-textural properties. Hamburger with 4 % content of chickpea or lentil flour had sensory properties similar to the control, and was rated close to very good.

To evaluate effects of direct and indirect exposures of T. castaneum and T. confusum eggs, larvae, pupae, or eggs to the insecticide aerosol within a flour mill, the following treatments were made to each life stage: insects treated with aerosol and transferred to treated or untreated flour, untreated insects transferred to treated flour, and insects and <b>flour</b> <b>combined</b> and treated together. Different degrees of harborage or sanitation levels were created by exposing T. confusum larvae, pupae, and adults to pyrethrin aerosol in Petri dishes containing 0, 0. 1, 1, 5, and 10 g of wheat flour. Effects of pyrethrin dispersal in open and obstructed positions and seasonal temperature variations were assessed by exposing T. confusum pupae and adults in open positions and inside wooden boxes (1 m long, 20 cm wide, and 5, 10, or 20 cm high) inside experimental sheds maintained at target temperatures of 22, 27, and 32 °C. Results showed that when T. castaneum and T. confusum were directly exposed to aerosol without the flour source, or with a low amount of flour at open exposed areas, the aerosol provided good control against all life stages of T. castaneum and T. confusum. However, when insects were indirectly exposed (treated together with flour or untreated insects were transferred to treated flour), or treated together with deeper flour amounts, and exposed inside the boxes, the efficacy was greatly reduced. Eggs and pupae of both the species were more susceptible compared to larvae and adults. Additionally, the moribund adults initially observed in indirect exposure treatments, or at the deeper flour depth and exposure positions insides the boxes, were better able to recover. Generally, temperatures {{in the range of}} 22 - 32 °C had no significant effects on overall efficacy of pyrethrin aerosol...|$|R
40|$|In Africa, two {{important}} agricultural research centres the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Nigeria, and the French Conseil National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) have developed food supplements using a soya-bean base {{to be given}} to small children {{in the process of being}} weaned. Experiments have shown that these soya compounds provide a substitute which could replace milk. The objective is to supply children aged between 6 months and 2 years with a foodstuff both suited to their increased energy and protein requirements and tolerated by their digestive systems, since children cannot in fact break down the same foodstuffs as adults. In addition, the basic foodstuffs of families in the low-income group (ie maize flour, sorghum and cassava) provide the right quantities of food needed to satisfy a child's hunger, but not his protein requirements. The soya meal developed by the CNRS and IITA <b>combines</b> both maize <b>flour</b> and meal from shelled, improved soyabean, grounded and baked The product is then diluted in sterilized water and has a similar consistency to that of milk. The CNRS has also developed both an inexpensive grill and a mill which can be made locally. IITA has been carrying out research on soya-bean and the use of its derivatives for several years. The success of 'soya-milk' as a weaning supplement has led to some particularly interesting results: the holding of classes to give instruction in the dosage and use of the mixture, which have spread to women's organisations throughout the region; and the creation, with the help of the IITA, of a co-operative for the growing and marketing of soya, using the improved seed prepared by the Institute. The lnstitute is supported by USAID. For further information, contact: IITA PMB 5320, Oyo Road, Ibadan. Nigeria. Tel: 41 - 32 - 44 / 42 33 1 5 / 41 34 40. Telex : 31417 TROPIC NG.

40|$|As doenças circulatórias atingem as populações de países desenvolvidos e em desenvolvimento e uma de suas principais causas são os altos níveis de colesterol e triglicerídeos séricos. Este trabalho foi realizado com o objetivo de desenvolver uma formulação de biscoito, com a combinação de farinha desengordurada de soja (FDS) e farelo de aveia (FA) como ingredientes funcionais e testar, através de estudo de intervenção em humanos, a sua possível ação hipocolesterolêmica. Além desses dois ingredientes, também foi estudado o efeito de maltodextrina e de xilanases, como possíveis melhoradores de textura. A dureza e o diâmetro dos biscoitos aumentaram com teores maiores de maltodextrina, assim como maiores teores de FDS e FA proporcionaram aumento da umidade e da luminosidade dos biscoitos. A adição de xilanases ocasionou aumento na dureza dos biscoitos. Na análise descritiva de Perfil Livre, comparando-se três diferentes amostras, verificou-se que aquela com maior teor de FDS diferenciou-se das com maior teor de FA e com teores iguais de FDS e FA, sendo caracterizada como mais dura, de cor mais escura e apresentando sabor mais característico de biscoito integral/cereal. No entanto, não se observou diferença na aceitação. A formulação com maior teor de FA foi selecionada para a avaliação clínica. Esta foi realizada através de ensaio randomizado, duplo cego, com a participação de 82 voluntários hipercolesterolêmicos, divididos em dois grupos (Teste - GT e Controle - GC). Os voluntários consumiram biscoitos com FDS e FA (GT) e biscoitos sem estes ingredientes (GC), durante 28 dias (90 g ± 1 g de biscoito/dia, correspondentes a 3, 1 g de ?-glucana e 14, 86 g de proteína de soja no GT). Foram {{realizadas}} análises do perfil lipídico (Colesterol Total - CT, LDL-colesterol, HDL-colesterol e Triglicérides) dos voluntários, nos tempos 0 e 28 dias, para comparação, dentro de cada grupo e entre os grupos. Quando comparados no início e final do estudo, o GT apresentou reduções significativas de 11, 24 % nos valores de CT e 17, 75 % para LDL-c, enquanto que as variações de TG e HDL-c não foram significativas. No GC, as análises mostraram reduções significativas de 5, 9 % nos valores de CT e 11, 01 % em LDL-c e acréscimo de 8, 72 % nos valores de HDL-c. Para Triglicérides não ocorreu variação significativa. Constatou-se que antes do início do estudo os voluntários apresentavam hipercolesterolemia limítrofe (segundo os valores de referência da Sociedade Brasileira de Cardiologia) e que os valores finais de CT e de LDL-c, nosdois grupos, se enquadraram dentro da faixa ótima para CT e desejável para LDL-c. Concluiu-se que o produto testado apresentou ação hipocolesterolêmica e que, embora não tenha havido diferença significativa ao final da intervenção, entre o GC e GT, foi caracterizada uma tendência à ocorrência de maiores índices de redução do CT e LDL-c no GT. The circulatory diseases {{reach the}} populations of developed and developing countries and one of they main causes are {{the high levels of}} cholesterol and seric triglycerides. This work was carried out with the objective of developing a biscuit formulation, <b>combining</b> defatted soy <b>flour</b> (DSF) and oat bran (OB) as functional ingredients and to test, through human intervention study, its possible hypocholesterolemic action. Beyond these two ingredients, also the effect of maltodextrin and xylanases were studied, as possible texture improvers. The hardness and the diameter of biscuits increased with increase of maltodextrin content and higher levels of DSF and OB provided increase in moisture and luminosity of biscuits. The addition of xylanases caused increase in the hardness of biscuits. In the descriptive analysis of Free Choice Profile, comparing three different samples, it was verified that the one with the bigger level of DSF was differentiated of the ones with bigger level of OB and same levels of FDS and FA, being characterized as harder, darker and presenting more characteristic flavor of integral/cereal biscuit. However, difference in the acceptance was not observed. The formulation containing higher level of OB was selected for clinical trial. This was carried out by a randomized double blind assay, with the participation of 82 hypercholesterolemic volunteers, divided in two groups (Test - TG and Control CG). The subjects consumed biscuits with DSF and OA (TG) and biscuits without these ingredients (CG), during 28 days (90 g ± 1 g of biscuits/day corresponding the 3, 1 g of ?-glucana and 14, 86 g of soy protein in TG). Analyses of the lipid profile (Total Cholesterol - TC, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and Triglyceride) of the volunteers had been carried out, in the times 0 and 28 days, for comparison, inside of each group and between the groups. When comparing {{the beginning and end of}} the study, the TG presented significant reductions of 11, 24 % for TC and 17, 75 % for LDL-c, while the variations for TG and HDL-c had not been significant. In the CG, the analyses showed significant reductions of 5, 9 % for TC and 11, 01 % for LDL-c and increase of 8, 72 % in the values of HDL-c. For Triglyceride significant variation did not occur. It was verified that while at the beginning of the study, the volunteers presented bordering hypercholesterolemy (according to values of reference of the Brazilian Society of Cardiology), the final values of TC and LDL-c, in the two groups, were inside the excellent range for TC, and desirable, for LDL-c. It was concluded that the tested product presented hypocholesterolemic action and although it was verified that at the end of the intervention did not have significant difference between the TG and CG it was characterized a trend to the occurrence of bigger indices of reduction of the CT and LDL-c in the TG...|$|R
