50|$|In the {{era that}} {{followed}} the political events of 1988, the film industry has been increasingly controlled by the government. After the 1989 move {{by the government to}} open up the economy, the movie industry was privatised. The film company Mingala became the most powerful company in the industry. Film stars who had been involved in the political activities of the 1980s and 1990s, such as <b>Aung</b> Lwin and <b>Tun</b> Wai, were banned from appearing in films. The films of some directors such as Win Pe have also been banned. The government issues strict rules on censorship and largely determines who produces films, as well as who gets academy awards.|$|R

50|$|Sein Lin (Zaw Lwin) is {{the drummer}} for a {{traditional}} Burmese dance theater group in Rangoon, {{who is very}} passionate about Burmese music, art and cultural traditions. He gets frustrated when, in his opinion, one of the dancers dances against—not with—the beat, and he turns his back on his troupe, only to join another soon after, where he meet and {{falls in love with}} beautiful dancer Khin San (San San Aye). Yet Khin San is at first affronted by Sein Lin’s teachings. Although they argue incessantly, they cannot deny their attraction for one another. When she leaves the group to pursue a career as a film actress, he gives her a small figure as a keepsake, a symbol of traditional theater. He tells her to return it only when she is certain she wants to stay in film. After celebrating her first cinema successes and deciding to marry producer Hla <b>Tun</b> (<b>Aung</b> Pyae), Khin San finally gives the figure back to the heart-broken Sein Lin. The story takes a different turn however when Khin San realizes that Hla Tun has been keeping something significant from her, and she returns to her traveling theater group.|$|R
50|$|When Ba Maw's pro-Japanese {{government}} {{was established in}} 1942, Than Tun served as Minister of Land and Agriculture, and he met and married Khin Gyi, sister of Aung San Suu Kyi's mother Khin Kyi. Aung San married Khin Kyi {{about the same time}} shortly after he became Minister of War; the BIA was renamed the Burma Defence Army (BDA). Than Tun could pass on Japanese intelligence to Thakin Soe who had gone underground in the Delta region in order to organise resistance against the Japanese Occupation. Thakins Thein Pe and Tin Shwe were sent to India to make contact with the British colonial government in exile at Simla. At the end of World War II, after the Japanese had been defeated and the British had returned, Than Tun became general secretary of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) formed by the CPB, the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP, later renamed the Socialist Party) and the BDA, now renamed the Burma National Army (BNA) and led by his brother-in-law <b>Aung</b> San. Than <b>Tun,</b> unlike <b>Aung</b> San, was not among the six men who founded the CPB on August 15, 1939; Aung San was its first secretary general, with Thakin Soe in charge of mass organisation.|$|R

Increasingly, tear stability is recognized to be important for the definition and assessment of patients with dry eye. Recently, two commercially available instruments have been made available for objectively measuring noninvasive tear break-up time (NIBUT), {{as an indicator of}} tear stability: the Tomey RT- 7000 Auto Refractor-Keratometer and Oculus Keratograph (K) 5 M. We aim to assess the agreement of NIBUT measurements using these modalities. Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study was carried out in a tertiary referral eye center and involved 126 consecutive dry eye patients. NIBUT assessment was performed on the right eyes of participants with both the RT- 7000 and the K 5 M techniques, with the order of assessment randomized. The Standardized Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED) questionnaires were administered to assess dry eye symptoms in the 2 weeks before assessment. Results: The age of the participants was 56. 0 ± 14. 3 years (69. 84 % females). Measurements for both modalities were non-normally distributed (right-skewed). The median RT- 7000 and K 5 M readings were 4. 2 (range 0. 1 – 10. 0) and 6. 4 (0. 1 – 24. 9) seconds, respectively. RT- 7000 and K 5 M readings were poorly correlated (ρ= 0. 061, P= 0. 495). Intraclass correlation coefficient between the modalities was 0. 187 (95 % confidence interval - 0. 097 to 0. 406). The Bland–Altman plot showed no systematic differences between the readings with these machines. The agreement between machines was not different in different SPEED categories. Conclusion: While there are theoretical and practical benefits of NIBUT for assessment of tear stability over dye-based methods, the agreement between the two modalities was poor. Hence, studies and trials assessing NIBUT should avoid using these modalities interchangeably for NIBUT assessment. More research is needed to improve consensus on how to determine NIBUT.
