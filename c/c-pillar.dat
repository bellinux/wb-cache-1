25|$|In 1977, the Derby saloon was released, {{which was}} simply a Polo, {{identical}} to the hatchback from the <b>C-pillar</b> forward, with a large boot attached (an Audi proposal which was never sold by them).|$|E
25|$|In some cars, an {{additional}} feature was the so-called opera light that was {{mounted on the}} outside of the B-pillar or <b>C-pillar</b> and lit up when the exterior lights were turned on. (See 1980s Lincoln Town Car, 1979-91 Mercury Grand Marquis, or high-end models of the 1988-1990 Oldsmobile 88).|$|E
25|$|Opera {{windows are}} small {{porthole}} sized side {{windows in the}} <b>C-pillar</b> of some cars. Typically offered in unison with a vinyl roof, they were a very common design feature of American automobiles during the 1970s. The design {{would prove to be}} very popular, indicated by its imitation by almost every domestic manufacturer.|$|E

25|$|The 1969 XW Falcon {{introduced}} bolder styling {{which featured}} raised ridges down each front guard and a 'buttressed' <b>c-pillar</b> (although the rear windscreen was not relocated), {{which made the}} cars appear larger than the XR/XT models. A new dashboard and trim variations also appeared. Factory-fitted fully integrated air conditioning was made available as an option for the first time.|$|E
25|$|Station wagon: A {{variant of}} a sedan/saloon, (also known as estate or estate car) or with its roof {{extended}} rearward over a shared passenger/cargo volume; access {{at the back}} via a third or fifth door instead of a trunk lid; flexible configurations to vary passenger or cargo volume; {{and two or three}} rows of seating — in a two-box design with a A, B & <b>C-pillar,</b> as well as a D pillar.|$|E
25|$|Ford {{designed}} the fourth generation {{with much more}} conservative styling in hopes of increasing the car's appeal. Instead of sloping back, the car's trunk stood upright in a more traditional shape, increasing trunk space by another two cubic feet. The roof was also given a more upright stance to increase headroom, which can be evidenced by the thicker <b>C-pillar</b> and larger area between {{the tops of the}} doors and the top of the roof.|$|E
50|$|Pillars: Both {{configurations}} typically feature A, B & <b>C-pillars,</b> station wagons {{feature a}} D-pillar and hatchbacks may feature a D pillar.|$|R

25|$|In 1974 a {{production}} car was modified and dubbed the Gremlin XP prototype. It has a larger glass hatchback and additional side quarter windows. A pronounced crease started from the mid-body section and wraps {{over the roof}} while the rear quarter panels feature bulges around the wheel well openings. The rear panel has a recessed and blacked out area with four lights. The design of the concept car improved visibility around the Gremlin's original wide <b>C-pillar.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dimensions grew {{slightly}} with sedan body length extended to , {{and for the}} Vista and Camry hardtops to , respectively. Penned by Osamu Shikado, the V30's design is much rounder {{when compared to the}} V20 series. Sedans purge the V20's six-window greenhouse for a four-part setup with integrated window sashes. Up front, the sedan's curved headlamps converge with a slimline grille insert; hardtops get a thinner front assembly with narrower lights, and the <b>C-pillar</b> is raked more sharply. Base cars gain full body-colour coding of peripheral exterior components.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, the GT {{received}} a restyling. Outside there were new one-piece tail lights, grey plastic bumpers, <b>C-pillar</b> vents and side skirts; all bright stainless steel {{save for the}} Alfa Romeo triangular grille was changed to matte-black trim. The 1.6-litre version was discontinued and the Alfetta GTV became known simply as Alfa Romeo GTV2.0; the Alfetta name was dropped, but the two-litre coupé retained its type designation of 11636 for left-hand drive and 11637 for right-hand drive. 15-inch disc-shaped alloy wheels were now standard, {{as opposed to the}} earlier cars' 14-inch pressed steel or optional 14-inch alloy.|$|E
2500|$|Vertical grille inserts {{replaced}} the horizontal {{bars of the}} 1969, movement of [...] "Grand Prix" [...] nameplates from the lower cowls to the rear <b>C-pillars</b> and the vertical chromed louvers from the <b>C-pillars</b> down to the lower cowls, highlighted the 1970 Grand Prix. The optional [...] V8 rated at 370 and [...] in 1969 {{was replaced by a}} new [...] with [...] of torque at 3,100rpm. The base 350hp [...] engine was still standard, but a low-compression 400CID engine was available with a two-barrel carburetor. An automatic transmission was offered as a no cost option.|$|R

The base 350 hp 400 cid L engine was still standard, but a low-compression 400 CID engine was available with a two-barrel carburetor. An automatic transmission was offered as a no cost option.|$|R
5000|$|The new 1971 hardtop {{featured}} a prominent [...] "tunnelback" [...] rear window design with flowing rear pillars, a {{completion of the}} styling exercise of the outgoing model. Hardtops with 'Grande' trim gained a vinyl roof and Grande badges on the <b>C-pillars.</b>|$|R
25|$|When {{the third}} {{generation}} Taurus debuted, it was hurt by criticism of its design, which was formed from oval derived design elements. The design was very controversial, and it strongly limited {{the appeal of the}} car. As a result, for the fourth generation Taurus, Ford designed it with a more subdued, angular design, as part of Ford's New Edge styling, in hopes of increasing the car's appeal. Instead of sloping back, this car's trunk stood upright in a more traditional shape, which greatly increased trunk space. The roof was also raised into a more upright stance to increase headroom, which can be seen by the thicker <b>C-pillar</b> and larger area between the tops of the doors and the top of the roof.|$|E
25|$|The Alfetta saloon was {{the base}} for the Alfetta GT, a 2-door, 4-seater {{fastback}} coupé designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro at Italdesign. Introduced in 1974, similarly to the saloon it was initially available only with the 1.8-litre (1,779cc) version of the Alfa DOHC four. These engines featured a chain driven 8-valve twin overhead cam cylinder head of cross-flow design. For 1976, with the final phasing out of the earlier 105 Series (GT1300 Junior and GT1600 Junior and 2000GTV), the Alfetta GT became a range; the 1.8 was discontinued in favour of the 1.6-litre (1,570cc) Alfetta GT1.6 and 2.0-litre (1,962cc) Alfetta GTV2.0. At the same time some updates were introduced, such as a new front grille with horizontal slats and two series of vents beneath it. The GTV was distinguished from the 1.6 version by twin chrome whiskers in the grille and GTV scripts carved in the ventilation vents on the <b>C-pillar.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1976 the Luxury and Regency {{editions of}} the {{full-size}} 98s were offered, in 2-door coupes or 4-door hardtops. 4-doors had an extra window (like an opera window) in the <b>C-pillar.</b> A landau roof option for the coupe gave it a huge-looking opera window. Like the Custom Cruiser, 98s had a dual section eggcrate-design grille, with new front end panel, front bumper, and wraparound horizontal parking lamps. Amber marker lenses aligned with the headlamps wrapped around the fender sides. Separate clear cornering lamps had horizontal ribs. Vertical tailamps were decorated with a small emblem in each lens. Tiny back-up lamps stood alongside the license plate, on a panel that also contained small red lenses next to the tailamps. Standard 98 equipment included a 455 CID Rocket V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, Turbo-Hydramatic, vari-ratio power steering, power brakes, power driver's seat, driver's door armrest control console, electronic message center, electric clock, fold-down center armrests, front ashtray, and JR78 x 15 blackwall steel-belted radials. Rear fender skirts and bumper impact strips were also standard. A new 2.41:1 axle ratio became standard to improve fuel economy.|$|E
5000|$|... 1997: Last {{year for}} the second-generation Grand Marquis. The Mercury emblems are removed from the <b>C-pillars.</b> Following the {{discontinuation}} of the Chevrolet Caprice and Buick Roadmaster by General Motors, 1997 Grand Marquis sales would rise over 20% in comparison to 1996.|$|R
25|$|Other changes {{included}} {{a totally different}} dashboard layout to the XA/XB series, new rear doors with a lower sill cut, air extraction vents {{in the rear of}} the <b>C-pillars,</b> and very large bumpers front and rear with no additional valance panel under them.|$|R
25|$|The Rambler Rebel was all new, but {{retained}} the same styling concept. The front end featured a full-width die-cast grille, while the two-piece {{front and rear}} bumpers were promoted to cut repair costs. The <b>C-pillars</b> were made narrower and the tail fins were now smaller.|$|R
25|$|In March 1983 the Alfetta {{received}} its last facelift; the exterior was modernised with newly designed bumpers (integrating a front spoiler and extending {{to the wheel}} openings), a new grille, lower body plastic cladding, silver hubcaps and, at the rear, a full width grey plastic fascia supporting rectangular tail lights with ribbed lenses and the number plate. The <b>C-pillar</b> ventilation outlets were moved to {{each side of the}} rear screen. Inside there were a redesigned dashboard and instrumentation, new door panels and the check control panel from the Quadrifoglio Oro on all models. Top of the range models adopted an overhead console, which extended for the full length of the roof and housed three reading spot lamps, a central ceiling light, and controls for the electric windows. Alongside the facelift two new models were introduced: the 2.4 Turbo Diesel, which in most markets gradually replaced the previous 2.0-litre which was instead installed in the marginally smaller Giulietta. There was also a renewed two-liter Quadrifoglio Oro, equipped with electronic fuel injection. Thanks to the Bosch Motronic integrated electronic fuel injection and ignition the QO had the same 130PS output of the carburetted 2.0, while developing more torque and being more fuel efficient.|$|E
2500|$|Each version {{included}} the color-coordinated upholstery and door panels, individually adjustable reclining seats, sports steering wheel, {{as well as}} the [...] of carpeted cargo room, a locking hidden compartment, and a roof rack. Special regional nameplates were on the rear fender in addition to the unique medallions on the <b>C-pillar.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, {{the sedan}} and coupe {{received}} a restyled rear-end, {{along with a}} new <b>C-pillar</b> shape and rear quarters, {{as well as a}} more massive rear end and bumper. The hardtop was changed to a more sloping roofline with upswept reverse-angle quarter windows, giving them [...] "a somewhat huskier look for 1970". The taillights were integrated into a new loop rear bumper with Rebel spelled out between them. The four-door sedans also had an altered roofline with a slimmer <b>C-pillar</b> and larger, squared-off rear door windows. Similarly as on the coupe, the belt line kicked up beneath the trailing edge of the rear door windows, and then tapered back to the same rear fascia as on the hardtop. The Rebel sedans and hardtop models two inches (51mm) longer than previously. The Rebel station wagons saw no change to their rooflines, doors, and rear fascias.|$|E
5000|$|Subsequently the semaphore-style trafficators on the <b>C-pillars</b> were {{replaced}} with flashing indicators within the light cluster. The front lights were modified {{to conform to}} new standards and in 1957 parallel windscreen wipers were substituted for the original [...] "cross hands" [...] ones featured at launch.|$|R
50|$|As a {{precursor}} to the X3, in 2003 BMW presented the xActivity concept vehicle at the Detroit Auto Show featuring the 3 Series platform and a fixed-profile convertible body style with reinforced longitudinal rails connect the A-pillars {{to the rear of}} the car on both sides, eliminating B- or <b>C-pillars.</b>|$|R
25|$|Hatchback: Incorporates {{a shared}} {{passenger}} and cargo volume, with rearmost accessibility via a rear third or fifth door, typically a top-hinged liftgate—and {{features such as}} fold-down rear seats to enable flexibility within the shared passenger/cargo volume. As a two-box design, the body style typically includes A, B and <b>C-pillars,</b> and may include a D-pillar.|$|R
2500|$|The Gran Torino Sport {{was only}} a shadow of its former self for 1974. [...] With the Sportsroof model discontinued, Sport models were often {{difficult}} to distinguish from Gran Torino 2-doors. To add insult to injury, the Sport was even available with optional opera windows (on vinyl-roofed cars) and fender skirts. The Sport continued to have its unique emblems displayed on the grille, the <b>C-pillar,</b> and the fuel filler door, plus [...] "Sport" [...] script was placed by the <b>C-pillar</b> emblem. When opera windows were ordered, the script was placed below the [...] "Gran Torino" [...] nameplate on the fenders, and the <b>C-pillar</b> emblem was deleted. The laser stripe was no longer available, but a lower body multi-coloured non-reflective stripe was an option. The Sport now used the same vinyl door panel of the other Gran Torinos. The instrument package became a standard feature, as were 78 series radial ply tires (70 series used in 1973). Bucket seats remained an option, but now were a low back design with separate head rests. At extra cost, Sport door panels and seats could be highlighted with coloured stripes. The optional [...] "Magnum 500" [...] wheel was revised with the formerly chromed wheel rim replaced by a polished trim ring and argent painted spokes. [...] Performance was even more lackluster for 1974 models, with power down and weight up. The 1974 Sport had a shipping weight almost [...] heavier than a 1972 Sport.|$|E
2500|$|A {{station wagon}} (also {{known as an}} estate or estate car) is an {{automobile}} with a body style variant of a sedan/saloon with its roof extended rearward over a shared passenger/cargo volume with access at the back via a third or fifth door (the liftgate or tailgate), instead of a trunk lid. [...] The body style transforms a standard three-box design into a two-box design—to include an A, B, and <b>C-pillar,</b> {{as well as a}} D-pillar. [...] Station wagons can flexibly reconfigure their interior volume via fold-down rear seats to prioritize either passenger or cargo volume.|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, Nissan and Prince merged and the S50 also {{appeared}} with Nissan Prince Skyline badging. This model lasted in production through 1967. In October 1966, the S50-2 was introduced. This light facelift included a new grille and taillights, {{as well as}} changes to the interior, and {{with the addition of}} an extraction vent on the <b>C-pillar.</b> It was sold as Prince Skyline, Prince A150, or PMC A150, depending on the market. All [...] "Prince" [...] dealership locations were added to the existing Nissan/Datsun Japanese dealerships, while retaining the Prince name to become Nissan Prince Store.|$|E

50|$|Edmunds.com {{praised the}} Malibu's {{interior}} and exterior styling, quietness, and balance between ride and handling, while criticizing the thick <b>C-pillars</b> that obstruct the driver's view, the narrower chassis compared to other midsize cars (which reduces rear seating room and also lacks a center armrest) and lack of features such as dual-zone HVAC, Bluetooth compatibility, and keyless ignition.|$|R
