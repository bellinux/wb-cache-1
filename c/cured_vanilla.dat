The suitable ethanol-water composition for half dried <b>cured</b> <b>vanilla</b> was 7 : 3 (vanillin content 1. 78 g/l). The first optimation was conducted with two variables maceration time and sucrose concentrations. The maximum vanillin content of the first optimation was 4. 5 g/l at maceration time of 15. 9 days and sucrose concentration of 7. 3 g. The second optimation used two variables: maceration time and glycerol concentrations. The maximum vanillin content of the second optimation was 3. 8 g/l at maceration time of 22 days and glycerol concentration 19. 9 ml. The third optimation process used three variables:maceration time, sucrose concentrations and glycerol concentrations.

40|$|The {{continued}} {{high prices}} for vanilla {{on the world}} market have led various countries to establish or revive vanilla production. Madagascar, the world s leading producer of vanilla (Vanilla fragrans), {{has not been able to}} contain the sky-rocketing prices, since the government liberalised the sector in 1995 and abolished fixed price levels. Now producers are in danger of losing part of their market share to competitor countries. At present, the country produces around 1, 200 MT of <b>cured</b> <b>vanilla</b> annually, while the total worldwide output of <b>cured</b> <b>vanilla</b> is around 2, 200 MT. Curing is a six-month process, during which the green vanilla beans are first exposed alternately to moist and dry heat for 20 days, after which the beans are slowly dried to enhance and bring out their well-known flavour in the familiar form of a vanilla stick. Vanilla fragrans is regarded to yield the best or Bourbon quality, which is preferred for foodstuffs, like ice, cakes, chocolate and drinks. Vanilla tahitensis (South Pacific), V. java (Indonesia) and V. pompona (West Indies), yield vanillas that are used for flavouring tobacco, soaps, perfumes and medicines. The average price for green vanilla in 2001 has been around 20 /kg, which in 2000 was 13 /kg and in 1999 only 4 /kg. Prices for <b>cured</b> <b>vanilla</b> amount to approximately t 160 /kg for 2002, so eight times more than green beans fetch. The steep price increase is also driving importers and processors to look for alternatives, both for the product as for the producers. Bioprocessing methods have been developed to harvest more fragrance per unit of <b>cured</b> <b>vanilla</b> and synthetic vanilla is being mixed with, or replacing natural vanilla. Nothing beats the real thing, though, and importers are actively looking for new producers. India and China have taken up vanilla production, but their first vanilla will not reach the market before 2003. Small wonder that last season vanilla growers in Tonga were surprised by eight visiting vanilla buyers, offering 22. 50 per green kilo.

40|$|Vanillin is {{a popular}} and {{valuable}} flavour compound. It is the key constituent of the natural vanilla flavour obtained from <b>cured</b> <b>vanilla</b> pods. Here we show that a single hydratase/lyase type enzyme designated vanillin synthase (VpVAN) catalyses direct conversion of ferulic acid and its glucoside into vanillin and its glucoside, respectively. The enzyme shows high sequence similarity to cysteine proteinases and is specific to the substitution pattern at the aromatic ring and does not metabolize caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid as demonstrated by coupled transcription/translation assays. VpVAN localizes to the inner part of the vanilla pod and high transcript levels are found in single cells located a few cell layers from the inner epidermis.

40|$|Vanilla {{was first}} {{introduced}} to French Polynesia in 1848 and from 1899 - 1966 was a major export for French Polynesia who then produced an average of 158 tonnes of <b>cured</b> <b>Vanilla</b> tahitensis beans annually. In 1967, vanilla production declined rapidly {{to a low of}} 0. 6 tonnes by 1981, which prompted a nation-wide investigation with the aim of restoring vanilla production to its former levels. As a result, a mosaic-inducing virus was discovered infecting V. tahitensis that was distinct from Cymbidium mosaic virus (CyMV) and Odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV) but serologically related to dasheen mosaic virus (DsMV). The potyvirus was subsequently named vanilla mosaic virus (VanMV) and was later reported to infect V. tahitensis in the Cook Islands and V. planifolia in Fiji and Vanuatu. Attempts were made to mechanically inoculate VanMV to a number of plants that are susceptible to DsMV, but with no success. Based on a partial sequence analysis, VanMV-FP (French Polynesian isolate) and VanMV-CI (Cook Islands isolate) were later characterised as strains of DsMV exclusively infecting vanilla. Since its discovery, little information is known about how VanMV-CI acquired the ability to exclusively infect vanilla and lose its ability to infect natural hosts of DsMV or vice versa. The aims of this research were to characterise the VanMV genome and attempt to determine the molecular basis for host range specificity of VanMV-CI. VanMV-CI has a typical potyvirus genome structure encoding a single polyprotein which can potentially be cleaved into ten proteins, flanked by 5 ’ and 3 ’ untranslated regions (UTR). Sequence comparisons of individual genes and complete genomes from members of the bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) group to which DsMV belongs revealed VanMV-CI is most closely related to DsMV. Sequence analyses revealed VanMV-CI is 75. 1 - 77. 5 % and 81. 8 - 84. 1 % identical to DsMV at the nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) levels, respectively in the coat protein (CP) and 75. 8 - 77. 1 % and 81. 9 - 86. 7 % identical to DsMV at the nt and aa levels, respectively over the entire genome. These data are consistent with the findings of Farreyrol et al. (2005) who first suggested that VanMV-CI is a strain of DsMV. The origin of VanMV-CI is unclear. Did it evolve from DsMV or was it the progenitor of DsMV? To try answer this, a recombination and phylogenetic analysis was carried out. A recombination analysis between DsMV and VanMV-CI genome sequences was carried out against all available potyvirus genomes to determine whether VanMV-CI emerged {{as a result of a}} recombination event between DsMV and another virus. This analysis was also to determine whether the N-terminal P 1 gene of VanMV-CI arose as a result of a recombination event giving VanMV the ability to exclusively infect vanilla spp. The reasoning for focussing on this genome region is outlined below. This analysis found two recombination events in the P 1 gene of DsMV, one in its N-terminal region and another in its C-terminus. Sequence identities between DsMV and its major parent however, were lower than 75 % and the recombination event was only detected by one detection method producing insufficient evidence for VanMV arising as a result of one or more recombination events. A phylogenetic analysis based on the complete genome showed that the emergence of VanMV-CI preceded the publicly available DsMV genomes. However, a maximum likelihood analysis of the entire CP of VanMV-CI and all available DsMV CP sequences showed that VanMV-CI was most closely related to DsMV in the South Pacific and the origin of DsMV in this region preceded VanMV-CI. In addition, this analysis showed that DsMV likely originated in the Asia region (China, Japan and India) where its natural host (Colocasia esculenta and Xanthosoma species) originated- it is possible that DsMV spread to the Pacific with human migration. Thus, it is most likely that VanMV arose from DsMV, by an as yet unknown mechanism- possibly by random mutation and natural selection or by a recombination event between DsMV and an as yet to be discovered virus. Upon sequence comparison with DsMV, the P 1 -HC-Pro region of VanMV-CI became a region of interest for determining a molecular basis for the difference in host range, as this was the most divergent area between the two genomes. This difference was largely due to an insertion/deletion (indel) found in the N-terminal region of the VanMV-CI P 1. According to a number of studies, the N-terminal region of the potyviral P 1 gene must be compatible with a still unknown host factor before its C-terminus can effectively cleave between itself and HC-Pro. Without successful separation from P 1, HC-Pro is unable to counterattack RNA silencing by plants and the virus ceases to infect its host. This suggests that the VanMV-CI P 1 may be the region responsible for its ability to infect vanilla but not aroids. An agroinfiltration experiment was designed to test the functionality of the P 1 region as a viral suppressor of RNA interference (VSR) to provide support for its role as a host range determinant. A series of gene constructs were designed to test the function of the VanMV-CI and DsMV P 1 genes in combination with the HC-Pro region to determine if the HC-Pro activity of each virus is affected by the origin of the P 1. The HC-Pro and P 1 -HC-Pro regions of VanMV-CI and a New Zealand isolate of DsMV were amplified to generate a series of wild type and hybrid constructs for future use in determining their ability to counterattack RNA silencing by plants (silencing suppressor activity). The wild type constructs (PKP 2 and PKP 4) and a hybrid PKP 6 construct containing DsMV P 1 /VanMV-CI HC-Pro were generated. Generating the alternative hybrid PKP 5 construct (VanMV-CI P 1 / DsMV HC-Pro) was unsuccessful, most probably due to a lack of sequence complementarity between the fusion templates (VanMV-CI P 1 and DsMV HC-Pro fusions). Attempts were made to transform the constructs PKP 1 -PKP 4 (VanMV HC-Pro, VanMV P 1 /VanMV HC-Pro, DsMV HC-Pro and DsMV P 1 /DsMV HC-Pro respectively) into a pHEX 2 expression vector for agroinfiltration into Nicotiana benthamiana to examine the difference in silencing suppressor activity in light of the difference in P 1. Cloning of the PKP 6 construct into the entry vector (pCR 8) was unsuccessful and transformation of expression vectors containing PKP constructs with Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV 3101 also encountered a number of problems. This was most likely due to the use of the inefficient freeze-thaw method. Although the agroinfiltration experiment could not be completed, PKP constructs including HC-Pro and P 1 /HC-Pro of VanMV and DsMV were amplified and incorporated into the destination expression vector pHEX 2 and their sequences confirmed...|$|E
50|$|Rawleigh’s {{expansion}} continued {{after the}} war with factories established in Australia in 1928 and in New Zealand in 1931. He also established warehouses in Zanzibar, Madagascar and Sumatra, where raw materials such as vanilla, cloves, pepper, ylang-ylang and oil of geranium were assembled before being shipped to his factories. Rawleigh opened a vanilla office in Tamatave and began to cultivate, <b>cure</b> and buy <b>vanilla.</b> He did this because {{at that time the}} vanilla industry was highly inflated, closely controlled and manipulated and prices were about double what they should have been. To ensure the quality of his products, Rawleigh personally visited most of the countries where he sourced raw materials, including stops in Indonesia, Singapore, Japan, and China.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. The {{traditional}} <b>curing</b> of <b>vanilla</b> pods includes "killing" {{and sweating}} steps when pods {{are exposed to}} heat (35 - 65 degrees C) for various lengths of time. Although {{it is known that}} liberation of vanillin and other phenolics from their non- aromatic glucosides is due to the action of an endogenous beta-glucosidase, its in vivo kinetics remained unknown. Materials and methods. Mature green vanilla pods were pretreated for 2 h at 50 degrees C, 55 degrees C and 60 degrees C, then stored for 118 days at 27 degrees C. Phenolic glucosides and their aglycons were extracted at regular intervals during the storage period and analyzed by HPLC. Results and discussion. All phenolic beta-glucosides were slowly hydrolyzed during the storage period with production of vanillin, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillic acid, and other unknown aglycons. Most of the beta-glucosidase was heat-denatured by the pretreatment, and analysis of its kinetic parameters showed that it adopts, in vivo, an allosteric mode of functioning with a lower affinity for glucovanillin than in vitro, where it behaves as a Michaelian enzyme. Conclusion. Extensive research is needed to confirm the allosteric mechanism of the vanilla beta-glucosidase in vivo...|$|R
5000|$|Once fully <b>cured,</b> the <b>vanilla</b> fruits are sorted by {{quality and}} graded. Several vanilla fruit grading systems are in use. Each country which {{produces}} vanilla {{has its own}} grading system, and individual vendors, in turn, sometimes use their own criteria for describing {{the quality of the}} fruits they offer for sale. In general, vanilla fruit grade is based on the length, appearance (color, sheen, presence of any splits, presence of blemishes), and moisture content of the fruit. Whole, dark, plump and oily pods that are visually attractive, with no blemishes, and that have a higher moisture content are graded most highly. Such pods are particularly prized by chefs for their appearance and can be featured in gourmet dishes. Beans that show localized signs of disease or other physical defects are cut to remove the blemishes; the shorter fragments left are called [...] "cuts" [...] and are assigned lower grades, as are fruits with lower moisture contents. Lower-grade fruits tend to be favored for uses in which the appearance is not as important, such as in the production of vanilla flavoring extract and in the fragrance industry.|$|R
