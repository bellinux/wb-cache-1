60|$|What, then, {{is to be}} done? For the present, unfortunately, little except {{propagating}} {{the conception}} of Children's Rights. Only the achievement of economic equality through Socialism can {{make it possible to}} deal thoroughly with the question {{from the point of view}} of the total interest of the community, which must always consist of grown-up children. Yet economic equality, like all simple and obvious arrangements, seems impossible to people brought up as children are now. Still, something can be done even within <b>class</b> <b>limits.</b> Large communities of children of the same class are possible today; and voluntary organization of outdoor life for children has already begun in Boy Scouting and excursions of one kind or another. The discovery that anything, even school life, is better for the child than home life, will become an over-ridden hobby; and we shall presently be told by our faddists that anything, even camp life, is better than school life. Some blundering beginnings of this are already perceptible. There is a movement for making our British children into priggish little barefooted vagabonds, all talking like that born fool George Borrow, and supposed to be splendidly healthy because they would die if they slept in rooms with the windows shut, or perhaps even with a roof over their heads. Still, this is a fairly healthy folly; and it may do something to establish Mr Harold Cox's claim of a Right to Roam as the basis of a much needed law compelling proprietors of land to provide plenty of gates in their fences, and to leave them unlocked when there are no growing crops to be damaged nor bulls to be encountered, instead of, as at present, imprisoning the human race in dusty or muddy thoroughfares between walls of barbed wire.|$|E

50|$|Type 400-ton class ammo ship is {{the result}} of the need of a {{replenishment}} ship that can supply ammo at the sea, because the first generation Chinese replenishment oiler Type 905 Fuqing class lacked of the capability to supply ammunition, so ammo ships are needed to work in conjunction with Type 905 and other replenishment oilers. However, the small size of the 400-ton <b>class</b> <b>limits</b> it to the coastal waters, so in order to supply fleets much further out in the ocean, larger ammunition ships such as Yantai class were needed by the surface combatants. As a result, only a single unit of Type 400-ton class ammo ship was built.|$|E

5000|$|Race, ethnicity, and {{socio-economic}} <b>class</b> <b>limits</b> {{exposure to}} advanced academic knowledge thus limiting advanced educational opportunities. A {{disproportionate number of}} minority students are placed in low track courses. The content of low track courses are markedly different. Low and average track students typically have limited exposure to [...] "high-status" [...] academic material, thus, the possibility of academic achievement and subsequent success is significantly limited. The tracking phenomenon in schools tends to perpetuate prejudices, misconceptions, and inequalities {{of the poor and}} minority people in society. Schools provide both an education and a setting for students to develop into adults, form future societal roles, and maintain social and organizational structures of society. Tracking in the public educational system parallels the hierarchical social and economic structures in society. Schools have a unique acculturative process that helps to pattern self-perceptions and world views. The expectations of the teachers and information taught differ based on tracks. Thus, dissimilar classroom cultures, different dissemination of knowledge, and unequal education opportunities are created.|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of an EXAP procedure for copper communication cables (CCC) has been investigated. The test set consisted of 47 different cables split into 9 families. An analysis method for quantifying {{the confidence of}} an EXAP procedure was defined. A similar EXAP procedure as for power cables was investigated, but where the safety margin sm was varied between 0 % and 40 % of the <b>class</b> <b>limits</b> for the corresponding Euroclasses. For power cables, and also for optical cables (OF) this safety margin was fixed to 10 % of the <b>class</b> <b>limits</b> for the main classification (B 2 ca, Cca, and Dca) and 20 % fire the smoke classes S 1 and S 2. For the analysed CCC {{it was found that}} the safety margin must be higher in order to obtain a confidence on the same level as for the OF EXAP already published in a Position Paper. The error rate for the OF EXAP was 2 % for the main class. This error rate was obtained with a safety margin of 30 % of the <b>class</b> <b>limits</b> for CCC. Even higher safety margins result in a lower error rate but a trade-off must be made between confidence in the EXAP and a reasonable, not too conservative, classification of CCC. Therefore a CCC EXAP is proposed with a safety margin sm = 30 % of the <b>class</b> <b>limits</b> for the corresponding Euroclasses.

40|$|Combination {{of remote}} sensing {{technique}} and direct measurements {{were used to assess}} and map the status and inherent risk of wind erosion and to compare different methods used. Remote sensing technique showed that the study area was moderately affected by wind erosion. The use of percentage coverage by gravels, as an indicator of status, showed that three of the four studied sites were slightly affected by wind erosion. However, this method failed to assess the status of the fourth site which was free of gravel but contained sand dunes. This result is not applicable in eroded sites that do not expose surface gravel. The use of soil erodibility, as determined by aggregates greater than 0. 84, and applying <b>class</b> <b>limits</b> suggested by Chepil (1960), showed that the inherent risk of site one was negligible and that of site two was slight, while those of site three and inter-dunes of site four were moderate. This method proved to be compatible with the {{remote sensing technique}} for identifying the status of wind erosion in the four studied sites. Using mean annual wind speed as an indicator of wind erosivity and applying FAO/UNEP (1984) <b>class</b> <b>limits,</b> the whole area had a moderate inherent risk of wind erosion. However, lack of differences between sites was due to the occurrence of only one data point representing the whole area including the four sites. In conclusion, remote sensing technique is reliable for large-scale wind erosion studies. However, some pertinent ground checks by the direct method are advisabl...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Burned forested {{areas have}} {{patterns}} of varying burn severity {{as a consequence}} of various topographic, vegetation, and meteorological factors. These patterns are detected and mapped using satellite data. Other ecological information can be abstracted from satellite data regarding rates of recovery of vegetation foliage and variation of burn severity on different vegetation types. Middle infra-red wavelengths are useful for burn severity mapping because the land cover changes associated with burning increase reflectance {{in this part of the}} electromagnetic spectrum. Simple stratification of Landsat Thematic Mapper data define varying classes of burn severity be-cause of changes in canopy cover, biomass removal, and soil chemical composition. Reasonable maps of burn se-verity are produced when the <b>class</b> <b>limits</b> of burn severit...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} climat ic classifications is {{available}} for the Prairie Provinces, or portions thereof, based on modifications of Koppen ' s or Thornthwaite ' s systems or other criter ia. Such classificat ions, often based on predetermined a priori <b>class</b> <b>limits,</b> lack the detail required for assessing forest land-use productivity or conducting and applying forest research; generally, they show few subdivisions of the forested areas. A climatic c lassification using a fac torial a posteriori approach was developed for the forested areas of the Prairies based on daily temperature and precipitation records from 303 stations for the months May to September for the years 1961 to 1970. A matrix of 2 2 independent variables that explain most of the variation between stations was employed.

40|$|Nearest {{prototype}} approaches offer {{a common}} way to design classifiers. However, when data is noisy, {{the success of}} this sort of classifiers depends on some parameters that the designer needs to tune, as the number of prototypes. In this work, we have made a study of the ENPC technique, based on the nearest prototype approach, in noisy datasets. Previous experimentation of this algorithm had shown that it does not require any parameter tuning to obtain good solutions in problems where <b>class</b> <b>limits</b> are well defined, and data is not noisy. In this work, we show that the algorithm is able to obtain solutions with high classification success even when data is noisy. A comparison with optimal (hand made) solutions and other different classification algorithms demonstrates the good performance of the ENPC algorithm in accuracy and number of prototypes as the noise level increases. We have performed experiments in four different datasets, each of them with different characteristics. Publicad...|$|E

40|$|Any {{noise in}} {{measurements}} (due to the scene, sensor, or the analog to digital process) causes a finite fraction of measurements {{to fall outside}} of the classification limits.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} of tigecycline against 1, 924 clinical isolates were examined. The new glycylcycline exhibited excellent activity against all gram-positive cocci (MICs at which 90 % of the isolates tested were inhibited [MIC 90 s], < 1 g/ml). In addition, {{it was also}} very potent against {{most members of the}} Enterobac-teriaceae, with most MIC 90 s being < 2 g/ml.
