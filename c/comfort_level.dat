The primacy of sex in the evolutionary process suggests that predictions derived from evolutionary theory may be a useful first step toward understanding these contemporary behaviors. This study assessed the hook-up behaviors and attitudes of 507 college students. As predicted by behavioral-evolutionary theory: men were more comfortable than women with all types of sexual behaviors; women correctly attributed higher <b>comfort</b> <b>levels</b> to men, but overestimated men’s actual comfort levels; and men correctly attributed lower <b>comfort</b> <b>levels</b> to women, but still overestimated women’s actual <b>comfort</b> <b>levels.</b> Both genders attributed higher <b>comfort</b> <b>levels</b> to same-gendered others, reinforcing a pluralistic ignorance effect that might contribute to the high frequency of hook-up behaviors {{in spite of the}} low <b>comfort</b> <b>levels</b> reported and suggesting that hooking up may be a modern form of intrasexual competition between females for potential mates...|$|R

25|$|Research {{has shown}} that the direct rebound effects for energy {{services}} is lower at high income levels, due to less price sensitivity. Studies have found that own-price elasticity of gas consumption by UK households was two times greater for households in the lowest income decile when compared to the highest decile. Studies have also observed higher rebounds in low-income houses for improvements in heating technology. Evaluation methods have also been used to assess the scale of rebound effects from efficient heating installations in lower income homes in the United Kingdom. This research found that direct effects are close to 100% in many cases. High income households in developed countries are likely to set the temperature at the optimum <b>comfort</b> <b>level,</b> regardless of the cost – therefore any cost reduction does not result in increased heating, for it was already optimal. But low-income households are more price sensitive, and have made thermal sacrifices due to the cost of heating. In this case, a high direct rebound is likely. This analogy can be extended to most household energy consumption.|$|E

Amongst them, wind and thermal <b>comfort</b> <b>levels</b> for pedestrians have attracted research interest. In this regards, urban wind environment {{is seen as}} a crucial components that can lead to improved thermal <b>comfort</b> <b>levels</b> for pedestrian population. High rise building in modern urban setting causes high levels of turbulence that renders discomfort to pedestrians. Additionally, a higher frequency of high ris e buildings at a particular region acts as a shield against the wind flow to the lower buildings beyond them resulting into higher levels of discomfort to users or residents. Studies conducted on developing wind flow models using Computational Fluid Dynami cs (CFD) simulations have revealed improvement in interval to height ratios can results into improved wind flow within the simulation grid. However, high value and demand for land in urban areas renders expansion to be an impractical solution. Nonetheless, innovative utilization of architectural concepts can be imagined to improve the pedestrian <b>comfort</b> <b>levels</b> through improved wind permeability. This paper assesses the possibility of through-building gaps being a solution to improve pedestrian <b>comfort</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R

A TRNSYS model of the kindergarten {{has been used to}} predict the current occupant <b>comfort</b> <b>levels</b> and subsequently determine {{the most effective way to}} alter the traditional construction methods to improve <b>comfort</b> <b>levels.</b> Improvements investigated were: reduced air infiltration, roof and wall insulation (separately and together), installation of a smokeless stove and a combination of all strategies. The model predicted that in the current building the PMV ranges from - 1. 94 in October to - 0. 99 in July. It also predicted that the current PPD (%) ranges from 100 in January to 26 in July. With the combination of strategies, the predicted PMV values were all improved to between - 1. 08 and + 0. 34, and the PPD values of all months except January were reduced to below 10 %. When improving the <b>comfort</b> <b>levels</b> of an existing school, reducing air infiltration, adding roof insulation and installing a smokeless stove are the most effective strategies. When constructing a new school, however, reducing air infiltration and adding insulation to the walls and roof are the most effective and feasible strategies.

40|$|Humla Province is {{a remote}} mountainous region of {{northwest}} Nepal. The climate is harsh {{and the local}} people are extremely poor. Most people endure a subsistence culture, living in traditional housing. Energy for cooking and heating comes from fuelwood, supplies of which are diminishing. In order to improve the indoor environment and reduce fuelwood use, smokeless stoves are being introduced to replace the open fire in Humli homes. There is some concern, however, that <b>comfort</b> <b>levels</b> {{may not be as}} acceptable with these stoves. The aim of this research was therefore to investigate ways in which the <b>comfort</b> <b>levels</b> in traditional Humli housing might be improved using simple and low cost strategies. Temperature data was recorded in four rooms of a traditional Humli home over a 12 -day period and used with fuelwood data to validate a TRNSYS simulation model of the house. This model was then used to evaluate the impact on <b>comfort</b> <b>levels</b> in the house of various energy conservation strategies using PMV and PPD indicators. As a single strategy, it was found that reducing infiltration of outside air was likely to be more effective than increasing the insulation level in the ceilings. The most successful strategy, however, was the creation of sunspaces at the entrances to the living rooms. This strategy increased average internal temperatures by 1. 7 and 2. 3 °C.
