50|$|Although the <b>car</b> <b>coat</b> was by now a {{familiar}} item, {{it did not}} mean it couldn't be reinvented. Michael Carr, who had designed an ergonomic racing suit for his company's co-director Stirling Moss applied first design principles to add functionality. Made of waterproofed poplin, his design of 1968 featured a zip front and separate velcro quick fasten strip. Buttons were designed so they didn't catch on the car seat belt, gathered cuffs excluded draughts and pockets were designed to fall on the knee while seated in the car. There was also an interior deep pocket for roadmaps. During the 1970s, the <b>car</b> <b>coat</b> {{continued to be a}} wardrobe staple for men, while <b>car</b> <b>coat</b> became a description of cut and length in women's fashion (often looser and always shorter than a traditional coat).|$|E
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, the <b>car</b> <b>coat</b> was {{an item of}} leisurewear, rather than simply a {{motoring}} accessory, and was being produced {{in a variety of}} fabrics, including sheepskin and the new manmade fur varieties. A fashion writer describing the uses of faux fur said: [...] "Apart from coats they are made into all kinds of leisure wear, of which the now ubiquitous <b>car</b> <b>coat</b> is a conspicuous example. Derived from the more expensive but still popular sheepskin jacket, it is usually made from a cotton suedette or brushed nylon outer fabric lined with an acrylic pile".|$|E

5000|$|From the 1980s on, the men's <b>car</b> <b>coat</b> {{started to}} symbolise a {{particular}} character or walk {{of life on}} British TV and in the press, especially when worn in sheepskin or camel hair. Sheepskin was the style favoured by Del Boy in Only Fools & Horses and by football managers. It was also worn by detectives in The Sweeney. Later, the Life on Mars detective series, in which the hero is transported back to the 1970s, would reprise the <b>car</b> <b>coat</b> by giving DCI Gene Hunt a scruffy version in camel wool. More celebrated still are the trademarked sheepskin car coats worn by BBC football commentator John Motson - he wore his first in 1972, acquired from a furrier he met {{at a party in}} Chelsea, and subsequently had them made on Savile Row. It had become such a shorthand description for British football pundits by the late 1990s that a Times feature about the warm-up for the 1998 World Cup began with the description: [...] "Paul Sexton, our man in the sheepskin <b>car</b> <b>coat,</b> on the tournament for the World Cup".|$|E
50|$|The {{immediate}} {{precursor to}} the postwar (modern) <b>car</b> <b>coat</b> was based around the jeep coat, a design popular in wartime for the drivers of open-topped vehicles. This was generally of a shorter length, ending at mid thigh.|$|E
5000|$|While women {{continued}} {{to wear the}} car-coat length - among others - by the mid 1960s the <b>car</b> <b>coat</b> had become a staple item of the male wardrobe. Editor of The Tailor and Cutter magazine John Taylor, writing in 1966, said: [...] "The riding mac was the equivalent in the nineteen twenties and thirties of the <b>car</b> <b>coat</b> of the nineteen fifties and sixties. If a riding mac was worn there was the suggestion {{that it had been}} bought for a specific purpose. The wearer probably owned a hack and therefore was {{not a member of the}} hoi polloi. For similar reasons today, however submerged in the psyches of their owners the reasons may lie, there are far more car coats in male wardrobes than there are cars in garages." ...|$|E

500|$|Raccoon fur <b>car</b> <b>coats</b> were {{a fashion}} {{trend in the}} 1920s, leading to high pelt prices and an {{increase}} in hunting and trapping. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, when many rural families lived in poverty, raccoons were hunted extensively and became relatively rare. Hunters sold the pelts for needed money, and the meat provided protein. In the 1940s and '50s conservation efforts were undertaken, including teaching hunters not to cut down den trees that raccoons used for raising offspring. The raccoon population subsequently expanded, {{to the point that they}} became recognized as a least-concern species.|$|R

5000|$|Warmth {{was still}} {{considered}} {{a key component}} of the <b>car</b> <b>coat,</b> with water-repellent poplin models with padded and quilted linings being designed for women as [...] "knock-about car coats". These came complete with detachable hoods and toggle fastenings. Fur was still being promoted for motorists, but as a prestige item to go with prestige cars. An advert from 1965 in The Times by the National Fur Company entitled [...] "An ocelot in your Jaguar" [...] said: [...] "We consider that an important feature of a <b>car</b> <b>coat</b> is its length - about halfway between a jacket and a 3/4 coat. At this length, it's comfortable to wear when driving. It doesn't ride up. Or 'seat'. And there is no risk of undue wear on the seat or back." ...|$|E
50|$|A <b>car</b> <b>coat</b> is {{an outer}} garment {{originally}} {{made to be}} worn by automobile drivers and passengers. First designed to provide maximum warmth and coverage, over time it became a much shorter garment. Today it describes a coat that typically ends at mid thigh. It is worn by both men and women.|$|E
5000|$|While fur, {{leather and}} heavy wool were {{preferred}} {{in the early}} days, today the coat may be made {{in a wide variety}} of materials. In the period after World War II, it took on design elements of the jeep coat worn by servicemen and this is when the shorter length became common. As car ownership grew so did the popularity of the coat; by the 1960s it was described as [...] "ubiquitous". The <b>car</b> <b>coat</b> remains popular today, both as a functional and a fashion garment.|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} {{to determine the}} average coating removal efficiency (ϵ) of Cynosure Cynergy Pulse Nd:YAG laser in paint removal has been developed on national and imported <b>car</b> <b>coated</b> substrates. This paper reports {{on the results of}} studies carried out on three types of different coating thicknesses ranging from 92 – 134 μm, 196 – 450 μm and 219 – 283 μm. Alicona IFM G 4 analysis was done to find the depth for each irradiated crater on three types of substrate samples using profilometer obtained. Depth (d) versus laser laser fluence (F) graph was plotted to determine the ϵ process for each substrate samples. This research paper proves the paint removal was increased with increasing of F but independence by manipulating the long pulse width (PW) and low range of repetition rate (RR). ...|$|R
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, some car coats were being {{designed}} in nylon, {{a report from}} the British Nylon Spinners' Fair in London in 1961 described a new washable mock suede <b>car</b> <b>coat</b> with brushed fleece nylon lining as: [...] "one of the good possibilities" [...] of the technology. Real leathers remained popular - showerproof suede models with detachable collars and large leather buttons were being designed for women by 1964. These were also in the shorter length, ending at mid thigh. Another new motoring design was the roebuck suede (deerskin) jacket, designed at hip length for both women and men, and described as a real innovation because: [...] "A suede upon which grease, alcohol, even motor oil has no effect is a find indeed." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{peculiar}} {{characteristic of}} his work is that the furniture, objects and interiors are based on used materials and reuse former or hidden functions of the recycled materials. The transformations are made with complex materials (industry), but also with cheap trash (packaging). The metamorphose of the materials should be useful and comfortable, surprising and make smile. His projects bring to the houses the sober beauty of industrial objects but simultaneously take profits from their former function: a spring damps weights (banc, office chair), a car seat has a good ergonomics (arm chair, sofa, reception room), a chain tracks and stays flexible (arm chair, bed, couch) and a supermarket trolley rolls and can be pushed together for storage (seat, child <b>car,</b> <b>coat</b> rack).

5000|$|Originally the <b>car</b> <b>coat</b> {{was more}} usually termed 'motoring dress'. It {{emerged in the}} early 1900s, when driving was {{considered}} an outdoor sport (most cars were open top) and required protective clothing. Clothing {{for men and women}} and for driver and passenger was relatively similar, comprising a long heavy coat. This was often in fur or lined with fur, although sometimes it was in heavy cloth. In summer, women would wear a duster coat, sometimes called a dust coat, to cover their garments, in a cloth such as linen or alpaca wool. This would be accessorised with gloves, goggles and a hat - women often wore elaborate hats and veils, while men would wear a cap. These accessories were worn year round. Motoring was still an activity for the elite, however the privations of driving in a vehicle that broke down frequently and provided no retreat from the elements, meant clothing had to be functional and warm. Sports motorist Dorothy Levitt - author of the 1909 handbook The Woman and the Car and dubbed 'the fastest woman on earth' for her 'scorching' (speeding) antics round tracks such as Brooklands - provided useful tips for women drivers on what to wear, along with guidance about the mechanical aspects of driving. On choosing the right coat, she said: [...] "Under no circumstance wear lace or fluffy adjuncts to your toilet. There is nothing like a thick frieze, homespun or tweed coat lined with fur. Do not heed the cry, 'nothing like leather.' Leather coats do not wear gracefully." ...|$|E

Tartan plaids were fashionable in the early 1950s, and later plaids and checks of all types were worn, as were corduroy jackets with leather buttons and <b>car</b> <b>coats.</b> 49er jackets, originally worn by hunters, miners and lumberjacks, were a popular cold weather coat in America and Canada, and would later be adopted by the teenage surfer subculture. On the West Coast many guys, including Howard Hughes and Ricky from I Love Lucy, favoured two color gabardine Hollywood jackets with belts and Old West inspired detailing, often in black, white, cream, beige, burgundy, air force blue, mint green, sky blue, chocolate brown, dusky pink, or grey tweed cloth. Khaki-colored pants, called chinos, were worn for casual occasions. Bermuda shorts, often in madras plaid, appeared in mid-decade and were worn with knee socks. Hawaiian shirts, worn untucked from suspenders, also became widely popular during this era. This summer fashion of the Hawaiian or Carioca shirt became particularly popular in America, with even President Truman being photographed wearing a marine flora shirt.
