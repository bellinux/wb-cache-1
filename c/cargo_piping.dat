50|$|The four {{ships of}} this design were built {{to prove the}} {{practicality}} of the Kam-e-Wa variable pitch propellor system in high SHP applications. Although the system did function well the high initial and subsequent maintenance costs associated with having two 20,000 HP B&W diesel engines, together with the inferior steel used for the <b>cargo</b> <b>piping,</b> compounded by the depressed tanker market at the time, meant that they were never viable economically.|$|E
50|$|Although {{replacement}} of the midsection was the single largest change in the $15,000,000 process, many other important improvements were made during the conversion. A major modification was made to the stern, including a new counterbalanced rudder, new stern casting and struts, and new shorter propeller shafts and stern tubes. The latest in fueling and replenishment at sea equipment was also added, including kingposts with outriggers, ram tensioned span wires and high lines, electric hydraulic winches, cargo elevators, helicopter pickup area, and sliding blocks and cargo drop reels at replenishment stations. New electric pumps, larger <b>cargo</b> <b>piping,</b> and double-hose fueling rigs were also added, {{as well as a}} 4,500-kilowatt auxiliary diesel generator plant, and more enclosed stowage space. Habitability was also improved.|$|E
2500|$|By {{actuating}} cargo valves, {{the person}} in charge can control where cargo is pumped from, where it is pumped to, and in systems that use throttle valves, can control the relative flow rates of cargo through the valves. [...] Modern cargo control rooms allow {{the person in}} charge to remotely control {{some or all of}} the valves in the cargo system and monitor the state of all valves. [...] Valve indicators are typically laid out on a [...] "mimic panel" [...] which displays the <b>cargo</b> system <b>piping,</b> valves and pumps in a schematic diagram.|$|R
50|$|Each T3 has {{emergency}} {{life rafts}} {{on the boat}} deck. The ships have <b>cargo</b> booms and <b>piping</b> to load and unload fuel. During wartime, the T3 ships were armed for protection with deck guns. A typical ship may have one single 3"/50 dual purpose gun, two 40 mm guns and three single Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. T3 ships normally carries 81 to 304 crew members. If operating as a United States Merchant Marine ship, the crew would be a mix of civilian Merchant Marines and United States Navy Armed Guards to man the deck guns.|$|R
25|$|Others {{point to}} The Glückauf, another design of Colonel Swan, {{as being the}} first modern oil tanker. It adopted the best {{practices}} from previous oil tanker designs to create the prototype for all subsequent vessels of the type. It was the first dedicated steam-driven ocean-going tanker {{in the world and}} was the first ship in which oil could be pumped directly into the vessel hull instead of being loaded in barrels or drums. It was also the first tanker with a horizontal bulkhead, its features included cargo valves operable from the deck, <b>cargo</b> main <b>piping,</b> a vapor line, cofferdams for added safety, and the ability to fill a ballast tank with seawater when empty of cargo. The ship was built in Britain and was purchased by Wilhelm Anton Riedemann, an agent for the Standard Oil Company along with several of her sister ships. After the Glückauf was lost in 1893 after being grounded in fog, Standard Oil purchased the sister ships.|$|R

Tank level monitoring is another key functionality often provided in modern cargo control rooms. [...] One aspect of tank level monitoring is overfill alarms, which sound throughout the ship when cargo levels exceed the ship's design specifications. [...] Many systems allow the person in charge to monitor tank levels at all tank levels. Tank level monitoring allows the person in charge to take early action to avoid oil spills, especially when loading the ship. [...] Tank level information is often sent to computers that calculate hull stresses such as shear forces and bending moments.|$|R
5000|$|The T1 tanker or T1 are a {{class of}} sea worthy small tanker ships used to {{transport}} fuel oil before and during World War II, Korean War and Vietnam War. The T1 tanker classification is still in use today. T1 tankers are about 200 to 250 feet in length {{and are able to}} sustain a top speed of about 12 knots. The hull designation AO is used by the US Navy to denote the ship is a T1 oil tanker and AOG that the T1 is a gasoline tanker. The small size allows the T1 to enter just about any sea port or to anchor around a small island, this was very useful during the Pacific War. The T1 tanker can carry about 48,000 to 280,000 BBLs. Some T1 tankers were used to transport goods other than oil, a few were used for black oil-crude oil, diesel, chemicals and rarely bulk cargo like grain. T1 tankers are also called liquid cargo carriers. The T1 tanker has about a 6,000 to 35,000 DWT of cargo. The small size also gives the ships short turn around time for repair, cleaning, loading and unloading. A T1 tanker carrying dirty cargo, like crude oil needs a few weeks of labor to clean before carrying clean cargo. Most T1 ships during World War II were named after major oil fields. [...] T1 tanker are operated by the US Navy, War Shipping Administration and United States Maritime Commission. Some T1 were loaned to England in the Lend-Lease program for World War II, after the war most were returned to the USA. After World War II many of the T1 ships were sold to for civilian use. Each T1 had emergency life rafts on the boat deck. The ships had <b>cargo</b> booms and <b>piping</b> to load and unload fuel. During war time the T1 are armed for protection with deck guns. A typical ship may have one single 3"/50 dual purpose gun, two 40 mm guns and three single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. A T1 at war time normally had a crew of 38 and up to 130. If operating as a United States Merchant Marine ship, the crew would be a mix of civilian Merchant Marines and United States Navy Armed Guards to man the guns.|$|R
