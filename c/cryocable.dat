As useful cost-comparisons can only be done on optimised systems, studies on system-optimisation are most important. Calculations on the optimal temperature of the <b>cryocable</b> give the result, {{that there is a}} minimum of the costs of power loss (incl. investment-costs of the pefrigerators) around 25 K, but the complication of the conductors caused by the necessity of reducing skinand proximity-effect resul t in a displacement and nearly total elimination of the optimum. The costs of current-transportcannot be effectively lowered by deep cooling. The optimistic cost data of cryocables reported in the literature may be explained by the following arguments: - insulation of high-voltage can be done easier at low temperatures and allows a simpler design of the cable. - the power-limit of cryocables is much higher comparedwith conventional cables, thus the degression of specific cost typical for all types of cables can be utilizied. Some further criterions may be added which are not analysed concerning the costs in detail, for example low with of the cable trench related to the power rating, good overload capability, adaption to the growing load with low costs by extension of the cooling-stations (this argument applies especially to the liquid nitrogen ($LN_{ 2 }$) -cable). As cooling with liquid hydrogen gives no substantial cost advantages, only the $LN_{ 2 }$-cable is treated further on because this will be an easier and more reliable system. Two typical and especially promising concepts are investigated in detail - a single conductor tube-cable, which is electrically and thermally insulated by vacuurn - a three-conductor cable with litz-type conductors which is insulated electrically by wrapped paper impregnated with $LN_{ 2 }$ and thermally by superinsulation under vacuum. The investment-costs and capitalized running costs related to the length and the transmitted power of the optimized systems are calculated at a nominal voltage of 110 kV and shown in dependence of power and length. Cable and cooling station can be devided in parallel independent units to increase the reliability of the system. The oncost of this provision is determined. By the following investigations on further details the results are refined and especially some unsafe points are examined more closely. As conclusion an economic comparison is done between the investigated types of a <b>cryocable</b> and an advanced normal-temperature-cable, that is an artificially cooled $SF_{ 6 }$-cable. As this is done on a uniform basis, the result will surely have a high reliability. The comparison shows, that the $LN_{ 2 }$-vacuum-tubecable is not competitive with the advanced $SF_{ 6 }$-tube-cable within the whole region of power investigated. The $LN_{ 2 }$-litz-conductor-cable on the other hand is able to cornpete when power and length are high. This is especially true, if it can be shown that the estimation of the frabrication costs of the conductor has been too pessimistic. Therefore experimental research on losses and fabrication problems of litz-conductors with high cross-sections are very important. The results of such investigations will be decisive on the good chances of a <b>cryocable</b> development...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to find out whether {{technical}} or economic aspects justify the development of cryoresistive cables. Naturally cooled cables will not be able to transmit the amounts of power that will be in the future in the congestion areas. The installation of overhead lines or parallel conventional cables will not be possible because of the growing lack of space for the cable trenches. Consequently, the development of advanced-power-cables should already be started now. The solution of the problem, whether the use of a cable, especially of a <b>cryocable,</b> is technically and economically justified, depends on the construction of the cable, on the materials which are used, and on the cooling machinery. For economic reasons aluminium or perhaps copper will be the preferred material for the conductors. Thecooling liquid can be practically only liquid nitrogen. The study discusses six kinds of electrical insulations, three variations of the flow of the cooling medium, two possibilities for the arrangement of electrical and thermal insulation and some kinds of conductor constructions. Altogether there are 504 theoretical conceivable cable concepts. Taking certain selection criteria as basis, three principal concepts which promise the most success have been selected from these concepts. By furthervariation three definite cable concepts are obtained for one of the solutions, so that totally in this study five cable concepts are discussed in detail. The two cryocables which have been under development in the USA for some years now are included in these concepts. At a nominal voltage of 110 kV and 15 km distance between thecooling stations the limit is about 1000 to 1500 MVA, at 380 kV and the same distance about 4000 to 5000 MVA. At smaller distances the power limits are correspondingly higher. In addition for each <b>cryocable</b> concept the transmission costs per km cable length and per MVA power rating are determined in variation with the diameter of the cable, the distance between cooling stations and the transmitted power. The formula used for the costs takes into account the capital cost of the cable, termination and fitting costs, including installation, civil engineering, cooling stations and costs of power losses, i. e. the costs for the electrical losses in thecable and the energy costs for the cooling stations. All the costs are determined according to uniform criteria. The used cost-formula allows for the standard utility-load. The results show that at maximum load the capital costs of the cooling stations and the costs of power-losses yield the biggest contribution to the total costs. Whereas the cost of the cable itself can be determined relatively accurately, there are greater uncertainties with respect to the capital cost and the efficiency of the cooling stations because plants have not yet been built for such an application. The accuracy of the calculated transmission costs is therefore determined on the basis of these uncertainties. In order to make a comparison with conventional cables, the costs of conventional cables buried directly and in cooling-water-ducts were computed with the same formulas and the same assumptions as for cryocables. The limits of power tx'ansmission-capability and the transmission costs fo cryocables and conventional cables that have been found are in close agreement with the corresponding data which are cited in a recently published study of A. D. Little entitled"Underground Power Transmission". Within the accuracy which is nowadays possible in such a calculation it is found that all the five cable concepts can competewith the present cable systems. The following advantages may be important for the justification of the development of cryocables: the width of the cable trench related to the power rating is considerably less compared with conventional cables (see Fig. 8. 1) - by stepswise uprating of the installed cooling-stations the transmission capability can be adapted to the growing demand. - a multiplication of the transmission-capability is possible, if more cooling stations are installed in thecourse of the line. even operating at the maximum continous load, a <b>cryocable</b> can sustain a substantially higher short-time overload compared to a conventional cable because of its high heat capacity. Although we expect no unsurmöuntable obstacles in the development of the cable concept which are considered to be promising, some important problems have to be solved, for example, the design of the electrical insulation, favourable construction of the conductor, shielding and piping for low eddy current losses and so on (see chapter 4. 2. 8). The data worked out in this study show that the cross-sections of cryocables will be large compared to conventional cables...|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a 66 -channel SQUID system to read out the detectors for {{the second phase of}} the CRESST dark matter search using SQUID sensors, electronics and <b>cryocables</b> supplied by different manufacturers. The system has been extensively tested at Oxford to characterise the sensitivity, bandwidth, slew rate, noise, thermal drift, and crosstalk. By using the SQUID sensors as magnetometers we can confirm the input circuit for the detectors is superconducting, thus ensuring there will be no noise from parasitic resistance. Multichannel SQUID systems have further applications in particle physics experiments, such as precision magnetometry in the search for the neutron electric dipole moment. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{frequency}} {{at which}} a large space telescope’s (e. g. NGST’s) detector chips are read, or the sample rate, is tightly coupled to many hardware and operational aspects of the telescope’s instrument and data handling elements. In this paper we discuss many of the drivers and important implications of the sample rate: the data rate to the ground; onboard computer storage, bandwidth, and speed; the number of A→D chips, and therefore the overall size and power requirements of the analog electronics; <b>cryocabling</b> requirements; and detector noise and power. We discuss and parametrize these and other elements related to sample rate. Finally, we discuss the implications of sample rate {{in the context of}} achieving the most important science goals under the constraint of limited cost. 1...|$|R
40|$|Vacuum {{insulation}} with cylindrical {{ceramic spacer}} insulators {{has been studied}} with respect to changes of its ac flashover voltage with time. The distributions of times to failure, which were found to confirm Weibull's distribution, were used for plotting the regression curves for times up to 350 h. The results show that even at rather low stresses the flashover voltage decreased in time. This phenomenon is connected with the recorded deposition of metal particles from the electrodes {{on the surface of}} the spacers during the tests. This possibility of the decrease of the flashover voltage, induced by the deconditioning effects of contaminating conducting particles generated under the working stress by the system itself, must be taken into account when considering the suitableness of using special means of increasing the short-time flashover voltage of vacuum insulation for <b>cryocables...</b>|$|R
