5|$|Production {{methods for}} the {{elements}} less frequently recognised as metalloids involve natural processing, electrolytic or <b>chemical</b> <b>reduction,</b> or irradiation. Carbon (as graphite) occurs naturally and is extracted by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite to the surface. Aluminium is extracted by dissolving its oxide Al2O3 in molten cryolite Na3AlF6 {{and then by}} high temperature electrolytic reduction. Selenium is produced by roasting the coinage metal selenides X2Se (X = Cu, Ag, Au) with soda ash to give the selenite: X2Se + O2 + Na2CO3 → Na2SeO3 + 2 X + CO2; the selenide is neutralized by sulfuric acid H2SO4 to give selenous acid H2SeO3; this is reduced by bubbling with SO2 to yield elemental selenium. Polonium and astatine are produced in minute quantities by irradiating bismuth.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{black is}} used as the black pigment in {{printing}} ink, artist's oil paint and water colours, carbon paper, automotive finishes, India ink and laser printer toner. Carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds. Activated charcoal {{is used as}} an absorbent and adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks, water purification, and kitchen extractor hoods, and in medicine to absorb toxins, poisons, or gases from the digestive system. Carbon is used in <b>chemical</b> <b>reduction</b> at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). Case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium, are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make {{up most of the}} materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather, and almost all of the interior surfaces in the built environment other than glass, stone and metal.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids can {{be obtained}} by <b>chemical</b> <b>reduction</b> of either their oxides or their sulfides. Simpler or more complex extraction methods may be employed depending on the starting form and economic factors. Boron is routinely obtained by reducing the trioxide with magnesium: B2O3 + 3 Mg → 2 B + 3MgO; after secondary processing the resulting brown powder has a purity of up to 97%. Boron of higher purity (> 99%) is prepared by heating volatile boron compounds, such as BCl3 or BBr3, either in a hydrogen atmosphere (2 BX3 + 3 H2 → 2 B + 6 HX) or to the point of thermal decomposition. Silicon and germanium are obtained from their oxides by heating the oxide with carbon or hydrogen: SiO2 + C → Si + CO2; GeO2 + 2 H2 → Ge + 2 H2O. Arsenic is isolated from its pyrite (FeAsS) or arsenical pyrite (FeAs2) by heating; alternatively, it {{can be obtained}} from its oxide by reduction with carbon: 2 As2O3 + 3 C → 2 As + 3 CO2. Antimony is derived from its sulfide by reduction with iron: Sb2S3 → 2 Sb + 3 FeS. Tellurium is prepared from its oxide by dissolving it in aqueous NaOH, yielding tellurite, then by electrolytic reduction: TeO2 + 2 NaOH → Na2TeO3 + H2O; Na2TeO3 + H2O → Te + 2 NaOH + O2. Another option is reduction of the oxide by roasting with carbon: TeO2 + C → Te + CO2.|$|E

25|$|The {{invention}} of the silvered-glass mirror is credited to German chemist Justus von Liebig in 1835. His process involved the deposition of {{a thin layer of}} metallic silver onto glass through the <b>chemical</b> <b>reduction</b> of silver nitrate. This silvering process was adapted for mass manufacturing and led to the greater availability of affordable mirrors. In the modern age, mirrors are often produced by the wet deposition of silver, or sometimes nickel or chromium (the latter used most often in automotive mirrors) via electroplating directly onto the glass substrate.|$|E
25|$|Compression fossils, such {{as those}} of fossil ferns, are the result of <b>chemical</b> <b>reduction</b> of the complex organic {{molecules}} composing the organism's tissues. In this case the fossil consists of original material, albeit in a geochemically altered state. This chemical change is an expression of diagenesis. Often what remains is a carbonaceous film known as a phytoleim, in which case the fossil is known as a compression. Often, however, the phytoleim is lost and all that remains is an impression of the organism in the rock—an impression fossil. In many cases, however, compressions and impressions occur together. For instance, when the rock is broken open, the phytoleim will often be attached to one part (compression), whereas the counterpart will just be an impression. For this reason, one term covers the two modes of preservation: adpression.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} antiquity, an {{unexpected}} {{exception to the}} alteration of an organism's tissues by <b>chemical</b> <b>reduction</b> of the complex organic molecules during fossilization has been the discovery of soft tissue in dinosaur fossils, including blood vessels, and the isolation of proteins and evidence for DNA fragments. In 2014, Mary Schweitzer and her colleagues reported the presence of iron particles (goethite-aFeO(OH)) associated with soft tissues recovered from dinosaur fossils. Based on various experiments that studied the interaction of iron in haemoglobin with blood vessel tissue they proposed that solution hypoxia coupled with iron chelation enhances the stability and preservation of soft tissue and provides the basis for {{an explanation for the}} unforeseen preservation of fossil soft tissues. However, a slightly older study based on eight taxa ranging in time from the Devonian to the Jurassic found that reasonably well-preserved fibrils that probably represent collagen were preserved in all these fossils, and that the quality of preservation depended mostly on the arrangement of the collagen fibers, with tight packing favoring good preservation. There seemed to be no correlation between geological age and quality of preservation, within that timeframe.|$|E

500|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{operate on}} the principle of <b>chemical</b> <b>reduction</b> whereby carbon monoxide, having a stronger affinity for the oxygen in iron ore than iron does, reduces the iron to its elemental form. [...] Blast furnaces differ from bloomeries and reverberatory furnaces in that in a blast furnace, flue gas is in direct contact with the ore and iron, allowing carbon monoxide to diffuse into the ore and reduce the iron oxide to elemental iron mixed with carbon. [...] The blast furnaces operates as a countercurrent exchange process whereas a bloomery does not. Another difference is that bloomeries operate as a batch process while blast furnaces operate continuously for long periods because they are difficult to start up and shut down. (See: Continuous production) [...] Also, the carbon in pig iron lowers the melting point below that of steel or pure iron; in contrast, iron does not melt in a bloomery.|$|E

40|$|Iron oxy(hydr) oxides (oxides) are {{important}} mercury sinks in tropical oxisols and the geochemistry {{of these two}} elements are thus closely entwined. We hypothesized that bacterial Fe-oxide reduction in anoxic conditions could be a significant mechanism for mobilizing associated Hg. Iron oxide and mercury solubilisation in presence of two chemical reducers (ascorbate and dithionite, dissolving amorphous and amorphous plus well crystallized Fe-oxides, respectively) was compared to their solubilisation in presence of autochthonous ferri-reducing bacteria. This work was carried out on two soil profiles from a small catchment basin in French Guyana, an oxisol (O) from a well drained slope and a water-saturated hydromorphic soil (H). The <b>chemical</b> <b>reductions</b> showed that in the oxisol 20 and 48 % of total Hg (HgT) was associated to amorphous and well crystallized iron oxides, respectively. However, in the hydromorphic soil, no Hg seemed to be associated to amorphous iron oxides while the well crystallized fraction contained less than 9 % of HgT. <b>Chemical</b> Fe-oxide <b>reduction</b> showed that Hg solubility was correlated to Fe reduction in the oxisol, demonstrating {{a relationship between the}} geochemistry of these two metals. During bacterial growth, while bacterial iron reduction solubilised up to 3. 2 mg Fe g- 1 soil in the oxisol sample, HgT remained unchanged. No mercury was detected in the culture medium either.
