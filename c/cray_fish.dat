6000|$|Those kinds {{which include}} no other subdivisions than the sexes, or various breeds, are called, in {{technical}} language, species. The English lobster is a species, our <b>cray</b> <b>fish</b> is another, our prawn is another. In other countries, however, there are lobsters, <b>cray</b> <b>fish,</b> and prawns, very like ours, and yet presenting sufficient differences to deserve distinction. Naturalists, therefore, express this resemblance and this diversity by grouping them as distinct {{species of the}} same [...] "genus." [...] But the lobster and the <b>cray</b> <b>fish,</b> though belonging to distinct genera, have many features in common, and hence are grouped together in an assemblage which is called a family. More distant resemblances connect the lobster with the prawn and the crab, which are expressed by putting all these into the same order. Again, more remote, but still very definite, resemblances unite the lobster with the woodlouse, the king crab, the water flea, and the barnacle, and separate them from all other animals; whence they collectively constitute the larger group, or class, Crustacea. But the Crustacea exhibit many peculiar features in common with insects, spiders, and centipedes, so that these are grouped into the still larger assemblage or [...] "province" [...] Articulata; and, finally, the relations which these have to worms and other lower animals, are expressed by combining the whole vast aggregate into the sub-kingdom of Annulosa.|$|E
60|$|These are {{wonderful}} truths, {{the more so}} because the zoologist finds them to be of universal application. The investigation of a polype, of a snail, of a fish, of a horse, or of a man, would have led us, though by a less easy path, perhaps, to exactly the same point. Unity of plan everywhere lies hidden under the mask of diversity of structure--the complex is everywhere evolved out of the simple. Every animal has at first {{the form of an}} egg, and every animal and every organic part, in reaching its adult state, passes through conditions common to other animals and other adult parts; and this leads me to another point. I have hitherto spoken as if the lobster were alone in the world, but, as I need hardly remind you, there are myriads of other animal organisms. Of these, some, such as men, horses, birds, fishes, snails, slugs, oysters, corals, and sponges, are not in the least like the lobster. But other animals, though they may differ a good deal from the lobster, are yet either very like it, or are like something that is like it. The <b>cray</b> <b>fish,</b> the rock lobster, and the prawn, and the shrimp, for example, however different, are yet so like lobsters, that a child would group them as of the lobster kind, in contradistinction to snails and slugs; and these last again would form a kind by themselves, in contradistinction to cows, horses, and sheep, the cattle kind.|$|E

Antioxidants may be important in delaying the onset of the complications. The current work reports the effect of an antioxidant rich nutriceutical on serum lipid profile and antioxidant status of alloxan induced diabetic rats. The nutriceutical was prepared from onions, garlic, lemon, palm oil and <b>Cray</b> <b>fish</b> in ratio 6 : 6 : 2 : 1 : 5 respectively. The nutriceutical was administered orally to diabetic rats(wister strains) age ≥ 4 months for three weeks with and without treatment with metformin. Twenty four (24) hours after the last administration, blood samples were collected from the rats by cardiac puncture following anaesthesia in chloroform vapour. The effect of supplementation on serum levels of glucose, lipid profile, malondialdehyde, glutathione peroxidase, Cu, Mn, Zn, vitamins A, C and E were assessed. The results indicated that supplementation with the nutriceutical significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced serum levels of glucose, malondialdehyde, cholesterol, triglyceride and atherogenic index. Supplementation also increased the serum levels of glutathione peroxidase activity, Zn, Cu, Mn, vitamins and HDL-cholesterol significantly (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Endocrine {{disruption}} is {{a complex}} phenomenon {{in the sense that}} endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are known to act via multiple modes of action, but the mechanisms of actions are poorly understood. In crustaceans, calcium (Ca 2 +) apart from its role as a second messenger, is also a major constituent of the calcified exoskeleton which undergoes a periodic mineralization/demineralization process known as the molting cycle. Molt cycle is under the control of steroid hormones, ecdysteroids. EDCs disrupt this molting process via their interference with receptor-mediated ecdysteroid signaling. However, the hormonal regulation of Ca 2 + flux in crustacean molting is poorly understood. Cyclic nucleotides -cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and/or cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) -play an important role in ecdysteroidogenesis {{as well as in the}} regulation of Ca 2 + transporters. These three components -nuclear receptors, cyclic nucleotides and Ca 2 + transporters -are seemingly inter-connected, and can be affected by endocrine disruption. I investigated a mechanistic pathway involving these three components in the crustacean endocrine disruption in freshwater crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. I selected 17 α-ethinyl-estradiol (EE 2, a synthetic estrogen) and 17 β-estradiol (E 2, a natural estrogen) as model EDCs. We determined the expression profiles of i) nuclear estrogen receptors (EcR: Ecdysone Receptor; RXR: Retinoid X Receptor), ii) cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP), and iii) Ca 2 + transporters (SERCA: Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase; CaM: Calmodulin; and PMCA: Plasma Membrane Ca 2 +-ATPase) in the hepatopancreatic cells of P. clarkii. Finally, we determined the chitinase (Chi) gene expression to substantiate our findings, as Chi expression represents the terminal events in ecdysteroid signaling. During the molt cycle of P. clarkii, all three components were differentially expressed. Significant upregulation of nuclear estrogen receptors, cyclic nucleotides, and Ca 2 + transporters was observed in the presence of environmentally relevant concentrations (100 ng/L and 500 ng/L) of EE 2 and E 2. Chi expression was significantly higher during postmolt stage, and when <b>cray</b> were <b>fish</b> exposed to E 2 and EE 2. Understanding the roles of these three components in a natural molt cycle will provide insights about pathways associated with ecdysteroid signaling. Determining the effects of EDCs on these components will aid in understanding the mechanisms behind the disruption of this signaling...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the efficiency of diets containing various levels of calcium(0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 percentage) in feeding freshwater crayfish, Astacus leptoductylus. 150 <b>cray</b> <b>fish</b> (10 individuals per tank) with mean weight of about 8 - 9 gram were stocked in each of 15 tanks, containing 100 L of water. In this research, The results showed that the mean values of some parameters such as weight gain (WG), weight increment rate (WIR), length increment rate (LIR), specific growth rate (SGR), biomass increment (BI), food efficiency rate (FER) and survival rate (SR) of animal fed on different diets were 0. 75 - 1. 46 gr, 9. 8 - 24. 54 %, 6. 57 - 15. 33 % and 0. 12 - 0. 29 % respectively. However, the diet with high levels of calcium (3 - 4 %) showed the good weight and length increment, but there were no significants difference among these indices using different trial diets. The biomass of crayfish increased with increasing of calcium concentration. So, the highest biomass (11. 65 gr) of crayfish was observed in the diet containing calcium about 4 %. Optimal calcium requirement in the freshwter crayfish was estimated about 3. 4 % with broken-line regression analysis. The lowest survival rate (30 %) was obtained in the diet containing 2 % calcium level. There were significant differences among survival rates in various experimental diets (p&lt; 0. 05). These results indicate that the dietary calcium supplement is nesessary for crayfish. The diets with high levels of calcium had a good efficiency in freshwater crayfish feeding. So it is recommended to use 3 - 3. 5 % of calcium in formulated diets for freshwater crayfis...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of genotoxic substances in river {{water is a}} serious problem because of their risk for both human and ecosystem health. Although numerous test methods for the genotoxicological testing of water samples are described in the literature from Germany and abroad, no sound experience has been gained as to whether the test systems hitherto used are sufficiently sensitive and suited for routine use. Therefore, a research project was designed to develop a test strategy for the detection and evaluation of genotoxic effects in surface water aquatic organisms. Indicator tests were evaluated with respect to their predictive power, sensitivity an practicability in order to determine whether they are suitable for inclusion in a battery of tests. The bioassays utilized in this study include the umu-test, alkaline filter elution (mussels, green algae), the DNA unwinding test (fish larvae, <b>cray</b> <b>fish,</b> mussels, fish cell lines), the comet assay (protozoans, green algae, mussels, primary fish hepatocytes, fish and mammalian cell lines) and the UDS-test (primary fish hepatocytes). The Ames Salmonella assay, a direct genotoxicity assay and a well-known base test in chemicals assessment, was included in the study programme for comparison. (orig.) assays. The test- and substance-specific sensitivity thresholds were determined. In a simplified interlaboratory trial 4 non-spiked and genotoxin-spiked surface water samples from the river Weisse Elster (doted genotoxin: a Gentox mixture based on 4 -NQO) were tested with the assays with the result that reproducible dose-effect relationships have been shown. In a second phase of the project the validated methods were applied to nonconcentrated samples of surface water taken on a monthly basis from the river Rhine, the Wahnbach dam, the rivers Elbe and Mulde over a period of 12 months {{as well as from the}} river Wupper and a gasworks site. This allowed temporal and spatial variations to be identified over a relatively long period of time. Chemical profile analyses were carried out on all samples to identify genotoxic contaminants, but the chemical data generated did not reflect the genotoxic effects found by the biological methods. The data obtained showed the comet assay, the umu-test and the Ames-test to be particularly sensitive and to detect genotoxic effects in complex mixtures in a low dose range. They seem to be suitable for routine testing and should therefore be used in the first stage of a graduated testing battery for detectionof gentoxicity in surfaceSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 00 B 946 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Bildung und Forschung (BMBF), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|E
40|$|EXTENDED ABSTRACT For {{the first}} time, the Dolenjska museum Novo mesto {{provided}} access to digitised museum resources {{when they took}} the decision to enrich the exhibition Novo mesto 1848 - 1918 by adding digital content. The following goals were identified: the digital content was created {{at the time of}} exhibition planning and design, it met the needs of different age groups of visitors, and during the exhibition the content was accessible via touch screen. As such, it also served for educational purposes (content-oriented lectures) or problem solving team work. In the course of exhibition digital content was accessible on the museum website [URL] The digital content was divided into the following sections: the web photo gallery, the quiz and the game. The photo gallery was designed {{in the same way as}} the exhibition and the print catalogue and extended by the photos of contemporary Novo mesto and accompanied by the music from the orchestron machine. The following themes were outlined: the Austrian Empire, the Krka and Novo mesto, the town and its symbols, images of the town and people, administration and economy, social life and Novo mesto today followed by digitised archive materials and sources from that period such as the Commemorative book of the Uniformed Town Guard, the National Reading Room Guest Book, the Kazina guest book, the album of postcards and the Diploma of Honoured Citizen Josip Gerdešič. The Web application was also a tool for a simple and on line selection of digitised material and the creation of new digital content which proved to be much more convenient for lecturing than Power Point presentations. The quiz consisted of 40 questions relating to the exhibition theme and the catalogue. Each question offered a set of three answers only one of them being correct and illustrated by photography. The application auto selected ten questions and valued the answers immediately. The quiz could be accessed individually or in a group of visitors as a quick test at the end of a visit to the exhibition. The computer game <b>Cray</b> <b>Fish</b> Hunting on the River of Krka was tailored to young visitors. It described the geographical position of Novo mesto on the Krka peninsula and some objects on the riverside (wooden baths, the old bridge, the dam and the mill). Hunting noble cray-fish was very extensive in the Novo mesto region until the outburst of the cray-fish plague. It is said that up to 100, 000 cay fish were caught annually and transported to all major towns of the then Austrian Empire. The original museum collections were preserved by scanning precious items which were kept in depots. Digitised materials accessible on the museum website met the needs of the majority of users and provided expanded access to the museum collection through presentation of graphic materials in virtual exhibition on the web which was much more comprehensive than a printed catalogue. There was also the possibility of remote access to the museum website which was very important for tourists and museum visitors with special needs. It was possible to design customer tailored presentations on specific themes (postcards from the period of national awakening, local societies, middle class garments etc.). Digital content was also available to school teachers to discuss the themes of interest with their pupils or students either before or after visiting the exhibition. There are many pitfalls and limitations of digitisation, the biggest two being staff deficiency and shrinking budget. Furthermore, there are difficulties with the technical support, gathering information on the implementation process, seeking partners to digitise materials etc. Besides, the question of long term digital archiving is of vital importance. </p...|$|E
