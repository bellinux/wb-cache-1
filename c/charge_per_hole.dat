40|$|The {{research}} work examines {{the effects of}} controllable blasting variables on number of boulders generated after blasting. The objective of the research was achieved through collection of data related to blasting which are drill hole depth, drill hole diameter, burden, spacing, average <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> <b>hole,</b> and specific charge. The collected data were analysed statistically using both Microsoft Excel Software and SPSS Software. The result of the analysis reveals that all the input controllable blasting variables which are drill hole diameter (X 1), drill hole depth (X 2), hole spacing (X 3), burden (X 4), average <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> <b>hole</b> (X 5), specific charge(X 6) that participated as independent variables in the models {{are found to be}} significant and the R 2 values obtained from the graph show a very strong correlation between the number of boulders generated after blasting and the input variables except that of drill hole diameter which shows a very weak correlation. The equation generated using the SPSS could be used to determine number of boulders generated after blasting. </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} examines optimization of blasting {{parameters for}} economic production of granite aggregates in Ratcon and NSCE quarries located at Ibadan, Oyo State. Samples {{were collected from}} the study areas for the determination of rock density and porosity. Schmidt hammer was used for in situ determination of rock hardness. Uniaxial compressive strength of in situ rock was estimated from the values obtained from Schmidt hammer rebound hardness test and density determined from laboratory test. Blasting {{data were collected from}} the study areas for optimization. Multiple regression analysis using computer aided solution SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) was used to analyse data ob-tained from the laboratory test, field test and the study areas. The estimated mean uniaxial compressive strength value of NSCE is 240 MPa and that of Ratcon is 200 MPa and their average densities and average porosities are 2. 63 g/cm 3, 2. 55 g/cm 3, 1. 88 % and 2. 25 % respectively. Eleven parameters were input into the multiple regression analysis to gener-ate the models. Two parameters out of eleven input parameters such as geometric volume of blast (Y 1) and number of boulders generated after blasting (Y 2) were dependent variables and the remaining nine such as X 1 (Drill hole diameter), X 2 (Drill hole depth), X 3 (Spacing), X 4 (Burden), X 5 (Average <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> <b>hole),</b> X 6 (Rock density), X 7 (Porosity), X 8 (Uniaxial compressive strength) and X 9 (Specific charge) were input as independent variables.

40|$|At the Ukhaa Khudag (UHG) coal mine, {{working part}} of the Tavan Tolgoi {{formation}} located in the southern Gobi desert of Mongolia, there have been minor to moderate slope failures in locations of relatively shallow overall slope angles. The majority of these events {{have been due to}} sliding along bedding plane shear zones that are generally associated with the coal seams. The bedding plane shears have low cohesion and friction angles. For economic reasons not all seams are mined progressively down dip from the base of weathering, leaving some coal and overburden in situ up dip of the excavation. A solution is required to enable slopes to be mined at a steeper angle than the strata dip dictates. Targeted buffer blasting has been trialled with encouraging results. Targeted buffer blasting is designed to disrupt identified plane(s) of weakness, disturbing them in order to increase cohesion and friction angle. The explosive <b>charge</b> weight <b>per</b> <b>hole</b> is generally significantly less than that used for a production hole of the same depth. Once exposed, the batter or slope will appear less damaged than it would in a normal buffer (or softwall) blast. A secondary advantage of buffer blasting is improved drainage, which lowers the phreatic surface. Seven individual targeted buffer blasts have been analysed of which four have been classified as successful, two were probably successful and one was unsuccessful. The unsuccessful case was probably influenced by a nearby major blast...|$|R

The most significant and positive correlations were obtained between leaf K × soil respiration, microbial biomass × leaf N and root Ca × metabolic quotient. The use of 160 kg ha- 1 N from cattle manure along with 160 kg ha- 1 N from pigeon pea shoots with two plants <b>per</b> <b>hole</b> resulted in a lower relative loss of C-CO 2; the same result was found for the treatment of two plants <b>per</b> <b>hole</b> fertilized with 160 kg ha- 1 N from cattle manure.

40|$|Drilling and {{blasting}} are {{the major}} unit operations in opencast mining. Inspite of the best efforts to introduce mechanization in the opencast mines, blasting continue to dominate the production. Therefore to cut down the cost of production optimal fragmentation from properly designed blasting pattern has to be achieved. Proper adoption of drilling and blasting can contribute significantly towards profitability and therefore optimization of these parameters is essential. Introduction Rock breaking by drilling and blasting is {{the first phase of}} the production cycle in most of the mining operations. Optimization of this operation is very important as the fragmentation obtained thereby affects the cost of the entire gamut of interrelated mining activities, such as drilling, blasting, loading, hauling, crushing and to some extent grinding. Optimization of rock breaking by drilling and blasting is sometimes understood to mean minimum cost in the implementation of these two individual operations. However, a minimum cost for breaking rock may not be in the best interest of the overall mining system. A little more money spent in the rock-breaking operation can be recovered later from the system and the aim of the coordinator of the mining work should be to achieve a minimum combined cost of drilling, blasting, loading, hauling, crushing and grinding. Only a “balance sheet” of total cost of the full gamut of mining operations vis-à-vis production achieved can establish whether the very first phase- rock breaking- was “optimum” financially; leaving aside factors of human safety. An optimum blast is also associated with the most efficient utilization of blasting energy in the rock- breaking process, reducing blasting cost through less explosive consumption and less wastage of explosive energy in blasting, less throw of materials, and reduction of blast vibration resulting in greater degrees of safety and stability to the nearby structures. Development of a Blast Optimization Model Selection of proper explosive in any blasting round is an important aspect of optimum blast design. Basic parameters include VOD of explosive (m/s), Density (g/cc), Characteristic impedance, Energy output (cal/gm), and Explosive type (ANFO, Slurry, Emulsion etc.). However, all these parameters can not be taken for optimizing the blasting method successfully. Some of the parameters are taken for minimizing the blasting cost. These cost reduction and optimum blast design parameter will give an economical result. The parameters are i. Drill hole diameter, ii. Powder factor (desired), iii. Cost of explosive, iv. Numbers of holes required to blast. Methodology The study of the various parameters of blasting suggests that the powder factor should be constant as per the requirement. The number of holes desired as per the explosive, the drill ihole diameter as available and the cost of explosive are kept as input. The spacing, bench height, burden, <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> <b>hole</b> as depending on the previous parameters can be calculated. From the different input and calculated parameters the total cost of the method is calculated and the least expensive method is selected as the optimized model. Blasting related information were collected from three different mines of Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. (MCL) for implementation of the optimization model. A program was designed using visual basic on. net platform taking the above parameters into consideration to select the optimized model. It was observed that the program gives satisfactory results. A sample output of the program is as presented below: Conclusion The blast optimization model has been developed with simple methodologies which can be adopted by the mining industry to compare the explosive costs and achieve better blasting results and. The model developed is a user friendly one, since by keeping the powder factor and number of choices of explosives available as constant and by varying the parameters like drill hole diameter, number of holes and cost of explosives one can compare the explosive performance and accordingly take a decision to select the proper type of explosives for blasting. It may be noted, that the model has been developed based on case studies of three different mines of MCL, and it can be modified with collection of information from a large number of mines.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether it is possible to reduce a <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> pulse, which is needed for selective nerve stimulation. Simulation is performed using a two-part simulation model: a volume conductor model to calculate the electrical potential distribution inside a tripolar cuff electrode and a human fiber model to simulate the fiber response to simulation. Selective stimulation is obtained by anodal block. To obtain anodal block of large fibers, long square pulses (> 350 μs) with a relatively high currents (1 - 2. 5 mA) are usually required. These pulses might not be safe for a long-term application because of a high <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> pulse. In this study, several pulse shapes are proposed that have less <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> pulse compared with the conventional square pulse and would therefore be safer in a chronic application. Compared with the conventional square pulse, it was possible to reduce the charge with all proposed pulse shapes, but the best results are obtained with a combination of a square depolarizing pulse and a blocking pulse. The <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> pulse was up to 32 % less with that pulse shape than with a square pulse. Using a hyperpolarizing anodal prepulse preceding a square pulse, it was not possible to block nerve fibers in a whole nerve bundle and to obtain reduction of a <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> phase. Reduction of the charge could be achieved only with spatially selective blocking.
