50|$|If {{short-term}} interest rates were expected to fall in a <b>contango</b> <b>market,</b> this would narrow the spread between a futures contract and an underlying asset in good supply. This is because the cost of carry will fall due to the lower interest rate, which in turn results in {{the difference between the}} price of the future and the underlying growing smaller (i.e. narrowing). An investor would be advised to buy the spread in these circumstances: this is a calendar spread trade where the trader buys the near-dated instrument and simultaneously sells the far-dated instrument (i.e. the future).|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} while a passive {{investment}} strategy going long in WTI oil futures yields an annual excess return of 8. 1 % between January 1985 and June 2010, an active but very simple investment strategy going long in backwardation markets (spot price above futures prices) and short in <b>contango</b> <b>markets</b> (spot price below futures prices) yields an annual excess return of 20 % {{for the same}} period. Its statistical significance is also high with a t-value of 3. 36 compared to the long only strategy with a t-value of only 1. 34. A supplementary investment strategy, where we leave the market for one month after a prior monthly negative return, yields an annual excess return of 22 % between 1985 and 2010. We also show that although the risk is relatively high in oil futures, investors with a perspective of more than 5 years made at least 12 % annually after June 1991. Investors entering the market in 2000 and in 2005 made respectively 24. 5 % and 22. 2 % annually. Between 1985 and 2004, backwardation markets {{account for more than}} 66 % of the months. In addition, returns are much higher during backwardation months than during contango months. After 2005, however, <b>contango</b> <b>markets</b> have become the norm in oil futures; yet, the excess return has remained high. Roll return, whether in backwardation <b>markets</b> or <b>contango</b> <b>markets</b> is a very stable and safe excess return and accounts for almost all the return compared to spot return. Several explanations have been put forward regarding the drivers of the return in commodity futures. No explanation seems to fully account for the high returns. However, we do show that risk premium is connected to hedging pressure where short hedgers and long speculators are the most volatile and seem to adjust their volume according to price changes...|$|R

Disadvantages of holding various gold investments are described, particularly in <b>Contango</b> <b>markets.</b> The gold prices are examined {{in the past two}} decades, focusing on the relationship with the S&P 500 and Dow index and various currencies, producer and consumer indices. We conclude with advice to potential individual investors in gold and an overview of some variables that affect the future trend of gold. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{rationale}} of the Optimum Yield {{technology was}} {{to address the}} dynamic nature of commodity forward curves. Unstable forward curves has meant the traditional approach employed by commodity indices, namely rolling futures contracts on a predefined scheduled (e.g. monthly) has, in our view, become an inferior strategy for passive commodity index investing. The DBLCI-OY indices are designed to select the futures contacts that either maximises the positive roll yield in backwardated term structures or minimises the negative roll yield in <b>contangoed</b> <b>markets</b> {{from the list of}} tradeable futures that expire in the next 13 months.|$|R
40|$|With {{the growth}} of {{alternative}} investment vehicles such as hedge funds and the resulting search for "new" asset classes, the interest in the commodity market has been growing within the financial sector. The commodity futures markets have been successfully providing a platform for investors and industrial participants as an alternative investment vehicle and a tool for risk management. The storable commodity futures markets are characterised by two distinct market conditions: backwardation and contango, which are directly linked to market fundamentals such as inventory levels and thus influence the price dynamics and functioning of the commodity futures market. While there exists {{a large body of}} {{research in the area of}} commodity derivatives, research on the linkage between market dynamics and the market conditions as determined by fundamentals is very limited. Accordingly, this thesis aims to investigate the different market dynamics of metal futures markets under these two conditions. The issues under examination include the futures price discovery function, the forecasting performance of the futures price, the long-run cost-of-carry equilibrium and short-run time-varying adjustment, and the price volatility and its relationship with inventory levels and trading volume. The empirical findings suggest, for the first time, that the price discovery function depends on the state of the storable commodity markets: futures prices are found to be upward biased predictors of the future spot prices when the market is in contango and are downward biased when the market is in backwardation. Nonparametric bootstrap simulations confirm that the forecast errors are negative in a backwardation market and are positive in a <b>contango</b> <b>market,</b> and moreover the forecast errors are larger under the former market condition than the latter. The empirical results also show that the price volatility is higher in a backwardation market than in a <b>contango</b> <b>market</b> as indicated by the negative relationship between price volatility and inventory levels. We also show that the spot volatility is generally higher than the futures price volatility and the difference is greater when the inventory level is low. Moreover, the impact of trading volume on the futures price volatility is found to be stronger when the market is in backwardation in some of the markets. In short, the empirical findings in this thesis suggest that the functioning of the metal spot and futures market is dependent on market conditions of which the inventory level is an important indictor as implied by the theory of storage. The empirical findings have strong implications for practitioners (particularly, trading houses, funds and banks) who could potentially form different trading strategies based on the distinct market behaviour under the two market conditions...|$|E
40|$|I {{have written}} about “the last {{contango}} in Washington ” before. The phrase covers the gold crisis that has been brewing under the surface {{in the world for}} the past sixty years due to the insane gold policies of the United States Treasury. As a result all newly mined gold, surpassing the quantity of all gold ever mined in the world prior to 1947, has gone into private hoards, from which it will be next to impossible to coax it out. The measure of this act of disappearance of gold is the vanishing of the basis, or the last contango. In the technical jargon of the futures markets the basis is the spread between the nearest futures price and the cash price in the same location. The gold market has always been a carrying-charge market, a. k. a. <b>contango</b> <b>market,</b> due to the monetary metal status of gold. This means that the gold spread has always reflected the carrying charge, or the opportunity cost of carrying gold, the lion’s share of which is foregone interest. But a very strange phenomenon has been manifesting itself during the past thirty-five years, since the inception of gold futures trading. The basis {{as a percentage of the}} rate of interest, rathe...|$|E
40|$|Using {{detailed}} data from three simultaneous surveys of producers, traders, and exporters, this paper examines {{the transmission of}} international coffee prices through the domestic value chain in Uganda. We find that producer price fluctuations are inconsistent with constant transaction costs. We investigate three possible explanations for this finding: storage and <b>contango,</b> <b>marketing</b> costs that increase with price, and trader entry that raises search time. We test and reject the storage and marketing costs explanation, but we find some evidence of trader entry {{in response to a}} rise in export price. Our findings suggest that small itinerant traders enter in response to an export price increase, probably taking advantage of farmers' ignorance of the rise in wholesale price...|$|R

5000|$|The {{strategy}} {{works because}} oil prices for delivery {{in the future}} are trading at a premium {{to those in the}} spot market - a market structure known in the industry as contango - with investors expecting prices to eventually recover from the near 60 percent slide in oil in the last seven months.

40|$|The {{on-going}} {{debate over}} the influence of investor demand on spot commodity prices largely attempts to assess this influence by measuring the growth in investor demand in recent years. Given the serious data problems that plague such analyses, this article pursues another approach {{in the hope of}} providing useful insights into the impact of investor demand on spot commodity prices. It focuses on the mechanisms by which investor demand affects spot prices, and in particular on two questions. First, how does an increase in investor demand on the futures markets affect the spot market and spot price? Second, when investor demand is increasing and pushing a commodity's price up, do physical stocks of the commodity also have to be rising, as economists and others widely assume? On the first question, the article concludes that a surge in investor demand raising prices on the futures markets will have a direct and comparable effect on the spot market prices when these markets are in strong <b>contango.</b> However, when <b>markets</b> are in weak contango or backwardation, price movements in the futures markets have a much looser effect on spot prices. As a result, changes in investor demand on the futures markets may have little or no influence on spot prices {{in the absence of a}} strong contango. Instead, changes in fundamentals (that is, producer supply and consumer demand) and possibly changes in investor demand taking place directly on the spot market largely determine the spot price at such times. On the second question, the article shows that investor demand can be pushing up a commodity's price even when investor stocks are falling, despite the widespread presumption to the contrary.
