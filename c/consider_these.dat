He argued that Chinese {{soldiers who had}} thrown away their uniforms were legally executed because {{the laws of war}} at the time did not apply to them, though this line of reasoning is hotly disputed by other historians. Most Japanese ultranationalists who deny the Nanking Massacre admit that the Japanese Army killed a large number of Chinese POWs, though they <b>consider</b> <b>these</b> to be legal executions, an argument denounced by mainstream historians.|$|E
5|$|Shaffer {{defined the}} Russula brevipes {{varieties}} acrior and megaspora in 1964 from Californian specimens. The former {{is characterized by}} a greenish-blue band that forms {{at the top of the}} stipe, while the latter variety has large spores. The nomenclatural database Index Fungorum does not <b>consider</b> <b>these</b> varieties to have independent taxonomical significance. In a 2012 publication, mycologist Mike Davis and colleagues suggest that western North American Russula brevipes comprise a complex of at least four distinct species. According to MycoBank, the European species Russula chloroides is synonymous with R.brevipes, although Index Fungorum and other sources consider them distinct species.|$|E

5|$|The Philippine–American War was {{an armed}} {{military}} {{conflict between the}} United States and the First Philippine Republic, fought between 1899 and least 1902, which arose from a Filipino political struggle against U.S. occupation of the Philippines.

5|$|Fischer-Elfert distinguishes ancient Egyptian {{graffiti}} {{writing as}} a literary genre. During the New Kingdom, scribes who traveled to ancient sites often left graffiti messages {{on the walls of}} sacred mortuary temples and pyramids, usually in commemoration of these structures. Modern scholars do not <b>consider</b> <b>these</b> scribes to have been mere tourists, but pilgrims visiting sacred sites where the extinct cult centers could be used for communicating with the gods. There is evidence from an educational ostracon found in the tomb of Senenmut (TT71) that formulaic graffiti writing was practiced in scribal schools. In one graffiti message, left at the mortuary temple of Thutmose III at Deir el-Bahri, a modified saying from The Maxims of Ptahhotep is incorporated into a prayer written on the temple wall. Scribes usually wrote their graffiti in separate clusters to distinguish their graffiti from others'. This led to competition among scribes, who would sometimes denigrate the quality of graffiti inscribed by others, even ancestors from the scribal profession.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the genus}} and the species within has a long and complicated history. Other genera of Oligocene indricotheres, such as Baluchitherium, Indricotherium, and Dzungariotherium, have been named, but no complete specimens exist, making comparison and classification difficult. Most modern scientists <b>consider</b> <b>these</b> genera to be junior synonyms of Paraceratherium, and that it contains at least four discernible species; P. bugtiense (the type species), P. transouralicum, P. prohorovi, and P. orgosensis, although the last may be a distinct genus. The most completely-known species is P. transouralicum, so most reconstructions of the genus are based on it. Differences between P. bugtiense and P. transouralicum {{may be due to}} sexual dimorphism, which would make them the same species.|$|E

5|$|Three sources {{report in}} some detail on the events {{before and during the}} battle, all of them drawing on {{first-hand}} Catalan accounts and reflecting the Catalan point of view: the near-contemporary chronicle of Ramon Muntaner, the Catalan version of the Chronicle of the Morea, and the account found {{in the history of the}} Byzantine writer Nikephoros Gregoras (ca. 1359). According to the Chronicle of the Morea, the Catalan army comprised 2,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry, at least 1,100 of whom were Turkish prisoners captured during their previous campaigns, and whose skill as archers they had come to value. Many of these Turks had even converted to Christianity. The sources differ on the size of Walter's army: Gregoras reports 6,400 cavalry and 8,000 infantry, the Aragonese version of the Chronicle of the Morea puts it at more than 2,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry, while Ramon Muntaner asserts that it comprised 700 knights and 24,000 infantry, mostly native Greeks. Modern scholars <b>consider</b> <b>these</b> numbers to be clearly exaggerated, but they do suggest that the Athenian army had numerical superiority over the Catalans.|$|E
5|$|Ancestors of Vedar {{migrated}} to Sri Lanka via the Indian sub continent during the pre-historic period. A number of Mesolithic sites have been excavated containing human remains dated to 35,000 BCE. Anthropologists <b>consider</b> <b>these</b> skeletal remains {{to belong to}} a group ancestral to some of the surviving Vedar groups. Sri Lanka has also yielded Megalithic burial sites, one of which was excavated close to a present Vedar settlement, Kathiraveli. The precise time in which some of the Vedar lineage founders {{migrated to}} the east coast of Sri Lanka is unknown. The earliest written reference to Vedar is a Tamil chronicle, Nadukadu paraveni kalvettu, which is maintained amongst the custodians of a prominent Hindu temple in the town of Tirukovil in the Ampara District. It is a Tamil 14th to 16th-century original text. The chronicle documents the presence of a people who practiced hunting and gathering for survival, exercising jurisdiction over vast jungle tracts close to the Akkaraipattu township. It names a number of Vedar chiefs, such as Kadariyan and Puliyan. These Vedars were not just hunter-gatherers, but were also accepted as the rightful owners of the forest lands.|$|E
