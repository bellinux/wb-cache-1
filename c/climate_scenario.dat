A variety of methodologies for scenario construction have been experimented with, {{all of them to}} a greater or lesser extent depending on the use of climate models. Yet the development of <b>climate</b> <b>scenarios</b> involves much more than climate modelling.

40|$|Here {{we present}} a set of {{regional}} <b>climate</b> <b>scenarios</b> of sea level rise for the northeast Atlantic Ocean. In this study, the latest observations and results obtained with state-of-the-art climate models are combined. In addition, regional effects due to ocean dynamics {{and changes in the}} Earth’s gravity field induced by melting of land-based ice masses have been taken into account. The <b>climate</b> <b>scenarios</b> are constructed for the target years 2050 and 2100, for both a moderate and a large rise in global mean atmospheric temperature (2 °C and 4 °C in 2100 respectively). The <b>climate</b> <b>scenarios</b> contain contributions from changes in ocean density (global thermal expansion and local steric changes related to changing ocean dynamics) and changes in ocean mass (melting of mountain glaciers and ice caps, changes in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and (minor) terrestrial water-storage contributions).

The resulting set of <b>climate</b> <b>scenarios</b> represents our best estimate of twenty-first century sea level rise in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, given the current understanding of the various contributions.

5000|$|Most {{research}} on ringed seals {{is focused on}} their requirement of sea-ice to live and reproduce. With proposed climate change increases to occur most dramatically at the poles, the Arctic is fated to change extremely mainly with the melting of ice and changes in snowfall. Ferguson et al. studied ringed seal recruitment in western Hudson Bay {{with a focus on}} six environmental variables, including: snow depth, snowfall, rainfall, the temperature when pups were born, North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) mechanisms, and lastly the spring break-up. The results of Ferguson et al. determined that decreases in snowfall had a negative effect on ringed seal recruitment, most likely from the occurrence of earlier break up of sea ice. The main process driving this break up is albedo, with less snowfall and more ocean exposed the ice melts more quickly. With seal pups being forced into the water sooner due to lack of ice, recruitment numbers drops and result in a downward trend of the population. [...] Ringed seals are not the only animals that require sea-ice in the Arctic and Sub-Arctic to thrive. Trophic levels come into play in terms of the food web and the reliance of one population on another or many others for survival. Most of this research is actually studied through simulations, since this requires future projections and interactions between many population, physical ocean, and biological mechanisms. Meier et al. studied current and future projections of climate in regards to sea-ice in the Baltic Sea by means of atmosphere-ocean models. Firstly, the ringed seal relies on sea-ice for breeding and is unable to breed on land, meaning, as ice melts away in the future, breeding grounds will become much scarcer. It was determined that only one bay, Bothnia Bay in the Baltic Sea, will be able to be used by ringed seals for breeding, vastly limiting their options. It was further determined that ringed seals are only able to be successful with strained conditions in areas of 90%-100% ice cover probability. (Meier et al. 2004) The changes in ice scarcity projected for the future seem to greatly hinder th ability for ringed seals to reproduce in the Baltic Sea. Interestingly, Hoover et al. looked at multiple marine populations in the Hudson Bay while factoring in both simulated current and higher harvest rates, ultimately determining that ringed seals are identified to increase in population. This is mostly due to the decrease in polar bear populations, the main predator to the ringed seal. Even with a doubling of harvest rates and under the high (A1B) <b>climate</b> <b>scenario,</b> the ringed seals were determined to thrive even more. Hoover et al. further determined that the ringed seal’s large presence as a circumpolar population along with unspecialized feeding makes the ringed seal less sensitive compared with other Arctic land and marine species. One of the final general conclusions made by Hoover et al. stated that while many current harvested populations will decrease with proposed climate change, ringed seals should be considered for redirecting harvest towards their populations.|$|E

The “Dry ” <b>climate</b> <b>scenarios</b> result in a considerable reduction in the simulated flows for both modeling applications, although the specific amount of reduction varies considerably between the two applications. The “Wet” <b>climate</b> <b>scenarios</b> cause relatively small amounts of change in simulated streamflow amounts.

The two watershed applications use different hydrologic simulation models, which is useful since the “true ” hydrologic response to variations in climate is unknown and using different models can present a range of credible simulated hydrologic responses.

30|$|An example {{illustrates}} how {{results from a}} drought vulnerability assessment following the method proposed by Spellmann et al. (2007, Spellmann et al. 2015) can valuably be amended by quantitative information on future species productivity. In a former study, we evaluated the necessity of adapting tree species selection in Uelzen and Fläming taking drought restrictions into account (Albert et al. 2017). For Uelzen we concluded {{that the number of}} Scots pine dominated stands will increase from 60 % refraining from drought limitations to 69 % under medium <b>climate</b> <b>scenario</b> and even 80 % under maximum <b>climate</b> <b>scenario</b> until 2070 (under minimum <b>climate</b> <b>scenario</b> the proportion is estimated to be constant). This strong preference of Scots pine in future tree species selection based simply on drought vulnerability limits is in line with the current analysis that no severe losses neither for periodic volume increment (Fig. 6) nor for MAImax (Fig. 7) are to be expected. For oak, however, a recommended slight increase from 7 % under the assumption of sufficient water supply to 8 % under maximum <b>climate</b> <b>scenario</b> might be challenged looking at the projected future productivity. If the productivity goal is rated high in the decision process, potential losses in periodic volume increment of up to – 2.5 m 3 ·ha– 1 ·yr– 1 might influence the decision process on species selection towards more productive species under climate change although oak qualifies as a species to be cultivated under the drought vulnerability limits. Evaluating European beech requires a different line of reasoning. In our species selection study we expected the proportion of beech dominated stands in Uelzen to drop from 16 % with no assumed drought limitations to 14 % under minimum, and an insignificant 2 % under median and maximum <b>climate</b> <b>scenario.</b> While these recommendations are based solely on the intrinsic and fuzzy approach transferring expert-knowledge of species’ productivity and risks into drought vulnerability classes we complement and confirm these results with sound information on projected substantial losses for beech looking at periodic volume increment and MAImax under climate change in Uelzen.|$|E
