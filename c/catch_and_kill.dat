In prison, Borden is visited by {{an agent of}} Lord Caldlow, who offers to care for Borden's {{daughter}} Jess in exchange for all of Borden's tricks. As a show of good faith, Caldlow gives Borden a copy of Angier's diary, which Borden reads.|$|E
25|$|The oncilla is a {{primarily}} terrestrial animal, {{but is also}} an adept climber. Like all cats, the oncilla is an obligate carnivore, requiring {{meat for}} survival. This cat eats small mammals, lizards, birds, eggs, invertebrates, and the occasional tree frog. Occasionally, the cat will eat grasses. The oncilla stalks its prey from a distance, and once in range, it pounces to <b>catch</b> <b>and</b> <b>kill</b> the prey.|$|E
25|$|Ferrets {{and dogs}} often kill adult kiwi. These predators can cause large and abrupt declines in populations. In particular, dogs find the {{distinctive}} strong scent of kiwi irresistible {{and easy to}} track, such that they can <b>catch</b> <b>and</b> <b>kill</b> kiwi in seconds. Motor vehicle strike {{is a threat to}} all kiwi where roads cross through their habitat. Badly set possum traps often kill or maim kiwi.|$|E

However, she continued using heroin and in 1985 her then-partner David Kelleher was arrested on charges of importing heroin worth more than $2 million. With Kelleher remanded into custody, Huckstepp began {{a relationship with a}} federal police officer, Constable Peter Parker Smith. Huckstepp visited Kelleher regularly in prison, telling him she was attempting to get information from Constable Smith which could be useful in his trial. In <b>Catch</b> <b>and</b> <b>Kill</b> Your Own, Neddy Smith claims that Huckstepp was trying to help Kelleher by making tape recordings of her conversations with Constable Smith.|$|E

The Fourth Avenue Beach at Asbury Park was {{enclosed}} with a steel-wire-mesh fence and patrolled by armed motorboats; it remained the only beach open following the Everingham incident. After the fatal attacks of Stilwell, Fisher, and Dunn, residents of Matawan lined Matawan Creek with nets and detonated dynamite {{in an attempt to}} <b>catch</b> <b>and</b> <b>kill</b> the shark. Matawan mayor Arris B. Henderson ordered the Matawan Journal to print wanted posters offering a $100 reward ($ in [...] dollars) to anyone killing a shark in the creek. Despite the town's efforts, no sharks were captured or killed in Matawan Creek.

Whilst certainly large enough to trap rodents, no rodents of any kind had, at that time, been observed within the pitchers of this species, as indicated in the type description and through subsequent clarification by the author, Alastair Robinson, who suggested that were rodents to be captured by the plant, it was likely to be through misadventure rather than by design, large bugs and flying insects appearing to be the usual prey.|$|R

2500|$|Prior to the inquest, Neddy Smith {{was interviewed}} four times by four {{separate}} teams of detectives. He {{claims that he}} was at home with his wife the night Huckstepp was murdered. However, he was secretly recorded confessing to a cellmate at Long Bay Correctional Centre. He was recorded saying he had attacked Huckstepp from behind, punched her, grabbed her by the throat, lifted her off the ground and then strangled her for about six minutes. Smith then claimed he dragged her into the pond and stood on her back to keep her head submerged for a few more minutes. He was also recorded saying that [...] "strangling somebody is the hardest thing in the world...(but) the most satisfying thing I ever did in my life". Smith later dismissed his confession as lies, saying he knew he was being taped and wanted the publicity for his new book, <b>Catch</b> <b>and</b> <b>Kill</b> Your Own. He is also alleged to have confessed to his publisher. Smith was subsequently charged in September 1996 with Huckstepp's murder and was committed to stand trial, but was acquitted in 1999. In an interview with writer John Dale, Smith claimed that Huckstepp was murdered because she kept [...] "bugging Roger, ringing him up and leaving messages that he was a dog...The reason they didn't bury her or dispose of the body was Roger wanted her left floating in the pond as a message. The bloke who killed her has never been arrested and is not in jail".|$|E

Now if the religion were really totemistic, the worshippers would be of the same blood as the animal they worshipped, and in eating an adorer of the crocodile, his enemies would be avenging the eating of their own sacred beast. When that beast was a crocodile, probably nothing but starvation or religious zeal could induce people to taste his unpalatable flesh.

6000|$|This is no trifling victory. Nay, a Kennet trout is far {{harder to}} <b>catch</b> <b>and</b> <b>kill</b> than the capricious salmon, which will often take a fly, however clumsy {{be the man}} who casts it. There is a profane theory that {{several members of the}} Hungerford Club never catch the trout they pay so much to have the {{privilege}} of trying to capture. A very sure eye and clever hand are needed to make the fly light dry and neat so close above the fish that he has not time to be alarmed by the gut. [...] "Gut-shy" [...] he is, and the less he sees of it the better. Moreover, a wonderful temper is required, for in the backward cast of the long line the hook will, ten to one, catch in a tree, or a flower, or a straw, or a bit of hay, and then it has to be disengaged by the angler crawling on hands and knees.

It is universally believed that they <b>catch</b> <b>and</b> <b>kill</b> kites, by exposing the rosy portion of their persons and concealing the rest; the bird pounces upon what appears to be raw meat, and presently finds himself viciously plucked alive. Throughout Arabia an old story is told of them. A merchant was once plundered during his absence by a troop of these apes; they tore open his bales, and, charmed with the scarlet hue of the Tarbushes, began applying those articles of dress to uses quite opposite to their normal purpose. The merchant was in despair, when his slave offered for a consideration to recover the goods. Placing himself in the front, like a fugleman to the ape-company, he went through a variety of man≈ìuvres with a Tarbush, and concluded with throwing it far away. The recruits carefully imitated him, and the drill concluded with his firing a shot; the plunderers decamped and the caps were recovered.|$|E
