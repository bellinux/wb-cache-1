5|$|Following his {{retirement}} on 30 November 1976 {{he continued to}} work, both at the Museum and at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, where his home at 17 High Park Road, Kew Gardens, Richmond (see image), gave him access to the herbarium and library, a short bicycle trip away. Indeed, 35% of his total publications appeared in the quarter century of {{his retirement}}. He was commissioned to write {{a history of the}} Museum for its centenary (1981), although he did so with some difficulty, due to deadlines and budget constraints. The task, which took three years, was made more difficult for him by the Museum's decision to censor his <b>critical</b> <b>comments.</b> He continued his association with the Lindley Library all his life, being an active committee member and regularly attended RHS flower shows even after he was barely able to walk.|$|E
5|$|From 14 December 1942 to 28 January 1943, Devers went on an {{inspection}} {{tour of the}} battlefields in North Africa, taking with him Brigadier Generals Edward H. Brooks and Williston B. Palmer from the Armored Force, and Gladeon M. Barnes from the Ordnance Department. He spoke with key British generals including Harold Alexander, Bernard Montgomery and Richard McCreery, and American commanders including Eisenhower, Patton, Thomas B. Larkin and Orlando Ward. Eisenhower was defensive, suspicious that Marshall may have sent Devers to replace him, and nervous when Devers had <b>critical</b> <b>comments</b> about {{the handling of the}} 1st Armored Division. Devers and his party received a great deal of feedback, both positive and negative about American equipment. Devers noted that the M4 Sherman was superior to the M3 Lee that the 1st Armored Division was equipped with, but urged the development of the more powerful 76mm gun.|$|E

5|$|He {{enjoyed a}} {{successful}} post-war career {{working for the}} U.S. government as a diplomat, civil servant, and administrator. His conversion to the Republican Party and his cooperation with his old friend, President Ulysses S. Grant, as well as <b>critical</b> <b>comments</b> {{he wrote in his}} memoirs about General Lee's wartime performance, made him anathema to many of his former Confederate colleagues. His reputation in the South further suffered when he led African-American militia against the anti-Reconstruction White League at the Battle of Liberty Place in 1874. Authors of the Lost Cause movement focused on Longstreet's actions at Gettysburg as a primary reason for the Confederacy's loss of the war. Since the late 20th century, his reputation has undergone a slow reassessment. Many Civil War historians now consider him among the war's most gifted tactical commanders.|$|E
5|$|Schmid left UCLA {{to replace}} Octavio Zambrano {{as head coach}} of the Los Angeles Galaxy five games into the 1999 MLS season. At the time, the team was ranked fifth in the Western Conference with a tally of only three goals. Under Schmid in the {{remainder}} of the season, the team had a record of 17–9, finished with the second-best record in the league and won their conference, earning him the MLS Coach of the Year Award. The team's captain, Robin Fraser, gave credit to Schmid's emphasis on defense after being named the MLS defender of the year. Los Angeles lost 2–0 to D.C. United in that year's MLS Cup. Schmid made <b>critical</b> <b>comments</b> of the referees after the match; he received a $1,000 fine and suspension for {{the first game of the}} following season.|$|E
5|$|Member of parliament, Inge Myrvoll, and {{president}} of the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association, Cpt.Peter Helland, both stated that the Accident Investigation Board should make a new inquiry about the accident. Cpt. Helland stated that the report's credibility was weakened due to the influence de Havilland Canada had during the process. On 10 June, the commission reopened the case, after having held meetings with Tyrer. The commission stated that there was disagreement as to if the tail rudder and tail plane or the end piece had cracked first, which would be crucial in determining the cause of the accident. Among the inquiries would be to re-investigate the tape of cockpit sound with new technology. The Accident Investigation Board used the National Aerospace Laboratory in the Netherlands to conduct tests on the end pieces. The report from the National Aerospace Laboratory was published on 23 March 1995, and supported the conclusion in the commissions report. The journalist Oddvar Kristoffersen in Fremover won the SKUP Award for 1994 for his work related to uncovering the controversy. The pilots' union in Widerøe was initially critical of the report, but by July it stated that it supported the conclusion. In addition, Det Norske Veritas withdrew its <b>critical</b> <b>comments</b> concerning the commission. With this, all officially involved parties supported the report.|$|E

25|$|While also {{available}} in Hong Kong and Taiwan, Hard Choices was effectively banned in mainland China as publishers there declined to purchase either the translation or English-language distribution rights for the book. Although Chinese publishers did not offer a specific reason for declining to buy the book, Simon & Schuster asserted that the ban was politically motivated as import agencies and publishers were fearful of retaliation by the Chinese government for printing material that was too politically sensitive, such as the chapter-length coverage of Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng and Clinton's generally <b>critical</b> <b>comments</b> about the Chinese government.|$|E

25|$|There {{was further}} {{controversy}} in July 2007 when Fincham {{was accused of}} misleading BBC One viewers. The incident involved a clip from forthcoming documentary A Year with the Queen which was shown to journalists during a press conference. It apparently showed the Queen storming out of a session with American photographer Annie Leibovitz over a disagreement about what she should wear, but the BBC subsequently admitted that the scenes used in the trailer had been edited out of their correct order, meaning that a false impression was given. Fincham admitted the error, but rejected calls that he should resign from his position as a result. His future was deemed uncertain following <b>critical</b> <b>comments</b> from Sir Michael Lyons, Chairman of the BBC Trust and he resigned on 5 October 2007.|$|E
25|$|In late 2008 {{and early}} 2009, Fantino was {{embroiled in a}} {{controversy}} surrounding his role in an internal discipline case at the OPP, in which Fantino was accused of being petty and vindictive in his actions against the officers. Fantino ordered a hearing into the matter but attempted to remove the adjudicator he had appointed {{on the grounds that}} the judge was biased against the commissioner due to <b>critical</b> <b>comments</b> he made during testimony by Fantino. Divisional Court rejected Fantino's request. The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the lower court decision saying an informed person viewing the matter realistically and practically would not conclude there was any apprehension of bias on the part of the adjudicator. The OPP dropped the disciplinary case against the two officers on December 15, 2009, the same day Fantino was due to be cross examined by defence lawyer Julian Falconer.

25|$|After {{his former}} {{national}} team manager Bruce Arena was named Galaxy {{head coach and}} Beckham joined Milan on loan in early 2009, Donovan once again was given the club captaincy on a permanent basis. In July 2009, Donovan received praise and criticism for his <b>critical</b> <b>comments</b> about Beckham in Sports Illustrated journalist Grant Wahl's book The Beckham Experiment, calling Beckham a poor captain and teammate. He later apologized to Beckham for discussing his concerns to a reporter rather than to him directly. The two reconciled upon Beckham's mid-season return to Los Angeles and Donovan enjoyed an outstanding 2009 campaign, winning the league's Most Valuable Player and MLS Goal of The Year 2009 award and leading the Galaxy to MLS Cup 2009, which they lost on penalties. Following the season, Donovan agreed to a four-year extension to his contract with the Galaxy, with clauses that allow him to seek loans during the MLS offseason. On August 1, 2010, Donovan scored the 100th goal of his MLS career. On September 18, 2010, he became the all-time leading scorer for the LA Galaxy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Critical</b> <b>comments</b> {{on these}} speculations {{appeared}} early on. But as psychiatric historian Jan Armbruster (University of Greifswald) judged, {{they were not}} sufficiently convincing, {{such as in the}} case of journalist Ottmar Katz, author of a biography of Hitler's personal physician, Theodor Morell (1982). Katz suggested that Karl Kroner might have had personal reasons to report some untruths: living as a Jewish refugee in Reykjavik and forced to earn his life as a blue-collar worker, Kroner possibly hoped that the U.S. authorities would not only acknowledge him as a key witness but also help him to reestablish his medical practice. A comprehensive plausibility test was finally performed by the Berlin psychiatrist and psychotherapist Peter Theiss-Abendroth in 2008. In 2009, Armbruster carried this analysis forward, dismantled the hypotheses of Hitler’s hysteria diagnosis and hypnotherapy completely, and showed in detail how the story of Hitler’s alleged treatment by Forster became progressively elaborate and detailed between 1943 and 2006, not due to the evaluation of historical documents, but to continuous addition of narrative embellishments. Furthermore, Armbruster’s work offers the to date most comprehensive critique of the methodological weaknesses of many Hitler pathographies.|$|E
