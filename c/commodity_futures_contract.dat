40|$|Commodity {{options are}} {{the right to buy}} or sell a {{specified}} quantity of a commodity, or <b>commodity</b> <b>futures</b> <b>contract,</b> at a specified price. The publicity surrounding several "boiler room" scams involving unwary buyers has given commodity options a bad name. Currently, only a handful of firms sell legitimate commodity options. Commodity options can, however, offer social benefits not provided by other investment vehicles. For example, they have several advantages over futures contracts. Their prices reflect information more quickly and fully than the prices of futures contracts. They allow investors to eliminate the risk of margin calls by paying an option "premium" up front. They allow producers and investors to hedge quantity, as well as price, risk for seasonal crops; using futures contracts, a farmer can form a perfect riskless hedge only if he knows exactly how much of a commodity he will have after a future harvest. Furthermore, the distribution of returns on options, which ensures that only the premium is lost regardless of how much futures prices fall, may attract to commodity option markets investors who need to hedge their assets against volatile fluctuations in price. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have recently moved to allow exchange trading of commodity options. Organized exchange trading may be expected to increase trading in, hence expand the social benefits of, commodity options. Exchange trading might also improve price "efficiency" in option markets. Tests using a variant of the Black-Scholes formula for option pricing indicate that, under the current system of private firm market-making, commodity option prices do not always accurately reflect all available information...|$|E

40|$|Measuring risk is {{mandatory}} in {{every form of}} responsible asset management; be it mitigating losses or maximizing performance, the level of risk dictates {{the magnitude of the}} effect of the strategy the asset manager has chosen to execute. Many common risk measures rely on simple statistics computed from historic data. In this thesis, we present a more dynamic risk measure explicitly aimed at the commodity futures market. The basis of our risk measure is built on a stochastic model of the commodity spot price, namely the Schwartz two-factor model. The model is essentially determined by a system of stochastic differential equations, where the spot price and the convenience yield of the commodity are modelled separately. The spot price is modelled as a Geometric Brownian Motion with a correction factor (the convenience yield) applied to the drift of the process, whereas the convenience yield is modelled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Within this framework, we show that the price of a <b>commodity</b> <b>futures</b> <b>contract</b> has a closed form solution. The pricing of futures contracts works as a coupling between the unobservable spot price and the observable futures contract price, rendering model fitting and filtering techniques applicable to our theoretic model. The parameter fitting of the system parameters of our model is done by utilizing the prediction error decomposition algorithm. The core of the algorithm is actually obtained from a by-product of a filtering algorithm called Kalman filter; the Kalman filter enables the extraction of the likelihood of a single parameter set. By subjecting the likelihood extraction process to numerical optimization, the optimal parameter set is acquired, given that the process converges. Once we have attained the optimal parameter sets for all of the commodity futures included in the portfolio, we are ready to perform the risk measurement procedure. The first phase of the process is to generate multiple future trajectories of the commodity spot prices and convenience yields. The trajectories are then subjected to the trading algorithm, generating a distribution of the returns for every commodity. Finally, the distributions are aggregated, resulting in a returns distribution on a portfolio level for a given target time frame. We show that the properties of this distribution can be used as an indicator for possible anomalies in the returns within the given time frame...|$|E
40|$|This study aims at {{investigating}} {{the benefits of}} integrating commodity futures contracts in devising commodity procurement policies {{as well as the}} design of supply contracts. To achieve this, a two-tier decentralised supply chain with uncoordinated risk transfer behaviours is studied. Specifically, the supply chain consists of a risk-neutral manufacturer (he) and a risk-averse retailer (she), where both players maximise their own objective functions by utilising the demand forecast update over the planning horizon. The mean-variance utility is employed to capture the retailer’s risk aversion behaviour. For the first objective, this study considers a commodity procurement problem for the risk-neutral manufacturer. It shows that partially procuring in the forward market is potentially beneficial because the logistics costs tend to be larger for tighter delivery schedule and vice versa. Existing literature has studied the value of forward procurement. This study further explores the value of the dynamic adjustment in the forward (futures) market in response to the demand information update. Specifically, when the joint distribution of demand and new information is a bivariate normal distribution, the optimal procurement policy is characterized analytically. The second objective is studied within the supply chain setting, where the manufacturer is assumed to be the Stackelberg leader. Recently, various financial hedging strategies have been developed to mitigate the price risks for firms which directly procure commodities for their operations. However, few, if any, studies have addressed the integration of financial hedging with supply contract design so that the risk exposure faced by the downstream player in the supply chain could be partially hedged. Although the downstream retailer does not procure any commodity directly, she may suffer from the commodity price volatility propagated from the upstream manufacturer. By formulating the problem as a dynamic program, a flexible contract with time-consistent closed-form financial hedging policy is derived. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the benefits gained by integrating the <b>commodity</b> <b>futures</b> <b>contract</b> with supply chain decision making. In the implementation, the short-term/long-term model developed by Schwartz and Smith is adopted to describe the stochastic behaviour of the price. Moreover, to preclude any risk-free arbitrage opportunity, the risk-neutral version of the model is employed. To take full advantage of the historical commodity price data, the smoother-based approach, rather than filter-based approach, is adopted to estimate the latent parameters of the stochastic price processes. For the manufacturer, it is shown that the value of the futures market is significant in the presence of logistics cost. Moreover, extra value could be obtained by adjusting the position in futures contracts in response to the newly observed information. For the decentralised supply chain, compared with the wholesale price contract, it is shown that the proposed flexible contract could improve the performance of the supply chain by leading to higher payoffs for both firms. Furthermore, the results show that flexible contract with financial hedging is effective on mitigating the commodity price risk exposure transferred from the manufacturer to the retailer when measured by standard deviation (SD), value-at-risk (VaR), and conditional VaR (CVaR). published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

The minimum-risk portfolio has a mean real rate of return of zero and a standard deviation of about 1 %. The slope of the tradeoff curve is initially 1, but it declines rapidly as one progresses up the curve to higher mean rates of return. 2) Stocks offer the highest mean and are also riskiest. 3) Bonds play a prominent part in portfolios which lie in the midsection of the tradeoff curve, although not much would be lost if these instruments were eliminated. 4) <b>Commodity</b> <b>futures</b> <b>contracts</b> are the only asset whose returns are positively correlated with inflation.
