A prototype was installed into the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> leading to the condenser. During the time of the German Wirtschaftswunder, the process which was marketed and further developed by Taprogge GmbH was widespread and very well received in the power stations due to its efficiency.

5000|$|In the 1970s, {{the product}} range was {{extended}} by backwash filters {{to protect the}} heat exchangers and condensers from macro fouling, like stones, pieces of wood, fibres, plastic sheeting, and mussels. Foreign matter will first settle on the filter surface. As fouling builds up, differential pressure between filter inlet and outlet increases and the filter has to be cleaned by backwashing. For this purpose an electrically driven rotor covers the filter surface which is connected with a pipe leading outside. Installed in this pipe is a valve that is opened during the backwash process. The accumulated fouling is drawn off and discharged via the pipe which, downstream of the condenser, leads to the main <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> or a debris container. This technology was spread in power stations and industrial plants the world over. Depending on the flow rates to be filtered, the filters are produced in nominal diameters from 150 mm to DN 3200 mm. The filter surface consists of stainless steel with punched holes. For difficult types of debris, filter surfaces of plastic or [...] can be used. A further type produced by the company are fine filters with filtration degrees from 50 to 1000 µm.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of ice growth {{that occurs in}} branched pipes (branch angle θ= 45 ° and 90 °) containing water flow was investigated experimentally. The experiments were carried out under various experimental conditions over the range of Reynolds number (based on pipe i. d.)

From the visualization of ice formation in the pipes, the branched pipe with flowing water was first blocked by ice formation : subsequently, the main pipe downstream of the branched portion was frozen off, and eventually the main pipe upstream of the branched portion was blocked by ice formation. As a result, freezing of the remaining water in the branched portion resulted in a pipe rupture at around the branched portion of the pipe. The transient behavior of ice formation, according to time proceeding, was expressed as {{a relationship between the}} pressure loss coefficient f and the Reynolds number Re for various cooling temperature ratios T. In addition, the critical condition of the complete ice blockage in branched pipes was obtained with experimental correlation equations in terms of T and Re. 水道管の凍結問題は、寒冷地域に住む住民の生活安定上解決しなければならない重要な課題である。従来より直円管内の凍結問題に関する研究は、理論的および実験的に数多くなされ、その凍結機構の全容は明らかにされつつある。著者らは、水道曲がり管の凍結現象解明の実験研究を種々の曲がり管を対象として行ってきた。その結果曲がり部の局所熱伝達率の大きい領域での凍結の進行が遅れ、曲がり部前後の直管部においてまず最初に凍結により管閉そくが起こり、最終的に曲がり部の停留水が密閉状態にて凍結し、曲がり部での管破壊が起こる機構とその凍結限界条件を解明した。水道管網においては、直管部、曲がり部以外に多数の配管分岐部より構成されているが、分岐管部の凍結に関する情報は、皆無に等しい。分岐管部は、曲がり部と同様に流れ状態の複雑な局所熱伝達率の大きい領域であり、凍結挙動も複雑となることが予想される。本研究は、水道管分岐部における基本的な凍結挙動に関する情報をえることを目的として、 45 °および 90 °分岐管を対象に、可視化実験による流れ作業、凍結層の進行状態の定性的把握および凍結層による分岐管前後の圧力差、温度差などの測定より、凍結による管閉そくの限界条件、管閉そくまでの時間そして主管と分岐管との相互干渉を実験的に検討したものである...|$|E
