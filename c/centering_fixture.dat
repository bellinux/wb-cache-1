5|$|Following the 2008 {{closing of}} Copia, {{a group of}} investors, developers, advocates, and vintners named the Coalition to Preserve Copia was formed to explore a plan to {{preserve}} the building and grounds. Part of the group's plan included forming a Mello-Roos district with participation of local hotel properties to finance bonds to purchase the property, but their effort failed. In May 2009 local developer George Altamura spoke about his interest in purchasing the property. Other developers including the Culinary Institute of America also {{expressed an interest in}} acquiring the property. Copia's bond holder, ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation, listed the property for sale in October 2009. Napa Valley College's upper valley campus became the home of the center's library of around 1,000 cookbooks. By late 2010, local chefs had revived the center's garden and the parking lot had become the location of a weekly farmer's market. In 2011, the museum was reported to still maintain its original furnishings, with the gift store fully stocked and the restaurant still furnished. In an April 2012 auction, most of the <b>center's</b> <b>fixtures,</b> furniture, equipment, wine collection (around 3,500 bottles), dinnerware, displays, artistic items, and antiquities were sold.|$|R

40|$|Chatter in micro and {{mesoscale}} milling adversely {{affects the}} surface quality of machined parts {{and increases the}} occurrence of tool breakage. Due to the relatively small sizes of micro and mesoscale tools with respect {{to that of the}} machine, this phenomenon is typically driven by the tool dynamics. In this paper, the effectiveness of a fixturing device, designed with the aim of mitigating chatter in micro and mesoscale milling, is assessed for various commercially available tools. The feasibility study discussed in this paper used a combination of numerical and analytical modeling, including finite element analysis and beam theory. By comparing the dynamic response of the machining <b>center</b> with <b>fixtures</b> of various designs, a technological window for the applicability of this approach was determined...|$|R

During this mission the P6 solar array had become damaged during the redeploy. Canadarm2 grabbed the arm on its <b>center</b> Flight-Releasable Grapple <b>Fixture</b> and then astronaut Scott E. Parazynski was mounted {{at the end of the}} boom to make the repair. Because Canadarm2 was unable to power the OBSS, it was without power many hours more than it was designed to handle, but because it was heated up considerably before the start of the repair it stayed undamaged.|$|R

The US Army rebuilt the hotel in 1952 and together with the neighbouring former studio of Minister Albert Speer (Evergreen Lodge) designated it an Armed Forces Recreation <b>Center.</b> Many original <b>fixtures,</b> furnishings and design pieces taken from the Platterhof, and other notable Nazi buildings in the area were used in the reconstruction and the hotel, now renamed after General Walker, was again restored to its status as one of Europe's grandest hotels.|$|R
40|$|A {{rotational}} {{setup for}} measuring interfacial fluid pressure and temperature was successfully constructed. Interfacial fluid measurements were performed with various slurries, slurry flow rates, and pad topographies. It was experimentally {{determined that the}} pad topography has the biggest effect in pressure and temperature distribution. This was also confirmed by tilt experiments ran in a rotational environment. For all cases, the edge high conditioned pad displayed the most changes during the experiments. For an edge high conditioned pad, the fluid pressure {{was found to be}} mostly subambient reaching levels of up to 42 kPa at the <b>center</b> of the <b>fixture,</b> and dissipating towards the edges. The pressure maps appear to be almost center symmetric. The pressure was found to be positive during the first second of contact, and rapidly turn subambient. The Subambient pressures stabilize after about 5 seconds, and their suction force was found to slow the rotating platen significantly. Suction forces were confirmed by displacement observed during the tilt experiments. The <b>fixtures</b> <b>center</b> was sucked down into the pad up to 20 m, and tends to tilt towards the leading edge. Interfacial temperatures were also found to vary with pad geometry. The edge-high conditioned pad exhibited changes of up to 4 C, concentrated at the center. The relative position and shape of these temperature rises matches the results observed in the pressure experiments. Temperature takes a longer time to reach equilibrium, up to 30 seconds in most measurements. M. S.

Thus {{the need for}} micron-scale repetition between opto-mechanical units is evident, especially in industrial manufacturing and medical breakthroughs. In this thesis, a novel optical metrology system is proposed, designed, and built whose purpose is to precisely locate {{the center of a}} mechanical fixture and then to assemble a plano-convex optical lens into the located position of the <b>fixture.</b> <b>Center</b> location specifications up to ± 3 µm decenter and ± 0. 001 ° tilting accuracy are required. Nine precisely positioned lenses and fixtures were built with eight units passing the requirements with a repetitive standard deviation of ± 0. 15 µm or less. The assembled units show satisfactory results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Precise {{movement}} during micromanipulation becomes {{difficult in}} submillimeter workspaces, {{largely due to}} the destabilizing influence of tremor. Robotic aid combined with filtering techniques that suppress tremor frequency bands increases performance; however, if knowledge of the operator’s goals is available, virtual fixtures have been shown to greatly improve micromanipulator precision. In this paper, we derive a control law for position-based virtual fixtures within the framework of an active handheld micromanipulator, where the fixtures are generated in real-time from microscope video. Additionally, we develop motion scaling behavior <b>centered</b> on virtual <b>fixtures</b> as a simple and direct extension to our formulation. We demonstrate that hard and soft (motionscaled) virtual fixtures outperform state-of-the-art tremor cancellation performance on a set of artificial but medically relevant tasks: holding, move-and-hold, curve tracing, and volume restriction.

40|$|A {{test fixture}} for {{measuring}} the dynamic performance of candidate high-temperature engine seal concepts has been installed at NASA Lewis Research <b>Center.</b> The test <b>fixture</b> {{has been designed to}} evaluate seal concepts under development for advanced hypersonic engines, such as those being considered for the National Aerospace Plane (NASP). The fixture can measure dynamic seal leakage performance from room temperature up to 840 C (1550 F) and air pressure differentials up to 690 kPa (100 psi). Performance of the seals can be measured while sealing against flat or distorted walls. In the fixture two seals are preloaded against the sides of a 30 cm (1 ft) long saber that slides transverse to the axis of the seals, simulating the scrubbing motion anticipated in these engines. This report covers the capabilities of this test fixture along with preliminary data showing the dependence of seal leakage performance on high temperature cycling...|$|R
40|$|A {{test fixture}} for {{measuring}} the performance of several high temperature engine seal concepts was installed at the NASA Lewis Research <b>Center.</b> The test <b>fixture</b> was developed to evaluate seal concepts under development for advanced hypersonic engines such as those being considered for the National Aerospace Plane. The fixture can measure static seal leakage performance from room temperature up to 1500 F and air pressure differentials up to 100 psi. Performance of the seals can be measured while sealing against flat or engine simulated distorted walls, where distortions can be as large as 0. 150 in. in only an 18 in. span. The fixture is designed to evaluate seals 3 feet long, a typical engine panel length. The seal channel can be configured to test square, circular, or rectangular seals that are nominally 0. 5 in. high. The sensitivity of leakage performance to lateral or axial loading can also be measured using specially designed high temperature lateral and axial bellows preload systems. Leakage data for a candidate ceramic wafer engine seal is provided by way of example to demonstrate the test fixture's capabilities...|$|R

40|$|Health {{monitoring}} of rotorcraft components, currently being performed by Health and Usage Monitoring Systems through analyses of vibration signatures of dynamic mechanical components, {{is very important}} for their safe and economic operation. HUMS analyze vibration signatures associated with faults and quantify them as condition indicators to predict component behavior. Vibration transfer paths are characterized by frequency response functions derived from the input/output relationship between applied force and dynamic response through a structure as a function of frequency. With an objective to investigate the differences in transfer paths, transfer path measurements were recorded under similar conditions in the left and right nose gearboxes of an AH- 64 helicopter and in an isolated left nose gearbox in a test fixture at NASA Glenn Research <b>Center.</b> The test <b>fixture</b> enabled the application of measured torques-common during an actual operation. An impact hammer as well as commercial and lab piezo shakers, were used in conjunction with two types of commercially available accelerometers to collect the vibration response under various test conditions. The frequency response functions measured under comparable conditions of both systems were found to be consistent. Measurements made on the fixture indicated certain real-world installation and maintenance issues, such as sensor alignments, accelerometer locations and installation torques, had minimal effect. However, gear vibration transfer path dynamics appeared to be somewhat dependent on the presence of oil, and the transfer path dynamics were notably different if the force input was on the internal ring gear rather than on the external gearbox case...|$|R
40|$|The {{benefits}} of horse therapy for special needs {{children have been}} documented for centuries, but direct experience and perspective from special needs {{children and their families}} involved in horse therapy are missing from the literature. The {{purpose of this study was}} to enhance understanding on the health, well-being, and ecological impacts of horse therapy for special needs children, and to demonstrate how horse therapy aligns with public health, by interviewing 8 special needs families who utilize the therapy, 8 adults who underwent horse therapy as children, and 12 ecological experts in local communities. Data were hand-coded and organized based on the phenomenology of the horse, the ethnography of horse and horse therapy culture and environment, and grounded theory to explain how and why horse therapy works. All 16 horse therapy participants with diverse challenges and limitations reported a successful experience with concrete changes in health and/or well-being as a result of horse therapy; all 12 ecological experts endorsed horse therapy <b>centers</b> as beneficial <b>fixtures</b> within the communities, despite obvious challenges, such as funding, in running them. Horse therapy can be used to help and support a wide-range of special needs families; horse therapy centers are beneficial assets to local communities and their public health programs. With respect to the social change implications of this study, the information can be used by community members (e. g., doctors, health professionals, occupational therapists, families) to better understand horse therapy and its benefits for special needs children. In an attempt to improve access and promote horse therapy as a viable public health initiative, a basic blueprint for horse therapy center start-up operations has been provided for local communities...|$|R
