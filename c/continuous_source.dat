2500|$|In 1992, {{a partial}} Camarasaurus grandis {{skeleton}} was discovered at the Bryan Small Stegosaurus Quarry of the Morrison Formation near Canon City, Colorado. This specimen preserved a partial right humerus catalogued as DMNH 2908 {{as well as}} associated vertebrae from the back and tail. In 2001, Lorie McWhinney, Kenneth Carpenter, and Bruce Rothschild published {{a description of a}} pathology observed on the humerus. They noted a juxtacortical lesion 25 by 18cm wide made of bone that resembled woven fibers. Although woven bone forms in accessory dental bone, in other locations it is a sign of injury or illness. The woven bone's [...] "undulating fibrous bundles" [...] were observed oriented {{in the direction of the}} M. brachialis. The lesion's [...] and lack of porosity at its near and far ends indicate the periostitis was inactive or healed. McWhinney and the other researchers argued that this injury would have been a <b>continuous</b> <b>source</b> of hardship for the animal. It would have exerted pressure on the muscles. This pressure would have compressed the muscles' blood vessels and nerves, reducing the range of motion of both the limb's flexor and extensor muscles. This effect would have hindered the M. brachialis, M. brachoradialis, and to a lesser degree the M. biceps brachii to the lesion's position on the humerus. The researchers inferred that the inflammation of the muscles and periosteum would have caused additional complications in the lower region of the forelimb as well. The lesion would also have caused long-term fasciitis and myosistis. The cumulative effect of these pathological processes would have moderate to severe effects on the ability of the limb to move and [...] "made everyday activities such as foraging for food and escaping predators harder to accomplish." ...|$|E
2500|$|Numerous early {{improvements}} {{were aimed}} at increasing reliability and life, including a switch from the [...] "U" [...] shaped top (exhaust) well to a [...] "V" [...] shaped top well. This eliminated the cast top deck, which had {{been the source of}} some early-life failures, in favor of a top deck fabricated from plate steel."Much field difficulty was experienced, particularly in the weld of the stress plate to the cast steel top deck. This difficulty can be blamed on two things. First, we were attempting to weld to cast steel which in some cases contained burned-in sand. This made welding inadequate due to slag inclusions, etc. Second, we were attempting to automatically weld against a back-up strip which in some cases did not fuse properly, leaving a bad notch effect which, of course, increased stress beyond working limits and fatigue failures resulted. There were approximately 600 of these crankcases made, twelve of which were 16s. Only four of these twelve were placed in railroad service. They were retired after about three years of service. A retirement program is now in effect for all of these cast top deck crankcases. A new crankcase was developed and went into production in early 1940 using a fabricated top deck, and can be most readily identified by a change in the exhaust well of the engine, which lies between the V's from U shape to a V shape. This design simplified top deck machining, eliminated the studding of the cast top deck by replacing the studs with through bolts retained by crabs {{at the bottom of the}} pots and crabs at the top of the cylinder heads, using self-aligning spherical washers and nuts (See Figure 49)." [...] The 567 gave way to the 567A in 1941, which incorporated further top deck improvements and camshaft gear train changes."By 1941 it was desirable to further simplify the crankcase, and the flat top deck Model 567 A crankcase was developed. This crankcase was first used on the 12 cylinder LST engines which started in production early in 1942. The crankcase incorporated a flat tie plate the full length of the engine which provided a flat surface for mounting exhaust manifolds and lift hooks (See Figure 50)."It was at this time that the gear train was simplified from four to two idler gears as explained previously. The cast steel cylinder head retainers were simplified over the second 567 design." [...] The 567B followed in 1946 with minor improvements."In 1946 a new line of crankcases, designated as the 567B, were introduced which were basically the same as the 567A except for a change to permit the mounting of the auxiliary generator drive gear. About three or four months after the introduction of the [...] "B" [...] engine the cylinder head retainer castings, which had been a <b>continuous</b> <b>source</b> of production problems, were replaced with steel forgings." [...] The 567C was released to further improve reliability and manufacturability. Visually, the 567C may be distinguished from earlier models by the presence of round (instead of square) handholes."We are in the final stages of developing a new crankcase to be known as the Model 567C which will further improve our product. One premise of this design has been to eliminate water on any stressed member of the crankcase because of corrosion difficulties. In the earlier crankcases just described, cracks have occurred in the area of the cooling water which were caused by corrosion fatigue (See Fig. 52). [...] "The entire fabrication has been simplified through the use of heavy rolled sections to make up the main stress members. Complex forgings are used in the top deck in place of the many steel stampings, thereby reducing a tremendous amount of fitting and manual welding." ...|$|E

60|$|Then, {{as to the}} way {{in which}} the heat is applied to the substance. It is all very well for me to take a piece of antimony, and fuse it in the flame of a blowpipe. But if I tried this piece in the {{ordinary}} lamp flame, I should do nothing; if I tried a smaller piece, I should do little or nothing; and if I tried a still smaller piece, I should do little or nothing; yet I have a condition which will represent what Deville carries to the highest possible extent, and which we all carry to the highest extent, in the use of the blowpipe. Suppose I take this piece of antimony: I shall not be able to melt it in that flame of the candle by merely holding it there; yet, by taking pains, we can even melt a piece of platinum there. This is a preparation which I made for the purpose of proving the fusibility of platinum in a common candle. There is a piece of wire, drawn by that ingenious process of Dr. Wollaston's, not more than the three-thousandth part of an inch in diameter. He put the wire into the middle of a cylinder of silver, and drew both together until the whole compound was exceedingly thin; and then he dissolved away the silver by nitric acid. There was left in the centre a substance which I can scarcely see with an eye-glass, but which I know is there, and which I can make visible, as you see, by putting it into the candle, where the heat makes it glow like a spark. I have again and again tried this experiment up-stairs in my own room, and have easily fused this platinum-wire by a common candle. You see we have, therefore, heat enough in the candle, as in the voltaic battery, or in the highly-exalted combustion of the blowpipe, but we do not supply a <b>continuous</b> <b>source</b> of heat. In the very act of this becoming ignited, the heat radiates so fast that you cannot accumulate enough to cause the fusion of the wire, except under the most careful arrangement. Thus I cannot melt that piece of antimony by simply putting it into the candle; but if I put it upon charcoal, and drive the fiery current against it, there will be heat enough to melt it. The beauty of the blowpipe is, that it sends hot air (making hot air by the combustion of the flame) against the thing to be heated. I have only to hold the antimony in the course of that current, and particle by particle of the current impinges upon the antimony, and so we get it melted. You now see it red-hot, and I have no doubt it will continue to burn if I withdraw it from the flame and continue to force the air on it. Now, you see it burning without any heat but that of its own combustion, which I am keeping up by sending the air against it. It would go out in a moment if I took away the current of air from it; but there it is burning, and the more air I give it, by this or any other action, the better it is. So, then, we have here not merely a mighty source of heat, but a means of driving the heat forcibly against substances.|$|E
