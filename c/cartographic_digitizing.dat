40|$|The {{digitizing}} of cartographic features is {{a necessary}} but laborious task to many research analysts undertaking cartographic or GIS studies. The requirements of a good digitizing module for the capture of such cartographic features are discussed in this paper. To meet these requirements, {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of using an existing <b>cartographic</b> <b>digitizing</b> module or a CAD package are discussed. As a CAD package cannot meet all of the requirements, the design of a CAD post-processing program for assembling polygons from chains and for automatically relating attributes to objects is presented...|$|E
40|$|A digital cartographic {{multisensor}} image database of excellent geometry and improved resolution {{was created by}} registering SIR-B images to a rectified Landsat TM reference image and applying intensity-hue-saturation enhancement techniques. When evaluated against geodetic control, RMSE(XY) values of approximately + or - 20 m were noted for the composite SIR-B/TM images. The completeness of cartographic features extracted from the composite images exceeded those obtained from separate SIR-B and TM image data sets by approximately 10 and 25 percent, respectively, indicating that the composite images may prove suitable for planimetric mapping at a scale of 1 : 100, 000 or smaller. At present, the most effective method for extracting <b>cartographic</b> information involves <b>digitizing</b> features directly from the image processing display screen...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to compare}} {{different}} methods to generate digital elevation models (DEM) of a catchment area, from <b>digitized</b> <b>cartographic</b> data. The selected study area was the Rocinha microbasin, located at south of Taubaté city, São Paulo state, Brazil. Eight different methods of interpolation were compared both by correlation analysis {{with the original}} data and by techniques of visual analysis. Correlation analysis allowed estimating the proportion {{of changes in the}} original elevation values caused by different interpolation methods, and the highest ratio found was 0. 09 % from the Kriging method. Despite the small proportions of changes in altitude values in cells intercepted by altimetric data, the cells that were not intercepted (located in the spaces between contour lines) showed considerable differences between the interpolation methods. The visual analysis of images generated using shaded relief, slope variation and bipolar differentiation technique allowed us to distinguish some artifacts produced by the different interpolation methods. We observed that the prevalence of artifacts occurs mainly in the plain areas, due to lower density of elevation data used in the interpolation process. We conclude that the selection of the interpolation method should consider the final application of DEM. Conventional methods of interpolation can disadvantage hydrological studies or applications that aim to calculate topographic variables from the DEM. Pages: 8880 - 888...|$|R
