50|$|<b>Coxalgia</b> sáljə {{also known}} as coxodynia (koks'ō-din'ē-ă) from coxa - hip (L) and -algia / odyne (G) pain and is defined as pain in the hip or disease-related pain of the hip. <b>Coxalgia</b> refers to general {{sensation}} of pain in the hip area, including the muscles surrounding the hip - Sartorius, tensor fasciae latae, ilio-tibila banding and the sensation of the tissue surrounding bones. <b>Coxalgia</b> will have an underlying cause- in adults this is most commonly osteoarthritis, degeneration of hip joints or bursitis (inflammation of the bursae -fluid sacs) of the joints. <b>Coxalgia</b> may precede diagnosis or identification of other diseases by some considerable time as indicated for monitoring and review.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Coxalgia</b> is {{a symptom}} of {{underlying}} hip joint pathology and must be examined and referred as the symptoms of pain and reduced mobility will increase and worsen, leading to chronic pain states. <b>Coxalgia</b> may be due to trauma, dysplasia and abnormal growth, degeneration, osteo-deficiencies of B12 or folate or metastasising cancer. Pain management should include robust use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Coxalgia</b> may {{be treated}} in the {{short-term}} by over-the-counter pain relief such as paracetamol, aspirin or ibuprofen. Further pain management must be sought in co-ordination with a GP or healthcare specialist.|$|E

5000|$|In 1855, the German {{physician}} Wilhelm Gollmann {{claimed that}} sodomy was initially committed by shepherds. He adds that shepherds {{were drawn to}} this method of pleasure for the [...] "want of more natural opportunities." [...] Gollmann then prejudicially attacks Sicilians, whom he claims commit zoophilia against goats. According to Blumenbach, the females of Guinea commit indecent acts against monkeys. Gollmann finalizes his dubious claims with his assertion that Iranians commit acts against donkeys as a cure for <b>coxalgia.</b>|$|E
40|$|Cellular angiofibroma {{is a rare}} mesenchymal tumor {{that usually}} affects the vulvar region. It is {{commonly}} asymptomatic and treated with radical excision. We describe the first case of cellular angiofibroma located in the retroperitoneum presenting with <b>coxalgia</b> and laparoscopically treated. At the 6 -month follow-up, the patient was <b>coxalgia</b> and disease free. <b>Coxalgia</b> is an unusual symptom for gynecologists; nevertheless, {{it is possible that}} several neoplasms may originate in the female pelvis, so any symptom requires careful evaluation. The laparoscopic approach may be effective in removing cellular angiofibroma, avoiding injuries to surrounding structures and unesthetic scarring and leading to a faster recovery...|$|E
40|$|Transient {{osteoporosis}} {{of the hip}} (TOH) is a rare disorder {{characterized by}} acute severe <b>coxalgia</b> and temporary osteopenia in the proximal femur. Although most cases were unilateral or staged bilateral TOH, some authors reported that the pregnant patients simultaneously had TOH in their bilateral hips. However, {{there has been no}} report of simultaneous bilateral TOH in the patient without pregnancy. A 25 -year-old Japanese woman without pregnancy had acute simultaneous bilateral hip pain. Plain X-ray of the bilateral hips did not show a periarticular osteopenia. However, magnetic resonance image obtained one week after the onset demonstrated increased T 2 -weighted signal intensity and decreased T 1 -weighted signal intensity in the bilateral femoral heads. She was treated conservatively, and follow-up magnetic resonance image at seven weeks after the onset returned to normal bone marrow signal intensity. Her bilateral <b>coxalgia</b> subsided gradually. At one year after the onset, she had no sign of symptomatic flair. Our experience with this case indicates that recognizing the possibility of simultaneous bilateral TOH is important unless the patient is pregnant, and magnetic resonance image is predictable test to make a diagnosis of TOH, {{even in the absence of}} abnormal finding on plain X-ray...|$|E
40|$|A 61 -year-old Japanese man {{underwent}} right {{total hip arthroplasty}} for hereditary multiple exostosis. At first presentation, he {{had suffered}} from <b>coxalgia</b> for a long time. On radiographic images, there was a gigantic femoral head, increased shaft angle, and large diameter of the femoral neck. He had also developed coxarthrosis and severe pain of the hip joint. The transformation of the proximal femur bone causes difficulty in setting a cementless total hip prosthesis. Therefore, total hip arthroplasty using a cemented polished tapered stem was performed via a direct lateral approach. Using a cemented polished tapered stem allowed us {{to deal with the}} femoral bone transformation and bone substance defectiveness due to exostosis and also minimized the invasiveness of the operation...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{case report}} on a young patient with severe {{osteoporosis}} that was initially revealed when she presented with polyarthralgia during her second pregnancy. Postpartum, the pain increased and her X-ray did not show any abnormalities. A bone scintigraphy was performed. It indicated an inflammatory rheumatic disorder. Six months after partum, an investigation of right <b>coxalgia</b> revealed a spontaneous basicervical fracture. Given the persistent polyarthralgia, the patient underwent a new scintigraphy, which revealed areas of {{what looked to be}} old rib and L 1 fractures. A subsequent full body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed signal abnormalities that could indicate multiple lower limb bone fractures. Despite exhaustive biological, radiological, and histological testing, no secondary cause for the osteoporosis was found. The patient was started on teriparatide. We finally concluded that, despite the atypical presentation, the patient was suffering from postpregnancy osteoporosis. It is possible that the frequency of occurrence of this still poorly understood disease is underestimated...|$|E
40|$|Bone {{involvement}} {{can represent}} the inaugural symptom of Gaucher's disease (GD). Here, we report {{the case of}} a 68 -year old man diagnosed as having GD since 1963. In June 1994 the patient was referred to our Rheumatology Unit because of a long-lasting <b>coxalgia</b> on the left hip and progressive walking impairment following traumatic fracture of the left femur. Multicystic osseous changes at standard X-ray and hyper-gamma-globulinemia with an elevated ESR (122 mm, 1 st hour) suggested the diagnosis of either osteonecrosis of the femoral head or multiple myeloma. On bone marrow biopsy examination, Gaucher's cell infiltrates were detected and an increased uptake in the distal left femur and proximal tibia were demonstrated by lipophilic tracer scan (99 mTc-Sestamibi). Subsequently, the patient suffered another femoral fracture at a site of Gaucher's infiltrates previously documented by bone scan. We conclude that in patients with GD, 99 mTc-Sestamibi bone scan can selectively evaluate the presence of bone lipid deposits, and could indirectly differentiate this bone condition from other serious skeletal complications of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Joint pain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{complaints}} with many possible causes. Some medicines used for joint pain relief such as NSAIDs have substantial and frequent side effects. Topical route possibly reduces adverse reactions by maximizing local delivery and minimizing systemic toxicity. Throughout history, plants have been the most important sources of medicines for human health and Iranian Traditional Medicine (ITM) is well known for its extensive use of herbal medicines to treat diseases accompanied with joint pain for centuries. In the present study, the plants used topically for relieving joint pain in ITM were searched. Moreover, their pharmacological effectiveness in modern medicine was reviewed. The terms “Waja mafasil” (joint pain), “Waja-ol-mafasil” (joint pain), “Irq-on-nasa” (sciatica), “Waja-ol-warik” (<b>coxalgia),</b> ‘Waja-ol-zahr” (back pain), “Waja-ol-rakbah” (knee pain) and “Niqris” (gout) were searched in three important Iranian traditional books including “Canon”, “Al-Hawi” and “Tohfat al-mu’minin” and topical preparations introduced as “Tela” and “Zemad” were selected. The scientific literatures were searched for their effectiveness related to the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities. Thirty five plants were selected on the basis of their topical use to relief joint pain. Among these plants, 22 species have been found to exhibit anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities...|$|E

40|$|We {{retrospectively}} reviewed 29 hips {{in which}} intertrochanteric osteotomies were performed for severe slipped capital femoral epiphyses. Mean age at surgery: 12. 6 years. Mean follow-up period: 6 years. At the final follow-up evaluation, one patient had <b>coxalgia,</b> and six hips showed a {{limited range of}} motion. A pistol-grip deformity was observed in 13 hips, osteoarthritis in two hips, and a bump existed in 19 hips on the latest radiographs. Gradual remodeling of the bumps was observed post-operatively in 22 hips. The mean α and β angles and offset α and β improved over time. The remodeling proceeded rapidly for 1 year post-surgery. We compared hips classified as β angles of ≥ 63 ° to < 63 ° at the final follow-up evaluation, the mean β angle 1 year post-surgery, and the mean ratio of improvement of the β angle per year from 1 year post-surgery to the final follow up, which differed significantly. Nearly all of the patients who underwent intertrochanteric osteotomies had residual morphologic abnormalities, but few had clinical symptoms. The β angle 1 year post-surgery and the ratio of remodeling of the bump from 1 year post-surgery to the final follow-up {{can be regarded as}} a potential predictor of morphologic results after intertrochanteric osteotomy...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The Enterobacter cloacae is a {{microorganism}} {{found in}} the intestinal flora {{of the majority of}} animals, including humans. Primary infections caused by E. cloacae are rare in immunocompetent patients, but are very common in hospital settings in newborns and immunocompromised patients, and can be aggravated by the insurgence of antibiotic resistance. The incidence of periprosthetic hip infections is just below 2 %. Case presentation: A 76  year old woman with multiple comorbidities underwent surgical implantation of intermediary total hip prosthesis of the left hip, in a different health facility, in February 2014, after the basicervical fracture of the upper femur extremity due to trauma. After an episode of dislocation of the prosthetic implant, in September 2014, she underwent a surgical operation to implant the acetabular component. A month later not in our facility, following a re-hospitalization for the dislocation of the arthroprosthesis, an infection from E. cloacae complex was discovered. After 2 years of chronic infection she came to our attention; the clinical picture featured <b>coxalgia</b> and secreting fistula in the surgical wound. Following a specific antibiotic therapy, carried out intravenously {{over the course of a}} month, we decided to intervene removing the left hip arthroprosthesis and placing an antibiotic spacer following the direction deduced from the antibiogram study of August 2016. Conclusion: The patient was hospitalized in our facility and 2 months later she underwent another operation to remove the antibiotic spacer and to place a new total hip arthroprosthesis. Multiple swabs showed the complete healing from the infection, which was confirmed a couple of months later...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{patients}} with chondrolysis secondary to slipped capital femoral epiphysis {{of the hip}} were followed up from a minimum of 7 {{to a maximum of}} 19 years (average, 13. 7 years) after the onset of the disease. The degree of slipping of the proximal epiphysis of the femur was severe in five patients and moderately severe in four patients. The nine patients were treated with non-weight bearing, antiinflammatory drugs, and physical therapy. The disease had a good resolution, with gradual regression of pain, and radiographs showed restoration of the joint space in an average of 10 months. At follow-up, mild <b>coxalgia</b> after prolonged activity was present in five patients, whereas in the one patient with concomitant avascular necrosis, pain was much more intense. All patients had some limitation of range of motion of the hip. It was most restricted in two patients, one with associated avascular necrosis and one with a severe slip. In all patients, radiographs showed restoration of the joint space. In the group with severe degrees of slipping, there were marginal osteophytes of the femoral head and the acetabulum. Significant arthrosis was present in the patient treated conservatively and in the patient with associated ischemic necrosis. In this long-term study of chondrolysis secondary to slipped capital femoral epiphysis, the overall prognosis was benign and was determined by the degree of slipping of the proximal epiphysis of the femur and concomitant aseptic necrosis. However, the authors believe that the {{patients with}} radiographic signs of degenerative joint disease may have a poor long-term prognosis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Syphilis is {{a chronic}} {{infection}} that is classified into three stages. In its tertiary stage, syphilis spreads to the brain, heart and other organs; the lesions may involve the skin, mucous membranes and bones. Neuropathic arthropathy associated with tertiary syphilis {{has rarely been}} described in Europe and its association with HIV-HCV co-infection has not been reported so far. This article reports {{the case of a}} man with tertiary syphilis presenting with rapidly evolving neuropathic arthropathy of the hip and extensive bone destruction. Case presentation On initial presentation, the patient complained of progressively worsening left-sided <b>coxalgia</b> without localized or generalized inflammation. The patient reported to have no history of previous infections, trauma or cancer. Plain x-ray films of the left coxofemoral joint showed marked degeneration with necrosis of the proximal epiphysis of femur and morphological alterations of the acetabulum without protrusion. Primary coxarthrosis was diagnosed and hip arthroplasty was offered, but the patient declined treatment. Three months later, the patient presented a marked deterioration of his general condition. He disclosed that he was seropositive for HCV and HIV, as confirmed by serology. Syphilis serology testing was also positive. A Girdlestone's procedure was performed and samples were collected for routine cultures for bacteria and acid fast bacilli, all resulting negative. Although histological findings were inconclusive, confirmed positive serology for syphilis associated with progressive arthropathy was strongly suggestive of tertiary syphilis, probably exacerbated by HIV-HCV co-infection. The patient partially recovered the ability to walk. Conclusions Due to the resurgence of syphilis, this disease should be considered as a possible cause of neuropathic arthropathy when other infectious causes have been ruled out, particularly in patients with HIV and/or HCV co-infection. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{clinical}} and roentgenologic assessment of subtrochanteric osteotomies (Froelich, Iino, and Schanz) for irreducible congenital dislocation {{of the hip}} {{was carried out in}} 25 joints of 19 cases which were followed out of 34 cases. They were the patients with highly congenital dislocation of the hips but without any previous treatment and operated at the Kojikaen (Hospital and Home for the Crippled Children in Kochi Prefecture) from 1956 to 1962, while the short term follow-up study was made by Dr. Y. Kato in 1964. The results were summarized as follows. 1) Postoperative evaluation of 19 cases according to Kato's method confirmed that there were no cases in excellent, 8 cases (42. 1 %) in good, 8 cases (42. 1 %) in fair, 2 cases (10. 5 %) in tolerable and one case (5. 3 %) in poor. Good and fair cases were clinically satisfactory but one poor case was re-operated by resection angulation osteotomy (Milch) due to severe <b>coxalgia.</b> 2) In the roentgenologic examinations, most of the cases showed that the osteotomized angles increased up to the corrected angles at the time immediately after the operation, although decrease of the angles was detected at the short term evaluation by Dr. Kato. The recovery of the osteotomized angles can be related to the satisfactory results in the clinical courses during the long term of about 15 years (mean). 3) There were no cases with disability in ADL because of deformities or instabilities in the knee joints regardless of different levels of the osteotomies. 5) It can be concluded that the subtrochanteric osteotomy is indicated for the patients with highly congenital dislocation of the hips especially at the ages from 10 to 20 years old. Resection angulation osteotomy (Milch) seemed to be most useful for the treatment of such old cases with severely congenital dislocation of the hips...|$|E
