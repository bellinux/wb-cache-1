Materials and Methods: This in-vitro study investigated the antibacterial and physical properties of Glass ionomer cement (GIC) with chlorhexidine and <b>cetrimide,</b> to determine the optimal concentration, for incorporation of these agents to obtain antibacterial GICs for use with the Atraumatic restorative treatment approach. This was assessed using the agar diffusion test. Chlorhexidine diacetate and <b>cetrimide</b> were added to Glass ionomer cement type-IX (GIC-FUJI IX) at 1 and 2 &#x 0025; W/W ratio. The experimental GIC specimens were placed on agar plates inoculated with Lactobacillus casei, and the area of inhibition was calculated after 48 hours. Results: All the experimental GICs exhibited inhibition of bacteria, but the sizes were dependent on the concentration of the antibacterial agent.

40|$|A {{selective}} medium containing 0. 1 % <b>cetrimide</b> in nutrient agar {{has been used}} here during {{the past four years}} for the routine identification of Ps. pyocyanea in burns (Lowbury, 1951). This medium, a modification of those previously de-scribed by Harper and Cawston (1945) and by Hood (1948), has proved convenient and efficient. In October, 1953, the manufacturers announced the production of a modified "cetavlon " which was claimed to be more active against Ps. pyo-cyanea than the old product, and little less active against that organism than against Proteus vul-garis. In view of these observations we have made the following tests to find whether the new cetri-mide is suitable for use in a {{selective medium}} for Ps. pyocyanea, and if so at what concentration it should be included. Choice of a Dilution of the New <b>Cetrimide</b> for the Selective Medium Media containing {{the old and the new}} <b>cetrimide</b> were compared by methods described by one of us in a previous paper (Lowbury, 1951).

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} the addition of <b>cetrimide</b> and polypropylene glycol to sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) on its capacity to dissolve pulp tissue. Bovine pulp fragments with standardized weight and volume were immersed for 5, 15 and 30 min in 2 mL of NaOCl and Hypoclean (NaOCl added with <b>cetrimide</b> and polypropylene glycol) solutions at 5. 25 %, 2. 5 %, 1 %, 0. 5 % and 0. 25 % and afterwards re-weighted. Distilled water was used as a control. The percentage of tissue loss was considered for statistical analysis (univariate ANOVA, SPSS, v. 17. 0) at 5 % significance level. There was no tissue dissolution in the control group. NaOCl added with surfactants (Hypoclean) dissolved more pulp tissue (p< 0. 05) than NaOCl alone. Tissue dissolution was directly dependent on the concentration of solutions (p< 0. 05), and also on the time range (p< 0. 05).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate and compare the influence of <b>cetrimide</b> on decalcifying capability of different irrigating solutions. Fifteen maxillary central incisor teeth has been collected. The canals were prepared in order to obtain four samples from each root. The specimens were randomly divided into 6 experimental groups (n= 10) according to tested irrigating agents. Irrigating agents consisted in different composition of EDTA and citric acid solutions, addicted or not with <b>cetrimide.</b> Each specimen was submitted to three successive 5 -min immersions in each solution. After exposures, the concentration of Ca 2 + extracted was measured by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Data were analysed by means of Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney tests. Significance was predetermined at p < 0. 05. For all irrigants, the amounts of Ca 2 + extracted from root canal dentin samples at 10 minutes were not significantly different from values reported after 15 minutes respectively. Therefore, for all irrigants tested, 10 minutes of application are sufficient to obtain maximum Ca 2 + release. Moreover citric acid based agents observed a higher release of Ca 2 +.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{thorough}} {{review of}} the literature revealed numerous selective media developed for culturing psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria of foods. Diamide (diazenedicarboxylic acid bisdimethylamide), <b>cetrimide</b> (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide), or cephaloridine were added to two nutrient media and eight media previously reported for selectively culturing pseudomonads and other psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria of foods. Four strains of bacteria associated with poultry spoilage and 9 strains suspected of interfering with the selectivity of the media were cultured. The addition of. 025 % diamide inhibited all the unwanted strains tested except Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It also inhibited P. fragi but permitted growth of P. fluorescens and P. putida. <b>Cetrimide</b> at 10 ppm allowed the growth of P. fragi but did not inhibit two Enterohacter strains.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the relative antimicrobial efficacy of five different commonly used antimicrobial agents {{with regard to}} {{reduction in the number}} of Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli as compared to normal saline. An agar disk diffusion in vitro method was used to test the efficacy of the root canal irrigants against these two microorganisms. The root canal irrigants used were: 5. 25 % sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 10 % citric acid, 17 % ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 3 % hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), 0. 2 % <b>cetrimide</b> and normal saline (as control). Materials and methods: The sample size consisted of 120 agar plates, divided into two groups: groups I and II. Group I consisted of 60 blood agar plates for assessment of E. faecalis and group II consisted of 60 MacConkey agar plates for assessment of E. coli. On each agar plate, 6 circular cellulose nitrate paper disks were placed, on which the inoculum of the respective microorganism was poured with a micropipette. After incubation, these paper disks were removed and put in test tubes containing the particular root canal irrigants, and were vortexed for 60 seconds. The microbial count was then assessed using a microbial colony counter. Results: Results showed that in the group I (E. faecalis), maximum reduction was achieved with <b>cetrimide,</b> followed by NaOCl, H 2 O 2, citric acid and then EDTA.
