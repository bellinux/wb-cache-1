5000|$|That's a much debated line... "I {{feel like}} she's {{slipping}} away." [...] Obviously, I planted it there and specifically then cut from his words {{to a close}} up of Peyton because I wanted to tell the audience, [...] "Well, he's talking about Peyton. Clearly, he's talking about Peyton." [...] As we know, that wasn't ultimately where his journey led him and it's been debated online and in certain circles that he never really said who it was.

McGrattan's experiences led to a desire to help others; he partnered with the NHL substance abuse program to act as a mentor for others who wanted the advice of a fellow player, and plans to spend his off-seasons earning a university degree in addiction counseling. McGrattan is also an advocate for anti-bullying charities and volunteers with Be The Game, a <b>camp</b> <b>that</b> supports underprivileged kids.|$|E
5|$|The panel issued {{over 500}} recommendations, {{including}} limiting {{the growth of}} the Banff townsite, capping the town's population at 10,000, placing quotas for popular hiking trails, and curtailing development in the park. Another recommendation was to fence off the townsite to reduce confrontations between people and elk. The proposed fencing was also intended to reduce access to this refuge for elk from predators, such as wolves that tended to avoid the townsite. Upon release of the report, Copps immediately moved to accept the proposal to cap the town population. She also ordered a small airstrip to be removed, along with a buffalo paddock, and cadet <b>camp,</b> <b>that</b> inhibited wildlife movement.|$|E

5|$|A Jack Russell named Bothy {{made history}} in 1982 {{as part of}} the Transglobe Expedition. Owned by explorers Ranulph and Ginny Fiennes, he became the first dog to travel to both the north and south poles. This feat is {{unlikely}} to be repeated, as all dogs have been banned from Antarctica by the Antarctic Treaty nations since 1994, due to fears that they could transmit diseases to the native seal population. Ranulph Fiennes and Charles Burton actually made the trip to the north pole by powered sledges before signalling to the base <b>camp</b> <b>that</b> they had arrived. To celebrate their achievement, a plane was sent out to take the two men champagne, along with Bothy.|$|E
