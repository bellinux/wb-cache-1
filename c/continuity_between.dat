The poem focuses on life, death, and <b>continuity</b> <b>between</b> the two. Humans are seen as disorderly and science is viewed as unable to save mankind from its flaws. Instead, science and reason lead mankind to warfare, and humanity needs to become humble in order to escape the cycle of destruction.

5|$|Following the {{declaration}} of the German republic in 1918 and the ensuing revolutionary period, the so-called Weimar Republic was founded in August 1919. To form a <b>continuity</b> <b>between</b> the anti-autocratic movement of the 19th century and the new democratic republic, the old black-red-gold tricolour was designated as the national German flag in the Weimar Constitution in 1919. Only the tiny German principalities of Reuss-Greiz, Reuss-Gera, and Waldeck-Pyrmont and its republican successor had upheld the tradition and had always continued to use the German colours of black, red, and or (gold) in their flag. As a civil ensign, the black-white-red tricolour was retained, albeit with the new tricolour in the top left corner.|$|E

Zenobia, left to secure the Palmyrene succession and retain the loyalty of its subjects, emphasized the <b>continuity</b> <b>between</b> her late husband and his successor (her son).

5|$|Julius Seelye Bixler {{reviewed}} the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review {{he wrote that}} he believed Stace was trying to have his {{cake and eat it}} with regards to the truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also wonders whether the revelation of God can really be free of concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is <b>continuity</b> <b>between</b> these two states and mystical language does appear to refer to concepts. Finally he rejects the book’s analogy of mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book is a fascinating confessio fidei and personal statement. A year later, he reviewed Time and Eternity alongside Religion and the Modern Mind. As well as reiterating the points he had made earlier, Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.|$|E
5|$|Loring Danforth, a {{professor}} of anthropology at Bates College, asserts that ethnic Macedonian nationalists, who are concerned with demonstrating the <b>continuity</b> <b>between</b> ancient and modern Macedonians, deny they are Slavs and claim to be the direct descendants of Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians. Danforth stresses, however, that the more moderate Macedonian position, publicly endorsed by Kiro Gligorov, the first president of the Republic of Macedonia, is modern Macedonians have no relation to Alexander the Great, but are a Slavic people whose ancestors arrived in Macedonia in the sixth century AD. Proponents of both the extreme and the moderate Macedonian positions stress that the ancient Macedonians were a distinct non-Greek people. In addition to affirming the existence of the Macedonian nation, Macedonians are concerned with affirming the existence of a unique Macedonian language as well. They thus emphasize that the Macedonian language has a history dating to the Old Church Slavonic used by Saints Cyril and Methodius in the ninth century.|$|E

40|$|The Houseless Shadow {{explores the}} <b>continuities</b> <b>between</b> London’s nocturnal {{life as it}} is now, {{compared}} with how it was observed 150 years ago. The essay Night Walks (1859) by Charles Dickens gives voice to the film; using the text to explore <b>continuities</b> <b>between</b> London’s nocturnal life as it is today, compared with how it was observed 150 years ago. Making the film was a process of retracing Dickens’s footsteps. Iconic landmarks evoke speculative thoughts about the penal system, liminal distinctions between sanity and madness and the hordes of London’s dead souls.

5|$|Others {{have argued}} that the {{cemetery}} represents a fusion of Christian and pagan Saxon customs. It was not {{until the end of the}} 7th century that the practice of burying people in consecrated ground around a church became the norm. There are examples of known Christians being buried in an ostensibly pagan fashion, as was the case for the late 7th century Kentish princess Eormengyth, sister of the abbess of Minster-in-Thanet. She was buried in a traditional tumulus a mile east of her sister's minster. John Blair argues that the Church in early Saxon England may have tolerated Christians being given pagan burial rites due to the 'Christianising' effect this would have had on a pagan site. This would have been consistent with the advice given by Pope Gregory the Great in 601 that Saxon shrines should be converted to Christian use, rather than being destroyed, and that pagan festivals and rites should be converted into Christian ones. On this interpretation, the cemetery may symbolise the <b>continuity</b> <b>between</b> the pagan past and the increasingly Christianised present.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Döblin's 18-year-old son Stefan {{was called}} up for {{military}} service in the French army. That spring had brought the good news that Klaus was alive and in Switzerland after a period working for the French resistance, and the grim tidings that Wolfgang was dead, having committed suicide five years earlier. In October 1945 Alfred and Erna arrived in New York, sailing aboard the Argentine back to Europe. They first settled in Baden-Baden, where Döblin worked for the French military government as official representative {{for the office of}} public education; he was tasked with approving manuscripts for publication, and vehemently opposed the approval of any texts by authors who had sympathized with National Socialism, such as Ernst Jünger or Gottfried Benn. In postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate, Döblin was unable to draw on his earlier success as an author, yet continued his literary engagement with a series of publications and journals that aimed to rebuild Germany's intellectual and cultural life, reintroducing the literature banned by the Nazis and fostering the growth of younger writers. Despite these efforts, Döblin was disappointed by the apparent <b>continuity</b> <b>between</b> the Nazi years and the postwar climate. His growing pessimism was fueled by his sense of isolation and marginalization within the postwar German literary scene. In 1953 Alfred and Erna returned to Paris despite the invitation by Brecht and Johannes R. Becher to settle in East Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Virgil C Aldrich {{reviewed}} the book alongside Religion and the Modern Mind and The Gate of Silence, also by Stace {{and published in}} 1952. He points out that all three books mark a new direction for Stace who was previously best known as an empiricist and naturalist. For Aldrich this new intellectual interest results in a sharp dualism in both Stace’s personality and his thought. However, he writes that fortunately Stace’s philosophical background prevents him from supposing that scientific empiricism can confirm religious experience, indeed his religious philosophy is the sort “that a Hume or a Kant can consort with.” Aldrich argues that Stace’s intellectual sophistication is most evident in his ideas about the negative divine, but his thought is liable to all the standard objections where he proposes notions of the positive divine and religious intuition. Specifically, the notion that religious language is evocative of the mystical experience is problematic, because {{it is difficult to}} determine what language is adequate without resorting to literal or abstract ideas. Rudolf Otto’s notion of analogy, rejected by Stace, is more robust. Aldrich points out a contradiction in Stace’s reliance on hierarchies of being and values to more adequately refer to God, as this implies <b>continuity</b> <b>between</b> the world and eternity, which Stace denies.|$|E

40|$|Male {{wild-type}} mice (Csa strain) {{were treated}} with ethyl-α-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate (CPIB), a hypolipidemic drug which enhances hepatic catalase synthesis and induces rapid and {{significant increase in the}} number of microbody (peroxisome) profiles in liver cells. Numerous microbody profiles, several of them appearing in clusters and retaining membranous continuities, were observed in liver cells of CPIB-treated mice. They showed a significant variation in size and configuration, and the presence or absence of the nucleoid or core did not appear to bear any relation to the size or shape of microbody profiles. Nucleoids were encountered frequently in microbody profiles measuring as small as 0. 1 μ in diameter. Numerous <b>continuities</b> <b>between</b> two or more anucleoid and/or nucleoid-containing microbody profiles of different sizes and shapes were seen. These findings are inconsistent with the concept that the smaller peroxisomes are the possible precursors or progenitors of their larger counterparts. Detailed examination of numerous electron micrographs revealed irregular dilatations and tortuosities of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) containing electron-opaque peroxisomal material displaying the characteristic appearance of matrix and usually containing irregular cores. Transitions of rough ER to smooth ER in which microbody proteins accumulated were also apparent. Numerous <b>continuities</b> <b>between</b> several microbody profiles and <b>continuities</b> <b>between</b> microbody profiles and ER are interpreted as accumulations of peroxisomal proteins in dilated tortuous channels of ER. These observations strongly suggest that the microbody proteins constitute a common pool, circulating constantly in the dilated ER channels. The size, shape and number of microbody profiles appear to reflect the amount of peroxisomal proteins present in the pool. These observations clearly suggest that the microbodies do not exist as individual entities...|$|R
