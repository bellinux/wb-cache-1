40|$|In a {{brief period}} of time after the 2001 - 2002 crisis, there was a {{dramatic}} fall in informal salaried employment in Argentina. Informal employment—also called “non-registered employment”—refers to employment for which no social security contribution is made. This indicator dropped by fifteen percentage points, from 49 % to 34 % from 2003 to 2012. This paper analyzes the recent evolution <b>of</b> informal <b>employment</b> and the main policies designed to reduce its scope and to encourage the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> quality <b>employment.</b> It has been observed that the decline in informal employment, measured as non-registered salaried employment, is primarily due to net <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> formal <b>employment</b> and, to a lesser extent, to net destruction <b>of</b> non-registered <b>employment.</b> The rate <b>of</b> informal <b>employment</b> declined in all sectors of the economy and in establishments of all sizes. Extensive mobility between non-registered salaried employment and inactivity (mainly among low-skilled women workers) has been observed as well and, albeit to a lesser extent, between non-registered salaried employment and formal employment. Since most informal workers are unskilled and perform their jobs in work units that are difficult for public policies to identify, a comprehensive policy approach is necessary, one that considers economic, social and employment issues. ...|$|R
