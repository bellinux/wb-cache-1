2500|$|The new-build {{grain ship}} MACs {{were based on}} the Ministry of War Transport's {{standard}} tramp hull which could just accommodate the Admiralty's revised requirement for a flight deck of not less than [...] length and [...] breadth: they were eventually built with flight decks of between [...] [...] The standard design used for the new-build tankers enabled a longer flight deck of approximately [...] with minor variations between individual ships. [...] An important enhancement was specified for the MACs' machinery. [...] A standard diesel tramp engine developed [...] to give a service speed of 11kn. but to provide some margin for flying operations, all the new-build MACs were fitted with engines rated at [...] which, in the grain ships, produced a speed of about 12kn. [...] The new-build tankers with their higher displacements were still capable of 11kn. while the pre-existing 'Triple Twelves' had a service speed of about 10.5kn. [...] The most obvious modification was the flight deck and its supporting structure which was arranged in sections (three on the grain ships; four in the case of tankers) with expansion joints between each. [...] The flight deck was built at the level that would normally have been occupied by the wheelhouse and in the 'Triple Twelves' this entailed removal of the existing wheelhouse and the funnel. [...] The space immediately under the flight deck was utilised for the arrester gear mechanisms, four wires to each MAC with an additional unit fitted to the tankers to operate the trickle wire and safety barrier. [...] A small island structure contained the bridge and wheelhouse and, in the tanker MACs, a chartroom that {{could be used as a}} pilots' briefing room. Less apparent modifications included; accommodation for 107 crew (about 50 more than normal); improved internal subdivision; additional ventilation, including exhaust arrangements that could be adjusted to vent to the leeward side; changes to lifeboat positions; and magazines for the safe stowage of bombs, depth charges, ammunition and pyrotechnics. [...] There were minor variations between the types. [...] In the grain MACs, [...] the armament sponsons or 'zarebas' could not project outboard of the moulded line of the hull which necessitated them encroaching onto the flight deck area so that the ship would not be prevented from using commercial berths, but this constraint did not apply to the tankers whose zarebas were extended outboard of the side. [...] One centre <b>cargo</b> <b>tank</b> in each tanker was adapted for the carriage of aircraft fuel (or 'Avgas') but in the grain ships this necessitated a special compartment containing two pressurised fuel tanks, together with a control room and associated piping.|$|E

50|$|An {{hydraulic}} tanker is an {{oil tanker}} designed to use water as an incompressible fluid for {{loading and unloading}} petroleum cargo. Each <b>cargo</b> <b>tank</b> is kept full at all times so oil floating on water will be pressed against {{the top of the}} tank. A <b>cargo</b> <b>tank</b> initially filled with water is loaded with the desired quantity of oil by pumping oil into the top of the tank displacing water which overflows through an opening {{at the bottom of the}} tank. The <b>cargo</b> <b>tank</b> is unloaded by removing oil from the top of the tank as water is admitted at the bottom.|$|E

5000|$|The boilers {{in these}} {{class of ships}} were unique in that they were dual-fueled. As on any other steam ship, the boilers {{operated}} on fuel oil; usually Bunker-C. Steam powered LNG carriers however, also burn natural gas. As the <b>cargo</b> <b>tanks</b> absorbed heat from the sea, {{a portion of the}} cryogenic LNG cargo boils off, changing from a liquid to a vapor (gas). As a result, pressure within the <b>cargo</b> <b>tanks</b> increases; similar to boiling water in a pressure cooker. To prevent rupturing the thin Invar tank material, pressure is controlled by venting the natural gas evaporate. Natural gas is either released to the atmosphere via vent stacks located above the <b>cargo</b> <b>tanks</b> or compressed and piped to the ship's boilers, which are designed to operate simultaneously on natural gas and fuel oil.|$|R

50|$|The seaborne {{transport}} of liquefied gases began in 1934 when {{a major international}} company put two combined oil/LPG tankers into operation.

This enabled transport over long distances of substantial volumes of an oil refinery by-product that had distinct advantages as a domestic and commercial fuel.

50|$|Chemical tankers {{normally}} {{have a series}} of separate cargo tanks which are either coated with specialized coatings such as phenolic epoxy or zinc paint, or made from stainless steel. The coating or <b>cargo</b> <b>tank</b> material determines what types of cargo a particular tank can carry: stainless steel tanks are required for aggressive acid cargoes such as sulfuric and phosphoric acid, while 'easier' cargoes — such as vegetable oil — can be carried in epoxy coated tanks. The coating or tank material also influences how quickly tanks can be cleaned. Typically, ships with stainless steel tanks can carry a wider range of cargoes and can clean more quickly between one cargo and another, which justifies the additional cost of their construction.|$|E
