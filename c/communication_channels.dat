5|$|Telecommunication is the {{transmission}} of signs, signals, messages, words, writings, images and sounds or information of any nature by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic systems. Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes the use of technology. It is transmitted either electrically over physical media, such as cables, or via electromagnetic radiation. Such transmission paths are often divided into <b>communication</b> <b>channels</b> which afford the advantages of multiplexing. Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange, the term, telecommunications, is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies.|$|E
5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening <b>communication</b> <b>channels,</b> so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E
40|$|Spoken {{dialogue}} systems {{typically do}} not manage the <b>communication</b> <b>channel,</b> instead using fixed values for such features as the amplitude and speaking rate. Yet, {{the quality of}} a dialogue can be compromised if the user has difficulty understanding the system. In this proof-of-concept research, we explore using reinforcement learning (RL) to create policies that manage the <b>communication</b> <b>channel</b> {{to meet the needs of}} diverse users. Towards this end, we first formalize a preliminary <b>communication</b> <b>channel</b> model, in which users provide explicit feedback regarding issues with the <b>communication</b> <b>channel,</b> and the system implicitly alters its amplitude to accommodate the user’s optimal volume. Second, we explore whether RL is an appropriate tool for creating <b>communication</b> <b>channel</b> management strategies, comparing two different hand-crafted policies to policies trained using both a dialogue-length and a novel annoyance cost. The learned policies performed better than hand-crafted policies, with those trained using the annoyance cost learning an equitable tradeoff between users with differing needs and also learning to balance finding a user’s optimal amplitude against dialoguelength. These results suggest that RL can be used to create effective <b>communication</b> <b>channel</b> management policies for diverse users.
