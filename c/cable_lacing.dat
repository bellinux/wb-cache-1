5000|$|Project {{design was}} by Yuncken Freeman and Griffiths and Simpson during 1956. The project {{architect}} was Barry Patten. Construction commenced in 1958 with an innovative system of <b>cables</b> <b>laced</b> together {{and covered with}} aluminium faced plywood sandwich panels. To ensure the structure would be watertight yet aerodynamically stable and flexible, new construction techniques were developed [...] Ground anchors were required to be corrosion resistant. The shell also needed to be acoustically correct. Construction entailed input {{from a number of}} engineering and scientific organisations including the Aeronautical Research Laboratories and CSIRO Forest Products Division.|$|R
50|$|Other {{methods of}} {{bundling}} cable together securely and semi-permanently include <b>cable</b> <b>lacing,</b> binding knots {{such as the}} surgeon's knot or constrictor knot, Velcro brand hook-and-loop strips, conveyor belt hooks, twist ties, Rapstrap fasteners, metal buckle clips or Cablox cable management.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>lacing</b> uses a thin cord, {{traditionally}} made of waxed linen, to bind {{together a}} group of cables using a series of running lockstitches. Flat lacing tapes made of modern materials such as nylon, polyester, Teflon, fiberglass, and Nomex are also available {{with a variety of}} coatings to improve knot holding.|$|E
50|$|A cable harness, {{also known}} as a wire harness, cable {{assembly}}, wiring assembly or wiring loom, is an assembly of electrical cables or wires which transmit signals or electrical power. The cables are bound together by straps, cable ties, <b>cable</b> <b>lacing,</b> sleeves, electrical tape, conduit, a weave of extruded string, or a combination thereof.|$|E
50|$|Other {{variations}} of basketweave change the stitch patterns that compose the rectangles. Instead of stockinette stitch and its reverse, the rectangles {{can be done}} in seed stitch, in <b>cables</b> or <b>lace.</b> An especially common variant is to alternate rectangles of ribbing with rectangles of welting, e.g., rectangles of three ribs set against rectangles of three welts.|$|R
40|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to imagine life without electricity, there are compiling confirmations show thatexposure to magnetic fields correlated electricity and radio frequencies pose magnificent hazards to human health. The most economist method to transfer electricity from power generation stations to users is by measures of high power transmission lines, buoyed by big transmission towers. The <b>cables</b> <b>laced</b> between the towers radiate magnetic and electric fields. In this research study, the magnetic field at ground level under 400 kV network lines extended in residential places have been conducted in two ways, mathematical calculation and practical measurement then the obtained results analyzed and compared with the international standards reference values. the reason of chose this type of transmission line is frequently using.

40|$|A {{berthing}} mechanism {{especially for}} use in berthing and compliant air-tight securing between manned space vehicle and modules is disclosed. The interface is provided {{by a pair of}} annular rings, one of which is typically, mechanically attached to the vehicle and the other to the module to which it is to be docked and secured. One of the two rings is attached to a base by resilient bellows. The facing surface of one annular ring is joined to a base by a <b>cable</b> <b>laced</b> through alternating pulleys attached circumferentially so that the interface surface of that ring may be tilted to accommodate angular misalignment as the annular rings are brought into docking (berthing) contact. Interleaving guide flanges with chambered sides provide at least some rotational mialignmnet correction. A plurality of electromechanical actuator/attenuator units provide means for extending one annular ring toward the other {{in the final stages of}} docking, for absorbing the initial docking shock and for drawing the annular rings into tight interface contact. Locking hooks provide for securing the interfaces...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>lacing</b> is {{a method}} for tying wiring {{harnesses}} and cable looms, traditionally used in telecommunication, naval, and aerospace applications. This old cable management technique, taught to generations of linemen, is still used in some modern applications since it does not create obstructions {{along the length of}} the cable, avoiding the handling problems of cables groomed by plastic or velcro cable ties.|$|E
5000|$|Color-coding of cables is {{sometimes}} {{used to keep}} track of which is which. For instance, the wires coming out of ATX power supplies are color-coded by voltage. Documenting and labeling cable runs, tying related cables together by cable ties, <b>cable</b> <b>lacing,</b> rubber bands or other means, running them through cable guides, and clipping or stapling them to walls are other common methods of keeping them organized. Above drop ceilings, hooks or trays are used to organize cables and protect them from electrical interference ...|$|E
5000|$|The lacing {{begins and}} ends with a {{whipping}} or other knot to secure the free ends. Wraps are spaced relative to the overall harness diameter to maintain the wiring in a tight, neat bundle, and the ends are then neatly trimmed. In addition to continuous or running lacing, {{there are a variety}} of lacing patterns used in different circumstances. In some cases stand-alone knots called spot ties are also used. [...] For lashing large cables and cable bundles to support structures in telecommunications applications, there are two named <b>cable</b> <b>lacing</b> styles: the [...] "Chicago stitch" [...] and [...] "Kansas City stitch".|$|E
40|$|The San Francisco Bay Area is {{blessed with}} one of the most {{extensive}} urban rail networks in the nation [...] the 80 -mile Bay Area Rapid Transit System, the 72 -mile CalTrain commuter rail system, a new light-rail service in Santa Clara County, and streetcars, trams, and <b>cable</b> cars <b>lacing</b> the streets of San Francisco. This extensive, multi-billion dollar network, however, has been unable to reverse mass transit’s continuing decline. A major reason why transit has been losing market share to the private automobile is that fixed guideway systems are ill-suited to a metropolitan area which continues to grow outward, in the form of low-density office parks, big-box retail outlets, and tract subdivisions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an iterative and adaptive perturbation technique {{for the analysis}} of nonuniform transmission lines. Place-dependent variations of the per-unit-length parameters are interpreted as perturbations with respect to their average values along the line. This allows casting the governing equations for the corresponding perturbations of the voltages and currents as those of a uniform transmission line with distributed sources. Therefore, standard transmission line theory is used to calculate these perturbation terms. Specifically, perturbations of increasing order are computed iteratively starting from the solution of the unperturbed line. The accuracy is adaptively adjusted by setting a threshold on the convergence of the solution. The algorithm turns out to be simple to implement and very accurate, yet faster than traditional approaches based on the discretization of the line into uniform sections. The technique is validated through the analysis of several nonuniform transmission line structures of relevance in EMC applications, namely uniformly and nonuniformly twisted wire pairs as well as a <b>cable</b> bundle with <b>lacing</b> cords...|$|R
40|$|For years {{intermediate}} filaments (IF), {{belonging to}} the third class of filamentous cytoskeletal proteins alongside microtubules and actin filaments, {{were thought to be}} exclusive to metazoan cells. Structurally these eukaryote IFs are very well defined, consisting of globular head and tail domains, which flank the central rod-domain. This central domain is dominated by an α-helical secondary structure predisposed to form the characteristic coiled-coil, parallel homo-dimer. These elementary dimers can further associate, both laterally and longitudinally, generating a variety of filament-networks built from filaments in the range of 10 nm in diameter. The general role of these filaments with their characteristic mechano-elastic properties both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus of eukaryote cells is to provide mechanical strength and a scaffold supporting diverse shapes and cellular functions. Since 2003, after the first bacterial IF-like protein, crescentin was identified, it has been evident that bacteria also employ filamentous networks, other than those built from bacterial tubulin or actin homologues, in order to support their cell shape, growth and, in some cases, division. Intriguingly, compared to their eukaryote counterparts, the group of bacterial IF-like proteins shows much wider structural diversity. The sizes of both the head and tail domains are markedly reduced and there is great variation in the length of the central rod-domain. Furthermore, bacterial rod-domains often lack the sub-domain organisation of eukaryote IFs that is the defining feature of the IF-family. However, the fascinating display of filamentous assemblies, including rope, striated <b>cables</b> and hexagonal <b>laces</b> together with the conditions required for their formation both in vitro and in vivo strongly resemble that of eukaryote IFs suggesting that these bacterial proteins are deservedly classified as part of the IF-family and that the current definition should be relaxed slightly to allow their inclusion. The lack of extensive head and tail domains may well make the bacterial proteins more amenable for structural characterisation, which will be essential for establishing the mechanism for their association into filaments. What is more, the well-developed tools for bacterial manipulations provide an excellent opportunity of studying the bacterial systems with the prospect of making significant progress in our understanding of the general underlying principles of intermediate filament assemblies...|$|R
