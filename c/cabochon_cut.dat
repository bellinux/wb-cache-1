500|$|Several Yogo sapphires {{are kept}} at the Smithsonian Institution. The {{earliest}} donations were {{noted in the}} museum's annual report on June 30, 1899, when the institution reported that Dr. L. T. Chamberlain gave them two cut Yogos and 21 other sapphires for their Dr. Isaac Lea gem and mineral collection. The record-setting [...] cut Yogo is also held by the Smithsonian. In 2006, gemologist Robert Kane of Fine Gems International in Helena, which has the world's largest selection of Montana sapphires, donated 333 Montana sapphires, weighing a total of , to the Smithsonian's Gem and Mineral Collection, along with 98.48grams of 18K yellow gold {{for the creation of}} a piece of jewelry. A representative of the Smithsonian asked Paula Crevoshay, a jewelry designer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to create a piece of finished jewelry from these gems. Crevoshay felt that a butterfly motif would best represent America's natural beauty, honor her mother's love of butterflies, and display the wide range of colors found in Montana sapphires. Crevoshay named the brooch [...] "Conchita" [...] in honor of her mother; it is also referred to as the [...] "Sapphire Butterfly Brooch", [...] "Conchita Sapphire Butterfly", and the [...] "Montana Butterfly Brooch". Two of the sapphires used are <b>cabochon</b> <b>cut</b> and the rest are brilliant cut. The majority are from the Rock Creek deposit. The largest one, however, is a blue Yogo used for the butterfly's head. Other sapphires used included yellow, purple, pink, and orange gems. Crevoshay completed the brooch in 2007; she and Kane presented the finished brooch to Smithsonian curator Jeffrey Post on May 7, 2007, in Washington, DC.|$|E

50|$|While some {{turquoise}} {{has been}} mined {{in the low}} hills east of Manassa, most of the jewelry industry in Manassa, and nearby, has utilized and polished the raw turquoise found in the copper and silver mines of Arizona and Nevada. Additionally, coral from the seas and other semiprecious <b>cabochons</b> and <b>cut</b> stones {{have been added to}} silver and gold jewelry.|$|R
40|$|Modern jewelry is prized for its {{pearls and}} precioustones-for the fine cutting {{of the stones}} and for their {{elaborate}} setting. This {{was not the case}} in antiquity, when diamonds and rubies were virtually unknown, and when emeralds and sapphires were extremely rare. The pearls and the precious and semiprecious stones that were sparingly used in Hellenistic and Roman jewelry were usually left rough, or if <b>cut,</b> <b>cut</b> <b>cabochon,</b> that is, in a smooth rounded form. Ancient jewelry was treasured for its gold, and, to a much lesser extent, its silver. Gold had been valued since remote antiquity on account of its rarity and incorruptibility. The survival of Greek and Roman gold coins and gold jewelry, as well as the reports of gold vessels and statues once deposited in ancientreasuries but now lost, reveal the value placed on this metal and the special uses to which it was put. Silver, on the other hand, though far more common than gold, corrodes. The vast numbers of ancient silver coins and vessels that we have today owe their survival to their relatively substantial form. Delicate jewelry of that metal cannot be expected to have survived in quantity, and, indeed, little has. The real reason, however, may be s. Gold pendant in the form of two that little was made.

50|$|Gems {{are usually}} given a <b>cabochon</b> <b>cut</b> to best display their chatoyance. Red stones are {{developed}} by gentle heat treatment. Dark stones are artificially lightened to improve color using a nitric acid treatment.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogrossular is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} gemstone, being <b>cabochon</b> <b>cut,</b> or made into beads. Sources for green and pink hydrogrossular are South Africa, Canada, and the United States. White hydrogrossular is sourced from Burma and China.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of asteriated stones such as star sapphires and chatoyant stones such as cat's eye chrysoberyl, a domed <b>cabochon</b> <b>cut</b> is used to show the star or eye, which would not be visible in a faceted cut.|$|E
50|$|Large {{stones were}} {{frequently}} set in box-bezels on enamelled rings. Most of the gemstones are <b>cabochon</b> <b>cut,</b> {{but there are}} a few with more modern faceted cuts, including rose cut and star cut. A particularly large Colombian emerald, originally the size of an apple, had been hollowed out to accommodate a Swiss watch movement dated to around 1600, signed by G. Ferlite.|$|E
5000|$|Nephrite is {{a variety}} of the calcium, magnesium, and iron-rich {{amphibole}} minerals tremolite or actinolite (aggregates of which also make up one form of asbestos). The chemical formula for nephrite is Ca2(Mg, Fe)5Si8O22(OH)2. [...] It {{is one of two}} different mineral species called jade. The other mineral species known as jade is jadeite, which is {{a variety of}} pyroxene. While nephrite jade possesses mainly grays and greens (and occasionally yellows, browns or whites), jadeite jade, which is rarer, can also contain blacks, reds, pinks and violets. Nephrite jade is an ornamental stone used in carvings, beads, or <b>cabochon</b> <b>cut</b> gemstones.|$|E
5000|$|An {{asterism}} is {{an optical}} phenomenon displayed by some rubies, sapphires, and other gems (i.e. star garnet, star diopside, star spinel, etc.) of an enhanced reflective {{area in the}} shape of a [...] "star" [...] on the surface of a <b>cabochon</b> <b>cut</b> from the stone. Star sapphires and rubies get their asterism from the titanium dioxide impurities (rutile) present in them. The Star-effect or [...] "asterism" [...] is caused by the dense inclusions of tiny fibers of rutile (also known as [...] "silk"). The stars are caused by the light reflecting from needle-like inclusions of rutile aligned perpendicular to the rays of the star. However, since rutile is always present in star gemstones, they are almost never completely transparent.|$|E
