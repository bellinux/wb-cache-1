2500|$|Pathologically, DLB is {{characterized}} by the development of abnormal collections of (alpha-synuclein) protein within the cytoplasm of neurons (known as Lewy bodies). These intracellular collections of protein have similar structural features to [...] "classical" [...] Lewy bodies, seen subcortically in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, those affected by DLB experience a loss of dopamine-producing neurons (in the substantia nigra) {{in a manner similar to}} that seen in Parkinson's disease. A loss of acetylcholine-producing neurons (in the basal nucleus of Meynert and elsewhere) similar to that seen in Alzheimer's disease also is known to occur in those with DLB. Cerebral atrophy also occurs as the cerebral cortex degenerates. [...] Autopsy series have revealed the pathology of DLB is often concomitant with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. That is, when Lewy body inclusions are found in the cortex, they often co-occur with Alzheimer's disease pathology found primarily in the hippocampus, including senile plaques (deposited beta-amyloid protein), and granulovacuolar degeneration (grainy deposits within and a <b>clear</b> <b>zone</b> around hippocampal neurons). Neurofibrillary tangles (abnormally phosphorylated tau protein) are less common in DLB, although they are known to occur, and astrocyte abnormalities are also known to occur. Presently, whether DLB is an Alzheimer's variant or a separate disease entity is not clear. Unlike Alzheimer's disease, the brain may appear grossly normal with no visible signs of atrophy.|$|E

Along both shores the smoke {{thickened}} also, lying below the roofs in a level streak as you may see a long cloud cutting the slope of a mountain. A tumult of war-cries, the vibrating clang of gongs, the deep snoring of drums, yells of rage, crashes of volley-firing, made an awful din, in which Brown sat confounded but steady at the tiller, working himself into a fury of hate and rage against those people who dared to defend themselves. Two of his men had been wounded, and he saw his retreat cut off below the town by some boats that had put off from Tunku Allang's stockade. There were six of them, full of men. While he was thus beset he perceived {{the entrance of the}} narrow creek (the same which Jim had jumped at low water). It was then brim full. Steering the long-boat in, they landed, and, {{to make a long story}} short, they established themselves on a little knoll about 900 yards from the stockade, which, in fact, they commanded from that position. The slopes of the knoll were bare, but there were a few trees on the summit. They went to work cutting these down for a breastwork, and were fairly intrenched before dark; meantime the Rajah's boats remained in the river with curious neutrality. When the sun set the glue of many brushwood blazes lighted on the river-front, and between the double line of houses on the land side threw into black relief the roofs, the groups of slender palms, the heavy clumps of fruit trees. Brown ordered the grass round his position to be fired; a low ring of thin flames under the slow ascending smoke wriggled rapidly down the slopes of the knoll; here and there a dry bush caught with a tall, vicious roar. The conflagration made a <b>clear</b> <b>zone</b> of fire for the rifles of the small party, and expired smouldering on the edge of the forests and along the muddy bank of the creek. A strip of jungle luxuriating in a damp hollow between the knoll and the Rajah's stockade stopped it on that side with a great crackling and detonations of bursting bamboo stems. The sky was sombre, velvety, and swarming with stars. The blackened ground smoked quietly with low creeping wisps, till a little breeze came on and blew everything away. Brown expected an attack to be delivered as soon as the tide had flowed enough again to enable the war-boats which had cut off his retreat to enter the creek. At any rate he was sure there would be an attempt to carry off his long-boat, which lay below the hill, a dark high lump on the feeble sheen of a wet mud-flat. But no move of any sort was made by the boats in the river. Over the stockade and the Rajah's buildings Brown saw their lights on the water. They seemed to be anchored across the stream. Other lights afloat were moving in the reach, crossing and recrossing from side to side. There were also lights twinkling motionless upon the long walls of houses up the reach, as far as the bend, and more still beyond, others isolated inland. The loom of the big fires disclosed buildings, roofs, black piles as far as he could see. It was an immense place. The fourteen desperate invaders lying flat behind the felled trees raised their chins to look over at the stir of that town that seemed to extend up-river for miles and swarm with thousands of angry men. They did not speak to each other. Now and then they would hear a loud yell, or a single shot rang out, fired very far somewhere. But round their position everything was still, dark, silent. They seemed to be forgotten, as if the excitement keeping awake all the population had nothing to do with them, as if they had been dead already.' ...|$|E

40|$|To {{carry out}} a genetic {{analysis}} of the degradation and utilization of chitin by Serratia marcescens 2170, various Tn 5 insertion mutants with characteristic defects in chitinase production were isolated and partially characterized. Prior to {{the isolation of the}} mutants, proteins secreted into culture medium in the presence of chitin were analyzed. Four chitinases, A, B, C 1, and C 2, among other proteins, were detected in the culture supernatant of S. marcescens 2170. All four chitinases and a 21 -kDa protein (CBP 21) lacking chitinase activity showed chitin binding activity. Cloning and sequencing analysis of the genes encoding chitinases A and B of strain 2170 revealed extensive similarities to those of other strains of S. marcescens described previously. Tn 5 insertion mutagenesis of strain 2170 was carried out, and mutants which formed altered <b>clearing</b> <b>zones</b> of colloidal chitin were selected.

Wasta sample which have mixture of B. licheniformis, B. firmus and Bosea thioxidants showed the largest <b>clearing</b> <b>zones</b> diameter in heavy oil.

Methods: Between January 2013 and April 2014, 19 patients (8 men and 11 women) underwent posterior lumbar interbody fusion or posterior lumbar fusion using the CBT technique. A total of 109 screws were used for evaluation with measurement of the maximum insertional torque of last two screw rotations. Clear zone-positivity on plain radiographs was investigated 6 months after surgery. The relation between intraoperative insertional torque and clear zone-positivity was investigated by one-way analysis of variance. In addi-tion, the correlation between clear zone-positivity and gender, age ( 75 years old), or operative stabilization level ( 3 vertebral levels) was evaluated using the chi-square test.
