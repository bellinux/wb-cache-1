5000|$|In March 2010 the London Assembly {{authorised}} {{a review}} {{into the future}} of London TravelWatch, undertaken by the Business and Management Committee. The Committee was empowered to examine the effectiveness of London TravelWatch as an advocate body for transport users. As part of this process, user groups across London alongside elected representatives made submissions to the Committee. In September 2010 the Committee published its findings, chiefly to recommend London TravelWatch be abolished. This was the only option put forward by the GLA {{for the future of}} transport user representation in London. (Other options that could have been considered, but were not, were to either merge London TravelWatch completely with Transport Passenger Focus (now Transport Focus), or to leave TravelWatch as a stand-alone body, but with reduced functions.) The Committee argued there was too much duplication between London TravelWatch and the national watchdog Passenger Focus that the cost of London TravelWatch was too great, and that transport users interests would be better represented by elected politicians rather than a board composed of residents of the London TravelWatch area appointed after open competition on the basis of merit. It was proposed that rail matters in London, including complaints, be handled by Passenger Focus. For other transport modes the <b>complaints</b> (<b>appeals)</b> function was to be transferred to a complaints unit which would be part of the London Assembly. The remaining functions of the Board (which would cease to exist) would be carried out by the elected members of the Transport Committee.|$|E

40|$|This issues paper {{sets out}} the {{systemic}} issues {{we see in}} education providers’ monitoring and reporting of overseas students for unsatisfactory course progress and attendance. Introduction The National Code of Practice for Registration Authorities and Providers of Education and Training for Overseas Students 2007 (National Code) requires education providers to be proactive in warning and assisting students {{who are at risk}} of failing to meet course progress and/or attendance requirements. If a student subsequently fails to achieve satisfactory course progress and/or attendance, the provider must notify the student in writing that it intends to report them. The written notice must inform the student that they are able to access the registered provider’s <b>complaints</b> and <b>appeal</b> process. If the student is not satisfied with the result or the process of the internal <b>complaint</b> handling and <b>appeals</b> process, the provider must advise the student in writing of his or her right to access the external appeal process. The Overseas Students Ombudsman is a statutorily independent <b>complaints</b> and <b>appeals</b> body for overseas students with private registered providers. The third and fourth most  common type of <b>complaints</b> or <b>appeals</b> we receive are unsatisfactory course progress and attendance appeals. After examining 169 course progress and 279 attendance external appeals, both good and poor practices have been noted. An understanding of what constitutes best practice for course progress and attendance monitoring has been developed. In many cases poor practices have resulted in us recommending that the provider not report  the student as the proper process had not been followed. In other cases, providers have followed all the required processes and we found the provider was required to report the student as their course progress and/or attendance was unsatisfactory...|$|R
