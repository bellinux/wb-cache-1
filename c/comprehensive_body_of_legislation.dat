40|$|From 1820, {{increased}} settler {{movement into}} Van Diemen’s Land prompted {{the need for}} improved communications; but small population numbers and high commercial risk factors discouraged the establishment of inland passenger transport enterprises. After 1830, population growth near the two main towns, and the colonial Post Office’s evolving inland communications route structure, encouraged transport infrastructure and stage-coach enterprise development, as physical and financial security became more assured. The financially constrained colonial government, transitioning from penal, through self-governing colony to federation, was reluctant to operate businesses where private enterprise might provide the means. Instead, where possible, it subsidised construction, contracted for services, devolved responsibility to local communities, and enacted a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation</b> to achieve these ends. Government and stage-coach enterprises alike faced commercial uncertainty caused by economic depressions, {{the high cost of}} capital, a reduction in wages, and from outflows of free citizens. Adjustment was necessary following the introduction of steam-powered ferries, the electric telegraph and the railways; population growth was slow and only the opening of new mines increased the potential passenger transport market. The skills required by managers within a convict/free settler society {{in the face of such}} economic, financial, legal, social, and workforce uncertainty and complexity were considerable. Yet settlers with capital were primarily interested in land acquisition, and not in service industries. Therefore, stage-coach entrepreneurs were drawn from a free-settler, lower socio-economic group, or from convict expirees with limited business skills, and insolvency was a constant risk. Monopoly of both the route and the logistic support chain was a perceived means towards viability, but was unpopular with government and the press. The large numbers of confident and energetic, yet ordinary, men and women within the stage-coach enterprises, served their communities, and made a considerable contribution to the island’s social development, inclusion and capital, and to its economy; yet they are historiographically unnoticed...|$|E

40|$|To {{accommodate}} the growing ethical concern regarding the way farm animals are treated, a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation</b> {{has been developed}} to ensure the welfare of animals from birth to slaughter. Alongside governmental measures, the last decades have witnessed a proliferation of voluntary animal welfare standards developed by supermarkets and non-governmental organisations. Thus, within the European context, significant advancement has been reached {{in the implementation of}} good animal practices. But how to address ethical consideration in countries that export meat to Europe? Ethical demands for foreigner food production are most likely to revolve into an international trade conflict as it is regarded as an extra jurisdictional measure. By looking at the relation between European and Brazilian actors in the field of animal welfare policies, this article seeks to capture the transnational governance of animal welfare. Drawn upon the literature of policy transfer and stakeholders’ interview in Brazil and Europe, this study identified three main channels through which European animal welfare policies and practices reach farms in Brazil. Accordingly with the set of actors, instruments and procedural differences underlying the functioning of each channel, we have named them as: governmental, commercial and civil. We observed that in the context of EU-Brazil relation, ethical claims for animal welfare prospered mostly through commercial and civil channels. The outperformance of governmental channels by nongovernmental channels indicates a shift from ‘hard transfer’ to ‘soft transfer’ in cross-border animal welfare dialogue. The finding that measures developed by governmental actors are surpassed by private measures poses questions {{from the perspective of the}} international trade regulation. Will the current welfare governance evolve into a shift from ‘hard trade barrier’ to ‘soft trade barriers’? And if so, how does it relate to the multilateral trade system since private standards and animal welfare are both controversial topics for Members of the World Trade Organisation...|$|E
40|$|When a {{dependency}} severs {{its formal}} {{connection with the}} mother country - irrespective of the century in which such severance occurs - the act of independence can neither eradicate the past nor solve all problems of the future. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the United States of America discovered that independence from Great Britain in itself did not abolish the need for rules and regulations by which men could anticipate {{with some degree of}} certainty the consequences of particular actions. Wholesale adoption of such English statutes as were suited to their condition offered a solution to the need for a body of laws. At the same time it avoided the need to draft and enact a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation</b> at the moment the newly independent jurisdictional entities were faced with a wide assortment of internal and external problems. As colonists, the citizens of these newly independent states had clamored for the untrammelled use of the English statutes and the common law and had made much of Great Britain 2 ̆ 7 s refusal to concede such use. After 1776 they were free to use, adapt, or reject the statutes and the common law which they had claimed as their birthright and heritage. This study is designed to show the extent to which British statutes without re-enactment were declared to be or were considered to be in force or not in force in the twenty-eight separate jurisdictions of the United States during the first sixty years of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s independence. To keep the scope of the study within reasonable limits, no substantial effort was made to learn the extent to which English statutes were re-enacted as state or territorial statutes. That this re-enactment did occur in some jurisdictions is apparent upon an examination of the early state or territorial statutes, especially those dealing with subjects such as wills or uses or waste. That such re-enactment, together with the enactment of state or territorial acts geared to local needs, lessened the use of and emphasis upon English statutes is likewise apparent. It is not irrelevant to note that codification of a jurisdiction 2 ̆ 7 s laws was more frequently than not coupled with a repeal of all English statutes heretofore in force. [URL]...|$|E
