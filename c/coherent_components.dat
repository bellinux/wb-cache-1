40|$|We {{consider}} novel {{implementation of}} quantum teleportation protocol of unknown qubit by superposition of displacement operators with equal modulo but opposite in sign amplitudes. Entangled hybrid state with <b>coherent</b> <b>components</b> of small amplitude {{is used as}} quantum channel. <b>Coherent</b> <b>components</b> of the quantum channel displace the teleported qubit at the same absolute but opposite in sign values, so that any information about amount by which the qubit is displaced is lost {{despite the fact that}} one of these events has definitely occurred. Alice unambiguously distinguishes her measurement outcomes and Bob obtains at his disposal two states of a single photon in superposition state of two modes. The superposition of the displacement operators is nonunitary, so success probability of the protocol depends on the amplitude parameters of the teleported qubit. Remarkably, the success probability of the teleportation can be made arbitrary high for some amplitude values of the teleported state by means of initial amplitude modulation of unknown qubit and bits of classical information for Bob to identify the states. The scheme is realized by linear optics methods and works without photon number resolving measurement. Comment: Research highlights 1. Novel implementation of quantum teleportation of unknown qubit is proposed. 2. The implementation is based on use of superposition of the displacement operators with equal modulo but opposite in sign amplitudes. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv: 1605. 0673...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{performance}} of a free-space optical (FSO) link affected by atmospheric turbulence and line-of-sight (LOS) blockage. For this purpose, the atmospheric turbulence induced fading is modeled by the M-distribution, which includes the Gamma-Gamma distribution as special case. We exploit the fact that the physical interpretation of the M-distribution allows to split the optical energy through the propagation link into three different components: two <b>coherent</b> <b>components</b> and one incoherent scatter component. Based on this separation, we derive novel analytical expressions for the probability density function (PDF), for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and for the moment generating function (MGF) of the M-distribution under the temporary blockage of the <b>coherent</b> <b>components,</b> hereinafter referred to as LOS blockage. Further, a new closed-form expression for the outage probability (OP) under LOS blockage is derived in terms of the turbulence model parameters and the LOS blockage probability. By means of an asymptotic analysis, this expression is simplified in the high-SNR regime and the OP in terms of the diversity order and diversity gain is then deduced. Obtained results show that the impact of the LOS blockage on the OP strongly depends on the intensity of the turbulence and on the LOS blockage probability.
