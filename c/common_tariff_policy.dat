Food security concerns, the growing focus on expanding national food production, and aspirations to develop value-added food processing industries pose important policy challenges in terms of balancing the interests of consumers, agricultural producers and food processors. Despite {{the existence of a}} number of regional integration initiatives (two customs unions, two free trade areas, and a grand free trade area under negotiation), several obstacles to intra-regional trade of food {{and agricultural}} products exist, in the form of exceptions to the principle of the free movement of goods and to the <b>common</b> external <b>tariff,</b> divergent <b>policies</b> on food safety requirements, sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, and divergent product standards.

40|$|AbstractThe {{rapid growth}} of China's economy has {{accelerated}} its energy demand, which is becoming more urgent. It is essential to exploit renewable energy because of the limited conventional energy, high energy consumption and serious pollution.

However, China's rapid growth in renewable energy, particularly wind, has been accompanied with some growing pains, and {{there is room for}} improving the legal framework to address these challenges. A reasonable renewable energy <b>tariff</b> <b>policy</b> has a pivotal role for changing China's current situation.

The exercises reveal that during the II Reign tariffs were important in explaining variations in total imports, although this importance diminished after 1869.

In addition to results regarding the build-up and draw down rates {{as a function of the}} amount of disruption or probability of future disruption our central conclusion is that build-up and drawdown policies are essentially the same with or without international cooperation, due to the current inventory limits on U.

40|$|We {{examine whether}} free trade is {{superior}} to <b>tariff</b> <b>policy</b> if the government of an importing country cannot precommit to an ex ante optimal tariff rate {{in the presence of}} a time lag between production and trade decisions. Based on a simple partial equilibrium model with an export monopoly, we show that the preferable choice between free trade and a time-consistent <b>tariff</b> <b>policy</b> depends on the market size of the importing country. More specifically, if the market size is larger than a certain level, the importing country prefers free trade to the time-consistent <b>tariff</b> <b>policy.</b> However, because a free trade policy is not credible {{in the presence of a}} time lag, the government of the importing country requires international organizations and rules such as GATT/WTO as commitment devices. Thus, using a game theoretic approach, we analyze under what conditions becoming a member of the international organizations is a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium and show that a free trade policy under the GATT/WTO regime is Pareto improving for the importing and exporting countries. free trade, time-consistent tariff, time lag, market size, GATT/WTO...|$|R
