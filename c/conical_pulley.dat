50|$|Efforts {{to improve}} the {{accuracy}} of watches prior to 1657 focused on evening out the steep torque curve of the mainspring. Two devices to do this {{had appeared in the}} first clock-watches: the stackfreed and the fusee. The stackfreed, a spring-loaded cam on the mainspring shaft, added a lot of friction and was abandoned after about a century. The fusee was a much more lasting idea. A curving <b>conical</b> <b>pulley</b> with a chain wrapped around it attached to the mainspring barrel, it changed the leverage as the spring unwound, equalizing the drive force. Fusees became standard in all watches, and were used until the early 19th century. The foliot was also gradually replaced with the balance wheel, which had a higher moment of inertia for its size, allowing better timekeeping.|$|E

They use a continuously variable transmission employing a belt and a <b>conical</b> <b>pulley</b> system. Thus, they require no clutch or gear shifts to operate. Many third-party attachments are available for the Gator, including snow plows, sanders, and gun racks. The recommended maximum payload capacity is 600 lbs (272 kg). The size of the AMT was designed to easily be loaded {{into the back of a}} pickup truck (of the day) to be transported to various remote and/or hard to get to location that conventional means such as towing a trailer would prove dangerous or troublesome. The overall design of the first and second All-Material Transporters (AMTs) were simple, easy to maintain, and easy to fix on site.|$|E
50|$|Many keywind watch {{movements}} {{make use}} of a fusee, to improve isochronism. The fusee is a specially cut <b>conical</b> <b>pulley</b> attached by a fine chain to the mainspring barrel. When the spring is fully wound (and its torque the highest), {{the full length of}} the chain is wrapped around the fusee and the force of the mainspring is exerted on the smallest diameter portion of the fusee cone. As the spring unwinds and its torque decreases, the chain winds back onto the mainspring barrel and pulls on an increasingly larger diameter portion of the fusee. This provides a more uniform amount of torque on the watch train, and thus results in more consistent balance amplitude and better isochronism. A fusee is a practical necessity in watches using a verge escapement, and can also provide considerable benefit with a lever escapement and other high precision types of escapements (Hamiltons WWII era Model 21 chronometer used a fusee in combination with a detent escapement).|$|E

In the current configuration, the cones have been moved apart so the belt [...] "falls" [...] into the space between them. By moving the cones closer, the belt is forced to ride higher {{on the sides of}} the cones, changing the pulley ratio.|$|R
40|$|Crude oil {{is a major}} natural {{resource}} and the mainstay of any country that have it in abundance; its sole disadvantage is its tendency of spilling to the environment. Kenaf {{has been found to}} be a good absorbent for physical clean-up and treatment of oil spillage both on land and water surfaces. Kenaf absorbs the oil thus making it soaked and the absorbed oil can however be recovered using appropriate technology. The aim of the research work is to design and construct an oil extractor to remove and recover the absorbed oil from kenaf bast and core. The functional parts of the machine are: barrel (80 mm diameter and 1000 mm length), worm shaft (minimum diameter 50 mm and maximum diameter 65 mm), gear reduction box (20 : 1), prime mover (7 hp, 1420 rpm), oil and cake outlet, hopper, <b>conical</b> restrictor, <b>pulley</b> and transmission belts. The worm shaft was tapered to build up pressure as it travels across the length of the barrel and it conveys, grinds, presses and squeezes oil out of kenaf into the oil outlet via the oil collection tray. The residual cake from where the oil was extracted is extruded out of the cake outlet in form of briquettes. The oil extractor machine was evaluated in compliance with Philippines Agricultural Engineering Standard PAES 230 and 231 : 2005 and the results showed a percent kenaf recovery of 60 %, extraction efficiency of 62. 2 %, throughput capacity of 36. 5 kg/hr and an extraction loss of 37. 8 %. The extraction efficiency varies with the moisture content of the soaked kenaf bast and core. The operation of the machine does not require any technical-know-how and the machine can be easily maintained as it has the tendency of self-lubricating the extraction chamber due to presence of oil in the input materials...|$|R
50|$|Some drill presses {{and milling}} {{machines}} contain a pulley-based CVT where the output shaft has {{a pair of}} manually adjustable <b>conical</b> <b>pulley</b> halves through which a wide drive belt from the motor loops. The pulley on the motor, however, is usually fixed in diameter, or may {{have a series of}} given-diameter steps to allow a selection of speed ranges. A handwheel on the drill press, marked with a scale corresponding to the desired machine speed, is mounted to a reduction gearing system for the operator to precisely control the width of the gap between the pulley halves. This gap width thus adjusts the gearing ratio between the motor's fixed pulley and the output shaft's variable pulley, changing speed of the chuck. A tensioner pulley is implemented in the belt transmission to take up or release the slack in the belt as the speed is altered. In most cases, the speed must be changed with the motor running.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Flat {{conveyor}} belts supported and driven by cylindrical drums {{run in a}} state of instability because of lack of guiding forces. Faults such as asymmetry in the position or shape of pulleys and idlers, uneven load distribution or acting transverse forces such as those induced by friction will make the belt run out of true. On the other hand, some of these effects are used for guiding flat running belts. This paper deals with the guiding effects of two significant features; the skewed cylindrical pulley and the <b>conical</b> <b>pulley.</b> In the first part the implemented measurements are described and in the second part a mechanical model is established for both features. Finally, in the third part measurements are compared with simulation results to verify the developed mechanical model...|$|E
