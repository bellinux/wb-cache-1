The low income bias of the benefit calculation means that lower paid worker receives a much higher percentage of his or her salary in benefit payments than higher paid workers.

To minimize the impact of Social Security taxes on low salaried workers the Earned Income Tax Credit" [...] and the Child Care Tax Credit were passed, which largely refund the FICA and or SECA payments of low-salaried workers through the income tax system. By Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculations the lowest income quintile (0-20%) and second quintile (21-40%) of households in the U.S. pay an average federal income tax of -9.3% and -2.6% of income and Social Security taxes of 8.3% and 7.9% of income respectively. By CBO calculations the household incomes in the first quintile and second quintile have an average total federal tax rate of 1.0% and 3.8% respectively. However, these groups also have by far the smallest percentage of American household incomes – the first quintile earns just 3.2% of all income, while the second quintile earns only 8.4% of all income. Higher-income retirees will have to pay income taxes on 85% of their Social Security benefits and 100% on all other retirement benefits they may have.|$|E

Heyns, Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley from 1965 to 1971, is the smaller of the two and exhibits hand-carved wood ceilings depicting the names of famous academics throughout history, {{as well as the}} companion piece to Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware, Washington Rallying the Troops at Monmouth. The piece was originally a gift to the university in 1882 by Mrs. Mark Hopkins but was soon forgotten after it was stored in the Hearst Women's Gymnasium.

30|$|Traffic {{congestion}} has a hefty toll on {{the society}} and economy. In one estimate, the cost of congestion in 2010 in the urban areas of the USA amounted to USD 101  billion [1, 2]. A recent study shows that the avoidable cost of congestion for the Australian capital cities {{is estimated to be}} around AUD 16.5  billion for the 2015 financial year, which is a significant increase from about AUD 12.8  billion for 2010 [3]. It seems there is no <b>ceiling</b> <b>cap</b> for such costs. For instance, traffic congestion could cost the UK economy more than £ 300  billion over the next 16  years which represents a 63 % increase in annual costs by 2030 [4]. Building more roads should not be the put forward as the first solution to the congestion for the following reasons: (1) More roads encourages more trips; something is known as induced demand [5]. (2) More roads may adversely cause more congestion; the phenomenon is known as Braess’ paradox [6, 7]. (3) Roads’ constructions are capital intensive and time-consuming [8, 9].|$|E

500|$|Crewed by a seven-man team, {{the first}} {{aircraft}} performed a short {{take off from}} Svyatoshino Airfield, Kiev. This was the first flight of an aircraft that was powered only by propfans. Due to worsening weather conditions over Antonov's headquarters and the flight test area in Kiev, the flight was cut short, and the flight <b>ceiling</b> was <b>capped</b> at 2,000 m (6,500ft). The crew took the aircraft to a height of 450 m (1,475ft), while performing basic checkouts of the prototype's systems. After having been airborne for less than half an hour, the aircraft landed at Antonov's flight test facility at Gostomel. During the flight, engineers identified problems with the engine gearboxes, and so the aircraft was grounded for eight weeks while the issues were fixed.|$|R

50|$|Brick Gothic in Poland is {{sometimes}} described {{as belonging to}} the Polish Gothic style. Though, {{the vast majority of}} Gothic buildings within the borders of modern Poland are brick-built, the term also encompasses non-brick Gothic structures, such as the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków, which is mostly stone-built. The principle characteristic of the Polish Gothic style is its limited use of stone work to complement the main brick construction. Stone was primarily utilized for window and door frames, arched columns, ribbed vaults, foundations and ornamentation, while brick remained the core building material used to erect walls and <b>cap</b> <b>ceilings.</b> This limited use of stone, as a supplementary building material, was most prevalent in Lesser Poland and was made possible by an abundance of limestone in the region—further north in the regions of Greater Poland, Mazovia and Pomerania the use of stone was virtually nonexistent.|$|R
40|$|Total EU- 15 {{agricultural}} {{expenditures for}} 2004 (market support, direct aid, and rural development) {{are set to}} rise to € 45, 797 billion from € 44, 782 billion in 2003. The first agricultural budget for the EU- 25 will be in 2004 and will total € 47, 885 billion. Expenditures on rural development are set at € 4, 803 billion for the EU- 15 and € 6, 536 billion for the EU 25. A briefing by the US Department of Agriculture on the EU 2004 budget notes that the US$/€ exchange rate is having {{a profound effect on}} EU export-refund expenditures, with export refunds on arable crops rising from € 104 million in 2003 to € 532 million in 2004. Significantly, the outcome of CAP reform is expected to have minimal impact on the 2004 budget, since the reforms will only be felt from 2005 onwards. Comment: The USDA review of the EU 2004 agricultural budget highlights a 33 % increase in EU expenditures on food safety. It should be noted that many food-safety measures were formerly categorised under the sectoral budget of the sector concerned. Their removal into a separate budgetary category removes them from the EU's self-imposed <b>ceiling</b> on <b>CAP</b> expenditures. Similarly {{it should be noted that}} rural-development expenditures have been removed from the formal calculation of the expenditures to which the new EU budgetary ceiling applies. It should also be noted that the EU contribution to rural-development programmes constitutes only around 50 % of the total financing made available to such programmes, with member governments, and occasionally private-sector associations, providing the remainder. This highlights the extent to which the EU will be expanding agricultural support in those areas not subject to ceilings.

40|$|Despite {{the rapid}} growth in the {{employment}} of women in the U. S. workforce, women continue to encounter barriers in general management and executive positions. These barriers have been described as a 2 ̆ 2 glass ceiling 2 ̆ 2 for women (Morrison et al., 1987). The <b>ceiling</b> is a <b>cap</b> beyond which women find it difficult to break into higher level positions because of sociological restrictions which have the effect of limiting their opportunities for career development. The U. S. Merit System Protection Board (MSPB) (1992) conducted a survey of federal employees as to whether these barriers to career advancement also restrict the government workforce. The conclusion of the MSPB study was that a glass ceiling truly exists in the federal government. Concurrent with the MSPB study, the authors conducted a survey of the USDA Forest Service to see if these barriers exist in this traditionally male-dominated agency. They then compared the re- sults of the MSPB study with their research to see whether career paths for women in the Forest Service differed significantly from the opportunities of female employees throughout the federal government...|$|R
50|$|Prior to the 2004-05 NHL lockout, teams {{could spend}} as much or as little as they wanted, {{therefore}} most offer sheets were matched. This caused offers to restricted free agents to be rare to avoid ill will amongst general managers; there were no offer sheets made in the six {{years prior to the}} lockout. Beginning with the 2005 NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement, the NHL assigned a salary <b>cap</b> <b>ceiling</b> and floor for each season, so teams must spend money more wisely. This means {{it is more likely that}} general managers will offer a contract to a younger player with potential that their team does not see as much value in matching, rather saving money for other players. This also leads to teams signing their own players to long-term contracts before they are eligible for restricted free agency, possibly locking them in at a lower rate than they will have to pay later, depending on each player's future performance; contracts cannot be renegotiated under the current CBA. A potential benefit to a player whose current team matches an offer sheet is that the player cannot be traded for the next calendar year.|$|R
5000|$|Reed's {{execution}} {{was set for}} 6pm on Friday June 20, 2008, but {{a series}} of appeals stopped the execution from occurring until 11:20pm, when the curtains were opened so that witnesses could view the execution. Reed was strapped into the chair, with a strap or mask that covered most of his head. Electrodes were connected to his head through a wire that could be seen connecting from the <b>ceiling</b> to a <b>cap</b> on his head and another wire was connected to the calf of his right leg. Reed was not seen to look at anyone and he declined to state any last words. He had earlier also declined to opt for a last meal or any spiritual advisor. After his declination to last words was announced, a leather hood was tied around his head. When the switch was thrown, witnesses heard a noise similar to the sound made by the key ring clip lock on a gas station pump handle when the tank is [...] "full". The sound indicated that the circuit of the electric chair had been completed and current was now passing into Reed's body. Reed jerked forward, but other than that there was no significant movement. The electrodes were disconnected at 11:25pm and he was pronounced dead at 11:27pm.|$|R
