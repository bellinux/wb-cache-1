50|$|There was no Puritan view against {{beauty in}} the arts, and {{therefore}} no objection to visual fineries; however, the pragmatism intrinsic to the Puritan mindset limited the amount of art produced in the Americas. The practical activities of life generally outweighed any sort of extravagance in the Puritan community. Aside from embellishments on buildings and small decorations in the home, however, paintings also surfaced during the era that the Puritans occupied the land. The Freake paintings by the Freake-Gibbs painter as well as Captain Thomas Smith's self-portrait each represent a Puritan and therefore show Puritan involvement in blatantly visual arts. Aside from the rare paintings as mentioned above, Puritan women <b>created</b> <b>handicrafts.</b>|$|R

By combining the knowledge gained through my former education as an avionics technician with my interest in the ancient ceramic craft, I strive to <b>create</b> kinetic ceramic <b>handicraft</b> suitable for interaction with an audience. By a series of different phases I slowly go from understanding what kind of motion I want my objects to have, to actually realizing this motion in three-dimensional objects. Through the use of simple models made from corrugated fiberboard followed by more advanced plaster models, combined with different complementary materials such as bicycle inner-tubing and recycled aluminium cans among many others, I, through a vast series of testing, slowly build up a knowledge base later applied to the ceramic objects. The result is for me a success; I {{have found a way}} for me to combine ceramics with mechanics.

40|$|Abstrak: Bangli {{is one of}} the regencies in Bali {{which has}} various unique and {{interesting}} industries of handicrafts.

These industries of handicrafts are highly supported by the natural sources available especially bamboo and wood.

This industry is very unique and special and can only be done by some craftsmen in Bangli. 	The development of tourism industry in Bali has allowed the craftsmen in Bangli to move and <b>create</b> various <b>handicrafts</b> for the tourists visiting Bali. The industries which have been developing are not only limited to those who have been {{there for a long time}} but also those which are newly established and have been influenced by the centers of handicrafts developing in the other regions. By utilizing the natural resources available such as wood and bamboo, many centers of handicraft industries are developing in Bangli. Such a development cannot be separated from the influence given by Gianyar as one of the centers of handicrafts in Bali. 	Handicraft industry contributes a lot to the government of Bangli and its community. It has widely opened job opportunities for the community members to develop it to minimize unemployment.

The job opportunities available are not only limited to those for men but also for housewives who used to be made busy with the work in the kitchen. Now they are having side jobs by developing some of the industries. The school children are too. They are involved in the industries made available by the environment where they live.
