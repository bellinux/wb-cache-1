5|$|One {{section of}} the M11 {{extension}} was due to tunnel under George Green in Wanstead. Residents had believed that this would save their green, and a 250-year-old sweet chestnut tree that grew upon it, but {{because this was a}} <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnel,</b> this required the tree to be cut down.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, Turner Construction {{was awarded}} the $105 million {{construction}} contract to build and finish Capitol Hill station's interior and entrances. Turner began interior construction in March 2013, using an unusual steel truss support system to pour concrete for station elements. Construction on the west entrance and its <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnel</b> under Broadway began in November 2013 and required lane shifts on Broadway throughout 2014. By the summer of 2015, work on Capitol Hill station was declared 90 percent complete, and the construction wall was gradually removed.|$|E
5|$|When the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western {{expanded}} the Kingsland Shops in 1903, a new station depot was constructed of brick {{along with a}} <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The tunnel itself cost $71,500 (1903 USD) and permitted the local street, Schuyler Avenue to cross over the rail line. The new station depot was built on Ridge Road over the tracks, with platforms crossing over the new bridge. The design of the station depot located above the tracks was later replicated by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western's Montclair Branch for its Watsessing Avenue station in Bloomfield, New Jersey.|$|E

50|$|Adana Metro is a 13.9 km long {{double track}} rail line, of which 3.5 km is {{underground}} (in <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnels),</b> 2.5 km is in trench, 5.3 km is elevated, and 2.55 km is at-grade.|$|R
50|$|The Connectus {{consortium}} (McConnell Dowell and Hawkins) will {{construct the}} <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnels</b> under <b>and</b> along Albert St from Customs St to Wyndham St. The work started in October 2015 with {{the relocation of}} a major stormwater line in Albert St between Swanson and Wellesley Sts.|$|R
5|$|The {{station was}} opened as Westminster Bridge on 24 December 1868 by the steam-operated District Railway (DR) (now the District line) when the railway opened {{the first section}} of its line from South Kensington. It was {{originally}} the eastern terminus of the DR and the station cutting ended at a concrete wall buffered by timber sleepers. The approach to the station from the west runs in <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnel</b> under the roadway of Broad Sanctuary and diagonally under Parliament Square. In Broad Sanctuary the tunnel is close to Westminster Abbey and St Margaret's church and care was required to avoid undermining their foundations when excavating in the poor ground found there.|$|E
25|$|In July 2007, Auckland City Council commissioners gave {{approval}} to widening the approach motorway for the bridge through Onehunga Bay, but opposed the new interchange design {{north of the}} bridge favoured by Transit, which intended to construct it around 7 m high over Gloucester Park and the Hopua volcanic tuff ring. The Council's preferred version was to build the interchange at ground level with part of the motorway in a <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnel.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{same year}} the first {{underground}} station was opened in Erandio, {{on the existing}} Bilbao-Plentzia railway. In 1989 construction began in the city centre, where the main Moyúa square was closed to pedestrians until 1997. Construction was especially complicated in the neighbourhoods of Deusto and San Inazio, where the <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnel</b> excavation damaged some buildings, was very noisy, and caused severe traffic disruptions. This method of excavation contrasted with the tunnel-boring machines used elsewhere in the city.|$|E
50|$|Depending on wind direction, {{wind speed}} trend and weather {{forecast}} the trains can operate in winds of 60 to 75 mph. As the train approaches the top station it enters a 250 m <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>tunnel</b> taking {{it up to}} the top platform hidden in the hillside.|$|R
50|$|A {{second phase}} of the project was to have been an ambitious {{underground}} line through the city centre to create a circular route for suburban passenger services. The proposal had experienced strong opposition from the City Council as there would be <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnels</b> through Edinburgh New Town, and as the line was principally intended for passenger operation, it was not proceeded with. Electric street trams were operating in Leith from 1905.|$|R
50|$|Tunnelling works {{under the}} city streets {{commenced}} in June 1972, using a tunnel boring machine built by Richmond engineering firm Jaques Limited,. as well as conventional boring methods. At North Melbourne, Spencer Street <b>and</b> Jolimont Yard, <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnelling</b> was used to build the access ramps, with the above ground running lines being slewed {{from time to time}} as work proceeded. The first completed tunnel was the Burnley Loop, with the final breakthrough made on 8 June 1977 near the Museum station site.|$|R
25|$|In 1995 it was {{proposed}} {{to build a}} tunnel for the A303 underneath the World Heritage Site. A conference agreed on a 2.5-mile (4km) bored tunnel, however the government instead proposed a <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnel,</b> with plans being published in 1999. These plans were criticised by the National Trust, Transport 2000 and others who expressed concern that it would cause damage to archaeological remains along the route, destroy ancient sites and not achieve an improvement in the landscape.|$|E
25|$|The review {{presented}} five options — {{the published}} tunnel scheme, a <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnel,</b> a 'partial solution' (involving a roundabout but maintaining the current road), and two overland bypass routes. Some of these {{plans have been}} criticised as being damaging to both archaeology and biodiversity, including the stone curlew, barn owls, bats, and the chalk grassland habitat. Five options were considered including diverting the A303 further away and only closing the A344. The group expected to produce a report in 2006, {{taking into account the}} results of public consultation which started on 23 January 2006 and ran until 24 April 2006.|$|E
25|$|East of Westbourne Park {{the line}} passes beneath the Great Western main line before {{resurfacing}} at Royal Oak station and running alongside {{the tracks of}} the main line to an island platform {{just north of the}} suburban platforms at Paddington station. The line enters a <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{at the end of the}} platforms and meets the District line and the other end of the Circle line from Bayswater at Praed Street Junction before passing through Edgware Road station in a cutting. After King's Cross St Pancras station the line exits the tunnel before passing under the Ray Street Gridiron that carries the City Widened Lines which are currently used by Thameslink services. The line continues underground after Farringdon station; there are bay platforms at Moorgate station.|$|E

50|$|A first {{planning}} {{statement for}} the Mannheim-Stuttgart route {{was published in}} 1974. The Federal Ministry of Transport issued the building permit in 1975, and construction commenced in 1976. More than 6,000 objections led to some route changes during the construction. The construction of some sections was at times completely halted. In seven places the protests of the nearby residents led to the building of <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The longest tunnel of this kind was the Pfingstberg tunnel, which leads through a forest, a declared water protection zone, near Mannheim-Rheinau.|$|R
50|$|Neu-Ulm {{station is}} located {{southeast}} of the city centre of Neu-Ulm. Bahnhofstrasse (station street) runs to the northwest of the station and Meininger Allee runs to the southeast. To the southwest is the station building and the bus station, where Hermann Koehl-Straße also crosses the tracks. In the northeast is the station’s parking lot; north of it Reuttier Straße crosses the tracks. Both the bus station and the parking lot are built {{on the roof of}} the <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnels</b> that the rail tracks run through. The station’s address is Julius-Rohm-Platz 1.|$|R
500|$|Some of the {{recommended}} improvements, {{such as the}} roundabout, replacement Maroon Creek Bridge, and improvements to the intersections along Highway 82 between {{the city and the}} airport, have been implemented. Right-of-way easements have been acquired for a new two-lane parkway, as authorized by voters, that would cross the Holden/Marolt property via a [...] <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnel</b> to reconnect to the existing highway at Main and Seventh streets. City voters also authorized light rail for that route.|$|E
500|$|The {{project was}} officially {{designated}} the [...] "Bay Freeway" [...] by the Seattle City Council on April 12, 1967, {{as part of}} an ordinance that also renamed part of State Route 99 to the Alaskan Freeway and officially named the proposed R.H. Thomson Expressway as the Thomson Freeway. During the second public hearing, held on June 23, the city council endorsed the $5 million elevated option for the Bay Freeway amid appeals from local architects and the Citizens Planning Council. Among the 16 proposals considered, a <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnel</b> was rejected because of its $16 million cost, steep grades and larger disruption of local businesses and railroads. The Seattle Center was selected as the preferred site of the multi-purpose domed stadium in 1968, assuming that the Bay Freeway was built to prevent event congestion, forcing the project to be redesigned for the next two years.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{the railway}} the Metropolitan had opened in 1863, the route {{did not follow}} an easy {{alignment}} under existing roads and land values were higher, so compensation payments for property were much higher. To ensure ventilation, the line west of Gloucester Road was carried in open cuttings, the rest mainly in a <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnel</b> [...] wide and [...] deep; at the stations the platform ends were left open. Construction costs and compensation payments were so high {{that the cost of}} the first section of the District from South Kensington to Westminster was £3 million, almost three times the cost of the Met's original, longer line. On 24 December 1868, the District opened its line from South Kensington to Westminster, with stations at South Kensington, Sloane Square, Victoria, St. James's Park and Westminster Bridge (now Westminster), the Met extending eastwards from Brompton to a shared station at South Kensington on the same day.|$|E
5|$|The Suburbs Line runs between Bondi Junction in Sydney's {{east and}} Eveleigh, {{just south of}} the Sydney central {{business}} district. It is mostly underground, and consists of 7 kilometres of bored tunnels and 1.5 kilometres of <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnels,</b> with only 2 kilometres above ground. In the Eastern Suburbs, three tunnels proceed in a westerly direction from Bondi Junction via Edgecliff and Kings Cross; in each of these tunnels there are stations. Between Bondi Junction and Edgecliff there is a short open-air cutting in Woollahra, and between Edgecliff and Kings Cross there is a short viaduct over Rushcutters Bay.|$|R
50|$|In 1990 the Medway Tunnel Act {{was passed}} {{granting}} the Rochester Bridge Trust {{the power to}} build and own the tunnel. The work, which {{was carried out by}} an HBM Civil Engineering / Tarmac Construction joint venture, started in May 1992. The tunnel was constructed in three distinct sections. The centre part of the tunnel is the 370 metres of immersed tube, which is linked to <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnels</b> on both the Strood and Chatham banks of the river. The Medway Tunnel was opened by the Princess Royal in June 1996. In 1996, it won an award from the UK’s Concrete Society.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} Highway 140 begins in May 1966, when the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority {{received}} Federal {{approval for the}} Welland Bypass, a 13.4 km channel that would serve to bypass the canal through downtown Welland, where several crossings {{proved to be a}} hazard for shipping traffic and the shipping traffic an impediment to pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The new channel would be dug out and flooded,providing the opportunity for the construction of cheap <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnels</b> beneath the channel. By 1968, construction was underway on tunnels at East Main Street and at the Port Colborne - Welland townline.|$|R

2500|$|The {{first modern}} light rail cars began {{operation}} from South Hills Village to Castle Shannon on April 15, 1984 with the downtown subway {{added to the}} system on July 3, 1985. [...] The last leg of the modern suburban [...] "Beechview" [...] line (from Castle Shannon to South Hills Junction via Mt. Lebanon and Beechview) was approved for funding May 8, 1985 with $20 million in federal grants and completed the modern system on May 22, 1987 at a total cost of $522 million. [...] The suburban line in the south hills were former streetcar lines that had been rehabilitated to accommodate light rail vehicles. [...] The Beechview line was reconstructed (being completely double tracked) and routed from the South Hills Junction through the Mount Washington Transit Tunnel, emerging at a newly constructed station at Station Square before crossing the Monongahela river on the Panhandle Bridge (a former railway bridge), which then led into a newly built downtown (<b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> <b>tunnel)</b> subway with four stations, which incorporated the nineteenth century Pittsburgh & Steubenville Extension Railroad Tunnel. [...] The downtown subway had four stations, Steel Plaza, Wood Street, Gateway Center, and Penn Station. [...] The original subway branched north of Steel Plaza, with one branch heading west to Wood Street and one branch heading east to Penn Station.|$|E
