40|$|The {{rolling contact}} fatigue is {{distinguished}} into subsurface initiated (spalling and case crushing) and surface initiated (pitting and micropitting). A characteristic depth was identified {{for each of}} these mechanism. The characteristic depth of the case crushing is the hardening depth, while for the spalling it is the maximum cyclic shear stress depth. The pitting depth is the size of the crack for which the mode I stress intensity factor range, due to the fluid pressurization, is higher than the threshold. This depth can be similar to the micropitting depth, in the order of 10 µm, for heavily loaded small radius <b>contacts.</b> <b>Rolling</b> <b>contact</b> fatigue cyclic shear stress indexes are then defined {{on the basis of the}} characteristic depths, and they identify the load intensity of each rolling contact fatigue mechanism.

40|$|In {{order to}} solve the serious backup roll {{spalling}} of roughing mill during ultra-wide stainless steel rolling process, a 3 D elastic deformation finite element model of 4 -high roll stacks was established for simulating the mechanical behavior during the hot rolling process. The asymmetric contact pressure between backup and work rolls is the key factor for the frequent roll spalling accidents. Based {{on the principle of}} homogenizing <b>contact</b> pressure between <b>rolls,</b> minimizing harmful <b>contact</b> zone in different strip widths and considering roll wearing as a whole, SCR (Smart <b>Contact</b> Backup <b>Rolls)</b> was developed. The simulation reveals when using the SMS 200 backup roll contour, the peak position of contact pressure keeps consistent with the practical spalling position. Instead, the peak value of the <b>roll</b> <b>contact</b> pressure with SCR technology decreases significantly with various strip widths. The unevenness coefficients of <b>roll</b> <b>contact</b> pressure with SCR technology decline sharply from 1. 36 and more to less than 1. 18 with different strip widths. The roll consumption decreases from 0. 1254 kg/t to 0. 055 kg/t.

40|$|High quality {{silicon nitride}} {{ceramics}} have shown some advantages for {{rolling element bearing}} applications. In particular hybrid bearings (silicon nitride rolling elements and steel races) {{have the ability to}} withstand high loads, severe environments and high speeds. However, the difficulties of both sintering and machining the material may result in surfacedefects,such as surface ring cracks. It is difficult to detect surface ring cracks during high volume production processes and hence it is crucially important to understand their influence and the fundamental mechanism of the failures they cause. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the contact fatigue failure modes of silicon nitride rolling elements with surface ring crack defects. In this study, new experimental and computational techniques are developed to measure and model the interaction of the surface with pre-existing crack defects. A rolling contact fatigue test method is devised for positioning the ring crack in the <b>contact</b> path. <b>Rolling</b> <b>contact</b> fatigue tests are conducted using a modified four-ball machine in a hybrid ceramic/steel combination. A three-dimensional boundary element model is used to determine the stress intensity factors and to carry out the crack face contact analysis. Research shows that the RCF life performance of silicon nitride bearing elements is dependent upon the crack location and fatigue spall happens only at a few crack orientations. The spalling fatigue failure is not only influenced by the original ring crack propagation but also strongly influenced by the subsequent crack face contact. Secondary surface cracks play an important role in the forination of a fatigue spall. The crack gap and crack face friction coefficients significantly affect the formation of secondary surface cracks. Numerical calculation results are consistent with the experimental observations. A quantitative three-dimensional boundary element model has been developed, which can be used to determine the geometry of acceptable surfacering cracks. ...|$|R
