The flakes of frozen water remain {{in the press and}} only the sweet juice flows. This is the {{principle}} of ice wine. Cryoextraction is a recent technique invented to reproduce the phenomenon in the regions which are not cold enough: the grapes are artificially frozen before being pressed. This method overcomes the climate and harvesting work can continue without waiting for the frosts (risk of loss of the grapes by weather accident or attack by hungry sparrows), but shortening the maturation does not give the same flavour.|$|E

40|$|Bulky {{transparent}} ceramic, especially spinel (MgAl 2 O 4), can be {{used for}} applications such as high-energy laser windows and lightweight armor. One of the traditional routes to manufacture transparent spinel plates includes the steps of material preparation, uniaxial <b>pressing,</b> <b>cold</b> isostatic <b>pressing</b> (CIP), de-bindering and hot isostatic pressing (HIP).

40|$|In {{this study}} {{hardness}} and densification behaviour of copper and bronze powders under wet bag cold isostatic and uniaxial die pressing processes are examined. In uniaxial pressing the specimens were compacted up to a pressure of 800 MPa. <b>Cold</b> isostatic <b>pressing</b> (CIP) resulted in better densification {{for both of}} the studied powder materials.
