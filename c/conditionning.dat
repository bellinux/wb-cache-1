40|$|Abstract. In {{the context}} of {{nonlinear}} regression, we consider the problem of explaining a variable y from a vector x of explanatory variables and from a vector t of <b>conditionning</b> variables, that influences the link function between y and x. A neural based solution is proposed {{in the form of}} a field of nonlinear regression models, by which it is meant that the relation between those variables is modeled by a map from some space to a function space. This approach results in a broader class of neural models than that of perceptrons, which therefore inherits the interesting approximation theoretical properties of the latter. The interest of such a modeling is illustrated by a real-world geophysical application, namely ocean color remote sensing. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{glass-ceramic}} matrices {{designed for the}} <b>conditionning</b> of minor actinides, in which zirconolite crystals (CaZrTi 2 O 7) are homogeneously dispersed in a residual glassy matrix. Good immobilization performances require a high enrichment of actinides in the crystalline phase (double containment principle). Glass-ceramics are obtained by controlled devitrification of an aluminosilicate parent glass containing large amounts of TiO 2 and ZrO 2. Neodymium was selected to simulate the trivalent minor actinides. Crystallization was performed at 1200 °C for various Nd 2 O 3 contents (0 - 10 wt. %). In all cases, zirconolite crystallization is obtained in the bulk of glass-ceramics. The evolution of Nd 3 + location between the crystals and the residual glass was followed by electron spin resonance and optical absorption. Both techniques demonstrate that neodymium is partly incorporated in zirconolite crystals. Moreover, total Nd 2 O 3 content in parent glass has a strong effect on Nd 3 + ions distribution...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a renewal {{process that is}} conditioned {{on the number of}} events in a fixed time horizon. We prove that a centered and scaled version of this process converges to a Brownian bridge, as the number of events grows large, which relies on first establishing a functional strong law of large numbers result to determine the centering. These results are consistent with the asymptotic behavior of a conditioned Poisson process. We prove the limit theorems over triangular arrays of exchangeable random variables, obtained by <b>conditionning</b> a sequence of independent and identically distributed renewal processes. We construct martingale difference sequences with respect to these triangular arrays, and use martingale convergence results in our proofs. To illustrate how these results apply to performance analysis in queueing, we prove that the workload process of a single server queue with conditioned renewal arrival process can be approximated by a reflected diffusion having the sum of a Brownian Bridge and Brownian motion as input to its regulator mapping.

Late <b>conditionning</b> by {{a return of}} the walk to zero at time n provides discrete bridges that we note (Bj) 1 ≤j≤n. We give in this extended abstract the asymptotic law in the central domain of the height (max 1 ≤j≤n Bj) of the bridges as n tends to infinity. As expected, this law converges to the Rayleigh law which is {{the law of the}} maximum of a standard Brownian bridge. In the case where c = 1 (only one negative jump), we provide a full expansion of the asymptotic limit which improves upon the rate of convergence O(log(n) / √ n) given by Borisov [4] for lattice jumps; this applies in particular for the case where Xi ∈ {− 1, +d}, in which case the expansion is expressible as a function of n, d and of the height of the bridge. Applying this expansion for Xi ∈ {− 1, d/c} gives an excellent approximation of the case Xi ∈ {−d, +c} and provides in constant time an indicator used in ranking statistics; this indicator can be used for medical diagnosis and bioinformatics analysis (see Keller et al.
