At the time, it {{was reported}} that Bethesda only used the game for the reveal trailer and that it was not officially releasing on the Nintendo Switch. On January 13, 2017, Todd Howard officially confirmed that the game will <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Nintendo Switch, making it the first Elder Scrolls title to be released on a Nintendo platform, as well as the first game Bethesda has made or released for a Nintendo home console since Home Alone for the NES in 1991.

25|$|One of {{the most}} revolutionary {{products}} to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market was the company's disposable Pampers diaper, first test-marketed in 1961, the same year Procter & Gamble came out with Head & Shoulders. Prior to this point, disposable diapers were not popular, although Johnson & Johnson had developed a product called Chux. Babies always wore cloth diapers, which were leaky and labor-intensive to wash. Pampers provided a convenient alternative, albeit at the environmental cost of more waste requiring landfilling.|$|E

Over 50 Iraqis were killed by terrorist bombs targeting these crowds. In the other semi-finals, Saudi Arabia topped defending champions Japan 3–2 to make an all-Arab affair for the final match.|$|E

500|$|Lukather {{describes}} 1997's Luke as a {{much different}} and more [...] "introspective" [...] album than his previous two solo efforts. The album is a concentrated collection of many of Lukather's musical influences, and he deliberately let those influences <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album. Luke is an experimental album, and like Candyman it was recorded mostly in live sessions with minimal overdubbing and processing afterwards. Luke also features instrumentation not heard on previous Lukather albums: pedal steel, Harmonicas, Mellotrons, and experimental guitar, bass, and drum sounds. The US version of Luke includes {{a version of the}} Jeff Beck song [...] "The Pump". [...] The song [...] "Hate Everything About U" [...] was released as a single.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Pitt portrayed Tyler Durden in Fight Club, a film {{adaptation}} of Chuck Palahniuk's {{novel of the}} same name, directed by David Fincher. Pitt prepared for the part with lessons in boxing, taekwondo, and grappling. To look the part, Pitt consented to the removal of pieces of his front teeth which were restored when filming ended. While promoting Fight Club, Pitt said that the film explored not taking one's aggressions out on someone else but to [...] "have an experience, take a punch more and see how you <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other end." [...] Fight Club premiered at the 1999 Venice International Film Festival. Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole, Pitt's performance was widely praised. Paul Clinton of CNN noted the risky yet successful nature of the film, while Variety remarked upon Pitt's ability to be [...] "cool, charismatic and more dynamically physical, perhaps than... his breakthrough role in Thelma and Louise". In spite of a worse-than-expected box office performance, Fight Club became a cult classic after its DVD release in 2000.|$|E

On the surface she’s sexy, stylish, clever, and together but below the surface, Ridge and Taylor's only surviving daughter is emotionally starved and slowly learning how to love and be loved". By 2011, Wood described Steffy as a [...] "rich bitch" [...] and stated, [...] "I love playing her and developing her character. She is so different from me. It's rather cathartic, and it allows my alter ego to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Bold and The Beautiful set five days a week." [...] CBS Soaps In Depth characterized Steffy as {{the soap opera}}'s [...] "resident diva". When asked if Steffy was [...] "a little bit nuts", Wood said: [...] "yes, she's a mess.

He'd say, 'Hey you—strong guy!'" [...] On June 5, Koback played both games of a doubleheader against Cincinnati. In the first game, he appeared as a defensive replacement as the catcher. In his only at-bat that game, which was against Reds pitcher Johnny Klippstein, Koback flied out. Koback started the second game of the doubleheader.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, comedian Rick Mercer — who had {{previously}} made an earlier, more lighthearted [...] "It Gets Better" [...] video — devoted a weekly [...] "rant" [...] on Rick Mercer Report to an updated comment on the subject, making an impassioned plea for LGBT public figures to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds that Hubley's death had made it unacceptable to stay silent anymore. Mercer — who first came out as gay in 2009 — faced some criticism for not explicitly reminding viewers in the video that he is gay himself; he subsequently appeared on CBC Radio One's The Current {{to talk about the}} video and his own experience as a gay man.|$|E

The game ended when, with 16 seconds left, Simpson dived into the endzone as the ball was knocked out of his hands. It was ruled a touchdown and Virginia defeated Maryland. Terps coach Ralph Friedgen said [...] "I saw the ball <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> goal line. I saw it and I don't think he had possession." [...] Simpson himself stated, [...] "It crossed the line. I knew I scored because I looked down and saw the yellow line and I saw the ball cross [...] they hit it out." [...] With the victory, the Cavaliers reached seven wins in a row {{for the first time since}} 1990 and for only the fourth time in school history. They also accomplished the feat in 1914 and 1949.

2500|$|... 2007 saw Keating’s side {{taken on}} Limerick in their opening game. [...] It {{was a game}} that Tipp were {{expected}} to win, however, Limerick put up a good fight and the game ended in a draw. [...] For the replay of the game Keating made the drastic move of dropping legendary goalkeeper Brendan Cummins. [...] The second game saw Keating’s side lead by ten points at one stage, however, {{by the end of}} the seventy minutes both sides were level once again. [...] A period of extra-time failed to separate these two sides were forced to meet for a third time. [...] Once again extra-time had to be played, however, after nearly four hours of hurling Limerick emerged as the winners. [...] After the defeat Keating looked less than impressed when he was forced to do a television interview alongside ecstatic Limerick manager Richie Bennis. [...] The All-Ireland qualifiers saw Keating’s side win all of their games, including a victory over Cork for the first time since 1991. [...] It looked as if Tipp had <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> easy side of the draw as their opponents, Wexford, were not regarded as being up to much. [...] Because of this Keating may have been guilty of having one eye on the All-Ireland semi-final. [...] His decision to relegate star forward Eoin Kelly to the substitutes bench baffled many, particularly since Kelly tops the chart as Tipp’s all-time top scorer. [...] The game itself was an exciting one, however, a Damien Fitzhenry penalty sealed the victory for Wexford and dumped Tipp out of the championship. [...] Keating resigned as manager shortly after this defeat.|$|E
