5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some {{within the field of}} attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe <b>child</b> <b>maltreatment,</b> which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors. The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. Resilience is a common and normal human characteristic. RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in foster children, adoptive children, or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.|$|E

25|$|Child {{abuse is}} the {{physical}} or psychological/emotional mistreatment of children. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) define <b>child</b> <b>maltreatment</b> as any act or series of acts of commission or omission by {{a parent or}} other caregiver that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child. Most child abuse occurs in a child's home, with a smaller amount occurring in the organisations, schools or communities the child interacts with. There are four major categories of child abuse: neglect, physical abuse, psychological/emotional abuse, and sexual abuse.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, {{children}} had few protections from violence by their parents, {{and in many}} parts of the world, this is still the case. For example, in Ancient Rome, a father could legally kill his children. Many cultures have allowed fathers to sell their children into slavery. Child sacrifice was also a common practice. <b>Child</b> <b>maltreatment</b> began to garner mainstream attention with the publication of [...] "The Battered Child Syndrome" [...] by pediatric psychiatrist C. Henry Kempe. Prior to this, injuries to children—even repeated bone fractures—were not commonly recognized as the results of intentional trauma. Instead, physicians often looked for undiagnosed bone diseases or accepted parents' accounts of accidental mishaps such as falls or assaults by neighborhood bullies.|$|E

"By {{the early}} 21st century, {{the issue of}} child sexual abuse has become a {{legitimate}} focus of professional attention, while increasingly separated from second wave feminism...As child sexual abuse becomes absorbed into the larger field of interpersonal trauma studies, child sexual abuse studies and intervention strategies have become degendered and largely unaware of their political origins in modern feminism and other vibrant political movements of the 1970s.

2500|$|According to the APSAC Task Force, these therapies are {{sufficiently}} prevalent to have prompted position statements or specific prohibitions against using coercion or restraint {{as a treatment}} by mainstream professional societies such as: American Psychological Association (Division on <b>Child</b> <b>Maltreatment),</b> National Association of Social Workers (and its Utah Chapter), American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and American Psychiatric Association. The Association for the Treatment and Training in the Attachment of Children, (ATTACh), an organization for professionals and families associated with attachment therapy, has also issued statements against coercive practices. Two American states, Colorado and North Carolina, have outlawed rebirthing. There have been professional licensure sanctions against some leading proponents and successful criminal prosecutions and imprisonment of therapists and parents using attachment therapy techniques. Despite this, the treatments appear to be continuing among networks of attachment therapists, attachment therapy centers, caseworkers, and adoptive or foster parents.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{identify}} contextual {{and interpersonal}} factors that distinguish families {{in which the}} intergenerational transmission of maltreatment is maintained from families in which the cycle is broken. METHODS: The sample was composed of 1, 116 families in the United Kingdom {{who participated in the}} Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study. We assessed mother's childhood history of maltreatment retrospectively with a validated and reliable interview. Prospective reports of children's physical maltreatment were collected repeatedly up to 12 years. We compared families in which mothers but not <b>children</b> had experienced <b>maltreatment</b> with families in which both mothers and <b>children</b> had experienced <b>maltreatment,</b> and with families without maltreatment, on a range of contextual and interpersonal factors known to affect child development. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, supportive and trusting relationships with intimate partners, high levels of maternal warmth toward children, and low levels of partner violence between adults distinguished families in which mothers but not <b>children</b> experienced <b>maltreatment</b> from families in which mothers and <b>children</b> experienced <b>maltreatment.</b> Families in which only mothers experienced maltreatment were largely similar to families in which neither generation experienced maltreatment, except that mothers belonging to the former group {{were more likely to have}} a lifetime history of depression and low levels of social support. CONCLUSIONS: Safe, stable, nurturing relationships between intimate partners and between mothers and children are associated with breaking the cycle of abuse in families. Additional research is needed to determine whether these factors have a causal role in preventing the transmission of maltreatment from one generation to the next...|$|R
