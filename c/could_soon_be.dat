5|$|The city of Bastogne, Belgium was a hub {{of several}} major roads {{and became a}} prime target for the Germans, seeing its capture as {{necessary}} to their advance. Middleton was in continuous communication with Bradley at 12th Army Group headquarters in Luxembourg, and maintained that though Bastogne <b>could</b> <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> surrounded, it should be held. As the Germans advanced on Bastogne, both Bradley and First Army commander Hodges recognized the threat to Middleton and had him move his headquarters. He was supposed to leave Bastogne on 18 December, but spent another night there {{so that he could}} brief his relief force, the 101st Airborne Division. Not only did that division's acting commander, Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe, show up ahead of schedule, but so did Colonel William Roberts from the 10th Armored Division Combat Command R (CCR), sent by Patton. Another welcome guest arriving later that evening was Major General Matthew Ridgway, commander of XVIII Airborne Corps, en route to his headquarters, but advised by Middleton to stay in Bastogne for the night to avoid capture by the Germans. While Middleton and his guests slept, elements of the 101st Airborne poured into Bastogne all during the night and into the following day.|$|E

500|$|Area Congressman John Doolittle {{was one of}} {{the largest}} proponents of the Auburn Dam, and he {{appropriated}} several million dollars for funds to conduct feasibility studies for the dam. About $3 million went into the main feasibility report, and the remaining $1 million was used for a study concerning the relocation of California State Route 49, which runs through the site. After the Hurricane Katrina disaster in 2005, Doolittle drew public attention to the flood vulnerability of the Sacramento region. He also used the flood-protection [...] "incompetence" [...] of the Folsom Dam to his advantage, saying that [...] "without an Auburn Dam we <b>could</b> <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> in the unenviable position of suffering from both severe drought and severe flooding in the very same year." [...] He led all 18 Republican members of the United States House of Representatives from California in a protest in 2008, trying to convince Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to revoke the water-rights decision that California had made against Reclamation. Doolittle is sometimes known as the Auburn Dam's [...] "chief sponsor".|$|E

2500|$|The {{prediction}} that light represented a {{transmission of energy}} in wave form through a [...] "luminiferous ether", and the seeming confirmation of that prediction with Helmholtz student Heinrich Hertz's 1888 detection of electromagnetic radiation, was a major triumph for physical theory and raised the possibility that even more fundamental theories based on the field <b>could</b> <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> developed. Experimental confirmation of Maxwell's theory was provided by Hertz, who generated and detected electric waves in 1886 and verified their properties, {{at the same time}} foreshadowing their application in radio, television, and other devices. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered the photoelectric effect. Research on the electromagnetic waves began soon after, with many scientists and inventors conducting experiments on their properties. In the mid to late 1890s Guglielmo Marconi developed a radio wave based wireless telegraphy system (see invention of radio).|$|E

Dion championed a [...] "new industrial revolution" [...] focused on [...] "environmentally sustainable technologies and products", and he sought to nurture a collaborative relationship with big business rather than a confrontational one. His maiden speech before the Calgary Chamber of Commerce illustrates just how accommodating {{he was ready to}} be: [...] "Calgary is one of Canada's most impressive economic engines.... Alberta <b>could</b> <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> the second-largest oil-exporting jurisdiction on Earth, behind Saudi Arabia. This is tremendous blessing for Canada."

2500|$|In the beginning, the sect's mostly Mormon neighbors took little {{notice of}} the newcomers, {{generally}} tolerant of their unorthodox beliefs. Then on February 11, 1935 {{a member of the}} group named Edith Peshak died of cancer. She and her husband had joined in search of a promised spiritual cure for her disease. Marie Ogden claimed that Peshak {{was in a state of}} purification and <b>could</b> <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> brought back to life. On April 4, 1935, her newspaper column included a section entitled [...] "The Rebirth of a Soul", which detailed Ogden's conversations with the dead woman and her beliefs about raising her from the dead. Ogden still had the corpse, which was being washed three times a day in a salt solution and [...] "fed" [...] milk and eggs by injection. Rumors spread through the Monticello area, and at last the county sheriff came to Home of Truth in June 1935 to investigate the stories. The authorities found Peshak's body well preserved. They decided to allow the colony to keep it, as they determined it was no health threat, and since a number of people in the area had old Indian mummies found in dry caves.|$|E

40|$|Most {{patients}} with cancer experience fatigue, a severe activity-limiting symptom with a multifactorial origin. To avoid cancer-related fatigue, patients are frequently advised to seek periods of rest {{and to reduce}} their amount of physical activity.

However, such recommendations can paradoxically compound symptoms of fatigue, since sedentary habits induce muscle catabolism and thus cause a further decrease in functional capacity.
