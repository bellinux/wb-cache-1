60|$|The Species of Tits as Illustrating Areas of Distribution.--In our own {{hemisphere}} {{the overlapping}} of allied species may be well {{illustrated by the}} various kinds of titmice, constituting the genus Parus, several of which are among our best known English birds. The great titmouse (Parus major) has the widest range of all, extending from the Arctic circle to Algeria, Palestine, and Persia, and from Ireland right across Siberia to the Ochotsk sea, probably following the great northern forest belt. It does not extend into China and Japan, where distinct species are found. Next in extent of range is the <b>coal</b> <b>tit</b> (Parus ater) which inhabits all Europe from the Mediterranean to about 64° N. latitude, in Asia Minor to the Lebanon and Caucasus, and across Siberia to Amoorland and Japan. The marsh tit (Parus palustris) inhabits temperate and south Europe from 61° N. latitude in Norway to Poland and South-west Russia, and in the south from Spain to Asia Minor. Closely allied to this--of which it is probably only a variety or sub-species--is the northern marsh tit (Parus borealis), which overlaps the last in Norway and Sweden, and also in South Russia and the Alps, but extends further north into Lapland and North Russia, and thence probably in a south-easterly direction across Central Asia to North China. Yet another closely-allied species (Parus camtschatkensis) ranges from North-eastern Russia across Northern Siberia to Lake Baikal and to Hakodadi in Japan, thus overlapping Parus borealis in the {20} western portion of its area. Our little favourite, the blue tit (Parus coeruleus) ranges over all Europe from the Arctic circle to the Mediterranean, and on to Asia Minor and Persia, but {{does not seem to}} pass beyond the Ural mountains. Its lovely eastern ally the azure tit (Parus cyaneus) overlaps the range of P. coeruleus in Western Europe as far as St. Petersburg and Austria, rarely straggling to Denmark, while it stretches all across Central Asia between the latitudes 35° and 56° N. as far as the Amoor valley. Besides these wide-ranging species there are several others which are more restricted. Parus teneriffæ, a beautiful dark blue form of our blue tit, inhabits North-west Africa and the Canaries; Parus ledouci, closely allied to our <b>coal</b> <b>tit,</b> is found only in Algeria; Parus lugubris, allied to the marsh tit, is confined to South-east Europe and Asia Minor, from Hungary and South Russia to Palestine; and Parus cinctus, another allied form, is confined to the extreme north in Lapland, Finland, and perhaps Northern Russia and Siberia. Another beautiful little bird, the crested titmouse (Parus cristatus) is sometimes placed in a separate genus. It inhabits nearly all Central and South Europe, wherever there are pine forests, from 64° N. latitude to Austria and North Italy, and in the west to Spain and Gibraltar, while in the east it does not pass the Urals and the Caucasus range. Its nearest allies are in the high Himalayas.|$|E

40|$|Predators {{may either}} learn to avoid aposematic prey or may avoid {{it because of}} an innate bias. Learned as well as innate {{avoidance}} has been observed in birds, but the existing evidence is based on experiments with rather few unrelated model species. We compared the origin of avoidance in European species of tits (Paridae). First, we tested whether wild-caught birds (blue tits, great <b>tits,</b> crested <b>tits,</b> <b>coal</b> <b>tits,</b> willow tits, and marsh tits) avoid aposematic (red and black) adult firebugs Pyrrhocoris apterus (Heteroptera) more than nonaposematic (brown painted) ones. Larger proportion of birds avoided aposematic than brown-painted firebugs in majority of species (except <b>coal</b> <b>tits).</b> Second, we tested whether naive hand-reared birds of 4 species (blue tits, great tits, crested <b>tits,</b> and <b>coal</b> <b>tits)</b> attack or avoid aposematic and nonaposematic firebugs, both novel for them. Behavior of the naive blue <b>tits</b> and <b>coal</b> <b>tits</b> {{was similar to that}} of the wild-caught birds; majority of them did not attack the firebugs. Contrastingly, the naive great tits and crested tits behaved differently than the wild-caught conspecific adults; majority of the wild-caught birds avoided the aposematic firebugs, whereas the naive birds usually did not show any initial avoidance and had to learn to avoid the aposematic prey. Our results show that the origin of avoidance may be different even in closely related species. Because blue <b>tits</b> and <b>coal</b> <b>tits</b> avoided not only aposematic firebugs but also their brown-painted form, we interpret their behavior as innate neophobia rather than innate bias against the warning coloration.

40|$|Capsule Siskins and <b>Coal</b> <b>Tits</b> {{were present}} in gardens more often in years of poor Sitka Spruce cone crops, with {{synchrony}} across the UK. Aims To examine how the relative abundances of Siskins and <b>Coal</b> <b>Tits</b> in a garden in western Scotland varied annually {{with the size of}} the spruce cone crop, and to determine whether this pattern was similar nationally. Methods A ten-year mist-netting data set from Tarbet, Argyll and Bute was used to test the hypothesis that some species utilize supplementary food in gardens more often in years with poor cone crops than in years when crops are large. Annual peaks in the relative abundances of four species (two that ate conifer seed and two that did not) in Tarbet were correlated with a Sitka Spruce masting index. BTO Garden BirdWatch data from six regions of the UK were correlated with the Tarbet data, the cone index and each other {{to determine the extent of}} synchrony. Results Both Siskins and <b>Coal</b> <b>Tits</b> were present more often in the Tarbet garden in years with poor cone crops, with relative abundances significantly negatively correlated with cone crop for both species (r = - 0. 739 and - 0. 832, respectively). Correlations between regions using BTO data showed abundances of species in gardens to be broadly similar across the UK. Independent scores of cone abundance in Kielder and Galloway were correlated. Correlations between BTO data, cone index and Tarbet garden data were mostly high and almost all in the same direction, also indicating a degree of synchrony in cone production across the UK. Conclusion Both Siskins and <b>Coal</b> <b>Tits</b> appear to be influenced by changes in cone abundance, switching to feed on supplementary food in gardens more often in years with few cones than in mast years. While such a relationship has been shown previously for Siskins, for <b>Coal</b> <b>Tits</b> this is a novel resul...|$|R
60|$|One of {{the curious}} {{results of the}} general action of this {{principle}} in nature is, that the most closely allied species--those whose differences though often real and important are hardly perceptible to any one but a naturalist--are usually {{not found in the}} same but in widely separated countries. Thus, the nearest allies to our European golden plover are found in North America and East Asia; the nearest ally of our European jay is found in Japan, although there are several other species of jays in Western Asia and North Africa; and though we have several species of titmice in England they are not very closely allied to each other. The form most akin to our blue tit is the azure tit of Central Asia (Parus azureus); the Parus ledouci of Algeria is very near our <b>coal</b> <b>tit,</b> and the Parus lugubris of South-Eastern Europe and Asia Minor is nearest to our marsh tit. So, our four species of wild pigeons--the ring-dove, stock-dove, rock-pigeon, and turtle-dove--are not closely allied to each other, but each of them belongs, according to some ornithologists, to a separate genus or subgenus, and has its nearest relatives in distant parts of Asia and Africa. In mammalia the same thing occurs. Each mountain region of Europe and Asia has usually its own species of wild sheep and goat, and sometimes of antelope and deer; so that in each region there is found the greatest diversity in this class of animals, while the closest allies inhabit quite distinct and often distant areas. In plants we find the same phenomenon prevalent. Distinct species of columbine are found in Central Europe (Aguilegia vulgaris), in Eastern Europe, and Siberia (A. glandulosa), in the Alps (A. Alpina), in the Pyrenees (A. pyrenaiea), in the Greek mountains (A. ottonis), and in Corsica (A. Bernardi), but rarely are two species found in the same area. So, each part of the world has its own peculiar forms of pines, firs, and cedars, but the closely allied species or varieties are in almost every case inhabitants of distinct areas. Examples are the deodar of the Himalayas, the cedar of Lebanon, and that of North Africa, all very closely allied but confined to distinct areas; and the numerous closely allied species of true pine (genus Pinus), which almost always inhabit different countries or occupy different stations. We will now consider some other modes in which natural selection will act, to adapt organisms to changed conditions.|$|E

40|$|Current theory predicts small birds {{should have}} a reduced body mass when daytime {{predation}} risk is high. However, the influence that nighttime predators might have on changes in body mass or daytime foraging behaviour has not been addressed. We therefore studied the effect of changes in perceived nocturnal predation risk on the body mass of captive <b>coal</b> <b>tits.</b> In a soundproof room, eight <b>coal</b> <b>tits</b> were housed in individual cages and an experiment was performed in which the birds were subjected to two treatments. First, morning and evening body mass was monitored following nights that were quiet. Second, these parameters were measured following nights when the call of a tawny owl had been played once per hour. Evening body mass was 3 % greater on days following owl-disturbed nights, but morning body masses did not differ between treatments. To ensure this result {{was a response to}} the owl calls per se, and not a general response to increased disturbance, a second experiment was necessary. Here the <b>coal</b> <b>tits</b> were exposed hourly to the calls of a nightjar, a non-predatory nocturnal bird, but no increases in body mass were observed compared to quiet nights. We suggest the <b>coal</b> <b>tits</b> increased body mass in response to owl calls to offset increased nighttime energy expenditure in attentive behaviour.

40|$|I {{investigated}} the spatial memory abilities of male rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) on their breeding grounds, where birds {{can be readily}} trained to feed from artificial flowers presented in two- and three-dimensional arrays. I found that birds use height as a cue when encoding flower locations, preferring to visit taller flowers. Performance in three-dimensional arrays is not however consistently better than in 2 -D arrays. I also examined the possibility that hummingbirds follow a fixed flight path when returning to an array of flowers, as has {{been seen in the}} Hymenoptera. By manipulating the number of doors by which a bird could enter an arena to feed on an array of flowers, I found some evidence that birds do use systematic movements when relocating rewarding sites. Rufous hummingbirds feed on floral nectar, a resource that varies in time as well as space. To determine whether these birds use time as a cue when foraging, I provided them with an array in which flowers were refilled after intervals of either ten or twenty minutes. The birds were able to learn these intervals, as they returned to flowers on or shortly after their expected refill time. I used an analogous experiment to investigate timing abilities in <b>coal</b> <b>tits</b> (Parus ater), a food-storing species, and great tits (P. major), a non food-storing species, in the laboratory. Storers and nonstorers might differ in their ability to time intervals due to the demands, on storers, of reliable cache recovery. <b>Coal</b> <b>tits</b> were able to track the availability of rewards in three different locations associated with reward schedules in the 30 - 120 s range.

40|$|In {{species that}} form social {{foraging}} groups during {{all or part}} of their lifecycle, individuals are subject to costs in terms of a higher frequency of aggressive interactions and having to share resources with group members, which must be outweighed by the benefits of flocking for all individuals concerned if it is to remain an Evolutionary Stable Strategy. In many group living species, dominance hierarchies exist that reduce the need for repeated agonistic interactions between the same individuals, which use valuable energy and may result in injury. Dominance hierarchies allow the most dominant individuals priority of access to contested resources whilst subdominant individuals may suffer as a consequence. In this thesis, I examined how dominance hierarchies were structured in great tits, blue <b>tits</b> and <b>coal</b> <b>tits</b> and how dominance status affected an individual's foraging efficiency and body condition. The food handling times or vigilance levels of great tits and blue tits were not governed by dominance status but dominant <b>coal</b> <b>tits</b> were less vigilant than subdominant conspecifics thus probably allowing more time for foraging and other social activities i. e. mate finding and territory defence. Though subdominant great tits did not suffer costs in terms of food handling times, they were affected more by interference competition when foraging in mixed tit flocks compared to dominant great tits. Using ptilochronology as a measure of nutritional condition, the results from <b>coal</b> <b>tits</b> in this study contradicted those of previous studies in that dominant <b>coal</b> <b>tits</b> had slower rates of feather growth and produced feathers that were shorter and less dense than subdominant conspecifics, possibly a cost of their high dominance. Feather growth rate in great tits and blue tits was not related to dominance status. The immunocompetence of adult great tits or blue tits was not governed by dominance status nor did great tit or blue tit nestlings show any relationship between their place in the brood competitive hierarchy and immuocompetence.
