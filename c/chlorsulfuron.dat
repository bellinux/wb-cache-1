In addition, a sensitive wheat cultivar, Rongotea, was selected {{and the effect of}} different levels of nitrogen on its response to <b>chlorsulfuron</b> was evaluated, and the mode of action of <b>chlorsulfuron</b> in this sensitive wheat cultivar was investigated. Thirteen wheat cultivars showed differential sensitivity to post-emergence applications of <b>chlorsulfuron</b> at rates from 0 to 90 g a. i. ha⁻¹. Five cultivars were chosen and tested in further experiments under glasshouse and field conditions. Cultivar 'Kotare' was found to be tolerant of <b>chlorsulfuron</b> and showed no injury symptoms at application rates of 15 or 60 g a. i. ha⁻¹. Cultivars 'Lancer' and 'Rongotea' showed early damage in pot and field experiments at both rates of the herbicide, and there were yield reductions in pot experiments. Cultivars' Abele' and 'Jasper' were intermediate in their response to <b>chlorsulfuron.</b> Retention, uptake, translocation and distribution pattern of <b>chlorsulfuron</b> was similar between the five cultivars studied. Metabolism of <b>chlorsulfuron</b> was found to be more rapid in 'Kotare' than 'Lancer' or 'Rongotea'. Within 48 h of application, Kotare metabolised 92. 2 % of 14 C- <b>chlorsulfuron,</b> while Lancer and Rongotea metabolised only 43. 5 % and 63 % of the herbicide, respectively. The concentration of <b>chlorsulfuron</b> in young tissues of Kotare, Lancer and Rongotea at this time was calculated as 1. 2, 31. 9 and 15. 6 ng g⁻¹ dry weight, respectively. It was concluded that differential rates of metabolism were the main basis for differences in sensitivity to <b>chlorsulfuron</b> between the wheat cultivars tested. Rongotea wheat showed greater reduction in dry weight following <b>chlorsulfuron</b> application when grown at high (5 mol m⁻³) than low (1 mol m⁻³) nitrate. No differences were found in retention, uptake, translocation or metabolism of the herbicide between plants grown at either nitrate level. Moreover, plants grown at low nitrate and transferred to high nitrate at spraying showed similar growth reductions to plants grown at high nitrate throughout. It was concluded that low nitrate prior to spraying does not result in increased tolerance to <b>chlorsulfuron</b> and that another mechanism must be involved. <b>Chlorsulfuron</b> limited the capacity of wheat to respond to additional nitrate. This was not through an interference with uptake or assimilation of nitrogen as these processes were not affected by <b>chlorsulfuron.</b> Sprayed plants accumulated reduced N indicating an inability to utilize assimilated nitrogen for growth. Supplying branched chain amino acids (BCAA), which are associated with the mode of action of <b>chlorsulfuron,</b> partially overcame the restriction on growth imposed by <b>chlorsulfuron.</b> This was not a specific BCAA effect as supplying glutamine plus glutamate gave a similar response. Leaf extension, acetol act ate synthase (ALS) activity, valine content and its proportion of the total free amino acid pool was decreased rapidly following <b>chlorsulfuron</b> application. This is strong evidence that the initial effect of <b>chlorsulfuron</b> in restricting growth of Rongotea wheat was through inhibiting the activity of ALS. Moreover, plants kept on high nitrate following spraying accumulated nitrate to toxic levels. This was shown to be the main reason for decreased growth in the long term. Plants kept on low nitrate and transferred to high nitrate three weeks after spraying could respond to nitrate. In addition, it was found that ALS activity returned to normal at this time. It is likely therefore, that accumulation of nitrate in high-nitrate-fed plants was related to the effect of <b>chlorsulfuron</b> on the target enzyme. However, other possibilities are not discounted...|$|E

The increased metabolism of <b>chlorsulfuron</b> observed in the cross-resistant biotype is, therefore, correlated with the patterns of resistance observed in these L. rigidum biotypes.

40|$|<b>Chlorsulfuron,</b> an {{inhibitor}} of acetolactate synthase (EC 4. 1. 3. 18) (TB Ray 1984 Plant Physiol 75 : 827 - 831), markedly inhibited {{the growth}} of Lemna minor at concentrations of 10 − 8 molar and above, but had no inhibitory effects on growth at 10 − 9 molar. At growth inhibitory concentrations, <b>chlorsulfuron</b> caused a pronounced increase in total free amino acid levels within 24 hours. Valine, leucine, and isoleucine, however, became smaller percentages of the total free amino acid pool as the concentration of <b>chlorsulfuron</b> was increased. At concentrations of <b>chlorsulfuron</b> of 10 − 8 molar and above, a new amino acid was accumulated in the free pool. This amino acid was identified as α-amino-n-butyrate by chemical ionization and electron impact gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The amount of α-amino-n-butyrate increased from undetectable levels in untreated plants, to as high as 840 nanomoles per gram fresh weight (2. 44 % of the total free pool) in plants treated with 10 − 4 molar <b>chlorsulfuron</b> for 24 hours. The accumulation of this amino acid was completely inhibited by methionine sulfoximine. <b>Chlorsulfuron</b> did not inhibit the methionine sulfoximine induced accumulations of valine, leucine, and isoleucine, supporting {{the idea that the}} accumulation of the branched-chain amino acids in methionine sulfoximine treated plants is the result of protein turnover rather than enhanced synthesis. Protein turnover may be primarily responsible for the failure to achieve complete depletion of valine, leucine, and isoleucine even at concentrations of <b>chlorsulfuron</b> some 104 times greater than that required to inhibit growth. Tracer studies with 15 N demonstrate that <b>chlorsulfuron</b> inhibits the incorporation of 15 N into valine, leucine, and isoleucine. The α-amino-n-butyrate accumulated in the presence of <b>chlorsulfuron</b> and [15 N]H 4 + was heavily labeled with 15 N at early time points and appeared to be derived by transamination from a rapidly labeled amino acid such as glutamate or alanine. We propose that <b>chlorsulfuron</b> inhibition of acetolactate synthase may lead to accumulation of 2 -oxobutyrate in the isoleucine branch of the pathway, and transamination of 2 -oxobutyrate to α-amino-n-butyrate by a constitutive transaminase utilizing either glutamate or alanine as α-amino-N donors...|$|E

Similar extractable activities and affinities for acetyl-coenzyme A of carboxylase (ACCase), an enzyme inhibited by diclofop-methyl, were found for susceptible and resistant L. rigidum. ACCase activity from both biotypes was inhibited by diclofop-methyl, diclofop acid, haloxyfop acid, fluazifop acid, sethoxydim, and tralkoxydim but not by <b>chlorsulfuron</b> or trifluralin. Exposure of plants to diclofop-methyl did not induce any changes in either the extractable activities or the herbicide inhibition kinetics of ACCase. It is concluded that, in contrast to diclofop resistance in L. multiflorum and diclofop tolerance in many dicots, the basis of resistance to diclofop-methyl and to other aryloxyphenoxypropionate and cyclohexanedione herbicides in L. rigidum is not due to the altered inhibition characteristics or expression of the enzyme ACCase.

40|$|Sulfonylurea {{residues}} {{have been}} found to inhibit the growth of some legume crops and pastures in seasons following application. Negative effects of these herbicides on symbiotic nitrogen fixation by legume crops and pastures have been demonstrated. Reductions in nitrogen fixation may result from a direct effect of the herbicide on rhizobial growth and/or an indirect effect on plant growth. In this study the influence of <b>chlorsulfuron</b> on the growth of chickpea rhizobia [Mesorhizobium ciceri (CC 1192) ], the growth of chickpea plants, and the extent of nodulation and nitrogen fixation by the chickpea/rhizobia symbiosis were examined. In vitro studies (in yeast mannitol broth and a defined medium) showed that <b>chlorsulfuron</b> applied at double the recommended field application rate did not influence the growth of chickpea rhizobia. An experiment using ¹⁴C-labelled <b>chlorsulfuron</b> was conducted to determine if rhizobial cells exposed to <b>chlorsulfuron</b> could deliver the herbicide to the point of root infection and nodule formation. Approximately 1 % of the herbicide present in the rhizobial growth medium remained with the cell/inoculum material after rinsing with 1 / 4 strength Ringer’s solution.

40|$|Field {{investigations}} of the transport and fate of the sulfonylurea herbicide, <b>chlorsulfuron</b> and the s-triazine herbicide atrazine were carried out in several cropping soils in the Wimmera-Mallee region of Victoria between 1991 and 1995. The containment of these herbicides within topsoil {{by the use of}} controlled-release formulations was also examined in field and laboratory experiments. Concentrations of atrazine and <b>chlorsulfuron</b> were measured for 11 and 17 -month periods after the application of each respective herbicide, in a sandy loam at Walpeup in the Mallee. These results showed that the mobility of the two herbicides were different. Atrazine was mainly retained within topsoil while <b>chlorsulfuron</b> rapidly leached to the subsoil. Analyses of soil water fluxes and weather data for this period showed that the mobility of atrazine was governed by sorption while <b>chlorsulfuron</b> mobility was largely due to mass flow. The rapid leaching of <b>chlorsulfuron</b> was also confirmed in further studies in a Wimmera grey clay and a Kattyoong sand. While the leaching of atrazine was minimal, it was estimated that absolute residue levels that could reach groundwater depths would be higher than <b>chlorsulfuron</b> due to substantially higher rates of application of atrazine in commercial practice. The first order rates of degradation of atrazine and <b>chlorsulfuron,</b> within the rootzone of the Walpeup sandy loam, were calculated to be 62 and 75 days, respectively. The persistence of residues in the Walpeup sandy loam, at the phytotoxic threshold of several crops that are sensitive to each respective herbicide, were 11 and 17 months for atrazine and <b>chlorsulfuron,</b> respectively. The leaching of the herbicides was found to be an important determinant of their persistence. The relatively lower persistence of atrazine could be explained by its retention in topsoil where microbial and hydrolytic breakdown of the herbicide is at a maximum, whereas the rapid transport of <b>chlorsulfuron</b> to subsoil increased its persistence. Plant-back experiments for up to two years after application of <b>chlorsulfuron</b> in the Wimmera grey clay resulted in injury to annual medics suggesting that the productivity of medic leys in similar soils would be under threat {{for at least two years}} after the application of the herbicide.

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} cell culture {{establishment}} and a somatic cell selection system optimized for {{the isolation of}} chlorsulfuron-resistant variants in asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.). The development of this cell selection system benefited the isolation of chlorsulfuron-resistant variants from an elite asparagus genotype. A cell culture system, suitable for somatic cell selection, was established for asparagus genotype CRD 168. Friable callus was initiated from etiolated shoots in darkness and used to produce a high density of single cells in suspension. Cell density was estimated based on a linear relationship with settled cell volume. A mean plating efficiency of 0. 19 % was recorded between 1 - 4 x 10 ⁵ cells/Petri dish. In vitro cell selection techniques were developed to identify mutant asparagus cells with resistance to a sulfonylurea herbicide, <b>chlorsulfuron.</b> A few key aspects were important to achieve this: a cell culture system for cell selection was initially established; a toxic concentration for the complete growth inhibition of the wild type asparagus cells was defined; rare, resistant cell colonies were isolated and characterized; and chlorsulfuron-resistant plants were regenerated. From about 50 million cells, 165 cell colonies were isolated {{in the presence of}} 8 nM <b>chlorsulfuron.</b> Characterization of these selected cell colonies yielded 24 escapes, 98 unstable variants, and 43 stable-resistant variants. Callus cultures from 34 of these stable variants retained resistance following 11 months growth {{in the absence of the}} selection agent. Plants were regenerated from 36 of these stable herbicide-resistant variants. Six of these chlorsulfuron-resistant variants were screened for their degree of resistance to <b>chlorsulfuron,</b> cross resistance to other acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) inhibiting herbicides and AHAS enzyme activity. Cross resistance to imazamox was evident in four of the resistant variants, while lack of cross resistance to metsulfuron methyl was observed in all six resistant variants. A varying degree of resistance to <b>chlorsulfuron</b> was observed among the resistant variants. Both in the original and secondary callus, an uninhibited AHAS enzyme activity in all six resistant variants was recorded in the presence of high <b>chlorsulfuron</b> concentration (70 - 140 nM), compared to the total inhibition in the wild type. One chlorsulfuron-resistant variant, R- 45, was used to compare the biochemical and physiological basis of resistance with the wild type. The AHAS enzyme activity in the tissue culture and greenhouse foliage of R- 45 was significantly higher in the presence of up to 280 nM <b>chlorsulfuron</b> compared with the wild type. <b>Chlorsulfuron</b> retention was considerably higher due to the reduction of epicuticular wax deposits on the foliage of R- 45, in comparison with the wild type.

By contrast, differences in ALS specific activity in roots of plants both at the five- and three-leaf stages of growth were significantly correlated (r = 0. 96 ** and r = 0. 93 **, respectively) with in vivo tolerance. Correlation was also noted in extracts from cultured excised root tips (r = 0. 94 **). Callus tissue of a chlorsulfuron-tolerant line was less affected by the herbicide and had a significantly higher ALS specific activity than callus from a <b>chlorsulfuron</b> susceptible line, whereas inhibition of ALS by the herbicide was similar in both lines.

Place and Duration of Study: A series of laboratory and greenhouse experiments was undertaken at the College of Agricultural Studies, Sudan University of Science and Technology (SUST) at Shambat, during the season 2013 / 2014. Methodology: Striga free or infested soil was placed in plastic pots (9 cm i. d) with perforations at the bottoms. Pots filled with Striga free soil (0 mg) were included as control for comparison. Sorghum cultivar Wad-Ahmed was sown as sole crop or intercropped with cowpea. <b>Chlorsulfuron</b> at 1. 3 g active ingredient (a. i) /fed was applied three weeks after sowing. Plant height and Stem diameter were measured in centimetres using a ruler and vernier caliper instrument, respectively, while weight was weighed in gram after drying using a balance. Results: At 60 and 75 days after sowing (DAS), irrespective of Striga seed bank size, cowpea intercropped with sorghum displayed significant reduction in stem diameter (19. 0 - 56. 7 %). Sorghum intercropped with cowpea at Striga seed bank size of 16 mg/pot resulted in a significant reduction in sorghum dry weight (61. 6 %). However, at 60 and 75 DAS displayed a significant reduction in sorghum height only at the seed bank size of 16 mg/pot. <b>Chlorsulfuron</b> applied to Sole sorghum at Striga seed bank size of 16 mg/pot reduced sorghum dry weight by 51. 9 %. Sorghum intercropped with cowpea and subsequently treated with <b>chlorsulfuron</b> at Striga seed bank size of 16 mg/pot decreased sorghum height significantly (20. 8 – 29. 5 %). Sorghum intercropped with cowpea and subsequently treated with <b>chlorsulfuron,</b> irrespective of Striga seed bank size, reduced sorghum dry weight (28. 1 - 47. 6 %). Conclusion: According to this study, Striga management requires integrated practices comprising different components.

40|$|Abstract- Sulfonylureas are a {{relatively}} new class of herbicides characterised by several aspects that make them particularly interesting in comparison with other products. Two microbial consortia able to grow on two sulfonylureas, <b>chlorsulfuron</b> and metsulfuron-methyl, were selected in laboratory conditions using as inocula soil samples previously treated with sulfonylurea herbicides and from a laboratory enrichment culture obtained with <b>chlorsulfuron.</b> From these mixed cultures, a Pseudomonas fluorescens strain called B 2, was able to degrade in co-metabolic conditions with a rich medium in two weeks about 21 % of metsulfuron-methyl and 32 % of <b>chlorsulfuron.</b> For both herbicides, three microbial metabolites were detected and characterized, suggesting two different degradation path-ways in which the cleavage of sulfonylurea bridge takes place.

However, these studies tend to be anecdotal, without side by side comparisons for a single species or natural isolate. In this study, we tested the frequencies of resistance of three herbicides in a controlled ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) saturation mutagenesis experiment, allowing a direct comparison of the frequencies at which resistant mutant plants arise. The 100 % growth inhibition dose rates of glyphosate, <b>chlorsulfuron</b> (a sulfonylurea herbicide), and imazethapyr (an imidazolinone herbicide) were determined for Arabidopsis. Populations of EMS-mutagenized M 2 seedlings were sprayed with twice the 100 % growth inhibition dose of glyphosate, <b>chlorsulfuron,</b> or imazethapyr, and herbicide-resistant mutants were identified. Although there were no glyphosate-resistant mutants among M 2 progeny of 125, 000 Columbia and 125, 000 Landsberg erecta M 1 lines, <b>chlorsulfuron</b> resistance and imazethapyr resistance each appeared at frequencies of 3. 2 � 10 � 5.

GH 50 is tolerant of <b>chlorsulfuron,</b> a herbicide of the sulfonylurea class. Tobacco protoplasts were cotransfected with genomic DNA and the plasmid pHP 23 which confers kanamycin resistance. A high frequency of cointegration of the plasmid and the genomic DNA was expected, which would allow the tagging of the plant selectable trait with the plasmid DNA. After transfection by electroporation the protoplasts were cultivated on regeneration medium supplemented with either <b>chlorsulfuron</b> or kanamycin as a selective agent. Selection on kanamycin yielded resistant calluses at an absolute transformation frequency (ATF) of 0. 8 x 10 (- 3). Selection on <b>chlorsulfuron</b> yielded resistant calluses at an ATF of 4. 7 x 10 (- 6). When a selection on <b>chlorsulfuron</b> was subsequently applied to the kanamycin resistant calluses, 8 % of them showed resistance to this herbicide. Southern analysis carried out on the herbicide resistant transformants detected the presence of the herbicide resistance gene of Arabidopsis into the genome of the transformed tobacco. Segregation analysis showed the presence of the resistance gene and the marker gene in the progeny of the five analysed transformants. 3 transformants showed evidence of genetic linkage between the two genes.

Three biotypes were identified taxonomically: var. arvense; var. horridum, and var. vestitum. Out of the three identified biotypes, only var. arvense showed more sensitivity to <b>chlorsulfuron,</b> while the other two biotypes were less sensitive. There was no difference in the germination behaviour of the biotypes, thus all varieties can be present on the field at the same time.

There is no significant difference between sensitive and resistant biotypes in absorption and translocation of the 14 C <b>chlorsulfuron</b> and florasulam.

40|$|The {{sulfonylurea}} herbicide <b>chlorsulfuron</b> and the imidazolinone herbicide imazaquin {{were shown}} to be noncompetitive and uncompetitive inhibitors, respectively, of purified acetolactate synthase from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) with respect to pyruvate. From double-reciprocal plots of the time-dependent biphasic inhibition by <b>chlorsulfuron,</b> an initial apparent inhibition constant of 68 nanomolar was calculated (a 0 to 4 minute assay {{was used for the}} initial inhibition), and a final steady-state dissociation constant of 3 nanomolar was estimated.

Specific binding of [14 C]chlorsulfuron and [14 C]imazaquin to purified acetolactate synthase from barley and partially purified enzyme from corn (Zea mays L.) could be demonstrated by gel filtration and equilibrium dialysis. Evidence is presented that the binding of the inhibitors to the enzyme follows the previously described mechanism of slow reversibility once excess inhibitor has been removed.

As a result of extensive and intensive selection of pre- and -post emergence herbicides, Palmer amaranth has evolved resistance to multiple herbicide modes of action, microtubule-, 5 -enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase (EPSPS) -, acetolactate synthase (ALS) -, photosystem II (PS II) -, hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) - and more recently to protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) -inhibitors. A Palmer amaranth population from Kansas was found resistant to HPPD-, PS II-, and ALS-inhibitors. The overall objective of this research was to investigate the target-site and/or non-target-site resistance mechanisms in Palmer amaranth from KS (KSR) to mesotrione (HPPD-inhibitor), atrazine (PS II-inhibitor), and <b>chlorsulfuron</b> (ALS-inhibitor) relative to known susceptible Palmer amaranth from Mississippi (MSS) and KS (KSS). Whole plant dose-response assays showed high level of resistance in KSR to mesotrione, atrazine and <b>chlorsulfuron.</b> KSR was 10 - 18, 178 - 237 and > 275 fold more resistant to mesotrione, atrazine, and <b>chlorsulfuron,</b> respectively, compared to MSS and KSS. Metabolism studies using [¹⁴C] labeled mesotrione and atrazine demonstrated non-target-site resistance to both herbicides, particularly, enhanced metabolism of [¹⁴C] mesotrione likely mediated by cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases and rapid degradation of [¹⁴C] atrazine by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). In addition, molecular and biochemical basis of mesotrione resistance was characterized by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunoblotting. These results showed 4 - 12 fold increased levels of the HPPD transcript and positively correlated with the increased HPPD protein. Sequencing of atrazine and <b>chlorsulfuron</b> target genes, psbA and ALS, respectively, showed interesting results. The most common mutation (serine 264 glycine) associated with atrazine resistance in weeds was not found in KSR. On the other hand, a well-known mutation (proline 197 serine) associated with <b>chlorsulfuron</b> resistance was found in 30 % of KSR, suggesting ~ 70 % of plants might have a non-target-site, possibly P 450 mediated metabolism based resistance. Over all, KSR evolved both non-target-site and target-site based mechanisms to mesotrione and <b>chlorsulfuron</b> with only non-target-site based mechanism of resistance to atrazine leaving fewer options for weed control, especially in no-till crop production systems. Such multiple herbicide resistant Palmer amaranth populations are a serious threat to sustainable weed management because metabolism-based resistance may confer resistance to other herbicides and even those that are yet to be discovered. The findings of this research are novel and valuable to recommend appropriate weed management strategies in the region and should include diversified tactics to prevent evolution and spread of multiple herbicide resistance in Palmer amaranth...|$|E
