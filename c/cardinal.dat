All {{cardinals}} are obliged to attend the General Congregation of Cardinals, except those whose health does not permit, or who are over eighty (but those cardinals may choose to attend if they please). The Particular Congregation, which deals with the day-to-day matters of the Church, includes the <b>Cardinal</b> Camerlengo and the three <b>Cardinal</b> Assistants—one Cardinal-Bishop, one Cardinal-Priest and one Cardinal-Deacon—chosen by lot. Every three days, new <b>Cardinal</b> Assistants are chosen by lot. The <b>Cardinal</b> Camerlengo and <b>Cardinal</b> Assistants are responsible, among other things, for maintaining the election's secrecy.|$|E
5|$|A {{far-reaching}} {{generalization of}} addition of natural numbers is {{the addition of}} ordinal numbers and <b>cardinal</b> numbers in set theory. These give two different generalizations of addition of natural numbers to the transfinite. Unlike most addition operations, addition of ordinal numbers is not commutative. Addition of <b>cardinal</b> numbers, however, is a commutative operation {{closely related to the}} disjoint union operation.|$|E
5|$|At Ambohimanga, as {{in other}} rova sites, the <b>cardinal</b> and {{vertical}} layout of these various traditional components embodies two cosmological notions of space that coexisted in traditional Imerina. The older system governed sociopolitical order and {{was based on the}} concept of the four <b>cardinal</b> points radiating from a unifying center. A more recent system introduced through the astrology of seafaring Arabs governed the spiritual order and placed special significance on the northeast. The sacred eastern portions of Ambohimanga contained structures associated with the veneration of the ancestors, including the royal tombs, basins of holy water used in royal rituals, and numerous Ficus and Draceana trees, which were symbolic of royalty. The northern portion of the site is the location of a courtyard where royal judgments were handed down from atop a prominent granite boulder, in line with the Malagasy association between the northern <b>cardinal</b> point, masculinity, and political power. The houses of the royal wives were formerly located in the southern portion of the site, a <b>cardinal</b> point traditionally associated with femininity and spiritual power. These competing cosmological systems are also reflected in the placement of the city's main gates at <b>cardinal</b> points, as well as the northeastern gates reserved for use by the sovereign and dedicated to their role in sacred rituals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Main Theorem of {{this article}} asserts in part that if an {{extension}} V ⊆ V satisfies the δ approximation and covering properties, then every embedding j: V → N definable in V with critical point above δ is the lift of an embedding j ↾ V: V → N definable in the ground model V. It follows that in such extensions {{there can be no}} new weakly compact <b>cardinals,</b> totally indescribable <b>cardinals,</b> strongly unfoldable <b>cardinals,</b> measurable <b>cardinals,</b> tall <b>cardinals,</b> strong <b>cardinals,</b> Woodin <b>cardinals,</b> supercompact <b>cardinals,</b> almost huge <b>cardinals</b> and so on. This result generalizes the Gap Forcing Theorem of [Ham 01] to a broader class of extensions and to a broader class of embeddings within those extensions. ...|$|R

5|$|If he accepts, and {{is already}} a bishop, he {{immediately}} takes office. If {{he is not a}} bishop, however, he must be first consecrated as one before he can assume office. If a priest is elected, the <b>Cardinal</b> Dean consecrates him bishop; if a layman is elected, then the <b>Cardinal</b> Dean first ordains him deacon, then priest, and only then consecrates him as bishop. Only after becoming a bishop does the pope-elect take office. These functions of the Dean are assumed, if necessary, by the sub-Dean, and if the sub-Dean is also impeded, they are assumed by the senior cardinal-bishop in attendance. In 2005 the Dean himself—Joseph <b>Cardinal</b> Ratzinger—was elected pope. In 2013, the Dean and sub-Dean were not in attendance (over the age limit), and these functions were assumed by <b>Cardinal</b> Giovanni Battista Re.|$|E
5|$|In 1151, David again {{requested}} a pallium for the Archbishop of St Andrews. <b>Cardinal</b> John Paparo met David at his residence of Carlisle in September 1151. Tantalisingly for David, the <b>Cardinal</b> {{was on his}} way to Ireland with four pallia to create four new Irish archbishoprics. When the <b>Cardinal</b> returned to Carlisle, David made the request. In David's plan, the new archdiocese would include all the bishoprics in David's Scottish territory, as well as bishopric of Orkney and the bishopric of the Isles. Unfortunately for David, the <b>Cardinal</b> does not appear to have brought the issue up with the papacy. In the following year the papacy dealt David another blow by creating the archbishopric of Trondheim, a new Norwegian archbishopric embracing the bishoprics of the Isles and Orkney.|$|E
