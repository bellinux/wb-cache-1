40|$|Objective. Non-human primates, dogs, rats, hamsters and ferrets, have {{frequently}} {{been used as}} laboratory animals in periodontal biology and pathology. In the past, mice have been used less for this purpose, but nowadays attract {{a lot of interest}} because gene knockout and transgenic technologies utilize mice primarily. In this study, we investigate the effects of ovariectomy and aging on <b>tooth</b> <b>attachment</b> in female mice. Material and methods. Eight-week-old mice (n= 15) were divided into three experimental groups (control, n= 5; sham-operated, n= 5; ovariectomy, n= 5) and ovaries removed bilaterally. Attachment level, assessed by measuring alveolar bone height and apical termination of the junctional epithelium, was determined 6 weeks post-ovariectomy by digital morphometric analysis in sagittal sections of the mandible. The plasma level of the inflammation marker serum amyloid A (SAA) was determined by ELISA. In another series of experiments, <b>tooth</b> <b>attachment</b> was determined in female mice (n= 7) at 8 – 26 weeks of age. Results. Withdrawal of female sex hormone production by ovariectomy had no effect on alveolar bone height and apical termination of the junctional epithelium. The SAA level in plasma was unaffected by removal of the ovaries, suggesting that systemic inflammation is not induced by ovariectomy. Bone height was similar in mice sacrificed at 8 – 26 weeks of age and apical termination of the junctional epithelium was at the cemento-enamel junction at all ages. Conclusions. Removal of ovarian production of female sex hormones by ovariectomy has no influence on <b>tooth</b> <b>attachment,</b> and further <b>tooth</b> <b>attachment</b> is preserved with age in female mice...|$|R

40|$|Background: Chaperones are {{ubiquitous}} conserved proteins {{critical in}} stabilization of new proteins, repair/removal of defective proteins and immunodominant antigens in innate and adaptive immunity. Periodontal {{disease is a}} chronic inflammatory infection associated with infection by Porphyromonas gingivalis that culminates {{in the destruction of}} the supporting structures of the teeth. We previously reported studies of serum antibodies reactive with the human chaperone Hsp 90 in gingivitis, a reversible form of gingival disease confined to the oral soft tissues. In those studies, antibodies were at their highest levels in subjects with the best oral health. We hypothesized that antibodies to the HSP 90 homologue of P. gingivalis (HtpG) might be associated with protection/resistance against destructive periodontitis. Methodology/Principal Findings: ELISA assays using cloned HtpG and peptide antigens confirmed gingivitis subjects colonized with P. gingivalis had higher serum levels of anti-HtpG and, concomitantly, lower levels of attachment loss. Additionally, serum antibody levels to P. gingivalis HtpG protein were higher in healthy subjects compared to patients with either chronic or aggressive periodontitis.

40|$|Retention {{of teeth}} into {{advanced}} age makes caries and periodontitis lifelong concerns. Dental caries occurs when acidic metabolites of oral streptococci dissolve enamel and dentin. Dissolution progresses to cavitation and, if untreated, to bacterial invasion of dental pulp, whereby oral bacteria access the bloodstream. Oral organisms {{have been linked}} to infections of the endocardium, meninges, mediastinum, vertebrae, hepatobiliary system, and prosthetic joints. Periodontitis is a pathogen-specific, lytic inflammatory reaction to dental plaque that degrades the <b>tooth</b> <b>attachment.</b> Periodontal disease is more severe and less readily controlled in people with diabetes; impaired glycemic control may exacerbate host response. Aspiration of oropharyngeal (including periodontal) pathogens is the dominant cause of nursing home–acquired pneumonia; factors reflecting poor oral health strongly correlate with increased risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. Bloodborne peri-odontopathic organisms {{may play a role in}} atherosclerosis. Daily oral hygiene practice and receipt of regular dental care are cost-effective means for minimizing morbidity of oral infections and their nonoral sequelae. More than 300 individual cultivable species of microbes have been identified in the human mouth [1], with an estimated 1014 individual microscopic organisms occupying the mouth and or-opharynx at a time [2].

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to increase the prevention efficiency of the secondary dentoalveolar deformations based {{on the characteristics of}} their pathogenesis and clinical course. Materials and methods. The results of clinical examination of 120 patients of different age groups (from 30 to 59 years) concerning the characteristics of the types of the secondary dentition deformities are presented in the article. Results. Objective study showed a high degree of deformation development, which arose in half of the cases in patients with existing denture defects. Some factors that influence the type of the secondary deformities and the direction of their development were established. They were the effect of the lost tooth on effective transmission of chewing pressure through the maxillary counterforts (the direction of tooth displacement in case of the secondary deformity was directly opposite to direction of counterforts) and trophic level of the teeth that were deformable or surrounded the area of displacement (displacement of devitalized teeth occurred 30 % more often than displacement of teeth that were innervated and supplied with blood). Radiological diagnosis made it possible to evaluate periodontal changes in case of the secondary deformities, which were characterized by changes in fibers tension of the <b>tooth</b> <b>attachment</b> apparatus.

40|$|Periodontitis is {{a common}} human chronic {{inflammatory}} disease that results {{in the destruction of}} the <b>tooth</b> <b>attachment</b> apparatus and <b>tooth</b> loss. Although infections with periopathogenic bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) are essential for inducing periodontitis, the nature and magnitude of the disease is determined by the host’s immune response. Here, we investigate the role played by the NK killer receptor NKp 46 (NCR 1 in mice), in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. Using an oral infection periodontitis model we demonstrate that following F. nucleatum infection no alveolar bone loss is observed in mice deficient for NCR 1 expression, whereas around 20 % bone loss is observed in wild type mice and in mice infected with P. gingivalis. By using subcutaneous chambers inoculated with F. nucleatum we demonstrate that immune cells, including NK cells, rapidly accumulate in the chambers and that this leads to a fast and transient, NCR 1 -dependant TNF-a secretion. We further show that both the mouse NCR 1 and the human NKp 46 bind directly to F. nucleatum and we demonstrate that this binding is sensitive to heat, to proteinase K and to pronase treatments. Finally, we show in vitro that the interaction of NK cells with F. nucleatum leads to an NCR 1 -dependent secretion of TNF-a. Thus, the present study provides the first evidence that NCR 1 and NKp 46 directly recognize...|$|R

Originally multiple alternative designs were generated and divided into three different categories: tooth material, full or partial jaw, <b>tooth</b> <b>attachment</b> method, sensor type, and alert system. These alternatives were analyzed and the chosen ones were metal teeth for the tooth material, full jaw for the jaw type, fixed with pivot for the attachment method, strain gages on the forceps for the sensor type, and LED for the alarm system. After further analysis {{it was decided that}} the following changes would be made. Instead of having one full jaw, individual teeth were mounted on rectangular prism and cylindrical bases.

40|$|Tooth {{implantation}} provides important phylogenetic {{and functional}} {{information about the}} dentitions of amniotes. Traditionally, only mammals and crocodilians have been considered truly thecodont, because their tooth roots are coated in layers of cementum for anchorage of the periodontal ligament, which is in turn attached to the bone lining the alveolus, the alveolar bone. The histological properties and developmental origins of these three periodontal tissues have been studied extensively in mammals and crocodilians, but {{the identities of the}} periodontal tissues in other amniotes remain poorly studied. Early work on dental histology of basal amniotes concluded that most possess a simplified <b>tooth</b> <b>attachment</b> in which the tooth root is ankylosed to a pedestal composed of "bone of attachment", which is in turn fused to the jaw. More recent studies have concluded that stereotypically thecodont tissues are also present in non-mammalian, non-crocodilian amniotes, but these studies were limited to crown groups or secondarily aquatic reptiles. As the sister group to Amniota, and the first tetrapods to exhibit dental occlusion, diadectids are the ideal candidates for studies of dental evolution among terrestrial vertebrates because they can be used to test hypotheses of development and homology in deep time. Our study of Permo-Carboniferous diadectid tetrapod teeth and dental tissues reveal the presence of two types of cementum, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone, and therefore the earliest record of true thecodonty in a tetrapod. These discoveries in a stem amniote allow us to hypothesize that the ability to produce the tissues that characterize thecodonty in mammals and crocodilians is very ancient and plesiomorphic for Amniota. Consequently, all other forms of tooth implantation in crown amniotes are derived arrangements of {{one or more of these}} periodontal tissues and not simply ankylosis of teeth to the jaw by plesiomorphically retaining "bone of attachment", as previously suggested...|$|R
40|$|The main {{functions}} of estrogen {{are associated with}} reproduction. However, estrogen {{has been shown to}} be of functional importance also in non-classic target organs. Previous studies, especially epidemiologic and clinical ones, have addressed estrogen's influence on periodontitis, suggesting that estrogen has a beneficial effect, but the biological mechanisms have not been identified. Estrogen exerts genomic effects in the target cells by binding to the nuclear receptors, estrogen receptor (ERs), ERalpha and ERbeta. The expression of the two subtypes of ERs varies depending on the tissue. The overall objectives of this thesis were to study the functional importance of estrogen receptors in the periodontium with special focus on inflammation, and stimulators of inflammation and their signaling pathways. The thesis is based on the following five papers. In Paper I, effects of estrogen on E. coli LPS-induced PDL cell production of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are assessed, by using ELISA. Furthermore, effects of LPS and estrogen on the normal characteristics of the PDL cell such as collagen synthesis and cell proliferation is determined by using L-[3 H]proline incorporation and measurement of DNA synthesis, respectively. Key findings: E. coli LPS stimulates PDL cell IL- 6 and MCP- 1 production but has no effect on the normal physiological properties of PDL cells. LPS-induced IL- 6 and MCP- 1 is not reversed by estrogen suggesting that estrogen has no anti-inflammatory effect in these experiments. In Paper II, we investigate the effects of ovariectomy and aging on <b>tooth</b> <b>attachment</b> in female mice by using morphometric analysis. Key findings: Withdrawal of female sex hormone production by ovariectomy has no effect on alveolar bone height and apical termination of the junctional epithelium. In a second series of experiments these parameters are similar in mice sacrificed at 8 - 26 weeks of age, suggesting that <b>tooth</b> <b>attachment</b> is preserved with age in mice within a period of six months. In Paper III, the objective is to investigate the regulation of CCL 2 /MCP- 1, CCL 3 /MIP- 1 alpha, and CCL 5 /RANTES chemokines by estrogen in human PDL cells by determining mRNA transcript levels (using quantitative real-time PCR) and protein levels (using ELISA). Key findings: A physiological concentration of estrogen reduces the expression of CCL 3 mRNA by about 40 % compared to PDL cells treated with LPS alone. In contrast, inter-individual differences in the effects of estrogen on CCL 5 mRNA expression are observed. These findings indicate that estrogen affects chemokine expression in PDL cells showing a complex pattern involving down-regulation as well as up-regulation of chemokines. Estrogen exerts both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects through these mechanisms. In Paper IV, ER expression in human gingival biopsies, and effects of estrogen on cultured gingival epithelial cell (HGEP) proliferation, are investigated. Expression of ERalpha and ERbeta is determined by immunohistochemistry and effects of estrogen on HGEP proliferation monitored by measuring DNA synthesis. Key findings: HGEP cells show strong ERbeta immunoreactivity but low ERalpha immunoreactivity both in vivo and in culture, suggesting that ERbeta is the predominant ER subtype in HGEP. High, but not low, concentrations of estrogen attenuates proliferation of gingival epithelial cells, indicating a concentration-dependent mechanism. In Paper V, the objective is to investigate the effects of LPS from Escherichia coli and Porphyromonas gingivalis on IL- 6 production in human PDL cells and endothelial cells, and the signaling mechanisms involved. Quantitative real-time PCR is used to determine IL- 6 mRNA levels and ELISA to determine IL- 6 protein. Key findings: E. coli LPS (but not P. gingivalis LPS) stimulates IL- 6 production in PDL cells. Treatment with the non-selective nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME reduces IL- 6 by 30 %, while aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase, does not affect IL- 6 levels, showing a mechanism probably involving nitric oxide formation via endothelial nitric oxide synthase.

40|$|Objectives: As the gingival {{epithelial}} cells undergo transition between the surface, crevicular and junctional areas, {{it is reported}} that their resting potential could also get altered due to change/variations in the membrane transport protein composition. Hence, {{the purpose of the}} present study is (i) to study the biophysical properties of the surface, the crevicular, and the junctional epithelial gingival cells and to assess their implications to the cell to cell and the cell to <b>tooth</b> <b>attachment</b> mechanisms; (ii) to study the effect of certain delipidifying agents such as Sodium Deoxycholate (DOC) and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) on the transmembrane electrical activity of the gingival {{epithelial cells}}; and, (iii) to study the histological changes due to these treatments and assess their bearings on the biophysical observations. Materials and Methods: The biophysical and histological investigations on the healthy human gingival epithelium were carried out on the fresh biopsy material obtained from a homogeneous group of willing donors between 11 - 15 years of age, who were advised for extraction of first premolar due to orthodontic reasons. The biophysical measurement involved recording of the transmembrane potentials using glass ultra-microelectrodes. For histologic studies, the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the tissue sections was performed. Results: The mean values of the membrane potential in the three types of the gingival epithelium cells vary appreciably. While it was lowest in the junctional cells (2. 83 ± 0. 98 mV), it was highest in the surface epithelial cells (22. 96 ± 5. 19 mV). The crevicular cells showed a value greater than the junctional cells but lesser than the surface cells (9. 3 ± 1. 73 mV). Conclusion: The membrane transport protein density appears to decrease in the following order: surface > crevicular > junctional cells.

The replacement tooth studied here developed in an inclined position slightly distal of the deciduous parent tooth, similar to another varanoid squamate, the Gila monster Heloderma suspectum. Ground sections and tomographs also demonstrated that the replacement <b>tooth</b> <b>attachment</b> apparatus was entirely intact {{and that there was no}} evidence of mechanical deformation. Sections and tomographs further illustrated that the replacement tooth was located within a bony crypt and the inclination of the crypt matched the inclination of the replacement tooth. These preparations also revealed the presence of a resorption pit within the boundaries of the deciduous tooth that surrounded the developing replacement tooth. This finding suggests that developing mosasaur teeth developed within the walls of resorption pits similar to varanoid tooth germs and unlike developing snake teeth which are surrounded by fibrous connective tissue integuments. Finally, mosasaurs featured pseudo-thecodont tooth implantation with teeth anchored within a socket of mineralized tissue by means of a mineralized periodontal ligament. Together, these data indicate that the moderate inclination of the erupting mosasaur tooth studied here is neither a result of postmortem displacement nor a character representative of snakes, but rather a shared character between Mosasaurs and other varanoids such as Heloderma. In conjunction with the presence of resorption pits and the evidence for pseudothecodont tooth implantation, the tooth eruption and implantation characters described in the present study either place mosasaurs among the varanoids or suggest convergent evolution mechanisms between both clades, with mosasaurs evolving somewhat independently from a common varanoid ancestor...|$|R
