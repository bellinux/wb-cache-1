40|$|SUMMARY: In {{order to}} model the wood {{chipping}} process, the primary process parameters have been identified and their first order interaction studied. The model is analytical and incorporates, in particular, the influence of sliding friction between the wood <b>chipping</b> <b>tool</b> and the log. To estimate {{the accuracy of the}} analytical model, a Finite Element (FE) analysis of the problem considered was also performed. The analytical model and the FE analysis are both restricted to small deformations and linear elastic orthotropic material behaviour. The most severe limitation with both the analytical and the FE model is the assumption of linearly elastic material. On the other hand, it is felt that existing models of anisotropic plasticity in metals are lacking too much of physical relevance, if applied to wood. The analytical model predicts the normal and shear strain distribution in the crack-plane prior to crack initiation. The analytical distributions are in reasonable agreement with the corresponding distribution of the FE analysis. Based on experimental findings, it is suggested that the stress field over the entire crack-plane, in conjunction with the stress field close to the tip of the <b>chipping</b> <b>tool,</b> are critical for chip creation, rather than just the latter.

40|$|SUMMARY: To {{be able to}} {{formulate}} criteria’s for determining {{the onset of the}} creation of a wood chip; it is desirable to be able to study the deformation fields in a vicinity of the edge of the <b>chipping</b> <b>tool.</b> To that end, an experimental setup has been developed in which the chipping can be performed under very well defined conditions. In this setup it is possible to control the rate of indentation of the <b>chipping</b> <b>tool</b> and also to measure the force on the tool. The setup admits also that the angle of the wood specimen with respect to the cutting plane can be varied in both a horizontal and a vertical plane. To determine the deformations, a Digital Speckle Photography (DSP) equipment is used, which together with image processing software makes it possible to determine the strain field {{on the surface of the}} wood specimen. One observation that can be made in these studies is that prior to the creation of a chip, there is a localization of strains in a thin region starting from the edge of the tool and directed parallel to the grain. Another observation made during the experimental work is that there exist different types of fracture processes, each giving different chip thicknesses. Flisningsprocesse...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} program chipping, {{a simple}} yet effective technique to isolate bugs. This technique automatically removes or chips away {{parts of a}} program so that the part that contributes to some symptomatic output becomes more apparent to the user. Program chipping is similar in spirit to traditional program slicing and debugging techniques and tools, but chipping uses very simple techniques based on the syntactic structure of the program. We have developed a <b>chipping</b> <b>tool</b> for Java programs, called ChipperJ, and have run it {{on a variety of}} small to large programs, including a Java compiler, looking for various symptoms.

40|$|In {{both the}} {{chemical}} and mechanical pulping process, the logs are cut into wood chips by a disc chipper before fibre separation. To make the wood chipping process more efficient, one have to investigate in detail the coupling between theprocess parameters {{and the quality of}} the chips. The objective of this thesis is to obtain an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms behind the creation of wood chips. Both experimental and analytical/numerical approaches have been taken inthis work. The experimental investigations were performed with an in‐house developed equipment and a digital speckle photography equipment. The results from the experimental investigation showed that the friction between the log and <b>chipping</b> <b>tool</b> is probably one crucal factor for the chip formation. Further more it was found that the indentation process is approximately self‐similar, and that the stress field over the entire crack‐plane is critical for chip creation. The developed analytical model predicts the normal and shear strain distribution. The analytical distributions are in reasonable agreement with the corresponding distributions obtained from a finite element analysis...|$|E
40|$|Face milling {{machinability}} {{investigation of}} two difficult-to-machine nickel-based superalloys, namely Inconel 718 and Waspaloy, {{has been carried}} out with four different types of tungsten carbide tools under various cutting conditions. The tools comprised of one double-layer CVD-TiCN+Al 2 O 3 coated (KC 994 M), two PVD-TiN coated (KC 720 and KC 730) and one uncoated (KMF) tungsten carbide tools. The objectives of the study include investigation of tool performance, failure modes and wear mechanisms under the cutting conditions employed. In addition, surface integrity of the machined surfaces, with regard to surface finish, subsurface microhardness and metallographic examination of the subsurface microstructure, was investigated. CVD-coated KC 994 M gave the best overall performance in terms of tool life at low and high cutting conditions on both workpieces. The second best-performing tool was the uncoated KMF grade which gave as high tool lives as KC 994 M at lower cutting speeds. However at higher cutting speeds, KMF was generally outperformed by PVD-TiN coated tools. Short tool lives were obtained at higher cutting speeds of 75 and 100 m/min due to premature failure by <b>chipping.</b> <b>Tool</b> wear at low cutting speed range was due to a combination of progressive microchipping and plucking through a fracture/attrition related wear mechanism associated with cyclic workpiece adhesion and detachment and abrasion/diffusion-related flank wear. Plucking and microchipping were the dominant wear mechanisms. Coating layers on the rake face of both CVD and PVD coated tools were almost completely removed within the first few seconds of cutting at all cutting speeds tested, thus becoming ineffective. On the flank face, however, they remained intact for a longer period and hence increasing tools performance at the medium cutting speed range. Analysis of the subsurface microstructures and microhardness measurements showed that plastic deformation was the predominant effect induced onto the machined surface, the degree of which influenced by the cutting speed, tool wear and prolonged machining. In addition surface irregularities in the form of tearing and embedded hard particles were found to occur which was mainly associated with the chipping dominated wear mode...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} {{vapour deposition}} of hard coatings on cutting tools is an emerging technology with the capability of generating many different coatings with complex microstructures which {{have the potential for}} exploitation {{in a wide variety of}} applications.

40|$|Grinding can be {{described}} as a multi-tooth metal cutting operation in which material is generally removed by shearing and ploughing in the form of micro sized chips by the abrasive grits of the grinding wheel. As a result, high temperature is produced in the grinding zone due to large negative rake and high cutting speed of the grinding wheel. Suitable cutting fluid is employed to reduce the temperature through cooling and lubrication in the cutting zone. As conventionally applied cutting fluid is unable to enter into the <b>chip</b> <b>tool</b> interface, the interface temperature is reduced to some extent. However, high-pressure coolant (HPC) jet effectively reduces cutting zone temperature entering into <b>chip</b> <b>tool</b> interface maintaining a good surface integrity. The present work investigates the role of high-pressure coolant jet on chip formation, grinding zone temperature and surface roughness in grinding AISI- 1040 steel. The experimental results indicate significant reduction in cutting temperature on application of high-pressure coolant, which enables favorable chip formation and a better surface integrity for the finished work piece...|$|R

40|$|Ceramic {{tools are}} prone to {{chipping}} due to their low impact toughness. <b>Tool</b> <b>chipping</b> significantly decreases the surface finish quality and dimensional accuracy of the workpiece. Thus, in-process detection of <b>chipping</b> in ceramic <b>tools</b> is important especially in unattended machining. Existing in-process tool failure detection methods using sensor signals have limitations in detecting <b>tool</b> <b>chipping.</b> The monitoring of tool wear from the workpiece profile using machine vision has great potential to be applied in-process, however no attempt {{has been made to}} detect <b>tool</b> <b>chipping.</b> In this work, a vision-based approach has been developed to detect <b>tool</b> <b>chipping</b> in ceramic insert from 2 -D workpiece profile signature. The profile of the workpiece surface was captured using a DSLR camera. The surface profile was extracted to sub-pixel accuracy using invariant moment method. The effect of chipping in the ceramic cutting tools on the workpiece profile was investigated using autocorrelation function (ACF) and fast Fourier transform (FFT). Detection of onset <b>tool</b> <b>chipping</b> was conducted by using the sub-window FFT and continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Chipping in the ceramic tool was found to cause the peaks of ACF of the workpiece profile to decrease rapidly as the lag distance increased and deviated significantly from one another at different workpiece rotation angles. From FFT analysis the amplitude of the fundamental feed frequency increases steadily with cutting duration during gradual wear, however, fluctuates significantly after <b>tool</b> has <b>chipped.</b> The stochastic behaviour of the cutting process after <b>tool</b> <b>chipping</b> leads to a sharp increase in the amplitude of spatial frequencies below the fundamental feed frequency. CWT method was found more effective to detect the onset of toolchipping at 16. 5 s instead of 17. 13 s by sub-window FFT. Root mean square of CWT coefficients for the workpiece profile at higher scale band was found to be more xxiv sensitive to chipping and thus can be used as an indicator to detect the occurrence of the <b>tool</b> <b>chipping</b> in ceramic inserts...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{suggestions}} are current concerning {{the rake face}} action of cutting lubricants; that they reduce the shear stress between <b>chip</b> and <b>tool</b> uniformly over the whole chip-tool contact area; that they reduce the con-tact length between chip and tool; and that they induce conditions on the rake face of the tool in which the interfacial shear stress between <b>chip</b> and <b>tool</b> decreases rapidly with distance from {{the cutting edge of}} the tool. The present work describes experiments on the dry and lubricated orthogonal machining of high permeability iron which have enabled it to be decided which of these theories is correct. The workpiece flow pattern in lubricated machining has been recorded with sufficient accuracy to enable the slip-line field for the flow to be calculated. The shear-stress distribution along the plastic part of the chip-tool contact length has been deduced from the angles at which the slip lines meet the rake face. It has been found that even when the workpiece was flooded with carbon tetrachloride, sticking friction occurred between the <b>chip</b> and <b>tool</b> near the cutting edge of the tool, although good lubrication occurred in the region where the <b>chip</b> left the <b>tool.</b> It has therefore been concluded that the lubricant acted to induce a steep interfacial shear-stress gradient along the chip-tool contact length. The cause of the shear-stress gradient along the rake face in lubricated cutting is discussed in terms of the vary-ing conformity between the <b>chip</b> and <b>tool</b> along the chip-tool contact length. Near the cutting edge of the tool, gross plastic deformation of the workpiece caused the chip to flow into intimate contact with the rake face of the tool, denying lubricant a path along the rake face to the cutting edge. A theory of the mechanics of orthogonal cutting is presented which explains how the shear-stress gradient along the chip-tool contact length causes the characteristic features of lubricated machining, namely the forma-tion of thin and, in particular, tightly curled chips with a small area of contact with the tool rake face...|$|R

The power consumed in metal cutting during turning operation was largely converted into heat. Continuous or steady state machining operations like orthogonal cutting are studied by modelling the heat transfer between the <b>tool</b> and <b>chip</b> at the <b>tool</b> rake surface contact zone. The shear energy is created in the primary zone, where the main plastic deformation takes place, second at the <b>chip</b> <b>tool</b> interface zone where secondary plastic deformation takes place due to the friction between the heated <b>chip</b> and the <b>tool</b> takes place and the third zone where heat is generated at the work tool interface i. e., at the flanks where frictional rubbing takes place.

In addition temperature measurement techniques used in metal cutting have been briefly reviewed. This work includes the study oh heat influencing the cutting tool in both uncoated and coated insert. The numerical methodology used here is ANSYS. Finite element method was used to model the effect of coated and uncoated cemented carbide cutting tool. After solving the solution obtained showed that the temperature at the tip(tool-work piece contact area) was maximum and it goes on decreasing towards the surface and it was also observed that the temperature generated for coated tool is little less in comparison to uncoated cemented carbide insert this shows that the tool life can be increased by placing a coating layer of TiN. ...|$|R
