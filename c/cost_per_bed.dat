40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{national}} legislation, {{reforms and}} regulations {{of the nursing}} home sector has shown increased focus on quality of care. The tendencies have also been present in the City of Oslo, where a relatively comprehensive quality measurement system has been implemented. Oslo has three different operating structures {{in the nursing home}} sector; public, private and nonprofit. All nursing homes have been subjects to the same measurement system regardless of operating structure. The measured quality has shown variations across the nursing homes. The City of Oslo has produced cost reports which also show variations. OBJECTIVE: The objective has been {{to find out if the}} variations of costs and quality were reflected in the type of operating structure. The study question has been; do operating structures have an effect on <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>bed</b> and measured quality? METHOD: Results from cost reports, quality measurements and operating structures were arranged into a panel data set for the period 2007 to 2009. Fixed and random effects models were constructed. Different quality results and <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>bed</b> served as dependent variables and operating structure was the independent variable. A Hausman test concluded that the random effects model was consistent and efficient. The main hypothesis was: measured quality and costs per bed are not affected by operating structure. RESULT: Private nursing homes had a significantly lower <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>bed</b> compared to public and nonprofit, controlled for time effects. The significance level was 1 %. Only one quality measurement, relative survey score, showed significant differences among the operating structures. The nonprofit nursing homes had a significantly higher score compared to public and private, this was on the 1 % significance level. CONCLUTION: Results suggested that operating structure might have an effect on costs and parts of the measured quality, solely the relative survey score. It is possible that less pension costs might be the reason for lower costs of private nursing homes. It is also possible that the status and reputation of nonprofit nursing homes results in a higher score among the patients relatives. A closer study of the quality results and cost reports is necessary to make further conclusions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Millions of {{children}} die {{every year in}} developing countries, from preventable diseases such as pneumonia and diarrhoea, owing to low levels of investment in child health. Investment efforts are hampered by {{a general lack of}} adequate information that is necessary for priority setting in this sector. This paper measures the health system costs of providing inpatient and outpatient services, and also the costs associated with treating pneumonia and diarrhoea in under-five children at a health centre in Zambia. Methods Annual economic and financial cost data were collected in 2005 - 2006. Data were summarized in a Microsoft excel spreadsheet to obtain total department costs and average disease treatment costs. Results The total annual cost of operating the health centre was US$ 1, 731, 661 of which US$ 1 284 306 and US$ 447, 355 were patient care and overhead departments costs, respectively. The average cost of providing out-patient services was US$ 3 per visit, while the cost of in-patient treatment was US$ 18 per bed day. The cost of providing dental services was highest at US$ 20 per visit, and the cost of VCT services was lowest, with US$ 1 per visit. The cost per out-patient visit for under-five pneumonia was US$ 48, while the <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>bed</b> day was US$ 215. The cost per outpatient visit attributed to under-five diarrhoea was US$ 26, and the <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>bed</b> day was US$ 78. Conclusion In the face of insufficient data, a cost analysis exercise is a difficult but feasible undertaking. The study findings are useful and applicable in similar settings, and can be used in cost effectiveness analyses of health interventions. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} an {{efficiency}} evaluation of selected hospital bed care providers during years 2010 - 2012 with respect to selected factors: The size of the hospital establishment according to number of beds, number of hospitalized patients, {{the average length of}} stay per a patient in care, total staff <b>cost</b> calculated <b>per</b> <b>bed,</b> total revenues calculated <b>per</b> <b>bed,</b> and total <b>costs</b> calculated <b>per</b> <b>bed.</b> For this purpose, hospitals providing primarily acute bed care were chosen. From the legal point of view, they are allowance organizations of a particular region. The evaluation concerns both allocative efficiency and technical efficiency. The allocative efficiency is treated from the proper algorithm point of view and it compares total <b>costs</b> calculated <b>per</b> <b>bed</b> with total revenues calculated <b>per</b> <b>bed.</b> A method denominated Data Envelopment Analysis was applied for the calculation of the technical efficiency of units. To be more specific, it was input-oriented model with constant returns to scale (CCR). The input parameters involve the number of beds, the average length of stay and <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> day of stay. Output parameters were as follows: Bed occupancy in days and the number of hospitalized patients. The data published by the Institute of Health Information and Statistic of the Czech Republic and by ÚFIS system (the Data Base of Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic) were used as the source of data. The evaluation implies that only three hospitals were economically-effective: Silesian Hospital in Opava, Hospital Jihlava, and TGM Hospital Hodonín.

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} of this field study was to compare effect of stall base on herd health, stall maintenance, bedding cost, and producer satisfaction. Ninety-one dairies visited during a 4 -mo period starting October 14, 2005 included 33 rubber-filled mattress (RFM), 27 sand, and 31 waterbed (WB) stall bases. In this study, percent culled was higher for RFM (P = 0. 001) and sand (P = 0. 06) than WB dairies. Percent of cows in fourth lactation or greater was higher on WB than either RFM (P = 0. 01) or sand (P = 0. 02) dairies. There {{was no difference between}} base types for production or somatic cell count. Bedding <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>bed</b> per week was WB ($ 0. 73), RFM ($ 0. 89), and sand ($ 0. 97). Sand beds were bedded less frequently (P = 0. 01). Comparisons between RFM and sand indicate higher satisfaction for RFM regarding manure management (P < 0. 0001) and higher satisfaction with sand for cow comfort (P < 0. 0001). Producers with WB were more satisfied with base life (P < 0. 0001) and cow comfort (P < 0. 0001) than those with RFM. Producers with WB were more satisfied with cow longevity (P < 0. 0001) as compared to RFM. Length of sand stall was correlated with longevity (0. 56, P = 0. 01) while percent of mature cows was greater on dairies that provided waterbeds (P = 0. 02). This data indicates that WB may be a viable option for cows and producers, when good quality sand is unavailable or handling sand-laden manure is not feasible...|$|E

We apply Linear Regression Analysis method from statistics to identify the significance of major organization variables on hospital cost variations. To explain variations in hospital costs in this study, we focus on the following organizational structure variables: ownership type, financial structure, location, bed size, breadth of services, and teaching status. The results of our regression model show that increasing breadth of services, hospitals located in rural regions, and not-for-profit organizations are all expected to experience higher hospital <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> <b>bed</b> than their counterparts.

40|$|Aim: Cancer {{remains a}} major health problem in all {{communities}} worldwide. Rising healthcare {{costs associated with}} treating advanced cancers present a significant economic challenge. It is a need of the hour that the health sector should devise cost-effective measures {{to be put in}} place for better affordability of treatments. To achieve this objective, information generation through indigenous hospital data on unit cost of in-patient cancer chemotherapy in medical oncology became imperative and thus hallmark of this study. Design and Setting: The present prospective hospital based study was conducted in Medical Oncology Department of tertiary care teaching hospital. Materials and Methods: After permission from the Ethical Committee, a prospective study of 6 months duration was carried out to study the cost of treatment provided to in-patients in Medical Oncology. Direct costs that include the cost of material, labor and laboratory investigations, along with indirect costs were calculated, and data analyzed to compute unit cost of treatment. Results: The major cost components of in-patient cancer chemotherapy are cost of drugs and materials as 46. 88 % and labor as 48. 45 %. The average unit <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> patient <b>per</b> <b>bed</b> day for in-patient chemotherapy is Rs. 5725. 12 ($ 125. 96). This includes expenditure incurred both by the hospital and the patient (out of pocket). Conclusion: The economic burden of cancer treatment is quite high both for the patient and the healthcare provider.

Canopy development was faster and canopy closure was greater in the double seed line than in the single seed line systems and was greater in the 32 inch than in the 40 inch row systems. At Maricopa, the single line 32 inch system yield of 1571 lbs. /A was significantly greater than the yields of the other seed line/row spacing systems. The yields of the single line 40 and the double line 32 inch systems {{were not significantly different}} at 1476 and 1411 lbs. of lint/A, respectively, and the yields of the double line 32 and the double line 40 inch systems also were not significantly different at 1411 and 1396 lbs. of lint/A, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background Obesity is {{the cause}} of other chronic diseases, {{psychological}} problems, obesity shortens the lifespan and puts strain on health systems. The risk associated with childhood obesity in particular, which will accelerate the development of adult morbidity and mortality, has been identified as an emerging public health problem. Methods To estimate the length of stay and associated hospital costs for obesity related illnesses a cost of illness study was set up. All discharges from all acute hospitals in the Republic of Ireland from 1997 to 2004 with a principal or secondary diagnostic code for obesity for all children from 6 to 18 years of age and for adults were collected. A discharge frequency was calculated by dividing obesity related discharges {{by the total number of}} diagnoses (principal and secondary) for each year. The hospital costs related to obesity was calculated based on the total number of days care. Results The discharge frequency of obesity related conditions increased from 1. 14 in 1997 to 1. 49 in 2004 for adults and from 0. 81 to 1. 37 for children. The relative length of stay (number of days in care for obesity related conditions per 1000 days of hospital care given) increased from 1. 47 in 1997 to 4. 16 in 2004 for children and from 3. 68 in 1997 to 6. 74 in 2004 for adults. Based on the 2001 figures for <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> inpatient <b>bed</b> day, the annual hospital cost was calculated to be 4. 4 Euromillion in 1997, increasing to 13. 3 Euromillion in 2004. At a 20 % variable hospital cost the cost ranges from 0. 9 Euromillion in 1997 to 2. 7 Euromillion in 2004; a 200 % increase. Conclusion The annual increase in the proportion of hospital discharges related to obesity is alarming. This increase is related to a significant increase in economic costs. This paper emphasises the need for action at an early stage of life. Health promotion and primary prevention of obesity should be high on the political agenda. </p...|$|R
