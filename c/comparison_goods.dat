The primary catchment area for the town centre (the area for which the centre attracts the largest single flow of generated expenditure) for non-bulky <b>comparison</b> <b>goods</b> extends as far as Goring-on-Thames, Henley-on-Thames, Pangbourne and Wokingham. The secondary catchment area (the area where the centre attracts 10% or more of generated expenditure) also includes Ascot, Bracknell, Sandhurst, Camberley, Didcot, Farnborough, Fleet, High Wycombe, Maidenhead, Newbury, Slough, Tadley, Thatcham, Wallingford and Windsor.

50|$|The {{city centre}} {{currently}} features 89650 m2 of <b>comparison</b> <b>goods</b> floorspace (clothing, furniture, electrical goods etc.) and 22950 m2 of convenience goods floorspace (food and groceries). According {{to an analysis}} cited in the City Centre Strategic Framework, Swansea is the eighteenth largest retail centre in the UK, relatively large for its population. However, the general quality, range and size of city centre shops is poor, so Swansea is usually ranked outside the top 50 retail centres in the UK on various industry listings. The poor retail performance {{is believed to be}} the result of several factors, including poor urban design, lack of recent development and competition from out-of-town shops at Fforestfach and Morfa.|$|E
50|$|Elm Park is {{identified}} as a district centre in the London Plan and a priority for regeneration. Within Havering it is near to the major centre at Hornchurch and metropolitan centre at Romford. The compact retail area extends along the whole of The Broadway, which is flanked by the Station Parade and Tadworth Parade precincts, and continues along parts of Elm Park Avenue and Saint Nicholas Avenue. There are 196 units in the town centre. As of November 2012, 13.91% are convenience goods, 30.43% <b>comparison</b> <b>goods,</b> 42.61% services, and 13.04% vacant. These include a variety of independent and high street brand shops, including banks, clothes shops, pharmacies, bakers, greengrocers, fishmongers, florists, opticians, bicycle shops, butchers, hairdressers, grocery stores, off licence, dry cleaners, travel agents, and a post office. The unit sizes are fairly small, with a Tesco Express and The Co-operative Food forming {{some of the larger}} stores. In 2013 an M local branded Morrisons convenience store opened and a Sainsbury's replaced the former Elm Park Hotel. There is a library which has recently been rebuilt. There is a number of takeaways, cafes and restaurants.|$|E

40|$|Neo-traditional {{developments}} are often comprised of mix-use neighborhoods with a town center {{that acts as}} the central commercial district that is easily accessible to the surrounding residents without a car. This paper investigates the reality of walking and biking in two such neo-traditional developments in Colorado. I compared frequency and purpose of non-car trips in two neighborhoods whose local town centers differ in retail composition. The first town center, Belmar, has a higher composition of <b>comparison</b> <b>goods</b> and services such as clothing, apparel, and other <b>comparison</b> <b>goods.</b> The second, East 29 th Avenue Town Center, has a higher composition of convenient goods and services such as the library, dry cleaners, and dog wash store. An analysis of travel behavior surveys from fifty residents of each site reveals {{no significant difference in}} the travel behavior between residents of the two neighborhoods. While having a higher percentage of convenience goods was not shown to increase the residents’ perception of driving less, my evidence suggests that only specific convenience goods, such as grocery stores and dry cleaners, increases the residents’ perception of making less car trips. While the absence of significant findings may have resulted from a small sample size, and the absence of travel diaries, this research can serve as an exploratory study for further research on the relationship between retail composition and travel behavior...|$|E

40|$|The term «benchmarking» was {{put into}} {{scientific}} circulation in 1972 {{to refer to a}} permanent, continuous process of <b>comparison</b> <b>goods</b> (works, services), production processes, methods and other parameters of the business (business unit) with similar facilities to other businesses or branch (standards). Later this term began to denote a method of acquiring a competitive advantage and improve the competitiveness of a business entity by searching, learning and adapting to its own terms of best practice implementation of business processes regardless of their scope. It is the scope of economic activity, the term «benchmarking» was in the management science, where it was used as a metaphor of the standard to which we should strive. Benchmarking has been considered as part of the decision-making process with clear natsilennistyu to improve the organization. It is a systematic process to assess alternatives, implementing strategies and improving business performance by studying successful strategies of external partner organizations. In the socio-political context, benchmarking is used at three levels: {{at the level of the}} organization and is used to improve the internal environment and acts primarily as an internal control; at the sector (sectoral) level focuses on the problems of competition, which the organization is exposed within it, and involvement in the work of partners from other sectors (industries); at Community level the purpose of benchmarking is to improve the environment in which the organization operates. Implementation of policy coordination involves broad participation zatsykavlenyh people in political decision-making, coordination of different levels of management, use of information, indicators and benchmarking, development initiatives «bottom-up», recognizing the need to diversify approaches, lack of punishment, and voluntary participation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{patterns of}} usage {{and modes of}} access to traditional shopping districts. Environmentalists and designers have advocated a return to “traditional neighborhood development,” with higher densities, mixed uses, pedestrian amenities and transit service, to reduce auto dependence for shopping and other trips. Critics have countered that proximity only partly explains shopping destination and mode choice, but draw their evidence mostly from auto-dominated shopping centers, not traditional ones. Whether shopping districts predominantly serve local residents and support trip reduction has remained to be examined. This dissertation examines customer characteristics, patterns of use, and modes of access in six traditional shopping areas in the Oakland-Berkeley, California, area. The six districts are surrounded by middle class, moderately dense residential neighborhoods with transit service and pedestrian access consonant with neo-traditional design. They vary in scale and mix of uses across the range proposed by neo-traditional designers. Surveys, counts, and observations reveal that all six shopping areas draw a mix of residents and non-residents. The non-residents’ share increases with {{the scale of the}} shopping area and the share of comparison shopping. Distance is {{the most important factor in}} the mode choice to these shopping areas; most non-residents drive, whereas only half the residents do. Younger customers and those with few or no autos walk more than average. Those shopping for groceries or making multiple stops for specialty food typically drive. Non-resident shoppers are more likely to purchase <b>comparison</b> <b>goods</b> than residents. Both groups are attracted by specialty foods. Trip generation rates in the six shopping areas are higher than conventional methods predict, but auto shares are much lower. The result is parking demand close to conventional estimates. The dissertation reveals conflicts among the needs of residents, the needs of shopping districts, and traffic mitigation objectives. Many uses that serve residents and add interest and vitality to traditional shopping areas also attract a high share of non-residents, mostly by car. Trip generation can be very high, even though the auto share is relatively low. If other neo-traditional shopping districts follow suit, their benefits will stem more convenience than from trip reduction per se...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} oxygen mass {{transfer}} in a turbulent air-water stirred tank is investigated. A multivariate population balance model is {{coupled with the}} Eulerian multi-fluid approach to describe the spatial and temporal evolution of the bubble size and composition distributions. For the numerical solution of the population balance model the conditional quadrature method of moments is employed and implemented through user-defined scalars and functions in the computational fluid dynamics code ANSYS/Fluent 12. The approach is validated by comparing model predictions with experiments (from the literature) conducted in an air-water stirred tank equipped with a Rushton turbine and a porous sparger. First predictions are compared with the experimentally measured mean Sauter diameter. The comparison highlights that the modelling approach is capable of predicting the main feature of the system.
