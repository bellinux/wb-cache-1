The shapes of ornamental vases included inverted trumpets, elongated cylinders and exaggerated bottle forms, although tableware shapes were conventional. Early Successionist patterns featured realistic renderings of natural motifs—flowers, birds and human figures—but under the combined influence of Solon and Wadsworth, these became increasingly exaggerated and stylised, with the characteristic convoluted plant forms and floral motifs reaching {{a peak of}} extravagance {{around the turn of}} the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{regional}} dishes in Switzerland. One example is Zürcher Geschnetzeltes, thin strips of veal with mushrooms in a cream sauce served with Rösti.

Swiss cheeses, in particular Emmental cheese, Gruyère, Vacherin, and Appenzeller, are famous Swiss products. The most popular <b>cheese</b> <b>dishes</b> are fondue and raclette. Both these dishes were originally regional dishes, but were popularized by the Swiss Cheese Union to boost sales of cheese.|$|R
50|$|Mass-produced rennet {{began in}} the 1860s. By {{the turn of the}} century, {{scientists}} were producing pure microbial cultures. Previously, bacteria in cheese was derived from the environment or from recycling an earlier batch's whey. Pure cultures meant a standardized cheese could be produced. The mass production of cheese made it readily available to the poorer classes. Therefore, simple cost-effective storage solutions for cheese gained popularity. Ceramic <b>cheese</b> <b>dishes,</b> or <b>cheese</b> bells, {{became one of the most}} common ways to prolong the life of cheese in the home. It remained popular in most households until the introduction of the home refrigerator in 1913.|$|R

5000|$|Some cheeses, like raclette, melt smoothly; many tend {{to become}} stringy or suffer from a {{separation}} of their fats. Many of these can be coaxed into melting smoothly {{in the presence of}} acids or starch. Fondue, with wine providing the acidity, {{is a good example of}} a smoothly melted <b>cheese</b> <b>dish.</b> Elastic stringiness is a quality that is sometimes enjoyed, in dishes including pizza and Welsh rarebit. Even a melted cheese eventually turns solid again, after enough moisture is cooked off. The saying [...] "you can't melt cheese twice" [...] (meaning [...] "some things can only be done once") refers to the fact that oils leach out during the first melting and are gone, leaving the non-meltable solids behind.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of press {{coverage}} of the siege of the tower, Malakhov Kurgan became a household name in Europe and many large and expensive towers in Western Europe were named after it. Among these {{were a number of}} stone mining towers in the Ruhrgebiet, the so-called caponier Fort Malakoff in Mainz, and the yellow sandstone Malakoff Tower in the city of Luxembourg. In addition, the Malakoff cake was named after Duke of Malakoff, as was a <b>cheese</b> <b>dish</b> in parts of Switzerland. In France, the battle was officially commemorated in a rare way: apart from the Battle of Magenta (in the Italian Campaign), it {{was the only one of}} Emperor Napoleon III's exploits to result in the awarding of a victory title (both of ducal rank); this distinction was bestowed upon Marshal Pélissier. A suburb of Paris was also named after this battle, as well as the Avenue de Malakoff. Malakhov Kurgan, where it was fought, now contains the Eternal Fire, commemorating the Siege of Sevastopol during World War II. A branch of Franz Roubaud's great panorama representing the battle of 1855 is also located there.|$|E

5000|$|Susan Mayer {{is trying}} to jog Mike’s memory. In his room, she is playing [...] "their" [...] song, [...] "Car Wash," [...] which they danced to some time ago. Mike doesn’t {{remember}} at all. The next day, Susan brings her infamous macaroni and <b>cheese</b> <b>dish</b> to the hospital. The usual nurse, Marcie, is vacationing in Honolulu, Hawaii. When Edie comes into the hospital, Nurse Parker, Marcie’s replacement, tells her that Edie has been visiting Mike every single day since he woke up. Edie has been passing herself off as Mike’s girlfriend. When Susan and Edie both tell Nurse Parker that they’re the real girlfriend of Mike, she sides with Edie, and orders security to take Susan out of the building. Marcie is the only nurse that knows the truth about Susan and Mike’s relationship. The next day, Susan tricks the nurse to tell Edie she has a phone call. While Edie is on the phone, (when no one is there) Susan takes Mike out of the hospital, and back to Wisteria Lane. She tells him about accidentally locking herself outside naked, their first kiss in his pick-up truck, and meeting each other at Mary Alice’s wake, but Mike remembers none of these stories. When Susan trips on the curb, Mike remembers her being a klutz. Susan is very happy, that is, until the hospital security guard finds them. Susan and Edie both try to convince each other that Mike {{will end up with}} them.|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} 1900 s, the Dream of the Rarebit Fiend comic strip {{conveyed}} how the spicy <b>cheese</b> <b>dish</b> Welsh rarebit leads to bizarre and disturbing dreams. Today, {{the perception that}} foods disturb dreaming persists. But apart from case studies, some exploratory surveys, and a few lab studies on how hunger affects dreaming, there is little empirical evidence addressing this topic. The present study examines 3 aspects of the food/dreaming relationship; it attempts to: 1) assess the prevalence of the perception of food-dependent dreaming {{and the types of}} foods most commonly blamed; 2) determine if perceived food-dependent dreaming is associated with dietary, sleep or motivational factors; and 3) explore whether these factors, independent of food/dreaming perceptions, are associated with reports of vivid and disturbing dreaming. 396 students completed questionnaires evaluating sleep, dreams, and dietary habits and motivations. Items queried whether they had noticed if foods produced bizarre or disturbing dreams and if eating late at night influenced their dreams. The perception of food-dependent dreaming had a prevalence of 17. 8 %; dairy products were the most frequently blamed food type (39 %- 44 %). Those who perceived food-dependent dreaming differed from others by reporting more frequent and disturbing dreams, poorer sleep, higher coffee intake, and lower Intuitive Eating Scale scores. Reports of disturbing dreams were associated with a pathological constellation of measures that include poorer sleep, binge-eating, and eating for emotional reasons. Reports of vivid dreams were associated with measures indicative of wellness: better sleep, a healthier diet, and longer times between meals (fasting). Results clarify the relationship between food and dreaming and suggest 4 explanations for the perception of food-dependent dreaming: 1) food specific effects; 2) food-induced distress; 3) folklore influences, and 4) causal misattributions. Clinical implications are discussed...|$|E

25|$|Jacob ben Asher {{thought that}} washing the mouth was not {{sufficient}} to remove all residue of cheese, and suggested that eating some additional solid food is required to clean the mouth. Hard and aged cheese has long been rabbinically considered to need extra precaution, {{on the basis that}} it might have a much stronger and longer lasting taste; the risk of it leaving a fattier residue has more recently been raised as a concern. According to these rabbinic opinions, the same precautions (including a pause of up to six hours) apply to eating hard cheese before meat as apply to eating meat in a meal when the meat is eaten first. Judah ben Simeon, a 17th-century doctor in Frankfurt, argued that hard cheese is not problematic if melted. Binyomin Forst argues that leniency is proper only for cooked <b>cheese</b> <b>dishes</b> and not <b>dishes</b> topped with <b>cheese.</b>|$|R
50|$|Several {{preparation}} methods exist. Some recipes incorporate {{all of the}} ingredients together, while others are prepared with the ingredients separately layered. Those that use cheese may use grated <b>cheese</b> atop the <b>dish,</b> while others mix the <b>cheese</b> throughout the <b>dish.</b> Sometimes, onions or beans are added. Basic versions may be prepared using chopped meat, tomato, spices, and elbow macaroni. Another basic preparation method incorporates boxed, prepared macaroni and cheese and canned chili. The dish may be prepared on a range top in a skillet, in a slow cooker or baked as a casserole.|$|R
5000|$|Pasta {{other than}} {{macaroni}} noodles are often used: most any short-cut extruded pasta {{and many of}} the decorative cut pasta will do, particularly those with folds and pockets to hold the <b>cheese.</b> The <b>dish</b> may still be referred to as [...] "macaroni and cheese" [...] when made with a different pasta; while [...] "shells and cheese" [...] is sometimes used when it is made with Conchiglie.|$|R
