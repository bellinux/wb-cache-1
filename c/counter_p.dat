40|$|ABSTRACT The {{opportunistic}} pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can infect {{almost any}} {{site in the}} body but most often targets epithelial cell-lined tissues such as the airways, skin, and the cornea of the eye. A common predisposing factor is cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane-conductance regulator (CFTR). Previously, we showed that when P. aeruginosa enters epithelial cells it replicates intracellularly and occupies plasma membrane blebs. This phenotype is depen-dent on the type 3 secretion system (T 3 SS) effector ExoS, shown by others to induce host cell apoptosis. Here, we examined mechanisms for P. aeruginosa-induced bleb formation, focusing on its relationship to apoptosis and the CFTR. The data showed that P. aeruginosa-induced blebbing in epithelial cells is independent of actin contraction and is inhibited by hyperosmotic me-dia (400 to 600 mOsM), distinguishing bacterially induced blebs from apoptotic blebs. Cells with defective CFTR displayed en-hanced bleb formation upon infection, as demonstrated using bronchial epithelial cells from a patient with cystic fibrosis and a CFTR inhibitor, CFTR(Inh) - 172. The defect {{was found to be}} correctable either by incubation in hyperosmotic media or by com-plementation with CFTR (pGFP-CFTR), suggesting that the osmoregulatory function of CFTR <b>counters</b> <b>P.</b> aeruginosa-induced bleb-niche formation. Accordingly, and despite their reduced capacity for bacterial internalization, CFTR-deficient cells showed greater bacterial occupation of blebs and enhanced intracellular replication. Together, these data suggest that P. aeruginosa bleb niches are distinct from apoptotic blebs, are driven by osmotic forces countered by CFTR, and could provide a novel mechanis...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePseudomonas aeruginosa is an {{important}} opportunistic human pathogen that can establish bacterial communication by synchronizing the behavior of individual cells in a molecular phenomenon known as "quorum sensing". Through an elusive mechanism involving gene products of the pqs operon, the PqsE enzyme is absolutely required for the synthesis of extracellular phenazines, including the toxic blue pigment pyocyanin, effectively allowing cells to achieve full-fledged virulence. Despite several functional and structural attempts at deciphering the role of this relevant enzymatic drug target, no molecular function has yet been ascribed to PqsE. In the present study, we report a series of alanine scanning experiments aimed at altering the biological function of PqsE, allowing us to uncover key amino acid positions involved in the molecular function of this enzyme. We use sequence analysis and structural overlays with members of homologous folds to pinpoint critical positions located {{in the vicinity of}} the ligand binding cleft and surrounding environment, revealing the importance of a unique C-terminal α-helical motif in the molecular function of PqsE. Our results suggest that the active site of the enzyme involves residues that extend further into the hydrophobic core of the protein, advocating for a lid-like movement of the two terminal helices. This information should help design virtual libraries of PqsE inhibitors, providing means to <b>counter</b> <b>P.</b> aeruginosa virulence acquisition and helping to reduce nosocomial infections...|$|E

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections of {{wounds in}} {{clinical}} settings are major complications whose outcomes {{are influenced by}} host responses that are not completely understood. Herein we evaluated transcriptomic changes of wounds as they <b>counter</b> <b>P.</b> aeruginosa infection-first active infection, and then chronic biofilm infection. We used the dermal full-thickness, rabbit ear excisional wound model. We studied the wound response: towards acute infection at 2, 6, and 24 hrs after inoculating 106 bacteria into day- 3 wounds; and, towards more chronic biofilm infection of wounds similarly infected for 24 hrs but then treated with topical antibiotic to coerce biofilm growth and evaluated at day 5 and 9 post-infection. The wounds were analyzed for bacterial counts, expression of P. aeruginosa virulence and biofilm-synthesis genes, biofilm morphology, infiltrating immune cells, re-epithelialization, and genome-wide gene expression (RNA-Seq transcriptome). This analysis revealed that 2 hrs after bacterial inoculation into day- 3 wounds, the down-regulated genes (infected vs. non-infected) of the wound edge were nearly all non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), comprised of snoRNA, miRNA, and RNU 6 pseudogenes, and their down-regulation preceded a general down-regulation of skin-enriched coding gene expression. As the active infection intensified, ncRNAs remained overrepresented among down-regulated genes; however, at 6 and 24 hrs they changed to a different set, which overlapped between these times, and excluded RNU 6 pseudogenes but included snRNA components of the major and minor spliceosomes. Additionally, the raw counts of multiple types of differentially-expressed ncRNAs increased on post-wounding day 3 in control wounds, but infection suppressed this increase. After 5 and 9 days, these ncRNA counts in control wounds decreased, whereas they increased in the infected, healing-impaired wounds. These data suggest a sequential and coordinated change in the levels of transcripts of multiple major classes of ncRNAs in wound cells transitioning from inflammation to the proliferation phase of healing...|$|E

Biparatopic MAb was prepared by using cross-linking of reduced Fab' fragments from PR 1 A 3 and T 84. 66. Fifty-nine tumors from 2 human colorectal carcinoma cell lines with high (KM- 12 c) and low (Clone A) carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) expression were successfully implanted subcutaneously on the backs of 42 nude mice. Tumors were localized using 125 I-labeled MAbs: IgG, F(ab') (2) and Fab' of PR 1 A 3, and biparatopic MAb of PR 1 A 3 and T 84. 66. Radioactivity counted on a portable radioisotope detector correlated well with that counted on a gamma <b>counter</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 001). Accumulations of radioactivity in control mice without tumorigenesis were the greatest in PR 1 A 3 IgG-pretreated mice and the least in biparatopic MAb-pretreated mice. Tumors of 2 cell lines did not differ in the distribution of radiolabeled MAbs. Localization indices of the tumor in various organs revealed 1. 3 to 4. 1 in PR 1 A 3 IgG-pretreated mice, 2. 4 to 6. 6 in fragment MAbs of PR 1 A 3 -pretreated mice and 2 to 4. 6 in biparatopic MAb-pretreated mice.

Here we present further results obtained with protons of 1. 5 GeV at the SIS. All counters have center anodes with strips read out {{at both ends}} and altogether six 1 mm thick plates and four gaps of 0. 3 mm. Both outermost plates {{are connected to the}} HV; the inner electrodes are floating. Further details are given in Table 1. As electronics we used fast GSI amplifiers [3] and different types of discriminators. Fig. 1 shows various quantitites measured with prototype P I as function of the HV. The position dependence along <b>counter</b> <b>P</b> II is shown in Fig. 2. Parts a) and b) show resolution and mean time at the measured 7 positions. The resolutions lie within 15 ps, however the mean value shows varations of about 100 ps with irregularities in certain regions. These are presumably due to nonuniform gaps (bent/deformed plates). This should be avoided by a better mechanical structure which we have used already in P III. In principle such dependences can be corrected: Part c gives the integrated time spectrum after linearizing the gross dependence with aresolutionof 77 ps. With an incident-particle angle of 55 ◦, a realistic value for a possible setting in FOPI, the resolution in P III improved to 65 ps (from 80 ps at normal incidence); the efficiency increased by 2 %.

40|$|The {{adenovirus}} type 5 mutant dl 1520 was engineered previously to {{be completely}} defective for E 1 B- 55 K functions. Recently, this mutant (also known as ONYX- 015) has been suggested to replicate preferentially in p 53 − and some p 53 + tumor cell lines but to be attenuated in primary cultured cells (C. Heise, A. Sampson-Johannes, A. Williams, F. McCormick, D. D. F. Hoff, and D. H. Kirn, Nat. Med. 3 : 639 – 645, 1997). It {{has been suggested that}} dl 1520 might be used as a “magic bullet” that could selectively lyse tumor cells without harm to normal tissues. However, we report here that dl 1520 replication is independent of p 53 genotype and occurs efficiently in some primary cultured human cells, indicating that the mutant virus does not possess a tumor selectivity. Although it was not the sole host range determinant, p 53 function did reduce dl 1520 replication when analyzed in a cell line expressing temperature-sensitive p 53 (H 1299 -tsp 53) (K. L. Fries, W. E. Miller, and N. Raab-Traub, J. Virol. 70 : 8653 – 8659, 1996). As found earlier for other E 1 B- 55 K mutants in HeLa cells (Y. Ho, R. Galos, and J. Williams, Virology 122 : 109 – 124, 1982), dl 1520 replication was temperature dependent in H 1299 cells. When p 53 function was restored at low temperature in H 1299 -tsp 53 cells, it imposed a modest defect in viral DNA replication and accumulation of late viral cytoplasmic mRNA. However, in both H 1299 and H 1299 -tsp 53 cells, the defect in late viral protein synthesis appeared to be much greater than could be accounted for by the modest defects in late viral mRNA levels. We therefore propose that in addition to <b>countering</b> <b>p</b> 53 function and modulating viral and cellular mRNA nuclear transport, E 1 B- 55 K also stimulates late viral mRNA translation...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{periodontitis}} {{is strongly}} associated with composition of the oral biofilm occupying the gingival crevicular aspect of the tooth and its associated root. Some gram-negative, 2 ̆ 2 red complex 2 ̆ 2 bacteria instigate periodontal bone loss in patients, principal among these Porphyromonas gingivalis. P. gingivalis is a 2 ̆ 2 late colonizer 2 ̆ 2, indicating not only its physical location within the oral biofilm, but also the pathogenic dynamic {{of the interaction between}} P. gingivalis and the host innate immunity. Among several other subversive tactics, P. gingivalis has been shown to compel receptors vital to the orchestration of an appropriate immune response to co-associate and consequently signal in a way that directly benefits the pathogen. Upon interaction with human monocytes and murine macrophages, P. gingivalis has been shown to induce TLR 2 and CXCR 4 to co- associate in lipid rafts via its surface fimbriae. The ensuing crosstalk results in a cAMP dependent, PKA mediated inhibition of NF-KB which in turn leads to a state of mixed signals. TLR 2 attempts to upregulate NF-KB as CXCR 4 simultaneously signals to inhibit TLR 2 antimicrobial signaling. Functionally, this was shown in human monocytes and mouse macrophages to cause downregulation of TNF-a and upregulation of IL- 10. Here we show the interaction between P. gingivalis fimbriae and CXCR 4 to have physiological relevance to the initiation and maintenance of periodontal bone resorption in a mouse model of infection. Pharmacologic inhibition of the P. gingivalis fimbriaeCXCR 4 interaction prevented bone loss as well as halted progression of periodontal disease instigated prior to treatment in the Baker Model of oral infection. We also found that systemic administration of the bicyclam CXCR 4 inhibitor AMD 3100 leads to enhanced killing of P. gingivalis in a subcutaneous chamber model of infection. The subcutaneous chamber is an in vivo model system of the microaerophilic environment of the gingival pocket as well as the influx of dominantly comprised of neutrophils into the gingival crevice characteristic of chronic periodontitis. It is interesting that we noted that CXCR 4 deficient mice display a similar host inflammatory profile to wild-type mice treated with AMD 3100. However, while most of these mice were protected from P. gingivalis-mediated bone loss, one of the CXCR 4 deficient mice did not demonstrate protection from alveolar bone loss when chronically infected with P. gingivalis. These mice also showed a healthier inflammatory profile compared to their infected, untreated counterparts. Thus, the results below indicate that AMD 3100 effectively inhibits periodontal bone loss due to the ability of the compound to <b>counter</b> <b>P.</b> gingivalis 2 ̆ 7 VI recognition of CXCR 4. This provides evidence supporting the importance of this coreceptor in developing therapeutic strategies for treating periodontal disease...|$|E
40|$|On Belgian farms, visible {{fungal growth}} is {{regularly}} encountered in ensiled feed commodities. The toxigenic fungal species Penicillium roqueforti sensu strictu (s. s.) and P. paneum, designated together as P. roqueforti sensu lato (s. l.) in this dissertation, {{are the most}} frequently isolated fungi in silages. Since the inhalation of fungal spores {{as well as the}} consumption of mycotoxin contaminated feed comprise serious health risks, it is of the outmost importance to prevent fungal contamination of silages. In this dissertation, general preventory measures are described. The final goal of this PhD research was to contribute to the prevention of specifically P. roqueforti s. l. development in silage. To achieve this goal, multiple in vitro lab experiments and in vivo trials with microsilos have been conducted, evaluating the effect of several abiotic and biotic factors on P. roqueforti s. l. growth and mycotoxin production. Roquefortine C, a mycotoxin that can be produced by both P. roqueforti s. s. and P. paneum, is considered to be an indicator of mycotoxin production by P. roqueforti s. l. in silages. Therefore, this particular mycotoxin has been determined to evaluate mycotoxin production. During the ensiling process, lactic acid bacteria convert sugars to mainly lactic acid, but also some acetic acid, methanol, ethanol, etc. These compounds can be used by P. roqueforti s. l. as a carbon source. Lactic acid as sole carbon source was not very conducive for fungal growth, while acetic acid (inhibiting aerobic deterioration and subsequent fungal development in silages) as sole carbon source facilitated good fungal growth. This illustrates that P. roqueforti s. l. is very well adapted to its silage-habitat, rendering prevention difficult. The bacterium Bacillus velezensis displayed antagonistic properties towards P. roqueforti s. l. in an in vitro experiment: both culture supernatant as cell suspension reduced spore germination and spore survival and inhibited fungal growth, without triggering an increased roquefortine C production. These observations seemed promising towards the capability of B. velezensis to prevent P. roqueforti s. l. development in silages, but the applied cell suspension could not live up to the great expectations regarding antagonism in an in vivo microsilo trial. Future research is required to investigate the potential of B. velezensis as a silage additive to <b>counter</b> <b>P.</b> roqueforti s. l. in silage. Oxygen appears to {{play a crucial role in}} the development of P. roqueforti s. l. : in anaerobic conditions, no fungal growth can occur. An in vivo microsilo trial with artificially infected whole-crop maize (@ 1500 conidia per gram fresh matter) desiled after 50, 100 or 150 days demonstrated that at desiling after 50 days some P. roqueforti s. l. propagules (66 per gram verse stof) had survived, while after an ensiled period of 100 days no active P. roqueforti s. l. propagules were detected. This experiment emphasizes the importance of a sufficiently long ensiled period, during which the integrity of the silo coverage needs to be maintained. In order to prevent the development of P. roqueforti s. l. in silages, the strict application of good agricultural practices regarding ensiling and desiling, limiting air ingress into silages, is the key factor to success...|$|E
40|$|Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is {{the most}} common life-limiting single gene {{disorder}} in Caucasian populations. CF results from mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which leads to accumulation of thick and sticky mucus in the airways of people with CF, ultimately dampening immune clearance of potential respiratory pathogens. In fact, chronic airway infection by the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in individuals with CF. The ability of P. aeruginosa to chronically infect the airways of people with CF stems, in part at least, from its remarkable capacity to grow as complex multi-cellular communities called biofilms, which offer protection from host immune responses and eradication by conventional antibiotics. Biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa is co-ordinated by a cell density-dependent signalling system called quorum sensing (QS). While P. aeruginosa has multiple QS systems, the major system involves the diffusible signallingmolecule N- 3 -oxo-dodecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C 12 HSL). C 12 HSL not only acts an important biofilm signalling molecule but also regulates bacterial virulence factor production. In addition, C 12 HSL has gene modulatory and cytotoxic effects in host cells. Collectively, these properties have stimulated much research interest in developing novel antimicrobial therapies that specifically target QS. The present study investigated the potential of using the human enzyme, Paraoxonase- 2 (PON 2), to target and inhibit biofilm formation by, and virulence of, P. aeruginosa. Human PON 2 is usually produced intracellularly and has previously been demonstrated to have highly specific hydrolytic activity towards C 12 HSL, and thereby seems to represent an innate mechanism by which host cells might attempt to <b>counter</b> <b>P.</b> aeruginosa QS, and hence infection by this organism. Here, it was hypothesized that the virulence of, and biofilm-formation by, P. aeruginosa could be diminished by manipulating human PON 2 (hPON 2) levels, either by augmenting native PON 2 expression, or by supplementing lactonase activity using a recombinant form of human PON 2 (rhPON 2) exogenously. Thus, the aim of {{the first part of this}} thesis was to determine the gene modulatory and cytotoxic effects of C 12 HSL on airway epithelia, and investigate the regulation of PON 2 expression in mammalian cells. The second part of this thesis was aimed at producing rhPON 2 and investigating whether exogenously supplied rhPON 2 could disrupt P. aeruginosa QS, and thereby increase its susceptibility to the clinically relevant antibiotic tobramycin. C 12 HSL was found to alter gene expression in cultured airway epithelial cells, even at low concentrations. This included the down-regulation of genes involved in immune signalling and the unfolded protein response. C 12 HSL also induced apoptosis and affected epithelial cell viability and metabolic activity in a concentration dependent manner. The results also show that while C 12 HSL itself did not significantly alter the expression of native PON 2 in airway epithelial cells, PON 2 gene expression and PON 2 protein levels rapidly increased in response to agonism of the major mammalian C 12 HSL receptor PPARγ; in turn, these results would seem to link the regulation of human PON 2 to a known major regulator of the inflammatory response. Recombinant hPON 2 was able to hydrolyse almost all detectable C 12 HSL produced in P. aeruginosa cultures with no effect on bacterial growth. Treatment of P. aeruginosa cultures with rhPON 2 tended to decrease expression of all three P. aeruginosa QS systems and associated virulence genes. Importantly, rhPON 2 -dependent hydrolysis of C 12 HSL during bacterial growth, significantly increased the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa cells to the bactericidal effects of the antibiotic tobramycin. In contrast, treatment of P. aeruginosa with rhPON 2 combined with a high concentration of tobramycin, whilst hydrolysing the C 12 HSL and increasing bacterial killing by over an order of magnitude, significantly up-regulated the expression levels of a number of important QS and QS-dependent virulence genes of P. aeruginosa including, lasI, lasB and algD. One interpretation of this result is that bacterial cells treated with this combination up-regulate lasI, the gene that catalyses C 12 HSL synthesis, and other virulence encoding genes, presumably due to antibiotic-induced stress, via a C 12 HSL-independent mechanism. Taken together, the results of this thesis demonstrate that low-level C 12 HSL can influence gene expression in human airway cells, and reveal for the first time that native human PON 2 expression is regulated via a major mammalian C 12 HSL receptor. In addition, rhPON 2 -treatment of P. aeruginosa leads to reduction of C 12 HSL levels and the reduction of bacterial virulence gene expression. The efficacy of rhPON 2 in conjunction with antibiotics however, requires further investigation, using lower-concentrations (clinically achievable levels) of antibiotic and antibiotics with alternative mechanisms of action. The results of this thesis strongly support rhON 2 being a novel and useful anti-Pseudomonal therapy...|$|E

Small {{works with a}} population equivalent (p. e.) under 2, 000 often employ horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HSSF CWs) {{as a means for}} subsequent tertiary (3 °) treatment. Although these significantly improve the final effluent’s quality, P release has, on occasions, been observed. This study attempts to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} P flux mechanisms in reed beds and to outline a mitigation strategy <b>countering</b> <b>P</b> release. The literature review identified that, in given circumstances, the P concentration gradient, redox conditions, pH and Fe cycling are key potential factors governing P flux. The field survey revealed that secondary (2 °) P effluent concentration negatively correlated with P release from the reed bed. In laboratory scale sludge reactor series, P concentration in wastewater was observed to be buffered by molecular diffusion driven by a concentration gradient in the sludge-wastewater interface. The instantaneous equilibrium point appeared to lie in 0. 1 to 0. 5 mg/L interval in the first 10 minutes, shifting to 1 mg/L in the next 8 hours and higher in the later stages. In biologically active systems, the shift of the equilibrium point seemed to be dominated by changes in redox potential linked to simultaneous microbial utilisation of oxygen (O 2) and nitrate (NO 3 -), eventually leading to a reduction of Fe (III) and sulphate (SO 4 2 -), with subsequent P release. The start of Fe (III) reduction coincided with reductive depletion of nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 -N) below 1 mg/L. In systems with limited biological activity, P release was linked to disassociation from Fe-P compounds under decreasing pH. In an experiment assessing hydrodynamics, an increase was recorded in Fe and P flux fluctuation due to convection. Based on the findings, maintaining hydraulic residence time (HRT) under 24 hours and reed bed influent in concentrations above 0. 5 mg/L total phosphorus (TP) and 15 mg/L NO 3 -N is proposed as a means to prevent or delay P release...|$|R

We generalize our approach to generic pæ 2 counters and we show that for explicit output computations our scheme requires at most four levels of gate delays for the interesting counters from the VLSI implementation point of view (that is pj 2 <b>counters</b> with <b>p</b> 127) and that counters with implicit output computations require at most three gate levels for the same size. Further, we investigate multiplication schemes using such counters, {{in combination with the}} Kautz's networks for symmetric Boolean functions. Using a 32 X 32 direct m [...] ...|$|R

The methods depend upon a parameter p > 0 and reduce to their classical <b>counter</b> parts as <b>p</b> → 0. The methods are periodically stable when the parameter p is chosen as {{the square of the}} frequency of the linear homogeneous equation. The numerical methods involving derivatives of order up to 2 q are of polynomial order 2 q and trigonometric order one. Numerical results are presented for both the linear and nonlinear problems.

Skeletal muscle possesses the full enzymatic machinery to generate S 1 P and expresses the transcripts of S 1 P receptors.

The exogenous application of S 1 <b>P</b> <b>counters</b> the reduction of muscle mass caused by denervation, while the neutralization of the extracellular lipid with a specific anti-S 1 P monoclonal antibody worsens the atrophy.

40|$|Catalytic {{properties}} of Pd/Au(111) nanostructures obtained by spontaneous palladium deposition using PdSO 4 and PdCl 2 salts were examined for the oxidation of ethanol in alkaline media. Atomic force microscopy {{has shown that}} <b>counter</b> anions in <b>Pd</b> salts {{are responsible for the}} differences in surface topography. In both cases the oxidation of ethanol is characterized by the rise of a new peak at approximately the same potential for the same coverage, indicating similar electronic modification of Pd islands by the Au(111) substrate. Pd/Au(111) nanostructures obtained using PdCl 2 salt have shown higher ethanol oxidation current densities, which can be ascribed to the surface structure consisting of thinner and smoother Pd deposit providing more convenient sites for the adsorption of ethanol and its subsequent oxidation...|$|R
40|$|We analyze noise {{properties}} of time series of frequency data from different counting modes of a Keysight 53230 A frequency counter. We use a 10 MHz reference signal from a passive hydrogen maser connected via phase-stable Huber+Suhner Sucoflex 104 cables to the reference and input connectors of the counter. We {{find that the}} high resolution gap-free (CONT) frequency counting process imposes long-term correlations in the output data, resulting in a modified Allan deviation that is characteristic of random walk phase noise. Equally important, the CONT mode results in a frequency bias. In contrast, the counter's undocumented raw continuous mode (RCON) yields unbiased frequency stability estimates with white phase noise characteristics, and of a magnitude consistent with the <b>counter's</b> 20 <b>ps</b> single-shot resolution. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a 100 -point running average filter {{in conjunction with the}} RCON mode yields resolution enhanced frequency estimates with flicker phase noise characteristics. For instance, the counter's built-in moving-average function can be used. The improved noise characteristics of the averaged RCON mode versus the CONT mode imply that the former mode yields frequency estimates with improved confidence for a given measurement time.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The newly {{discovered}} oncogenic protein gankyrin, which contains six ankyrin repeats, {{has been reported}} {{to be involved in the}} phosphorylation and degradation of the retinoblastoma gene product, Rb. Using in vitro systems, we have identified a peptide fragment of gankyrin, 176 LHLACDEERN 185, which is responsible for binding of gankyrin to Rb. We further demonstrated a different mechanism for gankyrin to facilitate the phosphorylation of Rb, by binding with cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK 4). This binding does not inhibit the Rb-phosphorylating kinase activity of CDK 4, but it competes with p 16 binding to CDK 4 and counteracts the inhibitory function of p 16. We then showed that binding of gankyrin to CDK 4 and the consequent <b>counter</b> action of <b>p</b> 16 function were not affected by the Rb-binding peptid...|$|R

The system, covering an area of 206 -square-meters, is composed of scintillation counters 5. 08 cm thick, 15 and 22 cm wide, and lengths which vary from 32 cm at the most forward angle to 450 cm at larger angles. All {{of the components of}} the system have been designed to optimize the time resolution.

These design styles are the use of clock-gating in the synthesis of synchronous circuits {{and the use of}} burst-mode machines in the synthesis of asynchronous circuits. Our evaluation consists of the design of a wellknown circuit, namely a counter. To make a fair comparison, we define a common environment to test the designed counters with the same stimuli. The power dissipation of each counter is determined using an accurate gate-level power estimator.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a 4 4 -state two-dimensional reversible cellular automaton called P 4 having very simple state-transition rules. We show that any reversible two-counter machine can be {{embedded in a}} finite configuration of P 4 very concisely. Since a reversible two-counter machine {{is known to be}} universal, P 4 has thus universal computing ability. It is a four-neighbor partitioned cellular automaton (PCA) where each cell is divided into four parts. Each part has the state set f 0; 1; 2; 3 g, hence a cell has 4 4 states. Besides reversibility, P 4 also satisfies the constraint of a number-conservation property, i. e., the total of the integers, which represent cells' states, over the configuration is conserved throughout its evolving process. Reversibility and number-conservation in CA can be regarded as properties that reflect reversibility and conservation of mass or energy in physics. In order to embed a reversible <b>counter</b> machine in <b>P</b> 4 space, we first design six kinds [...] ...|$|R
