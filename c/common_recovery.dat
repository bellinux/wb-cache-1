5000|$|Despite this, {{the real}} {{significance}} of the case in later centuries lay in the principle that was extracted from the judges' arguments about how the <b>common</b> <b>recovery</b> worked and how compensation should be made, even if commentators got the details (and name) of the case itself wrong, having never seen the Plea Roll. Most authorities followed Sir Edward Coke in attributing the <b>common</b> <b>recovery</b> to {{what became known as}} [...] "Taltarum's Case". It is now clear, however, that as a legal device, the <b>common</b> <b>recovery</b> predated 1472, possibly first appearing in the 1440s: Taltarum's Case added little beyond introducing, through the judges' deliberations, the device of the [...] "double voucher", though this did not become part of the <b>common</b> <b>recovery</b> until the mid 16th century. Nevertheless {{it seems likely that the}} example of Taltarum's Case served to popularise the procedure, as the annual number of recoveries was far greater in the decade after 1472 than in the previous decade.|$|E

50|$|Entails were {{originally}} designed to keep ownership of land within a family. Thanks {{to the effects of}} the statute De donis conditionalibus, the intent of the entail could not be broken, which meant that land in fee tail could not simply be sold, transferred, or mortgaged, as whatever the current owner did with it, ownership would automatically pass on their death to those specified by the entail. While entails performed a valuable function in the 13th century, when De donis conditionalibus was enacted, by the 15th century, changes in social and economic conditions meant that landowners were more concerned with being able to freely sell, convey or mortgage their land. It was in this time that the <b>common</b> <b>recovery</b> was devised as a way of circumventing De donis conditionalibus.|$|E
5000|$|Taltarum's Case is {{the name}} given to a 15th-century English legal case in the Court of Common Pleas that was {{generally}} thought to have established {{the operation of the}} <b>common</b> <b>recovery.</b> The latter was a collusive legal procedure designed to evade the statute De donis conditionalibus, and was for centuries an important element of English law of real property. The recovery operated to break an entail on freehold or copyhold property held in fee tail - which could not be freely sold or transferred - leaving it in fee simple, so that it could be freely sold or a new settlement arranged. Although recoveries had been used before the case to bar entails, the judges' extensive discussion of the principles involved meant that in succeeding centuries the common recovery's procedures, and even the names of some of the fictitious individuals involved in them, were modelled on the case.|$|E
5000|$|He was {{the fifth}} son of Thomas Danby of Danby, Yorkshire, and his wife Mary, {{daughter}} of Sir Robert Tanfield. He adopted the legal profession, and occurs in the year-books as early as 1431 in 1441 he appeared in a case before the privy council, and in 1443 was made serjeant-at-law, being promoted king's serjeant soon afterwards. He seems never to have sat in parliament, but on 28 June 1452 he was raised to the bench of common pleas. Being apparently of Yorkist sympathies, he was on 11 May 1461, immediately after the accession of Edward IV, appointed chief justice of common pleas he was knighted soon afterwards. When Henry VI regained his throne Danby was, by patent dated 9 October 1470, continued as chief justice, but when Edward IV returned {{in the following year}} Danby ceased to be chief justice. As he disappears from the list of judges three weeks before the others were removed, the circumstance may be due to his death, and not to his disgrace possibly the story which Holinshed erroneously relates of Sir William Hankford, of a chief justice who in this year deliberately got himself shot by his gamekeeper, refers to Danby. The frequency with which Danby's opinion was quoted suggests that he was a judge of considerable weight. He was the judge in the recovery referred to in Taltarum's Case, which gave rise to the doctrine of the <b>common</b> <b>recovery.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{essential}} principle {{behind the}} <b>common</b> <b>recovery,</b> {{the outline of}} which had probably been established in the mid fourteenth century, was that an entail could be broken if the issue (i.e. the persons who would otherwise have received the land under the entail) were compensated. The process worked as follows. The owner (in tail) of the land, A, wished to convert it from fee tail to fee simple. Accordingly, he conveyed {{it to someone else}} B (known as the tenant in praecipe, usually a lawyer acting for the owner) to the intent that a third person C (known as the demandant, and usually an estate trustee or the purchaser, if the land was being sold) might sue for it. C accordingly issued a writ against B, saying he had been unjustly dispossessed of the land by a (fictitious) individual usually named as [...] "Hugh Hunt". In court, B defended his right saying (correctly) that he had acquired it from A. A (now called the vouchee) was called upon to vouch for his right to the land. He alleged that he had acquired it from D (a person known as the common vouchee, and whose part was usually played by the court crier). D asked for time and failed to appear subsequently; alternatively, he dashed out of the court. In either case, the judgment was that C should recover the land, and that D should compensate B with land of equal value. However, D was chosen because {{he was a man of}} straw with no property at all, so that the judgment against him was valueless, and it was never enforced. The result was thus that C recovered land in fee simple, which A had owned in only fee tail; the entail was barred. The land could now be freely sold or transferred or a new settlement made, thus defeating De donis conditionalibus.|$|E
40|$|Web {{services}} {{have proven to}} be a viable solution for inter-operability issues. Since end users do not buy services, but only interact with them remotely, such complex systems end up having a distributed ownership, meaning different parts of a system can evolve independently. This has brought researchers to concentrate on run-time management issues such as dynamic monitoring and self-recovery. However, we advocate that no silver bullet has been found. All the major approaches have advantages and disadvan-tages. In this paper we propose a unified framework for monitoring and recovery that provides a clear separation be-tween data collection and analysis, a common management infrastructure, and a <b>common</b> <b>recovery</b> system. Separating monitoring from recovery allows the framework to integrate different monitoring approaches seamlessly through a plug-in approach.
