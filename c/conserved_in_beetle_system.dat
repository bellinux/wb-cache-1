40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} demonstrated that adhesive tarsal setae of beetles possess material gradients along their length. These gradients presumably represent an evolutionary optimization enhancing the adaptation to rough surfaces while simultaneously preventing clusterisation of the setae by lateral collapse. The numerical experiment {{of the present}} study has clearly demonstrated that gradient-bearing fibers with short soft tips and stiff bases have greater advantage in maximizing adhesion and minimizing clusterisation in multiple attachment–detachment cycles, if compared to the fibers with longer soft tips on the stiff bases and fibers with stiff tips on the soft bases. This study not only manifests the crucial role of gradients in material properties along the setae <b>in</b> <b>beetle</b> fibrillar adhesive <b>system,</b> but predicts that similar gradients must have been convergently evolved in various lineages of arthropods...|$|R
40|$|Tree-killing {{bark beetles}} depend on {{aggregation}} pheromones to mass-attack their host trees and overwhelm their resistance. The beetles are always associated with phytopathogenic ophiostomatoid fungi that probably assist in breaking down tree resistance, but {{little is known}} about if or how much these fungal symbionts contribute to the beetles’ aggregation behavior. In this study, we determined the ability of four major fungal symbionts of the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus to produce beetle aggregation pheromones. The fungi were incubated on Norway spruce Picea abies bark, malt agar, or malt agar amended with 0. 5 % 13 C glucose. Volatiles present in the headspace of each fungus were analyzed for 7 days after incubation using a SPME autosampler coupled to a GC/MS. Two Grosmannia species (G. penicillata and G. europhioides) produced large amounts of 2 -methyl- 3 -buten- 2 -ol (MB), the major component in the beetles’ aggregation pheromone blend, when growing on spruce bark or malt agar. Grosmannia europhioides also incorporated 13 C glucose into MB, demonstrating that the fungi can synthesize MB de novo using glucose as a carbon source. This is the first clear evidence that fungal symbionts of bark beetles can produce components in the aggregation pheromone blend of their beetle vectors. This provides new insight into the possible ecological roles of fungal symbionts <b>in</b> bark <b>beetle</b> <b>systems</b> and may deepen our understanding of species interactions and coevolution in these important biological systems.

40|$|Small {{urban forest}} {{reserves}} in New Zealand {{have been shown}} to have value <b>in</b> <b>conserving</b> indigenous <b>beetle</b> diversity. However there is little information available on the ability of non-native vegetation areas such as tree privet to support indigenous beetle assemblages. To investigate this for one site, ground-living beetles were collected using pitfall traps over a year at a small urban forest of the invasive tree Ligustrum lucidum (tree privet) in Auckland, New Zealand. A total of 815 beetles were found, from 20 families and 42 relative taxonomic units. Using monthly data, there was no correlation between soil moisture and diversity index (P = 0. 805) or species richness (P = 0. 375). These results raise the question of whether urban patches of non-native tree privet may have potential as reservoirs of beetle diversity, if only until they are replaced with native vegetation...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: Carabid beetles {{are among}} the most {{important}} elements of the natural environment’s resistance in arable fields. In this paper, the influence of different soil tillage <b>systems</b> on carabid <b>beetle</b> assemblages <b>in</b> oilseed rape plantations was studied. Materials and methods: The experiment was conducted in northeastern Poland. Six fields with oilseed rape cultivated under both conventional and non-inversion tillage systems were chosen. Barber traps were used to capture beetles. Results and conclusions: In total 9, 968 individuals belonging to 56 species were collected. Significant differences in the abundance and species richness of ground <b>beetles</b> <b>in</b> two <b>systems</b> of soil tillage were observed. The abundance and species richness were significantly higher in the non-inversion tillage system. Analysis of the life history traits of carabids also revealed statistically significant differences in the seasonal occurrence of carabids related to the type of soil cultivation used. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the capacity of}} Ammophorus rubripes beetles to carry Taenia solium eggs, in terms of duration and viability of eggs in their digestive <b>system.</b> One hundred <b>beetles</b> were distributed into five polyethylene boxes, {{and then they were}} infected with T. solium eggs. Gravid proglottids of T. solium were crushed and then mixed with cattle feces. One gram of this mixture was placed in each box for 24 hours, after which each group of beetles was transferred into a new clean box. Then, five beetles were dissected every three days. Time was strongly associated with viability (r= 0. 89; P< 0. 001) and the calculated time to cero viability is 36 days. The eggs in the intestinal <b>system</b> of each <b>beetle</b> were counted and tested for viability. Taenia solium eggs were present <b>in</b> the <b>beetle's</b> digestive <b>system</b> for up to 39 days (13 th sampling day out of 20), gradually reducing in numbers and viability, which was 0 on day 36 post-infection.
