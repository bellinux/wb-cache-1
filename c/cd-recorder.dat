However, specialized software can produce perfect clones of such CD-ROMs, although the process is very time-consuming. What the vendors are thinking when they say [...] "physically impossible" [...] is probably that copying the protection requires technical features that the installed base of standard CD-ROM and <b>CD-recorder</b> drives do not have. Then, what they mean is [...] "technically impossible with a typical drive," [...] but that is still wrong, because with clever techniques it is technically possible, as the existence of programs that do it proves. No doubt, it would not even take excessive time if a specialized CD reader that made these workarounds unnecessary was available.|$|E

Different from conventional methods, such as CNC-machining and photolithography techniques used for prototyping, and also various molding methods adopted for mass production, {{the use of}} <b>CD-Recorder</b> to fabricate laboratory-on-a-CD provides a simple and intuitive approach. For demonstrating the patterning capability of <b>CD-Recorder</b> here, on the same piece of CD-R, outer layer patterned with microfluidic structures selected from the published laboratory-on-a-CD devices for enzymatic assay; inner layer encoded with digital information, represented by a piece of music, implies its potential integration in automatic control of analytical procedures and programmatic data analysis. Since the duration necessary for producing a piece of laboratory-on-a-CD using <b>CD-Recorder</b> is less than 20 minutes, it shows advantageous in fast prototyping. Although current <b>CD-Recorder</b> and CD-R, is initially designed for storing digital information, however, in addition to photolithography and soft lithography, it could be modified to accommodate our proposed alternative function to fabricate microfluidic systems...|$|E

With the help of a <b>CD-recorder</b> now every creative musician will be in the lucky position to offer his works suitable to the media in the widespread format of the compact disk. This is not the case only for the indivudual who works at his computer as a homerecording musician, even bands that have to depend on a convincingly high quality production and are going to submit their demo recordings to potential music promoters, can profit by the new technology. Now the disadvantages of audio cassettes can be forgotten: Finally musicians can always rely {{on the fact that the}} songs they like to present will run exactly with the same - and correct - speed everywhere, they never again have to defend a muddy sound of their recordings by azimuth-problems of a maladjusted playback head. As promoters and public relation-departments of record companies are constantly inundated by sound carriers of all possible formats, it should be clear that there is no time to listen to all of the material. A compact disk will have far more chances to be played at all. In addition to the burning process the new media allows further, musically creative processing by means of the CD-burning software. So the arrangement of pauses between tracks or their length should not play an underrated part: Shall the tracks blend without a pause or will the following track be more effective when introduced by a long break? Even subsequent fading as well as intensive filtering are integrated software options for additional processing. It goes without saying that the succession of the tracks is exchangeable and can be adjusted to specific needs. As an extra of the CD-burning software comes the possibility to design covers, booklets and labels to give oneÂ´s own productions an individual character. At present, the procedure is not suited for quantity production, as the burning of a blank CD-R medium lasts as long as the real playing time, not to mention all preparing steps. It is, however, sufficient for a small number of copies. According to new innovations in the computing industry, there will be faster devices in a short term after all. Nevertheless, a CD-burner is one of the daily used parts of equipment for creative musicians. The technical innovation has willingly been accepted...|$|E
