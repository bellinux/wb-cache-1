5|$|An {{example of}} an enzyme that {{contains}} a <b>cofactor</b> is carbonic anhydrase, which {{is shown in the}} ribbon diagram above with a zinc <b>cofactor</b> bound as part of its active site. These tightly bound ions or molecules are usually found in the active site and are involved in catalysis. For example, flavin and heme cofactors are often involved in redox reactions.|$|E
5|$|In {{animals and}} plants, a {{tricyclic}} compound called molybdopterin (which, despite the name, contains no molybdenum) is reacted with molybdate {{to form a}} complete molybdenum-containing <b>cofactor</b> called molybdenum <b>cofactor.</b> Other than the phylogenetically-ancient nitrogenases (discussed above) that fix nitrogen in some bacteria and cyanobacteria, all molybdenum-using enzymes (so far identified) use the molybdenum <b>cofactor,</b> where molybdenum is in the oxidation state of VI, similar to molybdate. Molybdenum enzymes in plants and animals catalyze the oxidation and sometimes reduction of certain small molecules {{in the process of}} regulating nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum {{deficiency}} {{has also}} been reported {{as a consequence of}} non-molybdenum supplemented total parenteral nutrition (complete intravenous feeding) for long periods of time. It results in high blood levels of sulfite and urate, {{in much the same way}} as molybdenum <b>cofactor</b> deficiency. However (presumably since pure molybdenum deficiency from this cause occurs primarily in adults), the neurological consequences are not as marked as in cases of congenital <b>cofactor</b> deficiency.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cofactors</b> can {{be divided}} into two broad groups: organic <b>Cofactors,</b> such as flavin or heme, and {{inorganic}} <b>cofactors,</b> such as the metal ions Mg2+, Cu+, Mn2+, or iron-sulfur clusters.|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{nicotinamide}} <b>cofactors</b> are analogues of {{the natural}} <b>cofactors</b> used by oxidoreductases as redox intermediates.

5|$|Copper {{is needed}} by the body {{for a number of}} functions, {{predominantly}} as a <b>cofactor</b> for a number of enzymes such as ceruloplasmin, cytochrome c oxidase, dopamine β-hydroxylase, superoxide dismutase and tyrosinase.|$|E
5|$|Some of the cofactors {{also require}} their own synthesis. Deficiency in any {{required}} amino acid or <b>cofactor</b> can impair {{the synthesis of}} dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{itself is}} used as {{precursor}} in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and epinephrine. Dopamine is converted into norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase, with O2 and L-ascorbic acid as cofactors. Norepinephrine is converted into epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase with S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the <b>cofactor.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{reaction}} center comprises several (>10 or >11) protein subunits, {{that provide}} a scaffold {{for a series of}} <b>cofactors.</b> The <b>cofactors</b> can be pigments (like chlorophyll, pheophytin, carotenoids), quinones, or iron-sulfur clusters.|$|R
5|$|Some enzymes do {{not need}} {{additional}} components to show full activity. Others require non-protein molecules called <b>cofactors</b> to be bound for activity. <b>Cofactors</b> can be either inorganic (e.g., metal ions and iron-sulfur clusters) or organic compounds (e.g., flavin and heme). These <b>cofactors</b> serve many purposes; for instance, metal ions can help in stabilizing nucleophilic species within the active site. Organic <b>cofactors</b> can be either coenzymes, which are released from the enzyme's active site during the reaction, or prosthetic groups, which are tightly bound to an enzyme. Organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound (e.g., biotin in enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase).|$|R
25|$|Vitamins {{can serve}} as {{precursors}} to many organic <b>cofactors</b> (e.g., vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12, niacin, folic acid) or as coenzymes themselves (e.g., vitamin C). However, vitamins do have other functions in the body. Many organic <b>cofactors</b> also contain a nucleotide, such as the electron carriers NAD and FAD, and coenzyme A, which carries acyl groups. Most of these <b>cofactors</b> are found in a huge variety of species, and some are universal to all forms of life. An exception to this wide distribution {{is a group of}} unique <b>cofactors</b> that evolved in methanogens, which are restricted to this group of archaea.|$|R
5|$|Enzymes {{that require}} a <b>cofactor</b> but do not have one bound are called apoenzymes or apoproteins. An enzyme {{together}} with the cofactor(s) required for activity is called a holoenzyme (or haloenzyme). The term holoenzyme can also be applied to enzymes that contain multiple protein subunits, such as the DNA polymerases; here the holoenzyme is the complete complex containing all the subunits needed for activity.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum is an {{essential}} <b>cofactor</b> for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, although the great chemical similarity of the lanthanides means {{that it may be}} substituted with cerium, praseodymium, or neodymium without ill effects, and with the smaller samarium, europium, or gadolinium giving no side effects other than slower growth.|$|E
5|$|Selenium is a {{component}} of the unusual amino acids selenocysteine and selenomethionine. In humans, selenium is a trace element nutrient that functions as <b>cofactor</b> for reduction of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase found in animals and some plants (this enzyme occurs in all living organisms, but not all forms of it in plants require selenium).|$|E

40|$|Transcriptional <b>cofactors</b> are {{integral}} to the proper function and regulation of nuclear receptors. Members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family of nuclear receptors {{are involved in the}} regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. They modulate gene transcription in response {{to a wide variety of}} ligands, a process that is mediated by transcriptional coactivators and corepressors. The mechanisms by which these <b>cofactors</b> mediate transcriptional regulation of nuclear receptor function are still being elucidated. The rapidly increasing array of <b>cofactors</b> has brought into focus the need for a clear understanding of how these <b>cofactors</b> interact in ligand- and cell-specific manners. This review highlights the differential effects of the assorted <b>cofactors</b> regulating the transcriptional action of PPARÃŽÂ³ and summarizes the recent advances in understanding the physiological functions of corepressors and coactivators...|$|R
40|$|The {{developmental}} {{regulation of}} LIM homeodomain transcription factors (LIM-HD) by the LIM domain-binding <b>cofactors</b> CLIM/Ldb/NLI and RLIM has been demonstrated. Whereas CLIM <b>cofactors</b> {{are thought to}} be required for {{at least some of the}} in vivo functions of LIM-HD proteins, the ubiquitin ligase RLIM functions as a negative regulator by its ability to target CLIM <b>cofactors</b> for proteasomal degradation. In this report, we have investigated and compared the protein expression of both factors in the developing mouse neural tube. We co-localize both proteins in many tissues and, although widely expressed, we detect high levels of both <b>cofactors</b> in specific neural tube regions, e. g., in the ventral neural tube, where motor neurons reside. The mostly ubiquitous distribution of RLIM- and CLIM-encoding mRNA differs from the more specific expression of both <b>cofactors</b> at the protein level, indicating post-transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, we show that both <b>cofactors</b> not only co-localize with each other but also with Isl and Lhx 3 LIM-HD proteins in developing ventral neural tube neurons. Our results demonstrate the dynamic expression of <b>cofactors</b> participating in the regulation of LIM-HD proteins during the development of the neural tube in mice and suggest additional post-transcriptional regulation in the nuclear LIM-HD protein network...|$|R
5|$|Calcium is {{the fifth}} most {{abundant}} element {{in the human body}} and the most abundant metal. Calcium ions {{play a vital role in}} the physiology and biochemistry of organisms and the cell as electrolytes. They play an important role in signal transduction pathways, where they act as a second messenger, in neurotransmitter release from neurons, in contraction of all muscle cell types, and in fertilization. Many enzymes require calcium ions as a <b>cofactor.</b> Calcium ions outside cells are also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper bone formation.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes are not rigid, static structures; {{instead they}} have complex {{internal}} dynamic motions – that is, {{movements of parts}} of the enzyme's structure such as individual amino acid residues, groups of residues forming a protein loop or unit of secondary structure, or even an entire protein domain. These motions {{give rise to a}} conformational ensemble of slightly different structures that interconvert with one another at equilibrium. Different states within this ensemble may be associated with different aspects of an enzyme's function. For example, different conformations of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase are associated with the substrate binding, catalysis, <b>cofactor</b> release, and product release steps of the catalytic cycle.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} causes for the {{pathology}} of lead is that it interferes with the activity of an essential enzyme called delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, or ALAD (see image of the enzyme structure), which {{is important in the}} biosynthesis of heme, the <b>cofactor</b> found in hemoglobin. Lead also inhibits the enzyme ferrochelatase, another enzyme involved in the formation of heme. Ferrochelatase catalyzes the joining of protoporphyrin and Fe2+ to form heme. Lead's interference with heme synthesis results in production of zinc protoporphyrin and the development of anemia. Another effect of lead's interference with heme synthesis is the buildup of heme precursors, such as aminolevulinic acid, which may be directly or indirectly harmful to neurons.|$|E
40|$|Intramolecular {{electron}} transfer within proteins {{is an essential}} process in bioenergetics. Redox <b>cofactors</b> are embedded in proteins, and this matrix strongly influ-ences their redox potential. Several <b>cofactors</b> are usu-ally found in these complexes, and they are structurally organized in a chain with distances between the elec-tron donor and acceptor short enough to allow rapid electron tunneling. Among the different interactions {{that contribute to the}} determination of the redox poten-tial of these <b>cofactors,</b> electrostatic interactions are im-portant but restive to direct experimental characteriza-tion. The influence of interaction between <b>cofactors</b> is evidenced here experimentally by means of redox titra-tions and time-resolved spectroscopy in a chimeric bac-terial reaction center (Maki, H., Matsuura, K., Shimada...|$|R
50|$|The {{transition}} metals are usually present as trace elements in organisms, with zinc and iron being most abundant. These metals {{are used in}} some proteins as <b>cofactors</b> and are essential for the activity of enzymes such as catalase and oxygen-carrier proteins such as hemoglobin. These <b>cofactors</b> are bound tightly to a specific protein; although enzyme <b>cofactors</b> can be modified during catalysis, <b>cofactors</b> always return to their original state after catalysis has taken place. The metal micronutrients are taken up into organisms by specific transporters and bound to storage proteins such as ferritin or metallothionein when not being used. Cobalt {{is essential for the}} functioning of vitamin B12.|$|R
40|$|Electron {{transfers}} {{within and}} between protein complexes are core processes of the electron transport chains occurring in thylakoid (chloroplast), mitochondrial, and bacterial membranes. These electron transfers involve a number of <b>cofactors.</b> Here we describe the derivation of molecular Mechanics parameters for the <b>cofactors</b> associated with {{the function of the}} photosystem II core complex: plastoquinone, plastoquinol, heme b, chlorophyll A, pheophytin, and beta-carotene. Parameters were also obtained for ubiquinol and ubiquinone, related <b>cofactors</b> involved in the respiratory chain Parameters were derived at both atomistic and coarse grain (CG) resolutions, compatible with the building blocks of the GROMOS united-atom and Martini CG force fields, respectively. Structural and thermodynamic properties of the <b>cofactors</b> were compared to experimental values when available. The topologies were further tested in molecular dynamics simulations of the <b>cofactors</b> in their physiological environment, e. g., either in a lipid membrane environment or in complex with the heme binding protein bacterioferritin...|$|R
5|$|Phototrophic archaea use {{light to}} produce {{chemical}} {{energy in the}} form of ATP. In the Halobacteria, light-activated ion pumps like bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin generate ion gradients by pumping ions out of the cell across the plasma membrane. The energy stored in these electrochemical gradients is then converted into ATP by ATP synthase. This process is a form of photophosphorylation. The ability of these light-driven pumps to move ions across membranes depends on light-driven changes in the structure of a retinol <b>cofactor</b> buried {{in the center of the}} protein.|$|E
5|$|The {{conformational}} {{mobility of}} serpins provides a key advantage over static lock-and-key protease inhibitors. In particular, {{the function of}} inhibitory serpins can be regulated by allosteric interactions with specific cofactors. The X-ray crystal structures of antithrombin, heparin <b>cofactor</b> II, MENT and murine antichymotrypsin reveal that these serpins adopt a conformation wherein the first two amino acids of the RCL are inserted {{into the top of}} the A β-sheet. The partially inserted conformation is important because co-factors are able to conformationally switch certain partially inserted serpins into a fully expelled form. This conformational rearrangement makes the serpin a more effective inhibitor.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary cause}} of lead's {{toxicity}} is its interference {{with a variety of}} enzymes because it binds to sulfhydryl groups found on many enzymes. Part of lead's toxicity results from its ability to mimic other metals that take part in biological processes, which act as cofactors in many enzymatic reactions, displacing them at the enzymes on which they act. Lead is able to bind to and interact with many of the same enzymes as these metals but, due to its differing chemistry, does not properly function as a <b>cofactor,</b> thus interfering with the enzyme's ability to catalyze its normal reaction or reactions. Among the essential metals with which lead interacts are calcium, iron, and zinc.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: All organisms use <b>cofactors</b> {{to extend}} the {{catalytic}} capacities of proteins. Many bacteria and archaea can synthesize <b>cofactors</b> from primary metabolites, {{but there are also}} prokaryotes that do not have the complete biosynthetic pathways for all essential <b>cofactors.</b> These organisms are dependent on the uptake of <b>cofactors,</b> or at least their precursors that cannot be synthesized, from the environment. Even in those organisms that contain complete biosynthetic pathways membrane transporters are usually present, because the synthesis of <b>cofactors</b> is more costly than uptake. SCOPE OF REVIEW: Here we give an overview of bacterial and archaeal transport systems for B-type vitamins, which are either <b>cofactors</b> or precursors thereof. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Prokaryotic vitamin transporters are extremely diverse, and found in many families of transporters. A few of these transport systems have been characterized in detail, but for most of them mechanistic insight is lacking. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The lack of structural and functional understanding of bacterial vitamin transporters is unfortunate because they may be targets for new antibiotics.

40|$|Abstract: Nicotinamide {{containing}} <b>cofactors</b> are {{ubiquitous in}} biological systems. As a result, when studying nicotinamide dependent systems in vitro or in vivo, isotopically labeled nicotinamide <b>cofactors</b> {{are often used}} to reveal the mechanism of the biological system of interest. The reduced form of these <b>cofactors</b> is labile and is sensitive to light, oxygen, pH, temperature and other factors. Consequently, their synthesis, purification, analysis, and preservation have been an ongoing challenge. Due to these stability issues, studies using nicotinamide <b>cofactors,</b> especially those utilizing the reduced forms, have been relegated to repetitive cycles of synthesizing the needed material just prior to experimental use. Such practice is not practical in studies utilizing complex isotopic labeling patterns. Many of the efforts that have been reported for synthesis, separation and long-term preservation of the various nicotinamide <b>cofactors,</b> led to procedures that are no longer practical or cost effective while others present the best solutions available today. Some of these efforts are presented and compared in this mini-review. Herein we describe our analytical and synthetic methodologies for the synthesis, separation, purification, analysis and long term preservation of labile nicotinamide <b>cofactors,</b> which achieve excellent versatility, yields, purity, HPLC resolution, and long term stability...|$|R

Organic <b>cofactors</b> can be either coenzymes, which are released from the enzyme's active site during the reaction, or prosthetic groups, which are tightly bound to an enzyme. Organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound (e.g., biotin in enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase).|$|R
5|$|Research into fungal prions {{has given}} strong {{support to the}} protein-only concept, since {{purified}} protein extracted from cells with a prion state has been demonstrated to convert the normal form of the protein into a misfolded form in vitro, and in the process, preserve the information corresponding to different strains of the prion state. It has also {{shed some light on}} prion domains, which are regions in a protein that promote the conversion into a prion. Fungal prions have helped to suggest mechanisms of conversion that may apply to all prions, though fungal prions appear distinct from infectious mammalian prions in the lack of <b>cofactor</b> required for propagation. The characteristic prion domains may vary between species—e.g., characteristic fungal prion domains are not found in mammalian prions.|$|E
5|$|Succinate-Q oxidoreductase, {{also known}} as complex II or succinate dehydrogenase, is a second entry point to the {{electron}} transport chain. It is unusual {{because it is the}} only enzyme that is part of both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) <b>cofactor,</b> iron–sulfur clusters, and a heme group that does not participate in electron transfer to coenzyme Q, but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species. It oxidizes succinate to fumarate and reduces ubiquinone. As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH, complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient.|$|E
5|$|When {{bound to}} a protein, NAD and NADH are usually held within a {{structural}} motif {{known as the}} Rossmann fold. The motif is named after Michael Rossmann {{who was the first}} scientist to notice how common this structure is within nucleotide-binding proteins. This fold contains three or more parallel beta strands linked by two alpha helices in the order beta-alpha-beta-alpha-beta. This forms a beta sheet flanked by a layer of alpha helices on each side. Because each Rossmann fold binds one nucleotide, binding domains for NAD consist of two paired Rossmann folds, with each fold binding one of the two nucleotides of the <b>cofactor.</b> However, this fold is not universal among NAD-dependent enzymes, since a class of bacterial enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism have recently been discovered that bind the coenzyme, but lack this motif.|$|E
50|$|Some enzymes utilize non-amino acid <b>cofactors</b> such as pyridoxal {{phosphate}} (PLP) or thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) to form covalent intermediates with reactant molecules. Such covalent intermediates function {{to reduce the}} energy of later transition states, similar to how covalent intermediates formed with active site amino acid residues allow stabilization, but the capabilities of <b>cofactors</b> allow enzymes to carryout reactions that amino acid side residues alone could not. Enzymes utilizing such <b>cofactors</b> include the PLP-dependent enzyme aspartate transaminase and the TPP-dependent enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase.|$|R
