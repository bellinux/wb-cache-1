40|$|A liamba (Vitex {{agnus castus}} L.) é utilizada no Brasil como {{medicinal}} e apresenta compostos com estrutura química semelhante à progesterona. Visando avaliar a propagação vegetativa de liamba foram conduzidos dois experimentos. O primeiro, com estacas da parte aérea com 20 cm de comprimento, sem folhas e classificadas em dois grupos: apical e basal. As estacas tiveram a espessura padronizada em 3 a 5 mm de diâmetro e 40 unidades de cada tipo foram colocadas em sacolas de polietileno (10 x 30 cm) preenchidas com o substrato solo + esterco na proporção volumétrica de 2 : 1. O segundo, com miniestacas da parte aérea da planta com 3 a 5 cm de comprimento, sem folhas e no delineamento experimental em blocos casualizados com quatro repetições de 20 miniestacas, no esquema fatorial 2 x 3. Os tratamentos foram tipo da miniestaca (com talão e sem talão) e substrato (solo; solo + esterco bovino curtido e solo + composto). A propagação vegetativa de liamba pode ser feita por estacas basais ou mini-estacas com talão em substrato solo + composto. The liamba (Vitex agnus castus L.) {{is used as}} a medicinal species in Brazil and presents compounds with similar chemical structure to progesterone. To evaluate the propagation of liamba two experiments were carried out. The first, using shoot <b>cuttings</b> <b>with</b> 20 cm long, leafless and classified into two groups, apical and basal. The cuttings were standardized in their thickness of 3 to 5 mm in diameter and 40 units of each type were placed in polyethylene bags (10 x 30 cm) filled with soil + manure in the volumetric ratio of 2 : 1. The second, with shoot minicuttings of the plant canopy with 3 to 5 cm long, without leaves and in a randomized block experimental design with four replications of 20 minicuttings, in a factorial 2 x 3. The treatments were kind of mini-cuttings (with and without hell) and substrate (soil, soil + cattle manure and soil + compost). The vegetative propagation of liamba can be made by basal <b>cuttings</b> or minicuttings <b>with</b> <b>heel</b> in soil + compost...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Injuries in {{the lower}} {{extremity}} are considered to have multifactorial causes, whilst people <b>with</b> <b>heel</b> pain represent the most frequent cause of visits to health professionals. Managing these patients can be very difficult. The purpose {{of this research is}} to identify key variables which can influence foot health in patients <b>with</b> <b>heel</b> pain. Materials and method: A cross-sectional observational study was carried out with a sample of sixty-two participants recruited from the Educational Welfare Unit of the University of Malaga. The therapists, blinded for the study, fill in the data with anthropometric information and the FPI, while participants fill in the foot health status questionnaire, FHSQ. The most significant results reveal that there is a moderate relation between the clinical variables and the FHSQ commands. The most significant contribution is the BMI in the foot health status questionnaire. Conclusion: The variables which can help manage clinical subjects <b>with</b> <b>heel</b> pain are age, BMI, footwear and FPI (left foot) ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Plantar heel pain is {{a common}} foot {{disorder}} aggravated by weight-bearing activity. Despite considerable focus on therapeutic interventions such as orthoses, there has been limited investigation of footwear-related issues in people <b>with</b> plantar <b>heel</b> pain. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether people <b>with</b> plantar <b>heel</b> pain experience footwear-related difficulties compared to asymptomatic individuals, as well as identifying factors associated with footwear comfort, fit and choice. Methods: The footwear domain of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire (FHSQ) was assessed in 192 people <b>with</b> plantar <b>heel</b> pain and 69 asymptomatic controls. The plantar heel pain group was also assessed on a variety of measures including: foot posture, foot strength and flexibility, pedobarography and pain level. A univariate analysis of covariance, with age as the covariate, was used to compare the heel pain and control groups on the FHSQ footwear domain score. A multiple regression model was then constructed to investigate factors associated with footwear scores among participants <b>with</b> plantar <b>heel</b> pain. Results: When compared to asymptomatic participants, people <b>with</b> plantar <b>heel</b> pain reported lower FHSQ footwear domain scores (mean difference − 24. 4; p < 0. 001; 95 % CI: − 32. 0 to − 17. 0). In the participants <b>with</b> <b>heel</b> pain, footwear scores were associated with maximum force beneath the postero-lateral heel during barefoo...|$|R

40|$|The study {{discloses}} the scopes of {{clonal propagation}} Swietenia macrophylla through branch <b>cutting</b> treated <b>with</b> IBA. A {{total of four}} hundred <b>cuttings</b> were used <b>with</b> four replications to assess the rooting ability. The study exposed significant (p< 0. 5) difference of rooted cuttings among the treatments. The highest (62. 51 %) rooting percent was observed in <b>cutting</b> <b>with</b> 0. 4 % IBA treatment. In addition, root number and its length per <b>cutting</b> were increased <b>with</b> increasing IBA concentration (p< 0. 5). The experiment showed significant (p< 0. 5) difference of sprouting among the treatments. The highest (67. 27 %) percent of sprouting was observed in <b>cuttings</b> <b>with</b> 0. 4 % solution, which showed a similar fashion of percent of rooting. The study also showed significant (p< 0. 5) difference of shoot number per cutting, {{the length of the}} longest shoot, and number of leaves per cutting among the treatments. The overall survival of rooted cuttings after transfer to polybag significantly (p< 0. 5) differed among the <b>cuttings</b> treated <b>with</b> different IBA solution. The highest survival percentage (69. 67 %) was observed in the <b>cuttings</b> rooted <b>with</b> 0. 4 % IBA treatment and the lowest (55. 6 %) survival was found in <b>cuttings</b> treated <b>with</b> control.
