30|$|Many {{technical}} {{applications for}} MnP {{have been reported}} with promising results. The utilization of the enzyme is still dependent on a cost-effective recombinant production process and possibly the discovery of more robust novel isoenzymes or modifications of the currently known ones. Furthermore, optimization of enzymatic treatment processes for various technical lignins (Vishtal &Kraslawski 2011), paper pulps (Maijala et al. 2008;Xu et al. 2010) and organopollutants (Sack et al. 1997) with proper process conditions and <b>co-oxidants</b> will probably increase the interest in MnP. Delignification of pinewood sawdust using a MnP treatment {{in this study was}} relatively inefficient. The use of several <b>co-oxidants</b> and other enzymes involved in biological ligninolysis may help to achieve more thorough enzymatic delignification demonstrated by many MnP producing and LiP-negative white-rot fungi (Hammel &Cullen 2008). In previous laboratory experiments byHofrichter et al. (1998) andKapich et al. (1999) Mineralization and solubilization of synthetic (14 C-labeled) large molecular weight lignin by MnP has been reported. These and various other studies suggest that isolated MnP enzymes can be used to delignify biomasses. However, for now the utilization of class II peroxidases to degrade polluting substances in soils is technically more appealing.|$|R

The position of the v(Ru=O) bands of the complexes 1 correlate with the Hammett σ 1 (or Taft σ*) and Pauling-type electronegativity values of the substituents on the pyridine ring. A comparative study of most of these complexes as both stoichiometric and catalytic oxidants for the oxidation of 1 -hexanol to hexanal was carried out. The known dioxoruthenium(VI) compound [PPh 4][RuO 2 (OCOCH 3) CI 2] (a) and a range of new compounds [PPh 4][RuO 2 (OCOR) CI 2] (R = CF 3 b, C 6 H 5 c, C 6 F 5 d, C 5 H 11 e) were synthesized and characterized. High synthetic yields were obtained for the fluorinated complexes b and d relative to their protonated equivalents a and c, possibly due to the varying charge distributions within such complexes. No clear trend in catalytic activity was noticed on varying the ligand on the ruthenium for the oxidation of 1 -hexanol and 2 -hexanol to hexanal and 2 -hexanone respectively, with a range of <b>co-oxidants.</b> The complexes c and d were used very successfully in the catalytic oxidations of a variety of alcohols with the <b>co-oxidants</b> tetrabutylammonium periodate and 4 -methylmorpholine N-oxide.

40|$|In {{the last}} years {{ruthenium}} tetroxide is increasingly being used in organic synthesis. Thanks to the fine tuning of the reaction conditions, including pH control of the medium {{and the use of}} a wider range of <b>co-oxidants,</b> this species {{has proven to be a}} reagent able to catalyse useful synthetic transformations which are either a valuable alternative to established methods or even, in some cases, the method of choice. Protocols for oxidation of hydrocarbons, oxidative cleavage of C-C double bonds, even stopping the process at the aldehyde stage, oxidative cleavage of terminal and internal alkynes, oxidation of alcohols to carboxylic acids, dihydroxylation of alkenes, oxidative degradation of phenyl and other heteroaromatic nuclei, oxidative cyclization of dienes, have now reached a good level of improvement and are more and more included into complex synthetic sequences. The perruthenate ion is a ruthenium (VII) oxo-species.

40|$|Nitroxides {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely {{investigated}} classes of 2 ̆ 2 stable 2 ̆ 2 free radicals in the chemical, biological and medical sciences owing to their potential applications such as antioxidants, spin-labels, <b>co-oxidants,</b> building blocks for practical organic magnets, controlled free-radical polymerization, EPR and NMR (MRI) based contrast reagents. Central to the progress on these investigations has been the understanding of the effects of orientation (bond torsions), distance, and structure of different coupling units controlling the spin-spin interaction between two and more nitroxide spin moieties. Attachment of nitroxides on a rigid framework, which limits the extent of conformational change, is a necessary step towards addressing these effects on spin-spin exchange qualitatively and quantitatively. ^ Calix[4]arenes immobilized in a 1, 3 -alternate conformation are structurally rigid with a cylindrical inner tunnel and possess two cofacial pairs of aromatic rings oriented orthogonal along the cavity axis. From numerous X-ray studies, the distance between the cofacial pair of aromatic rings has been found to be 5 [...] 6 Å. This arrangement allows one to study the through-bond (spin polarization of the σ- and π-core) and through-space (overlap of the singly-occupied p-orbitals) mechanism of exchange coupling by attaching two or four nitroxide moieties respectively on the aromatic rings. The design principle, synthetic methods, EPR and magnetic studies for stable nitroxide radicals presented in Chapter 1 were used for the synthesis and characterization of the 1, 3 -alternate calix[4]arene nitroxide diradical and tetraradical described in Chapter 2. ^ In order to minimize the effect of bond-torsions as in the above nitroxides and weaken the through-bond exchange coupling, so that the through-space exchange coupling mechanism remains significant, the 1, 3 -alternate calix[4]arene nitronylnitroxide diradical and tetraradical were synthesized and characterized (Chapter 3). ^ With the desire of exploring the biological applications of such diradicals and tetraradicals based on rigid scaffolds, a calix[4]arene nitroxide tetraradical with hexapoly(ethylene) glycol was synthesized (Chapter 4). The observation of good water solubility for the tetraradical (3 ̆e 50 mM) and the preliminary investigations of EPR properties, provide a foundation for a future synthesis of an octaradical on the same scaffold. ^ Lastly, our interest in exploring the applications of high-spin nitroxides in biological media led us to synthesize and characterize a glucamine-functionalized nitroxide diradical (Chapter 5). ...|$|R

In this thesis, we are presenting nano ruthenium oxide pyrochlore (Ru 2 Pb 2 O 7, Pyc) modified Nafion® membrane (designated as |NPyc|) catalyst for selective organic functional group transformations including oxidation of alcohols to aldehyde and ketone, amine to nitriles under ambient conditions. We are covering preparation, characterization by XRD, SEM, SECM, AFM, TGA, XAS and catalytic organic synthesis in triphasic medium with cooxidants such as H 2 O 2, NaOCl and O 2. Under optimal working condition, the membrane catalyst showed very good selectivity and good turnover for wide range of organic compounds. The |NPyc| catalyst can be recycled over > 100 times without any catalytic degradation. As to the mechanism, a high valent-oxo ruthenium redox species, perruthenate/ruthenate redox couple (Pyc-RuO 4 -/Pyc-RuO 42 -) exists in the |NPyc| believed to participate in the oxidation reaction with the <b>co-oxidants.</b> In continuation to the above studies, a novel ruthenium functionalized nickel hydroxide (designated as Ru/Ni(OH) 2) catalyst containing specific Ru-Ru and Ru-OHhydroxo bondings was prepared by simple solution phase procedures and characterized by XRD, IR, TGA, SEM, XPS and XAS (EXAFS and XANES). By using this as a new catalyst, series of alcohols were cleanly oxidized to corresponding aldehydes and ketones with higher turnover factors (~ 132 h- 1) than that of the literature reports, which were based on the monomeric Ru and Ru-Ru bonded catalysts. The Ru/Ni(OH) 2 can be recycled and reused without any leaching of metals. As to the mechanism, a low valent-hydroxo ruthenium species (Ru-OH) exists {{on the surface of the}} Ru/Ni(OH) 2 believed to participate in the aerobic alcohol oxidation reaction via a hydridometal pathway.

40|$|Hydroperoxide at α-position to the {{aromatic}} ring {{is the primary}} oxidation product formed. In all cases monoalkylbenzenes lead {{to the formation of}} benzoic acid. Oxidation in the presence of transition metal salts not only accelerate but also selectively decompose the hydroperoxides. Alkyl naphthalenes mainly produce the corresponding naphthalene carboxylic acids. Hock-rearrangement by the influence of strong acids converts the hydroperoxides to hemiacetals. Peresters formed from the hydroperoxides undergo Criegee rearrangement easily. Alkali metals accelerate the oxidation while CO 2 as <b>co-oxidant</b> enhances the selectivity. Microwave conditions give improved yields of the oxidation products...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} and {{characterization of}} several hexa – coordinated Ru(II) complexes {{of the type}} [Ru(CO) (B) (L) ] (B = PPh 3 /AsPh 3 /py/pip; L = di-basic tetradentate ligand derived from the condensation of isatin with diamines) were reported. IR, electronic, 1 H- NMR, 31 P-NMR of the complexes are discussed. An octahedral geometry has been tentatively proposed for all these complexes. The new complexes have been tested for the catalytic activity in the reaction of oxidation of alcohols {{in the presence of}} N-me- thylmorpholine–N-oxide as <b>co-oxidant.</b> The new complexes were also exhibited antimicrobial investigations...|$|E
