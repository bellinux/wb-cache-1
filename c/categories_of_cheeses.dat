The mean values of soluble nitrogen fraction on total nitrogen and trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen fraction on total nitrogen did not differ significantly between the different cheese varieties, with mean values of 16. 03 % and 9. 97 %, respectively.

40|$|Research has {{indicated}} that Brazilian cheeses have high salt content, which {{can be seen as}} a public health problem due to the large consumption of these products by the population.
