The conversion efficiency of biomass in developing countries in many cases is low resulting in unsustainable use of biomass resources and negative environmental impacts. In the earthen charcoal-making kiln widely used in the developing countries, the conversion efficiency is on average as low as 6 - 10 percent on dry basis. The low conversion efficiency {{is a source of}} greenhouse gas causing deforestation around most African cities. However, the earthen charcoal-making kiln has been reported to have potential for improvement of the kiln conversion efficiency.

40|$|Objectives. On {{the basis}} of the experimental, {{theoretical}} and field studies, an engineering calculation method was developed for assessing the cracking resistance of external enclosing constructions made of cellular concrete, with the maximum gradient development of moisture and carbonisation forced deformations along their thickness, taking into account the relaxation of the shrinkage stresses. In this regard, the aim of the work is to provide technological measures at the manufacturing stage in order to increase the operational cracking resistance of the construction's outer surface layers by reducing the moisture and carbonation shrinkage of cellular concrete by introducing a large or fine porous aggregate in calculated amounts. Methods. A number of analytical equations were applied to establish the dependence of the shrinkage of heavy concrete of conventional hardness on the amount of aggregate introduced and its elasticity modulus, water-cement ratio and cement consumption, as well as the concrete's moisture content. Results. Knowing the volumes of the structural aggregate and the cellular concrete mass, as well as their modulus of elasticity, the shrinkage reduction factor of the cellular concrete was calculated {{with the addition of a}} lightweight porous aggregate. Subsequently, the shrinkage deformations of concrete in the surface layer of the outer enclosing construction, maximising crack resistance due to moisture exchange and carbonation influences under operating conditions, were defined, taking into account the relaxation of tensile stresses due to creep of concrete. Conclusion. Theoretical calculations, based on the recommended method of assessing the cracking resistance of cellular concrete enclosing constructions under moisture exchange and <b>carbonisation</b> <b>processes,</b> taking into account the relaxation of shrinkage stresses, showed that in order to exclude the appearance of cracks in wall panels 280 mm thick made of 700 kg/m 3 gas ash concrete with elasticity modulus of 2500 MPa, it is necessary to have 70 - 80 % of keramzite or granulated slag, and 50 - 60 % of stone crumb (granite or marble crushed stone) of the volume of cellular concrete in the surface layer of 30 - 50 mm.  </p...|$|R

The aims of this research project were to identify and classify the binder-filler interfaces formed in carbon electrodes and {{to determine the effects}} of the interfacial quality on important electrode properties. The effects of raw materials and some fabrication process variables on interfacial characteristics and quality of laboratory produced test electrodes were also studied, and the development of binder-filler interfaces during the <b>carbonisation</b> <b>process</b> followed. Electrode quality was assessed by measurement of density, electrical resistivity and tensile strength. Pore structural data were also obtained by using a computerised image analysis system allied to an optical microscope. Interface quality data were obtained by examining etched surfaces in a scanning electron microscope and classifying the binder-filler interface observed into one of five categories. The category depending on the extent of contact between the binder and filler. Accordingly, test electrodes were produced from combinations of four filler carbons, comprising three grades of calcined petroleum coke and an electro-calcined anthracite, and four coal-tar binder pitches which varied in the type and quantity of insoluble matter content. Examination of these test electrodes showed that the nature of the filler carbon used had a dominant influence on the quality of the interface formed, as assessed by this technique. A combination of one filler carbon and one binder pitch was used to study the effects of some fabrication process variables. These were pitch content and, mixing time and temperature. Of these process variables, pitch content and mixing temperature were found to have the major effects on the binder-filler interface and electrode quality. Investigation of the development of the binder-filler interfaces during the <b>carbonisation</b> <b>process</b> showed three distinct zones of interface development and transformation.

Macroscopic properties of black ceramics strongly depend {{on the quality of the}} interfaces between grains of solid filler (graphite, carbon black) and coke originating from the pyrolysis of the binder; thus, the binder should correctly wet the filler prior to the <b>carbonisation</b> <b>process.</b> Coal-tar pitch usually exhibits a high affinity for carbon grains. In the present work, the effect of the amount of sulphur on the viscosity of the molten binder and on the way it wets the solid filler was investigated. For that purpose, the penetration of mixtures of coal-tar pitch and sulphur inside a bed of carbon particles was studied as a function of temperature. The influence of the sulphur content on composition, optical texture, and transport properties of the derived black ceramics, as well as the way it was mixed with the other constituents, were also examined. It was found that the preparation of black ceramics may be achieved easily and in safe conditions, without evolution of H 2 S, using pitch–sulphur mixtures first molten in a bladed mixer, and having sulphur contents within the range 10 – 20 wt. %. The presence of sulphur increases the coke yield but lowers the ability to graphitise, thus limiting the transport properties of the resultant black ceramic. The optimal concentration of sulphur should thus be a compromise between mechanical strength and other physical properties...|$|E

The paper presents analysis of the high-pressure gas quenching of metal elements, after their vacuum <b>carbonisation</b> <b>process,</b> based on the computer simulation. The ANSYS-CFX code {{has been used for}} this purpose. This transient quenching process includes challenging problems, which requires deep knowledge and application of heat transfer, fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. The numerical simulation analysis method focuses on a single element contained in an elementary, repeatable section (usually a cuboid) of the whole batch. In this study quenching of a steel cylinder of diameter d = 20 mm and length L = 150 mm is analysed. This approach allows defining precisely: (i) the geometries of the metal element and of the elementary cubical section associated with it and, also, (ii) flow and thermal boundary conditions on the walls of this elementary section. Above definition of the elementary section (a computing domain) allows using the whole available computing power for the quenching process simulation in it. The ratio of volumes mentioned in (i) defines a “porosity of batch” and the analysis covers the range from 7 to 70 %. The number of grid points used for the elementary section varies from 55000 to 240000. The influence of the pressure gradient value (a flow “driving force” through the elementary section) and its direction – on temperature and quenching rate time distributions in a steel element – is analysed and presented. The use of periodicity and symmetry conditions, for the velocity field, on the elementary section walls, allows simulating different single element quenching conditions – reflecting its position in the batch. The transient quenching has been usually analysed for a fixed velocity field. However, the steel element body thermal properties in this transient process varied – appropriately to its time dependent temperature distribution. The initial element temperature is assumed to be equal 1300 K. The influence of different gases, i. e. argon, helium, nitrogen and hydrogen, and their static pressures (up to 30 bar), on the steel element quenching process, is analysed and presented. cs 201...|$|E

The effects on the operating temperature, time and amount of water usage on the yield and carbon conversion for both materials were examined. A purpose built pressure vessel was designed, with the capacity to be operated up to 230 °C and 30 bars. In addition, a program was constructed by using Lab VIEW software to control and record the operation. The characteristics of the biocarbon from EFB and WC were carried out through elemental, calorific, SEM, FTlR, pyconometer and RGB colour model, to examine the correspondence of the biocarbon characteristics with the operating conditions. The HTC process converts the EFB and WC into higher percentage of carbon content solid products. Based on these analyses, the increment of the operating temperature offer more improvement on the biocarbon quality compared to the residence time. The carbon conversion of EFB's biocarbon (operated at 220 °C for 22 hours) increased for 20 % compared to the raw EFB (43. 8 % of carbon). In addition, the calorific value of EFB's Abstract biocarbon increased from 17. 7 to 28. 2 Ml/kg, which is nearly similar with the value of lignite (26. 8 MJlkg). A kinetic calculation of the process was calculated by combining the shrinking core model (SCM) and Arrhenius equation. The rate constant for both EFB and WC varies from 0. 044 to 0. 1 04 s·l. Also, comparison on the economic calculation for direct combustion of EFB materials before and after the conversion process was carried out. Based on this calculation, it can be stated that the combustion process is not profitable for the HTC process' biocarbon because this process require quite a lot of energy. The usage of the biocarbon as plantation area was verified by using these products as soil conditioner in the radish growth starts and substrates in mushroom cultivation process. Finally, it can be conclude that the HTC process is practicable method to convert biomass into value added material. In future, improvement of the methodology such as an addition of catalyst in the process and agitator to the rig can be done to obtain higher yield. Also, depth investigations on the biocarbon behaviour in soil medium and effect on the growth and quality of plant is suggested. 11 EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} this {{research}} is to study the use of ultrasonication, using a probe sonicator to produce short fibre from electrospun webs of four types of polymer poly(styrene) (PS), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN) and poly(L-lactic) acid (PLLA). Scissioning of the usually long, continuous non-woven electrospun web would be useful as a means to produce short discrete fibres in significant amounts. Such materials are useful for numerous applications, including composite reinforcement and biomedical applications such as vessels for the containment and release of drugs. Optimisation of the electrospinning parameters were carried out to produce electrospun fibres from the four polymers that were beads-free, and whose nanofiber constituents had submicron diameters. It was found by producing and testing non-woven webs that had roughly similar fibre diameters, as well as similar tensile strength and elastic modulus, that the ductility of the electrospun polymer was the key determinant as to whether the web could be ultrasonically scissioned. Thus, ultrasonication is an effective method to scission brittle/submicron electrospun fibre such as PS and PMMA, whilst post-treatments such as UV-Ozone irradiation and heat treatment of the electrospun fibres were required for polymers such as PAN and PLLA. Without such post-treatment, PAN and PLLA were unable to be scissioned, regardless for how long the samples were sonicated. The success of the post-treatments was due to either reductions in ductility reduction or induced flaws on the electrospun fibres, the latter acting as points for the initiation of failure, facilitating the scissioning of these more ductile materials. The potential mechanisms involved in scissioning were also investigated and discussed, and relate to bubble cavitation and collapse caused by the ultrasonication probe. These mechanism ranged from the effect {{of the impact of the}} jet resulting from imploding bubbles leading to erosion and pitting which would create point of weakness for crack initiation, to fibre buckling for long fibres that were oriented parallel to the bubble surface during bubble growth, leading to rotation and buckling of the fibres when the bubble collapsed. The shorter fibres that align normal to the bubble surface experience a difference in velocity for both fibre ends when the bubble implodes. The highest velocity at the end nearest to the bubble wall compared to the farthest end thus leads to tensile failure. The effects of the sonication parameters on the scission process were investigated and it was found that the sonication parameter such as run time, lapsed time, amplitude and solvent types affects the scission efficiency, with the bulk temperature of the solvent and the concentration of dissolved gas in the solvent showing no effect on the short fibre length. The effects of scissioning electrospun PAN prior to and after <b>carbonisation</b> <b>process</b> were also investigated. It was found that the scissioned-carbonised (as-spun web was sonicated prior to carbonisation) showed no significant difference in terms of the surface morphology, carbonaceous quality and electrical conductivity compared with the carbonised-scissioned (the as-spun web was carbonised followed by sonication scissioned). Methods of composite preparation for carbonised PAN short fibre/epoxy were investigated and it was found that the solvent blending method was superior to prepare the composite compared with a high speed mixing technique and no solvent, with some improvement on the flexural strength and modulus observed for the scissioned-carbonised/epoxy compared with the carbonised-scissioned/epoxy composite and the epoxy resin alone...|$|E
