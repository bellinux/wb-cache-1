5|$|One of the cruiser's early {{commanding}} officers, Royal Navy Captain J.W.A. Waller, {{believed that}} the ship's single director <b>control</b> <b>tower</b> was a weak point in the design. The director <b>control</b> <b>tower</b> was the highest compartment on the ship, from where personnel would determine the range and optimum firing angle for a gun salvo, then transmit this information to the gun turrets: the actual firing could be controlled from the tower or the turret. Waller {{believed that the}} centralised system could be destroyed with a single hit, or the wiring linking the compartment to the turrets could be severed, forcing the four turrets to rely on independent control. Although Waller suggested that a second tower be installed aft to provide redundancy, it was deferred indefinitely as subsequent commanding officers did not share his concerns, and combat experiences of other Leander-class cruisers showed that the system was more robust than expected.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads of}} the art department, Bob Bell and Keith Wilson, divided their efforts so that Bell contributed mostly to the film and Wilson to the Series Two episodes. Sets {{constructed}} by Bell especially for Thunderbirds Are Go included the Glenn Field <b>Control</b> <b>Tower</b> and Press Conference Room, the interiors of The Swinging Star, and re-designed versions of various locations on Tracy Island.|$|E

5|$|The torpedoes {{initially}} had {{a similar}} system where various rangefinders, especially the fifteen-foot rangefinder above the aft torpedo <b>control</b> <b>tower,</b> and deflection sights provided data to a Dreyer table in the torpedo TS adjacent to the 5.5-inch TS on the lower deck. However the Dreyer table was removed during Hoods 1929–1931 refit and the calculations {{were made in the}} torpedo control position in the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The town {{is home to}} the Plymouth Municipal Airport, {{which lies}} on the border between Plymouth and Carver. Founded in 1931, it offers {{scheduled}} service to Nantucket, as well as private service. The airport features a local restaurant and gift shop, but does not have an on-site traffic <b>control</b> <b>tower.</b>|$|E
5|$|To further {{add to his}} confusion, he {{encountered}} a series of islands north of Abaco Island, which looks {{very similar to the}} Key West Islands. The <b>control</b> <b>tower</b> then suggested that Taylor's team should fly west, which would have taken them to the landmass of Florida eventually. Taylor headed for what he thought was west, but in reality was northwest, almost parallel to Florida.|$|E

5|$|With {{a history}} {{stretching}} {{to the time}} following World War I, Roanoke Regional Airport has evolved {{from a pair of}} dirt runways and a single hangar to a fully equipped, modern airport serving multiple commercial airlines. Today the airport features a terminal building completed in 1989, a pair of asphalt runways, and a <b>control</b> <b>tower</b> completed in 2005 that serves the residents of the greater Roanoke Valley.|$|E
5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the <b>control</b> <b>tower.</b> Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The <b>control</b> <b>tower</b> informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland Hopkins International Airport is the city's major {{airport and}} an {{international}} airport that formerly served as a main hub for United Airlines. It holds the distinction of having the first airport-to-downtown rapid transit connection in North America, established in 1968. In 1930, the airport {{was the site of}} the first airfield lighting system and the first air traffic <b>control</b> <b>tower.</b> Originally known as Cleveland Municipal Airport, it was the first municipally owned airport in the country. Cleveland Hopkins is a significant regional air freight hub hosting FedEx Express, UPS Airlines, United States Postal Service, and major commercial freight carriers.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Loring's bombers {{were placed}} on alert after Soviet {{submarines}} were spotted {{off the coast of}} the region. The base was briefly mentioned in the 1983 movie WarGames, although the film erroneously listed Loring as being home to the 43rd Bombardment Wing. In 1982, the base was hit by two earthquakes, which damaged the base hospital and caused cracks to appear {{on the walls of the}} <b>control</b> <b>tower.</b>|$|E
5|$|In October 2004, a {{contract}} was signed with Haugesund-based Coast Air, who would operate Jetstream 31 aircraft between Skien and Bergen. The owner of Coast Air, Kystfly, also bought 20% of Vildanden. Coast Air had previously operated routes from Skien to Western Norway, but had withdrawn in 1999. Following the announcement from Vildanden and Coast Air, the municipality {{decided to not}} close the airport, and cover the estimated NOK300,000 annual deficit, as well as upgrade the <b>control</b> <b>tower</b> for NOK700,000. The airport had been closed since 2002, following the increased domestic and international traffic from near-by Sandefjord Airport, Torp.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the onsite <b>control</b> <b>tower,</b> the airport is home to Melbourne Centre, an air traffic control facility {{that is responsible for}} the separation of aircraft in Australia's busiest flight information region, Melbourne FIR. Melbourne FIR monitors airspace over Victoria, Tasmania, southern New South Wales, most of South Australia, the southern half of Western Australia and airspace over the Indian and Southern Ocean. In total, the centre controls 6% of the world's airspace. The airport is also the home of the Canberra approach and Melbourne approach facilities, which provide control services to aircraft arriving and departing at those airports.|$|E

5|$|On 23 May, a $17 million {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} two companies, to complete {{the first phase of}} construction. This included the north−south runway, a parallel taxiway (Taxiway J), a parking apron, the Arch Hangar, a base operations building, a <b>control</b> <b>tower,</b> a power plant, a 250-person barracks (which would later become Building 6000), a water supply system, and a railroad spur to the base (now part of the Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway).|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} earthquake, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ordered a ground stop along the East Coast, causing some flight delays. The Air Traffic <b>Control</b> <b>tower</b> at John F. Kennedy International Airport was evacuated. Flights were delayed at several airports, {{including}} John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Dulles International Airport, and Philadelphia International Airport. At Ronald Reagan National Airport, ceiling tiles fell in one terminal, and flights were halted.|$|E
5|$|The B-52 aircraft, callsign Czar 52, {{took off}} at 13:58 and {{completed}} {{most of the}} mission's elements without incident. Upon preparing to execute the touch-and-go on Runway 23 {{at the end of}} the practice profile, the aircraft was instructed to go around because a KC-135 aircraft had just landed and was on the runway. Maintaining an altitude of about 250 feet (75m) above ground level (AGL), Holland radioed the <b>control</b> <b>tower</b> and asked for permission to execute a 360° left turn, which was immediately granted by the tower controller.|$|E
