40|$|Climate {{change and}} {{anthropogenic}} factors can alter biodiversity {{and can lead}} to changes in community structure and function. Despite the potential impacts, no long-term records of climatic influences on microbial communities exist. The Tibetan Plateau is a highly sensitive region that is currently undergoing significant alteration resulting from both climate change and increased human activity. Ice cores from glaciers in this region serve as unique natural archives of bacterial abundance and community composition, and contain concomitant records of climate and environmental change. We report high-resolution profiles of bacterial density and community composition over the past half century in ice cores from three glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau. Statistical analysis showed that the bacterial community composition in the three ice cores converged starting in the 1990 s. Changes in bacterial community composition were related to changing precipitation, increasing air temperature and anthropogenic activities {{in the vicinity of the}} plateau. Collectively, our ice core data on bacteria in concert with environmental and anthropogenic proxies indicate that the convergence of bacterial <b>communities</b> <b>deposited</b> on glaciers across a wide geographical area and situated in diverse habitat types was likely induced by climatic and anthropogenic drivers...|$|R

40|$|Because {{less than}} one-third of {{clinically}} relevant fusaria can be accurately identified to species level using phenotypic data (i. e., morphological species recognition), we constructed a three-locus DNA sequence database to facilitate molecular identification of the 69 Fusarium species associated with human or animal mycoses encountered in clinical microbiology laboratories. The database comprises partial sequences from three nuclear genes: translation elongation factor 1 {alpha} (EF- 1 {alpha}), the largest subunit of RNA polymerase (RPB 1), and the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase (RPB 2). These three gene fragments can be amplified by PCR and sequenced using primers that are conserved across the phylogenetic breadth of Fusarium. Phylogenetic analyses of the combined data set reveal that, {{with the exception of}} two monotypic lineages, all clinically relevant fusaria are nested in one of eight variously sized and strongly supported species complexes. The monophyletic lineages have been named informally to facilitate communication of an isolate's clade membership and genetic diversity. To identify isolates to the species included within the database, partial DNA sequence data from {{one or more of the}} three genes can be used as a BLAST query against the database which is Web accessible at FUSARIUM-ID ([URL] and the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS-KNAW) Fungal Biodiversity Center ([URL] Alternatively, isolates can be identified via phylogenetic analysis by adding sequences of unknowns to the DNA sequence alignment, which can be downloaded from the two aforementioned websites.

In this study, bacterial and fungal communities on 9 - and 11 -year-old volcanic deposits at poorly to fully vegetation-recovered sites in Miyake-jima, Japan, were characterized by con-ventional culture-based methods and pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA and 18 S rRNA genes. Despite the differences in the vege-tation cover, the upper volcanic deposit layer samples displayed low among-site variation for chemical properties (pH, total organic carbon, and total nitrogen) and microbial population densities (total direct count and culturable count). Statistical analyses of pyrosequencing data revealed that the microbial <b>communities</b> of volcanic <b>deposit</b> samples were phylogenetically diverse, in spite of very low-carbon environmental conditions, and their diversity was comparable to that in the lower soil layer (buried soil) samples.

40|$|Presented at the American Library Association, June 27, 2015. San Fransisco CaliforniaLibraries that {{maintain}} an institutional repository (IR) have always faced issues of metadata quality. The University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) Library is no exception. The issue of metadata quality at UHM {{is complicated by}} several factors: 1) metadata is produced by the IR’s community members and often not trained by library staff through unmediated submissions; 2) the repository’s scope is inclusive of both scholarly and non-scholarly works produced on campus; 3) the <b>community</b> that <b>deposits</b> digital objects to the IR consists of diverse members; 4) the IR has been up and running for seven years with no formal/documented workflows and/or metadata guidelines. Based on the understanding that standardization of metadata practice alone cannot achieve the goal, UHM has taken a holistic and versatile approach {{to improve the quality}} of metadata in its IR. In other words, a preset basic course of actions, ranging from standardization to outreach, has been adjusted based on contingencies and feedback. This method has worked well not only because it enables good quality metadata to be an integral part of the UHM’s IR initiative as a whole, but also because it has helped make a positive impact on open access that UHM advocates and beyond. The poster illustrates the approach undertaken to show how each action aligns with the overarching goal of improving metadata, and is intertwined each other to contribute to some of the Library’s larger objectives...|$|R
40|$|Ancient {{thermal spring}} sites have several {{features}} which make them significant targets {{in a search}} for past life. Chemical (including redox) reactions in hydrothermal systems possibly {{played a role in the}} origin of life on Earth and elsewhere. Spring waters frequently contain reduced species (sulfur compounds, Fe(sup + 2), etc.) which can provide chemical energy for organic synthesis. Relatively cool hydrothermal systems can sustain abundant microbial life (on Earth, at temperatures greater than 110 C). A spring site on Mars perhaps might even have maintained liquid water for periods sufficiently long to sustain surface-dwelling biota had they existed. On Earth, a variety of microbial mat communities can be sampled along the wide range of temperatures surrounding the spring, thus offering an opportunity to sample a broad biological diversity. Thermal spring waters frequently deposit minerals (carbonates, silica, etc.) which can entomb and preserve both fluid inclusions and microbial <b>communities.</b> These <b>deposits</b> can be highly fossiliferous and preserve biological inclusions for geologically long periods of time. Such deposits can cover several square km on Earth, and their distinctive mineralogy (e. g., silica- and/or carbonate-rich) can contrast sharply with that of the surrounding region. As with Martian volcanoes, Martian thermal spring complexes and their deposits might typically be much larger than their counterparts on Earth. Thus Martian spring deposits are perhaps readily detectable and even accessible. Elysium Planitia is an example of a promising region where hydrothermal activity very likely remobilized ground ice and sustained springs...|$|R

We investigated the effects of cattle access on macroinvertebrate <b>communities</b> and <b>deposited</b> fine sediment levels, in four rivers of high/good and four rivers of moderate water quality status which drain, low gradient, calcareous grassland catchments in Ireland. We assessed the temporal variability in macroinvertebrates communities across two seasons, spring and autumn. Site specific impacts were evident which appeared to be influenced by water quality status and season. All four high/good water status rivers revealed significant downstream changes in community structure and at least two univariate metrics (total richness and EPT richness together with taxon, E and EPT abundance). Two of the four moderate water status rivers showed significant changes in community structure, abundance and richness metrics and functional feeding groups driven in the main by downstream increases in collectors/gatherers, shredders and burrowing taxa. These two moderate water status rivers had high or prolonged livestock activity. In view of these findings, the potential for some of these sites to achieve at least high/good water quality status, as set out in the EU Water Framework Directive, may be compromised. The results presented highlight the need for additional research to further define the site specific factors and livestock management practices, under different discharge conditions, that increase the risk of impact on aquatic ecology due to these cattle-river interactions...|$|R
30|$|Silicon is {{the most}} common element of the Earth’s surface after oxygen; this element is {{released}} into the soil by chemical and biological processes [1]. Industrially speaking, silicon is the basis of semiconductors, glasses, ceramics, plastics, elastomers, resins, mesoporous molecular sieves and catalysts, optical fibers and coatings, insulators, moisture shields, photoluminescent polymers, fillers, cosmetics and biomedical devices [2, 3], among many other applications. The manufacture of these materials typically requires high temperatures, high pressure and/or the use of caustic chemicals [4]. In contrast, in nature, silica architectures with delicate morphologies are generated under ambient conditions [5]. Unicellular organisms, such as diatoms, use structuring and templating biomolecules to produce silica shells that not only contain hierarchically ordered porous structures, with dimensions ranging from the nanometer to the micrometer domain, but also possess remarkable mechanical and structural properties [6 – 8]. Other approach involves the use Fosuarium oxysporum, a plant pathogenic fungus for the biotransformation of naturally occurring amorphous plant bio-silica into quasi-spherical crystalline silica nanoparticles and its extracellular leaching in the aqueous environment at room temperature [9]. An analysis suggested that extreme thermophilic bacteria within the genera thermus and hydrogenobacter are predominant components among the indigenous microbial <b>community</b> in siliceous <b>deposits.</b> These bacteria seem to actively contribute to the rapid formation of huge siliceous deposits [10].|$|R
