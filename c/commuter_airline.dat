25|$|Another <b>commuter</b> <b>airline</b> in the U.S., Rocky Mountain Airways, {{operated}} Twin Otters {{from the}} Lake County Airport in Leadville, CO. At {{an elevation of}} 9,927 feet above mean sea level, this airport is the highest airfield in the U.S. ever to have received scheduled passenger airline service, thus demonstrating the wide-ranging flight capabilities of the Twin Otter. Rocky Mountain Airways {{went on to become}} the worldwide launch customer for the larger, four-engine de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 STOL turboprop, but continued to operate the Twin Otter, as well.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Britten-Norman {{was formed}} {{for the purpose}} of {{converting}} and operating agricultural aircraft, amongst other vehicles such as the Cushioncraft hovercraft. In 1963, the firm initiated development work upon what would become the Islander, having sensed a demand for a single and inexpensive twin-piston engine aircraft. The founders, John Britten and Desmond Norman, had observed the rapid growth of the <b>commuter</b> <b>airline</b> sector, and concluded that capacity was of a higher value to these operators than either range or cruising speed, thus the Islander emphasized payload over either of these attributes.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{the airport}} is served by Air New Zealand's {{regional}} subsidiaries with flights to Auckland, Wellington, Queenstown and Christchurch and <b>commuter</b> <b>airline</b> Sunair with flights to Gisborne and the North Shore.

25|$|After {{the success}} of the EMB 110 Bandeirante, Embraer began the {{development}} of their first transport category airliner in 1974. The Family 12X comprised three models with modular concept designs: EMB 120 Araguaia, EMB 123 Tapajós and EMB 121 Xingu. EMB 121 was the sole 12X model effectively produced. Araguaia's name was changed to Brasilia in 1979 at the official launching of the project, when at a CAAA (<b>Commuter</b> <b>Airline</b> Association of America) convention at USA several suggestions from prospective operators were collected and incorporated to EMB 120 design. Thus, a completely new aircraft – no longer related to the 12X family – was launched. No common parts from EMB 121 Xingu were used, and the capacity was revised from 24 to 30 seats. Originally designed to utilise the new 1500 shp Pratt & Whitney Canada PW115 turboprop, it was later upgraded to the 1892 eshp PW118.|$|E
