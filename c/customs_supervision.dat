According to officials, offenders were not required to register for various reasons, such as the offense not requiring registration in some states. Of the 6 offenders in GAO's sample that should have registered, officials from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ICE-ERO) field offices informed 4 of their registration requirements. However, officials at some of these field offices identified several reasons why they did not ensure that these offenders actually registered. For example, the offender may have moved and no longer resided in the area of responsibility for that particular field office. ICE had not informed the remaining 2 offenders of their registration requirements. ...|$|R

Nastupajući svakodnevno kao svjedok, istražitelj i sudac, emin je rješavao najrazličitije vrste sporova u samom začetku i olakšavao sklapanje raznoraznih poslova između osmanskih i dubrovačkih podanika.

This paper presents a performance analysis for planning a logistics operation system in a free-trade port area when a port is reformed from a traditional operation area to a free-trade port area. First, the new operation process of the system, including <b>customs</b> <b>supervision</b> operation at checkposts, the logistics operation process at container terminals and container yards, and the transport operation of trucks through the transport networks is analyzed. Then, the performance analysis model for the dynamic behaviour of the system is presented, especially the logistics process cycle of the container trucks between the outbound container yards and the inbound container terminals. Because of the complexity of the system activity, a simulation model has been adopted using discrete event system simulation to realize the system performance analysis method. Finally, an actual case in China is used to verify the performance analysis model, to analyze the operation performance, and to find the bottlenecks of the system operation according to the simulation results. According to the analysis results of the system operation performance, an improved planning scheme is proposed...|$|E
