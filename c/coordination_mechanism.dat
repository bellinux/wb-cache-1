While supply chain analysis focuses on vertical and network analysis on horizontal inderdependencies across companies, netchain analysis incorporates both type of interdependencies into one concept. Netchain analysis emphasizes value creation and <b>coordination</b> <b>mechanism</b> sources corresponding to different kind of interdependencies.

40|$|In {{response}} to the increasing need to balance the pressures of global integration and local responsiveness, foreign subsidiaries must play {{a prominent role in}} the creation of knowledge that is valuable to the MNE as a whole. In this context, a key managerial problem relates to the balance between <b>coordination</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and knowledge flows from the subsidiary to the parent company, known as reverse knowledge transfer. It is crucial to understand the interdependencies between subsidiary roles and key <b>coordination</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> such as subsidiary autonomy, personal and electronic-based <b>coordination</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This paper, therefore, offers new insights into the impact of <b>coordination</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on reverse knowledge transfer. On the basis of a data set consisting of 280 dyads between foreign subsidiaries and their parent companies, two distinctive configurations are found to positively affect the extent of reverse knowledge transfer. The first is the combination of a high degree of subsidiary autonomy and greater use of personal <b>coordination</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> and the second is the combination of low subsidiary autonomy and greater use of electronic-based <b>coordination</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> However, the relevance of these coordination configurations differs for various subsidiary roles.

We identify some difficulties that arise when geographically distributed teams organize joint activities by groupware tools, and we look at how various forms of <b>coordination</b> <b>mechanisms</b> address these issues. Our findings indicate that students coordinate many of their activities by informal, locally adopted resources instead of fully developed <b>coordination</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> To explain this form of behaviour we see coordination as an aspect of inter-subjectivity, and we define inter-subjectivity as a reciprocal relationship of coordination, collaboration and interaction.

The set of <b>coordination</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is evaluated by applying it in an interpretive case study of a house building firm and confronting the set of mechanisms with other theories of coordination. The result of the evaluation shows that the applied set of <b>coordination</b> <b>mechanisms</b> does not sufficiently cover important aspects of organizational coordination and information system use, such as more dynamic issues (e. g. coordination history, external influence, emergent processes, concurrency and variation, and communication). The set of <b>coordination</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is, however, more sufficient when it comes to understanding formal division of labour, stable organizational structures and roles, and planned coordination...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between <b>coordination</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and typologies of knowledge in a wine firm. Allocating knowledge as either process related or outcome related, we illustrate the nature of knowledge that emerges in each category and discuss the main <b>coordination</b> <b>mechanisms</b> used to integrate knowledge. We used a single case study, as this approach was considered best for gaining an in-depth, holistic understanding of the phenomenon. We studied an Italian wine firm, positioning the analysis within the theoretical background on knowledge governance. Unlike previous studies on the wine industry, which focused on the network level, we tried to study the organization, focusing on how {{the adoption of the}} <b>coordination</b> <b>mechanisms</b> influences tacit and explicit knowledge integration. The study shows how both tacit and explicit knowledge {{play a key role in}} managing processes. We found that it was not possible to define a clear and fixed association between typical situations and the adoption of <b>coordination</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Interpreting our findings in a dynamic perspective, we found that it is the combination of different <b>coordination</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that is important in integrating knowledge.
