40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} <b>of</b> aquatic <b>reed</b> {{stands at}} Lake Ammersee was documented by using vertical airborne photographs which were taken during four partial and five complete flights beginning in 1944. A dramatic decline <b>of</b> <b>reed,</b> especially <b>of</b> those parts which stood in deep water, was demonstrated. Between the years 1963 and 1969 60 % and until 1992 another 30 % of the Phragmitetum disappeared. Only {{at the east}} bank did the lake reed beds slightly expand. The examination of possible factors affecting the development <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> at Lake Ammersee lead to the following scenario: Until 1940 reed stands at Lake Ammersee spread and covered large aquatic areas. Only the east bank of the lake, where the influence of wind and waves was high, and banks near towns and recreation areas remained uncovered. Since the regulation of the River Ammer between 1920 and 1938 flood occurrence increased enormously. The flood disaster of the year 1965 coincided with {{the period of the}} highest rate <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> decline. The peak of eutrophication in the lake was reached in 1975. Huge carpets of green algae caused further retreat <b>of</b> <b>reeds.</b> At the present time recovery is not possible because of the negative influence of human recreation and <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> consuming waterfowl. Interestingly enough an expansion <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> has been observed at the east bank of Lake Ammersee at places were there was no Phragmites previously...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBased on {{the results}} of existed {{research}} about environmental-flow <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> communities in Baiyangdian Lake, the Li- 6400 portable photosynthesis system was used to record the transpiration rate <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> (Phragmites australis var. baiyangdiasis) leaves under different meteorological conditions. Leaf Area Index (LAI) <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> communities, evaporation rate of open water surface and meteorological conditions were also recorded. Meteorological conditions were divided into sunny, un-sunny (cloudy, overcast) and rainy days, the transpiration rate in rainy days was regarded as 0. Environmental-flow <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> community in different months was calculated according to the transpiration and evaporation. Results show that the environmental-flow differed significantly among different meteorological conditions. In particular, the environmental-flow in sunny condition was 1. 58 times of un-sunny conditions on average. Under given meteorological conditions, the environmental-flows <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> communities in the Baiyangdian Lake during June to September in 2006 were 0. 19 × 108, 0. 25 × 108, 0. 38 × 108, and 0. 18 × 108 m 3, The actual environmental-flows <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> communities in Baiyangdian Lake from June to September were 2. 25, 2. 08, 3. 17 and 2. 57 times of the estimated values.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the use <b>of</b> delayed harvested <b>reed</b> canary-grass (Phalaris arundinacea) as a short fibre {{raw material for}} the pulp and paper industry. This study examines the following aspects <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> canary-grass: quality, transportation, storage, refining of the raw material by dry fractionation, chemical pulping, bleaching and paper production. The delayed harvesting method <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> canary-grass produces an economically and environmentally sustainable short fibre raw material for the pulp and paper industry. The ash content and fibre properties <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> canary-grass depend on soil type and growing location. The yearly variation in fibre yield and fibre properties is also considerable. There is, however, a potential for minimising quality variations by choosing reed canary-grass varieties suitable to a specific growing location. The leaf and leaf sheath content <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> canary-grass also affects {{the quality of the}} pulp. These quality variations can be eliminated by dry fractionation, a method that removes the unwanted parts of the grass. These unwanted parts {{can be used as a}} valuable bio-fuel raw material. Transport <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> canary grass after fractionation can be improved by briquetting, a method that doubles the transport capacity <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> canary-grass compared to that of birch logs on a fibre basis. High quality short fibre chemical pulp can be produced from reed canary-grass. The whole process from grass production to pulp production has been demonstrated successfully in full scale. Bleached reed canary-grass pulp can be used in products such as fine paper and white-top liner paper...|$|R

The Marathon variety <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> canarygrass was studied with two sowing periods and four N-fertilizer rate applications.

The samples <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> canarygrass taken in April had a greater concentration of As, Cd, Pb, which means that the plants absorb the heavy metals also from the snow covering. The first year yield <b>of</b> <b>reed</b> canarygrass established a fundamental negative correlation between the amount of As, Cd, Pb and the ash content.
