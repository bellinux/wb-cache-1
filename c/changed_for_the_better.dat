5|$|Gordon Brown was {{reportedly}} unhappy over Blair's comments about him, while David Runciman of The London Review of Books suggested there were episodes from Blair's troubled {{relationship with his}} Chancellor that were absent from A Journey. Labour politician Alistair Darling said the book demonstrates how the country can be <b>changed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> when a government has a clear purpose, while the New Zealand Listener suggested Blair and his contemporaries had helped to write New Labour's epitaph. Some families of servicemen {{and women who were}} killed in Iraq reacted angrily, with one antiwar commentator dismissing Blair's regrets over the loss of life. Shortly after the release of A Journey, the screenwriter of the 2006 film The Queen, which depicts Blair's first months in office, accused Blair of plagiarising a conversation with Elizabeth II from him.|$|E
5|$|In Bulgaria, the {{two decades}} {{following}} the end of the rebellion marked the lowest point of decline of the Second Empire. The reigns of George Terter I (r. 1280–1292) and his successor Smilets (r. 1292–1298) were characterised with constant Mongol interference in the state's domestic affairs and progressive disintegration of Imperial authority in favour of the feudal magnates. Bulgaria had lost almost all lands to the south of the Balkan mountains to the Byzantines and was in no position to regain these regions. The fortunes of the country <b>changed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> under George Terter I's son, Theordore Svetoslav (r. 1300–1321), when Bulgaria acquired Bessarabia from the Mongols and reconquered Northern Thrace from the Byzantines, bringing stability and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1991 season, Zerex {{ended their}} {{sponsorship}} of Kulwicki's team. Junior Johnson came calling again, {{looking for a}} driver for his revived second team that had last seen Neil Bonnett behind the wheel in 1986. Kulwicki turned down Johnson's $1 million offer thinking that he had secured a sponsorship deal with Maxwell House Coffee. Johnson then went to Maxwell House himself and obtained the sponsorship for his new car, which Sterling Marlin was hired to drive instead. Kulwicki was forced to begin the season without a sponsor, paying all of the team's expenses {{out of his own}} pocket. At the opening race of the season, the 1991 Daytona 500, fivecars raced with paint schemes representing different branches of the United States military to show support for the American forces involved in the Gulf War. It was the first use of special paint schemes in NASCAR history. Kulwicki's car was sponsored by the United States Army in a one-race deal. After running the second and third races of the season in a plain white unsponsored car, Kulwicki's luck finding a sponsor <b>changed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> at Atlanta Motor Speedway.|$|E

5|$|The {{beginning}} of the match was dominated by St Johnstone and after 13 minutes they were awarded a penalty kick by referee Eddie Smith when Dunfermline midfielder Stephen Simmons collided with St Johnstone's Steven Anderson in the penalty area. Paul Sheerin took the penalty kick and scored beyond Dunfermline's goalkeeper, Paul Gallacher, by hitting {{the ball into the}} bottom-left corner of the goal to score his seventh penalty of the season. Just several minutes after the first goal St Johnstone had an opportunity to score again when Kenny Deuchar had an attempt on goal after a pass from Rocco Quinn; the header beat goalkeeper Gallacher but went just wide of the goalpost. In the 19th minute, however, St Johnstone did score their second goal when Peter MacDonald struck a left-footed volley from 12 yards out which Dunfermline's goalkeeper Gallacher failed to stop. St Johnstone's early dominance coupled with Dunfermline's poor defending resulted in St Johnstone scoring a third goal after only 30 minutes; forward Andy Jackson passed the ball to Derek McInnes who then played the ball to Deuchar who moved past defender Sol Bamba in the penalty area and scored past the opposing goalkeeper from eight yards out to make it 3–0. Four minutes after the third goal, Dunfermline manager Stephen Kenny made the first substitution of the match, replacing defender Calum Woods with Darren Young. In the 37th minute, shortly after the substitution, Dunfermline scored when Scott Wilson's header beat St Johnstone goalkeeper Alan Main. Dunfermline's form <b>changed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> after their first goal and they almost scored again just before half time when substitute Young's goal-attempt rebounded off the goalpost.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 4th and early 5th centuries, the work {{received}} a mixed response. Many scholars hold that the theologian, historian, and translator Jerome was {{a critic of}} the work; in a letter written from Bethlehem to Paulinus of Nola castigating Virgilian centos, he warned against following an [...] "old chatterbox" [...] (garrula anus) and those who think of calling [...] "the Christless Maro [...] a Christian" [...] (non ... Maronem sine Christo possimus dicere Christianum). According to the historian James Westfall Thompson, Jerome [...] "strongly inveighed against this method of destroying the sense of a pagan author", and this [...] "his love of the classics and his Christian piety were alike offended" [...] by Proba's actions. Conversely, [...] Roman Emperor Arcadius (who reigned from AD 395–408) received a copy of the poem, and his version has a fifteen-line dedication contending that Proba's work is [...] "Maro <b>changed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> in a sacred meaning” (Maronem mutatum in melius divino ... sensu). The work was also presented to Aelia Eudocia, the wife of Emperor Theodosius II (who reigned from AD 408–450).|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Eckhart {{moved to}} Australia {{and settled in}} Sydney, where he {{attended}} American International School of Sydney for his high school senior year; he further developed his acting skills in productions like Waiting for Godot, where {{he admits that he}} gave a [...] "terrible" [...] performance. In the autumn of his senior year, Eckhart left school to take a job at the Warringah Mall movie theater. He eventually earned his diploma through an adult education course. This also allowed Eckhart time to enjoy a year of surfing in Hawaii and France, as well as skiing in the Alps. In 1988, Eckhart returned to the United States and enrolled as a film major at Brigham Young University–Hawaii, but later transferred to Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. He graduated in 1994 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. His fortunes <b>changed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> when he was offered the role of George in the film Erin Brockovich, which gave his failing career a much needed boost.

500|$|Crash's {{aesthetic}} {{design in}} the games developed by Radical Entertainment has received mixed reactions from reviewers. Brian Rowe of Game Revolution noted that Crash's fingerless gloves have been replaced with [...] "equally outdated" [...] tribal tattoos and that Crash's personality had been altered from his [...] "obnoxiously extreme attitude" [...] {{to that of a}} [...] "bluthering, googly-eyed idiot". Although Rowe wondered when and why the change happened, he concluded that [...] "it's better than the popular goatee-of-rage that so many other platform giants are sporting these days". Arnold Katayev of PSX Extreme, while admitting that the character detail on Crash was [...] "pretty nice", expressed unhappiness with the artistic choices made for the character; he described Crash's tribal tattoos as [...] "a little pretentious" [...] and noted that the increased definition on his mohawk patch made Crash come off as [...] "trying too hard to be cool". He added that Crash's new fighting style begot a stance that consists of Crash [...] "putting up his dukes like a boxer", which he deemed [...] "out of character" [...] for Crash. Finally, while critiquing the voice acting in Crash of the Titans, he remarked that Crash [...] "especially sounds awful, largely because he doesn't actually speak - he just blabs annoying gibberish, which makes him sound like he's an infant". Matt Keller of PALGN also criticized Crash's voice, which he said made Crash sound [...] "like a confused baby". Louis Bedigian of GameZone stated that [...] "Crash's character design has gone from cool to goofy and now to the dreaded place of being dorky" [...] and said that the minute and gradual changes made to Crash's design throughout the series [...] "have really hurt Crash's appearance as a leading game character". GamePro named Crash's new design as the second worst video game character makeover ever. Craig Harris of IGN was more positive on Crash's new appearance and noted that Crash [...] "looks a little floofier and a lot edgier, gaining a spikier Mohawk and trading in his fingerless gloves for tribal ink all up and down his arms" [...] while comparing his incoherent squawking vocalizations to Kazooie of the Banjo-Kazooie series. He concluded that [...] "ultimately he's been <b>changed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>better.</b> He looks a little cooler and more appealing than his more 'Japanese-inspired' edits over the years".|$|E

2500|$|On June 2, 1924, Du Bois visited Fisk on the {{occasion}} of his daughter Yolanda's graduation, and gave a speech to Fisk students, alumni and guests in connection with the University's commencement exercises. Du Bois was an outspoken critic of Fisk Presidents. In spring 1908, Du Bois visited Fisk to give the university's commencement address, and used the opportunity to criticize President Merrill's addition of industrial coursework at Fisk. While Merrill had no intent to industrialize the Fisk curriculum, the fallout from Du Bois's speech and continued problems fund raising led him to drop the proposal and submit his resignation three months later. [...] Fisk had recently announced the one million dollar fund fully subscribed and irrevocable, and Du Bois sensed the timing to challenge the administration. In front of a packed Fisk Memorial Chapel, and with McKenzie and his wife sitting in the front row, Du Bois declared, [...] "I have come to address you and, I say frankly, I have come to criticize." [...] Asserting that [...] "I have never known an institution whose alumni on the whole are more bitter and disgusted with the present situation in this university than the alumni of Fisk University today." [...] Du Bois endeavored to inform the administration [...] "openly and before your face what so many of your graduates are saying secretly behind your back." [...] Du Bois attacked the Fisk administration as sinister. [...] "For a long time a powerful section of the white South has offered to give its consent and countenance to the higher training of Negroes only on condition that the white South control and guide that education." [...] Du Bois protested that Fisk sold out to Northern foundations and Southern White interests in pursuit of fiscal security. Du Bois remarked, [...] "Of all the essentials that make an institution of learning, money is the least." [...] "And it is possible that for a million dollars the authorities of Fisk University have been asked either openly or by implication to sell to the white South the control of this institution." [...] Du Bois challenged the Fisk code of student conduct and discipline. [...] "I do not for a moment doubt that the object which Fisk today wishes to gain by her discipline are in themselves perfectly good objects," [...] "but the trouble is that she is trying to accomplish her ends by methods which are medieval, and long since discredited." [...] Du Bois suggested students learned discipline through freedom, and lamented, [...] "self-expression and manhood are choked at Fisk in the very day when we need expression to develop manhood in the colored race." [...] Du Bois accused Fisk administrators allowing segregated ticket windows and seating at a Jubilee Singers concert, and of McKenzie leading female members of the Fisk Glee Club through the servants' entrance to sing for Southern White men. Du Bois called on alumni to reclaim Fisk's spirit, and proclaimed, [...] "the alumni of Fisk University are and of right ought to be, the ultimate source of authority in the policy and government" [...] of the University. He argued that alumni had no voice in the policies of Fisk, and complained alumni serving as board members were selected by McKenzie and other trustees and [...] "may not represent the opinion of the alumni." [...] Du Bois encouraged alumni to make public, [...] "what is happening at Fisk University," [...] to organize in order to save Fisk, and to demand elective representation on the board of trustees. Du Bois argued that until conditions at Fisk <b>changed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>better,</b> students should boycott the University.|$|E
