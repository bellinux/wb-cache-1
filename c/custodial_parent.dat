25|$|Moreover, {{something}} that is somewhat unusual in Japanese custody arrangements is the system of koseki, which legally defines households and persons' legal identity in Japanese law. When a non-Japanese marries a Japanese, the foreign spouse's name is recorded into Japanese spouse's koseki upon filing of the marriage, but the spouse's entry is not created in the koseki {{because of lack of}} Japanese citizenship. When their child is born, because the child has Japanese citizenship, an entry is created for the child in the Japanese spouse's koseki. There is a widespread misunderstanding that when a divorce occurs, the foreign spouse is removed from the koseki and the children's custody is automatically kept by the Japanese spouse who hold the koseki. Koseki and custody are not related. The confusion is increased by the fact that completely uncontested divorces are performed not by a court, but by the spouses simply filling out a family registry form at the city hall. When a divorce is finalized at the city hall, the name of the <b>custodial</b> <b>parent</b> of each child must be written in the filing. The name of the <b>custodial</b> <b>parent</b> is then recorded in each child's entry in the koseki. Therefore, it is wrong to assume that unless custody is litigated in Japan, the Japanese parent will automatically hold custody of children in Japan, irrespective of the ruling of the foreign court. A divorce is not finalized in Japan unless custody is agreed to by the spouses or determined by the Japanese court. Furthermore, it is also wrong, but common, to assume that if the <b>custodial</b> <b>parent</b> dies, custody of the child is transferred within the koseki, which would mean that custody would be retained by the dead spouse's new married partner or Japanese grandparents who retain their custody as primary caregiver and would not be transferred to the surviving parent. When a sole <b>custodial</b> <b>parent</b> dies, the family court starts the procedure of appointing a guardian unless one has been designated in the will of the <b>custodial</b> <b>parent.</b>|$|E

With joint physical custody, a court's use of terms such as [...] "primary custodial parent" [...] and [...] "primary residence" [...] may not have much significance beyond being part of the court's division of child tax exemptions between the parents, as both parents are custodial parents.|$|E

2500|$|Consequently, court-mandated visitation in Japan only {{occurs with}} the {{cooperation}} of the <b>custodial</b> <b>parent.</b> U.S. Department of State website states that [...] "compliance with Family Court rulings is essentially voluntary, which renders any ruling unenforceable unless both parents agree."

2500|$|In a 2002 case {{brought by}} atheist Michael Newdow, whose {{daughter}} was being taught the Pledge in school, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the phrase [...] "under God" [...] an unconstitutional endorsement of monotheism when the Pledge was promoted in public school. In 2004, the Supreme Court heard Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, an {{appeal of the}} ruling, and rejected Newdow's claim {{on the grounds that}} he was not the <b>custodial</b> <b>parent,</b> and therefore lacked standing, thus avoiding ruling on the merits of whether the phrase was constitutional in a school-sponsored recitation. On January 3, 2005, a new suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California on behalf of three unnamed families. On September 14, 2005, District Court Judge Lawrence Karlton ruled in their favor. Citing the precedent of the 2002 ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Karlton issued an Order stating that, upon proper motion, he would enjoin the school district defendants from continuing their practices of leading children in pledging allegiance to [...] "one Nation under God." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} the Hague Abduction Convention was drafted {{domestic}} violence was never explicitly considered as an affirmative defense for child abduction, {{although it may be}} brought as a defense under Article 13, if [...] "there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation." [...] Article 13 supposed that the child's primary caretaker would abduct the child to escape the domestic violence of a non-custodial parent. At the time of the Conventions drafting, joint custody laws were rare. One parent was usually both the <b>custodial</b> <b>parent</b> and primary caretaker while the other, non-custodial parent had rights of access. The move towards joint custody laws conferred both the parent who acted as the primary caretaker and their ex-partner with custodial rights and, by extension, a right to request the return of children wrongfully removed from their place of habitual residence. In addition to not accounting for a shift in child custody law towards shared parenting and joint custody, according to Weiner, the framers of the Convention also did little to account for the motivation for abducting a child, generally assuming that all abductions were harmful to children; however, the child's primary caretaker may be fleeing with a child to protect himself or herself from a dangerous domestic situation.|$|E
5000|$|Also, {{where there}} is joint {{physical}} custody, terms of art such as [...] "primary custodial parent" [...] and [...] "primary residence" [...] have no legal meaning other than for determining tax status, and both <b>parents</b> are still <b>custodial</b> <b>parents.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Stating that [...] "children {{need two}} parents" [...] and that [...] "children have a {{fundamental}} human {{right to an}} opportunity and relationship with both their mother and father", members of the fathers' rights movement call for greater equality in parental responsibility following separation and divorce. They call for laws creating a rebuttable presumption of 50/50 shared custody after divorce or separation, so that children would spend equal time with each parent unless there were reasons against it. They point to studies showing that children in shared custody settings are better adjusted and have fewer social problems such as low academic achievement, crime, pregnancy, substance abuse, depression and suicide, and state that shared parenting is in fact {{in the best interests}} of the child. Warren Farrell states that for children, equally shared parenting with three conditions (the child has about equal time with mom and dad, the parents live close enough to each other that the child does not need to forfeit friends or activities when visiting the other parent, and there is no bad-mouthing) is the second best family arrangement to the intact two-parent family, followed by primary father custody and then primary mother custody, and he adds that if shared parenting cannot be agreed upon, children on average are better off psychologically, socially, academically, and physically, have higher levels of empathy and assertiveness, and lower levels of ADHD, if their father is their primary <b>custodial</b> <b>parent</b> rather than their mother.|$|E
2500|$|Spain {{is itself}} a nation cited as a country of concern in the 2002 US State Department Compliance Report. [...] Mexico and Spain both report {{problems}} recovering internationally abducted children from each other's countries. [...] In 2009 Patricia Espinosa, the secretary of Mexican foreign relations, publicly commented that, although both Spain and Mexico had signed the Hague Convention, neither of the countries had returned an abducted child to the other country since 2006 in spite of there being nine abductions of Mexican children to Spain and 12 abductions of Spanish children to Mexico {{during the same time}} period. [...] This mutual noncompliance in honoring the Hague treaty has prompted some to say that both countries are paying each other with the same currency. [...] In 2009 two Spanish fathers made the news in Mexico and Spain for the difficulties they were having in recovering their abducted children from the grandparents of their wives who had recently died of cancer. [...] In both cases the Mexican family filed amparo appeals blocking enforcement of judicial decisions ordering the children returned home to their surviving <b>custodial</b> <b>parent</b> in Spain. [...] One father, after 13 months of litigation and being granted custody of the child in Mexico but denied the ability to leave the country till the decision became final, fled the country and returned to Spain before the legal process finished amidst objections by Mexican authorities that he had acted illegally by removing his son before Mexican courts had finished the lengthy appeal process.|$|E

40|$|The {{proportion}} of {{children living in}} single-parent households has risen dramatically {{during the past two}} decades. Approximately half of these children live in poverty. A major factor in this impoverishment is non-custodial parents'failure to provide child support. Much is known about child support behavior from the <b>custodial</b> <b>parent's</b> perspective, but little research has focused on the noncustodial parent's perspective. The Survey of Absent Parents (SOAP) was initiated to remedy this gap. This paper describes the results of the SOAP pilot survey of linked <b>custodial</b> and non-custodial <b>parents</b> in three counties in Florida and three counties in Ohio. It reports the results of multivariate analyses of the predictors of (i) child support award levels, (ii) child support payments as reported by <b>custodial</b> and non-custodial <b>parents,</b> and (Hi) compliance with child support awards as reported by <b>custodial</b> and non-custodial <b>parents.</b> The results indicate that <b>custodial</b> and non-custodial <b>parents</b> have very different perspectives on how much child support is paid. The main factors predicting payments across these two populations are (i) the non-custodial parent's situation measured by his current income and marital status, (ii) the <b>custodial</b> <b>parent's</b> situation measured by her current income-excluding child support payments-and marital status, (Hi) program interventions such as formulas used to set award levels, payment through the court, and wage withholding, and (iv) the warmth of the relationships between the former partners and between the father and the child.
