500|$|Famitsu {{was highly}} positive, praising the overworld and gameplay: one {{reviewer}} {{felt that it}} would form the new standard for both the Zelda series and video games as a whole. Edge was highly positive about {{all aspects of the}} game aside from the player-driven upgrade system, and even then it was not enough to spoil the experience for the reviewer. Nintendo Power gave it similar praise, saying that [...] "it's truly worthy of being called 'epic'". Ray Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly appreciate the game's nostalgic value, but found the motion control difficult to handle and kept the game from being truly great. Jose Otero, writing for 1UP.com, praised the developers for putting effort into moving away from Zelda tradition and called it one of the better games in the series, but said that those detrimental elements that remained such as side quests and some item usage made Skyward Sword [...] "a weird middle ground filled with genuine surprises, inessential <b>carry-overs,</b> and copy/paste quest structures".|$|E

Twin scoops designed to channel cool air into the driver's compartment also appeared on the Club de Mer, and resurfaced over a decade later on the 1967 Firebird and 1968 GTO. The horizontal fender louvers appeared as vertical slits on the 1957 Star Chief Bonneville and 1965 2+2. The bold tail fins were softened and adapted on 1955 and '56 Pontiac models. The 1958 Bonneville's instrument panel borrowed the Special's sleek stainless steel style, and the finned wheel covers became a design cue for Pontiac's famous 8-lug, aluminium rims introduced in 1960.|$|E
50|$|The United States National Park Service, often {{referred}} to as the USNPS, or just NPS, is run by the United States Department of Interior, and is charged with protecting, preserving, and interpreting the nation's national parks. While the first national park, Yellowstone, was created in 1872, the National Park Service itself has only existed since 1916. There was no unifying dress for park officials across the nation until the United States Army Cavalry took over the protection of the parks, bringing to the parks the first real uniforms; until this happened in 1886, the clothing for officials was as varied as the individuals themselves. For nearly a century since it was officially established, the USNPS underwent several major uniform changes, although several items, such as the distinctive campaign hat, are <b>carry-overs</b> from the early days. Eventually, the uniform became the easily recognizable gray shirt and green trousers that can be seen on NPS Rangers today.|$|E

5000|$|The {{advertising}} carryover {{effect is}} a famous and debated effect of business marketing practices. Essentially, the carryover theory states that the positive benefits from advertising, especially increased sales, are not perfectly in step with advertising movements but rather delayed and spread out over time so that changes may not be noticeable immediately or measurable right after the advertising strategy has gone into effect. Carryover (measured {{from the end of}} a campaign) ranges between 3 weeks and 6 months. This establishes that consumer involvement has a noticeably positive impact on carry-over, as involved consumers have a better memory for commercials. Studies show long and expensive campaigns, result in competitive clutter, when several brands advertise simultaneously, competitive interference depreciates campaign accessibility and makes individuals forget the message more quickly. Observations show noticeable wear-out effects as <b>carry-overs</b> are shortened when brands air multiple campaigns and/or increase the size of their advertising budget. These results are noteworthy because it shows that advertising intensity, competitive interference and wear-out effects have impacts on advertising effectiveness.

Several ministers in the Andhra Pradesh Government are <b>carry-overs</b> from the corruption tainted YSR government. The extent of corruption in the YSR government was even highlighted in the US state department cables exposed by Wikileaks. In the inter-related investigations into the OMC mining scandal, the EMAAR-MGF Boulder Hills scam and the inquiry into the inordinate wealth of Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy allegedly accumulated as a quid-pro-quo for favours received from the Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy government, the CBI has focused on various IAS officers. IAS officers from Andhra Pradesh including Srilakshmi, Rajagopal, B. P. Acharya, L. V. Subrahmanyam, K. V. Rao, K. Ratna Prabha etc. have been arrested, charge-sheeted or have been questioned by the CBI in the investigation. The AP IAS Officers Association alleged that they were made scapegoats for the decisions forced by the supervising ministers. They suggested that the decisions that incriminated the IAS officers took, could not have been implemented without the approval of concerned members of the Council of Ministers. The IAS officers alleged that the ministers, who belong to the Congress Party, suspected of involvement in the same cases have been left untouched by the CBI, which is controlled by the home ministry of the Congress-led UPA government at the center in New Delhi. The officers have challenged the CBI procedures in these arrests. While Opposition political parties have suggested that the IAS officers name the ministers responsible for corruption in Andhra Pradesh, the Congress party functionaries have denied that the officers are being made scapegoats. Several other voices including the former vigilance commissioner, Ramachandra Samal, have reiterated that the system is deep in corruption.|$|E
40|$|In data envelopment analysis, {{there are}} several methods for {{measuring}} efficiency change over time, e. g. the window analysis and the Malmquist index. However, they usually neglect carry-over activities between consecutive two terms. These <b>carry-overs</b> {{play an important role}} in measuring the efficiency of decision making units in each term as well as over the whole terms based on the long-term viewpoint. Dynamic DEA model proposed by Färe and Grosskopf is the first innovative contribution for such purpose. In this paper we develop their model in the slacks-based measure (SBM) framework, called Dynamic SBM (DSBM). The SBM model is non-radial and can deal with inputs/outputs individually, contrary to the radial approaches that assume proportional changes in inputs/outputs. Furthermore, according to the characteristics of <b>carry-overs,</b> we classify them into four categories, i. e. desirable, undesirable, free and fixed. Desirable <b>carry-overs</b> correspond, for example, to profit carried forward and net earned surplus carried to the next term, while undesirable <b>carry-overs</b> include, for example, loss carried forward, bad debt and dead stock. Free and fixed <b>carry-overs</b> indicate, respectively, discretionary and non-discretionary ones.

We solve a model which is applicable to general bill-of-material structures and which includes minimum lead times of one period and multi-period setup <b>carry-overs.</b> Our algorithm solves a series of mixed-integer linear programs in an iterative so-called Fix-and-Optimize approach. In each instance of these mixed-integer linear programs a large number of binary setup variables is fixed whereas only a small subset of these variables is optimized, together with the complete set of the inventory and lot size variables.
