40|$|Abstract We {{analyze the}} {{characteristics}} of protein–protein interfaces using the largest datasets available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We start with a comparison of interfaces with protein <b>cores</b> <b>and</b> non-interface surfaces. The results show that interfaces differ from protein <b>cores</b> <b>and</b> non-interface surfaces in residue composition, sequence entropy, and secondary structure. Since interfaces, protein <b>cores,</b> <b>and</b> non-interface surfaces have different solvent accessibilities, {{it is important to}} investigate whether the observed differences are due to the differences in solven...|$|R

5|$|Dry air {{and land}} {{weakened}} the tropical wave, {{and when it}} entered {{the area of the}} Bay of Campeche, it merged with a stationary frontal boundary. Cool, dry air around the system caused the system to develop a cold <b>core,</b> <b>and</b> the area organized into an extratropical low on September 30. A large high pressure system over the northern Gulf of Mexico forced the system southward, where it developed significant convection. The system developed a warm <b>core,</b> <b>and</b> on October 1 the storm organized into Tropical Storm Larry while located 300mi (483km) east-southeast of Tampico, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|During extratropical transition, the cyclone {{begins to}} tilt {{back into the}} colder airmass with height, and the cyclone's primary energy source {{converts}} from the release of latent heat from condensation (from thunderstorms near the center) to baroclinic processes.

40|$|In 1990, the US Geological Survey, in {{cooperation}} with the US Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office, established the Lithologic Core Storage Library at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). The facility was established to consolidate, catalog, and permanently store nonradioactive drill <b>cores</b> <b>and</b> cuttings from investigations of the subsurface conducted at the INEL, and to provide a location for researchers to examine, sample, and test these materials. The facility is open by appointment to researchers for examination, sampling, <b>and</b> testing of <b>cores</b> <b>and</b> cuttings. This report describes the facility <b>and</b> <b>cores</b> <b>and</b> cuttings stored at the facility. Descriptions of <b>cores</b> <b>and</b> cuttings include the well names, well locations, and depth intervals available. Most <b>cores</b> <b>and</b> cuttings stored at the facility were drilled at or near the INEL, on the eastern Snake River Plain; however, two cores drilled on the western Snake River Plain are stored for comparative studies. Basalt, rhyolite, sedimentary interbeds, and surficial sediments compose the majority of <b>cores</b> <b>and</b> cuttings, most of which are continuous from land surface to their total depth. The deepest core stored at the facility was drilled to 5, 000 feet below land surface. This report describes procedures and researchers` responsibilities for access to the facility, and examination, sampling, and return of materials...|$|R

5|$|Lieder {{described}} Planet X as roughly {{four times}} the size of the Earth, and said that its closest approach would occur on May 27, 2003, resulting in the Earth's rotation ceasing for exactly 5.9 terrestrial days. This would be followed by the Earth's pole destabilising in a pole shift (a physical pole shift, with the Earth's pole physically moving, rather than a geomagnetic reversal) caused by magnetic attraction between the Earth's <b>core</b> <b>and</b> the magnetism of the passing planet. This in turn would disrupt the Earth's magnetic <b>core</b> <b>and</b> lead to subsequent displacement of the Earth's crust.|$|E

5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and <b>core,</b> <b>and</b> connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E

5|$|Although extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are almost}} always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient within the westerlies, they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with radius. An extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone, if it dwells over warm waters sufficient to warm its <b>core,</b> <b>and</b> as a result develops central convection. A particularly intense type of extratropical cyclone that strikes during winter is known colloquially as a nor'easter.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers {{characterize}} the morphology of a globular cluster {{by means of}} standard radii.
