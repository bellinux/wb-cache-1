50|$|While {{frequent}} throughout Europe {{during the}} Medieval period and before, wooded meadows have largely disappeared. Wooded meadows originated from {{the practices of}} hunter-gatherer communities. They were {{important in terms of}} social organization around a natural resource and determined much of the community's interactions with the natural world. In the early 20th century, wooded meadows were used for fruit cultivation in Sweden, however their prevalence has decreased substantially due to changes in land management and a movement toward more intensive types of agroecosystems. The more typical, <b>calcicolous</b> wooded meadows are common around the Baltic Sea.|$|E

5000|$|Pentaglottis sempervirens, {{the green}} alkanet, {{evergreen}} bugloss or alkanet, is a bristly, perennial plant native to Western Europe. It grows to approximately 60 cm (24") to 90 cm (36"), usually in damp or shaded places and often close to buildings. It has brilliant blue flowers, and retains its green leaves through the winter. The plant has difficulty growing in acidic soil (it is <b>calcicolous).</b> The name [...] "alkanet" [...] {{is also used}} for dyer's bugloss (Alkanna tinctoria) and common bugloss (Anchusa officinalis). Green Alkanet is an introduced species in the British Isles, meaning it is not native.|$|E
50|$|Carsten Erik Olsen (March 1, 1891 - August 19, 1974) was a Danish plant {{ecologist}} {{and plant}} physiologist, who pioneered {{the study of}} plant nutrition in soils of different pH.

His doctoral dissertation (1921) was {{on the influence of}} soil pH on the natural distribution of plants. He was then employed by the Carlsberg Laboratory as an assistant to the chemist S. P. L.

50|$|Some {{industrial}} waste products, such as spoil from mining, or alkaloids from other industrial processes were disposed of locally. Caustic waste from the Leblanc process was dumped {{on at least}} two sites - Nob End, to the south of Bolton and Lower Hinds in Bury. The waste on both sites has since weathered-down to calcium carbonate and has provided an ideal environment for a number of nationally rare <b>calcicolous</b> plants, unique in what is predominately an area of acidic soil. These plants, along with non-indigenous garden escapees such as Giant Hogweed and Himalayan Balsam, have added much variety to the flora of the valley. Nob End was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1988 and a Local Nature Reserve in 2000.|$|E

40|$|In Belgium, at {{the western}} border of its {{continental}} distribution range, the perennial herb S. nutans has evolved two parapatric ecotypes (<b>calcicolous</b> or silicicolous), which show contrasted allozyme, morphological and adaptive patterns, and isolating reproductive barriers. We examined allozyme variation in 21 populations close to Belgium (from France and Luxemburg) {{in relation to their}} peripheral or central geographical position, and investigated their genetic relationships with the Belgian ecotypes. Both peripheral and central populations showed high genetic variation. They were differentiated from each other, but not in relation to the substrate (calcareous or siliceous). The peripheral and central populations were related to the Belgian silicicolous and <b>calcicolous</b> ecotype, respectively. This suggests an ancient differentiation and different past histories for the Belgian ecotypes, and parapatric speciation processes. This study exemplifies the high evolutionary potential of populations at range peripheries and the need for considering them in conservation strategies.

Individuals of four species of land snails (Balea perversa, Chondrina cliema, Clausilia bidentata and Helicigona lapicida) were allowed to graze on identified lichen species growing on pieces of limestone. Snail grazing on thalli and ascocarps was classified into four categories ranging from no damage to completely eaten. In general, some lichen species were heavily grazed, whereas others were only slightly damaged or not injured. Aspiciha calcarea, Tephromela atra and Verrucaria nigrescens were preferred by all snail species except Chondrina cliema. In general, lichen thalli that were not immersed in the calcareous rock and cyanobacteria were preferred, whereas ascocarps were avoided by one of the snail species (C. clienta).

40|$|The Seslerio albicantis-Tilietum cordatae is {{described}} as a new association of the <b>calcicolous</b> forests in the Czech Republic. It includes species-rich Tilia cordata or T. platyphyllos dominated forests with a mixture of mesophilous forest species and thermophilous oak-forest species in the field layer, confined to shallow soils of the upper slopes. During the postglacial period, these forests probably developed from Sesleria albicans-grassland and Corylus avellana-scrub and preserved a number of relict species. Comparative analysis of selected literature data on Central European <b>calcicolous</b> forests dominated by Tilia species yielded 6 major floristically defined groups and a few communities of local importance.

40|$|The {{vegetation}} {{in north}} Minas Gerais State is poorly known, {{and for some}} authors it is the southern limit of natural occurrence for 'carrasco' and 'caatinga' species. Floristic sampling was made in different areas of Januária municipality, Minas Gerais, including physiognomies of 'carrasco' (tree-shrub 'caatinga'), deciduous forest, 'cerrado', floodable field and riparian vegetation ('vereda'), besides <b>calcicolous</b> vegetation. Six-hundred-eight species in 114 families were found, the five most diverse families were Fabaceae (87 species), Asteraceae (35 species), Euphorbiaceae (28 species), Bignoniaceae (25 species), and Malpighiaceae (21 species). The sampled vegetation included a diversity of vegetation forms. The most diverse areas were the 'carrasco' and the deciduous forest (274 species), secondary vegetation along roads and trails, and pastures (160 species), 'cerrado' (105 species), 'vereda' (98 species), and <b>calcicolous</b> vegetation and riparian vegetation (78 species each).
