50|$|In 1966 the Chilean {{government}} renamed Isla Más Afuera as Alejandro Selkirk Island, with Isla Más <b>a</b> <b>Tierra</b> becoming Robinson Crusoe Island. Alexander Selkirk was a Scottish sailor who was marooned as a castaway on Más <b>a</b> <b>Tierra</b> (then uninhabited) from 1704 to 1709. His {{story of}} survival likely inspired the 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe.|$|R

On 1 January 1966 Chilean president Eduardo Frei Montalva renamed Más <b>a</b> <b>Tierra</b> Robinson Crusoe Island after Defoe's fictional character to attract tourists. The largest of the Juan Fernández Islands, known as Más Afuera, became Alejandro Selkirk Island, although Selkirk probably never saw that island since it is located 180 km to the west.|$|R

40|$|Helium, Sr, and Nd isotopic {{ratios and}} major and trace element {{compositions}} have been {{measured on a}} suite of lavas from the intra-plate volcanos of the Juan Fernandez Archipelago, Chile. Lavas from the islands of Mas Afuera and Mas <b>a</b> <b>Tierra</b> and from Monte Alpha and Friday seamounts have Sr and Nd isotopic ratios lying on the low ^(143) Nd/^(144) Nd side of the mantle array (^(87) Sr/^(86) Sr: 0. 7034 – 0. 7037; ^(143) Nd/^(144) Nd: 0. 51281 – 0. 51289). The homogeneity of these tracers suggests the involvement of a restricted range of mantle source compositions throughout Juan Fernandez volcanism. In marked contrast is the large range in ^ 3 He/^ 4 He, from 7. 8 to 18. 0 R_A. A bimodal ^ 3 He/^ 4 He distribution on Mas <b>a</b> <b>Tierra</b> is associated with two distinct volcanic lineages; ^ 3 He/^ 4 He ratios of 14. 5 – 18. 0 R_A (n= 15) occur in alkalic and tholeiitic shield basalts, whereas post-shield basanites range from 11. 2 to 13. 6 R_A (n= 12). Elemental and isotopic systematics demonstrate a transition from an enriched (Loihi-like) plume source in the shield lavas to a more MORB-like source in the post-shield volcanics. The transition between these sources is much more pronounced in ^ 3 He/^ 4 He than in the other isotopic tracers. The predominantly tholeiitic basalts of Mas Afuera have exceptionally uniform isotopic and elemental characteristics; Sr and Nd ratios {{are similar to those}} of Mas <b>a</b> <b>Tierra,</b> but ^ 3 He/^ 4 He ratios are lower and more uniform at 8. 3 ± 0. 5 R_A (n= 17). The dramatic distinction between Mas Afuera and Mas <b>a</b> <b>Tierra</b> helium is surprising given the great similarity between the two islands in other geochemical characteristics. Both the Mas Afuera and Mas <b>a</b> <b>Tierra</b> results demonstrate that helium records systematic processes not readily apparent from other isotopic or elemental indicators. Neither magma chamber degassing nor local metasomatic events are likely to be responsible. We suggest that the observed variations may be attributed to mixing of plume and asthenospheric sources in which the plume component is characterized by a heterogeneous distribution of volatiles or has suffered extraction of small degree partial melts prior to mixing...|$|R

50|$|The Juan Fernández {{archipelago}} is {{also well}} known for its jungles and endemic flora, formed by the islands Robinson Crusoe, Santa Clara and Alexander Selkirk, its geological origin is volcanic and its subtropical weather is rainy. Varied are the activities that can be performed, among which hiking, horseback riding, snorkeling, spearfishing, fishing, and observation of flora and fauna, which is mostly endemic. The Juan Fenández Islands are also known for being inhabited by Alexander Selkirk, the man who inspired the Robinson Crusoe novel. In 1966 the Chilean government renamed Island Más Afuera to Alejandro Selkirk and Island Más <b>a</b> <b>Tierra</b> to Robinson Crusoe, {{in order to promote}} tourism.
