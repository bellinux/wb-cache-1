5|$|Walter Raleigh Gilbert (16 September 1853 – 26 July 1924) was an English amateur cricketer {{who played}} {{first-class}} cricket for Middlesex and Gloucestershire between 1873 and 1886. A cousin of W. G. Grace, {{he played for}} Gloucestershire when, dominated by the Grace family, it was the leading county. Gilbert's best season was 1876, when he scored 205 not out for the county, but he was subsequently less successful. Closely connected with the United South of England Eleven, a professional touring team of which he eventually became secretary, Gilbert was financially affected by a declining interest in such teams. With insufficient income to continue as an amateur he became a professional in 1886, but played only one match before he was caught stealing from teammates in a minor match, ending his first-class career. After serving a 28-day prison sentence Gilbert moved to Canada, where {{he worked for the}} Land Titles Office in Calgary while remaining a prominent cricketer. He died aged 70 in 1924, but for nearly 60 years after his death, {{there seemed to be a}} <b>conspiracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>silence</b> over his fate.|$|E

In this paper we question the usefulness of the term and suggest that "cultural censorship", a concept developed by the anthropologist Robin Sherriff, provides a much needed insight into cultures <b>of</b> <b>silence</b> within the NHS. Drawing on a number of illustrations, but in particular the Ritchie inquiry into the disgraced gynaecologist Rodney Ledward, we show how the defining characteristics of cultural censorship can help us to understand how adverse events get pushed underground, only to flourish in the underside of organisational life...|$|R
40|$|This paper, 1 {{which results}} from {{nearly a decade}} (1997 - 2006) of {{continuous}} field research in the centre of Mozambique, analyses {{the ways in which}} Mozambican war survivors managed to develop socio-cultural approaches to deal peacefully with the legacies of an extremely violent past. More specifically, it focuses on the contributions of a civil-war-related spirit named gamba in the former war zones of the Gorongosa district, and central Mozambique more generally. This paper is organised in three sections. Following a brief introduction in which the goals of the paper are stated, Section Two outlines some aspects of the Mozambican civil war and its consequences at community level. Section Three describes the emergence of the magamba spirits in the Gorongosa district and demonstrates how these war-related spirits break the prevailing <b>conspiracies</b> <b>of</b> <b>silence</b> over a past of civil war violence. This section also presents how magamba deal with issues of truth, justice and reconciliation. In Gorongosa, reconciliation is a multidimensional phenomenon and magamba spirits demonstrate th...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the origin and}} implications of the &# 8220;war on cancer&# 8221; metaphor. Commonly present in mass media, the &# 8220;war on cancer&# 8221; notion circulates also among patients, their loved ones, their support networks, and oncological multidisciplinary teams. In our view when cancer is uprooted of its illness status, and conceptualized as an &# 8220;enemy&# 8221;, myths about disease and those who suffer it (especially the idea of psychogenesis) are strengthened. Two topics in which the war metaphor is particularly problematic in the clinical context, are analyzed in depth. The first one {{is the relationship between}} the oncologic patient and his or her loved ones and support networks. When patients are insistently prompted to fight the disease and think positive, the expression of emotions associated to the adaptive process of receiving a diagnosis of cancer may be inhibited. Secondly, the war metaphor promotes an authoritarian view among the health teams and on the physician-patient relationship, undermining the patent&# 8217;s autonomy in the decision-making process, which may affect his global quality of life. Also, it encourages emotional isolation, concealment of psychiatric symptoms and <b>conspiracies</b> <b>of</b> <b>silence.</b> It is concluded that public policies to avoid the &# 8220;war on&# 8221; notion are required. Instead, education of the general population about wrong beliefs about cancer should be encouraged...|$|R
40|$|Non Governmental Organisations in Bosnia and Herzegovina {{rose out of}} {{the ground}} like {{mushrooms}} during and after the destructive Balkan war of the early nineties to provide help to the victims and survivors. During the conflict, tens of thousands of women were raped and an unknown number of them birthed children out of these rapes, who hardly ever received any attention from the national media, state policies or NGOs’ programmes and projects. Considering the fact there is and {{has been a lot of}} media attention paid to the women who were raped and there are several known organisations that provide them with counselling and medical treatment, even in a patriarchal society as Bosnia and Herzegovina, it became clear that there was no attention whatsoever paid to their children. Wanting to know the reason behind this, I set out to interview NGOs in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to explore why they did not incorporate this group of children in their programmes and projects. From their answers, I was able to establish three different reasons for this, which all revolve around the concepts <b>of</b> <b>silence,</b> denial and stigmatisation. Therefore, in this thesis I explain the special and difficult status that children born from war rape have in the society of Bosnia and Herzegovina, examine the reasons NGOs gave me for not paying attention to this group along the lines <b>of</b> the <b>conspiracies</b> <b>of</b> <b>silence</b> theory and then look towards the future to explore possible ways to incorporate them in society and to what extent this is actually wanted...|$|R
60|$|We {{young people}} had {{practically}} no preparation {{at all for}} the stir and emotions of adolescence. Towards the young the world maintained a <b>conspiracy</b> <b>of</b> stimulating <b>silences.</b> There came no initiation. There were books, stories of a curiously conventional kind that insisted on certain qualities in every love affair and greatly intensified one's natural desire for them, perfect trust, perfect loyalty, lifelong devotion. Much of the complex essentials of love were altogether hidden. One read these things, got accidental glimpses of this and that, wondered and forgot, and so one grew. Then strange emotions, novel alarming desires, dreams strangely charged with feeling; an inexplicable impulse of self-abandonment began to tickle queerly amongst the familiar purely egotistical and materialistic things of boyhood and girlhood. We were like misguided travelers who had camped in the dry bed of a tropical river. Presently we were knee deep and neck deep in the flood. Our beings were suddenly going out from ourselves seeking other beings--we knew not why. This novel craving for abandonment to some {{one of the other}} sex, bore us away. We were ashamed and full of desire. We kept the thing a guilty secret, and were resolved to satisfy it against all the world. In this state it was we drifted in the most accidental way against some other blindly seeking creature, and linked like nascent atoms.|$|R

500|$|After Gilbert's retirement, {{and even}} {{following}} his death, controversy remained {{attached to his}} name; {{there seemed to be}} a <b>conspiracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>silence</b> surrounding his fate. Cricket historians rarely mentioned him, despite his varied career. W. G. Grace, although including Gilbert in an appendix of leading batsmen in his 1891 book Cricket, did not include him in the text at all, despite the book's more than 400pages; in his Cricketers I Have Met, Grace described 121cricketers but did not mention his cousin. Further evidence of Gilbert's disgrace came in the pages of Wisden. Although Gilbert began as an amateur cricketer, which entitled him to have [...] "Mr." [...] before his name in the [...] "Births and Deaths" [...] section, he was referred to until his death as [...] "Gilbert, W. R.", which denoted a professional. However, in his Wisden obituary he received the title [...] "Mr. W. R. Gilbert", even though the [...] "Births and Deaths" [...] still listed him as a professional, and in 1935 he was once again restored to amateur status in [...] "Births and Deaths", for reasons which are unclear. The same obituary glossed over Gilbert's enforced retirement from cricket, simply observing: [...] "At the beginning of 1886 he became a professional, and the season was not far advanced before his career in first-class cricket ended abruptly. He then left England for Canada." [...] Even in 1970, the silence continued; historian Rowland Bowen wrote about the story but concluded by saying: [...] "Another indication of the recurring instinct for suppression was a suggestion to me that if this story had not appeared in print before (it has not) it should not now." [...] It is not clear who made this suggestion, whether it was descendants of the Grace family, a cricket administrator or someone else. It was not until 1984 that the full story was published by historian Robert Brook. In reviewing what he considered to be the injustice of the case, and reflecting on Gilbert's success in Canada, Green wrote: [...] "No wonder that those responsible for this act of appalling cruelty went to such fatuous lengths to keep its details a secret." ...|$|E
