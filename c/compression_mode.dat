25|$|From 16 March 2015, Opera Mini's extreme <b>compression</b> <b>mode</b> uses an {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} Presto layout engine that is included in Opera 12. Consequently, Opera Mini supports most of the web standards supported in Opera 12. Presto's development has continued for Opera Mini and further support was added for HTML5 input types, CSS Flexbox model, CSS rem units and ECMAScript 5. However, unlike the desktop edition of Opera, frames are flattened because of client limitations, and dotted or dashed borders are displayed as solid borders due to bandwidth and memory issues. As Opera Mini reformats web pages, it does not pass the Acid2 standards compliance test. Opera Mini supports bi-directional text, meaning that it can correctly display right-to-left scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew in addition to languages written left-to-right. However, it will not display right-to-left text if the font size is set to small or very small. Indic and Chinese scripts are supported only if an appropriate font is installed on the device as the default system font.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{recording}} of color still images into magneto–optical video disks has been increasingly {{used as a}} method for recording electronic endoscopic images. In this case, image compression {{is often used to}} reduce the volume and cost of recording media and also to minimize the time required for image recording and playback. With this in mind, we recorded 8 images into a magneto-optical video disk in 4 image <b>compression</b> <b>modes</b> (no <b>compression,</b> weak compression, moderate compression, and strong compression) using the Joint Photographic Image Coding Experts Group (JPEG) system, which is a widely used and representative method for compressing color still images, {{in order to determine the}} relationship between the degree of image compression and the color information in electronic endoscopic images. The acquired images were transferred to an image processor using an offline system. A total of 10 regions of interest (ROls) were selected, and red (R), green (G), and blue (B) images were obtained using different <b>compression</b> <b>modes.</b> From histograms generated for these images, mean densities of R, G, and B in each ROI were measured and analyzed. The results revealed that color changes were greater for B, which had the lowest density, than for R or G as the degree of compression was increased...|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} BRC determines QL for {{the next}} one or two lines from the BRC table based on previously selected <b>compression</b> <b>mode</b> which is either 1 L or 2 L. The <b>compression</b> <b>mode</b> of the previous line(s) was selected because it had better compression ratio with relatively lower QL of the selected mode. In other words, the QL used for the other mode that was not selected did not achieve enough compression ratio. Therefore, if the BRC decides to increase compression ratio by one step more {{for the next}} line and alter the <b>compression</b> <b>mode,</b> the QL of the new mode for the next line(s) should be increased by two steps to meet the demand.|$|E

40|$|Using {{effective}} lagrangians which {{correspond to}} a wide range of values for K 1 relativistic RPA calculations are performed for monopole and dipole compression modes in nuclei. It is found that Dirac sea states have an important effect on <b>compression</b> <b>mode</b> energies. Including these negative energy states into relativistic RPA brings the results into general agreement with those of time-dependent relativistic mean field calculations. Comparison with the giant monopole resonance data in 208 Pb indicates that K 1 is around 240 MeV. However, the dipole <b>compression</b> <b>mode</b> is predicted above 25 MeV in 208 Pb in strong disagreement with experiment...|$|E
40|$|Hydrodynamic {{interactions}} between particles confined in a liquid-filled linear channel {{are known to}} be screened beyond a distance comparable to the channel width. Using a simple analytical theory and lattice-Boltzmann simulations, we show that the hydrodynamic screening is qualitatively modified when the time-dependent response and finite compressibility of the host liquid are taken into account. Diffusive <b>compression</b> <b>modes</b> in the confined liquid cause the particles to have velocity correlations of unbounded range, whose amplitude decays with time only as $t^{- 3 / 2 }$.

40|$|The lattice {{dynamics}} of low-frequency rigid-plane modes in metallic (graphene multilayers, GML) and in insulating (hexagonal boron-nitride multilayers, BNML) layered crystals is investigated. The frequencies of shearing and <b>compression</b> (stretching) <b>modes</b> {{depend on the}} layer number N and are presented {{in the form of}} fan diagrams. The results for GML and BNML are very similar. In both cases only the interactions (van der Waals and Coulomb) between nearest-neighbor planes are effective, while the interactions between more distant planes are screened. A comparison with recent Raman scattering results on low-frequency shear modes in GML [Tan et al., arXiv: 1106. 1146 v 1 (2011) ] is made. Relations with the low-lying rigid-plane phonon dispersions in the bulk materials are established. Master curves which connect the fan diagram frequencies for any given N are derived. Static and dynamic thermal correlation functions for rigid-layer shear and <b>compression</b> <b>modes</b> are calculated. The results might be of use for the interpretation of friction force experiments on multilayer crystals...|$|R

While measurements of the axial <b>compression</b> <b>mode</b> in the cigar-shaped trap close to a Feshbach resonance confirm theoretical expectations, the radial <b>compression</b> <b>mode</b> shows surprising features. In the strongly interacting molecular BEC regime we observe a negative frequency shift with increasing coupling strength. In the regime of a strongly interacting Fermi gas, an abrupt change in the collective excitation frequency occurs, which may be a signature for a transition from a superfluid to a collisionless phase.

40|$|A fully {{consistent}} relativistic RPA calculation {{is performed}} for the monopole and dipole compression modes in nuclei. The emphasis {{is put on}} the effects of Dirac sea states which are generally neglected in relativistic RPA calculations. It is found that these effects can be quite important for the isoscalar monopole mode. The main contributions from the pairs of Fermi and Dirac sea states are through the exchange of the scalar meson, while the vector mesons play a negligible role. Numerical results of relativistic RPA are checked with the constrained RMF model in the monopole case. For the monopole <b>compression</b> <b>mode,</b> a comparison of experimental and calculated energies gives a value of 230 MeV for the nuclear matter incompressibility.

40|$|By using a sum rule {{approach}} {{we investigate}} the transition between the hydrodynamic and the collisionless regime {{of the collective}} modes in a 1 D harmonically trapped Bose gas. Both the weakly interacting gas and the Tonks-Girardeau limits are considered. We predict that the excitation of the dipole <b>compression</b> <b>mode</b> is characterized, in the high temperature collisionless regime, by a beating signal of two different frequencies (ω_z and 3 ω_z) while, in the high temperature collisional regime, the excitation consists of a single frequency (√(7) ω_z). This behaviour differs from {{the case of the}} lowest breathing mode whose excitation consists of a single frequency (2 ω_z) in both regimes. Our predictions for the dipole <b>compression</b> <b>mode</b> open promising perspectives for the experimental investigation of collisional effects in 1 D configurations.

40|$|International audienceMolybdenum {{disulfide}} (MoS 2) is {{a promising}} material for making two-dimensional crystals and flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices at the nanoscale. MoS 2 flakes can show high mobilities and {{have even been}} integrated in nanocircuits. A fundamental requirement for such use is efficient thermal transport. Electronic transport generates heat which needs to be evacuated, more crucially so in nanostructures. Anharmonic phonon- phonon scattering is the dominant intrinsic limitation to thermal transport in insulators. Here, using appropriate samples, ultralow energy Raman spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we provide a full experimental and theoretical description of <b>compression</b> and shear <b>modes</b> of few-layer (FL) MoS 2.
