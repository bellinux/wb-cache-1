40|$|The flavour {{attributes}} of <b>cocoa</b> <b>liquors</b> prepared from some cocoa clones {{planted in the}} International Clonal Trials of eight different countries were evaluated over two years on seven main flavour traits to examine individual and combined clonal and environmental effects. Fermented and dried cocoa bean samples were prepared in each country according to standardized protocols and the samples were evaluated for any defects before liquors were prepared according to a standard method. Sensory evaluation was undertaken by three panels, one consisting of two panellists and two consisting of one panellist. The results showed low coefficients of correlation between panels for the descriptors evaluated. However, the Multiple Factorial Analysis showed some common features between panels, depending on the axes. With regard to specific flavour attributes, acidity, bitterness and astringency were opposed to cocoa flavour intensity whilst floral flavour {{appeared to be the}} most independent flavour trait, related mainly to the clone for the two years' data that were analysed. Significant year and country effects were observed for cocoa flavour, acidity and astringency. The interaction between clones and countries (environment) were nonsignificant (P= 0. 05), although the P values were relatively low (varying between 0. 06 and 0. 34). (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Metabolomics is {{a proven}} tool to obtain {{information}} about differences in food stuffs and to select biochemical markers for sensory quality of food products. A valuable application of untargeted metabolomics is the selection of metabolites that are (highly) predictive for sensory or phenotypical traits for use as (bio) markers. This chapter demonstrates how to robustly select key metabolites and evaluate their predictive properties. The proposed approach constrains the number of selected metabolites, searching for an optimal number of predictive metabolites by cross-validation. This mitigates the problem of selection of spurious metabolites. It also enables straightforward use of linear regression. In the present implementation simple forward selection is used. In concert with a second cross-validation to assess the predictive power of the selected set of metabolites, the proposed method involves two leave-one-out cross-validations and will {{be referred to as}} LOO 2 CV. In the second leave-one-out cross-validation a multitude of regression models is generated. This offers additional information that is potentially useful for selection of key metabolites in the spirit of stability selection. The proposed LOO 2 CV approach is illustrated with sensory and large-scale metabolomics data from a set of 76 different <b>cocoa</b> <b>liquors.</b> The proposed approach is compared with conventional stepwise regression and stepwise regression in concert with cross-validation for evaluation of predictive power of the model...|$|R

40|$|Chocolate is a {{confectionery}} product, mainly containing <b>cocoa</b> mass or <b>liquor,</b> <b>cocoa</b> butter (CB) and sugar. Nowadays {{vegetable fats}} and modified oil are {{used instead of}} CB in chocolate products to lower the cost and to obtain the varieties of products with different characteristics and textures. Cocoa butter-like fat from modified palm oil (CBFMPO) {{at different levels of}} CB replacement (60, 80 and 100 %) were used to develop a formulation of coating chocolate. When physical and sensory properties were evaluated, the viscosity and coating ability on biscuit sticks were remarkedly decreased with increasing CBFMPO content. Hedonic mean scores of mouthfeel and coating ability of the chocolate containing 100 % CBFMPO were greater than those of chocolate containing 60 and 80 % CBFMPO (p< 0. 05). During storage of biscuit sticks dipped in the chocolate coating (chocolate containing 100 % CBFMPO) at room temperature (27 - 29 oC) and low temperature (20 - 22 oC) for 30 days, blooming (as shown by whiteness index) occurred to a greater extent at higher temperature.

40|$|International audienceConcentrations and {{bioavailability}} of cadmium (Cd) {{and lead}} (Pb) were determined in cocoa powders and related products (beans, liquor, butter) of different geographical origins. Particular attention {{was paid to}} the fractionation of these metals, which was investigated by determining the metal fraction soluble in extractant solutions acting selectively with regard to the different classes of ligands. The targeted classes of Cd and Pb species included: water-soluble compounds, polypeptide and polysaccharide complexes, and compounds soluble in simulated gastrointestinal conditions. The bioavailability of Cd and Pb from <b>cocoa</b> powder, <b>liquor</b> and butter was evaluated using a sequential enzymolysis approach. The data obtained {{as a function of the}} geographical origin of the samples indicated strong differences not only in terms of the total Cd and Pb concentrations, but also with regard to the bioavailability of these metals. The Cd concentrations in the cocoa powders varied from 94 to 1833 g kg- 1, of which 10 - 50 % was potentially bioavailable. The bioavailability of Pb was generally below 10 % and the concentrations measured in the cocoa powders were in the 11 - 769 ?g kg- 1 range.

The solubility of Cd and Pb in the corresponding enzymatic extracts was measured by ICP MS. The bioaccessibility of Cd in cocoa varied from 10 to 50 % in gastrointestinal conditions. An additional 20 or 30 % of Cd could be recovered by phytase and cellulase, respectively. The bioaccessibility of Pb in gastrointestinal conditions did not exceed 5 - 10 %. Only a few percent more of this metal could be recovered by extraction with phytase and cellulase...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work reports an {{investigation}} {{carried out to}} assess the natural occurrence of ochratoxin A in 168 samples from different fractions obtained during the technological processing of <b>cocoa</b> (shell, nibs, <b>liquor,</b> butter, cake and cocoa powder) and the reduction of ochratoxin A during chocolate manufacture. Ochratoxin A analyses were performed with immunoaffinity columns and detection by high performance liquid chromatography. Concerning the natural ochratoxin A contamination in cocoa by-products, {{the highest levels of}} ochratoxin A were found in the shell, cocoa powder and cocoa cake. The cocoa butter was the least contaminated, showing that ochratoxin A seems to remain in the defatted cocoa solids. Under the technological conditions applied during the manufacture of chocolate in this study and the level of contamination present in the cocoa beans, this experiment demonstrated that 93. 6 % of ochratoxin A present in the beans was reduced during the chocolate producing...|$|R

50|$|Cocoa solids are {{a mixture}} of many {{substances}} remaining after cocoa butter is extracted from cacao beans. When sold as an end product, {{it may also be}} called cocoa powder or cocoa. Cocoa solids are a key ingredient of chocolate, chocolate syrup, and chocolate confections. In contrast, the fatty component of chocolate is cocoa butter. Cocoa butter is 50% to 57% of the weight of cocoa beans and gives chocolate its characteristic melting properties. <b>Cocoa</b> <b>liquor</b> or cocoa mass is a paste of roasted cocoa beans with cocoa butter and solids in their natural proportions. Recipes for chocolate require the addition of extra cocoa butter to <b>cocoa</b> <b>liquor,</b> leading to a cocoa solids surplus and thus a relatively cheap supply of cocoa powder. This contrasts with the earliest European usage of cocoa where, before milk and dark chocolate was popularized, cocoa powder was the primary product and cocoa butter {{was little more than a}} waste product.|$|E
50|$|Cocoa powder {{contains}} several minerals including calcium, copper, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, {{sodium and}} zinc.

50|$|Once the cacao beans {{reach the}} factory, {{they are taken}} to the {{roasting}} room, where the beans are lightly roasted at approximately 235 °F. In this stage, the beans are dried, they lose their shells and they start developing flavor. The winnowing machine separates the shell, or chaff, from the cacao nib. This is achieved by breaking the roasted cacao beans while a ventilator draws the less dense shell away leaving the cacao nibs behind. The nibs are ground in Molinos, Mexican stone mills from Oaxaca, Mexico. The millstones in the Molinos turn the cacao nibs into a graniy paste called <b>cocoa</b> <b>liquor.</b> The cacao liquor is transferred from the Molinos into a mixing tank where it is combined with cane sugar and any other flavor.|$|E
