2500|$|The <b>crucian</b> <b>carp</b> is {{one species}} able to remodel its gill {{filaments}} {{in response to}} hypoxia. Their inter-lamellar cells have high rates of mitotic activity which are influenced by both hypoxia and temperature. [...] In cold (15nbsp&°C) water the <b>crucian</b> <b>carp</b> has more ILCM, but when the temperature is increased to 25nbsp&°C the ILCM is removed, just {{as it would be}} in hypoxic conditions. [...] This same transition in gill morphology occurs in the goldfish when the temperature was raised from 7.5nbsp&°C to 15nbsp&°C. [...] This difference {{may be due to the}} temperature regimes that these fish are typically found in, or there could be an underlying protective mechanism to prevent a loss of ion balance in stressful temperatures. [...] Temperature also affects the speed at which the gills can be remodelled: for example, at 20nbsp&°C in hypoxia, the <b>crucian</b> <b>carp</b> can completely remove its ILCM in 6 hours, whereas at 8nbsp&°C, the same process takes 3–7 days. [...] The ILCM is likely removed by apoptosis, but it is possible that when the fish is faced with the double stress of hypoxia at high temperature, the lamellae may be lost by physical degradation. Covering the gill lamellae may protect species like the <b>crucian</b> <b>carp</b> from parasites and environmental toxins during normoxia by limiting their surface area for inward diffusion while still maintaining oxygen transport due to an extremely high hemoglobin oxygen binding affinity.|$|E

For the purposes of this paper, we observe the frequencyof nest visiting by parents during the chick rearing period. A total of 98 boluses regurgitated by 52 chicks aged 1 day to 11 days after hatching form the sample and are shown to contain 323 food items. A bolus contained mean 3. 8 items andweighs 0. 2 g to 7. 7 g. The most regularly occurring food items recorded are fish (63 %) and insets (33 %). In terms of fish,top mouth minnows (Pseudorasbora parva) and <b>crucian</b> <b>carps</b> (Carassius auratus) are frequently observed. In terms ofinsects, there are mosquitoes (Diptera), instars of dragonfly (Libelluidae), damselflies (Coenagrinonidae) and water bugs(Diplonychus japonicus). Yellow bitterns were also shown to feed on bull frogs (Rana catesbeiana), shrimp (Palaemonidae),and spiders (Araneae). The size of fish in a bolus ranged from 15. 56 mm to 93. 73 mm (mean, 37. 08 mm). The amountof food can be observed to increase with the age of chicks (r = 0. 279, P = 0. 025, N = 64) but parents did not provide largerfish as chicks grew. Parent birds visited nests more frequently when they have a larger brood (F 1, 21 = 14. 529, P = 0. 001).
