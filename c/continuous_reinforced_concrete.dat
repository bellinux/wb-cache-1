40|$|An {{investigation}} {{on the application}} of basalt fibre reinforced polymer (BFRP) and carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) bars as longitudinal reinforcement for simple and continuous concrete slabs is presented. Eight continuously and four simply concrete slabs were constructed and tested to failure. Two continuously supported steel <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs were also tested for comparison purposes. The slabs were classified into two groups according {{to the type of}} FRP bars. All slabs tested were 500 mm in width and 150 mm in depth. The simply supported slabs had a span of 2000 mm, whereas the continuous slabs had two equal spans, each of 2000 mm. Different combinations of under and over FRP (BFRP/CFRP) reinforcement at the top and bottom layers of slabs were investigated. The continuously supported BFRP and CFRP <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs exhibited larger deflections and wider cracks than the counterpart reinforced with steel. The experimental results showed that increasing the bottom mid-span FRP reinforcement of continuous slabs is more effective than the top over middle support FRP reinforcement in improving the load capacity and reducing mid-span deflections. Design guidelines have been validated against experimental results of FRP <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs tested. ISIS¿M 03 ¿ 07 and CSA S 806 - 06 equations reasonably predicted the deflections of the slabs tested. However, ACI 440 ¿ 1 R- 06 underestimated the deflections, overestimated the moment capacities at mid-span and over support sections, and reasonably predicted the load capacity of the continuous slabs tested. On the analytical side, a numerical technique consisting of sectional and longitudinal analyses has been developed to predict the moment¿curvature relationship, moment capacity and load-deflection of FRP <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> members. The numerical technique has been validated against the experimental test results obtained from the current research and those reported in the literature. A parametric study using the numerical technique developed has also been conducted to examine the influence of FRP reinforcement ratio, concrete compressive strength and type of reinforcement on the performance of <b>continuous</b> FRP <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs.

40|$|This thesis has {{investigated}} {{the application of}} CFRP and GFRP bars as longitudinal reinforcement for continuously supported concrete beams. Two series of simply and continuously supported CFRP and GFRP <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beams were tested in flexure. In addition, a continuously supported steel <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beam was tested for comparison purposes. The FRP <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>continuous</b> beams were <b>reinforced</b> {{in a way to}} accomplish three possible reinforcement combinations at the top and bottom layers of such continuous beams. The experimental results revealed that over-reinforcing the bottom layer of either the simply or continuously supported FRP beams is a key factor in controlling the width and propagation of cracks, enhancing the load capacity, and reducing the deflection of such beams. However, <b>continuous</b> <b>concrete</b> beams <b>reinforced</b> with CFRP bars exhibited a remarkable wide crack over the middle support that significantly influenced their behaviour. The ACI 440. 1 R- 06 equations have been validated against experimental results of beams tested. Comparisons between experimental results and those obtained from simplified methods proposed by the ACI 440 Committee show that ACI 440. 1 R- 06 equations can reasonably predict the load capacity and deflection of the simply and continuously supported GFRP <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beams tested. However, The potential capabilities of these equations for predicting the load capacity and deflection of <b>continuous</b> CFRP <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beams have, however, been adversely affected by the de-bonding of top CFRP bars from concrete. An analytical technique, which presents an iterative procedure based on satisfying force equilibrium and deformation compatibility conditions, has been introduced in this research. This technique developed a computer program to investigate flexural behaviour in particular the flexural strength and deflection of simple and continuously supported FRP <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beams. The analytical modelling program has been compared against different prediction methods, namely ACI 440, the bilinear method, mean moment inertia method and Benmokrane¿s method.

The use of <b>continuous</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> slab along the steel truss bridges has still have some {{problems}} in the field such as the occurrence of cracks. Cracks that occur on the concrete slab are required to be repaired, which is mostly done by grouting method. However, the method are still unsuccessful in addition to costly expensive. Study on partial prestressed concrete slab as vehicle decks of steel truss bridge was done. The system used was a partial prestressed concrete segmental slab in one direction which was set transversely the bridge. Two concrete slab specimens were cast which had a length of 7000 mm, a width of 1000 mm and a height of 250 mm, respectively. Symmetrical reinforcement consists of four non-prestressed steel bars and three strands, placed {{on the top and}} bottom sides of the slab. The steel bars have a diameter of 18 mm and the strands have a diameter of 0. 5 inches. Plain steel bars with a diameter of 10 mm were used as stirrups, spacing at 200 mm. The slabs were then tested in the laboratory with a gradual loading increament. At every stage of loading, crack width and strain of steel reinforcement were measured. The test results showed that at the service load condition according to the BMS standard, no cracks was occurred on the concrete slab and the non-prestressed reinforcing steels were still under compression. At maximum load condition, cracks occurred evenly spaced at 85, 5 mm to 112, 5 mm and a maximum crack width was 3. 2 mm. Based on the test results, it can be concluded that such partial prestressed concrete segmental slab was very good to be used as an alternative for the vehicle decks of steel truss bridges...|$|E

An experimental program has been carried out in which two full-scale continuous slabs have been subjected to an imposed relative support settlement and then loaded to failure.

Photogrammetry techniques have been used to measure the displacements; this has been supplemented by the use of displacement transducers and strain gauges at key locations. It was observed that, despite the imposed settlement, the test slabs managed to surpass their ultimate design loads. The failure in each slab was brittle due to fracture of the tensile steel at the sections adjacent to the central support.

On the other hand, the 5 th percentile value of moment redistribution factor could be lower than those specified by the code.
