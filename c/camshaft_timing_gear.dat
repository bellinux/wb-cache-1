5000|$|A {{short block}} is an engine {{sub-assembly}} comprising {{the portion of}} the cylinder block below the head gasket but above the oil pan. An in-block cam engine includes the <b>camshaft,</b> <b>timing</b> <b>gear,</b> and any balance shafts. Overhead cam engines don't include those parts.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, the Tech IV engine {{has proved}} to be a {{reliable}} workhorse for owners when not pushed to its limits. All 1978-1990 Iron Duke L-4's are outfitted with a micarta camshaft gear that meshes directly with a steel gear on the crankshaft (no timing chain), a design also used by the Chevrolet inline six. 1991-92 VIN R and U engines received a timing chain. The timing gear has a tendency to crumble a tooth anytime after 80,000 miles. The cam gear simply shears a tooth at startup and the engine won't start; because of the non-interference design of the engine, no further damage occurs. When the cam gear loses a tooth, the camshaft AND distributor stop rotating during engine cranking. Replacing the gear requires heating the new gear in hot oil and quickly installing it for a shrink(interference) fit on the cam stub. One upgrade is the use of the aluminum <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing</b> <b>gear</b> from a Chevrolet 250 inline six with the Iron Duke's crankshaft timing gear.|$|E

50|$|The {{electric}} motor in the actuator spins {{together with the}} intake camshaft as the engine runs. To maintain <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing,</b> the actuator motor will operate {{at the same speed}} as the camshaft. To advance the <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing,</b> the actuator motor will rotate slightly faster than the camshaft speed. To retard <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing,</b> the actuator motor will rotate slightly slower than camshaft speed. The speed difference between the actuator motor and <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing</b> is used to operate a mechanism that varies the <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing.</b> The benefit of the electric actuation is enhanced response and accuracy at low engine speeds and at lower temperatures as well as a greater total range of adjustment. The combination of these factors allows more precise control, resulting in an improvement of both fuel economy, engine output and emissions performance.|$|R

50|$|VVT-iE (Variable Valve Timing - {{intelligent}} by Electric motor) is {{a version}} of Dual VVT-i that uses an electrically operated actuator to adjust and maintain intake <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing.</b> The exhaust <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing</b> is still controlled using a hydraulic actuator. This form of variable valve timing technology was developed initially for Lexus vehicles. This system was first introduced on the 2007MY Lexus LS 460 as 1UR engine.|$|R

5000|$|The Fiat V8 had a 70 degree V configuration, {{displaced}} 1,996 cc and {{was fitted}} with two twin-choke Weber 36 DCF 3 carburettors. In its first iteration (type 104.000) the engine had a compression ratio of 8.5:1 and produced [...] at 5,600 rpm, giving the car {{a top speed}} of 190 km/h. Improved type 104.003 had different <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing</b> for [...] at 6,000 rpm; finally type 104.006 with a 8.75:1 compression ratio, revised <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing</b> and fuel system put out [...] at 6,600 rpm.The engine was connected to a four speed gearbox. The car had independent suspension all round and drum brakes on all four wheels.|$|R
50|$|In 1913, the 5.6 liter and 3 liter engines {{were further}} {{developed}} with <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing,</b> previously carried by shaft and bevel, now {{carried out by}} a cascade of gears, and lubrication was amended by adding a dry sump.|$|R
50|$|For the FG MkI, the 5.4 {{was further}} tuned to produce 315 kW (428 PS; 422 bhp) and 551 N·m (406 lb·ft). FPV {{achieved}} this {{through a new}} camshaft profile, new <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing,</b> strengthened piston assembly and a higher compression ratio (10.5:1 to 10.8:1).|$|R
50|$|The four {{camshafts}} incorporate VCT (variable <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing).</b> VCT {{allows the}} timing of the intake and exhaust valves to be adjusted independently of each other. The VCT system is controlled by the Bosch ECM (engine control module) using information from CMP (camshaft position) sensors.|$|R
5000|$|This {{update of}} the S14B23 {{produced}} , or [...] if {{equipped with a}} catalytic converter. Changes include a revised intake camshaft profile and modified exhaust <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing,</b> increased compression, and a more efficient cylinder head intake port design. Larger diameter exhaust header tubes are used.|$|R
50|$|Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) is an {{automobile}} {{variable valve timing}} technology developed by Ford. It allows for more optimum engine performance, reduced emissions, and increased fuel efficiency compared to engines with fixed camshafts. It uses electronically controlled hydraulic valves that direct high pressure engine oil into the camshaft phaser cavity. These oil control solenoids are bolted into the cylinder heads towards {{the front of the}} engine near the camshaft phasers. The powertrain control module (PCM) transmits a signal to the solenoids to move a valve spool that regulates the flow of oil to the phaser cavity. The phaser cavity changes the valve timing by rotating the camshaft slightly from its initial orientation, which results in the <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing</b> being advanced or retarded. The PCM adjusts the <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing</b> depending on factors such as engine load and RPM.|$|R

50|$|In 2002, Ford {{introduced}} a new 3-valve SOHC cylinder head with variable <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing</b> (VCT), improving power and torque over the previous 2-valve SOHC version. The 3-valve cylinder head was first used on the 2002 Ford Fairmont 5.4 L Barra 220 engine in Australia. The 3-valve 5.4 L {{was introduced to the}} North American market in the redesigned 2004 Ford F-150.|$|R
50|$|Volkswagen use a {{variator}} {{system with}} two variators, {{one for each}} camshaft. Like the Alfa Romeo system, these are electrically-controlled hydraulic units, mounted in the <b>camshaft's</b> <b>timing</b> belt pulley. These systems are fitted to the Volkswagen VR5 and VR6 engines, and also to the W8 and W12 engines. The multiple-bank W engines have four variators in total, one for each camshaft.|$|R
5000|$|Production {{began in}} February 1995 and lasted until June 2005, {{with a brief}} pause, due to the {{bankruptcy}} of coachbuilder Maggiora. The Barchetta {{was based on the}} chassis of the Mark 1 Fiat Punto. The Barchetta has 1,747 cc DOHC petrol engine fitted with variable <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing,</b> used {{for the first time in}} a Fiat production car, after being patented in 1970.|$|R

5000|$|In 1992 the DDEC III {{system was}} {{introduced}} and {{was available in}} horsepower ratings up to , and {{this was due to}} revised <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing,</b> and other improvements.

Again, encouraging operators to take advantage of reduced fuel consumption.|$|R
50|$|Chrysler {{has made}} various {{revisions}} to the 5.7 L for the 2009 model year. The first for all applications is what Chrysler calls Variable Camshaft Timing or VCT. VCT (which is essentially variable valve timing) uses an oil control valve which controls oil flow to a unique camshaft sprocket which contains a phasing device, which depending on {{the operation of the}} oil control valve either advances or retards <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For the 2005 to 2010 {{production}} years, {{the base}} model was {{powered by a}} [...] cast-iron block 4.0 L SOHC V6, while the GT used an aluminum block 4.6 L SOHC 3-valve Modular V8 with variable <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing</b> (VCT) that produced [...] Base models had a Tremec T5 5-speed manual transmission with Ford's 5R55S 5-speed automatic being optional.
