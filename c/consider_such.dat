5|$|By 1870, the District's {{population}} had grown 75% {{from the previous}} census to nearly 132,000 residents. Despite the city's growth, Washington still had dirt roads and lacked basic sanitation. Some members of Congress suggested moving the capital further west, but President Ulysses S.

5|$|All kanyas lack {{mothers in}} their life. Ahalya, Tara, Mandodari, Sita and Draupadi have supernatural births, while Kunti is adopted at birth and {{separated}} from a mother. Though all of kanyas {{are described as}} mothers, except Kunti, no kanya's motherhood is emphasized in their tales. Another common element {{is the theme of}} loss in their legends. Ahalya is cursed and abandoned by her family. Tara loses her husband, Draupadi her sons and Mandodari her husband, sons and kin in war. Each of them suffers a tragedy and used by men, but battles on with life and society. They are considered by Mr Pradip Bhattacharya as victims of patriarchal myth-making, however orthodox Hindus usually oppose such theoretical speculation and <b>consider</b> <b>such</b> speculation distorting the message. A free-spirited Ahalya is punished for her adultery. Druapadi, who challenges and mocks even her husbands, has her dignity repeatedly violated by men.|$|E
5|$|Count Geoffrey died in 1151 before finalizing the {{division}} of his realm between Henry and Henry's younger brother Geoffrey, who would have inherited Anjou. According to William of Newburgh, who wrote in the 1190s, Count Geoffrey decided that Henry would receive England and Anjou {{for as long as}} he needed the resources for the conflict against Stephen. Count Geoffrey instructed that his body should not be buried until Henry swore an oath that the young Geoffrey would receive Anjou when England and Normandy were secured. W. L. Warren cast doubt on this account on the grounds that it was written later based on a single contemporary source, it would be questionable that either Geoffrey or Henry would <b>consider</b> <b>such</b> an oath binding and it would break the inheritance practice of the time. The young Geoffrey died in 1158, before receiving Anjou, but he had become count of Nantes when the citizens of Nantes rebelled against their ruler. Henry had supported the rebellion.|$|E

5|$|Longstreet's {{attack was}} delayed, however, because he {{first had to}} wait for his final brigade (Evander M. Law's, Hood's division) to arrive, and then he was forced to march on a long, {{circuitous}} route that could not be seen by Union Army Signal Corps observers on Little Round Top. It was 4 p.m. by the time his two divisions reached their jumping off points, and then he and his generals were astonished to find the III Corps planted directly in front of them on the Emmitsburg Road. Hood argued with Longstreet that this new situation demanded a change in tactics; he wanted to swing around, below and behind, Round Top and hit the Union Army in the rear. Longstreet, however, refused to <b>consider</b> <b>such</b> a modification to Lee's order.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} {{national}} assembly of theologians to advise Parliament on further church reforms was first presented to the House of Commons in 1641. Such a proposal was {{also included in the}} Grand Remonstrance, a list of grievances which Parliament presented to Charles on 1December that year. Charles responded on 23December that the church required no reforms. Undeterred, Parliament passed three bills in 1642 appointing an assembly and stipulating that its members would be chosen by Parliament. Charles, whose royal assent was required for the bills to become law, was only willing to <b>consider</b> <b>such</b> an assembly if the members were chosen by the clergy. This was the practice for selection of members of Convocation, the assembly of clergy of the Church of England.|$|E

25|$|Homosexual {{behavior}} is a ground for divorce, {{an act of}} sexual misconduct punishable as a crime in Alabama, a crime against nature, an inherent evil, and an act so heinous that it defies one's ability to describe it. That is enough under the law to allow a court to <b>consider</b> <b>such</b> activity harmful to a child. To declare that homosexuality is harmful {{is not to make}} new law but to reaffirm the old; {{to say that it is}} not harmful is to experiment with people's lives, particularly the lives of children.|$|E

In its first five years, approximately $3.8 million was collected. Funds have been used for city beautification and maintenance projects. This has led other cities in the area to also <b>consider</b> <b>such</b> a fee. Forbes has identified Brownsville as one of 12 metropolitan areas in the U.S. with the cleanest air; Laredo was the only other Texas metropolitan area to be among the 12.|$|E

25|$|There is no Belarusian {{law that}} refers {{specifically}} to perpetrators of crimes motivated by homophobia. In the Criminal Code, homosexuals are only singled {{out when they}} are the “subjects” of a crime (e.g., when they are the perpetrators), and not when they are “objects” (e.g., victims of a crime). Judicial and police organs do not express any eagerness to collect evidence about the homophobic motives of those who perpetrate crimes. Judges are not obliged to <b>consider</b> <b>such</b> motives as aggravating the circumstances of guilt, or to impose more severe punishments when homophobic motives are present. LGBT people are in danger to face discrimination and violence.|$|E
25|$|During the Chase Court-era, Congress had {{stripped}} the Court {{of the authority}} to hear appeals from habeas petitions in the circuit courts. In Ex parte Royall (1884), the Waite Court dismissed such an appeal, holding that the jurisdiction had never been restored. But, the Court did retain jurisdiction over habeas appeals in a limited subset of cases. For example, in Wales v. Whitney (1885), the Court affirmed the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia's denial of a habeas petition on the meits, holding {{that it had no}} power to review a navy courts martial. Similarly, in Roberts v. Reilly (1885), the Court affirmed a denial of habeas corpus on the merits, but held that it had jurisdiction to <b>consider</b> <b>such</b> appeals under the Extradition Act.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{sessions}} {{depends on the}} situation, but the average is 5-20 sessions. A family therapist usually meets {{several members of the}} family at the same time. This has the advantage of making differences between the ways family members perceive mutual relations as well as interaction patterns in the session apparent both for the therapist and the family. These patterns frequently mirror habitual interaction patterns at home, even though the therapist is now incorporated into the family system. Therapy interventions usually focus on relationship patterns rather than on analyzing impulses of the unconscious mind or early childhood trauma of individuals as a Freudian therapist would do - although some schools of family therapy, for example psychodynamic and intergenerational, do <b>consider</b> <b>such</b> individual and historical factors (thus embracing both linear and circular causation) and they may use instruments such as the genogram to help to elucidate the patterns of relationship across generations.|$|E

They noted that for example, {{it is easier to}} account for the cost of definite levels of subsidies to specified numbers of people than account for savings from preventive healthcare, and that the CBO had a track record of overestimating costs and underestimating savings of health legislation; stating, [...] "innovations in the delivery of medical care, like greater use of electronic medical records and financial incentives for more coordination of care among doctors, would produce substantial savings while also slowing the relentless climb of medical expenses... But the CBO would not <b>consider</b> <b>such</b> savings in its calculations, because the innovations hadn't really been tried on such large scale or in concert with one another—and that meant there wasn't much hard data to prove the savings would materialize." ...|$|E
500|$|In December, King Frederick II of Prussia {{invaded the}} Duchy of Silesia and {{requested}} that Maria Theresa cede it, threatening {{to join her}} enemies if she refused. Maria Theresa decided {{to fight for the}} mineral-rich province. Frederick even offered a compromise: he would defend Maria Theresa's rights if she agreed to cede to him at least a part of Silesia. Francis Stephen was inclined to <b>consider</b> <b>such</b> an arrangement, but the Queen and her advisers were not, fearing that any violation of the Pragmatic Sanction would invalidate the entire document. Maria Theresa's firmness soon assured Francis Stephen that they should fight for Silesia, and she was confident that she would retain [...] "the jewel of the House of Austria".
