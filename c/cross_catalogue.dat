The queries tested are those expected from the astronomy community: general database queries, cone searches, neighbour finding and <b>cross</b> matching. The <b>catalogue</b> preparation, sql query formulation and database performance is presented. Most of the general queries perform adequately when appropriate indexes {{are present in the}} database. Each system performs well for cone search queries when the Hierarchical Triangular Mesh spatial index is used. Neighbour finding and cross matching are not well supported in a database environment when compared to software specifically developed to solve these problems...|$|R

His legacy remains {{today in the}} Leighton Library (or Bibliotheca Leightoniana), which is the oldest purpose built library in Scotland. It {{contains}} a collection of around 4000 volumes and 78 manuscripts from the 16th to the 19th century, and is founded on the personal collection of Leighton, who bequeathed some 1500 books to Dunblane Cathedral. A library building was erected between 1684 and 1688 in order to house the books {{for the use of}} the local clergy. From 1734 the library became one of the first subscription libraries in Scotland. The collection covers a variety of subject areas, including history and politics (particularly 17th century), theology, medicine, travel, and language. Some of the collection was originally owned by Newbattle and was stored at the Old Manse, but it is now held in its entirety at The <b>Cross,</b> Dunblane.

40|$|This poster {{provides}} an overview of the ongoing rescue of valuable digital collections that had been taken down and consequently lost to general access. The University of Glasgow was home to the Arts and Humanities Data Service Performing Arts (AHDS Performing Arts) [1], one of the five arts and humanities data centres that constitute the Arts and Humanities Data Service (AHDS). Since 1996 AHDS supported the creation, curation, preservation and reuse of digital materials for the UK Arts and Humanities research and teaching community. AHDS Performing Arts, based in Glasgow, supported research, learning and teaching in music, dance, theatre, radio, film, television, and performance for thirteen years. Working with the AHDS Executive, relevant performing arts collections have been ingested, documented, preserved, and where possible made available via the AHDS <b>Cross</b> Search <b>Catalogue</b> and Website to researchers, practitioners, and the general public. Furthermore strong relationships were developed with research and teaching community upon a scoping study investigating user needs [2]. In 2007 the co-funders of the AHDS - Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) for the UK and the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) - withdrew their funding. A detailed risk assessment report was produced in response to the withdrawal of core funding [3], but to no avail. When the AHDS funding stopped, online access to these cultural resources eventually became discontinued [4]. In 2010, the School of Culture and Creative Arts at the University of Glasgow joined the EU-funded ECLAP project to ensure that at least part of these resources could be accessible for the long term by scholars and practitioners in the performing arts arena, and by the general public. Below we briefly describe the ECLAP project, the AHDS Performing Arts collections progressively available through it and some thoughts on providing preservation through access for this type of digital cultural resources...|$|R

As a reminder of the celebration, they would construct a cross at some relevant place of the village, like the one that can be found in Montargull.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{extension}} to our XMM-Newton X-ray source catalogue of M 31, containing 39 newly found sources. In order to classify and identify {{more of the}} sources we search for X-ray time variability in XMM-Newton archival data of the M 31 centre field. As a source list we used our extended catalogue based on observations covering the time span from June 2000 to July 2004. We then determined the flux or at least an upper limit at the source positions for each observation. Deriving the flux ratios for the different observations and searching for the maximum flux difference we determined variability factors. We also calculated {{the significance of the}} flux ratios. Using hardness ratios, X-ray variability and <b>cross</b> correlations with <b>catalogues</b> in the X-ray, optical, infrared and radio regimes, we detected three super soft source candidates, one supernova remnant and six supernova remnant candidates, one globular cluster candidate, three X-ray binaries and four X-ray binary candidates. Additionally we identified one foreground star candidate and classified fifteen sources with hard spectra, which may either be X-ray binaries or Crab-like supernova remnants in M 31 or background active galactic nuclei. The remaining five sources stay unidentified or without classification. Based on the time variability results we suggest six sources, which were formerly classified as "hard", to be X-ray binary candidates. The classification of one other source (XMMM 31 J 004236. 7 + 411349) as a supernova remnant, has to be rejected due to the distinct time variability we found. We now classify this source as a foreground star. Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in A&...|$|R

Our XMM-Newton EPIC survey combines archival observations with observations taken between June 2006 and February 2008. The main goal of the paper is a study of the X-ray source population of M 31.

Many of the 25 supernova remnants (SNRs) and 31 SNR candidates lie within the 10 kpc dust ring and other star forming regions in M 31; this connection between SNRs and star forming regions implies that most of the remnants originate in type II supernovae. The brightest sources in X-rays in M 31 belong to the class of X-ray binaries (XRBs). Ten low mass XRBs (LMXBs) and 26 LMXB candidates were identified based on their temporal variability. In addition 36 LMXBs and 17 LMXB candidates were identified due to correlations with globular clusters and globular cluster candidates. From optical and X-ray colour-colour diagrams, possible high mass XRB (HMXB) candidates were selected. Two of these candidates have an X-ray spectrum as is expected for an HMXB containing a neutron star primary. Conclusions. While our survey has greatly improved our understanding of the X-ray source populations in M 31, at this point 65 % of the sources can still only be classified as "hard" sources. Deeper observations in X-ray and at other wavelengths would help classify these sources. ABRIDGEDComment: 51 pages, 36 figures, submitted to A&...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the items}} that came to the University of Glasgow Library in 1953 from Robert O. Dougan were twenty-three boxes of glass negatives. While much {{work has been done}} on other items that came from Dougan, which {{includes}} much outstanding material of early Scottish photography, little has been done with the glass negatives. These glass negatives are the purpose of this thesis and to provide the basic context there is a description of the life and career of Robert O. Dougan and his collecting of historic photographic material and how the Dougan Collection came to the University of Glasgow Library. The twenty-three boxes of glass negatives were bought by Dougan from Rock House, Edinburgh, in the 1940 s. This had been the studio of the pioneering Scottish Photographers, David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson in the 1840 s and had continued to be used by successive photographers until the 1940 s. Much of what comprises the Dougan Collection came from Rock House. To provide the historical context, the use of Rock House as a photographic studio, from Hill and Adamson’s time to the last main photographer there, Francis Caird Inglis, will be described. The glass negatives also link Hill and Adamson and Inglis because it was the latter who made them and most of the negatives are copies of Hill and Adamson photographs. There will be a full catalogue of the total of 328 glass negatives with positive images of each {{for the first time and}} the content analysed. The <b>catalogue</b> <b>cross</b> references the Hill and Adamson images to major collections of their work and in particular the University of Glasgow Library and the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. The circumstances of why and when the negatives were made and for what purpose will be investigated and there will be an indication of the sources of the photographs copied in the glass negatives. In conclusion any images that may only be known to survive because they were copied in the glass negatives will be highlighted...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{properties}} of 'peculiar' early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the local Universe that show (faint) morphological signatures of recent interactions such as tidal tails, shells and dust lanes. Standard-depth (??? 51 -s exposure) multicolour galaxy images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) are combined with the significantly (??? 2 mag) deeper monochromatic images from the public SDSS Stripe 82 to extract, through careful visual inspection, a robust sample of nearby (z < 0. 05), luminous (M <- 20. 5) ETGs, including a subset of ??? 70 peculiar systems. ??? 18 per cent of ETGs exhibit signs of disturbed morphologies (e. g. shells), while ??? 7 per cent show evidence of dust lanes and patches. An analysis of optical emission-line ratios indicates that the fraction of peculiar ETGs that are Seyferts or LINERs (19. 4 per cent) is twice the corresponding values in their relaxed counterparts (10. 1 per cent). LINER-like emission is the dominant type of nebular activity in all ETG classes, plausibly driven by stellar photoionization associated with recent star formation. An analysis of ultraviolet-optical colours indicates that, regardless of the luminosity range being considered, the fraction of peculiar ETGs that have experienced star formation in the last Gyr is a factor of ??? 1. 5 higher than that in their relaxed counterparts. The spectrophotometric results strongly suggest that the interactions that produce the morphological peculiarities also induce low-level recent star formation which, based on the recent literature, are likely to contribute a few per cent of the stellar mass over the last ??? 1 Gyr. Peculiar ETGs preferentially inhabit low-density environments (outskirts of clusters, groups or the field), either due to high peculiar velocities in clusters making merging unlikely or because shell systems are disrupted through frequent interactions within a cluster <b>crossing</b> time.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} analysis of a large and deep XMM-Newton survey of the second large Local Group spiral galaxy M 31. The survey observations, taken between June 2006 and February 2008, together with re-analysed archival observations from June 2000 to July 2004 cover, for the first time, the whole D 25 ellipse of M 31 with XMM-Newton down to a limiting luminosity of ~ 10 ^ 35 erg/s in the 0. 2 - 4. 5 keV band. The main goal of the thesis was {{a study of the}} different source populations of M 31 that can be observed in X-rays. Therefore a catalogue was created, which contains all 1948 sources detected in the 0. 2 - 12. 0 keV range. 961 of these sources were detected in X-rays for the first time. Source classification and identification was based on X-ray hardness ratios, spatial extent of the sources, and by <b>cross</b> correlating with <b>catalogues</b> in the X-ray, optical, infrared and radio wavelengths. An additional classification criterion was the long-term temporal variability of the sources in X-rays. This variability allows us to distinguish between X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. Furthermore, supernova remnant classifications of previous studies that did not use long-term variability as a classification criterion, could be validated. Including previous Chandra and ROSAT observations in the long-term variability study allowed me to detect additional transient or at least highly variable sources, which are good candidates for being X-ray binaries. Fourteen of the 40 supersoft source (SSS) candidates correlated with optical novae and therefore can be considered the supersoft emission of the optical novae. Among them is the first nova/SSS detected in a globular cluster of M 31. Correlations with previous ROSAT and Chandra studies revealed that only three SSSs are visible for at least one decade. This result underlines the strong long-term variability found for the class of SSSs. In addition the correlations demonstrated that strict selection criteria have to be applied to securely select SSSs. An investigation of the spatial distribution of the 25 supernova remnants (SNRs) and 37 SNR candidates showed that many of these sources are consistent with the location of the 10 kpc dust ring and other star forming regions in M 31. This connection between SNRs and star forming regions implies that most of the remnants are from type II supernovae. The brightest sources of M 31 belong to the class of X-ray binaries (XRBs). Ten low mass XRBs (LMXBs) and 26 LMXB candidates were identified based on their temporal variability. In addition 36 LMXBs and 17 LMXB candidates were identified due to correlations with globular clusters and globular cluster candidates. From the LMXBs located in globular clusters one is a black hole candidate and another a neutron star candidate. From optical and X-ray colour-colour diagrams, possible high mass XRB (HMXB) candidates were selected. Two of these candidates have an X-ray spectrum as is expected for an HMXB containing a neutron star primary. To investigate the logN-logS relations of sources in the field of M 31, a catalogue of sources detected in the 2. 0 - 10. 0 keV energy range was created. The slope of the logN-logS relation for the whole galaxy is consistent with the expectation for spiral galaxies (Colbert et al. 2004). Subtracting the background logN-logS relation, the region beyond the D 25 ellipse still contains about 13 sources/deg^ 2 of M 31 with fluxes above the completeness limit of ~ 3. 2 x 10 ^{- 14 } erg/cm^ 2 /s (~ 2. 3 x 10 ^ 36 erg/s at the distance of M 31). The radial dependence of the source distribution in M 31 's disc can be well fitted with an exponential profile, for limiting fluxes of ~ 3. 2 x 10 ^{- 14 } erg/cm^ 2 /s and 10 ^{- 13 } erg/cm^ 2 /s (~ 7. 3 x 10 ^ 36 erg/s). About 60 % of all sources with fluxes above 3. 2 x 10 ^{- 14 } erg/cm^ 2 /s are background sources. While the contribution of background sources lies at ~ 20 % in the inner disc region, the fraction increases to >~ 80 % in the outer areas of M 31. For the dust ring region, the slope of the logN-logS relation as well as the number of sources and their dependence on the star forming rate were consistent with the universal logN-logS relation predicted from theoretical considerations of HMXBs (Grimm et al. 2003). These findings propose that the dust ring region contains a population of HMXBs. A comparison of the number of X-ray binaries (XRBs) obtained from the logN-logS study to the ones listed in the source catalogue showed that many XRBs detected in the logN-logS study with fluxes between 10 ^{- 13 } erg/cm^ 2 /s and 3. 2 x 10 ^{- 14 } erg/cm^ 2 /s, or (independent from the flux) those XRBs located in the inner disc of M 31, remain without XRB classification in the source catalogue. The results presented in this thesis gave us deeper insights in the properties of the population of X-ray sources in M 31. Nevertheless, about 65 % of all sources detected in the field of M 31 can be classified as ``hard" sources only, i. e. {{it is not possible to}} decide whether these sources are X-ray binaries or Crab-like supernova remnants in M 31, or active galactic nuclei. Deeper observations in the X-ray and at other wavelengths are needed to classify these sources...|$|R
