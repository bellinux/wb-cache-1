The film, originally titled Mayil, is set in rural Tamil Nadu and is Rajinikanth's first <b>colour</b> <b>film.</b> 16 Vayathinile is the first Tamil film to be shot completely outdoors; Tamil films were primarily filmed in Chennai studios.|$|E
5|$|Thiruvilaiyadal {{was entirely}} {{shot in a}} {{specially}} erected set at Vasu Studios in Madras (now Chennai). It was filmed in Eastmancolor and was Nagarajan's first <b>colour</b> <b>film.</b> The scenes featuring the conversations between Shiva and Dharumi were not scripted by Nagarajan but were improvised during filming by Nagesh and Ganesan.|$|E
5|$|A Ghost Story for Christmas is {{a strand}} of annual British short {{television}} films originally broadcast on BBC One between 1971 and 1978, and revived in 2005 on BBC Four. With one exception, the original instalments were directed by Lawrence Gordon Clark and the films were all shot on 16mm <b>colour</b> <b>film.</b> The remit behind the series {{was to provide a}} television adaptation of a classic ghost story, in line with the oral tradition of telling supernatural tales at Christmas.|$|E

5|$|Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum was {{released}} on 14 January 1956 during the festive occasion of Thai Pongal. It was a milestone in Ramachandran's career and became a success {{at the box office}} which was largely attributed to it being the first full-length <b>colour</b> <b>film</b> in South India. The songs also attained popularity. The film was later dubbed in Telugu as Ali Baba 40 Dongalu.|$|E
5|$|The {{documentary}} {{was shot}} on 16mm <b>colour</b> <b>film</b> by cameraman John McGlashan, {{who had also}} worked on the BBC's M.R. James series of adaptations A Ghost Story for Christmas, of which the early installments were entirely filmed in Norfolk (Betjeman was a fan of Jamesian ghost stories, and often read them to the crew while travelling to locations). McGlashan was also a part-time priest for a Liberal Catholic church, {{and was able to}} bring to the production additional knowledge of the Sacraments.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest first {{appeared}} on the screen in 1905. Charles Urban filmed the opening storm sequence of Herbert Beerbohm Tree's version at Her Majesty's Theatre for a -minute flicker, whose individual frames were hand-tinted, long before the invention of <b>colour</b> <b>film.</b> In 1908, Percy Stowe directed a Tempest running a little over ten minutes, which is now a part of the British Film Institute's compilation Silent Shakespeare. Much of its action takes place on Prospero's island before the storm which opens Shakespeare's play. At least two other silent versions, one from 1911 by Edwin Thanhouser, are known to have existed, but have been lost. The plot was adapted for the Western Yellow Sky, directed by William A. Wellman, in 1946.|$|E

The clip was first broadcast in black and white on BBC-TV's Top of the Pops on 2 June. The 20 May promo clip was included in the Beatles' 2015 video compilation 1, and both the 19 May <b>colour</b> <b>film</b> and the 20 May film were included in the three-disc versions of the compilation, titled 1+.|$|E

25|$|Thomas relaunched {{the ailing}} Pathé Gazette as Pathé News, began hiring new cameramen and pioneered {{the switch to}} <b>colour</b> <b>film.</b> He also {{arranged}} for the Pathé archives, then of little or no intrinsic value to the company, to be indexed and properly preserved for future use.|$|E
25|$|The Early Bird (1965), {{his first}} <b>colour</b> <b>film,</b> had Wisdom as a milkman.

25|$|On 29 May 1938, South African tourist G. E. Taylor filmed {{something}} in the loch for three minutes on 16mm <b>colour</b> <b>film.</b> The film was obtained by popular science writer Maurice Burton, who did not show it to other researchers. A single frame was published in his 1961 book, The Elusive Monster. His analysis concluded it was a floating object, not an animal.|$|E
50|$|The S3 {{can produce}} images in JPEG format with {{the option of}} three {{rendering}} tonalities. Two of these ('F1' and 'F2') are generally regarded to emulate the look of Fujifilm <b>colour</b> <b>films.</b> The third ('Standard') gives a more neutral image and may also be set for B&W (monochrome) capture.|$|R
50|$|Just {{before they}} ceased operations, both MFP and Cathay-Keris {{produced}} three <b>colour</b> <b>films</b> each. Shaw Brothers’ produced Ribut (Storm), Hang Tuah and Raja Bersiong (The Fanged King). The latter, a legend {{from the state}} of Kedah, was written by Malaysia’s first Prime Minister, the late Tunku Abdul Rahman.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{black and white}} films, XP2 Super can be {{processed}} in the same chemicals as <b>colour</b> print <b>film</b> (<b>colour</b> C41 Process). It produces a monochrome (black & white) negative, despite the development process.|$|R
25|$|Swarcliffe School, on Swarcliffe Drive, was {{an infant}} (5to8-years-old) and junior school (8to11-years-old), but the junior section was {{demolished}} in the2000s, and the school renamed Swarcliffe Primary School and Nursery. In the early1960s, Oxfam made a <b>colour</b> <b>film</b> for its21st anniversary about the pupils of Swarcliffe School, called Swarcliffe Junior School Presents Our Daily Bread, which featured pupils creating a stand for Leeds' Freedom From Hunger exhibition.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Cathay-Keris Films was formed. The studio, {{situated}} in out in East Coast Road, produced its own {{films in the}} Malay. These were former barracks occupied by the Japanese and were converted into processing labs, sound studios, offices and even a canteen. That year, Cathay-Keris produced Singapore's first <b>colour</b> <b>film,</b> Buloh Perindu. More than 100 films were made at Cathay Keris's studios between 1953 and 1973 including five Pontianak movies; Pontianak (1957), Dendam Pontianak (1957), Sumpah Pontianak (1958), Pontianak Kembali (1963) & Pontianak Gua Musang (1964). Sadly the first two classic Pontianak films are long lost.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, {{in collaboration}} with Wellington film-maker Costa Botes, Jackson co-directed the mockumentary Forgotten Silver (1995). This ambitious made-for-television piece {{told the story of}} New Zealand film pioneer Colin McKenzie, who had supposedly invented <b>colour</b> <b>film</b> and 'talkies', and attempted an epic film of Salome before being forgotten by the world. Though the programme played in a slot normally reserved for drama, no other warning was given that it was fictionalised and many viewers were outraged at discovering Colin McKenzie had never existed. The number of people who believed the increasingly improbable story provides testimony to Jackson and Botes' skill at playing on New Zealand's national myth of a nation of innovators and forgotten trail-blazers.|$|E
50|$|A {{compilation}} of <b>colour</b> <b>filmed</b> segments {{from the first}} series was edited into an 85-minute feature The Very Best of The Aunty Jack Show which was screened at the 1973 Montreux Film Festival. It was not seen by Australian audiences until it was broadcast on ABC television on 26 January 1991.|$|R
50|$|Parole {{officers}} {{and their clients}} were featured characters in this <b>colour</b> <b>filmed</b> series. Its working title was The Double Bind, reflecting the dual responsibilities of parole officers to both former prisoners and the legal system. The production was based on The Clients, a pilot half-hour series broadcast locally in Vancouver.|$|R
50|$|The film is {{particularly}} {{known for its}} cinematography, particularly its use of colour. In the introduction for The Criterion Collection DVD of Jean Renoir's The River, Martin Scorsese, who has long championed Powell and Pressburger's works, considers The Red Shoes and The River to be the two most beautiful <b>colour</b> <b>films.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{series was}} {{transmitted}} {{in black and}} white {{for the majority of the}} 1960s. Preparations were made to film episode 923, to be transmitted Wednesday 29 October 1969, in colour. This instalment featured the street's residents on a coach trip to the Lake District. In the end, suitable <b>colour</b> <b>film</b> stock for the cameras could not be found and the footage was shot {{in black and white}}. The following episode, transmitted Monday 3 November, was videotaped in colour but featured black and white film inserts and title sequence. Like BBC1, the ITV network was officially broadcast in black and white at this point (though programmes were actually broadcast in colour as early as July that year for colour transmission testing and adjustment) so the episode was seen by most in black and white.|$|E

500|$|Created {{with the}} {{approval}} of the Bishop of Norwich, Maurice Wood, the 49-minute film was shot on location in Norfolk and parts of Suffolk throughout the spring of 1974 on 16mm <b>colour</b> <b>film</b> by cameraman John McGlashan. For the film, John Betjeman wrote an original poetic commentary consisting of blank verse, free verse, and prose and he appeared on-screen in several segments to describe features of ecclesiastical buildings and to reminisce about his lifelong [...] "passion for churches".|$|E

40|$|Normal and {{abnormal}} fundi were photographed {{at various}} magnifications in {{one and the}} same fundus camera, with and without 'red-free' filters and various types of black-and-white and <b>colour</b> <b>films.</b> <b>Colour</b> diapositive <b>films</b> were copied on various black-and-white negative films, with and without filters. The final negatives were evaluated under magnification with regard to resolution and contrast of detail in the nerve fibre layer. Complementary information was obtained by means of conventional resolution measurements at high and low contrast levels. The best overall results were obtained by copying colour slides obtained in unfiltered light on a new high-contrast black-and-white film (Kodak Technical Pan), with a Wratten No. 65 A filter. This simple technique produced negatives with a good definition of the nerve fibre layer, suitable as final records...|$|R
50|$|Silent <b>colour</b> <b>films</b> shot by Eva Braun {{survived the}} war and showed Hitler and his guests {{relaxing}} at the Berghof. In 2006, computer lip reading software identified several parts of their conversations.
