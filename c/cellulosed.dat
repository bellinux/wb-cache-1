40|$|The paper {{emphasizes}} {{the most important}} histo-anatomical aspects of Sedum telephium L. ssp. maximum (L.) Krock. from Crassulaceae family. Its root, of secondary structure, is protected by a quite thin peridermis. The central cylinder bears few vascular bundles. Generally, the vascular strands are irregularly distributed throughout the water-storage tissue. The rhizome presents cortical amiliferous parenchyma, formed by cells with thin and <b>cellulosed</b> walls. The fleshy aspect of the stem comes from a well developed parenchymatic tissue which occurs in the cortex and pith. The leaves are water storing and do not present a typical palisade tissue; their entire surface presents anyzocitic stomata; the foliar limb is amphistomatic and displays a bifacial-isofacial structure, with normal dorsiventrality...|$|E
40|$|The {{anatomical}} and the histochemical {{study of}} the, young, adult rachides and leaflets of Chamaerops humilis L. region of Tlemcen and Oranian littoral {{shows that the}} general structure {{is similar to that}} of the majority of Arecacae. This species presents <b>cellulosed</b> and lignified cell walls. Conyferyls lignins miss in the cell walls of abaxial fibres of the rachides and leaflets, also the inner bundle-sheath fibres are deprived of conyferyls lignins. On the other hand, syringyls lignins are abundant in tissues of the rachides and the leaflets of the two regions. The abaxial fibres of the leaflets of Tlemcen are continued in direction of bundle-sheath fibres, these walls are thicker than the region of littoral. The vascular bundles are continue (««open type»») of the sample of Tlemcen and discontinue («closed type») in that of the littoral region. The biometric study of fibres of rachides and leaflets of the chamaerops of Tlemcen shows that the average length of its fibres is 0. 46 mm for the young rachides and 0. 55 mm for the adult, those of the leaflets is 0. 63 mm for the young and 0. 66 mm for the adult leaflets. The comparative test shows that there is not significant difference within the species of Tlemcen. The values lengths obtained make it possible to classify this species among the plants with short fibres, this characteristic brings closer it with the plants with paper interest like the esparto. As for the species of the Oranian littoral, the lengths found for the young and adult rachides are 0. 77 m and 1. 28 mm, respectively the comparative test has shown that there is not significant difference for its fibres, on the other hand, there exist a difference for the leaflets of this region since T calculated is higher than T threshold. The average lengths of this species make it possible to bring it closer with the plants with average fibres. The comparative study was also carried out between the organs of the two regions, the results showed that there is a significant difference between the young rachides, adult rachides and adult leaflets of the two regions between then, these results make it possible to suggest that these species probably come from two differents populations and that can be one is more advanced than the other...|$|E
