5|$|The Ottoman Turkish Empire {{entered the}} First World War {{on the side}} of the Central Powers on 31 October 1914. The {{stalemate}} of trench warfare on the Western Front convinced the British Imperial War Cabinet that an attack on the Central Powers elsewhere, particularly Turkey, <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> way of winning the war. From February 1915 this took the form of naval operations aimed at forcing a passage through the Dardanelles, but after several setbacks it was decided that a land campaign was also necessary. To that end, the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force was formed under the command of General Ian Hamilton. Three amphibious landings were planned to secure the Gallipoli Peninsula, which would allow the navy to attack the Turkish capital Constantinople, in the hope that would convince the Turks to ask for an armistice.|$|E
25|$|Knowingly {{giving a}} person a placebo {{when there is}} an {{effective}} treatment available is a bioethically complex issue. While placebo-controlled trials might provide information about the effectiveness of a treatment, it denies some patients what <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> available (if unproven) treatment. Informed consent is usually required for a study to be considered ethical, including the disclosure that some test subjects will receive placebo treatments.|$|E
25|$|In the preseason, Oklahoma {{was picked}} by the Big 12 media to finish {{second in the}} conference. At the time, the {{starting}} quarterback had not been chosen. A little over {{a week before the}} first game, freshman quarterback Sam Bradford was announced as the starter. In his first game as a collegiate quarterback, Bradford threw for over 350yards in the first half, he tied Heisman Trophy winner Jason White's record of 18consecutive pass completions, and threw for fivetouchdowns. He came out of the game early in the 3rd quarter. Since then, Bradford led the nation in passing efficiency for most of the season. With the question at quarterback answered, some felt this team <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> in the nation, but with an unexpected loss at Colorado, the chances were slim. The Sooners continued to play strong following the loss and again rose in the polls as more teams above them also lost. Back in the #3 spot, the Sooners traveled to Lubbock, Texas to take on the Red Raiders to clinch the Big 12 South Division title. However, Bradford was injured on the opening play for the Sooners as they quickly fell behind. It was 27–10 at the halftime. Oklahoma mounted a comeback in the 4th quarter but it was not enough. The Sooners lost their second game and again were knocked out of the national title picture. In their next game against Oklahoma State, in what is referred to as Bedlam, the Sooners dominated winning 49–17 and locking up their spot in the Big 12 Championship Game. In the Big 12 Championship, Oklahoma faced Missouri, then the number one ranked team in the nation. The two faced each other in the regular season in Norman, Oklahoma with the Sooners winning 41–31. The Sooner defense dominated the game and the offense pulled away in the 2nd half. Oklahoma won 38–17 to claim their 5th Big 12 Conference Championship and 41st total conference championship.|$|E

The show was produced by Geffen and centered on Cher's songs, monologues, comedy performance, and her variation of clothing, which was the largest for a weekly TV show. Early critical reception was favorable; the Los Angeles Times exclaimed that [...] "Sonny without Cher was a disaster. Cher without Sonny, on the other hand, <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> thing that's happened to weekly television this season."

500|$|There {{are several}} {{documented}} cases of people surviving under highway overpasses, but scientists and meteorologists warn against using them for protection. From scientific lessons learned, meteorologists insist that overpasses are insufficient shelter from tornado winds and debris, {{and may be}} [...] to be during a violent tornado. The embankment under an overpass {{is higher than the}} surrounding terrain, and the wind speed increases with height. Additionally, the overpass design may create a [...] "wind-tunnel" [...] effect under the span, further increasing the wind speed. Many overpasses are completely exposed underneath and most lack hanging girders or a crawlspace-like area to provide sufficient protection from debris, which can travel at high speeds even in weak tornadoes. ( [...] a highway underpass is close at hand, and [...] it has such deep crawlspaces behind sheltering girders, and [...] no better shelter is available in the face of imminent danger from a tornado, then this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> and most survivable option. Otherwise, an underpass is no shelter at all.) People stopping underneath overpasses block the flow of traffic, putting others in danger.|$|E
500|$|The choreography {{was praised}} by media outlets; an editor from The Guardian wrote that Ziegler [...] "dances with such {{impressive}} flexibility".

[...] "Chandelier" [...] received nominations at the MTV Video Music Awards for Video of the Year and Best Choreography, and ultimately won the latter. It was also nominated for a 2015 Grammy Award for Best Music Video. The video went viral on YouTube and became the seventh most-watched video on the video-sharing website of 2014. As of October 2017, it has received over 1.7 billion views and was, at one point, the 13th most viewed YouTube video of all time. It has since moved down to 26th {{on the list of}} YouTube's Most Viewed Videos of All Time. As of January 2015, Billboard ranked the video at number 12 on the list of the 20 best of the 2010s (so far). Both Rolling Stone magazine and Spin magazine named it the Best Music Video of 2014. VH1 listed it first among the [...] "most groundbreaking" [...] videos of 2014.

500|$|Long an {{advocate}} for gender equality in climbing, Hill has argued {{that men and women}} can climb the same routes: [...] "I think they should have women compete on the same climbs as the men, and if the women can't do the climbs, then they shouldn't be competing". For example, she argued that both sexes compete on the same routes in World Cup competitions. However, Hill later revised her view, noting that while she could and did compete with men [...] "spectators want to see people get to the top. And since most women aren't climbing at the same level as the top men, it's necessary to design a route that's a little easier for women". In answer to a question about whether or not women [...] "will ever equal or surpass men in climbing", Hill gave a detailed response, focused on body composition, size, and psychology, explaining that climbing [...] "favors people with high strength-to-weight ratios", less body fat, and greater height, articulating that such characteristics often favor men but that women [...] "have the advantage of being relatively light, with the capacity for tremendous endurance". She explained that [...] "theoretically somebody as short as me <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> in the world because it doesn't depend so much on height now... And it's a psychological thing more than a physical thing." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Eagleton" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. James Poniewozik of Time magazine strongly praised Posey's performance, {{and said}} the garbage fight scene {{was one of the}} funniest of the season. He also complimented the show for giving Poehler's and Posey's characters a strong back story that helped further develop the history of Pawnee and the characters. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said [...] "Eagleton" [...] strongly developed Leslie, particularly in the way she ends the feud with Lindsay by building something new rather than resorting simply to revenge. He also praised Nick Offerman's comedic performance, {{and said the}} episode continues the strong development between Leslie and Ron's characters. Steve Kandell of New York magazine enjoyed the comedic chemistry between Poehler and Posey [...] and especially enjoyed the garbage fight scene [...] but said the sudden resolution to their feud felt forced. Kandell said Nick Offerman stole the episode, and that the final scene between Leslie and Ron about his birthday party <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> scene of the series. Damian Holbrook of TV Guide said Posey was perfectly cast in her guest role, and said of the episode: [...] "Sometimes TV gets it right, and last night, Parks and Recreation got it uber-right." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN found Posey's character [...] "somewhat one-note", but felt the episode was an improvement over the previous week's [...] "Jerry's Painting", and with great comedy coming from the portrayal of Eagleton and Ron's paranoia about his surprise birthday party.|$|E
