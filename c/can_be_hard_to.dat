5|$|As {{with the}} {{chemical}} antioxidants, cells are protected against oxidative stress by an interacting network of antioxidant enzymes. Here, the superoxide released by {{processes such as}} oxidative phosphorylation is first converted to hydrogen peroxide and then further reduced to give water. This detoxification pathway {{is the result of}} multiple enzymes, with superoxide dismutases catalysing the first step and then catalases and various peroxidases removing hydrogen peroxide. As with antioxidant metabolites, the contributions of these enzymes to antioxidant defenses <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> separate from one another, but the generation of transgenic mice lacking just one antioxidant enzyme can be informative.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} storm petrels {{are found}} in the northern hemisphere although some species around the equator dip into the south. They are strictly pelagic, coming to land only when breeding. In the case of most species, little is known of their behaviour and distribution at sea, where they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find and harder to identify. They are colonial nesters, displaying strong philopatry to their natal colonies and nesting sites. Most species nest in crevices or burrows and all but one species attend the breeding colonies nocturnally. Pairs form long-term monogamous bonds and share incubation and chick-feeding duties. Like many species of seabird, nesting is highly protracted with incubation taking up to 50 days and fledging another 70 days after that.|$|E

25|$|Identifying the {{characteristics}} of contemporary or postmodern art within Croatia <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> specify. Some common features are geometrizing and symbolic-metaphoric paintings, sculptures and installations. Some {{of the best known}} contemporary artists are painters Julije Knifer, Edo Murtić, Oton Gliha, and sculptor Ivan Kožarić.|$|E
25|$|His art <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> categorize, as he {{explored}} many different styles and techniques. Kraljević's graphic work displays strong tonal qualities {{and an excellent}} sense {{of light and dark}} relationships, perfectly suiting a sensitive temperament which could express extreme joy, but soon transform into deepest melancholy.|$|E
25|$|Elaborate haloes and {{especially}} aureoles also appear in Hindu sculpture, where {{they tend to}} develop into architectural frames in which the original idea <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> recognise. Theravada Buddhism and Jainism {{did not use the}} halo for many centuries, but later adopted it, though less thoroughly than other religious groups.|$|E
25|$|Messaging bugs <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> fix due to {{the longer}} trip {{they have to take}} versus the one off copy in a {{monolithic}} kernel.|$|R
5000|$|Injection, {{symptoms}} {{are similar to}} those of cutaneous anthrax, but injection anthrax can spread throughout the body faster and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> recognize and treat compared to cutaneous anthrax.|$|R
5000|$|The system <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> design, {{requiring}} both [...] "SPDT" [...] thermostats or relays and {{the ability}} of the system to withstand the fault condition whereby all zone valves are closed simultaneously.|$|R
25|$|Vertebral fractures, {{while having}} a smaller impact on mortality, {{can lead to}} a severe chronic pain of neurogenic origin, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> control, as well as deformity. Though rare, {{multiple}} vertebral fractures can lead to such severe hunch back (kyphosis), the resulting pressure on internal organs can impair one's ability to breathe.|$|E
25|$|Similarly with {{developmental}} dyslexia, {{there has been}} considerable interest in the idea that for some children reading problems are downstream consequences of difficulties in rapid auditory processing. Again, cause and effect <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> unravel. This {{is one reason why}} experts such as Moore have recommended using non-verbal auditory tests to diagnose APD.|$|E

5000|$|Changes <b>to</b> stored {{procedures}} <b>are</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> {{keep track}} of within a version control system than other code. Changes must be reproduced as scripts to be stored in the project history to be included, and differences in procedures <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> merge and track correctly.|$|R
50|$|This {{additional}} {{relationship can}} have severe consequences, since {{in some cases}} the performance standard can have major contribution to pressure exerted on individuals deciding whether to make the investment. With the slowing action actively undermining the performance standard, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> find the incentive to invest into additional resources.|$|R
25|$|Mercury {{thermometers}} {{and mercury}} light bulbs {{are not as}} common {{as they used to}} be, and the amount of mercury they contain is unlikely to be a health concern if handled carefully. However, broken items still require careful cleanup, as mercury <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> collect and it is easy to accidentally create a much larger exposure problem.|$|E
25|$|MIMO signal testing focuses {{first on}} the transmitter/receiver system. The random phases of the {{sub-carrier}} signals can produce instantaneous power levels that cause the amplifier to compress, momentarily causing distortion and ultimately symbol errors. Signals with a high PAR (peak-to-average ratio) can cause amplifiers to compress unpredictably during transmission. OFDM signals are very dynamic and compression problems <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> detect because of their noise-like nature.|$|E
25|$|Wave {{breaking}} intensity {{measures the}} force of the wave as it breaks, spills, or plunges (a plunging wave is termed by surfers as a “barrel wave”). Wave section length is the distance between two breaking crests in a wave set. Wave section length <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> measure because local winds, non-linear wave interactions, island sheltering, and swell interactions can cause multifarious wave configurations in the surf zone.|$|E
5000|$|Bulimia nervosa [...] "binge and purge", {{an eating}} {{disorder}} specified as reoccurring episodes of uncontrollable binge eating followed by a need to vomit, take laxatives, or exercise excessively. Usually begins occurring at adolescence but most individuals do not seek help until later in life when it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> change their eating habits.|$|R
50|$|Although more {{informative}} than box plots, {{a disadvantage}} of violin plots {{is that they}} are less popular. Because of their unpopularity, their meaning <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> grasp for many readers not familiar with the violin plot representation. In this case, a more accessible alternative <b>can</b> <b>be</b> plotting a series of stacked histograms or Kernel density distributions.|$|R

25|$|In Asia, the Asian tiger {{mosquito}} can {{be mistaken for}} {{other members of the}} subgenus Stegomyia, particularly the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti (the most prevalent species in the tropics and subtropics), because both species display a similar black and white pattern. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> distinguish Ae. albopictus from the closely related Aedes scutellaris (India, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines), Aedes pseudoalbopictus (India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam) and Aedes seatoi (Thailand).|$|E
25|$|Any {{stimulus}} {{that increases}} the likelihood of a behavior increasing is a reinforcer. An effective use of positive reinforcement would be frequent praise while an employee is learning a new task. An employee's behavior can also be shaped during the learning process if approximations of the ideal behavior are praised or rewarded. The frequency of reinforcement is an important consideration. While frequent praise during the learning process can be beneficial, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> sustain indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|Femoral hernias occur {{just below}} the {{inguinal}} ligament, when abdominal contents pass into the weak area at the posterior wall of the femoral canal. They <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> distinguish from the inguinal type (especially when ascending cephalad): however, they generally appear more rounded, and, in contrast to inguinal hernias, {{there is a strong}} female preponderance in femoral hernias. The incidence of strangulation in femoral hernias is high. Repair techniques are similar for femoral and inguinal hernia.|$|E
30|$|Evidence {{that people}} do {{something}} like what has been described is our ordinary experience that things <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> recognised from unfamiliar viewpoints than from familiar ones—the basis of some trick photos. That observation is confirmed in experimental studies showing that people are both slower at recognising things, and less accurate, when the viewpoint is unfamiliar (Bülthoff and Edelman 1992; Tarr 1995; Tarr and Pinker 1989).|$|R
50|$|Owners have {{reported}} that on the ground, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> clear snow and ice from wing surfaces with VGs than from a smooth wing, but VGs are not generally prone to inflight icing as they reside within the boundary layer of airflow. VGs may also have sharp edges which can tear the fabric of airframe covers and may thus require special covers to be made.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} HTML markup is to {{describe}} a document's structure, not its programmatic behavior. Combining the two can negatively impact a site's maintainability, like combining content and presentation. JavaScript behavior created and referenced in the HTML <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> use and maintain, for example when setting handlers for several events on a single element, when setting the same event handler on several elements, or when using event delegation.|$|R
25|$|Fuel can be {{different}} types of timber. Timber ranges from small logs two or three inches (76mm) across to larger logs that can burn for hours. It is typically difficult to gather without a hatchet or other cutting tool. In heavily used campsites, fuel wood <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find, so it may have to purchased at a nearby store or be brought from home. However, untreated wood should not be transported due to the probability that invasive species of bugs will be transported with it. Heat-treated wood such as kiln-dried lumber is safe to transport.|$|E
25|$|Protopolybia exigua is {{a species}} of vespid wasp found in South America and Southern Brazil. These neotropical wasps, of the tribe Epiponini, form large colonies with {{multiple}} queens per colony. P. exigua are small wasps that find nourishment from nectar and prey on arthropods. Their nests are disc-shaped and hang from the undersides of leaves and tree branches. This particular species of wasp <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> study because they frequently abandon their nests. P. exigua continuously seek refuge from phorid fly attacks and thus often flee infested nests to build new ones. The wasps’ most common predators are ants and the parasitoid phorid flies from the Phoridae family.|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{currency}} does, however, bear several anti-counterfeiting features. Two of {{the most}} critical anti-counterfeiting features of U.S. currency are the paper and the ink. The composition of the paper is 75 percent cotton and 25 percent linen. The ink and paper combine to create a distinct texture, particularly as the currency is circulated. The paper and the ink alone have no effect on {{the value of the dollar}} until post print. These characteristics <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> duplicate without the proper equipment and materials. Furthermore, recent redesigns of the $5, $10, $20, and $50 notes have added EURion constellation patterns which can be used by scanning software to recognize banknotes and refuse to scan them.|$|E
5000|$|Motorcycles with sidecars are {{not usually}} {{considered}} tricycles. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> categorize three-wheeled automobiles. While some early prototype automobiles were steam tricycles, three-wheeled cars such as the Morgan 3-Wheeler are often classified as cars rather than motorcycles. Generally the Motorcycle classification will require passengers to sit behind the driver, whereas in the car classification, at least one passenger is able to sit abreast to the driver ...|$|R
