50|$|Ancient bilge <b>force</b> <b>pumps</b> had {{a number}} of common uses. Depending on where the pump was located in the hull of the ship, it could be used to suck in sea water into a live fish tank to {{preserve}} fish until the ship was docked and the fish ready to be sold. Another use of the <b>force</b> <b>pump</b> was to combat fires. Water would again be sucked in through the bottom of the hull, and then pumped onto the blaze. Yet another suggested use for a <b>force</b> <b>pump</b> was to dispel water from a ship. The pump would be placed {{near the bottom of the}} hull so as to suck water out of the ship. <b>Force</b> <b>pumps</b> were used on land as well. They could be used to bring water up from a well or to fill high placed tanks so that water could be pressure pumped from these tanks. These tanks were for household use and/or small-scale irrigation. The <b>force</b> <b>pump</b> was portable and could therefore, as on ships, be used to fight fire.|$|R

5000|$|The most {{prevalent}} hydraulic pump used in maritime situations in ancient Rome was the bilge pump, which functioned to siphon collected {{water out of}} a ship’s hull (Oleson 1984). The bilge pump was an improvement on the first hydraulic pumps used in antiquity: <b>force</b> <b>pumps.</b> Invented around the early 3rd century BCE, the most primitive design of a <b>force</b> <b>pump</b> consisted of a piston pushing water out of a tube, constructed by soldering individual bronze elements (Stein 246).|$|R
50|$|Fluorinert {{is used in}} {{situations}} where air cannot carry away enough heat, or where airflow is so restricted {{that some sort of}} <b>forced</b> <b>pumping</b> is required.|$|R
50|$|The {{two main}} types of piston pump are the lift <b>pump</b> and the <b>force</b> <b>pump.</b> Both types may be {{operated}} either by hand or by an engine.|$|R

50|$|In 1689, Denis Papin {{suggested}} that the pressure and fresh air inside a diving bell could be maintained by a <b>force</b> <b>pump</b> or bellows. Engineer John Smeaton utilized this concept in 1789.|$|R
50|$|In a <b>force</b> <b>pump,</b> the {{upstroke}} of {{the piston}} draws water, through an inlet valve, into the cylinder. On the downstroke, {{the water is}} discharged, through an outlet valve, into the outlet pipe.|$|R
50|$|The phrase {{ram press}} (in lower case) {{commonly}} means the same thing; {{it is simply}} used for machines that press items by a mechanical ram, such as with a plunger, piston, <b>force</b> <b>pump,</b> or hydraulic ram.|$|R
50|$|This {{extremely}} simple pump {{was made}} of cast iron, and had no pistons, rods, cylinders, cranks, or flywheels. It operated by the direct action of steam on water. The mechanism consisted of two chambers. As the steam condensed in one chamber, it acted as a suction pump, while in the other chamber, steam was introduced under pressure and so it acted as a <b>force</b> <b>pump.</b> At {{the end of every}} stroke, a ball valve consisting of a small brass ball moved slightly, causing the two chambers to swap functions from suction-pump to force-pump and vice versa. The result was that the water was first suction <b>pumped</b> and then <b>force</b> <b>pumped.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The first Fresnel lens {{rotating}} system, {{the invention}} of Augustin-Jean Fresnel, was installed in Cordouan in 1823. Three concentric lamp wicks, supplied with rapeseed oil {{by means of a}} suction and <b>force</b> <b>pump,</b> were placed in the focal plane of the apparatus.|$|R
50|$|In the 4th century B.C., an Alexandrian Greek named Ctesibius made {{a double}} <b>force</b> <b>pump</b> called a siphona. As water {{rose in the}} chamber, it {{compressed}} the air inside, which forced the water to eject in a steady stream through a pipe and nozzle.|$|R
50|$|<b>Force</b> <b>pumps</b> {{could be}} made of either wood or bronze. Based on ancient texts, it seems that bronze was the {{preferred}} material since it lasted longer and was more easily transported. Wood was easier to build, put together, and repair but was not as durable as bronze. Because these were high-value objects, few are found in shipwrecks; they were often recovered after the ship sank. <b>Force</b> <b>pumps</b> were fairly simple in their construction consisting of a cylinder, a piston, and a few valves. Water would fill the cylinder after which the piston would descend into the cylinder, causing the water {{to move to a}} higher placed pipe. The valve would close, locking the water into the higher pipe, and then propelling it in a jet stream.|$|R
50|$|Ctesibius {{described}} one of {{the first}} <b>force</b> <b>pumps</b> for producing a jet of water, or for lifting water from wells, and examples have been found at various Roman sites, such as at Silchester in Britain. The principle of the siphon has also been attributed to him.|$|R
25|$|In 1689, Denis Papin had {{suggested}} that the pressure and fresh air inside a diving bell could be maintained by a <b>force</b> <b>pump</b> or bellows. His idea was implemented exactly 100 years later by the engineer John Smeaton who built the first workable diving air pump in 1789.|$|R

50|$|The {{station was}} {{equipped}} with two single-cylinder Crossley 'N'-type gas-fired engines and two Haywood Tyler triplex lift and <b>force</b> <b>pumps,</b> capable of pumping 9,600 gallons per hour. In the 1970s, a new station containing electric pumps capable of pumping 36,000 gallons per hour was built alongside the Edwardian building but the original engines and pumps have now been restored.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the first hydraulic automata by Ctesibius (flourished c. 270 BC) and Hero of Alexandria (c. 10 - 80 AD) is notable. Hero describes a number of working machines using hydraulic power, such as the <b>force</b> <b>pump,</b> which is known from many Roman sites as having been used for raising water and in fire engines.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} was {{powered by}} pressurised water stored in several hydraulic accumulators. Water, at a pressure of , was {{pumped into the}} accumulators by two [...] stationary steam engines, each driving a <b>force</b> <b>pump</b> from its piston tail rod. The accumulators each comprise a 20 in ram on which sits a very heavy weight to maintain the desired pressure.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, that's true enough. There's a big well {{a hundred}} feet deep in the stable-yard, and a <b>force</b> <b>pump,</b> which takes two men to work. It {{supplied}} the house {{as well as the}} stables. That's the only water there will be, and that won't be much good," [...] he added, as, on emerging from the wood, they suddenly caught sight of the house.|$|R
50|$|Water was {{conveyed}} {{from the}} well to the tower in a cast iron pipe thirteen inches in diameter when it was then forced into the tank by two <b>force</b> <b>pumps,</b> each of ten inches in diameter, worked by a duplicate, horizontal engine of twenty-five horse power. All the engines, pumps and pipes and {{the whole of the}} machinery were made by Mr Mitchell of the Perran Foundry, Cornwall.|$|R
50|$|Ancient agriculture, {{as in any}} period {{prior to}} the modern age the primary mode of {{production}} and subsistence, and its irrigation methods, were considerably advanced by the invention and widespread application {{of a number of}} previously unknown water-lifting devices, such as the vertical water-wheel, the compartmented wheel, the water turbine, Archimedes' screw, the bucket-chain and pot-garland, the <b>force</b> <b>pump,</b> the suction pump, the double-action piston pump and quite possibly the chain pump.|$|R

50|$|The engine had {{a single}} {{horizontal}} cylinder which, along with the boiler and firebox, was placed behind the rear axle. The motion of the piston was transmitted to a separate crankshaft via the forked piston rod. The crankshaft drove the axle of the driving wheel (which was fitted with a flywheel) via a spur gear. The steam cocks (used to blow out water condensate from the steam chest), the <b>force</b> <b>pump</b> and the firebox bellows were also driven by the crankshaft.|$|R
