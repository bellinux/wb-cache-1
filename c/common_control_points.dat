40|$|Quaternary records {{provide an}} {{opportunity}} to examine the nature of the vegetation and fire responses to rapid past climate changes comparable in velocity and magnitude to those expected in the 21 st century. The best documented examples of rapid climate change in the past are the warming events associated with the Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles during the last glacial period, which were sufficiently large to have had a potential feedback through changes in albedo and greenhouse gas emissions on climate. Previous reconstructions of vegetation and fire changes during the D-O cycles used independently constructed age models, making it difficult to compare the changes between different sites and regions. Here we present the ACER (Abrupt Climate Changes and Environmental Responses) global database which includes 93 pollen records from the last glacial period (73 – 15 [*]ka) with a temporal resolution better than 1, 000 years, 32 of which also provide charcoal records. A harmonized and consistent chronology based on radiometric dating (14 C, 234 U/ 230 Th, OSL, 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dated tephra layers) has been constructed for 86 of these records, although in some cases additional information was derived using <b>common</b> <b>control</b> <b>points</b> based on event stratigraphy. The ACER database compiles metadata including geospatial and dating information, pollen and charcoal counts and pollen percentages of the characteristic biomes, and is archived in Microsoft AccessTM at doi: 10. 1594 /PANGAEA. 870867...|$|E
40|$|Chick embryo hepatocytes were {{maintained}} in monolayer culture in a serum-free chemically defined medium for periods {{of up to}} 2 days. Over this time period, insulin provoked selective increases (up to 5 -fold) in factors relevant to the control of glycolysis: the activities of phosphofructokinase- 1 (PFK- 1), phosphofructokinase- 2 (PFK- 2) and hexokinase isoenzymes {{and the content of}} fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphate (F 26 BP). Half-maximal effects of insulin on pFK- 1 activity were in the physiological range (0. 1 nM). Changes in enzyme activities and F 26 BP content in response to insulin were correlated with stimulation of glycolytic flux as estimated by radioisotopic flux. These data are discussed in relation to known changes which occur in hepatic glycolytic activity and PFK- 1 activity in the intact chick around hatching. The effects of insulin on F 26 BP content, PFK- 1 activity and glycolytic flux were mimicked by epidermal growth factor (EGF). In contrast, phorbol esters produced minimal actions on any of the above parameters. Our data indicate that protein kinase C is not involved in the actions of insulin or EGF in control of F 26 BP content or PFK- 1 activity. This work indicates that the related tyrosyl kinase receptors of insulin and EGF may provoke identical responses within hepatocytes, but through the utilization of different transduction systems which merge to <b>common</b> <b>control</b> <b>points...</b>|$|E
40|$|Summary: To {{examine the}} planimetric {{accuracy}} of early nautical charts of Port Jackson (or Sydney Harbour), Australia’s most important port at that time, the shorelines in four charts are {{compared with the}} modern one. The charts examined are from 1791, 1822, 1859 and 1899. Two analysis methods were used. One with ArcGIS georeferenced each of the old charts to the modern shoreline and calculated root mean square differences between a set of <b>common</b> <b>control</b> <b>points.</b> The other used MapAnalyst to construct a distortion grid and displacement vectors {{for each of the}} old charts as they were compared with the modern shoreline. MapAnalyst was also used to calculate root mean square differences and mean position errors (MPEs). It was found that overall, as one would expect, the achieved accuracy improved with time. The earliest chart, that of 1791, had a mean position error (MPE) of 326 m. The survey for this chart was carried out within a few weeks of first European settlement and took only nine days. In the latest chart examined, that of 1899, the MPE had decreased to 38 m. One intriguing finding was that the overall accuracy of the 1859 chart was less than that of the 1822 chart, but in the main shipping areas, where accuracy was more important, the 1859 chart was better. It seems more care was taken where it mattered...|$|E

40|$|Detailed forest {{information}} is increasingly desired {{not only for}} forest management purposes but also for maintaining and enhancing sustainable forest ecosystems. Although precise measurements of forests can be gathered by field measurements, they are labor intensive and time consuming especially when obtaining enough measurements over large and heterogeneous forest areas. Therefore we need automated and accurate methods which can supplement field measurements. High spatial resolution remotely sensed data can be applied for this objective because developing technologies keep increasing spatial resolution and {{make it possible to}} handle large amounts of remotely sensed digital data by powerful computers at reasonable prices. Although high spatial resolution remotely sensed data holds {{the potential to be a}} valuable source of information for forest characteristics, a number of challenges still exist in extracting the desired information from this data. Therefore, it is critical to develop and improve automated methods to extract forest information. In this dissertation, I develop and improve the automated methods of extracting individual tree level forest biophysical parameters using high spatial resolution remotely sensed data. While there are many new remote sensing technologies, such as digital aerial photographs, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), radar, and multispectral (or hyperspectral) data, I mainly focus on small footprint LiDAR and aerial images (by digital frame camera) in this study, because these sensors can provide very high spatial resolution data, which are necessary to extract individual tree level biophysical characteristics. This study consists of three parts, which are basic procedures to exploit high spatial remotely sensed data to extract individual tree level forest biophysical parameters. All three studies are conducted in a mixed-conifer forest at Angelo Coast Range Reserve on the South Fork of the Eel River in Mendocino County, California, USA. First, I develop a robust method to reconstruct Digital Terrain Model (DTM) by classifying raw LiDAR points into ground and non-ground points with the Progressive Terrain Fragmentation (PTF) method. PTF applies iterative steps for searching terrain points by approximating terrain surfaces using the TIN (Triangulated Irregular Network) model constructed from the ground return points. Instead of using absolute slope or offset distance, the proposed method utilizes orthogonal distance to and relative angle between a triangular plane and a node. For that reason, PTF was able to classify raw LiDAR points into ground and non-ground points on a heterogeneous steep forested area with a small number of parameters. The results show the robust performance of the proposed method even under complex terrain conditions. Second, I develop an automated method to detect individual tree tops and delineate individual tree-crown boundaries using airborne LiDAR data. Because of heterogeneous site conditions, I divide the study site into two height classes (high and low trees). For high trees (>= 25 m), I detect tree tops by using a progressive window-size local maximum filter and I conduct an additional verification procedure to reduce false tree top detection by using the shape of canopy profiles between trees. Then, I delineate tree-crown boundaries by marker-controlled watershed segmentation. For low trees (< 25 m), I apply a fixed window-size local maximum filter (1 m radius) to detect tree tops, and I apply the skeleton by influence zones (SKIZ) segmentation to delineate crown boundaries. Compared to fixed window-size local maximum filtering method, our method performed better for detecting and delineating individual trees regardless of tree sizes. Third, I combine aerial images and LiDAR data by means of automated registration procedures using tree tops as corresponding control points. A morphological operation (extended-maxima transformation) is applied to detect tree tops (as <b>common</b> <b>control</b> <b>points)</b> from aerial images and LiDAR data. I conduct the preliminary matching by using the small region of the image center, which was near the principal point. Then, I iteratively expand the control points to the entire images by using the backward projection of the tree top points of the LiDAR data over the aerial images. I employ a local transformation method (piecewise linear transformation) by using detected control points. The adjacent geo-rectified images are mosaicked into one large image by using the seam lines, which are created from the <b>common</b> <b>control</b> <b>points</b> between images. The result shows that the proposed approach enables us to register aerial images with airborne LiDAR data by using individual trees as <b>common</b> <b>control</b> <b>points.</b> In this study, I develop and improve the automated approaches for extracting individual tree level forest information with high spatial resolution remotely sensed data. I expect the proposed approaches may contribute to cope with a number of challenges for forest information extraction from high spatial resolution remotely sensed data...|$|E
40|$|The {{deformation}} {{monitoring of}} subway tunnel is of extraordinary necessity. Therefore, {{a method for}} deformation monitoring based on terrestrial point clouds is proposed in this paper. First, the traditional adjacent stations registration is replaced by sectioncontrolled registration, so that the <b>common</b> <b>control</b> <b>points</b> {{can be used by}} each station and thus the error accumulation avoided within a section. Afterwards, the central axis of the subway tunnel is determined through RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithm and curve fitting. Although with very high resolution, laser points are still discrete and thus the vertical section is computed via the quadric fitting of the vicinity of interest, instead of the fitting of the whole model of a subway tunnel, which is determined by the intersection line rotated about the central axis of tunnel within a vertical plane. The extraction of the vertical section is then optimized using RANSAC for the purpose of filtering out noises. Based on the extracted vertical sections, the volume of tunnel deformation is estimated by the comparison between vertical sections extracted at the same position from different epochs of point clouds. Furthermore, the continuously extracted vertical sections are deployed to evaluate the convergent tendency of the tunnel. The proposed algorithms are verified using real datasets in terms of accuracy and computation efficiency. The experimental result of fitting accuracy analysis shows the maximum deviation between interpolated point and real point is 1. 5 mm, and the minimum one is 0. 1 mm; the convergent tendency of the tunnel was detected by the comparison of adjacent fitting radius. The maximum error is 6 mm, while the minimum one is 1 mm. The computation cost of vertical section abstraction is within 3 seconds/section, which proves high efficiency. ...|$|E

The time courses of water uptake, O 2 uptake, and ATP accumulation demonstrate that exogenous abscisic acid (ABA, 0. 1 millimoles per liter) specifically prevents the embryo {{from entering the}} growth phase. The inhibition of water uptake by ABA is a rapid (lag-phase about 1 hour) and fully reversible process {{which appears to be}} the cause rather than the result of changes of the energy metabolism. In untreated seeds, an osmotic pressure (polyethylene glycol 6000) of 11 bars is required for a simulation of the ABA effect on water uptake. However, in ABA-treated seeds an osmotic pressure of only 3 bars is sufficient to suppress water uptake. Thus, ABA lowers the ability of the embryo to absorb water under osmotic stress. In a two-factor analysis of the simultaneous action of ABA and osmoticum on germination, a complete synergistic interaction between these factors was found while ABA and cycloheximide exhibit independent (multiplicative) coaction. These results are interpreted in terms of a <b>common</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>point</b> of ABA and osmotic stress in the water relations of germinating seeds...|$|R

40|$|Digital audio {{networks}} allow multiple {{channels of}} audio to be streamed between devices. This {{eliminates the need}} for many different cables to route audio between devices. An added advantage of digital audio networks is the ability to configure and control the networked devices from a <b>common</b> <b>control</b> <b>point.</b> <b>Common</b> <b>control</b> of networked devices enables a sound engineer to establish and destroy audio stream connections between networked devices that are distances apart. On a digital audio network, an audio transport technology enables the exchange of data streams. Typically, an audio transport technology is capable of transporting both control messages and audio data streams. There exist a number of audio transport technologies. Some of these technologies implement data transport by exchanging OSI/ISO layer 2 data frames, while others transport data within OSI/ISO layer 3 packets. There are some approaches to achieving interoperability between devices that utilize different audio transport technologies. A digital audio device typically implements an audio control protocol, which enables it process configuration and control messages from a remote controller. An audio control protocol also defines the structure of the messages that are exchanged between compliant devices. There are currently a wide range of audio control protocols. Some audio control protocols utilize layer 3 audio transport technology, while others utilize layer 2 audio transport technology. An audio device can only communicate with other devices that implement the same control protocol, irrespective of a common transport technology that connects the devices. The existence of different audio control protocols among devices on a network results in a situation where the devices are unable to communicate with each other. Furthermore, a single control application is unable to establish or destroy audio stream connections between the networked devices, since they implement different control protocols. When an audio engineer is designing an audio network installation, this interoperability challenge restricts the choice of devices that can be included. Even when audio transport interoperability has been achieved, <b>common</b> <b>control</b> of the devices remains a challenge. This research investigates protocol command translation as a means to enable interoperability between networked audio devices that implement different audio control protocols. It proposes the use of a command translator that is capable of receiving messages conforming to one protocol from any of the networked devices, translating the received message to conform to a different control protocol, then transmitting the translated message to the intended target which understands the translated protocol message. In so doing, the command translator enables <b>common</b> <b>control</b> of the networked devices, since a control application is able to configure and control devices that conform to different protocols by utilizing the command translator to perform appropriate protocol translation...|$|R

An unstable area located in La Guardia (Jaen, Southern Spain), where an active mud flow has been identified, was surveyed between 2012 and 2014 by means of four UAV flights. These surveys were also compared with those data from a previous conventional aerial photogrammetric and LiDAR survey. The UAV was an octocopter equipped with GPS, inertial units and a mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera. The flight height was 90 m, which allowed covering an area of about 250 x 100 m with a ground pixel size of 2. 5 cm.

The model legume Medicago truncatula was used as a host for {{studying}} resistance and susceptibility to Verticillium albo-atrum. In addition to presenting well-established genetic resources, this wild plant species enables to investigate biodiversity of the response to the pathogen and putative crosstalk between disease and symbiosis. Symptom scoring after root inoculation and modelling of disease curves allowed assessing susceptibility levels in recombinant lines of three crosses between susceptible and resistant lines, in a core collection of 32 lines, and in mutants affected in symbiosis with rhizobia. A GFP-expressing V. albo-atrum strain was used to study colonization of susceptible plants. Symptoms and colonization pattern in infected M. truncatula plants were typical of Verticillium wilt. Three distinct major quantitative trait loci were identified using a multicross, multisite design, suggesting that simple genetic mechanisms appear to control Verticillium wilt resistance in M. truncatula lines A 17 and DZA 45. 5. The disease functional parameters varied largely in lines of the core collection. This biodiversity with regard to disease response encourages the development of association genetics and ecological approaches.

A questionnaire was distribution to hundred farm workers in Omdurman area to evaluate application and shortage in Hazard Analysis Critical <b>Control</b> <b>Point</b> (HACCP) prerequisites. The questionnaire targeted the milkers, milking hygiene and accumulation stage, utensils and farm hygiene and distribution methods of milk. The questionnaire and observations showed poor buildings construction, poor water supply, poor hygiene of farms as well as milkers and accumulation of dung and animalwaste that inducted insect spread. The questionnaire showed that 43 % of milkers were primary educated and 38 % illiterate. Knowledge about safety and hygiene while milking and milk distribution was limited, and training was lacking. To explore milk quality changes during distribution, milk samples were collected from different locations. Milk temperatures were in the range of 29 °C to 38 °C at distribution time intervals. pH was between 6. 48 and 6. 84 which favoured the growth of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria in milk. Viable count of bacteria, in most farms under study was high ranging between 1. 12 × 10 7 cfu/ml and 3. 44 × 10 10 cfu/ml.

5000|$|In NACMO (North American) style mounted orienteering and fox Oring {{only the}} general {{vicinity}} of the <b>control</b> <b>point</b> is marked on the map. In both sports the first objective is to navigate to the {{vicinity of the}} <b>control</b> <b>point.</b> Once there, the subsequent objectives are to find clues and take bearings, triangulate the location of the <b>control</b> <b>point,</b> then go directly to the <b>control</b> <b>point.</b> In mounted orienteering, once in the vicinity the competitor searches for clues (called landmarks) on a description sheet. The description sheet gives bearings from each clue to the <b>control</b> <b>point.</b> In fox Oring, once in the vicinity the competitor searches for a low power beacon at the <b>control</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R
50|$|To georeference an image, {{one first}} needs to {{establish}} <b>control</b> <b>points,</b> input the known geographic coordinates of these <b>control</b> <b>points,</b> choose the coordinate system and other projection parameters and then minimize residuals. Residuals are {{the difference between}} the actual coordinates of the <b>control</b> <b>points</b> and the coordinates predicted by the geographic model created using the <b>control</b> <b>points.</b> They provide a method of determining the level of accuracy of the georeferencing process.|$|R
