40|$|This paper {{examines}} the information-related {{problems associated with}} the analysis of fiscal policies, an issue recently analyzed in connection with monetary policies but largely ignored in the literature on <b>budgetary</b> <b>actions.</b> The results indicate that reliance on the information actually available to policy-makers in real-time is important for the assessment of past policies. We show that estimating fiscal policy rules based on ex post revised data tends to provide a misleading assessment of the sensitivity of discretionary policies to cyclical conditions. The results also suggest that part of the problems the Stability and Growth Pact encountered may have come from a misjudgment of cyclical conditions in some European countries in recent years. Real-time information, OECD countries, stabilization policies, fiscal policy rules...|$|R

A strategy for network design is presented that addresses the latter situation. It was developed in response to consensus in the state of Indiana that additional monitoring wells are needed to effectively characterize water availability in aquifer systems throughout the state. The strategic methodology has two primary objectives that guide decision making for new installations: (1) purposive sampling of a diversity of environmental variables having relevance to groundwater recharge, and (2) spatial optimization by means of maximizing geographic distances that separate monitoring wells. Design objectives are integrated in a discrete facility location model known as the p-median problem, and solved to optimality using a mathematical programming package...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis takes a detailed {{look at the}} activity of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in the area of Defense Procurement for the period, FY 1970 - 1973. By analyzing House Reports and records of hearings, the reasons for the Subcommittee <b>budgetary</b> <b>actions</b> are identified and cataloged so as to determine true Subcommittee initiative. For the period considered, three aspects of Subcommittee activity are identified which contribute to a greater insight into Congressional budgetary behavior. First, the authorization process is shown to have had an increasing impact on the Defense Procurement Appropriation; second, it is shown that less than 40 percent of all Subcommittee recommendations are the result of true committee initiative; and third, the Navy has been the Service most affected both in number of decisions and dollar amount of reduction. With regard to the fiscal versus programmatic controversy, it is suggested that Subcommittee behavior toward Defense Procurement has been more fiscal than programmatic. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a case study}} examining the demise {{of a high school}} Mandarin language program in a school district that appeared to offer an exceptionally friendly habitat for its survival. Though members of the school board majority who voted against funding the program offered rational explanations for their decision (e. g., insufficient fiscal and human resources), other case evidence revealed the influence of emerging political polarization. Using policy ecology theory and event ecology analytic lenses, evidence indi-cated the fundamental cause of program failure to be political climate change within the district ecosystem resulting from years of community conflict over a high school renovation proposal. The climate shift led to the election of a factionalized school board, whose first <b>budgetary</b> <b>action</b> was to can-cel funding for the Mandarin program, despite its popularity and established position within district strategic planning. We argue that much present and prior theory on organizational action lacks the dynamic perspective neces...|$|R
40|$|Fiscal policy {{triggers}} {{three distinct}} {{effects on the}} economy such as (1) interest rate effect (2) price effect and (3) exchange rate effect. A VAR system was developed to capture these effects in five South Asian countries. Empirical results suggest that <b>budgetary</b> <b>action</b> {{does not have any}} perceptible influence on the interest rate of the sampled countries. In terms of the price effect, fiscal action has opposite effects in Bangladesh and India. Fiscal action tends to increase aggregate price level in India but reduces the price level in Bangladesh, although the magnitude is very small. For Pakistan the price effect is positive but statistically insignificant while the price effect for Nepal and Sri Lanka is negative but statistically insignificant. Fiscal action is found to have no perceptible influence on the exchange rates of the sampled countries except Nepal where increased government expenditure tends to appreciate the Nepali currency. Overall, empirical findings suggest that expansionary fiscal action does not lead to crowding out behaviour in the sampled countries. Deficit financing, crowding-out, South Asia...|$|R
40|$|Yanich, DaniloScholars agree that, {{since the}} {{inception}} of the Department of Homeland Security, emergency management in the United States has been increasingly centralized. This study posits that centralization has been a longer term trend with negative effects on federal relationships. This dissertation examines the pay arrangements between the local and federal governments with respect to the Emergency Management Performance Grant and the Public Assistance Program. A nationwide study of county emergency managers investigated the attitudes towards these two programs and related <b>budgetary</b> <b>actions.</b> Respondents were asked to consider the extent of federal control over these financial assistance programs {{and the extent to which}} they were dependent upon them for program sustainment. Results of the study show that elements of federal control are more evident in the program that requires only a 25 % match by the local government. Further, emergency managers report that their organizations are dependent on federal aid and experience decreased autonomy as a result of the receipt of funds. Lastly, budgetary activities on the local level which would guard against this dependence and loss of autonomy are generally not undertaken.

5000|$|Any {{retained}} Referendum C revenue (revenue {{above the}} allowable TABOR limit but below the Referendum C cap) is statutorily {{required to be}} spent on health care, education, firefighter and police retirement plans and strategic transportation projects. Colorado Legislative Council Staff reported in 2009 that the state would have faced a significant budget shortfall had Referendum C not passed. Therefore, in many instances the Referendum C money that has been spent is not new money to programs, rather it maintained the programs and prevented them from undergoing cuts. It is money the programs may not have received without Referendum C, but it is not additional money when compared with prior years. However, the report also admits {{that it is impossible to}} enumerate this impact because it would require knowledge of what <b>budgetary</b> <b>actions</b> the state would have taken had Referendum C failed. Referendum C and other attempts to mitigate the effects of TABOR are referred to as [...] "de-Brucing" [...] after Douglas Bruce, the author of the amendment. In November 2005, Colorado residents voted to suspend for five years the state's self-imposed revenue caps as outlined in the state's Taxpayer Bill of Rights.The effects of TABOR on government spending and economic growth have been a popular discussion topic in recent years.

2500|$|In {{terms of}} the {{financial}} reform, since the recession, Hoover {{had been trying to}} repair the economy. He founded government agencies to encourage labor harmony and support local public works aid which promoted cooperation of government and business, stabilize prices, and strive to balance the budget. His work focused on indirect relief from individual countries and the private sector, which was reflected in the letter emphasizing [...] "more effective supporting for each national committee" [...] and volunteer service -" [...] appealing for funding" [...] from outside the government. The commitment to maintain the gold standard system prevented the Federal Reserve expanded its money supply operations in 1930 and 1931, and it promoted Hoover's destructive balancing <b>budgetary</b> <b>action</b> to avoid the gold standard system overwhelming the dollar. As the Great Depression became worse, the call raised for increasing in federal intervention and spending. But Hoover refused to allow the federal government to force fixed prices, control the value of the business or manipulate the currency, in contrast, he started to control the dollar price. For official dollar prices, he expanded the credit base through free market operations in federal reserve system to ensure the domestic value of the dollar. He also tended to provide indirect aid to banks or local public works projects, refused to use federal funds to give aid to citizens directly, which will reduce public morale. Instead, he focused on volunteering to raise money. Even though Hoover was a philanthropist before becoming president, his opponents regarded him as not responsible for the citizens. During the administration of Hoover, the US economic policies had moved to activism and interventionism. In his re-election campaign, Hoover tried to persuade the Americans to claim that the measures they requested seemed to be helpful in the short term, but it would be devastating in the long run. Eventually, he was defeated by Franklin Roosevelt in 1932.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} Austria's {{budget policy}} prior to accession to the European Union (EU) and <b>budgetary</b> <b>action</b> taken {{to support the}} opening up of the domestic economy and its integration into the EU. Moreover, it assesses the impact that joining the European monetary union has had on Austria's fiscal strategy. The analysis reveals several regime changes {{over the past few}} decades: While the fiscal policy goal of the 1960 s was, in essence, that of achieving a balanced budget, the government's commitment in the 1970 s to developing the welfare state and to pursuing a stabilizing role in addition to its allocation function fundamentally changed the fiscal framework. The rapid rise in the debt ratio that ensued {{in the second half of}} the 1970 s triggered a debate on the necessity of enforcing upper limits for budget deficits (as a percentage of GDP). This debate led to the proposition of the so-called Seidel formula, with which the federal government's budget deficit regained significance as a fiscal policy target. The government indeed responded to the rising interest payments on the spiraling debt with — heavily debated — consolidation measures. While EU accession as such in 1995 was not deemed to create substantial need for fiscal action, a general government deficit ratio in excess of 5 % of GDP called for significant consolidation measures in its own right in 1996 and 1997 in order to ensure that Austria would be among the founding members of the euro area. The new coalition government coming into office in 2000 staged a fiscal policy turnaround in so far as it propagated the goal of a balanced general government budget, which was indeed reached in 2001. Yet given the ongoing weakness of the economy, the goal of achieving strictly balanced budgets has since been redefined into balancing the general government budget over the business cycle. With its decision to design another tax reform, not fully financed right away, Austria recently changed its fiscal policy strategy yet again, incurring a “temporary deviation” from the medium-term target under the Stability and Growth PactEU, Accession, Austria, Budget Policy...|$|R
40|$|The Mid-Term Appraisal of the Tenth Plan {{notes that}} {{the reality is that}} women still remain largely {{untouched}} by Gender-just and Gender Sensitive Budgets as well as the Women’s Component Plan. Gender budgets are not separate budgets for men and women but are just a tool {{that can be used to}} ensure that the aggregate national or departmental budget is gender sensitive. The purpose of Gender Budgeting is to achieve gender-just allocations and outcomes in all sectors and Ministries. This requires identification of needs and priorities of women, especially those who are poor, examination of existing policies, programmes and schemes to determine whether or not they meet these priority needs; <b>corrective</b> reprioritization of <b>budgetary</b> allocations so that they are adequate for meeting those needs; and taking requisite follow-up actions to ensure that desired outcomes are attained. In other words, this tool can be used to address issues such as increased feminization of poverty, exploitation of women in low paid, arduous, insecure jobs; persistently high IMR, MMR, morbidity, anaemia and malnutrition due to lack of access to nutrition and quality healthcare.
