5|$|Another tradition, {{related by}} R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events {{which took place}} after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at this time, there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious {{to join in the}} festivities in the hall below, she left the infant alone in her room. When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies {{appeared}} and wrapped the infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder at the child and the garb wrapped around him. The room was filled with the fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across the <b>crowded</b> <b>room,</b> the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.|$|E

Before the election, he received a warm handshake from the PRC President Jiang Zemin who crossed a <b>crowded</b> <b>room</b> to single out Tung, which was seen as a sign of him being regarded as Beijing's choice for the Chief Executive. On 11 December 1996, he was elected by a 400-member Selection Committee, receiving 320 votes and beating former judge Yang Ti-liang and tycoon Peter Woo. He sworn in as the first Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the day of transfer of sovereignty on 1 July 1997.|$|E

The singer professes his love: [...] "I look around and everything I see is beautiful, because all I see is you." [...] According to The Huffington Posts Dean, Timberlake is in happier state of mind than on his 2002 song [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] or his 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around". However, his lyrics have an obsessive quality: [...] "A million people in a <b>crowded</b> <b>room,</b> but my camera lens is only set to zoom and it all becomes so clear." [...] Mellisa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly wrote that on [...] "Tunnel Vision", Timberlake is lyrically [...] "playing the rom-com director": [...] "Just like a movie shoot, I’m zoomin’ in on you as we ride off into the sun."

[...] "So Happy I Could Die" [...] was declared as the twenty-seventh best Lady Gaga song by Rolling Stone, who concluded: [...] "Gaga exults in the pleasures of club-hopping, drinking and bi-curiosity." [...] Under the Radar columnist Nick Hyman avouched that [...] "So Happy I Could Die" [...] was an uninspiring track, while Evan Sawdey of PopMatters felt that Gaga's vocals were the worst out of any of her songs. [...] "It's a bit of a disappointment, too, because for someone who is so painfully deliberate in crafting their unique visual image, it’s a let down to see that some of that quality control couldn’t be applied to the song selection that will ultimately define their legacy." ...|$|E

On July 4, 1828, the U.S. Marine Band performed the song at a ceremony for the formal opening of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which was attended by President John Quincy Adams. Andrew Jackson was the first living President to have the song used to honor his position in 1829, and it was played at Martin Van Buren's inauguration in 1837. Julia Tyler, second wife of John Tyler, requested its use to announce the arrival of the President. Her successor as First Lady, Sarah Childress Polk, encouraged its regular use in this manner after it was used at James Polk's inauguration; William Seale says, [...] "Polk was not an impressive figure, so some announcement was necessary to avoid the embarrassment of his entering a <b>crowded</b> <b>room</b> unnoticed. At large affairs the band...rolled the drums as they played the march...and a way was cleared for the President." [...] Under the term of Harry Truman the Department of Defense made it the official tribute to the President.|$|E

In the film she played a woman [...] "hardened by life's cruelties and a grief that will not fade." [...] It also co-starred a young Joanne Woodward {{in one of her}} early roles. In an article he wrote for Life magazine Williams discussed why he chose her for the part:"Anna and I had both cherished the dream that her appearance in the part I created for her in The Fugitive Kind would be her greatest triumph to date...

In the Palazzo Labia and Arkhangelskoye paintings (and the Paris and London modelli) there are steps in the foreground leading up to the dining table; although the Melbourne painting lacks these steps, the pattern of the marble floor gives a similar visual effect. [...] Only the two or three main figures are seated, but various attendants stand around them. [...] All the compositions show a clear debt to the grandly theatrical feast paintings of Paolo Veronese, nearly a century earlier, such as The Wedding at Cana (1563, Louvre) and The Feast in the House of Levi (1573, Accademia, Venice). [...] Venetian taste approved of such explicit reference to the city's artistic tradition. [...] In the Palazzo Labia the frescos were designed in conjunction with a scheme of trompe l'oeil architecture by Gerolamo Mengozzi Colonna embracing the whole space.
