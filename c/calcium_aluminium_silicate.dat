50|$|Partheite or parthéite is a <b>calcium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> and {{a member}} of the zeolite group of minerals, a group of silicates with large open {{channels}} throughout the crystal structure, which allow passage of liquids and gasses through the mineral. It was first discovered in 1979 in rodingitic dikes in an ophiolite zone of the Taurus Mountains in southwest Turkey. The second discovery occurred in gabbro-pegmatites in the Ural Mountains, Russia. Since its discovery and naming, the chemical formula for partheite has been revised from CaAl2Si2O8•2H2O to include not only water but hydroxyl groups as well. The framework of the mineral is interrupted due to these hydroxyl groups attaching themselves to aluminum centered oxygen tetrahedra. This type of interrupted framework is known in only one other zeolite, the mineral roggianite. As a silicate based mineral with the properties of a zeolite, partheite was first described as zeolite-like in 1984 and listed as a zeolite in 1985. Partheite and lawsonite are polymorphs. Associated minerals include prehnite, thomsonite, augite, chlorite and tremolite.|$|E

Isothermal calorimetry results showed an induction period spanning {{the first three days}} after mixing, followed by an acceleration-deceleration peak corresponding to the formation of bulk reaction products. Ettringite, a <b>calcium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> hydrate (C-A-S-H) phase, and a hydrotalcite-like Mg-Al layered double hydroxide have been identified as the main reaction products, independent of the Na 2 SO 4 dose. No changes in the phase assemblage were detected in the samples with curing from 1 month up to 18 months, indicating a stable binder structure. The most significant changes upon curing at advanced ages observed were growth of the AFt phase and an increase in silicate chain length in the C-A-S-H, resulting in higher strength...|$|E

3000|$|Open {{image in}} new window Montmorillonite {{is a very}} soft {{phyllosilicate}} mineral that typically forms in microscopic crystals, forming clay (Jaafar 2006). Montmorillonite, {{a member of the}} smectite family, has 2 : 1 expanding crystal lattice. The smectite group refers to a family of non-metallic clays primarily composed of hydrated sodium <b>calcium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate,</b> a group of monoclinic clay-like minerals with general formula (Ca, Na, H)(Al, Mg, Fe, Zn) 2 (Si, Al) 4 O 10 (OH) 2 ·nH 2 O (Grim 1962). Chemically, it is hydrated sodium calcium aluminium magnesium silicate hydroxide (Na,Ca) x (Al,Mg) 2 (Si 4 O 10)(OH) 2 ·nH 2 O. Potassium, iron and other cations are common substitutes and the exact ratio of cations varies with source (Jaafar 2006). The basic structural unit is a layer consisting of two inward-pointing tetrahedral sheets with a central alumina octahedral sheet. The layers are continuous in the length and width directions, but the bonds between these layers are weak and have excellent cleavage, allowing water and other molecules to enter between the layers causing expansion in the highness direction. Isomorphous substitution gives the various types of smectite and causes a net permanent charge balanced by cations in such a manner that water may move between the sheets of the crystal lattice, giving a reversible cation exchange and very plastic properties (Grim 1962).|$|E
40|$|Multi-technique {{characterisation}} {{of sodium}} carbonate-activated {{blast furnace slag}} binders was conducted {{in order to determine}} the influence of the carbonate groups on the structural and chemical evolution of these materials. At early age (< 4 days) there is a preferential reaction of Ca 2 + with the CO 3 2 − from the activator, forming calcium carbonates and gaylussite, while the aluminosilicate component of the slag reacts separately with the sodium from the activator to form zeolite NaA. These phases do not give the high degree of cohesion necessary for development of high early mechanical strength, and the reaction is relatively gradual due to the slow dissolution of the slag under the moderate pH conditions introduced by the Na 2 CO 3 as activator. Once the CO 3 2 − is exhausted, the activation reaction proceeds in similar way to an NaOH-activated slag binder, forming the typical binder phases <b>calcium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> hydrate and hydrotalcite, along with Ca-heulandite as a further (Ca,Al) -rich product. This is consistent with the significant gain in compressive strength and reduced porosity observed after 3 days of curing. The high mechanical strength and reduced permeability developed in these materials beyond 4 days of curing elucidate that Na 2 CO 3 -activated slag can develop desirable properties for use as a building material, although the slow early strength development is likely to be an issue in some applications. These results suggest that the inclusion of additions which could control the preferential consumption of Ca 2 + by the CO 3 2 − might accelerate the reaction kinetics of Na 2 CO 3 -activated slag at early times of curing, enhancing the use of these materials in engineering applications...|$|E
40|$|An {{enormous}} amount of dredged soils was generated from Malaysian rivers, lakes and seas. These dredged soils have poor geotechnical properties and are generally classified as "useless materials" [I]. However dredged soils can be recycled and reused as a potentially useful geo-material by solidification. This paper presents the study exploring the reuse potential of Malaysian dredged marine soils via the solidification technique, i. e. by using ordinary Portland cement and Class F fly ash. The dredged sample was essentially a high plasticity clay with a natural moisture content of approximately 166 %. As determined from standard compaction tests, the maximum dry density and the optimum moisture content were 1. 49 Mg/m 3 (equivalent to 14. 62 kN/m" and 24 % respectively. XRF (X-ray fluorescence) analysis showed that the material contained high concentrations of SiO, and A 1203 This {{was supported by the}} XRD (X-ray diffractometry) results, showing presence of quartz, halite, calcite and kaolinite as the primary compounds in the sample. The dredged soil was solidified with 10 % of additives by dry mass of soil with various ratios of cement: fly ash, i. e. 10 : 0, 7 : 3, 55, 3. 7 and 0 :lO. The specimens were then subjected to curing times of 3, 7 and 28 days. pH of the solidified specimens showed an increment with increased cement content as well as curing time. Observations with FESEM (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy) revealed effective sealing of voids within the original soil mass through the solidification process, evidence of the formation of cementitious products. These cementitious gels, such as calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) and <b>calcium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> hydrate (CASH), would {{play a crucial role in}} strength development of the treated dredged soil. As a general conclusion, solidification using cement-fly ash could revive the otherwise discarded dredged marine soils for reuse as a sound geo-material in various civil engineering applications, especially as a backfill material...|$|E

40|$|Data {{concerning}} potential solid {{products of}} the interaction of cement pore fluids with bentonite have been reviewed with respect to accurate prediction of bentonite alteration in the long-term. <b>Calcium</b> (<b>aluminium)</b> <b>silicate</b> hydrates (C(A) SH), zeolites, feldspars, hydroxides, carbonates, polymorphs of silica, and some sheet silicates (all of varying degrees of crystallinity) are potential products of cement–bentonite interaction. Evidence from natural systems and laboratory studies suggests that most, {{or all of these}} phases, may precipitate on timescales of interest to safety assessment of the geological disposal of radioactive wastes. These data indicate that growth kinetics of secondary minerals is equally as important as thermodynamic stability in controlling occurrence. C(A) SH show variable Ca/Si ratio and Al contents. At high pH (> 11), the growth of C(A) SH minerals provides a means by which OH− ions from cement pore fluids may be titrated. Although thermodynamic data exist for a number of naturally-occurring crystalline C(A) SH minerals, they are of doubtful quality and should be applied with caution in predictive modelling. Zeolites are likely to form at lower pH than for C(A) SH, with the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite decreasing with increasing pH of the fluid. Zeolite stability is also strongly dependent upon silica activity in the fluid phase. Although silica activity in bentonite pore fluids will be spatially (and temporally) variable as hyperalkaline alteration proceeds, it is likely that minerals which could form would be those stable in quartz-saturated or supersaturated fluids. Currently available thermodynamic data for zeolites tend to overestimate their stability, leading to inaccurate predictions of their occurrence. Notwithstanding this uncertainty, it is considered that the following secondary minerals are the most likely to form in low temperature cement–bentonite systems: calcite, dolomite, chalcedony, C(A) SH of variable Ca/Si ratio, K-feldspar, illite, phillipsite, analcime, clinoptilolite, and heulandite. The relatively more siliceous zeolites (clinoptilolite, phillipsite) are likely to form at lower pH (distal regions of migrating cement pore fluids), whereas C(A) SH, illite, feldspars, and the more aluminous zeolites (analcime, heulandite) are more likely to form at higher pH and hence, the more proximal regions of migrating cement pore fluids. Predominantly Na-, K-bearing solids will be transformed to those dominated by Ca as the composition of cement pore fluids evolves with time...|$|E
50|$|Phillipsite is {{a mineral}} {{series of the}} zeolite group; a {{hydrated}} potassium, <b>calcium</b> and <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate,</b> approximating to (Ca,Na2,K2)3Al6Si10O32·12H2O. The members of the series are phillipsite-K, phillipsite-Na and phillipsite-Ca. The crystals are monoclinic, but only complex cruciform twins are known, these being exactly like twins of harmotome which also forms a series with phillipsite-Ca. Crystals of phillipsite are, however, usually smaller and more transparent and glassy than those of harmotome. Spherical groups with a radially fibrous structure and bristled with crystals on the surface are not uncommon. The Mohs hardness is 4.5, and the specific gravity is 2.2. The species was established by Armand Lévy in 1825 and named after William Phillips. French authors use the name Christianite (after Christian VIII of Denmark), given by A. Des Cloizeaux in 1847.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the use of propranolol-magnesium <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> intercalated complexes as drug reservoirs in hydroxypropylmethylcellulose tablets. The matrix tablets containing the complexes were prepared and characterised with respect to propranolol release and were subsequently compared with those loading propranolol or a propranolol-magnesium <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> physical mixture. Additionally, the effects of varying viscosity grades of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, compression pressures and calcium acetate incorporation on the drug release characteristics of the complex-loaded tablets were also examined. The results showed that the complex-loaded tablets have higher tablet hardness than those containing propranolol or a physical mixture. The drug release from the complex-loaded tablets followed a zero-order release kinetic, whereas an anomalous transport was found in the propranolol or physical mixture tablets. The drug release rate of the complex tablet significantly decreased with increasing hydroxypropylmethylcellulose viscosity grade. Increase in the compression pressure caused a decrease in the drug release rate of the tablets. Furthermore, the incorporation of calcium ions could accelerate propranolol release, particularly in acidic medium, because calcium ions could be exchanged with propranolol molecules intercalated in the silicate layers of magnesium <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate.</b> These findings suggest that propranolol-magnesium <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> intercalated complexes show strong potential for use as drug reservoirs in matrix tablets intended for modifying drug release...|$|R
