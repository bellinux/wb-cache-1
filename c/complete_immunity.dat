5|$|Ubico {{had made}} {{statements}} supporting {{the labor movement}} when campaigning for the presidency, but after his election his policy quickly became authoritarian. He abolished the system of debt peonage, {{and replaced it with}} a vagrancy law, which required all men of working age who did not own land to perform a minimum of 100 days of hard labor. In addition, the state made use of unpaid Indian labor to work on public infrastructure like roads and railroads. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners <b>complete</b> <b>immunity</b> from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property, an action described by historians as legalizing murder. He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it {{into one of the most}} efficient and ruthless in Latin America. The police were given greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the labor laws. The result of these laws was to create tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers. Ubico was highly contemptuous of the country's indigenous people, once stating that they resembled donkeys.|$|E

25|$|A better {{solution}} came {{along in the}} form of the US's AGM-48 Skybolt missile. The US bomber force was facing the same sorts of problems as the British V bombers, and were attempting to solve it in a similar fashion, with a long-range standoff missile. In this case, however, the missile in question had a truly long range of just under 2,000km. Considering the distance from London to Moscow is about 2,500km, Skybolt would allow the V-bomber force to attack Russia from sites not far off the British coast, with <b>complete</b> <b>immunity.</b> Skybolt seemed like such a good solution that work on both Blue Steel II and Blue Streak were cancelled.|$|E

They lived in fine houses and soon a romantic aura surrounded the Purples that distinguished them from the other gangs in Detroit.

25|$|A {{total of}} 463 {{aircraft}} were produced. A single prototype of a turbocharged development mounting a 4-blade propeller was built; this {{was called the}} C6N2 Saiun-kai. A night-fighter version C6N1-S with oblique-firing (Schräge Musik configuration) single 30mm (or dual 20mm) cannon and a torpedo carrying C6N1-B were also developed. The C6N1-B developed by Nakajima was not needed after Japan's aircraft carriers were destroyed. As Allied bombers came within reach of the Japanese home islands, there became {{a need for a}} first class night fighter. This led Nakajima to develop the C6N1-S by removing the observer and replacing him with two 20mm cannons. The C6N1-S's effectiveness was hampered by the lack of air-to-air radar, although it was fast enough to enjoy almost <b>complete</b> <b>immunity</b> from interception by Allied fighters.|$|E

The conclusion is that both the disturbance propagation network and on-chip transistor circuit {{should be considered in}} the immunity simulation. 1...|$|R
500|$|In 1871 the {{government}} of Justo Rufino Barrios passed laws confiscating the lands of the native Mayan people and compelling them to work in coffee plantations for minimal compensation. Several United States-based companies, including the United Fruit Company, received this public land, and were exempted from paying taxes. In 1929 the Great Depression led {{to the collapse of}} the economy and a rise in unemployment, leading to unrest among workers and laborers. Fearing the possibility of a revolution, the landed elite lent their support to Jorge Ubico, who won the election that followed in 1931, an election in which he was the only candidate. With the support of the United States, Ubico soon became one of Latin America's most brutal dictators. Ubico abolished the system of debt peonage introduced by Barrios and replaced it with a vagrancy law, which required all men of working age who did not own land to perform a minimum of 100 days of hard labor. In addition, the state made use of unpaid Indian labor to work on public infrastructure such as roads and railroads.

40|$|AbstractSimian virus 40 (SV 40) {{contains}} an essential protein, large tumor antigen (Tag), which assists in viral replication and causes cell transformation and immortalization. Our laboratory has examined plasmid DNA, expressing SV 40 Tag under two different promoters, {{for use in}} potential cancer vaccination strategies. One plasmid, pSV 3 -neo, failed to induce SV 40 Tag antibody, produced a weak cell-mediated response, and only partial protection in murine experimental tumor challenge systems. The second plasmid, pCMV-Tag, induced antibodies to SV 40 Tag, produced a robust cell-mediated response, and invoked <b>complete</b> tumor <b>immunity</b> in vivo. The induction of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses following plasmid DNA immunization and tumor cell challenge reflected a type 1 cytokine secretion profile. Our hypothesis for this differential immune response is that pCMV-Tag exhibits {{a higher level of}} transgene expression due to a more efficient promoter. We determined that pCMV-Tag levels of SV 40 Tag mRNA and protein expression were higher when compared to pSV 3 -neo. A threshold amount of SV 40 Tag may be required to stimulate antibody production and provide <b>complete</b> systemic tumor <b>immunity...</b>|$|R

Thus, counties, which are considered to be arms of the state, still carry the state's traditional <b>complete</b> <b>immunity</b> from tort lawsuits. Cities and towns are not considered arms of the state, and are only held to be immune from such lawsuits if the city or town was exercising a public or [...] "governmental" [...] function. Such functions have been held to include police and firefighting activities, and education.

WN-VAX was then examined for immunogenicity in mice previously immunized with Japanese encephalitis vaccine (JE-VAX). Immunization with WN-VAX induced WN virus-neutralizing antibody in all mice previously immunized with JE-VAX but in only half of the control mice at 10  weeks. These results indicate that WN-VAX induced <b>complete</b> protective <b>immunity</b> against lethal WN infection and that the WN-VAX-induced antibody response is facilitated in JE-VAX-immunized mice.

60|$|It is {{a general}} belief that men of {{different}} stocks differ as much physiologically as they do morphologically; {{but it is very}} hard to prove, in any particular case, how much of a supposed national characteristic is due to inherent physiological peculiarities, and how much to the influence of circumstances. There is much evidence to show, however, that some stocks enjoy a partial or <b>complete</b> <b>immunity</b> from diseases which destroy, or decimate, others. Thus there seems good ground for the belief that Negroes are remarkably exempt from yellow fever; and that, among Europeans, the melanochrous people are less obnoxious to its ravages than the xanthochrous. But many writers, not content with physiological differences of this kind, undertake to prove the existence of others of far greater moment; and, indeed, to show that certain stocks of mankind exhibit, more or less distinctly, the physiological characters of true species. Unions between these stocks, and still more between the half-breeds arising from their mixture, are affirmed to be either infertile, or less fertile than those which take place between males and females of either stock under the same circumstances. Some go so far as to assert that no mixed breeds of mankind can maintain themselves without the assistance of one or other of the parent stocks, and that, consequently, they must inevitably be obliterated in the long run.|$|E

The aims of this study were to characterize virulence towards Rps 2 among different P. sojae strains, track the inheritance of this trait, and attempt to identify an Avr 2 gene. Fifteen P. sojae strains were tested for virulence towards Rps 2 and crosses were performed between selected virulent and avirulent strains to follow the inheritance of virulence. Although parental strains were consistent in their virulence phenotype, many progeny were unstable. Of two candidate genes for Avr 2 tested, neither showed co-segregation with the Rps 2 -virulence trait. Overall, results indicate that virulence towards Rps 2 is inherited in a non-Mendelian fashion; the factors responsible could include epistasis, gene conversion, or other epigenetic phenomena...|$|R
