50|$|Some {{prerequisites}} {{are needed}} for control scheme to be reliable by pure feed-forward without feedback: the external <b>command</b> or <b>controlling</b> <b>signal</b> must be available, {{and the effect of}} the output of the system on the load should be known (that usually means that the load must be predictably unchanging with time). Sometimes pure feed-forward control without feedback is called 'ballistic', because once a <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> has been sent, it cannot be further adjusted; any corrective adjustment must be by way of a new <b>control</b> <b>signal.</b> In contrast 'cruise control' adjusts the output in response to the load that it encounters, by a feedback mechanism.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} the {{implementation}} of such a strategy could be: Ballistic missile submarines are ordered to surface at periodic intervals to receive communications indicating that no change {{has occurred in the}} defense condition.

All available means of verification and all due caution would naturally be applied. This approach is obviously exceptionally dangerous for a variety of reasons. The strategy's true value is in deterrence against attack on <b>command,</b> <b>control,</b> communications, and computer (see C4I) networks by any potential adversary.|$|R

40|$|Introduction A {{computerized}} real-time {{system is}} required to complete its work on a timely basis. Typical applications are digital <b>control,</b> <b>command</b> and <b>control,</b> <b>signal</b> processing and communication systems. The aim of real-time scheduling is to build-up a sequence of jobs that meets hard timing constraints at run-time. In opposition with the classical scheduling literature, real-time scheduling is not necessarily on-line scheduling. The main characteristic of real-time systems is the behavioral predictability. Timing constraints will be met whatever happens in the system. Real-time operating systems define recurring tasks. Real-time tasks are often periodically released. Basically, a periodic task gets its input data from sensors and <b>command</b> the <b>controlled</b> process by sending data to actuators. Every execution of a task is called a job.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a direct fault {{tolerant}} control (DFTC) technique, where by "direct" we mean that no explicit fault identification is used. The technique will be presented for the attitude controller (autopilot) for a reusable launch vehicle (RLV), although in principle it {{can be applied to}} many other applications. Any partial or complete failure of control actuators and effectors will be inferred from saturation of one or more <b>commanded</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> generated by the controller. The saturation causes a reduction in the effective gain, or bandwidth of the feedback loop, which can be modeled as an increase in singular perturbation in the loop. In order to maintain stability, the bandwidth of the nominal (reduced-order) system will be reduced proportionally according to the singular perturbation theory. The presented DFTC technique automatically handles momentary saturations and integrator windup caused by excessive disturbances, guidance command or dispersions under normal vehicle conditions. For multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) systems with redundant control effectors, such as the RLV attitude control system, an algorithm is presented for determining the direction of bandwidth cutback using the method of minimum-time optimal control with constrained control {{in order to maintain the}} best performance that is possible with the reduced control authority. Other bandwidth cutback logic, such as one that preserves the commanded direction of the bandwidth or favors a preferred direction when the commanded direction cannot be achieved, is also discussed. In this extended abstract, a simplistic example is proved to demonstrate the idea. In the final paper, test results on the high fidelity 6 -DOF X- 33 model with severe dispersions will be presented...|$|R
50|$|Naval historians {{covering}} this period {{disagree on the}} value of the secondary battery. Arguing for, it provided protection against surface torpedo craft without needing a flotilla of supporting craft that smoked up the range and burdened the admiral with additional <b>command,</b> <b>control</b> and <b>signalling.</b> Arguing against, it consumed considerable displacement (2000 tons or more), were holes in the side close to the waterline that increased the risk of capsizing, and could not be heavily armoured yet were connected to magazines that threatened the destruction of the ship. There were also considerable difficulties in bringing secondary weapons into action with the main guns; they too smoked up the range, splashed and obscured their target, and might required maneuvers to open secondary arcs that put the main guns at a disadvantage. Battle experience showed that capital ships were almost always accompanied by their flotillas, secondary batteries were ineffective against capital ships, but that German battleship secondary batteries were very effective in the Jutland night action against British destroyers.|$|R

30|$|Among the authorsâ who use {{classification}} techniques, Strayer et al. have developed detection approaches by examining flow {{characteristics such as}} bandwidth, packet timing, and burst duration. In this study, the authors first eliminate traffic that {{is unlikely to be}} a part of a botnet, classify the remaining traffic into a group that is likely to be part of a botnet by using J 48 decision trees, naÃ¯ve Bayes, and Bayesian classifier. Finally, the likely traffic is correlated to find common communications patterns that would suggest the activity of a botnet [18, 20]. Fairly recently, a decision tree classifier has been used by Zhao et al. [19] to detect botnets by investigating 12 flow based features. Their proposed method can detect botnets during the C&C and attack phases based on the observation of flow based features for specific time intervals. It does not require significant malicious activity to occur before detection as it can recognize <b>command</b> and <b>control</b> <b>signals.</b> Simultaneously, it does not require the knowledge about group behavior of several bots before it can be confident about making a decision.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focus on}} the unique human ability {{to pick up and}} {{manipulate}} small objects using the precision grip, i. e., the fine grip between the index finger and the thumb. This ability is formed by the interplay between the complex biomechanical machinery of the hand and the neural networks within the central nervous system. To gain further knowledge about how humans control the precision grip, both the biomechanical system and the neural control system has to be examined. For the control system, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging on human subjects to mapout the cortical network involved in different aspects of the precision grip. When subjects applied a small grip force in comparison to a larger gripforce, activity in secondary sensorimotor related areas in the frontal and parietal lobes increased. Our result suggests that these areas {{play an important role in}} the control of fine precision grip forces in the range typically used in manipulation of small objects. We also observed increased activity in a small area of the right intraparietal cortex when the subjects coordinated the grip and the load forces in an attempt to lift a fixated object. This is the first evidence for involvement of the posterior parietal cortex in the sensorimotor control of coordinated grip and lift forces in manipulation. We applied a system identification approach to model the biomechanical system. A new technique was presented, common subsystem identification, with which the common mathematical factors in two models, identified using data from functionally different experiments, was estimated. It is concluded that these factors represent the common subsystem, here the grip force generator, involved in the experiments. The characteristics of the identified model were in agreement with experimental data on human neuromuscular grip force dynamics. The model was then extended to include wrist movement, and the consequent lift force from the frictional interaction with an object. Predictions of the motor <b>commands</b> (<b>control</b> <b>signals)</b> could then be formed by feeding human data through the inverted model. Hence, the motor commands used in response to an unexpectedly low friction at the grip surface, could be estimated. In agreement with recordings from neurons in the primary motor cortex of the monkey, a sharp burst in the estimated motor command for the gripforce efficiently arrested any slip. The results further indicate a state dependent control system that uses a small set of efficient corrective commands. The predicted motor commands was also compared with those theoretically optimized, with respect to minimum variance in fingertip forces. This was based on the suggestion that signal-dependent noise in the motor <b>command</b> influences movement <b>control</b> (Harris and Wolpert, 1998). We show, for the first time, that minimization of the gripforce variance, due to signal-dependent noise, indeed explains the characteristic motor commands and force profiles of a voluntary precision grip, as well as the m...|$|R

30|$|Broadcast is an {{essential}} feature in any sensor network for critical operations such as network query, software updates, time synchronisation, and network management. Given its importance, there is growing interest in addressing broadcast security [1]. Much of the research literature has focused on authenticity of the broadcast source and data; we refer the reader to a recent article [2] that summarises the challenges of broadcast authentication in resource constrained wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we consider secrecy (also refered to as confidentiality or privacy) of the broadcast data. Several critical applications warrant secrecy, such as <b>command</b> and <b>control</b> <b>signaling</b> in the battlefield. The application that motivates this paper is a project undertaken by our organisation, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), to build a Water Resources Observation Network (WRON) [3] to assist in managing and controlling the national water resources of Australia. CSIRO has developed sensor nodes called Flecks [4] which are candidates for deployment at sites such as farms, rivers, lakes, dams, and catchment areas. Secrecy of various broadcast data and control messages is important in such a scenario: for example, the sensory parameters (such as sampling periods and thresholds) that would {{from time to time}} be updated using broadcast mechanisms need to be kept secret, and software upgrades need to be kept confidential to prevent exploitation of code weaknesses. This paper develops mechanisms that operate within the resource constraints of sensor nodes to ensure secrecy of such broadcast data, while also guaranteeing authenticity, integrity, and freshness of the broadcast messages.|$|R
40|$|Background: Putting {{represents}} {{one of the most important}} components of golf. However, associated with it is the âyips,â which is involuntary motions of the body of a presumed psychological and physiological nature that adversely affect performance. Many golfers are afflicted with the yips, especially those with long-term experience in golf. In the current study, selected body movements and physiological functions, as well as perceived stress level, were monitored under conditions that modulated the golferâs stress level. Methods: Five young-adult, visually-normal students who were experienced golfers participated in the investigation. Putting was assessed for 6 -foot and 3 -foot putts, with a reward/penalty system that favored the former but not the latter, to create a sensation of âstressâ as would be found in a real golf tournament. Eye, head, and putter movements were assessed objectively, as well as heart and breathing rates. In addition, a 5 -point subjective rating scale was used to quantify the perceived level of stress during the test conditions. Results: Heart rate significantly increased for the stressed 3 -foot versus the unstressed 6 -foot putts, while breathing rate remained unchanged. Also, eye movement variation increased in three of the five subjects under the more stressful putting condition. Conclusions: The results suggest that the increased stress level imposed by the different putting conditions was reflected in changes in both physiological and psychological states. It is hypothesized that the yips is produced by the corruption of the central <b>command</b> motor <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> by the avoidance reflex associated with the shorter putts under pressure conditions...|$|R
