30|$|In our case, a <b>capnometer</b> {{was useful}} for {{differentiating}} between bronchospasm and laryngospasm. Although a definitive diagnosis of laryngospasm {{is made by}} examination of the vocal cords with a bronchial fiberscope [20], there was insufficient time to perform bronchial fiberscopy {{in order to prevent}} progression to NPPE. No waveform appears in <b>capnometer</b> readings of laryngospasm, which causes complete occlusion of the upper respiratory tract; however, they reveal waveform patterns of occlusive respiratory disorders and provide EtCO 2 values in most cases of bronchospasm. In our case, laryngospasm was diagnosed because EtCO 2 waveforms were absent on the <b>capnometer</b> readings, and continuous positive airway pressure with 100 % oxygen was applied through a facemask, resulting in relief of symptoms.|$|E
30|$|The {{widespread}} {{availability and}} relatively low cost of <b>capnometers,</b> and software to analyze VCO 2 from CO 2 concentrations and expiratory volume, may make VCO 2 -based calorimetry {{a simple and}} accurate method for determination of EE in critically ill patients, whenever needed. Production of the most extensively used IC system (Deltatrac Metabolic Monitor) has been discontinued, and newer available IC systems give conflicting EE estimates [37]. Thus, {{in the absence of}} other devices validated for use in the ICU, use of CO 2 -based calorimetry can represent a useful alternative for the determination of EE.|$|R
30|$|Another {{important}} point to consider, although sometimes neglected, is the 14 % higher viscosity of helium compared with nitrogen. In cases of pure laminar flow, such a property directly increases the resistances, {{as shown by}} the Poiseuille's law: R = (8.l. η)/Π.r 4 (where R is the resistance, l is the length of the pipe, η is the viscosity, and r its radius). This could potentially increase part of the respiratory resistances, because of a larger cross-sectional area flow is mainly laminar in the distal airways, even in obstructive diseases. Moreover, this might have additional clinical implications both for research purpose as well as for care and monitoring, because flow and volume are sometimes measured by methods that need a correcting factor for viscosity (i.e., via pneumotachograph). More generally, useful publications are available that describe the consequences of the use of helium both for mechanical ventilators and for monitoring devices, such as <b>capnometers</b> [2, 3].|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} {{correlation}} and concordance between end-tidal {{carbon dioxide and}} arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure, and confirm {{the experience of the}} general consensus among service environments. DESIGN: A prospective cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: Two respiratory service units in Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred respiratory patients were recruited, in whom 219 sets of observations were recorded. Patients deemed to require arterial blood gas determination also had their end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure measured at that time, using two LifeSense LS 1 - 9 R <b>Capnometers.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The agreement of end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure and arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure was studied by correlation coefficients, mean and standard deviation of their difference, and the Bland-Altman plot. RESULTS: Overall, the correlation was low and insignificant (r= 0. 1185, P= 0. 0801). The mean of the difference was 7. 2 torr (95 % confidence interval, 5. 5 - 8. 9) and significant (P< 0. 001). The limits of agreement by Bland-Altman analysis were - 18. 1 to 32. 5 torr, which were too large to be acceptable. In the sub-group on room air, the mean difference was reduced to 2. 26 torr, the correlation between end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure and arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure was 0. 2194 (P= 0. 0068), though statistically significant, the extent of correlation was still low. CONCLUSION: End-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure did not show significant correlation or concordance with arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure, especially when supplemental oxygen was used. End-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure currently cannot replace arterial blood gas measurement as a tool for monitoring arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure. Possible reasons for the discrepancy with previous studies include small sample size in previous studies, lack of research facilities in service settings, and publication bias against negative studies. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

However, the utility and accuracy of the portable <b>capnometer</b> in spontaneously breathing patients with or without chronic pulmonary diseases has received little recognition. To determine {{the utility of the}} portable <b>capnometer</b> in general wards and in in-home care, we examined the correlation between ETCO 2 measured by a portable <b>capnometer</b> and simultaneous P aCO 2 measured in 41 spontaneously breathing patients. TV-ETCO 2 (ETCO 2 measured by tidal volume maneuver) was lower than P aCO 2 by an average of 9. 0 mmHg and VC-ETCO 2 (ETCO 2 measured by vital capacity maneuver) was lower than P aCO 2 by an average of 0. 5 mmHg. The mean difference between P aCO 2 and VC-ETCO 2 was not statistically significant. Regression analysis showed a close correlation between VC-ETCO 2 and P aCO 2 (r = 0. 91, P < 0. 0001). Thus, VC-ETCO 2 was highly correlated with P aCO 2. Furthermore, a close correlation between VC-ETCO 2 and P aCO 2 was also observed in patients with compromised pulmonary function (r = 0. 88, P < 0. 0001 in patients with below 70 % of FEV 1. 0 %; r = 0. 89, P < 0. 0001 in patients with below 80 % of %VC).

40|$|Editor’s {{key points}} † The RRaTM {{is a new}} {{acoustic}} monitoring device which can monitor respiratory rate. † This study compared the RRaTM with capnometry in extubated patients after surgery. † There was close correlation and reasonable limits of agreement between the two devices. Background. Respiratory rate should be monitored continuously in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) to avoid any delay in the detection of respiratory depression. Capnometry is the standard of care but in extubated patients requires a nasal cannula or a face mask that may be poorly tolerated or can be dislodged, leading to errors in data acquisition and false alarms. The value of a new non-invasive acoustic monitor in this setting has not been fully investigated. Methods. Adult patients admitted to the PACU after general anaesthesia were included. After tracheal extubation, an adhesive sensor with an integrated acoustic transducer (RRaTM) {{was placed on the}} patient’s throat and connected to its monitor while the patient breathed through a face mask with a carbon dioxide sampling port (CapnomaskTM) connected to a <b>capnometer.</b> Both the acoustic monitor and the <b>capnometer</b> were connected to a computer to record one pair of data per second for up to 60 min. Results. Fifty-two patients, mean (range) age 54 (22 – 84) yr and BMI 26 (19 – 39) kg m 22, were studied. Compared with capnometry, the bias and limits of agreement of the acoustic method were 0 (21. 4 – 1. 4) bpm. The acoustic sensor was well tolerated while the face mask was removed by eight patients, leading to study discontinuation in two patients. Conclusions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Given growing {{evidence}} that respiratory dysregulation {{is a central}} feature of panic disorder (PD) interventions for panic that specifically target respiratory functions could prove clinically useful and scientifically informative. We tested {{the effectiveness of a}} new, brief, capnometry-assisted breathing therapy (BRT) on clinical and respiratory measures in PD. METHODS: Thirty-seven participants with PD with or without agoraphobia were randomly assigned to BRT or to a delayed-treatment control group. Clinical status, respiration rate, and end-tidal pCO(2) were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, 2 -month and 12 -month follow-up. Respiratory measures were also assessed during homework exercises using a portable <b>capnometer</b> as a feedback device. RESULTS: Significant improvements (in PD severity, agoraphobic avoidance, anxiety sensitivity, disability, and respiratory measures) were seen in treated, but not untreated patients, with moderate to large effect sizes. Improvements were maintained at follow-up. Treatment compliance was high for session attendance and homework exercises; dropouts were few. CONCLUSIONS: The data provide preliminary evidence that raising end-tidal pCO(2) by means of capnometry feedback is therapeutically beneficial for panic patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Since {{there is}} a growing use of {{analgesia}} and sedation in spontaneously breathing patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic interventions, recommendations by national societies of anesthesiologists call for the application of capnometry during all anesthetic procedures. METH-ODS: We compared readings from a transcutaneous <b>capnometer</b> (Tosca) and an end-tidal cap-nometer (Microcap Plus) to PaCO 2 measurements made via arterial-blood-gas analysis. We studied 30 spontaneously breathing patients who were recovering from general anesthesia, and we used Bland Altman analysis to compare the capnometry readings to the arterial-blood-gas values. Ex-piratory gas samples for end-tidal capnometry were taken either from a conventional face mask or an oral/nasal cannula. RESULTS: The Tosca significantly overestimates PaCO 2 (mean SD differ-ence 5. 6 3. 4 mm Hg). The Microcap Plus significantly underestimates PaCO 2 (mean SD dif-ference 14. 1 7. 4 mm Hg).

30|$|An {{alternative}} may be “VCO 2 -based calorimetry” where EE {{is calculated}} only from VCO 2, routinely measured by capnometers {{connected to the}} ventilatory circuit in mechanically ventilated patients [19]. In this paper, we investigate a method to calculate the VCO 2 -based EE from a modified Weir equation [3]: EE(VCO 2) = ((5.5  min/ml · RQ− 1  +  1.76  min/ml) · VCO 2  −  26)kcal/day [20]. In a clinical application of VCO 2 -based calorimetry where VO 2 is not measured, the respiratory quotient (RQ) for the individual patient is unknown and a value of RQ for the individual patient must therefore be chosen.

These authors developed a light and low dead space airway adaptor of end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (PETCO 2) and evaluated the correlations between PETCO 2 and partial CO 2 pressure (PaCO 2) in rabbits while changing tidal volume and leakage volume. Methods: Firstly, Japanese rabbits weighing 2 kg were divided into three tidal volumes (6 mL/kg, 10 mL/kg, or 15 mL/kg), and PETCO 2 and PaCO 2 were measured.

This study was designed to assess the accuracy, precision and repeatability of the proposed FRC measurement system during stable ventilation. Methods: Accuracy and precision of measurements were assessed by comparing the CO 2 rebreathing FRC values to the gold standard, body plethysmography, in nine spontaneously breathing volunteers. Repeatability was assessed by comparing subsequent measurements in nine intensive care patients whose lungs were under mechanical ventilation. The accuracy and precision of the CO 2 FRC measurement during mechanical ventilation were then compared to the reference method, modified multiple breath nitrogen washout, in the same ICU patients. Results: Compared to body plethysmography, the accuracy (mean bias) of the CO 2 method was - 0. 085 L and precision (1 standard deviation) was 0. 033 L (- 2. 3 ± 9. 2 % of body plethysmography). The accuracy in the mechanically ventilated patients was - 0. 055 L and precision was 0. 336 L (- 2. 6 % ± 17. 5 % of nitrogen washout).

40|$|Control of {{breathing}} in humans is regulated through {{a network of}} different nervous and chemical mechanisms, in {{the central nervous system}} as well as in peripheral structures. One important stimulus for this control is the decrease in arterial oxygen tension, PaO 2, in blood, which leads to an increased ventilation. Earlier studies have shown, that anesthetic levels of volatile anesthetic agents abolish the hypoxic ventilatory responses (HVR) in humans. The main aims of the present thesis were: to find out if acute HVR was abolished during isoflurane anesthesia and to determine if the awake biphasic ventilatory response to sustained isocapnic hypoxia was persistent during isoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia and to quantify the extent of depression of these agents on both acute and sustained isocapnic HVR's. Influences of anesthetic and subanesthetic (sedation) levels of volatile anesthetic agents were investigated on healthy female patients (n = 38) and female (n = 8) and male (n = 8) volunteers. The studies were performed with both poikilocapnic and isocapnic hypoxic provocation techniques. Hypoxia was always introduced rapidly with one abrupt step from normoxia to hypoxia. Both acute and sustained ventilatory responses were investigated. All individual awake and anesthetized or sedated studies were performed on the same day during the same session with the awake study always before the anesthetized or sedated. In the awake state, ventilation variables were recorded with the subjects breathing normally through a transparent tight-fitting face mask covering nose and mouth. Anesthesia was induced by propofol. A free airway was secured and the patients were allowed to resume spontaneous breathing via a non-rebreathing anesthesia circuit. Measurements during anesthesia were performed after at least 45 minutes of isoflurane or sevoflurane administration for equilibration. In all studies an in-line infra-red <b>capnometer</b> and a pneumotachograph were placed in the circuit dead-space. Minute ventilation (VE) was measured by integration of the flow signal from the pneumotachograph. Flow (V), tidal volume (VT) and end-tidal CO 2 -tension (PECO 2) were recorded. Inspired and expired concentrations Of CO 2 and O 2 as well as inspired and expired concentrations of isoflurane and sevoflurane were continuously recorded along with percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO 2), heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR). The most important finding in this thesis was that hypoxic ventilatory responses are maintained but depressed by anesthetic levels of isoflurane and sevoflurane using isocapnic hypoxic provocations. When a poikilocapnic hypoxic challenge was studied hypoxic ventilatory responses were, however, unaffected by isoflurane anesthesia. The awake biphasic ventilatory response to hypoxia was maintained during anesthesia...|$|E
40|$|This {{randomized}} {{clinical study}} compares {{the use of}} the endotracheal tube (golden standard) with the new laryngeal mask, the V-gel, in spontaneous breathing cats under isoflurane anesthesia, in respect to isoflurane leakage, ease of use and irritation of the upper respiratory system after surgery. Material/Methods: All cats were admitted for spaying or castration and were classified as ASA- 1 or ASA- 2 patient. Ten cats in the V-gel group and eleven cats in the ET-group. The cats premedicated with 20 µg/kg of dexmedetomidine and 15 µg/kg buprenorphine IM. Induction started with propofol, dosed to effect. For analgesic purposes the cats received 0. 2 mg/kg metacam before surgery and 0. 05 mg/kg/day metacam per os by their owners, the first four days following surgery. The following variables were measured: -Required dose of propofol necessary for intubation or placing the V-gel; -Time between induction and recording of a first capnogram in seconds; -Detection of leakage of isoflurane to the environment measured with the Miran 205 B Type Saphiree 100 isoflurane analizer; -Post-operative discomfort of the upper respiratory system, subjectively scored by the researcher during the recovery. -Post-operative discomfort of the upper respiratory system, subjectively scored with the owner 24 hours after surgery, by means of a questionnaire. The variables were tested by the Student-T-test and the discomfort was being tested by the Chi-Square test. The level of significance was set to P< 0. 05. Results: There was no significant difference when comparing the required dose propofol, ET-group (8. 29 ± 2. 37 mg) and V-gel group (6. 61 ± 2. 93 mg). There was a significant difference regarding the time between induction and first reading on the <b>capnometer.</b> Where the V-gel group had a shorter induction time (52. 59 ± 30. 47 sec.) compared to the ET-group (117. 27 ± 27. 47 sec.). Both groups showed some leakage of the isoflurane, V-gel group (9. 89 ± 10. 47 mg/m 3) and ET-group (9. 65 ± 15. 09 mg/m 3), but no significant difference was found. During recovery six cats from the ET-group were found with an upper airway stridor. According to the Chi-Square test, there were statistically significant fewer cats with an upper airway stridor in the V-gel group (Chi-Square test= 7. 636364; p= 0. 005720; df= 1). The discomfort scored by the owners showed no significant difference between both groups. Conclusion: The V-gel is easy to use and a good alternative for endotracheal intubation in spontaneous breathing cats under isoflurane anesthesia...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} {{presented}} bachelor thesis is ventilation support in prehospital care and during transport of the patient. Consciousness, breathing and blood circulation belong among basic life functions. Thanks to ventilation support {{we are able}} to provide full or partial pulmonary ventilation. For this we use aids such as resuscitation masks meant for lay public or aids for trained paramedics like laryngeal masks, endotracheal tube and ventilator for artificial pulmonary ventilation. Prehospital care is not only about professional first aid, but about giving first aid by lay public as well. That is why aids for pulmonary ventilation are included in this thesis. This bachelor thesis had two aims; to map and compare knowledge of students attending the last year of high school in kiss of life and map experiences of paramedics with a laryngeal mask Supreme and capnometry. The research was implemented with mixed method research. Knowledge of students were found out by tests which were give in class "Z 4 " at Střední odborná škola veterinární, mechanizační a zahradnická a Jazyková škola s právem státní jazykové zkoušy and in class " 4. B" Gymnázium Jírovcova. At Z 4 class research took place on 14 th March 2014. There were 25 students in this class, 4 men and 21 women. At class of 4. B students' knowledge was tested on 2 nd April 2014 with presence of 26 students, 16 women and 10 men. At the beginning of test the anonymity of respondents was stressed, and then all respondents were acquainted with the character of my research and its aim. At the start of the test there were two statistic questions; if the respondent is either man or woman and whether the respondent has his/her driving license. There were 15 closed questions in the test and students were supposed to choose one right. After handing all the tests, the correct results were told to students. 51 tests altogether were given. Experiences of paramedic with the laryngeal mask and capnometry were found out in a form of five short dialogues in a week from 7 th to 11 th April 2014. The research group include paramedics of Zdravotnická záchranná služba Jihočeského kraje. Gained data from tests were evaluated, each question separately and then transformed in graphs which show the number of wrong and right answers. The aim of this thesis was to map and compare knowledge of students {{in the last year of}} their studies. Evaluated tests show us, that students of Z 4 class have more knowledge about kiss of life or with cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In seven questions these students were more successful than their same-age colleagues from Gymnázium, who were better at three questions only. Experiences of paramedic with laryngeal masks Supreme are positive and if ensuring of air passages is needed, when a doctor is not present, they choose LMA Supreme. Paramedics agreed on that following ventilation via LMA Supreme is sufficient as long as we choose the right size. Paramedics ask for <b>capnometer</b> device in all cars EMS. Paramedics of the research group do not daily meet patients who would need or used at controlled ventilation. Students of the last year at high school have basic knowledge about kiss of life or about giving first aid. This knowledge is not 100 % and teaching of giving first aid should be as a subject at high schools. Paramedics accept new aids and machines and use them during their practise. Thanks to this, first aid is becoming more beneficial for patients and for paramedics...|$|E
