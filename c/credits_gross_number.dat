40|$|The paper {{estimates}} <b>gross</b> <b>credit</b> flows for the U.

To investigate the macroeconomic dimensions of <b>gross</b> <b>credit</b> flows, the paper studies the cyclical behavior of aggregate credit flows and documents three key cyclical facts. First, excess credit reallocation is countercyclical: for any given rate of change of net <b>credit,</b> <b>gross</b> flows are larger in a recession than in a boom. Second, <b>gross</b> <b>credit</b> flows are highly volatile, with a cyclical volatility which appears more than {{an order of magnitude}} larger than GDP volatility. Third, credit contraction is more volatile than credit expansion. Furthermore, the behavior of gross flows over the 1991 recession suggests that persistent and historically high credit contraction is a key feature of the relatively mild cyclical downturn. The results lends some support to aggregate models that emphasize the asymmetric behavior of credit expansion and credit contractions. Address...|$|R

40|$|MBA 2014 ABSTRACT This study {{examines}} the behaviour of credit extension over the economic cycle in South Africa to assess its usefulness {{as a common}} reference guide for implementing the countercyclical capital buffers for financial institutions in South Africa, paying {{special attention to the}} recent proposals of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision at the Bank for International Settlements has identified credit extension as one of the major causes of the financial crises. It therefore came up with several proposals in the form of Basel III to strengthen the financial system to make it more resilient to future financial crises. One of the key proposals of Basel III is to implement the countercyclical capital buffers for financial institutions using credit extension as a common reference guide to limit credit procyclicality and its associated systemic and economic risks. This study seeks to establish how the proposed reference guide for setting countercyclical buffers that is based on the gap between the ratio of aggregate private sector <b>credit</b> to <b>gross</b> domestic product gap and its long term trend behaves during periods of expansions and contractions in the economic cycle. The study also seeks to establish how this common reference guide for setting countercyclical capital buffers behaves during periods of upturns and downturns in the economic cycle. The empirical results reveal a statistically significant positive relationship of the gap between the ratio of aggregate private sector <b>credit</b> to <b>gross</b> domestic product and its long term trend relative to its recent past during the busts in the economic cycle, while such a relationship cannot be established during the periods of economic cycle booms. The empirical results further reveal a statistically significant positive relationship of the gap between the ratio of aggregate private sector <b>credit</b> to <b>gross</b> domestic product and its long term trend relative to its recent past during the downturns in the economic cycle, while such relationship turns negative during the economic cycle upturns. The conclusion is that the use of the proposed common reference guide to determine the level of the countercyclical capital buffers for financial institutions may not be appropriate in South Africa given that it would tend to increase capital requirements during the economic downturns, exacerbating the procyclicality of credit extension with dire consequences for the economy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the empirical and theoretical knowledge of <b>gross</b> <b>credit</b> flows: the simultaneous process of credit expansion and contraction associated with a net change in the aggregate quantity of credit. Empirically, the paper summarizes heterogeneity in the banking industry by estimating <b>gross</b> <b>credit</b> flows for the entire US banking system between 1979 and 1999. The empirical exercise shows that sizeable gross flows coexist at any phase of the cycle, even within narrowly defined regional units and bank size categories. Furthermore, the paper finds that aggregate credit contraction is a concentrated series, which implies that a burst in credit contraction is followed by prolonged periods of low contraction. Theoretically, the paper proposes a matching model in which financiers have to spend time and resources to expand credit to heterogeneous entrepreneurs. The outcome of the model resulting from the combination of idiosyncratic shocks and asymmetric adjustment to positive and negative aggregate shocks appears consistent with the empirical properties of aggregate credit flows.
