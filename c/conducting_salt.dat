However, this method has some drawbacks, which make their application as industrial processes economically unfeasible. Especially, the by now very low achieved productivities, which result from the low conductivity of the used aqueous reaction media, represent a major challenge. Therefore within this thesis, the potential of ionic liquids as <b>conducting</b> <b>salts</b> for electroenzymatic synthesis was explored. For three different, but typical electroenzymatic syntheses, influences of ionic liquids on the activity and stability of the biocatalyst, on the solubility of the used substrates, on the conductivity of the reaction medium {{as well as on}} the involved electrochemical reaction step were investigated. These examples showed that not only the conductivity of the reaction medium was improved, but also some other advantages can be achieved by the application of ionic liquids. Additionally, it is possible to stabilize the biocatalyst and reduced nicotinamide cofactors and to increase the solubility of hardly water soluble substrates. Depending on the reaction system, this results in optimized space time yields and turnover frequencies for the applied mediators and in addition to that, in improved biocatalyst utilizations. Moreover, for one of the reactions a comparison of conventional <b>conducting</b> <b>salts</b> and ionic liquids was drawn, showing clear benefits for the usage of ionic liquids.
