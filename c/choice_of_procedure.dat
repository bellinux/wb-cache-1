Earlier, in Knight v.

Furthermore, preliminary decisions will generally not trigger the duty to act fairly, but decisions of a more final nature may have such an effect. In addition, whether a duty to act fairly applies depends on the relationship between the public authority and the individual. No duty exists where the relationship is one of master and servant, or where the individual holds office at the pleasure of the authority. On the other hand, a duty to act fairly exists where the individual cannot be removed from office except for cause. Finally, a right to procedural fairness only exists when an authority's decision is significant and has an important impact on the individual.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the impact of {{structure}} of dependency and the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> for rare-event simulation on the pricing of multi-name credit derivatives such as nth to default swap and Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO). The correlation between names defaulting has an effect on the value of the basket credit derivatives. We present a copula based simulation procedure for pricing basket default swaps and CDO under different structure of dependency and assessing the influence of different price drivers (correlation, hazard rates and recovery rates) on modelling portfolio losses. Gaussian copulas and Monte Carlo simulation is widely used to measure the default risk in basket credit derivatives. Default risk is often considered as a rare-event and then, many studies have shown that many distributions have fatter tails than those captured by the normal distribution. Subsequently, the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> copula and the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> for rare-event simulation govern the pricing of basket credit derivatives. An alternative to the Gaussian copula is Clayton copula and t-student copula under importance sampling procedures for simulation which captures the dependence structure between the underlying variables at extreme values and certain values of the input random variables in a simulation have more impact on the parameter being estimated than others. ...|$|R

40|$|In an {{application}} of procedural justice theory (Lind & Tyler, 1988; Tyler, 1989) to the domain of intergroup relations, we investigated justice preferences among members of numerical majority and minority groups {{as a function of}} two parameters: the number of representatives allotted to each group, and the decision rule used to determine the outcome (ranging from simple majority vote to unanimity). In the first study, minority group members perceived the combination of proportional representation and majority vote to be significantly less fair than all other combinations, and their <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> stressed "mutual control" (when the decision rule exceeds the number of representatives possessed by either group). In a second study, majority group members perceived the combination of equal representation and majority vote to be significantly less fair than other <b>procedures,</b> but their <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> did involve a considerable degree of mutual control. These findings suggest that there may be some basis for agreement between majority and minority group members' justice preferences and that both groups may perceive situations of mutual control to be acceptable. A third study involving both majority and minority group members ruled out an interpretation of the previous results in terms of motivation to maintain vs. change the status quo.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: This {{study is}} a {{retrospective}} analysis of 50 phyllodes tumours to determine the optimal surgical procedure for these types of tumours. We have also reviewed rates of recurrence, metastases and mortality based on <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> and histological type. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases were ascertained from pathology databases and clinical details extracted from the hospital records. Fifty patients with phyllodes tumours were identified. These comprised 29 benign, 12 borderline and 9 malignant phyllodes tumours. RESULTS: All benign phyllodes tumours were treated with breast-conserving surgery, these included 16 tumours over 40 mm. Borderline and malignant lesions were treated by breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy. The median follow-up period was 35 months (range, 4 - 96 months). The recurrence rate for all tumours was 14 %. Malignant and borderline phyllodes tumours had a recurrence rate of 28 %. Tumours excised with a wide margin {{did not seem to}} recur. Breast-conserving surgery appeared to be as effective as mastectomy. The <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> was less important than the width of the excision margin. Recurrence occurred in 1 / 29 benign tumours. Excision margin width did not influence rate of recurrence. One patient died of metastases after mastectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Breast-conserving surgery is the treatment of choice for all benign lesions. For borderline and malignant lesions, excision with a wide margin reduces the rate of recurrence. If a diagnostic local excision biopsy or enucleation is performed, it should be followed by a definitive wider excision...|$|E
40|$|Global {{sensitivity}} analysis {{can be used}} to identify and rank variables importance (sensitivities) for design objectives and constraints, where the solution space is sampled and a linear regression model is normally adopted in the stepwise manner. The relative importance of variables can be examined by three indicators: the order of variables entry into the linear regression model; the absolute values of the standardized regression coefficients or their rank transformation coefficients; {{and the size of the}} R 2 changes (coefficient of determination) attributable to additional variables at each step. However, the robustness of the linear regression model constructed from a stepwise regression is related to the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> options, e. g. the set of samples and data formulation. Different procedure options could lead to different linear regression models, and therefore influence the indication of variables global sensitivities. Thus, this paper investigates the extent to which the procedure options of a stepwise regression can influence the indication of variables global sensitivities, measured by three different sensitivity indicators, for energy demand, capital costs and solution infeasibility, when using both the randomly generated samples and the biased solutions obtained at the start of a multi-objective optimization process (based on NSGA-II).
