40|$|Background. Despite {{substantial}} {{progress toward}} eradication of poliomyelitis, {{the risk of}} poliomyelitis out-breaks resulting from virus importations into polio-free areas persists. We reviewed the changing epidemiology of outbreaks {{in the final stages}} of the eradication initiative. Methods. Available literature on outbreaks of poliomyelitis caused by wild polioviruses between 1996 and 2012 was reviewed. Results. During this period, there were 22 outbreaks involving 39 countries. Outbreaks ranged in size from 1 to 1335 cases. These outbreaks caused 4571 cases, representing 21 % of all cases reported during this period. Five out-breaks involved multiple countries. In 76 % of outbreaks (16 / 21) with a known age distribution, cases concentrated among children aged < 5 years; in 19 % (4 / 21), most cases were among adolescents and adults. The outbreaks among adolescents and adults were associated with higher <b>case-fatality</b> <b>ratios,</b> ranging from 12 % in Albania in 1994 to 41 % in the Republic of Congo in 2010. The majority of outbreaks were controlled within 6 months with oral poliovirus vaccine. Conclusions. Importations resulting in epidemic transmission of wild poliovirus caused thousands of cases of pa-ralysis often in countries where poliomyelitis had not occurred for many years.

40|$|Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a {{major public}} health burden worldwide. We aimed to review the current {{literature}} on the incidence and mortality of severe RSV in children globally. Methods: Systematic literature review and meta-analysis of published data from 2000 onwards, reporting on burden of acute respiratory infection (ARI) due to RSV in children. Main outcomes were hospitalization for severe RSV-ARI and death. Results: Five thousand two hundred and seventy-four references were identified. Fifty-five studies were included from 32 countries. The global RSV-ARI hospitalization estimates, reported per 1, 000 children per year (95 % Credible Interval (CrI), were 4. 37 (2. 98, 6. 42) among children < 5 years, 19. 19 (15. 04, 24. 48) among children < 1 year, 20. 01 (9. 65, 41. 31) among children < 6 months and 63. 85 (37. 52, 109. 70) among premature children < 1 year. The RSV-ARI global case-fatality estimates, reported per 1, 000 children, (95 % Crl) were 6. 21 (2. 64, 13. 73) among children < 5 years, 6. 60 (1. 85, 16. 93) for children < 1 year, and 1. 04 (0. 17, 12. 06) among preterm children < 1 year. Conclusions: A substantial proportion of RSV-associated morbidity occurs {{in the first year}} of life, especially in children born prematurely. These data affirm the importance of RSV disease in the causation of hospitalization and as a significant contributor to pediatric mortality and further demonstrate gestational age as a critical determinant of disease severity. An important limitation of <b>case-fatality</b> <b>ratios</b> is the absence of individual patient characteristics of non-surviving patients.

50|$|A <b>case-fatality</b> <b>ratio</b> {{based on}} an {{accurate}} and all-inclusive count of cases would be invaluable, but unfortunately {{it is impossible to}} attain. The ability to diagnose every case of H5N1 as it arises does not exist. A few small reported studies have attempted to gather preliminary data on this crucial statistic, by carrying out systematic blood testing of neighbors and contacts of fatal cases in villages where there had been confirmed H5N1 fatalities. In most cases, this testing failed to turn up any overlooked mild cases, though in at least one study mild overlooked cases were identified. These methodical studies of contacts provide significant evidence that the high death rate among confirmed cases in the villages where these studies were carried out cannot be simply attributed to a wholesale failure to detect mild cases. Unfortunately, these studies are likely to remain too few and sketchy to define the complex situation worldwide regarding the lethality of the varying H5N1 clades. The testing and reporting necessary for mass serology studies to determine the incidence of overlooked cases for each existing clade and strain of H5N1 worldwide would be prohibitively costly.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute {{onset of}} {{jaundice}} {{and a high}} <b>case-fatality</b> <b>ratio</b> in pregnant women. We provide a clinical description of hospitalized case patients and assess the specific impact on pregnant women during a large epidemic of HEV infection in a displaced population in Mornay camp (78, 800 inhabitants), western Darfur, Sudan. METHODS: We reviewed hospital records. A sample of 20 clinical cases underwent laboratory confirmation. These patients were tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to HEV (serum) and for amplification of the HEV genome (serum and stool). We performed a cross-sectional survey in the community to determine the attack rate and <b>case-fatality</b> <b>ratio</b> in pregnant women. RESULTS: Over 6 months, 253 HEV cases were recorded at the hospital, of which 61 (24. 1 %) were in pregnant women. A total of 72 cases (39. 1 % of those for whom clinical records were available) had a diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. Of the 45 who died (<b>case-fatality</b> <b>ratio,</b> 17. 8 %), 19 were pregnant women (specific <b>case-fatality</b> <b>ratio,</b> 31. 1 %). Acute hepatitis E was confirmed in 95 % (19 / 20) of cases sampled; 18 case-patients were positive for IgG (optical density ratio > or = 3), for IgM (optical density ratio > 2), or for both, whereas 1 was negative for IgG and IgM but positive for HEV RNA in serum. The survey identified 220 jaundiced women among the 1133 pregnant women recorded over 3 months (attack rate, 19. 4 %). A total of 18 deaths were recorded among these jaundiced pregnant women (specific <b>case-fatality</b> <b>ratio,</b> 8. 2 %). CONCLUSIONS: This large epidemic of HEV infection illustrates the dramatic impact of this disease on pregnant women.

Methods: Using a prospective data base we analyzed the <b>case-fatality</b> <b>ratio,</b> early mortality, and the incidences of hypertension and anticoagulant medication in 488 consecutive cases with supratentorial hemorrhage between 1978 and 1989. Blood pressure at admission of all patients for the years 1978 - 1979 and 1988 - 1989 and the Mathew and {{activities of daily living}} scores for the years 1978 - 1979, 1982 - 1983, and 1988 - 1989 were assessed retrospectively. Results: The <b>case-fatality</b> <b>ratio</b> decreased from 49 % in the period 1978 - 1981 to 31 % in 1986 - 1989 (p= 0. 006); early mortality (day 1 - 4) decreased from 28 % to 12 % (p= 0. 0017). The incidence of hypertension decreased from 78 % in the period 1978 - 1981 to 64 % in 1986 - 1989 (p= 0. 01). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure at admission sank (/?= 0. 09). The decrease of the <b>case-fatality</b> <b>ratio</b> correlated best with a less severe initial disturbance of consciousness (p< 0. 01) and with a higher Mathew score (p= 0. 038). The activities of daily living score remained unchanged. Conclusions: The <b>case-fatality</b> <b>ratio</b> and early mortality decreased after the introduction of computed tomography. This was basically due to a decreased incidence of comatose and stuporous patients with severe neurological deficit paralleled by a decrease of mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure values at admission.

Historically, measles <b>case-fatality</b> <b>ratios</b> (CFRs) {{have been reported}} to vary from 0. 1 % in the developed world to as high as 30 % in emergency settings.

Households spent US $ 90 per meningitis case, or 34 % of the annual gross domestic product per capita, and up to US $ 154 more when meningitis sequelae occurred. Much of this cost was attributable to direct medical expenses, which in theory are paid by the government.

Microscopic analysis of the thick blood film is the cornerstone of laboratory diagnosis. For pragmatic reasons, EDTA-anticoagulated blood is accepted, provided that slides are prepared within 1 h after collection. Information about the Plasmodium species (in particular P. falciparum versus the non-falciparum species) and the parasite density is essential for patient management. Molecular methods in reference settings are an adjunct for species differentiation. Signals generated by automated hematology analyzers may trigger {{the diagnosis of}} malaria in nonsuspected cases. Malaria rapid diagnostic tests are reliable in the diagnosis of P. falciparum but not for the detection of the non-falciparum species. They do not provide information about parasite density and should be used as an adjunct (an...|$|R
40|$|European Union Invasive Bacterial Infection Surveillance participants: Paula Lavado (Departamento de Doenças Infecciosas do INSA) An {{international}} collaboration {{was established}} in 1996 to monitor the impact of routine Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccination on invasive H. influenzae disease; 14 countries routinely serotype all clinical isolates. Of the 10, 081 invasive H. influenzae infections reported during 1996 - 2006, 4, 466 (44 %, incidence 0. 28 infections/ 100, 000 population) were due to noncapsulated H. influenzae (ncHi); 2, 836 (28 %, 0. 15 / 100, 000), to Hib; and 690 (7 %, 0. 036 / 100, 000), to non-b encapsulated H. influenzae. Invasive ncHi infections occurred in older persons more often than Hib (median age 58 years vs. 5 years, p< 0. 0001) and were associated with higher <b>case-fatality</b> <b>ratios</b> (12 % vs. 4 %, p< 0. 0001), particularly in infants (17 % vs. 3 %, p< 0. 0001). Among non-b encapsulated H. influenzae, types f (72 %) and e (21 %) were responsible for almost all cases; the overall case-fatality rate was 9 %. Thus, the incidence of invasive non-type b H. influenzae is now {{higher than that of}} Hib and is associated with higher case fatality.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The 92 capsular serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae differ {{greatly in}} nasopharyngeal {{carriage}} prevalence, invasiveness, and disease incidence. There {{has been some}} debate, though, regarding whether serotype independently affects the outcome of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Published studies have shown variable results with regard to <b>case-fatality</b> <b>ratios</b> for specific serotypes {{and the role of}} host factors in affecting these relationships. We evaluated whether risk of death due to IPD is a stable serotype-associated property across studies and then compared the pooled effect estimates with epidemiologic and biological correlates. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of serotype-specific disease outcomes for patients with pneumonia and meningitis. Study-specific estimates of risk of death (risk ratio [RR]) were pooled from 9 studies that provided serotype-specific data on pneumonia and meningitis using a random-effects method with serotype 14 as the reference. Pooled RRs were compared with RRs from adults with low comorbidity scores to evaluate potential confounding by host factors. RESULTS: Significant differences were found in the RR estimates among serotypes in patients with bacteremic pneumonia. Overall, serotypes 1, 7 F, and 8 were associated with decreased RRs, and serotypes 3, 6 A, 6 B, 9 N, and 19 F were associated with increased RRs. Outcomes among meningitis patients did not differ significantly among serotypes. Serotypes with increased RRs had a high carriage prevalence, had low invasiveness, and were more heavily encapsulated in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that IPD outcome, like other epidemiologic measures, is a stable serotype-associated property...|$|R
