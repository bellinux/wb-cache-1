The thesis consists of four parts. A content of the first part is a discussion of the used expressions border, socio-cultural aspects, borderland, <b>cross-border</b> <b>cooperation,</b> and theoretical and methodological framing of issues. The second part aims to explain a historical development of the Slovak-Hungarian borderland. It is essential to understand the historical context that influenced the borderland and its population. The third part of the thesis focuses on an issue of the borderland definition on the basis of socio-cultural aspects, particularly nationality, religion, natives during the 20 th century.

We attempt to identify contexts boundaries to reveal the contextual origins of a country’s competitive assets. We collect data for the three mapping dimensions: identity (geographical scale and polity), functionality (thematic focus of <b>cross-border</b> <b>cooperation,</b> policy <b>areas),</b> and governance (policy space, decision-making, civil society). The geographical focus consists of ten selected European regional groupings.

40|$|With {{the decline}} of the nation state and the {{increasing}} importance of regionalisation, the EU has launched macro-regions, i. e., areas, including territories from several countries, that share common goals and operating under multi-level governance. This paper focuses on the EU territorial cooperation strategy, utilising the concept of „macro- -region” and the perspective of the macro-regional approach. Following the first macro-regions (such as the Baltic Sea Region and the Danube Region), the EU recently launched the Adriatic-Ionian Macro-regional Strategy, which was seen as an additional tool for cooperation between local and regional authorities that overlooks the Adriatic Sea. Nevertheless, future developments in the region appear at the present to be quite uncertain, owing to structural industrial decline, rural marginalisation and a lack of infrastructure adequate to support the entire <b>cooperation</b> <b>area.</b> To overcome these constraints, the concept of macro-region must be strengthened by creating alternative ways to engage in <b>cross-border</b> <b>cooperation</b> between <b>areas</b> subject to similar conditions. Matching among regions that belong to different Euro-countries within the framework of a macro- -region may {{be the best way to}} forge a consistent path towards territorial, economic and social integration.

40|$|This Essay {{seeks to}} expose the {{complexity}} {{of the relationship between the}} United Kingdom (and Ireland, but the main focus will be the UK) and the European Union that resulted from the concessions made to the UK when the treaties of Amsterdam and Lisbon were negotiated: a right not to participate in the adoption and application of EU legislative measures in the field of Justice and Home Affairs (2 ̆ 2 JHA 2 ̆ 2), and the right to decide on a case-by-case basis to opt into such measures, following procedures reminiscent of the sophisticated rules of cricket. These concessions were made to allow the UK to preserve in particular the right to maintain controls on persons at all its borders and to conduct its own immigration policies. Its discretion to opt in or opt out has been somewhat restricted when it concerns measures belonging to or developing the 2 ̆ 2 Schengen acquis. 2 ̆ 2 But that has not stopped the UK from displaying its interest in participating in some parts of the Schengen acquis, so far mainly covering aspects of <b>cross-border</b> <b>cooperation</b> in <b>areas</b> of law enforcement and criminal justice.

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{the paper is the}} {{analysis}} and evaluation of cross-border entrepreneurship development opportunities on the basis of <b>cross-border</b> <b>cooperation,</b> which has gradually evolved from consisting of bilateral partnerships to a networking model or even a cluster. The study conducted at the Polish–Czech border area indicates that, in terms of the development of <b>cross-border</b> <b>cooperation,</b> the economic sphere is lagging far behind social activities such as culture, education and tourism. At the same time, Polish and Czech enterprises are not sufficiently mobilized to develop cross-border entrepreneurship, although a number of support instruments in this regard have been proposed.
