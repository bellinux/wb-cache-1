40|$|AbstractThe {{electric}} golf <b>cart</b> <b>of</b> LIPI {{is designed}} traditionally without calculating geometric and kinematic properties of it steering layout.

So, this paper's purpose is to calculate and make recommendation for electric golf <b>cart</b> <b>of</b> LIPI as a solution for improving the handling quality. The result is that maximum turning angle of the car is limited by 30 ° and the car has R at 372 cm. This is an ideal value according to Ackerman calculation...|$|R
