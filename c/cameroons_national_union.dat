50|$|François Sengat-Kuo {{completed}} {{elementary education}} at the Ecole Principale D’Akwa (Douala). He attended secondary school at the Lycée Leclerc (Yaoundé) and the Lyc.ée Pierre d’Ailly (Compiegne - France). An eminence grise of the late <b>Cameroon</b> <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> (UNC), his political engagement can be felt in his poetry. A militant of the Association of Students of Black Africa in France (FEANF), his work is laced with observations of the political landscape of Cameroon at the time. Editor of the journal Presence Africaine, he published numerous articles under the pseudonym Nditsouna Francisco.|$|R
50|$|Ekindi {{was born}} in Douala. Early in his {{political}} career, {{he was a member}} of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (UPC). He was politically active while studying in France, and he was arrested for political reasons in 1970 when he returned to Cameroon for a visit. After nearly two years in prison, he was released and resumed his studies in France. When the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) was created as the governing party in 1985, replacing the <b>Cameroon</b> <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> (CNU), Ekindi joined the party, encouraged by President Paul Biya's promises of reform.|$|R
50|$|Ndongo Essomba, a businessman, was the Third Vice-President of the Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Mines (Chambre de commerce, d'industrie et des mines, CCIM) as of 1984.

5000|$|In June 1966 President Ahidjo {{called a}} conference that {{included}} {{the leaders of the}} two main political parties, the KNDP and CPNC and the Prime Ministers of West and East Cameroon.The participants decided to [...] "reinforce national unity" [...] by merging their parties into one, the <b>Cameroon</b> <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> (In French: Union Nationale Camerounaise - UNC).The new party came into legal existence on 1 September 1966, with Ahidjo as President and Tchoungui one of two vice-presidents.Elections were held for the Federal and East Cameroon governments on 7 June 1970 and were won by the UNC candidates, as expected.On 12 June 1970 Tchoungui was reappointed Prime Minister of Eastern Cameroun. He left this post on 20 May 1972 when the United Republic of Cameroon was declared.|$|R
50|$|Born in Mada, {{located in}} the Tokombéré {{arrondissement}} of Mayo-Sava Department in the Far North Region, Cavayé {{is a member of}} the Mada ethnic group. He studied at the regional center for physical and sports education from 1960 to 1963 and subsequently worked as a teacher in Maroua. He was then appointed as Interdepartmental Inspector of the Far North in 1965, and he entered the Legislative Assembly of East Cameroon in April 1970; he also became the traditional chief of the Mada in 1971. Following the creation of a unitary state, Cavayé was elected to the <b>National</b> Assembly of <b>Cameroon</b> in 1973 and obtained the position of Questor in the Bureau of the National Assembly. In 1975, he was included in the Central Committee of the <b>Cameroon</b> <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> (CNU) ruling party.|$|R
50|$|His {{political}} party, the <b>Cameroon</b> <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> (CNU), {{became the}} sole legal political party on 1 September 1966 and in 1972, {{the federal system}} of government was abolished in favour of a United Republic of Cameroon, headed from Yaoundé. Ahidjo pursued an economic policy of planned liberalism, prioritising cash crops and petroleum development. The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve, pay farmers, and finance major development projects; however, many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them.Ahidjo stepped down on 4 November 1982 and left power to his constitutional successor, Paul Biya. However, Ahidjo remained {{in control of the}} CNU and tried to run the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning. Biya began his administration by moving toward a more democratic government, but a failed coup d'état nudged him toward the leadership style of his predecessor.|$|R
5000|$|Because Biya is a Christian {{from south}} region of Cameroon, it was {{considered}} surprising that he was chosen by Ahidjo, a Muslim from the north, as his successor. After Biya became President, Ahidjo initially remained head of the ruling <b>Cameroon</b> <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> (CNU). Biya was brought into the CNU Central Committee and Political Bureau and was elected as the Vice-President of the CNU. On 11 December 1982, he was placed in charge of managing party affairs in Ahidjo's absence. During the first months after Biya's succession, he continued to show loyalty to Ahidjo, and Ahidjo continued to show support for Biya, but in 1983 a deep rift developed between the two. Ahidjo went into exile in France, and from there he publicly accused Biya of abuse of power and paranoia about plots against him. The two could not be reconciled despite efforts by several foreign leaders. After Ahidjo resigned as CNU leader, Biya took {{the helm of the}} party at an [...] "extraordinary session" [...] of the CNU party held on 14 September 1983.|$|R
5000|$|Ahidjo resigned, ostensibly {{for health}} reasons, on 4 November 1982 (there are many {{theories}} surrounding the resignation; {{it is generally}} believed that his French doctor [...] "tricked" [...] Ahidjo about his health) and was succeeded by Prime Minister Paul Biya two days later. That he stepped down in favor of Biya, a Christian {{from the south and}} not a Muslim from the north like himself, was considered surprising. Ahidjo's ultimate intentions are unclear; it is possible that he intended to return to the presidency at a later point when his health improved, and another possibility is that he intended for Maigari Bello Bouba, a fellow Muslim from the north who succeeded Biya as Prime Minister, to be his eventual successor as President, with Biya in effectively a caretaker role. Although the Central Committee of the ruling <b>Cameroon</b> <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> (CNU) urged Ahidjo to remain President, he declined to do so, but he did agree to remain as the President of the CNU. However, he also arranged for Biya to become the CNU Vice-President and handle party affairs in his absence. Additionally, in January 1983, Ahidjo travelled across the country in a tour in support of Biya.|$|R
5000|$|Philippe Georges Saint-André ( [...] ; born 19 April 1967) is {{a former}} French rugby union footballer and current coach of the <b>Cameroon</b> <b>national</b> rugby <b>union</b> team. He earned 69 test caps for France between 1990 and 1997. His {{preferred}} position was wing but he could also play at centre. After retiring, Saint-André has found success as a rugby coach in both England and France. He was serving as director of rugby at Toulon before being announced as the successful candidate for head coach of France from 2011 to 2015. He formally {{took charge of the}} national team on 1 December 2011, and left his post on 17 October 2015 following a 13-62 loss to New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|After nearly 23 {{years as}} President of Cameroon, Ahmadou Ahidjo {{resigned}} for unclear reasons in November 1982 and was succeeded by Prime Minister Paul Biya. Despite his resignation, Ahidjo remained President of the <b>Cameroon</b> <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> (CNU), the ruling party, and retained enormous political influence. Although Ahidjo's resignation was voluntary {{and he was}} initially happy to see Biya take his place as President (although Biya was a Christian {{from the south and}} Ahidjo was a Muslim from the north), a power struggle between the two developed in 1983. Ahidjo attempted to assert his supremacy by arguing that the party should make policy decisions and that the state should merely implement them, but Biya in turn pointed out that the constitution assigned responsibility for determining policy to the President of the Republic. Ahidjo went into exile in July 1983, and on August 22, 1983, Biya publicly accused Ahidjo of plotting a coup, while simultaneously dismissing two key Ahidjo loyalists - Prime Minister Maigari Bello Bouba and Minister of State for the Armed Forces Maikano Abdoulaye - from the government. Ahidjo bitterly criticized Biya from exile, accusing him of paranoia and misrule, and he resigned as President of the CNU. In February 1984 he was sentenced to death in absentia for alleged involvement in the 1983 coup plot, although the sentence was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment by Biya.|$|R
50|$|On May 25, 1990, former Prime Minister Maigari Bello Bouba, then in exile, {{announced}} {{the formation of}} a new party, the <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> for Democracy and Progress in Cameroon, in Paris. The party was officially established in <b>Cameroon,</b> as the <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> for Democracy and Progress, at a meeting in Douala on February 9, 1991. A request for the legalization of the party was filed on February 18, and it was accordingly legalized on March 25, 1991. Bello Bouba returned to Cameroon on August 17, 1991. The UNDP's First Ordinary Congress, at which the party's leadership and the membership of its organs was elected, was held on January 4 - 5, 1992 in Garoua. At the Congress, Bello Bouba became President of the UNDP, ousting its previous leader, Samuel Eboua. Eboua subsequently left the UNDP and formed the Movement for Democracy and Progress (MDP). The UNDP is considered by many, including the party itself, to represent the legacy of Ahmadou Ahidjo, who was President of Cameroon from 1960 to 1982.|$|R
