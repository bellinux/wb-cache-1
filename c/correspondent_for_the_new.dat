5|$|Born in Portland, Maine, Willis {{came from}} a family of publishers. His {{grandfather}} Nathaniel Willis owned newspapers in Massachusetts and Virginia, and his father Nathaniel Willis was the founder of Youth's Companion, the first newspaper specifically for children. Willis developed an interest in literature while attending Yale College and began publishing poetry. After graduation, he worked as an overseas <b>correspondent</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York Mirror. He eventually moved to New York and began to build his literary reputation. Working with multiple publications, he was earning about $100 per article and between $5,000 and $10,000 per year. In 1846, he started his own publication, the Home Journal, which was eventually renamed Town & Country. Shortly after, Willis moved to a home on the Hudson River where he lived a semi-retired life until his death in 1867.|$|E
5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington <b>correspondent</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E

Soon after, another Princeton graduate offered him a job at J.P. Morgan Bank. Hired onto a two-year trainee program, Baker earned about $20 per week. Baker befriended a rich New York socialite, Percy R. Pyne II, who had also attended St. Paul's and Princeton. Though ten years older than Baker, they quickly became friends and Pyne allowed Baker to stay at his house at 263 Madison Avenue. Pyne later introduced Baker to Jeanne Marie Scott, a socialite known as Mimi, to whom Baker was briefly engaged late in 1918. A quiet individual, Baker was embarrassed when bank executives brought important clients by his office to see him. He quickly tired of working in an office job, and looked for ways to alleviate his boredom.|$|E

Their column mixed standard reporting with their own editorial opinions. It began with muted, mostly centrist views, but their words drifted rightward over time. Novak's experience covering the Six-Day War in the field influenced his beliefs towards Evans' pro-Palestinian sympathies.|$|E
25|$|The university's {{operations}} on the Mississippi Gulf Coast began in 1947 when Mississippi Southern College first organized classes at Van Hook Hall, on the Methodist Camp Grounds in Biloxi. In 1958, {{the operation was}} moved to Mary L. Michael Junior High School in Biloxi. To meet {{the educational needs of}} various occupational fields, the university relocated in 1964 to Keesler Air Force Base. In addition, it obtained classroom facilities for night classes from the Jefferson Davis campus of the Mississippi Gulf Coast Junior College. It called this complex the USM Harrison County Resident Center. One of the most prominent landmarks on campus is the Friendship Oak. This huge live oak tree on the lawn of Hardy Hall and the Administration Building, dates from approximately 1487. The earliest available reference to the moniker Friendship Oak is found in an article written by Bob Davis, <b>correspondent</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York Sun.

25|$|The Snows' {{marriage}} was strained and the Japanese occupation {{of much of}} China made life difficult. In December 1940, the Snows decided {{to move back to}} the United States in fear that the Japanese would make them prisoners of war. The attack on Pearl Harbor would take place exactly one year later. Prior to their departure, Ed was offered a position as a war <b>correspondent</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York Herald Tribune and Helen encouraged him to take it. She returned to the United States without him. But not much time had passed until Ed realized he didn't want to be without his wife and the living conditions were too difficult for him to withstand much longer. The Snows had been in China for a decade and they were both lacking proper nutrition and vitamins. Nearly the entire time they were in Asia, they did not eat raw foods in order to avoid dysentery and their health was depleted. Upon their initial return to the United States, the couple lived in California for a short time and then moved into a small mid-1700's house in Madison, Connecticut.|$|E

25|$|The area of Andrea Dorias hull where Stockholms bow {{penetrated}} encompassed five passenger decks. On {{the uppermost}} of these decks, the Upper Deck, {{at least eight}} first class cabins were destroyed. In all, six first class passengers lost their lives. In cabin 46, Colonel Walter Carlin {{had been in the}} bathroom brushing his teeth {{at the time of the}} collision and miraculously survived, while his wife Jeanette was killed. In direct line of Stockholms bow on the upper deck were cabins 52 and 54, which were occupied by Camille Cianfarra, a longtime foreign <b>correspondent</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> York Times, his wife Jane, their eight-year-old daughter Joan and 14-year-old Linda Morgan, Jane's daughter from her previous marriage to American journalist Edward P.

Jane was seriously injured, but was rescued by some other passengers, among them Dr. Thure Peterson, who had been next door in cabin 56. He sustained only minor injuries, while his wife Martha was gravely wounded and was trapped along with Jane Cianfarra. After a long struggle to free her, largely on the part of her husband, Martha succumbed to her injuries a few hours after the collision. One deck below on the Foyer Deck, near the first class entrance, Ferdinand Melly Thieriot, circulation director of The San Francisco Chronicle, along with his wife Frances, were killed, as their suite was in direct line of the Stockholms bow. Their 13-year-old son Peter, who occupied a cabin further down the corridor, survived.|$|E

Given the many violations of Deny Flight by helicopters, and the frequent failure of coordination between NATO and the UN, it is uncertain whether Deny Flight accomplished this mission. [...] Nonetheless, NATO's limited air strikes under Deny Flight [...] "demonstrated its determination to protect United Nations personnel" [...] and Bosnian civilians, according to Michael R.

500|$|Between June and December 1860, Benjamin {{was almost}} entirely {{absorbed in the}} case of United States v. Castillero, that was tried in San Francisco during the latter part of that period. The case {{concerned}} a land grant by the former Mexican government of California. Castillero had leased part of his land to British mining companies, and when American authorities ruled the grant invalid, they hired Benjamin; he spent four months in San Francisco working on the case. The trial began in October, and Benjamin gave an address lasting six days. The local <b>correspondent</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York Times wrote that Benjamin, [...] "a distinguished stranger", drew the largest crowds to the courtroom and [...] "the Senator is making this terribly tedious case interesting". Benjamin sailed for New York once the case was submitted for decision in early November. The court's ruling, rendered in January 1861, was substantially for the company but, not satisfied, it appealed. It lost the case entirely to an adverse decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, three justices dissenting, the following year. [...] Benjamin was by then a Confederate Cabinet officer, and could not argue the case. His co-counsel filed his brief with the court.|$|E
