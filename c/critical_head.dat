He picked up another family friend, racer Red Farmer, {{en route to the}} track. Allison was attempting to land the helicopter inside a fenced-in area of the track infield when the craft nosed up suddenly, then crashed. The National Transportation Safety Board blamed the crash on Allison's inexperience in helicopters, coupled with the decision to attempt a landing. Neil Bonnett freed the semi-conscious Farmer from the wreckage, but Allison was unresponsive and could not be freed until paramedics arrived. Farmer went on to a lengthy but successful recovery, but Allison never regained consciousness after sustaining a <b>critical</b> <b>head</b> injury. He was pronounced dead at 7:00a.m. the next morning by a neurosurgeon at Carraway Methodist Medical Center in Birmingham after a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain proved unsuccessful.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Wheat is an {{important}} cereal crop in the Willamette Valley of Oregon and the stiff-strawed, high yielding winter varieties are the predominate types grown although spring varieties are not uncommon. Because of the mild, often open winters; present in the Willamette, {{it is not unusual}} to be able to seed wheat almost every month from early fall until late spring. The purpose of these studies was to determine the cold requirement and <b>critical</b> <b>heading</b> period of some important winter wheat varieties. The cold requirement and <b>critical</b> <b>heading</b> period was measured by determining the extent that each of the winter varieties would develop heads from various planting dates from late fall until early summer. Results were obtained on the percentage of heading for each variety in the 1961 - 62 trial and for heading and yields in bushels per acre in the 1962 - 63 trial. The critical seeding date was determined for each variety and a comparison was made between the two years. The new winter wheat variety, Gaines, had the highest average yield from all dates of seeding for the winter varieties and Gaines likewise had the highest yield from the latest date of seeding in the spring. There was more variation in the <b>critical</b> <b>heading</b> periods in 1961 - 62 than in 1962 - 63. Redmond showed the greatest variation between the two years. The critical period for yield was earlier than the <b>critical</b> period for <b>heading.</b> The results also showed lack of agreement between the winter hardiness of the winter varieties and the <b>critical</b> <b>heading</b> period...|$|R

500|$|Three {{years after}} the {{destruction}} of the Black Sun portal, the Nazis have deployed advanced technologies, enabling them to turn the tide against the Allies. At dawn on 16 July 1946, U.S. special forces operative Captain William [...] "B.J." [...] Blazkowicz (Brian Bloom), accompanied by pilot Fergus Reid (Gideon Emery) and Private Probst Wyatt III (A.J. Trauth), take part in a massive Allied air raid against a fortress and weapons laboratory run by his nemesis, General Wilhelm [...] "Deathshead" [...] Strasse (Dwight Schultz). The three are captured and brought to a human experimentation laboratory where Deathshead forces Blazkowicz to choose who he will gruesomely kill, Fergus or Wyatt, before leaving Blazkowicz and the survivor to die in the laboratory's emergency incinerator. They escape the laboratory, but Blazkowicz suffers a <b>critical</b> <b>head</b> injury during the escape, rendering him unconscious and putting him in a coma. He is brought to a psychiatric asylum in Poland, where he remains in a vegetative state for 14 years from which he is unable to awake. He is cared for by the asylum's head nurse Anya Oliwa (Alicja Bachleda) and her parents, who run the facility under the Nazi regime. Blazkowicz watches as Anya's parents are regularly forced to hand patients over to Nazi authorities, who deem them Untermenschen for their mental disabilities.|$|E

60|$|That {{seemed at}} the end of ten days the upshot of the abundant, the {{recurrent}} talk through which Strether poured into him all it concerned him to know, put him in full possession of facts and figures. Never cutting these colloquies short by a minute, Chad behaved, looked and spoke as if he were rather heavily, perhaps even a trifle gloomily, but none the less fundamentally and comfortably free. He made no crude profession of eagerness to yield, but he asked the most intelligent questions, probed, at moments, abruptly, even deeper than his friend's layer of information, justified by these touches the native estimate of his latent stuff, and had in every way the air of trying to live, reflectively, into the square bright picture. He walked up and down in front of this production, sociably took Strether's arm at the points at which he stopped, surveyed it repeatedly from the right and from the left, inclined a <b>critical</b> <b>head</b> to either quarter, and, while he puffed a still more critical cigarette, animadverted to his companion on this passage and that. Strether sought relief--there were hours when he required it--in repeating himself; it was in truth not to be blinked that Chad had a way. The main question as yet was of what it was a way TO. It made vulgar questions no more easy; but that was unimportant when all questions save those of his own asking had dropped. That he was free was answer enough, and it wasn't quite ridiculous that this freedom should end by presenting itself as what was difficult to move. His changed state, his lovely home, his beautiful things, his easy talk, his very appetite for Strether, insatiable and, when all was said, flattering--what were such marked matters all but the notes of his freedom? He had the effect of making a sacrifice of it just in these handsome forms to his visitor; which was mainly the reason the visitor was privately, for the time, a little out of countenance. Strether was at this period again and again thrown back on a felt need to remodel somehow his plan. He fairly caught himself shooting rueful glances, shy looks of pursuit, toward the embodied influence, the definite adversary, who had by a stroke of her own failed him and on a fond theory of whose palpable presence he had, under Mrs. Newsome's inspiration, altogether proceeded. He had once or twice, in secret, literally expressed the irritated wish that SHE would come out and find her.|$|E

The analysis {{was based on the}} differential equation describing radial flow to a single root. Assuming transpiration {{to be reduced}} after a <b>critical</b> pressure <b>head</b> (usually chosen as - 1. 5 MPa or - 150 m) at the root surface has been reached, transpiration rates in this so-called falling-rate phase were analyzed numerically for soils described by the van Genuchten-Mualem equations (numerical soils). The analysis was based on the differential equation describing radial flow to a single root. Numerically, the system was simulated by an implicit scheme. It is shown that, at limiting hydraulic conditions, relative transpiration (ratio between actual and potential transpiration) is equal to relative matric flux potential (ratio between actual matric flux potential and matric flux potential at the onset of limiting hydraulic conditions). Given this equality, transpiration reduction functions as a function of soil water content and as a function of time are presented for five types of analytical soils: a constant diffusivity, Green and Ampt, Brooks and Corey, versatile nonlinear, and exponential soil. While in the case of constant diffusivity, relative transpiration decreases as a linear function of water content, for the remaining four cases the decrease is a concave function of soil water content. Numerical simulations also result in a concave shape, unless the difference between water content at the onset of limiting hydraulic conditions and at permanent wilting is very small, for example, at high root densities. These discrepancies may be explained by the relative importance of a transition period between the constant- and falling-rate phases...|$|R
