40|$|The {{reaction}} of [Co 6 C(CO) 15] 2 - with two equivalents of PtCl 2 (Et 2 S) 2 affords the new heterobimetallic carbonyl cluster [Co <b>8</b> <b>Pt</b> 4 C 2 (CO) 24] 2 -. Such a dianion undergoes reversible chemical and electrochemical oxidation and reduction processes disclosing a complete series of [Co <b>8</b> <b>Pt</b> 4 C 2 (CO) 24]n- (n = 1 - 4) clusters. The mono- and dianions have been isolated as their tetra-substituted ammonium salts and fully characterized {{by means of}} IR, 13 C NMR, ESI-MS, and X-ray crystallography. Variable-temperature (VT) solid-state EPR studies on pure crystalline samples indicate that both [Co <b>8</b> <b>Pt</b> 4 C 2 (CO) 24] 2 - and [Co <b>8</b> <b>Pt</b> 4 C 2 (CO) 24]-• are paramagnetic, due to a doublet state of the latter and a triplet state of [Co <b>8</b> <b>Pt</b> 4 C 2 (CO) 24] 2 -. This conclusion is supported by SQUID measurements on the same crystalline sample of [Co <b>8</b> <b>Pt</b> 4 C 2 (CO) 24] 2 -.

40|$|Incorporation of a 5 d {{transition}} metal into the face-centered cubic metal-cyanide cluster geometry is accomplished {{for the first}} time with the isolation of a series of compounds featuring [(Me 3 tacn) <b>8</b> M <b>8</b> <b>Pt</b> 6 (CN) 24] 12 + (M = Cr, Mo) clusters. Reaction of [(Me 3 tacn) Cr(CN) 3] and K 2 [PtCl 4] in a boiling aqueous solution generates [(Me 3 tacn) <b>8</b> Cr <b>8</b> <b>Pt</b> 6 (CN) 24]Cl 12 Æ 27 H 2 O (1), wherein Pt II centers reside at the face-centering sites and the cyanide ligands have reoriented to give PtII– C ” N–CrIII linkages. The cyclic voltammogram obtained for a solution of 1 in DMSO exhibits a quasireversible reduction event centered at E 1 / 2 =) 1. 59 V versus Cp 2 Fe 0 / 1 +. Reaction of 1 with K 2 [Pt(CN) 4] in aqueous solution affords [(Me 3 tacn) <b>8</b> Cr <b>8</b> <b>Pt</b> 6 (CN) 24][Pt(CN) 4] 6 Æ 6 H 2 O (2), in which each face of the cubic cluster is capped by a staggered tetracyanoplatinate anion with a Pt–Pt separation of 3. 1552 (7) Å. Attempts to perform analogous cluster-forming reactions with [(Me 3 tacn) Mo(CN) 3] revealed a tendency toward cluster decomposition to give mixtures of insoluble products, including [(Me 3 tacn) <b>8</b> Mo <b>8</b> <b>Pt</b> 6 (CN) 24][Pt(CN) 4] 6 Æ 46 H 2 O (3) and [(Me 3 tacn) <b>8</b> Mo <b>8</b> <b>Pt</b> 6 (CN) 24][Pt(CN) 4] 2. 5 [Pt(CN) 3 Br] 2 Br 3 Æ 6 H 2 O (4).

40|$|There {{have been}} {{conflicting}} {{evidence for the}} role of adenosine in coronary pressure flow relationship; although adenosine release increases when coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) is reduced, adenosine deaminase does not affect changes in coronary blood flow (CBF). To examine the role of endogenous adenosine in coronary pressure flow relationship, responses of CBF were observed during a stepwise reduction of CPP by 10 mmHg with and without <b>8</b> -phenyltheophylline (<b>8</b> <b>PT).</b> In 32 dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused from the carotid artery, where CBF was measured. According to the reduction of CPP, adenosine concentration detected in coronary venous blood was increased (CPP = 100 mmHg: 7 ± 2, 8 OmmHg: 25 ± 3, 70 mmHg: 53 ± 5, 40 mmHg: 165 ± 11 pmollml), Administration of <b>8</b> <b>PT</b> reduced CBF by 8 ± 3 % at CPP = 100 – 70 mmHg, and by 34 ± 7 % at CPP= 60 - 40 mmHg. When CPP was altered between 100 and 70 mmHg, <b>8</b> <b>PT</b> markedly reduced (p< 0, 001) fractional shortening (FS) and lactate extraction ratio (LER) (FS: 9, 8 ± 1. 2 vs. 23. 6 ± 1. 2 %, LER:- 6, 5 ± 1. 9 vs. 26. 7 ± 1. 9 % at CPP= 70 mmHg). Interestingly, <b>8</b> <b>PT</b> markedly reduced End/Epi flow ratio by 35 ± 4 % at CPP= 70 mmHg. Thus we conclude that when CPP is reduced, endogenous adenosine favors endocardial myocardial flow and preserves myocardial contractile and metabolic function...|$|R

Despite very similar compositions and close peritectics, a protocol for targeted synthesis {{could be developed}} based on differences of the decomposition pressures. Bi <b>8</b> <b>Pt</b> 5 I 3 has a monoclinic crystal structure [space group C 2 /m; a = 1850. 7 (2) pm, b = 391. 46 (3) pm, c = 1340. 5 (1) pm, = 113. 28 (1) degrees], in which corrugated intermetallic layers alternate with monolayers of non-coordinating iodide ions. The platinum atoms are in square, trigonal-prismatic, or capped trigonal-prismatic coordination by bismuth atoms. Additional covalent bonding between platinum atoms defines flat stripes of five atoms width inside the intermetallic layer. Bi 16 Pt 11 I 6 crystallizes in the acentric tetragonal space group P 42 (1) 2 with a = 1386. 6 (1) pm and c = 924. 5 (1) pm. Corresponding to the higher transition-metal content, the covalent network of platinum atoms is two-dimensional. The node connectivity in the network is three or four; the total coordination number of all platinum atoms is ten. Single layers of iodide ions separate the intermetallic layers. Two-thirds of the iodide ions are coordinating bismuth atoms that protrude from the intermetallic layer, forming [BiI 4] squares. Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements on polycrystalline powders indicate that Bi <b>8</b> <b>Pt</b> 5 I 3 and Bi 16 Pt 11 I 6 are diamagnetic metals.

Reversible magnetization curves were plotted as M 1 / 2 versus T. This allows study of the asymptotic behavior of the averaged order parameter amplitude (gap) near the superconducting transition. Results of the analysis show, as expected, a mean field superconducting transition for Li 2 Pd 3 B. By contrast, a large deviation from the mean field behavior is revealed for Li 2 (Pd 0. <b>8</b> <b>Pt</b> 0. 2) 3 B. This is interpreted as due to the strength of the non-s-wave spin-triplet pairing in this Pt-containing compound which produces nodes in the order parameter and, consequently, phase fluctuations. The diamagnetic signal above Tc(H) in Li 2 Pd 3 B is well explained by superconducting Gaussian fluctuations and agrees with the observed mean field transition. For Li 2 (Pd 0. <b>8</b> <b>Pt</b> 0. 2) 3 B the diamagnetic signal above Tc(H) is much higher than the expected Gaussian values and appears to be well explained by three-dimensional critical fluctuations of the lowest-Landau-level type, which somehow agrees with the scenario of a phase mediated transition...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the incidence and etiology of LV dysfunction (LVD) occurring without cellular rejection after cardiac transplantation (CT), we retrospectively reviewed all echocardiograms from 93 consecutive CT recipients at Massachusetts General Hospital. A decrease in LVEF to < 0. 45 {{in the absence}} of secondary causes occurred in 15 patients (pts) (13 M, 2 F). RV biopsies (bx) showed moderate cellular rejection (ISHLT grade 2 to 3 A) in 4 / 15 patients; 3 / 4 pts improved following therapy with enhanced immunosuppression (ENIM). Diagnostic studies in the 11 pts without cellular rejection included LV bx 15 pts) and immunofluorescence staining for vascular rejection (4 pts); all were negative. Coronary angiography was performed in 10 / 11 pts and revealed mild distal disease in 2 pts. These 2 pts died within four months of angiography, and had diffuse coronary artery disease (CAD) at autopsy. Change in LVEF over time in the 9 pts without CAD were:Initial (n= 9) LVD (n= 9) Current (survivors) (n= 6) Months After CT 0. 4 ± 0. 38. 3 ± 7. 847. 8 ± 15 LVEF 0. 64 ± 0. 070. 31 ± 0. 09053 ± 0. 09 LV function improved spontaneously in 1 pI.
