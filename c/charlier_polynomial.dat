40|$|AbstractAn {{upper bound}} on {{permutation}} codes of lengthnis given. This bound is a solution of a certain linear programming problem {{and is based on}} the well-developed theory of association schemes. Several examples are presented. For instance, the 255 values of the bound forn≤ 8 are tabulated. It turns out that, forn≤ 8, the Kiyota bound for group codes also holds for unrestricted codes at least in 178 cases. Also an easier (but weaker) polynomial version of the bound is given. It is obtained by showing that the mappingsFk(θ) (0 ≤k≤n/ 2), whereFkis the <b>Charlier</b> <b>polynomial</b> of degreekand θ the natural character of the symmetric groupSn, are mutually orthogonal characters ofSn...|$|E
40|$|We {{obtain the}} {{time-dependent}} correlation function describing {{the evolution of}} a single spin excitation state in a linear spin chain with isotropic nearest-neighbour XY coupling, where the Hamiltonian is related to the Jacobi matrix of a set of orthogonal polynomials. For the Krawtchouk polynomial case an arbitrary element of the correlation function is expressed in a simple closed form. Its asymptotic limit corresponds to the Jacobi matrix of the <b>Charlier</b> <b>polynomial,</b> and may be understood as a unitary evolution resulting from a Heisenberg group element. Correlation functions for Hamiltonians corresponding to Jacobi matrices for the Hahn, dual Hahn and Racah polynomials are also studied. For the Hahn polynomials we obtain the general correlation function, some of its special cases, and the limit related to the Meixner polynomials, where the su(1, 1) algebra describes the underlying symmetry. For the cases of dual Hahn and Racah polynomials the general expressions of the correlation functions contain summations which are not of hypergeometric type. Simplifications, however, occur in special cases...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} known for over 70 years that there is an {{asymptotic}} transition of Charlier polynomials to Hermite polynomials. This transition, which is still presented in its classical form in modern reference works, is valid if and only if a certain parameter is integer. In this light, it is surprising that a much more powerful transition exists from Charlier polynomials to the Hermite function, valid for any real value of the parameter. This greatly strengthens the asymptotic connections between Charlier polynomials and special functions, with applications for instance in queueing theory. It is shown in this paper that the convergence is uniform in bounded intervals, and a sharp rate bound is proved. It is also shown that there is a transition of derivatives of Charlier polynomials to the derivative of the Hermite function, again with a sharp rate bound. Finally, it is proved that zeros of Charlier polynomials converge to zeros of the Hermite function. While rigorous, the proofs use only elementary techniques.

40|$|We {{investigate}} multiple Charlier {{and multiple}} Meixner polynomials. These are {{extensions of the}} classical <b>Charlier</b> and Meixner <b>polynomials</b> which are orthogonal polynomials {{with respect to the}} Poisson distribution and the Pascal distribution (negative binomial distribution). For multiple C harlier polynomials we impose orthogonality conditions with respect to&n bsp;r different Poisson distributions (with r > 1) and for multiple Meixner polynomials we use r different Pasc al distributions. Depending on the choice of which parameters we select, we then get multiple Meixner polynomials of the first or of the second kind. We give a generating function for multiple <b>Charlier</b> <b>polynomials</b> an d we explicitly compute the recurrence coefficients for the recurrence r elations connecting the nearest neighbor multiple <b>Charlier</b> <b>polynomials.</b> The most important result is the asymptotic behavior of the ratio of two neighboring multiple <b>Charlier</b> <b>polynomials</b> and the asymptotic behavior o f the distribution of the (scaled) zeros, which turn out to be uniformly distributed, independent of the choice of the parameters of the Poisson distributions. We also investigate the case where one of the parameters depends on the scaling and then find a combination of a uniform distrib ution and a new distribution, which in some cases lives on an interval d isjoint of the interval where the scaled zeros are uniformly distributed. We also give a generating function for multiple Meixner polynomials of the first and of the second kind and we compute the coefficients in the nearest neighbor recurrence relations explicitly. Using these formulas, we are able to build on recent results of Miki, Tsujimoto, Vinet and Zh edanov who introduced non-Hermitian oscillator Hamiltonians for which th e eigenstates can be expressed in terms of multiple <b>Charlier</b> <b>polynomials</b> or multiple Meixner polynomials of the first kind.
