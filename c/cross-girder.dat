60|$|A pair of high boots {{appeared}} from above. Then came the leathern breeches, the belt with its dangling tools, the muscular form, and, finally, the fierce, swarthy, eagle {{face of the}} workman. His coat was off and his shirt open, showing the hairy chest. As he appeared there came another sharp snapping vibration from above. The man {{made his way down}} in leisurely fashion, and then, balancing himself upon the <b>cross-girder</b> and leaning against the side piece, he stood with folded arms, looking from under his heavy black brows at the huddled passengers upon the platform.|$|E
50|$|The wing {{center section}} was {{strengthened}} by a typical Blohm & Voss <b>cross-girder,</b> {{which consisted of}} a large-diameter pipe. This transverse tube (divided internally into five sections) also acted as a fuel tank. The center wing was metal-covered, while the outer wings were fabric-covered. There were six hydraulically-operated flaps in the mid-wing. The fuselage was of metal and had an approximately circular cross-section.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} {{consists of}} a steel frame of 12-inch girders achored into the bedrock of the mountain ridge. The four columns in the four corners extend {{up to the second}} level and are made of reinforced concrete. A system of <b>cross-girder</b> braces adds strength to the shaft and cross-beams support the floors. It is also the site of the first home elevator in Connecticut.|$|E
25|$|Bridge 42 employs reused fishbelly plate <b>cross-girders</b> as {{its main}} span members, which is rare.|$|R
25|$|In fact {{locomotive}} weights increased {{considerably in}} the succeeding years. The <b>cross-girders</b> supporting the track were cast iron and by 1890 {{they were considered}} to require strengthening, which was done with steel box girders.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{comprises}} two 60 {{foot plate}} girder spans with timber longitudinals and timber approach spans including 36 foot spans strengthened with strut and crown, other spans by truss and tie rods. Metal girders are continuous over two spans and support <b>cross-girders</b> at lower flange level. These carry longitudinal timber stringers {{on which the}} rails rest.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Maslenica Bridge {{was designed}} by Vojislav Draganić of Inženjerski Projektni Zavod (IPZ) between 1955 and 1960. By 1989, wear caused by heavy traffic and inadequate maintenance became significant, including cracks on the cross-girders and a pier. That led to a half-year-long suspension of freight traffic across the bridge while it was repaired. The issues with the spandrel structure and the piers were remediated at that time by strengthening the pier and column cross-sections and by repairs to the <b>cross-girder</b> joints. During the summer of 1990, the bridge was once again in full operation, followed by another period of restricted use while the rehabilitation works were completed.|$|E
50|$|Samuel Stephens, railway labourer, Liskeard, said he {{had been}} {{employed}} on Coldrenick-viaduct since the summer. The scaffolding which fell had been erected some weeks. At the time of the accident there were 13 men actually bearing on the platform which collapsed. There were about 17 men taking part in the work of removing the girder. As the girder was pushed forward more men came to the front bearing on the span which collapsed. When the men in front had the girder on their shoulders the weight on the platform would be increased. He and 12 other men were carrying the girder on their shoulders, one end being supported by the pier of the viaduct. Just as {{the other end of the}} girder was approaching a <b>cross-girder</b> on which it was intended to rest it the staging suddenly collapsed and 12 of the gang fell into the valley beneath.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge is}} 315.3 m long, {{measured}} between the abutments, comprising a steel arch supporting a reinforced concrete deck executed {{as a continuous}} girder across 17 spans: 17.52 m + 2 x 19.71 m + 19.68 m + 7 x 17.52 m + 19.68 m + 4 x 19.71 m + 17.52 m. The deck structure comprises a grillage consisting of the deck slab with longitudinal girders and <b>cross-girders.</b> The 0.25 m thick reinforced concrete deck slab {{is supported by the}} <b>cross-girders</b> set 2.19 m apart and the longitudinal girders set 8 m apart and made composite. The bridge piers and spandrel columns comprise hollow square cross-section. Size of the squares (edge) varies depending on height of the piers and columns from 650 mm to 850 mm, except for the columns at the springing which are 2300 mm wide. The arch spans 155 m, with an arch rise of 41.45 m. The arch comprises a box cross section and provides a 55 m clearance below the bridge.|$|R
50|$|Bridge piers {{comprise}} a box cross-section measuring 5.0 m by 3.2 m with a constant wall thickness of 30 cm. The {{top of each}} of the piers is closed by an Omnia slab 15 cm deep. Each motorway carriageway is supported by a separate set of piers. The abutments, on the other hand, are designed to support both of the carriageways. The <b>cross-girders</b> are placed at the abutments and the piers.|$|R
50|$|It {{has four}} main steel girder spans, {{supported}} by three sandstone piers. As well as the four steel spans, there is a stone arch {{at each end of}} the viaduct. The steel spans are 33.4 m long, and are at a skew of 70° The spans consist of twin truss girders sitting on the piers, and on top of the truss <b>cross-girders</b> supporting steel deck plates, with a ballasted track.|$|R
50|$|The double {{railroad}} {{is carried}} by four longitudinal steel trough girders, with {{the sides of}} the troughs acting as guards against derailment. These are supported by massive <b>cross-girders</b> riveted to the underneath of the vertical struts and lower booms of the main trusses, at 5.2 metre intervals. The decking consists of ironbark longitudinals bedded on bitumen and sand, and bolted to steel tee bars which connect the trough girders transversely.|$|R
2500|$|... 401 new <b>cross-girders</b> were {{fitted in}} 1905 to allow heavier {{locomotives}} to pass over. In 1908 the two spans nearest Saltash station were replaced with wider ones {{to accommodate a}} new track layout. The remaining approach spans were replaced {{on both sides of}} the river during 1928 and 1929. During the 1930s new cross-bracing and diagonal sway-bracing were added between the vertical standards to further strengthen the bridge and keep the suspension chains hanging in the correct shape.|$|R
50|$|A {{variant of}} baulk road {{can still be}} seen today on some older under-line bridges where no ballast is provided. The design varies considerably, {{but in many cases}} {{longitudinal}} timbers are supported directly on the <b>cross-girders,</b> with transoms and tiebars to retain the gauge, and modern rails and base-plates or chairs laid on top. It can also be found in places where easy drainage is required or where access is required under rail vehicles for maintenance.|$|R

50|$|The two trusses are {{asymmetrical}} {{and different}} sizes as {{the bridge is}} constructed on the skew due to the angle that the two lines make to each other. The larger truss is 185 ft long and weighs 88 LT; the smaller truss is 161 ft and weighs 70 LT. Vertical suspenders are attached to alternate <b>cross-girders,</b> which are spaced at 11.75 ft centres. These support two longitudinal bearers beneath the rails, above which is a steel deck. The whole steelwork weighs 227 LT.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bridge is}} also {{considerably}} damaged by human spitting. A technical inspection by Port Trust officials in 2011 revealed that spitting had reduced {{the thickness of}} the steel hoods protecting the pillars from six to less than three millimeters since 2007. The hangers need those hoods at the base to prevent water seeping into the junction of the <b>cross-girders</b> and hangers, and damage to the hoods can jeopardize the safety of the bridge. KoPT announced that it will spend [...] on covering the base of the steel pillars with fibreglass casing to prevent spit from corroding them.|$|R
500|$|St George's Bridge {{is one of}} {{the newest}} bridges over the Don. It carries the dual {{carriageway}} New Bridge Road, part of the A19, which is now the main road north out of Doncaster. [...] It was opened on 22 November 2001, and was named St George's Bridge {{as a result of a}} public competition. [...] It consists of a [...] long steel-composite bridge with spans of [...] over the River Don, the East Coast Main Line, and the Don Navigation. The ladder beam layout, using two main plate girders, <b>cross-girders</b> at [...] centres and precast planks, was [...] chosen both to optimise the deck and to minimise the size and number of the piers.|$|R
50|$|On 24 June 2005, {{a private}} cargo vessel M V Mani, {{belonging}} to the Ganges Water Transport Pvt. Ltd, while trying to pass under the bridge during high tide, had its funnel stuck underneath for three hours, causing substantial damage worth about 15 million to the stringer and longitudinal girder of the bridge. Some of the 40 <b>cross-girders</b> were also broken. Two of four trolley guides, bolted and welded with the girders, were extensively damaged. Nearly 350 m of 700 m of the track were twisted beyond repair. The damage was so severe that KoPT requested help from Rendall-Palmer & Tritton Limited, the original consultant on the bridge from UK. KoPT also contacted SAIL to provide 'matching steel' used during its construction in 1943, for the repairs. For the repair costing around , about 8 tonnes of steel was used. The repairs were completed in early 2006.|$|R
50|$|The deck {{structure}} consists of longitudinal girders, <b>cross-girders,</b> and the deck. The abutments and the outermost piers support the structure through bearings while {{the remaining four}} piers are fixed to the {{deck structure}}. The longitudinal girders are executed as prefabricated, pretensioned girders and there are 10 longitudinal girders comprising the cross-section of the bridge, i.e. five of them, with axes set 2.7 m apart, supporting each of the carriageways. Length of the prefabricated girders ranges from 38.6 m to 39 m in the peripheral spans and between 48.24 m and 48.66 m in the remaining spans. The girders are 240 cm high I-sections with 268 cm wide upper flange. The bottom flange of the longitudinal girders is 68 cm wide. The longitudinal girders were manufactured in a special plant next to the bridge construction site {{and placed in the}} bridge structure using incremental launching.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the pier {{foundations}} was further affected {{by the fact that}} the valley is a high quality agricultural area that had to be preserved as much as possible. The height of the reinforced concrete piers ranges from 13.45 m to 40.03 m and each of the piers is topped by a cap beam. The piers comprise an I-cross section with the webs aligned with the bridge axis. Peripheral piers (P1, P2, P20, P21) are executed on shallow foundations, while the remaining piers are executed on driven piles. The superstructure consists of two longitudinal prefabricated girders of constant depth set 550 cm apart made composite with the deck slab and <b>cross-girders.</b> Structurally, the superstructure is a 1354.86 m long continuous girder across 22 spans, tracing a horizontal and a vertical curve. The cross section of the superstructure consists of two solid I-section steel girders of constant depth.|$|R
5000|$|An {{accident}} {{occurred on}} 9 February 1897 during the reconstruction while {{a gang of}} 17 workmen were working below the viaduct superstructure on a platform that collapsed, throwing 12 of the men 140 ft to their deaths. They were working in the seventh span; <b>cross-girders</b> had been installed and they were positioning a longitudinal wrought iron rail-bearer, moving it by hand with one end supported on the viaduct pier. The rail-bearer was 20 feet long. The [...] "platform" [...] they were working on, spanning that gap, {{was supported by a}} second-hand timber beam formerly used as a main structural member in one of the other spans; it had several notches cut out (for its former use) and there was decay at the slenderest point. The supervising engineer said a chain should have been used to support the centre, to take part of the load of the men and the rail-bearer.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} using the probabilistic neural network (PNN) to identify the damage type and region in the cable-stayed Ting Kau Bridge from the simulated noisy modal data. The essence of the PNN for damage type and region identification is to judge the pattern class of damage types and regions to which the test vectors of unknown source should belong. In the present study, a total of 17 pattern classes are defined for the Ting Kau Bridge to depict various damage types and different damage locations. The simulated damage cases involve the damage occurring at the main stay cables, longitudinal stabilizing cables, transverse stabilizing cables, main girders, <b>cross-girders,</b> and bearings. The characteristic ensembles for each pattern class (training samples) are obtained by computing the natural frequency change ratios when incurring the corresponding damage in a validated finite element model of the bridge and then corrupting the analytical frequencies with random noise. The testing samples for damage localization exercises are obtained {{in a similar way}} except that the damage is incurred at a different location of the same region for each pattern class. The simulation study results show that when the first twenty natural frequencies are used, the damage type and region can be identified with a high confidence even if the measured natural frequencies are polluted by the random noise with 10 % standard deviation...|$|R

Structure and Infrastructure Engineering Volume 7, Issue 11, November 2011, Pages 823 - 841 Dynamical {{identification}} and modelling of steel-concrete composite high-speed railway bridges (Article) Chellini, G., Nardini, L., Salvatore, W. Department of Civil Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy View references (14) Abstract In the last few years, {{the construction of new}} high-speed (HS) railways across Europe, as well as in many other countries, has required many different bridges and viaducts. Together with classical concrete solutions, new steel- concrete composite typologies have been developed, giving light and cheap structures. Despite these studies and applications, some concerns still remain about the definition of reliable models for the evaluation of their actual dynamical behaviour under HS train passage. In particular, the influence of many structural and non-structural components, such as <b>cross-girders</b> and ballast, are still not well recognised. In this paper, open problems related to the dynamical assessment and modelling of new steel-concrete four-parallel-girder and box-girder solutions are exposed and analysed. A suitable procedure, based on operational modal analysis, model updating and train-bridge interaction analysis is applied to two bridges, recently built in the new Italian HS network, in order to assess and verify their dynamic behaviour under operative conditions...|$|R
50|$|Brunel {{also looked}} at novel track forms, and decided to use a {{continuously}} supported rail. Using longitudinal timbers under each rail, he achieved a smoother profile while not requiring such a strong rail section, and he used a shallow bridge rail for the purpose. The wider, flat foot also meant that the chair needed by the bullhead section could be dispensed with. The longitudinal timbers needed to be kept at the proper spacing to retain the gauge correctly, and Brunel achieved this by using timber transoms - transverse spacers - and iron tie-bars. The whole assembly {{was referred to as}} the baulk road - railwaymen usually call their track a road. Initially, Brunel had the track tied down to timber piles to prevent lateral movement and bounce, but he had overlooked the fact that the made ground, on which his track was supported between piles, would settle. The piles remained stable and the ground between them settled so that his track soon had an unpleasant undulation, and he had to have the piles severed, so that the track could settle more or less uniformly. A variant of the baulk road can still be seen today on many older under-bridges where no ballast was provided. The design varies considerably, but in many cases longitudinal timbers are supported directly on the <b>cross-girders,</b> with transoms and tiebars to retain the gauge, but of course with modern rails and base-plates or chairs. The longitudinal sleepers are somewhat similar to modern-day Ladder track.|$|R
5000|$|On the Crumlin and Belah Viaducts, however, {{horizontal}} bracing {{was provided by}} substantial fitted cast-iron girders securely attached to the columns, with the diagonal braces then being attached to the girders. [...] The Chairman of the Court of Inquiry quoted at length from a contemporary book praising the detailed engineering of the Belah viaduct piers (and describing the viaduct {{as one of the}} lightest and cheapest of the kind that had ever been erected)....It is a distinguishing feature in this viaduct that the cross, or distance girders of the piers encircle the columns, which are turned up at that point, the girders being bored out to fit the turned part with great accuracy. No cement of any kind was used in the whole structure, and the piers when completed, and the vertical and horizontal wrough-iron bracings keyed up, are nearly as rigid as though they were one solid piece...... The fitting was all done by machines, which were specially designed for the purpose, and finished the work with mathematical accuracy The flanges of the column were all faced up and their edges turned, and every column was stepped into the one below it with a lip of about 5/8 of an inch in depth, the lip and socket for it being actually turned and bored. That portion of the column against which the cross girders rested was also turned. The whole of these operations were performed at one time, the column being centred in a hollow mandril-lathe. After being turned the columns passed on to a drilling machine, in which all the holes in each flange were drilled out of the solid simultaneously. And as this was done with them all in the same machine, the holes of course, perfectly coincided when the columns were placed one on the other in the progress of erection. Similar care was taken with the <b>cross-girders,</b> which were bored out at the ends by machines designed for that purpose. Thus, when the pieces of the viaduct had to be put together at the place of erection there was literally not a tool required, and neither chipping or filing to retard the progress of the work.Either, said the Chairman, the Belah viaduct had been over-engineered, or the Tay Bridge had been under engineered.|$|R
