One very fundamental design concept of H.264 is to generate self-contained packets, to remove the header duplication as in MPEG-4's Header Extension Code (HEC). This was achieved by decoupling information relevant to more than one slice from the media stream. The combination of the higher-level parameters is called a parameter set. The H.264 specification includes two types of parameter sets: Sequence Parameter Set (SPS) and Picture Parameter Set (PPS). An active sequence parameter set remains unchanged throughout a coded video sequence, and an active picture parameter set remains unchanged within a <b>coded</b> <b>picture.</b> The sequence and picture parameter set structures contain information such as picture size, optional coding modes employed, and macroblock to slice group map.|$|E

Each coded {{video sequence}} can be decoded independently of any other coded video sequence, given the necessary parameter set information, which may be conveyed [...] "in-band" [...] or [...] "out-of-band". At the beginning of a coded video sequence is an instantaneous decoding refresh (IDR) access unit. An IDR access unit contains an intra picture which is a <b>coded</b> <b>picture</b> that can be decoded without decoding any previous pictures in the NAL unit stream, and the presence of an IDR access unit indicates that no subsequent picture in the stream will require reference to pictures prior to the intra picture it contains in order to be decoded.A NAL unit stream may contain one or more coded video sequence.|$|E

For the calculation of amount of blockiness, all the block boundaries which have BS equal to 4 for intra coded frames and BS equal to 2 for the inter coded frames are counted.

Theories of formation of Fourier images are discussed. A confusion is shown to exist between Fourier images derived from related objects.

In combined scalability of SVC, a <b>coded</b> <b>picture</b> of a base or scalable enhancement layer is produced as one or more video layers consisting of network abstraction layer (NAL) units. The SVC NAL unit header contains a (DID, TID, QID) field to identify the association of each SVC NAL unit with its scalable enhancement layer without parsing the payload part of the SVC NAL unit. In this paper, we utilize the (DID, TID, QID) information to derive hierarchical spatio-temporal relationship of the SVC NAL units. Based on the derivation using the (DID, TID, QID) field, we propose a practical RTP packetization scheme for generating single RTP sessions in unicast and multicast transport of SVC video.

It targets {{applications such as}} classroom lectures and video conferencing. The proposed method {{is based on the}} FlyCam panoramic video system that is designed to produce high resolution and wide-angle video sequences by stitching the video pictures from multiple stationary cameras. The panoramic video sequence is compressed into an MPEG- 2 stream for delivery. The proposed method integrates region of interest (ROI) detection, tracking, and virtual camera control, and works on compressed domain information only. It first detects the ROI in the P (predictive <b>coded)</b> <b>picture</b> using only the macroblock type information. It then up-samples this detection result to obtain the ROI of the whole video stream. The ROI is tracked using a Kalman filter. The Kalman filter estimation results are used for virtual camera control that simulates human controlled video recording.
