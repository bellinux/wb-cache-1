5000|$|On {{bicycles}} that do {{not have}} a derailleur or other <b>chain</b> <b>tensioning</b> device, rear horizontal dropouts allow adjustment of chain tension, and can accommodate a range of chain lengths or cog sizes. They were standard on most older derailleur bicycles from before the 1990s. An older derailleur-equipped bicycle with horizontal dropouts can be readily converted into singlespeed, fixed gear or to use an internally geared hub.|$|E
50|$|Rear {{vertical}} dropouts {{have the}} slot facing downwards. The {{advantage is that}} the wheel axle cannot slip forward compared with horizontal dropouts. The disadvantage is that on a bicycle without a rear derailleur but with vertical dropouts, the chain tension cannot be adjusted by moving the wheel forwards or backwards, and needs another means of chain-tensioning, by a derailleur, chain tensioner, or eccentric bottom bracket or rear hub. Fixed wheel bicycles cannot use any form of <b>chain</b> <b>tensioning</b> device, because the lower run of chain is pulled very tight when using the transmission as a brake.|$|E
5000|$|For the '87+ model, the {{swingarm}} {{design was}} changed to a more [...] "beefy" [...] design after cracking / breaking issues with the 85-86 swingarm design. Clearly, the Suzuki engineers underestimated how hard their customers could ride their product. However, the '87+ swingarm will mount to the 85-86 frame with some other minor equipment swap (i.e. rear shock, link). The '87+ rear axle carrier includes forward-reverse slide <b>chain</b> <b>tensioning</b> rather than the 85-86's rotary tensioning method. The '87+ carrier housing slides forward and reverse and then is {{held in place by}} four vertical bolts and two rear horizontal bolts whereas the 85-86 carrier was held with a clamp or pinch design.|$|E

40|$|A load to an {{armoured}} {{face conveyor}} (AFC) during coal mining is changeable and very difficult or even {{impossible to be}} predicted. Changes of the load to the upper scraper chain affect the load of the driving motor and generate changes in a scraper <b>chain</b> <b>tension.</b> Impact of increasing the external load to the upper scraper chain on the operation of electric motors and on the scraper <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> is presented. The developed numerical model of the Rybnik 850 conveyor enabled identifying the places of the scraper <b>chain</b> high <b>tension</b> or places of its loosening. An impact of changing frequency of driving motor voltage on AFC’s operational conditions was tested and analysed using the AFC’s numerical model. During tests, tension of the scraper chain on the discharge end and the return end was recorded. High tension of the scraper chain and its loosening during the changeable load were also recorded on upward and downward transportation of run-of-mine material...|$|R
50|$|The {{speedometer}} drive mechanism operated {{from the rear}} wheel, with a long cable to the speedometer. This drive mechanism wore out very quickly, as did any replacement, leading to no speedometer reading (never resolved). The early tachometer drive jutted from {{the right side of}} the engine, and was vulnerable to being struck and snapped off (relocated to front of engine). The primary <b>chain</b> <b>tensioning</b> bolt tended to loosen at inconvenient times. The rear chain adjusting bolts pushed, rather than pulled, the rear axle, and would bend, making them difficult to turn. Nor were there index marks to allow equal axle positioning on the right and left side of the swing arm. The ignition switch mount would break from vibration (later relocated).|$|E

50|$|For {{motorcycles}} with chain drives, {{the rear}} axle {{can usually be}} adjusted forward and back {{in relation to the}} swingarm, to adjust <b>chain</b> <b>tension,</b> but a few models (such as 1971/72 Triumph and BSA four-strokes) make the adjustment at the swingarm's pivot point.|$|R
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} pivot (like the Hesketh V1000) was co-axial with the drive sprocket to maintain constant <b>chain</b> <b>tension.</b> This feature meant that (i) a smaller drive chain {{could be used}} and/or (ii) the chain was less stressed and therefore less likely to break.|$|R

40|$|The design {{requirements}} for the new electric powertrain were the ability to deliver the peak power of 80 kw allowed by rules and meet the mass goal of 23 kg. Rear wheel independence needed to be maintained either through a multi-motor design or a differential, but with vehicle performance in mind. Stiffness of the mounting system was another goal, as the previous design had lateral deflections larger than deemed acceptable. Along with system {{design requirements}}, various components and packaging options were considered. Preliminary design and estimation coupled with fundamental engineering rational focused the design to a particular setup. In parallel with system design, analysis was performed to select materials, geometry, bearings, and hardware. Load cases were analyzed to determine how FEA simulations would be set up. Failure modes checked were primarily yield conditions, but stiffness of the mounting plates was also analyzed to ensure the system met the max deflection goal of 0. 005 ". The final design included a single three phase electric motor capable of up to 100 kW peak with a limited slip differential, and a mass reduction of almost 45 % over the previous powertrain, meeting the mass goal. Eccentric rings allow for easy <b>chain</b> <b>tensioning.</b> A simple 6 bolt mounting system makes the self-contained unit easy to remove from the frame, and overall stiffness is improved from the previous design. by Brian Wanek.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to design the 2016 {{combustion}} car drivetrain for Global Formula Racing (GFR). The goal of this project was to improve upon the 2015 drivetrain design by reducing complexity, weight, and maintenance time. To reduce complexity the spool was changed to a one piece system and the drivetrain inserts were changed to a simpler design. These changes were able to reduce weight and the complexity of machining by making the designs more simple. The drivetrain mounting system had its complexity reduced by moving to a eccentric <b>chain</b> <b>tensioning</b> design. This was chosen because it reduced the time to adjust the chain and reduced the overall part count of the system. The major issues that occurred during this project {{had to do with}} the manufacturing of the drivetrain mounts. Since there were issues finding sponsors to make the mounts they had to be made in house. This required learning edgecam and the cnc machining process to be able to manufacture them. The machining of the mounts took a tremendous amount of time and this made it difficult for their to be enough time during the manufacturing phase to make two complete sets. The result of this project is a finished and functioning drivetrain for the 2016 combustion car. The car has been through numerous test days and the drivetrain has worked exactly as expected. So far there have been no issues with the performance or maintenance of the system. Next year the designer of the drivetrain should focus on further improvement of the spool design and reducing the manufacturing time of the whole system. Furthermore, a heavy emphasis should be put on finding sponsors with large machining capabilities to help manufacture the drivetrain system...|$|E
50|$|The belt or <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> on a single-speed bicycle can be {{maintained}} by either setting the fixed horizontal position of the rear sprocket or the front chainring horizontally, or by a separate tensioner that pushes perpendicular to the chain with either a fixed position or spring tension.|$|R

25|$|Track frames {{have much}} in common with road and time trial frames, but come with rear-facing, {{horizontal}} fork ends, rather than dropouts, to allow one to adjust the position of the rear wheel horizontally to set the proper <b>chain</b> <b>tension.</b> Also the seat tube angle is steeper than on road racing bikes.|$|R

25|$|Prior to 1937 {{this was}} the only {{permitted}} form of gear changing on the Tour de France.

50|$|Eccentrics {{are used}} in {{applications}} that require precise <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> adjustment such as the timing chain of tandem bicycles, the chain that connects the stoker's and captain's cranks. They may also be employed on bicycles {{that do not have}} an adjustable rear wheel position, due to vertical dropouts or a rear disc brake, and that do not have an external rear derailleur such as single-speeds or bikes with an internal-geared hub.|$|R
5000|$|One method, used by Shimano, {{is to use}} <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> {{to pivot}} the cage. This has the {{advantage}} of working with most sets of sprockets, if the chain has the proper length. A disadvantage is that rapid shifts from small sprockets to large over multiple sprockets at once can cause the cage to strike the sprockets before the chain moves onto the larger sprockets and pivots the cage as necessary.|$|R
50|$|Single-speed bicycle {{builders}} {{have devised}} {{a variety of}} methods for producing and maintaining the proper <b>chain</b> <b>tension.</b> The most common method is horizontal rear dropouts or track ends. These allow the rear wheel to be moved fore or aft as necessary. Using chain tugs with track ends ensures that optimum <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> can be achieved with the wheel remaining centered. A similar design, sliding dropouts, uses detachable dropouts that are bolted to the frame through horizontal slots. This allows both quick release or bolt on hubs to be used, or through-axle hubs with the appropriate dropouts. Sliding dropouts usually have set screws that bear on the front of them through the frame to adjust their position for tensioning and wheel alignment. The main advantage of sliding dropouts over track ends is realized when they are used with disc brakes, as the brake caliper mount is part of the left dropout, and thus moves with the dropout, maintaining the hub to caliper distance. Sliding dropouts can also include a derailleur hanger if multi-speed use is desired.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{derailleur}} serves double duty: moving the chain between rear sprockets and taking up chain slack caused by {{moving to a}} smaller sprocket at the rear or a smaller chainring by the front derailleur. In order to accomplish this second task, it is positioned {{in the path of}} the bottom, slack portion of chain. Sometimes the rear-derailleurs are re-purposed as chain tensioners for single-speed bicycles that cannot adjust <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> by a different method.|$|R
50|$|The Swift {{frame is}} simple and robust, and allows a quick fold, but when folded is not as compact as some other folding bicycle designs. The bottom bracket forms part of the folding rear triangle, {{and as a result}} the bottom bracket to rear fork-end {{distance}} remains constant throughout the fold. This keeps the <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> constant, which is an advantage when the Swift frame is used in a fixed-gear, single speed, or hub gear bicycle.|$|R
