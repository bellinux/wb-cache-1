500|$|Lavigne's {{feature film}} debut was voicing an {{animated}} {{character in the}} 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, [...] "All the actors went in individually, and [...] Tim and [...] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel <b>comfortable....</b> <b>That</b> was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with {{no one else to}} kind of feed off of." [...] Lavigne found the recording process to be [...] "easy" [...] and [...] "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. [...] "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." [...] Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. [...] " [...] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|The {{changes that}} were {{eventually}} tabled included the enshrining {{of sexual orientation}} as protected grounds but not {{the removal of the}} section dealing with [...] "exposing to contempt." [...] This omission was criticized, Levant said that it made him [...] "deeply embarrassed as a conservative," [...] but Stelmach said that his caucus was <b>comfortable</b> <b>that</b> another provision, requiring that the impugned section should not [...] "be deemed to interfere with the free expression of opinion on any subject", protected Albertans against its abusive use. The proposal also included a section entitling parents to advance notice from schools if their children were going to be taught [...] "subject-matter that deals explicitly with religion, sexuality or sexual orientation" [...] and the right to remove their children from such classes. Stelmach called this a [...] "very, very fundamental right" [...] and suggested that it would allow parents to opt out of having their children learn about evolution, though his Education Minister Dave Hancock argued that the new wording didn't extend beyond current practice. Alberta Teachers' Association President Frank Bruseker expressed concern that this would make the teaching of science and geography in public schools very difficult, and suggested that parents who did not wish to have their children exposed to evolution should home school them or send them to private school. New Democratic Party leader Brian Mason suggested that the changes would make Alberta [...] "sound like Arkansas".|$|E
500|$|Mutchnick, {{in regards}} of Debra Messing's character, said: [...] "Grace doesn't fall {{into any of}} those {{categories}} that have stereotyped Jewish women. She's strong, she's pretty and she's a proud Jewish woman." [...] Mutchnick revealed that Nicollette Sheridan was originally brought in to read the part of Grace, but even though she did a [...] "great job", her performance was [...] "too desperate". Mutchnick and Kohan decided to cast Messing in the role instead, {{who at the time}} was starring in ABC's drama Prey. After her first meeting with them, Messing was not convinced she wanted the role. Messing revealed that Mutchnick and Kohan showed up at her home with a bottle of vodka; [...] "They poured me several shots, we spoke for several hours and they pitched me the show. I'm a lightweight. I didn't need much to be a little giddy. By the end of the evening, they said, 'Will you do it?' I said, 'Let's talk tomorrow.'" [...] They called her the next day to inform her that they [...] "loved her" [...] and asked [...] "if she'd made up her mind". Messing still did not make her mind up. However, the following day, she called Mutchnick and Kohan and accepted the role. In discussion of the character, Messing said: [...] "I have a lot more confidence and I'm much more relaxed. I feel <b>comfortable</b> <b>that</b> Grace will be a character I'll enjoy doing for a long time." [...] She later, however, admitted that director Burrows was the reason for doing Will & Grace. Messing was the last actor to be cast.|$|E

2500|$|In {{light of}} some {{criticism}} about the insistent tone of these words, {{on one occasion}} he explained [...] "This {{has always been the}} hope and yearning of the Jewish people – that the Messiah should come now, immediately. Therefore it is inappropriate for someone to say that he does not want, or that he does not agree, or that he is not <b>comfortable</b> <b>that</b> people are imploring 'we want moshiach now.' Each Jew clearly prays and pleads three times a day in the amida, while standing before the Al-mighty (at that time a person is certainly speaking the truth, and saying what he means) et tzemach davud avdecha me’hera tatzmiach , and then continues ki lishuatcha kivinu kol hayom, that he hopes for this the entire day!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 10, 2007, the Nevada State Athletic Commission {{announced}} that Diaz failed the drug test {{that was taken}} shortly before his win over Gomi, testing positive for marijuana. The NSAC declared the fight a [...] "No Contest" [...] and suspended him for 6 months with a fine of 20% of his earnings ($3,000) won from the fight against Gomi. The Commission felt that the result of Diaz's THC test, an enormous 175, was a contributing factor in his performance during the fight. Commission Chairman Dr. Tony Alamo said that while a result of 15 is considered positive, the NSAC has a threshold of 50 for athletes. He also believes they [...] "feel very <b>comfortable</b> <b>that</b> everyone that tests positive in Nevada is truly positive." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{pre-production}} memos, Whedon {{described his}} vision for the score as [...] "spare, intimate, mournful and indefatigable". Just as the landscape and speech drew from elements of the Western, he wished the same of the musical style and instrumentation. However, {{he did not want}} to step too far into Western clichés to [...] "cause justified derision" [...] and hoped the score would also draw from Chinese and other Asian musical elements. He wanted the musical elements [...] "mixed up, hidden, or it's as much a cliché as the western feel. We don't want to be too specific about culture or time. We want to be comfortable enough with the sounds not to let them take us out of the story, but not so <b>comfortable</b> <b>that</b> we begin to be told where the story is." [...] Music was to draw heavily on what could be carried, and he highlighted four instruments: voice, percussion, woodwind, strings particularly guitar. He cautioned against vocal orchestration, believing there to be only two voices in Hollywood and wishing to avoid both, and advised moderation in woodwind, feeling wind instruments to be [...] "either too airy or too sophisticated".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by former team owner Eddie Jordan, Hamilton said at his final pit stop, {{he did not}} feel any pressure because he felt comfortable after being aware of his healthy lead. Vettel revealed his team altered their strategy before the safety car appeared on track and stated the final laps with worn tyres were [...] "very, very much borderline" [...] and emphasised the challenge of the track in hot and humid weather conditions. Ricciardo spoke of the event feeling like a [...] "home race" [...] and said he would watch Alonso's first lap to see whether he should have ceded another position to Ricciardo. In the later press conference, Hamilton felt the race would have been [...] "hardcore" [...] had Rosberg not retired and knew Mercedes would not be [...] "100 percent happy" [...] as they aspired to secure victories collectively and be the sport's most dominant team. Vettel revealed {{he did not feel}} <b>comfortable</b> <b>that</b> he could reach the end of the race on worn tyres but stated second was the best possible result for Red Bull. Ricciardo was satisfied to put his teammate Vettel under pressure but felt it was a processional event for the top three finishers.|$|E
