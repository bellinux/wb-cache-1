40|$|Longwall shearers usually {{suffer from}} {{excessive}} pick and pickholder consumptions and severe wear of the backplate of the <b>clearance</b> <b>ring</b> section of shearer drums. In practice, {{most of the}} drums were seen to be withdrawn from the face due to the abovementioned problems, while vane picks and their holders were intact due to the improper lacing design of the <b>clearance</b> <b>ring</b> picks. However, few underground investigations and their results {{on the effect of}} lacing arrangement of clearance picks on the service life of shearer drums have been published. Nevertheless, the pick consumption characteristics of shearer drums were not investigated in detail, since these are fewer pick consumptions with shearers when compared to roadheaders. This paper is concerned with the comprehensive in situ trials on the effect of lacing of <b>clearance</b> <b>ring</b> picks on the lifespan of shearer drums, and the pick consumption characteristics of longwall shearers at Cayirhan Coal Mine in Turkey. The lifespan of shearer drums employed with shearers in this mine increased 70 per cent, while the consumption rate of <b>clearance</b> <b>ring</b> picks decreased three fold through using an alternative lacing for clearance picks, indicating the significance of utilizing proper design techniques for <b>clearance</b> <b>ring</b> picks for the service life of shearer drums. Statistical analyses carried out, using the raw pick consumption data, implied that the <b>clearance</b> <b>ring</b> picks experienced much higher loads than vane picks, revealing that special attention must be paid to designing <b>clearance</b> <b>ring</b> picks. An average maximum consumption value of 41 was determined for <b>clearance</b> <b>ring</b> picks, with corner-cutting picks having the most replacements, while it was 35 for vane picks, on three-day based pick replacements...|$|E

The result shows that the flow field in front of inlet of runner is unstable extremely, even if a tiny disturbance effects on, which will be out-of-balance symmetrically in the radial direction, then the force of runner will be unbalance, which will cause vibration of the hydraulic turbine.

40|$|The leakage flow {{paths in}} the {{sidewall}} gaps of centrifugal pumps are of significant importance for numbers of effects. The paper {{is concerned with}} the transient flow in the leakage flow paths with wear <b>ring</b> <b>clearance</b> variation. For this purpose, numerical simulations of the whole pump were carried out. The grid dependence and yplus check were performed first. Additionally, experimental data of performance characteristic and pressure fluctuation inside the sidewall gap was used to validate the numerical results. The transient velocity fields inside the sidewall gaps during one blade passage period were simulated. And the leakage through the wear ring gap was obtained for all operating points investigated. To have a better idea of attenuation and propagation of pressure inside the sidewall gap, the unsteady pressure distributions in the gap were calculated. Additionally, the surfaces of the impeller were divided into four parts. The fluid force on each part was expressed {{as a percentage of the}} total radial force. Through comparing the flow fields, the pressure distributions, and the radial force between the pumps with different wear <b>ring</b> <b>clearances,</b> the effects of the wear <b>ring</b> <b>clearance</b> were discussed in detail. The results can be used to guide the optimum design of the pump sidewall gaps...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is presented to}} calculate damping in ring seals for a compressible fluid. Results show that damping in tapered ring seals (optimized for stiffness) is less than that in straight bore ring seals for the same minimum <b>clearance.</b> Damping in <b>ring</b> seals can promote fractional frequency whirl and can, thus, be detrimental. Thus, tapered seals can benefit rotor and seal stability by having lower damping as well as higher stiffness. Use of incompressible results leads to large errors...|$|R
40|$|Since overlarge {{axial force}} {{can damage the}} pump, {{accurate}} calculation formula of axial force on pump is very significant. The traditional formula {{is based on the}} assumption that the leakage amount of the pump is zero and the angular speed of fluid in the pump chamber rotates at half the impeller rotation’s angular speed. In order to propose an accurate calculation formula, the whole flow fields of multistage pumps with three different <b>ring</b> <b>clearances</b> were calculated by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The results indicate that the axial force on first-stage impeller is larger than that on the second. Along with the change of <b>ring</b> <b>clearance,</b> the static pressure distribution on the shroud of impeller changes at the same time, which leads to the value change of axial force. Meanwhile, angular speed of the fluid in the pump chamber is changing. Therefore, this research works out the reason why the error of traditional axial force calculation is large when the amount of leakage is relatively high. At last, an accurate calculation formula of axial force on pump is obtained through the verification of numerical simulation and experiment...|$|R
30|$|An {{objective}} of this step is rough positioning of a ring part to a shaft part. Firstly, the robotic manipulator picks up a ring part from a feeder. Then, the robotic manipulator approaches the shaft part and releases the ring part on the shaft part. In this case of precise assembly of a ring part, the assembly cannot succeed because a <b>clearance</b> between a <b>ring</b> part and a shaft part disappears by deformation of the ring part. Therefore, the ring part is released once. On the other hand, if the positional difference between the ring part and the shaft part is large, the ring part falls from a shaft part. Therefore, {{it is assumed that}} the robotic manipulator is controlled with possible accuracy.|$|R

30|$|Advantages of {{the hollows}} on fingers are as follows: {{prevention}} of ring deformation, geometrical restriction of a ring part, giving optimal mating force to a ring part. The first advantage is prevention of ring deformation. A ring part {{held by a}} robotic hand is deformed by grip force. This means that a <b>clearance</b> between a <b>ring</b> part and a shaft part disappears. On the other hand, a ring closed by hollows of fingers does not receive grip force. Therefore, the proposed method {{can be applied to}} any material rings. The second advantage is geometrical restriction of a ring part. A position and an angle of a ring part are restricted by the hollows of fingers. The successful condition of ring assembly θ<θ _m in the previous section is satisfied by the hollows of fingers. This means that a ring part can be assembled without jamming.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the relationships between the total oral clearance of propranolol and the partial clearances through its primary metabolic pathways, i. e. glucuronidation, side-chain oxidation and ring oxidation. Seven young, white males were given single 80 mg oral doses of the drug together with tritium-labelled propranolol. Plasma propranolol was measured by GC/MS and fourteen metabolites were measured in urine by h. p. l. c. with radiometric detection. The total oral clearance of propranolol in these subjects varied about three-fold, from 27. 5 to 71. 4 ml min- 1 kg- 1. The clearance through glucuronidation was very similar in all subjects, ranging from 6. 8 to 9. 9 ml min- 1 kg- 1. The clearance through side-chain oxidation varied 2. 4 -fold, from 10. 9 to 25. 8 ml min- 1 kg- 1. Increased clearance through this pathway correlated with increased total oral clearance (r = 0. 84; P less than 0. 02). The <b>clearance</b> through <b>ring</b> oxidation varied as much as 5. 6 -fold, from 7. 5 to 41. 8 ml min- 1 kg- 1. Increased clearance through this pathway correlated highly with increased total oral clearance (r = 0. 94; P less than 0. 002). These observations indicate that the intersubject variability in the oral clearance of propranolol in young, white males is due mainly to differences in the activity of the ring oxidation pathway, to some extent in the side-chain oxidation pathway, but not to differences in the glucuronidation pathway. The partial metabolic clearance approach adopted in this study may be useful in the investigation of factors influencing the oral bioavailability of propranolol...|$|R
40|$|As one of {{the most}} common faults, rotor {{imbalance}} in a turbocharger will give rise to the bending vibration, which may cause damage to and even destroy the bearings and impellers. Therefore, it is necessary to detect rotor imbalance as early as possible. The present paper develops a mathematical model for investigating the rotor dynamic characteristics of a commercial automotive turbocharger supported on floating ring bearings. In order to reveal the behaviours of oil film instabilities the model takes into account nonlinear hydrodynamic oil film forces instead of linearization. A two-dimensional elastic collision model is introduced to deal with the rub-impact process between such solid parts as journal, floating ring and the bearing. In addition, the change of <b>clearances</b> in floating <b>ring</b> bearing due to temperature increases are also estimated by ignoring the variation of lubricating oil viscosity. Following model development, a numerical simulation is implemented to study the bending vibration of the turbocharger and floating ring bearing under the influence of rotor imbalance. This study paves a foundation for the monitoring of turbochargers...|$|R
40|$|The present {{configuration}} of Helium Buffer Seal on the ATD oxygen pump {{consists of a}} pair of opposed carbon rings are forced axially against their containment housings. Leakage occurs through the <b>clearance</b> between the <b>rings</b> and the shaft. The total helium leakage through both sides is approximately 239 SCFM. A reduction in leakage to 50 SCFM will result in less helium storage and consequently permit a substantial increase in payload. Under Phase 1 NASA SBIR, a solid T-Ring seal was analyzed and designed that could satisfy the criteria of reducing leakage to 50 SCFM or less. The design makes maximum use of available length and employs a mid length row of hydrostatic orifaces that feed buffer helium directly into a 2 to 3 mil clearance region. The flow splits into opposite paths to buffer oxygen gas on one side and hydrogen gas on the turbine side. The seal employs opposed hydrostatic tapered land secondary seals that provide friction free support of the primary seal and allows the primary seal to follow rotor excursion and maintain concentric operating clearance. The predicted performance of the T-seal is excellent with operation at a safe film thickness of 2 to 2. 5 mils and leakage less than 50 SCFM...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{zoonotic}} parasite Plasmodium knowlesi {{has become}} {{the most common cause of}} human malaria in Malaysia and is present throughout much of southeast Asia. No randomised controlled trials have been done to identify the optimum treatment for this emerging infection. We aimed to compare artesunate-mefloquine with chloroquine to define the optimum treatment for uncomplicated P knowlesi malaria in adults and children. Methods: We did this open-label, randomised controlled trial at three district hospitals in Sabah, Malaysia. Patients aged 1 year or older with uncomplicated P knowlesi malaria were randomly assigned, via computer-generated block randomisation (block sizes of 20), to receive oral artesunate-mefloquine (target dose 12 mg/kg artesunate and 25 mg/kg mefloquine) or chloroquine (target dose 25 mg/kg). Research nursing staff were aware of group allocation, but allocation was concealed from the microscopists responsible for determination of the primary endpoint, and study participants were not aware of drug allocation. The primary endpoint was parasite clearance at 24 h. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01708876. Findings: Between Oct 16, 2012, and Dec 13, 2014, we randomly assigned 252 patients to receive either artesunate-mefloquine (n= 127) or chloroquine (n= 125); 226 (90 %) patients comprised the modified intention-to-treat population. 24 h after treatment, we recorded parasite clearance in 97 (84 % [95 % CI 76 - 91]) of 115 patients in the artesunate-mefloquine group versus 61 (55 % [45 - 64]) of 111 patients in the chloroquine group (difference in proportion 29 % [95 % CI 18 · 0 - 40 · 8]; p< 0 · 0001). Parasite clearance was faster in patients given artesunate-mefloquine than in those given chloroquine (18 · 0 h [range 6 · 0 - 48 · 0] vs 24 · 0 h [6 · 0 - 60 · 0]; p< 0 · 0001), with faster <b>clearance</b> of <b>ring</b> stages in the artesunate-mefloquine group (mean time to 50 % clearance of baseline parasites 8 · 6 h [95 % CI 7 · 9 - 9 · 4] vs 13 · 8 h [12 · 1 - 15 · 4]; p< 0 · 0001). Risk of anaemia within 28 days was lower in patients in the artesunate-mefloquine group (71 [62 %; 95 % CI 52 · 2 - 70 · 6]) than in those in the chloroquine group (83 [75 %; 65 · 6 - 82 · 5]; p= 0 · 035). Gametocytaemia as detected by PCR for pks 25 was present in 44 (86 %) of 51 patients in the artesunate-mefloquine group and 41 (84 %) of 49 patients in the chloroquine group at baseline, and in three (6 %) of 49 patients and two (4 %) of 48 patients, respectively, at day 7. Fever clearance was faster in the artesunate-mefloquine group (mean 11 · 5 h [95 % CI 8 · 3 - 14 · 6]) than in the chloroquine group (14 · 8 h [11 · 7 - 17 · 8]; p= 0 · 034). Bed occupancy was 2426 days per 1000 patients in the artesunate-mefloquine group versus 2828 days per 1000 patients in the chloroquine group (incidence rate ratio 0 · 858 [95 % CI 0 · 812 - 0 · 906]; p< 0 · 0001). One (< 1 %) patient in the artesunate-mefloquine group had a serious neuropsychiatric event regarded as probably related to study drug. Interpretation: Artesunate-mefloquine is highly efficacious for treatment of uncomplicated P knowlesi malaria. The rapid therapeutic response of the drug offers significant advantages compared with chloroquine monotherapy and supports a unified treatment policy for artemisinin-based combination therapy for all Plasmodium species in co-endemic areas.

40|$|Characterizing {{the piston}} ring {{behavior}} is inherently {{associated with the}} oil consumption, friction, wear and blow-by in internal combustion engines. This behavior varies along the ring's circumference and determining these variations is of utmost importance for developing ring-packs achieving desired performances in terms of sealing and conformability. This study based on straight beam model was already developed but does not consider the lubrication sub-models, the tip gap effects and the characterization of the ring free shape based on any final closed shape. In this work, three numerical curved beam based models were developed to study {{the performance of the}} piston ring-pack. The conformability model was developed to characterize the behavior of the ring within the engine. In this model, the curved beam model is adopted with considering ring-bore and ring-groove interactions. This interactions include asperity and lubrication forces. Besides, gas forces are included to the model along with the inertia and initial ring tangential load. In this model we also allow for bore, groove upper and lower flanks thermal distortion. We also take into account the thermal expansion effect of the ring and the temperature gradient from inner diameter (ID) to outer diameter (OD) effects. The piston secondary motion and the variation of oil viscosity on the liner with its temperature in addition to the existence of fuel and the different hydrodynamic cases (Partially and fully flooded cases) are considered as well. This model revealed the ring position relative to the groove depending on the friction, inertia and gas pressures. It also characterizes the effect of non-uniform oil distribution on the liner and groove flanks. Finally, the ring gap position within a distorted bore also reveals the sealing performance of the ring. Using the curved beam model we also developed a module determining the twist calculation under fix ID or OD constraint. The static twist is an experimental characterization of the ring during which the user taps on the ring till there is a minimum <b>clearance</b> between the <b>ring</b> lowest point and the lower plate all over the ring's circumference but without any force contact. Our last model includes four sub-models that relate the ring free shape, its final shape when subjected to a constant radial pressure (this final shape is called ovality) and the force distribution in circular bore. Knowing one of these distribution, this model determines the other two. This tool is useful {{in the sense that the}} characterization of the ring is carried out by measuring its ovality which is more accurate than measuring its free shape or force distribution in circular bore. Thus, having a model that takes the ovality as an input is more convenient and useful based on the experiments carried out to characterize the ring. by Mohamed Aziz Bhouri. Thesis: S.
