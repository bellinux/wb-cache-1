5|$|Edward Felt dialed 9-1-1 {{from his}} cell phone from the rear {{lavatory}} of the aircraft seeking information at 09:58. His <b>call</b> <b>was</b> answered by dispatcher John Shaw, and Felt was able {{to tell him about}} the hijacking before the <b>call</b> <b>was</b> disconnected. Multiple news reports (originally based on a 9-1-1 supervisor's account after having overheard the call) asserted that Edward Felt reported hearing an explosion and seeing smoke from an undetermined location on the plane. These reports were not corroborated by Shaw or Felt's wife, Sandra, who listened to the recording afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Culbreth was {{the left}} field umpire for the single-game playoff between the Colorado Rockies and the San Diego Padres that decided the NL's 2007 wild card team.

5|$|The {{first port}} of <b>call</b> <b>was</b> Funchal in the Madeira Islands, which Endeavour reached on 12 September.

50|$|The {{two most}} common high quality duck <b>call</b> {{materials}} <b>are</b> wood and acrylic. The key difference between wood and acrylic duck <b>calls</b> <b>is</b> that acrylic <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> much louder and carry much further than wood duck <b>calls.</b> This <b>is</b> important for {{different types of}} duck hunting. Acrylic <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> preferred in large, open spaces for a call {{to reach out and}} find the ducks. When hunting in timber or swampy area, a wood <b>call</b> <b>is</b> preferable. Another key difference is that acrylic is known to show less sound variance over the temperature ranges expected in a duck blind.|$|R
50|$|International {{telephone}} <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> {{those made}} between different countries. These telephone <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> processed by international gateway exchanges (switches). Charges for these <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> high initially but declined greatly during the 20th century due to {{advances in technology}} and liberalization. Originally they were placed via long-distance operators. The <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> transmitted by cable, communications satellite, radio, and more recently, fiber optics and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). International Direct Dialling {{was introduced in the}} 1970s, so <b>calls</b> can <b>be</b> dialed by country code without an operator.|$|R
5|$|A {{screening}} of The <b>Call</b> <b>was</b> {{held at the}} Women's International Film Festival hosted at the Regal South Beach theater on February 26, 2013. TriStar Pictures released it to theatres on March 15, 2013. Considered to be high-concept by many reviewers, the film proved a commercial success, grossing over $68 million against budget of $13 million. Halle Berry was nominated for Choice Movie Actress in a Drama at the Teen Choice Awards and Best Actress at the BET Awards while the film itself received mixed reviews from critics, but praised Berry's performance and the film's suspense.|$|E
5|$|According to Boxoffice, The <b>Call</b> <b>was</b> {{expected}} to earn about $11–12 million on its opening weekend in 2,507 theaters across the United States but surpassed this {{by a significant}} margin and grossed $17 million in its first three days. This indicated good profits, as the film cost about $13 million to produce and TriStar Pictures paid a much smaller amount to acquire U.S. distribution rights. With box office takings of over $68 million, The Call is WWE Studios' most commercially successful film to date, the previous top-grossing productions being See No Evil, which stars professional wrestler Kane (Glenn Jacobs) ($19 million) and 12 Rounds, which stars professional wrestler John Cena ($17 million).|$|E
5|$|Annalee <b>Call</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{written for}} Angelina Jolie; although Jolie auditioned, she {{turned down the}} role and Winona Ryder was cast in December 1996. Call had a generally negative critical reception, largely due to a perceived lack of synergy with the film and the franchise. Roger Ebert praised Ryder's acting, but felt {{that she did not}} bring a strong presence or purpose to the film except as a familiar face to younger viewers. Nordling agreed in a 2012 Ain't It Cool News analysis, saying that Call's synthetic origin is unnecessary and her only role is that of a surrogate audience.|$|E
50|$|The <b>call</b> <b>is</b> a querulous kiew, kiew. Less frequently, various {{whistling}} or trilling <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> uttered.

5|$|Hunter recalls being pleasantly {{surprised}} to learn that Russ Tamblyn and Richard Beymer had been cast as regular characters in the series, having enjoyed the early work of both actors during the 1950s and 1960s. Tamblyn improvised elements of his performance, including a magic trick involving two golf balls, which was something he had learned and wished to include during his role in the episode. The character of Gordon Cole, first played by Lynch in this episode as a voice in a telephone <b>call,</b> <b>was</b> conceived as being hard of hearing; this was because Lynch liked the idea of delivering his lines in a loud voice, and worked backwards to establish a reason for this. Engels wrote most of Cole's dialogue over the series, having had experience with his own mother being similarly hard of hearing.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Matt Smith) and {{his companions}} Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) receive a distress call from a living Time Lord, though all {{other members of the}} Doctor's race were thought to be extinct. However, they discover that the <b>call</b> <b>was</b> bait to lure the Doctor to an asteroid outside the universe, where previously the energy of Time Lords' TARDISes has been consumed by an entity called the House (voiced by Michael Sheen). The matrix of the Doctor's TARDIS is removed and placed in the body of a woman named Idris (Suranne Jones), who proceeds to help them escape.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Georgia outplayed Vanderbilt. The Commodores had two first downs {{in the first}} half, both because of Bulldog penalties. A Commodore punt was {{returned}} 15 yards by Georgia to the Vanderbilt 30-yard line, and the Bulldogs completed an 18-yard pass from Dick Hartley to halfback Jim Tom Reynolds on Vanderbilt's 12-yard line. After three short gains, Hartley advanced five yards and Vanderbilt was penalized for being offside. Jim Reynolds, gaining a yard or so, went over for the touchdown with a counter on the following series; the close <b>call</b> <b>was</b> disputed. At {{the end of the}} half, Georgia had gained 113 yards to Vanderbilt's nine.|$|E

5|$|Investigators {{from the}} Department of Civil Aviation {{believed}} water {{in some of}} the fuel tanks of VH-ANA was responsible for rough running of {{one or more of the}} engines; and this ultimately led to intermittent failure of all the engines. The Inquiry led by Mr Justice Simpson found no evidence that there was significant water in the fuel tanks. No radio <b>call</b> <b>was</b> received from Amana to indicate the nature of any problem, or even that the crew was aware of a problem. The Inquiry concluded without determining the cause of the crash.|$|E
5|$|On August 9, {{the same}} day ETA claimed {{responsibility}} for the July 30 attack, four bombs exploded in three restaurants and one shopping centre around Palma. The bombs, which contained small amounts of explosives and caused little damage and no injuries, went off after three warning calls from ETA. At 11:16 am local time, a man speaking on behalf of ETA called the firefighters of Calvià, warning that three bombs would go off in Palma. Half an hour later, another person also speaking on behalf of ETA called a taxi company in Gipuzkoa, giving details of the location and time the bombs would explode. Finally, another warning <b>call</b> <b>was</b> mistakenly made to the personal mobile phone of an inhabitant of Córdoba. Authorities reported that the bombers had given contradicting details in each call, leading to confusion on the location of the bombs.|$|E
5|$|On {{checking}} {{records of}} telephone calls {{made to the}} dealer, the police found that some had been made from a mobile phone registered in Ireland, and on further checking the records of that phone {{it appeared that the}} calls were made from locations consistent with the known whereabouts of the Ford truck. One <b>call</b> <b>was</b> to a known IRA member. The phone was last used at 9:23am {{on the morning of the}} bombing, just three minutes after the bombers had parked their truck in Corporation Street. On 27 June, the phone's registered owner reported that it had been stolen 17days earlier, but the police felt they had gathered enough evidence to bring a prosecution against the six IRA men held in London.|$|E
