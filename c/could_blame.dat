The lab member knew he <b>could</b> <b>blame</b> it on PHAT.

Veronica has a heartfelt conversation with Piz, although soon afterward, she goes back to Logan. Keith decides to take the case of Dean O’Dell’s death.

25|$|Many Gore {{supporters}} {{claimed that}} third-party candidate Nader {{acted as a}} spoiler in the election since Nader votes could have been cast for Gore, and for instance, Nader allegedly threw the election outcome to Bush. Nader received 2.74 {{percent of the popular}} vote nationwide, getting 97,000 votes in Florida (by comparison, there were 111,251 overvotes) and 22,000 votes in New Hampshire, where Bush beat Gore by 7,000 votes. Winning either state would have won the general election for Gore. Defenders of Nader, including Dan Perkins, argued that the margin in Florida was small enough that Democrats <b>could</b> <b>blame</b> any number of third-party candidates for the defeat, including Workers World Party candidate Monica Moorehead, who received 1,500 votes. But the controversy with Nader also drained energy from the Democratic party as divisive debate went on in the months leading up to the election.|$|E
25|$|The {{preparations}} {{were left}} {{in the hands of}} Prime Minister Ernestas Galvanauskas. While he delegated specific tasks, the grand plan was kept secret even from the First Seimas or Ministry of Foreign Affairs and thus very few Lithuanians understood the full role of the government in the revolt. Thus the main credit for organization of the revolt is sometimes given to Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius, Chairman of the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union, which provided the manpower. Galvanauskas planned to present the revolt as a genuine uprising of the local population against its German Directorate and not against the French or Allied administration. Such plan was designed to direct Allied protests away from the Lithuanian government and to exploit anti-German sentiment in Europe. Galvanauskas was careful to hide any links between the rebels and the Lithuanian government so that if the revolt failed he <b>could</b> <b>blame</b> the Riflemen and the rebels absolving the government of any responsibility. Galvanauskas warned that all those involved could be subject to criminal persecutions if it was necessary for Lithuania's prestige.|$|E

500|$|... "Blink" [...] is {{the third}} story of the revived series to be adapted for {{television}} by the same writer from a piece of their spin-off writing. It follows the [...] "Human Nature" [...] and [...] "The Family of Blood" [...] story arc, which was adapted by Paul Cornell from his 1995 novel Human Nature; and [...] "Dalek", which used the basic premise {{as well as several}} scenes and lines of dialogue adapted by Robert Shearman from his 2003 audio drama Jubilee. [...] "Blink" [...] is referred to as a [...] "Doctor-Lite" [...] episode because the Doctor and his companion have very little screen time. This allowed two episodes to be filmed simultaneously, a process known as [...] "double banking". The practice had begun with the 2006 entry [...] "Love & Monsters", and would continue for episodes such as [...] "Turn Left", [...] "Midnight", and [...] "The Girl Who Waited". Moffat stated that he felt relaxed when he was writing the script for [...] "Blink", for if it proved to be unpopular, he <b>could</b> <b>blame</b> the [...] "Doctor-lite" [...] structure of the episode. Due to the show's tight schedule, [...] "Blink" [...] had only one script meeting.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Obama's former Secretary of State and 2016 presidential {{candidate}} Hillary Clinton strongly endorsed the decision.

Moreover, the embargo did not have any impact on freedom of speech, freedom of expression, or on freeing political prisoners.” ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{often said}} that even within the narrow {{boundaries}} of the concentration camps he found only two races of Men to exist: decent ones and unprincipled ones.

2500|$|When Court TV confronted Grace {{seven months}} later to ask whether she was {{incorrect}} in her assertion that Ricci was guilty, {{and whether or not}} she felt bad about it in any way, she stated that Ricci was [...] "a known ex-con, a known felon, and brought suspicion on himself, so who <b>could</b> <b>blame</b> anyone for claiming he was the perpetrator?" [...] When Larry King asked her about the matter, she equated criticism of herself with criticism of the police in the case. She said: [...] "I'm not letting you take the police with me on a guilt trip." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2012, a show source told Inside Soap that Christmas 2012 would [...] "bring {{serious drama}} to the Moons" [...] with the reveal {{of the mystery}} man's {{identity}} and the aftermath: [...] "the consequences will be felt across the Square. Who <b>could</b> <b>blame</b> Alfie if he kicked Kat to the kerb? She has treated him appallingly." [...] It was revealed Kat would reveal the identity of her lover during an episode in which Kat and Alfie argue, Alfie attacks {{one of the suspects}} and Kat shouts that he has the wrong brother. An EastEnders source told the Daily Star: [...] "It's the question that has been on everyone's lips for months—who is Kat's secret lover? The big revelation was always {{going to be in the}} Queen Vic in front of everyone and it will not disappoint. Jessie [...] and Shane [...] are both brilliant and this is one episode viewers will not want to miss. Alfie goes for one of the Branning brothers as he is convinced it's him who's been sleeping with his wife. Kat storms through the pub as he's got him on the floor and reveals the truth. We all got goosebumps as she yelled the line, 'You've got the wrong brother' [...] It really is classic Enders." [...] The source added, [...] "Sadly it doesn't look like [...] be able to get over this one." [...] EastEnders confirmed that viewers would discover the identity of Kat's lover in the episode broadcast on 20 December 2012. Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said it would be a [...] "dramatic climax" [...] to the storyline. On being told who Kat's lover is, Richie said he understood and found it clever, though he had previously thought it would be Michael or Ray. Richie told Radio Times that Alfie is still in denial about the affair but becomes Kat's [...] "stalker", following her to the bedsit. He then pieces the evidence together and realises Kat is having an affair with someone he knows.|$|E

2500|$|Pop Justice praised Scherzinger's {{choice to}} release [...] "Don't Hold Your Breath" [...] as her second single. They said [...] "For the {{follow-up}} [...] Nicole {{has taken the}} controversial move of recording a song that is also basically brilliant... It is {{nice to have a}} decent song about love because love is the official topic of pop and anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is a fool to themselves and needs to have a long sit down." [...] A review from Rap-Up agreed saying that on [...] "Don't Hold Your Breath", Scherzinger takes it the club with the [...] "empowering pop jam" [...] and declares her independence. Robbie Daw from Idolator praised the song, based just on its demo. He said [...] "Well, okay—we will allow that this song already sounds better than every Pussycat Dolls single combined." [...] Robert Copsey from Digital Spy praised the song awarding it five out of five stars. In his review, Copsey said [...] "That said, we found ourselves mildly red-faced on a recent excursion while listening to Nicole Scherzinger's latest chart assault...

Ben Norman from About.com, in a review for Killer Love said that, [...] "'Don't Hold Your Breath' is an absolute standout {{and one of the best}} tracks she has offered in any association she's had. Bradley Stern of MTV Buzzworthy described the song's production as [...] "gorgeous". In July 2013, The Huffington Post ranked [...] "Don't Hold Your Breath" [...] at number 23 on its list of the top 50 number ones of the last ten years. Cosmopolitan listed the song at number 9 on the magazine's [...] "Best Breakup Songs". The article also included [...] "I Don't Need a Man" [...] at number two which Scherzinger wrote for her former girl group, The Pussycat Dolls. BecomeGorgeous.com acknowledged the song as one of the best break up songs for girls saying, [...] "Nicole Scherzinger truly understands what you're going through and suggests a pretty good line to address your ex when he thinks you're coming home to make up: Don't Hold Your Breath." ...|$|E
