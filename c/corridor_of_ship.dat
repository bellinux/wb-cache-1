In the first one, distinct points are first clustered and generated nodes are connected with straight paths. In segment clustering, course partitions with similar positioning and heading are grouped together. Additionally, shipping corridors are generated around each ship lane for each method...|$|R

5000|$|In [...] "Power Outage", a {{cure for}} the {{mutagenic}} gas is developed and secretly administered to every resident in Dakota. By {{the order of the}} government, Dr. Todd sprayed the cure to every Bang Baby including Static and Gear. Another reason was that the government saw the Bang Babies as a threat and crimes were committed by them. Dr. Todd didn't want to cure Static and Gear because of their heroics. This results in every Bang Baby, Static and Gear included, losing their powers. Ebon steals a sample of the gas used to create the cure, intending to use it to restore the powers of a choice few criminals. He and Hotstreak come to blows over the canister, breaking the seal. It's not made clear how many people were exposed, as the gas never escaped the ship and there were less than a dozen people present at the time. At the very least, Ebon, Hotstreak, Gear, and Static were exposed to the gas, returning their powers. Since the gas is set off inside the <b>corridors</b> <b>of</b> a <b>ship,</b> the concentration apparently boosts their powers as well. Ebon and Hotstreak overdose on the substance, fusing into a two-headed Bang Baby with the combined powers of both men. The creature was taken down by Static blasting it off the ship, but it's unknown if the creature still lives under the waters of Dakota.|$|R
