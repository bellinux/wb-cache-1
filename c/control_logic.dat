We have previously outlined how normal multimodal logics, including monomodal logics K and S 4, can be embedded in simple type theory and we have demonstrated that the higher-order theorem prover LEO-II can automate reasoning in and about them. In this paper we combine these results and describe a sound (and complete) embedding of different access <b>control</b> <b>logics</b> in simple type theory. Employing this framework we show that the off the shelf theorem prover LEO-II {{can be applied to}} automate reasoning in and about prominent access <b>control</b> <b>logics.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{evaluation}} of the impact on residential buildings of innovative <b>control</b> <b>logics</b> defined for a rational utilization of the electric loads and air-conditioning systems.

The paper shows how a significant reduction of the primary energy consumption can be obtained by controlling the air-conditioning units together with the other electric loads of the house. After having explained how the <b>control</b> <b>logics</b> operate, a simulation tool is described, developed for a preliminary evaluation of their effects on the energy consumptions of residential buildings in the design stage. An application of the simulation tool on a typical house, considering different scenarios and varying the climatic conditions and the energy performance class of the envelope, is presented.

25|$|The {{most basic}} {{feature is the}} {{integrated}} bidet, a nozzle {{the size of a}} pencil that comes out from underneath the toilet seat and squirts water. It has two settings: one for washing the anus and one for the bidet. The former is called posterior wash, general use, or family cleaning, and the latter is known as feminine cleaning, feminine wash or simply bidet. At no point does the nozzle actually touch the body of the user. The nozzle is also self-cleaning and cleans itself before and after operation. The user can select to wash the anus or vulva by pressing the corresponding button on the control panel. Usually the same nozzle is used for both operations, but at a different position of the nozzle head, and using different openings in the nozzle to squirt water at a different angle to aim for the correct spot. Occasionally, two nozzles are used, each dedicated for one area. The <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> is also attached to a pressure switch or a proximity sensor in the toilet seat, and operates only when the seat is occupied. The very first models did not include this automatic switch-off. A number of curious users pressed the button while watching the toilet to see its mode of operation, and promptly received a jet of warm water in their faces.|$|E

2500|$|The {{required}} power line is configured in de-icing mode {{after being separated}} from their AC circuit. Then, a line de-icing circuit is created {{by a set of}} [...] disconnect switches controlled by the DCU which [...] sends all of the commands to the de-icing converter. The DC current is slowly raised to reach the desired level of current. The de-icing disconnect switches are opened, and the DCU then releases the power line back to the AC network. The lines to be de-iced must stay in normal operation during the entire period of DCU development and start-up. The final installation of the SVC/ de-icer requires a de-icing line equipment pre-operational testing before being installed.The lines being de-iced must stay in normal operation during the start-up as well as throughout the whole period of DCU development. This system is rarely used, only for critical conditions as the operators would be under heavy stress and the man-machine interface (MMI) must be on guided mode. For the five lines being de-iced, there are 13 line topologies that have between 40 and 90 actions per line to be performed during the de-icing process. Out of the five lines, four have three de-icing circuit topologies and the other one only has one. The DCU must offer the possibility to manually confirm the equipment’s state to the operator in order to continue the process as there is always a chance of communication failure. Flexible stimulation sequences used for <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> and MMI validation, pre-operational testing and operator training are required for line equipment and SVC. For 735 kV lines, de-icing takes place in three steps while 315 kV double circuit lines only need one. A DCU supervises and coordinates all the actions required for de-icing each line in order to provide network security and ensure the de-icing sequences are reliable.|$|E
