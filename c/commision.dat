40|$|The Civil Service <b>Commision</b> {{was created}} in 1855 and became the key {{institution}} {{in the development of}} the British civil service. Its work was primarily the recruitment of civil servants by fair methods, treating all qualified applicants equally, and using open competitions wherever practicable. It was held in high esteem not only in the United Kingdom but also in the many other countries throughout the world which, in many places, modelled their methods of public service recruitment on its pioneering work. It continued until 1991, when most of its work was devolved to over 3, 000 government departments and executive agencies. This book describes the gestation, growth, development and eventual demise of the <b>Commision</b> and includes a number of in-depth case studies. Using source material such as official files, many only recently available for research, together with other records and evidence to official committees, the book provides a biography of an institution. It shows how the department was formally organised and there is a particular focus on how it actually worked on a day-to-day basis. With three in-depth chapters on the chronological development of the <b>Commision</b> and seven case studies of themes or issues that reveal methods of work and influences on its activities, this book uses file-based research more extensively than any other history of a British government department. The Civil Service <b>Commision,</b> 1855 - 1991 reveals insights into civil service recruitment and makes a major original contribution to our understanding of the practice and politics of public administration...|$|E
