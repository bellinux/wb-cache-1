Studies regarding predator-prey relationships in fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) crops {{are important for}} understanding essential ecological interactions {{in the context of}} intercropping and for establishing pest management programs for aphids. This study evaluated the association among Hyadaphis foeniculi (Passerini) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and Cycloneda sanguinea (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in cotton with <b>coloured</b> <b>fibres,</b> fennel and cotton intercropped with fennel. Association analysis was used to investigate whether {{the presence or absence of}} prey and predator species can indicate possible interactions between aphids and ladybugs. Significant associations among both apterous and alate H. foeniculi and C. sanguinea were observed in both the fennel and fennel-cotton intercropping systems. The similarity analysis showed that the presence of aphids and ladybugs in the same system is significantly dependent on the type of crop. A substantial amount of evidence indicates that the presence of the ladybug C. sanguinea, is associated with apterous or alate A. gossypii and H. foeniculi in fennel-cotton intercropping system. We recommend that future research vising integrated aphid management taking into account these associations for take decisions. 201...|$|E
40|$|Colour {{matching}} between carded {{and finished}} fibres {{is an important}} challenge for textile industry. The straightforward approach for mixing together some differently <b>coloured</b> <b>fibres</b> {{in order to obtain}} a blend of a desired colour is to perform a trial and error approach starting from a given colour recipe and optimizing it with several attempts. Unfortunately, dyeing process so as the carding procedure may result in a carded fibre whose colour is different from the desired one. As a consequence textile companies have to modify the original recipe {{in order to reduce the}} gap between the colour of the final product and the desired one. The present work describes a model able to simulate the colour mixing of fibres in order to assess the best recipe. The model consists in two modules: a “prediction module” predicts the colour of a blend obtained by mixing together several fibres; an “optimization module” is used to optimize the final recipe. The devised system has been tested for optimizing the recipe of a set of 200 blends. The mean error in predicting the blend colour is about 15 % with a variance of 0. 165. The time for optimizing the recipe is reduced by 92 %...|$|E

Family sized units are {{located at the}} base of the building having direct access to rear gardens, a playground and communal courtyard areas. Smaller sized units are located higher up in the towers enjoying views across London from roof terraces and balconies. A community space was designed as an integral part of the project and incorporates a rooftop sports pitch. The development makes use of a local 'Combined Heat and Power' system and includes greenwalls, bird boxes, bat boxes, insect bricks and biodiversity roofs to help develop local eco-systems. The distinctive skyline and elevations of the building include <b>coloured</b> <b>fibre</b> cement cladding panels, large overhanging canopies and projecting balconies which contrast with the restrained aesthetic of Canary Wharf.

40|$|At present, {{to provide}} wood-plastic {{composites}} (WPC) with colouration and UV-protection, pigments are added {{in powder form}} or pre-dispersed in a polymer matrix (masterbatch) during compounding. Usually, the wood particles are not coloured prior to compounding, although this may improve the colour stability of the WPC. In this research project, two types of pigments were used to pre-colour thermo-mechanical pulp: an aqueous inorganic pigment preparation based on iron oxide and a water-based preparation of organic and inorganic pigments. Pre-coloured fibres were mixed with high-density polyethylene and maleic-anhydride grafted-PE in a kneading mixer and injection-moulded. As a reference, uncoloured fibres were mixed with pigments. Colour stability of the WPC was determined as DeltaE* after 400 h of Xenon weathering. Pre-treatment of the fibres alone was not sufficient to improve colour stability of WPC. However, the use of fibres pre-treated with inorganic iron oxide pigments in combination with a pigment masterbatch to colour the polymer matrix resulted in a significant reduction of DeltaE* compared to when either pre-coloured fibres only or uncoloured fibres plus pigment were used. The mixture of organic and inorganic pigments was less effective in improving colour stability than the application of inorganic pigments only. Flexural strength and modulus of elasticity of WPC with <b>coloured</b> <b>fibres</b> were slightly reduced compared to WPC with uncoloured fibres. Water uptake was higher for WPC with organic pigments than for WPC with inorganic pigments only. Fibre pre-colouration appears useful to obtain WPC with low colour change {{as a result of}} weathering...|$|E
40|$|Classification of wasted woollen {{textiles}} {{on the basis}} of their colour is a basic approach for the supply of a raw material which does not involve the cost of the colouring process. Colour classification is a very difficult task, especially when a fabric is composed by differently <b>coloured</b> <b>fibre</b> (melange fabric). Many systems have been developed in the last years for colour classification of textiles. Unfortunately such colour classification systems are not able to correctly classify melange fabrics. In the present work a method for real-time classification of melange colour woollen fabrics is proposed. The provided approach, that is suitable also for classifying solid colour fabrics, integrates a Machine Vision (MV) system, able to acquire high resolution images, with a clustering algorithm capable of mapping the colour pixel of fabric images into a series of colour classes. The proposed system provides a colour classification with a misclassification less than 10 % when compared with the classification resulting from a panel of expert human operators. A comparison between the proposed method and some tools stated in scientific literature is also afforded...|$|R

40|$|The {{blending}} of <b>coloured</b> <b>fibre</b> is explored as a sustainable method of colouration when coupled with sustainable fibre and dyeing choices such as spun-dyed Lenzing Viscose Austria. It {{was found that}} a selection of spun-dyed colours (primaries) {{can be used to}} create homogenous 4 -colour blends when mixed in specific groups. The use of 4 -colour blends ensures that the optimal amount of colours within a gamut are produced with the lowest possible number of primaries depending on the acceptable mean colour difference of the 4 -colour blends. The acceptable mean colour difference of a blend (measured by averaging each pair of colour differences between the primaries in a blend) can be derived using example 4 -colour blends and participant observations at a set viewing distance. Using MATLAB, a method of estimating the number of primaries required to fill a given gamut in CIELAB colour space was developed. Primaries can be distributed across CIELAB colour space and grouped into tetrahedral groups of four for blending. The mean colour difference of the tetrahedral 4 -colour blends can be increased or decreased by varying the number of primaries within a gamut. It was also found that the maximum mean colour difference of blends {{in order for them to}} appear solid (when viewed at a specific viewing distance) was transferable to blends in knit form. Comparisons of existing blend prediction models with the prediction possibilities of a standard neural network and novel neural network were undertaken using data gathered from 333 blended samples. The results showed that neural networks outperformed the existing prediction models and can be successfully used to predict the colour of blends to an industry standard. The investigations of this thesis have shown that a sustainable colouration system using spun-dyed viscose blends is possible and that accurate colour predictions of these blends can be made...|$|R
40|$|Not dyed wool yarns and fabrics {{were treated}} by {{ultraviolet}} radiations, using a medium pressure Hg lamp, {{in order to}} obtain a modification onto fibre surface. As consequence, UV treated wool showed increase in metal ions absorption and hydrophilicity, together with improved kinetics of dye absorption under the same dyeing conditions as untreated wool. The surface modification of wool due to UV radiations was confirmed by FTIR-ATR analysis, nevertheless the fibre morphology by SEM analysis was unaffected. Experimental results showed that different kind of dyes are able to give differential dyeing after irradiation, but not all members of the same dyeing class have similar behaviour. Then, a selection of 1 : 1 metal-complex dyes was chosen to evidence the maximum of difference between irradiated and not irradiated areas. The main interests on wool fabrics were focused on two effects: a) one shade, double face with different depth, higher on treated side; b) two shades, double face with different colour and depth. Moreover it was found that UV pretreatment can be useful to obtain the same dyeing with lower temperature conditions (85 °C). Fastness evaluations towards dry rubbing and machine washing at 50 °C were also carried out to confirm the feasibility of this alternative dyeing technique; in all experiments carried out with selected 1 : 1 metal-complex dyes the same score of conventional premetallized 1 : 1 dyeings was obtained. Dyed cotton yarns and fabrics were treated by ultraviolet radiations, using a medium pressure Hg lamp, {{in order to obtain}} a fading of <b>coloured</b> <b>fibre</b> surface.

According to the evaluation of Hidalgo-Ruz et al. [11], concentrations of microplastics in {{the water column}} ranged from 0.014 to 12.5  items/m 3. Considerably higher concentrations were detected in a recent study [18] in the north-eastern Pacific and close to the coast of British Columbia (Canada). Concentrations of microplastics in seawater sampled from a depth of 4.5  m ranged from 8 to 9180  items/m 3. They were lowest at offshore sites in the north-eastern Pacific (mean: 279 items/m 3) and higher at nearshore sites (1710 – 7630  items/m 3). Approx. 75  % of the microplastics were fibres; the percentage of fibres increased near the shores. As noted by the authors, fibre content was underestimated: brightly <b>coloured</b> brittle <b>fibres</b> were observed in most samples, but could not be quantified since they were eliminated during acid digestion. High concentrations of microplastics (0.5  mm to approx. 5  mm) were also found in the Yangtze estuary in China [131].
