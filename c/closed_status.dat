50|$|In the United States, lane {{control signals}} are used on many toll plazas to {{indicate}} the open/closed status of toll lanes. Many older toll plazas use conventional circular red and green indications {{to indicate the}} open and <b>closed</b> <b>status</b> of toll lanes, however, the use of circular red and green signals for this purpose is now non-compliant in the 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, with lane control signals being the preferred indicator. The reason for discouraging the use of circular red and green signals for indicating the open and <b>closed</b> <b>status</b> of toll lanes is due to their use being contrary to their traditional definitions of stop and go.|$|E
5000|$|From time to time, radical Israeli right-wing {{organizations}} {{carry out}} campaigns (via posters or videos) which {{call for the}} release of Yigal Amir and his brother Hagai. Such a campaign was held in October 2007 in which the prominent Israeli singer Ariel Zilber also participated. In response to this campaign, the Israeli Internal Security Minister Avi Dichter stated: [...] "This man is in the <b>closest</b> <b>status</b> a person can be to a death sentence", and also added that, [...] "A reduction of his sentence is impossible and illogical, and it will surely accompany him until he would pass away".|$|R

5000|$|The <b>closed</b> <b>status</b> of Mezhgorye {{means that}} in {{administrative}} terms it is subordinated directly {{to the federal government}} of Russia. The town comprises two microdistricts (former settlements), located 23 km apart: Tatly (...) and Solnechny (...) (formerly called Kuzyelga (...) [...] ).|$|E
50|$|Founded in 1957, it {{was known}} as Chelyabinsk-70 until 1991. During the Soviet era, it had a <b>closed</b> <b>status</b> and not shown on maps. Additionally, civil flights over it were forbidden. Town status was granted to it in 1993.|$|E

50|$|Bolshoy Kamen {{began as}} a naval support base in 1947 and was granted urban-type {{settlement}} status in 1956, followed by town status on August 31, 1989. During the Soviet era, the town's nature as a naval base saw it designated as closed. This status was revoked in 1989, with plans for a civilian harbor in the town; however, these plans were later cancelled and the town was closed again in 1996. Effective January 1, 2015, the <b>closed</b> <b>status</b> was once again revoked.|$|E
50|$|The {{town was}} founded in 1961. From 1969 to 1994, it was called Uglegorsk and was {{established}} in order to serve the nearby ICBM base of the Soviet Armed Forces which was code-named Svobodny-18. The name was given after another settlement called Svobodny which lies 50 km south of it. The <b>closed</b> <b>status</b> was assigned by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of October 19, 1965. In 1994 the entire complex was renamed to Uglegorsk (Углего́рск).|$|E
30|$|The second {{endogenous}} {{effect is}} the inter-group comparison between multiple principals. Reference group and relative comparison theories {{state that the}} comparative objects of individuals, groups, and organizations {{are more likely to}} be reference objects with more daily interactions, <b>close</b> <b>status,</b> or similar characteristics. Once a reference group is formed, these reference groups establish a competitive relationship, either explicitly or implicitly (Festinger 1954; Merton 1957; Akerlof 1982), such as comparing their history, prospects, positive or negative information, or improved conditions (Weick 1979). In the process of comparison, the groups may form a certain sense of relative deprivation or relative satisfaction. In the flat structure, because multiple principals have a similar status, they are more likely to form inter-group comparison and compete for the sole agent’s attention.|$|R
40|$|An air venting element on microchannel, {{which can}} be {{controlled}} externally and automatically, was demonstrated for manipulating liquid plugs in microfluidic systems. The element’s open and <b>closed</b> <b>statuses</b> correspond to the positioning and movement of a liquid plug in the microchannel. Positioning of multiple liquid plugs at an air venting element enabled the merging and mixing of the plugs. Besides these basic functions, other modes of liquid plug manipulations including plug partitioning, multiple plug mixing, and spacing adjustment between liquid plugs, were realized using combination of multiple elements. The structure, operation, and some functions of the element were demonstrated with a microfluidic chip application. The performances of the element including its failure modes, threshold flow rate, and structural optimization were also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{road and}} rail {{accidents}} are increasing {{with the advancement}} of human errors. Majority of the level crossing positions are not guided by any accident preventive mechanism and even not accompanied by a skilled person. This paper presents an automatic rail gate control system at level crossing positions and accident prevention mechanism. Two vibration sensors are used to control the open and close state of the gate at level crossing position. An ultrasonic sensor is positioned to detect an unauthorized object on the track. Open and <b>Close</b> <b>status</b> of the gate and unauthorized object on the track will be communicated with the central control room using wireless communication protocol. The experimental results proved the proposed mechanism is a prudent approach to safeguard the human and to curtail the train accidents. Keywords: Rail gate, Vibration sensor, ultrasonic sensor...|$|R
50|$|A {{machine tool}} relay {{is a type}} {{standardized}} for industrial control of machine tools, transfer machines, and other sequential control. They are characterized by {{a large number of}} contacts (sometimes extendable in the field) which are easily converted from normally open to normally <b>closed</b> <b>status,</b> easily replaceable coils, and a form factor that allows compactly installing many relays in a control panel. Although such relays once were the backbone of automation in such industries as automobile assembly, the programmable logic controller (PLC) mostly displaced the machine tool relay from sequential control applications.|$|E
50|$|The open or <b>closed</b> <b>status</b> of word classes varies between languages, even {{assuming}} that corresponding word classes exist. Most conspicuously, in many languages verbs and adjectives form closed classes of content words. An extreme example {{is found in}} Jingulu, which has only three verbs, while even the modern Indo-European Persian has {{no more than a}} few hundred simple verbs, a great deal of which are archaic. (Some twenty Persian verbs are used as light verbs to form compounds; this lack of lexical verbs is shared with other Iranian languages.) Japanese is similar, having few lexical verbs. Basque verbs are also a closed class, with the vast majority of verbal senses instead expressed periphrastically.|$|E
5000|$|In 1958, uranium prospectors {{settled the}} site of modern Aktau, naming the {{settlement}} Melovoye (...) after the bay on which it stood. After {{the development of the}} uranium deposits was started, the settlement was closed and renamed Guryev-20 (...) [...] In 1963, its <b>closed</b> <b>status</b> was lifted, town status was granted, and the name was changed to Aktau. However, in 1964 it was given yet another name, Shevchenko (...) , to honor the Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko who spent 1850-1857 in political exile in Novopetrovskoye, about 100 km to the northwest. [...] This Ukrainian name for the city may have been granted due to the large number of Ukrainian workers who settled in the city. Their descendants are easily identifiable to this day by surnames ending in '-enko'. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Kazakhstan gaining independence, the name Aktau was restored in 1991, but the city's airport still retains SCO as its IATA code.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the release}} of their first album on Folkways Records, The Fugs signed a {{contract}} allowing ESP-Disk to publish its material in exchange for usage of an Off-Broadway theater as practice space and what Fugs' frontman Ed Sanders describes as [...] "one of the lower percentages {{in the history of}} western civilization. While finding the contract binding and disadvantageous in many ways, The Fugs were pleased with the opportunity to work with and at the studio of Richard Alderson, who allowed them to experiment with his state-of-the-art equipment. The album was produced over a four-week period through January and February 1966 {{at the same time that}} the band was performing weekly at the Astor Place Playhouse and making television appearances with David Susskind and Les Crane. The band's controversial lyrics and stage antics allegedly attracted the attention of the FBI and New York City fire and building inspectors and eventually resulted in their being banned from Astor Place Playhouse. According to Sanders, the FBI's final report of its investigation of the band concluded that [...] "The Fugs is a group of musicians who perform in NYC. They are considered to be beatniks and free thinkers, i.e., free love, free use of narcotics, etc. .... it is recommended that this case be placed in a <b>closed</b> <b>status</b> since the recording is not considered to be obscene." [...] Sanders jokes that [...] "If we'd only known about this, we could have put a disclaimer on the record, 'Ruled NOT obscene by the FBI!'" ...|$|E

40|$|Option {{models have}} {{provided}} {{insight into the}} value of flexibility to switch from one state to another (such as switching a mine or refinery from operating to <b>closed</b> <b>status).</b> More complex flexible processes offer multiple possibilities for switching states. A fabrication facility, for example, may offer options to shift from the current status to any of several alternatives (reflecting reconfiguration of basic facilities to accommodate different operating processes with different outputs). New algorithms enable practical application of complex option pricing models to flexible facilities, improving analysts’ ability to draw sound conclusions {{about the effects of}} flexibility and innovativeness on share value. Careful attention to estimating the matrix of correlations among the values of potential alternative states allows explicit integration of financial analysis and strategic analysis—especially the influence of substitutes and the anticipated reactions of competitors, suppliers, and potential new entrants...|$|E

40|$|This study empirically {{characterizes the}} {{interdependence}} in cyber attacks and examines the impact {{from the first}} international treaty against cybercrimes (Convention on Cybercrimes: Europe Treaty Series No. 185). With the data covering 62 countries over the period from year 2003 to 2007, we find that, international cooperation in enforcement {{as measured by the}} indicator of joining the Convention on Cybercrimes, deterred cyber attacks originating from any particular country by 15. 81 % ~ 24. 77 % (in 95 % confidence interval). Second, joining the Convention also affected the interdependence in cyber attacks from two angels. First, for any pair of country, <b>closer</b> <b>status</b> in joining or not joining the Convention was associated with less negative or more positive correlation. Second, joining the Convention or joining it earlier was associated with lower correlation between countries over time. We discuss the policy implications from our findings to public authorities, cyber insurance companies and organizational users. 1...|$|R
40|$|The general dynamic network yield {{management}} problem is {{studied in the}} context of airline operations. We assume that booking requests on the itineraries follow independent inhomogeneous Poisson processes along the time prior to departure. The {{yield management}} policy dynamically determines acceptance or rejection of the booking requests from each itinerary on the network in order to maximize the total expected revenue. The necessity and sufficiency conditions of the optimal policy are examined. These conditions determine the pivotal points when policy changes take place. An optimal solution is proposed. We show that the threshold policy in which open and <b>closed</b> <b>statuses</b> of a fare class alternate is a solution structure general to the dynamic network yield management problem. Particularly, this study shows that the single leg case, which has been successfully solved, is a special case of the general network problem. In addition, enabled by the optimal solution, we gain many insights through example for the first time. ...|$|R
30|$|It is {{supposed}} that the deeply inserted nasal airway caused critical abdominal distention by insufflating the HHFNC {{flow into the}} gastrointestinal rather than the respiratory tract. In the early stage before the development of critical abdominal distention, the HHFNC flow might have partially supported his breathing; however, {{it is likely that}} the HHFNC flow gradually became ineffective for supporting his breathing because of aerophagia. In addition, his gastroesophageal reflux might have worsened the situation because aerophagia is possibly accelerated by noninvasive positive airway pressure in patients with gastroesophageal reflux [5]. Abdominal compartment syndrome related to noninvasive ventilation was also reported [6]. In a pediatric model, a linear relationship between flow and pressures measured in the pharynx (pressure = −[*] 0.375 [*]+[*] 0.138 × flow) with the closed-mouth condition was reported. According to this model, 2.4  cm H 2 O of positive pressure was generated in our patient at that time. This low level of pressure might unusually force air into the stomach; however, the positive pressure drastically increased with a high nasal prong-to-nares ratio and mouth <b>closed</b> <b>status</b> [7]. Therefore, it might be a little wonder that a positive pressure high enough to open the esophageal sphincter was generated according to the circumstances, which caused the gastrointestinal overdistention. To confirm the location of the tip of the nasal airway, we could have used a fine fiberoptic bronchoscopy as an option. We should have carefully monitored the patient considering the development of this adverse event.|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{characteristics}} of AFDC cases active in Linn County, Oregon in June 1966 and of the difference in characteristics between those cases closed by September 1, 1967, and those cases remaining active on that date. The source of data was the case records of the Linn County Department of Public Welfare. There were 212 cases in the study with 200 suitable for full analysis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that there is a difference in selected characteristics between cases remaining active and cases that close. Case records were read and then characteristics tallied. The cases that were in <b>closed</b> <b>status</b> at the end of 15 months were compared with the characteristics of the cases remaining active. Findings confirmed the hypothesis with respect to two characteristics in which there were statistically significant differences. These were family composition and work experience. A large family limited the possibility of termination, but experience in a trade increased the probability of termination. Education level and age of mother were not found to be significant. The unmarried mother tended to remain active, but this finding was influenced by size of family. Question was raised about the reliability of information in case records concerning sexual behavior and use of alcohol. The woman with chronic medical problems was found to have a better than average frequency of termination. The impact of vocational training and group therapy was not significant for remaining active or terminating...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} sheep farms {{from across the}} UK was {{conducted}} to establish information on farming practices, the trichostrongylid nematode species present and anthelmintic usage. Questionnaires and faecal samples were returned from 118 farms. First stage larvae (L 1) were cultured from faecal samples and used for PCR analysis to determine the presence/absence of selected trichostrongylid species. Teladorsagia circumcincta was the only species present on 100 % of farms. Haemonchus contortus was found on ∼ 50 % of farms and was widespread throughout the UK. The most common Trichostrongylus spp. was T. vitrinus, found on 95 % of farms. Determining the anthelmintic dose rate based on {{the weight of the}} heaviest animal in the flock to avoid under dosing was carried out on 58 % of farms and was associated with a significantly lower mean epg (p &# 60;  0. 001) in lambs. However, the weight of animals was only estimated (as opposed to animals weighed) on 32 % of farms. Macrocyclic lactones (ML) were the most commonly used anthelmintic class for ewes, whilst benzimidazoles (BZ) were the most widely used in lambs. Twenty-two of the surveyed farms had confirmed anthelmintic resistance, of these, 18 had BZ resistance, one had levamisole (LEV) resistance and 3 had resistance to both BZ and LEV. No farms in this survey reported resistance to ML. Location had a significant effect on the incidence of anthelmintic resistance on the farms in this survey (p =  0. 002). There was evidence of a lower risk of anthelmintic resistance occurring on farms from Scotland compared to those in England (pf =  0. 047) and Wales (pf =  0. 012). Farm type, flock type and open or <b>closed</b> <b>status</b> did not have any significant effect on the incidence of anthelmintic resistance when all other factors were taken into consideration...|$|E
