Hence, although some simple silicic acids have been identified in dilute solutions, such as orthosilicic acid Si(OH)4 and metasilicic acid SiO(OH)2, none of these are likely to exist in the solid state.|$|E

40|$|Photonic bandgap (PBG) {{structures}} are artificial materials which are featured with periodically changed refractive index having a periodicity {{in the range}} of optical wavelengths. The studies in PBG {{structures are}} making rapid progress. However, the investigations of three-dimensional (3 -D) PBG structures are still challenging. ^ In this work, laser-assisted fabrication of 3 -D PBG structures based on self-assembled <b>silica</b> <b>colloidal</b> crystals was developed. 3 -D PBG structures were fabricated by laser-assisted nano-imprinting and laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition (LCVD), based on the self-assembled <b>silica</b> <b>colloidal</b> crystals. <b>Silica</b> <b>colloidal</b> crystals were self-assembled on silicon substrates using isothermal heating evaporation-induced self-assembly. To infiltrate the <b>silica</b> <b>colloidal</b> crystals, the laser-assisted imprinting technique was used using a short pulse (23 ns pulse duration) of a KrF excimer laser. The nanosecond laser pulse instantaneously melted the silicon substrates, which infiltrated and solidified over the assembled silica particles on the substrates. By removing silica particles embedded in the silicon using hydrofluoric acid, inverseopal PBG structures were produced. In the LCVD technique, a continuous-wave Nd:YAG laser (1. 064 μm wavelength) and a CO 2 laser (10. 6 μm wavelength) were used as the energy source. Silica-core-silicon-shell PBG structures were obtained. This technique is capable of fabricating structures with various PBGs by obtaining different silicon-shell thickness with different LCVD parameters. ^ Both theoretical calculations and experimental measurements to investigate the optical properties of the PBG structures were carried out. Spectroscopic ellipsometry was used to identify PBGs. The plain-wave expansion (PWE) method was used to calculate the photonic-band diagrams of the structures, which agreed with the experimental results. The calculation also provided fitting results of the Si-shell thicknesses. ^ To investigate the properties of PBG structures and develop functional devices, a 2 -D electrically tunable PBG device was designed using the PWE method. After the designing the structure materials and the structural parameters, the behavior of the tunable PBG device is simulated with the FDTD method. To explore the optical properties of 3 -D PBG structures, a method of analyzing the optical refraction in 3 -D PBG structures is proposed, with which it is possible to calculate the refraction light path in an arbitrary 3 -D PBG structure using a personal computer. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which amorphous silica dissolves have proven elusive because noncrystalline materials lack the structural order {{that allows them to}} be studied by the classical terrace, ledge, kink-based models applied to crystals. This would seem to imply amorphous phases have surfaces that are disordered at an atomic scale so that the transfer of SiO 4 tetrahedra to solution always leaves the surface free energy of the solid unchanged. As a consequence, dissolution rates of amorphous phases should simply scale linearly with increasing driving force (undersaturation) through the higher probability of detaching silica tetrahedra. By examining rate measurements for two amorphous SiO 2 glasses we find, instead, a paradox. In electrolyte solutions, these silicas show the same exponential dependence on driving force as their crystalline counterpart, quartz. We analyze this enigma by considering that amorphous silicas present two predominant types of surface-coordinated silica tetrahedra to solution. Electrolytes overcome the energy barrier to nucleated detachment of higher coordinated species to create a periphery of reactive, lesser coordinated groups that increase surface energy. The result is a plausible mechanism-based model that is formally identical with the classical polynuclear theory developed for crystal growth. The model also accounts for reported demineralization rates of natural biogenic and synthetic <b>colloidal</b> <b>silicas.</b> In principle, these insights should be applicable to materials {{with a wide variety of}} compositions and structural order when the reacting units are defined by the energies of their constituent species...|$|R
