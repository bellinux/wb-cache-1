40|$|Electric bicycle riders, {{particularly}} youngsters, {{are one of}} {{the high}} risk groups of road transportation system. Previous studies were limited to the causes of electric bicycle accident, and failed to explore occurrence mechanism of accidents. For a better understanding of electric bicycle rider’s unsafe crossing behavior, a questionnaire which contains TPB variables such as intention, attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control was made based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Electric bicycle rider’s unsafe crossing behavior model was established and tested by using AMOS 20. 0 which is statistical software and can verify kinds of measurement model and path analysis model through structural equation modeling (SEM). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and goodness-of-fit test indicates that TPB can well explain rider’s unsafe crossing behavior. The results show that attitude toward unsafe crossing and perceived behavioral control {{have a positive effect on}} unsafe <b>crossing</b> <b>intention,</b> while otherwise for. Perceived behavioral control and unsafe <b>crossing</b> <b>intention</b> do contribute to the prediction of unsafe crossing behavior. Available advices on the avoidance of unsafe crossing have been suggested on organizing safety education and training, increasing the traffic safety awareness of riders and strengthening law enforcement strategies...|$|R
40|$|Based on an {{extended}} Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB, Ajzen, 1985, 1991), we conducted surveys inorder {{to explain and}} predict violations at a railroad crossing, among pedestrians (n = 153) and car drivers(n = 151). Measures were made with respect to three chronologically related railroad crossing situationsthat varied in risk level. The situations were described in scenarios and depicted on photographs. Theparticipants were recruited {{in the suburbs of}} Paris, at two automated railroad crossings with four half-barriers. We found that the pedestrians had stronger <b>crossing</b> <b>intentions</b> than did car drivers, especiallyat the more congested crossing of the two under study. For both categories of road users, intentions andthe amount of intention variance explained by the extended TPB factors decreased significantly with risklevel. In the most dangerous situations, risk-taking was the most unlikely and the least predictable Self-reported past frequency of crossing against safety warning devices was the main predictor of the intentionto commit this violation again, especially among males, followed by the attitude and the injunctive normin favor the violation. Moreover, car drivers were influenced in their <b>crossing</b> <b>intentions</b> by the descriptivenorm. The presence of another vehicle on the tracks when the safety warning devices were activated wasperceived not as facilitating, but as an additional risk factor. The discussion addresses the importance oftaking into account these determinants of violations in conceiving countermeasures. Our findings couldbe especially useful for conceiving risk-communication campaigns...|$|R

This paper reports a supplementary work applying the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to identify any psychological differences toward pedestrian red light crossing between university students and their peers. Three social groups participated in the investigation. The first group is the university students in Grade one (Group 1), the other two groups are their previous senior middle school classmates who are now working full time (Group 2) or who are now out of work and school (Group 3). The statistical results indicated The TPB components accounted for 42. 9 %, 55. 3 % and 55. 4 % of the variance of red signal <b>crossing</b> <b>intention</b> for Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3 in the depicted road crossing scenario. The data also showed that there are obvious differences among the participants' responses to "refrain from crossing" between university students and others, and the subsequent regression analysis revealed the ability to "refrain from crossing" played the most important role in the intention of red light crossing in the depicted scenario...|$|R

40|$|Automated Vehicles (AV) will be {{introduced}} on public roads in the near future. This would result in automated vehicles sharing the urban space with other road users including drivers of traditional vehicles and vulnerable road users. Pedestrians might be unable to distinguish the vehicle type (traditional or automated) they are interacting with and crossing situations might become confusing, possibly leading to dangerous encounters between pedestrians and vehicles. There is currently little knowledge about the interactions between pedestrians and AVs {{from the point of}} view of the pedestrian in a real life environment. The aim of this master thesis is to determine whether pedestrians’ <b>crossing</b> <b>intentions</b> differ when interacting with automated vehicles compared to when interacting with traditional vehicles. An experiment was developed on a closed road where participants encountered a Wizard of Oz automated vehicle and a traditional vehicle in a within-subject design. In the Wizard of Oz set-up, a fake ‘driver’ sat on the driver seat while the vehicle was driven by the passenger with a joystick. Different scenarios were studied regarding vehicle appearance (‘driver’ reading a newspaper, roof signs, hood/side signs) and approach direction (left vs. right). Results showed that the majority of participants reported that the vehicle was (sometimes) driven autonomously, which indicates that the Wizard of Oz was credible. Moreover, most of the participants perceived the differences in vehicle appearance and reported to be influenced by these features. Despite of this, measurements of critical gaps and self-reported level of stress showed no significant differences between the different conditions of vehicle appearance...|$|R

40|$|Under certain circumstances, implicit, {{automatic}} learning may be attenuated by {{explicit memory}} processes. We explored the brain {{basis of this}} phenomenon in a {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) study of motor sequence learning. Using a factorial design that <b>crossed</b> subjective <b>intention</b> to learn (explicit versus implicit) with sequence difficulty (a standard versus a more complex alternating sequence), we show that explicit attempts to learn the difficult sequence produce a failure of implicit learning and, in a follow-up behavioural experiment, that this failure represents a suppression of learning itself rather than of the expression of learning. This suppression is associated with sustained right frontal activation and attenuation of learning-related changes in the medial temporal lobe and the thalamus. Furthermore, this condition is characterized by a reversal of the fronto-thalamic connectivity observed with unimpaired implicit learning. The findings demonstrate a neural basis for a well-known behavioural effect: the deleterious impact of an explicit search upon implicit learning...|$|R

40|$|Aim. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the impact, among nurses in hospital settings, of a questionnaire-based implementation <b>intentions</b> intervention on <b>notification</b> of potential ocular tissue donors to donation stakeholders. Methods. This randomized intervention was clustered at the level of hospital departments with two study arms: questionnaire-based implementation intentions intervention and control. In the intervention group, nurses were asked to plan specific actions if faced with a number of barriers when reporting potential ocular donors. The primary outcome was the potential ocular tissue donors’ notification rate before and after the intervention. Analysis was based on a generalized linear model with an identity link and a binomial distribution. Results. We compared outcomes in 26 departments from 5 hospitals, 13 departments per condition. The implementation intentions intervention did not significantly increase the notification rate of ocular tissue donors (intervention: 23. 1 % versus control: 21. 1 %; χ 2 = 1. 14, 2; P= 0. 56). Conclusion. A single and brief implementation intentions intervention among nurses did not modify the notification rate of potential ocular tissue donors to donation stakeholders. Low exposure to the intervention was a major challenge in this study. Further studies should carefully consider a multicomponent intervention to increase exposure to this type of intervention...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of E-mail-based intervention on safe crossing behaviors among Isfahan University of Medical Science students, in year 2014 in Iran. Materials and Methods: In over all, 78 boy-students with 22. 33 ± 1. 65 years were participated in an E-mail-based intervening study. They divided into intervention group (n = 38) and control group (n = 40) by use of random allocation. The instrument of data collection included questionnaire of theory of planned behavior constructs and traffic behaviors. Questionnaires were filled out by both groups at the baseline and 6 months after the educational intervention. The safe crossing educational intervention was conducted within 1 -month through E-mail service for the intervention group. The control group received no education. Results: Results showed no significant differences between groups in mean of attitude toward safe crossing, subjective norms (SNs), perceived behavioral control (PBC), <b>intention</b> and safe <b>crossing</b> behaviors at baseline (P > 0. 05).

Then the converted right-hander can simply turn his body left and face his opponent, placing him in orthodox, and follow up with an unexpected right cross. If the southpaw fighter is right-hand dominant with a strong left cross, this puts the opponent in danger of knockout from each punch in the combination, as jabs with the power hand can stun or knock out (KO) in heavier weight classes. While rare, the reverse is also true for left-handers; left-hand dominant fighters like Oscar De La Hoya and Miguel Cotto who fight from an orthodox stance give up the so-called [...] "southpaw advantage" [...] strategically, but are gifted with heavier lead hands. Consequently, in MMA if one stands in a southpaw stance (strongside forward), one must train one's cross and left low kick to make it fast, hard and dangerous.|$|R
40|$|Road intersections are {{considered}} to be serious bottlenecks of urban transportation. According to the U. S., European, and global statistics, intersection-related crashes, with fatal outcome, represent approximately 20 percent of all traffic fatalities. More than 44 % of all reported crashes in the U. S. occur within intersection areas, which, in turn, lead to 8, 500 fatalities and approximately 1 million injuries every year [1]. Furthermore, the impact of road intersections on traffic delays leads to enormous waste of human and natural resources. Statistics collected by FHWA in 2011 urban mobility report states that the average intersection delay endured by a commuter is 34 hours every year. The cost of this wasted time and related fuel consumption at intersection congestions is over $ 101 billion a year [2]. Therefore, it is critical to address these safety and throughput concerns as one of the main challenges for manual as well as autonomous driving through intersections. This dissertation studies the problem of managing traffic through intersections, and develops new decentralized, reliable and efficient active safety methods to provide safe and efficient passage through intersections and roundabouts. Our cyber-physical framework called STIP (Spatio-Temporal Intersection Protocols) incorporates a fusion of vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) communications, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V 2 I) communications and vehicle-resident sensing to enable co-operative driving of autonomous and manually-driven vehicles at intersections. The proposed system allows vehicles to traverse safely by avoiding vehicle collisions at intersections, and significantly increase traffic throughput. The STIP framework includes a family of distributed protocols and covers the following two main traffic environments, categorized based on the market penetration of autonomous vehicles: (1) Homogeneous Traffic: autonomous vehicles only, (2) Heterogeneous Traffic: mix of human-driven and autonomous vehicles. For the homogeneous traffic category, we introduce two sets of intersection protocols: (1) V 2 V-Intersection Protocols, which rely on V 2 V communications and localization to avoid vehicle collisions at intersections by controlling and navigating them within the intersection area. Autonomous vehicles approaching an intersection use DSRC to periodically broadcast information such as position, heading and intersection <b>crossing</b> <b>intentions</b> to other vehicles. The vehicles then decide among themselves regarding who crosses first, who goes next and who waits. (2) Synchronized movement-intersection protocols, which are designed to increase the parallelism at intersections by allowing the concurrent crossing of vehicles arriving from all directions. This method enforces synchronized and staggered arrival of vehicles at intersections. This method allows vehicles to cross the intersection without stopping or slowing down, and maximizes the capacity utilization of the intersection space. In case of the heterogeneous traffic category, in order to enable the safe co-existence of manually-driven and autonomous vehicles at intersections, we propose a set of communication-based and perception-based protocols, leveraging a fusion of V 2 V, V 2 I and on-board sensor systems such as cameras, radars and lidars. In this dissertation, we formally prove the deadlock-freedom property of our family of intersection protocols, and study the effects of packet loss on our V 2 V intersection protocols and measure the reliability of these protocols in the presence of channel impairments. We also measure the impact of position inaccuracy of commonly-used GPS devices on our V 2 V-intersection protocols and incorporate required modifications to guarantee their safety and efficiency despite these impairments. Additionally, we study sensor inaccuracy and occlusion’s impact on our perception-based intersection protocols, and propose simple solutions to deal with these shortcomings. The functionality of our methods is evaluated using our vehicular networks emulator-simulator, called AutoSim. Our results indicate that our proposed STIPs provide both safe passage through the intersection and significantly decrease the delay at the intersection by increasing the concurrency. Specifically, one of our V 2 V-intersection protocols yields over 87 % overall performance improvement over the common traffic light signalized intersections. Throughput increases are even more significant in the case of our synchronized movement intersection protocols, as intersection delays are reduced up to 96 % compared to the common traffic light signalized intersections, and the optimal intersection capacity utilization of 100 % is achieved in certain cases...|$|R

Five pathogenic strains (2175, 3071, 3303, 3321, 4071) identified previously from Blacksea Region were inoculated on seven foreign anthracnose resistant varieties of fresh bean (MDRK, PM, Kaboon, Widusa, Machinac, Isles and Chinook) {{as well as on}} nine breeding lines (T 23, TK 57, TK 1, Ç 31,Ç 28, T 7, T 26, TK 15 and T 21) which were developed as Ay?e kad?n type by pure-line selection, a method used for self-pollinated crops. Results indicated that while all the foreign varieties were resistant to these pathogen strains, the pure-lines were all susceptible. Thus foreign varieties and pure-lines were selected as parents to perform 63 combinations of genetic <b>cross</b> with the <b>intention</b> to start anthracnose resistance breeding program, only 18 of which produced seed. Through self fertilization of 360 F 1 plants an F 2 population of 4365 plants were obtained which were phenotyped for resistance both by inoculation with five pathogen strains as well as using resistance gene (Co- 1) linked molecular marker (SEactMcca). Since Ayse Kadin type lines are of Andean origin and Co- 1 locus controls resistance against Andean pathogens additional confirmation of Co- 1 presence in the resistant F 2 lines is of great importance. Marker screening results indicated the presence of Co- 1 gene in 6 out of 18 hybrid lines. Confirmation of resistance trait inheritance on 6 F 2 lines both by inoculations as well as molecular marker screening for Co- 1 gene have given us the opportunity to continue with the backcross studies with high confidence. With this study anthracnose resistance breeding has been initiated in Turkey {{for the first time and}} molecular marker assisted selection has been integrated into the breeding program...|$|R
