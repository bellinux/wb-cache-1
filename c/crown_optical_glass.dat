40|$|Abstract. Most {{optical glasses}} are {{in recent years}} being {{manufactured}} by diamond turning processes which has certainly modernized the field of production of optics. Confines of diamond turning for both form and surface finish accuracy have not been reached, yet. In advent of contemporary technology, high precision finishing techniques are of great concern and the need of present industrialized-scenario. This paper presents {{the development of a}} small rotary multi-jet abrasive fluid jet polishing tool for use in polishing of optical glasses. The newly designed and manufactured tool has relative angular speed with respect to the spindle of machining centre and is capable of polishing at micro levels. The paper also investigates the optimal polishing parameters for selected, <b>crown</b> <b>optical</b> <b>glass</b> based on experiments conducted using Taguchi’s experimental method. According to the possible number of control factors L 18 orthogonal array was used. ANOVA analysis was carried out to determine the main factors which would affect the surface roughness significantly. Consequently, a 2. 5 µm size of Al 2 O 3 abrasive, 10 wt % abrasive concentration, 40 rpm of polishing head rotation, 6 numbers of nozzles, 6 kg/cm 2 of fluid pressure, 45 minuet of polishing time and 40 % of step over {{have been found to be}} the optimal parameters. It was observed that about 97. 22 % improvements on surface roughness; Ra, from 0. 360 µm to 0. 010 µm has been achieved using the optimal parameters. In addition to this; rotation of polishing head, applied fluid pressure and polishing time were found to have significant effect on surface roughness improvement...|$|E

Experiments show that the single abrasive grinding cracks of <b>optical</b> <b>glass</b> is dynamic impact crack. Analyzing according to crack system, it can be generated that the impact stress in single abrasive regional is cylindrical stress. The mathematical model of single abrasive area impact stress wave is established, and the influence law of the single abrasive grinding impact area on the sub-surface crack depth is derived. According to the experimental results, the single abrasive grinding cracks {{is a kind of}} impact crack, and cylindrical stress wave mathematical model is consistent with the experiment, and the sub-surface crack depth increases in pace with the increase of chord length of impact arc.
