25|$|During encoding, 576 time-domain {{samples are}} taken and are {{transformed}} to 576 frequency-domain samples. If {{there is a}} transient, 192 samples are taken instead of 576. This is done to limit the temporal spread of quantization noise accompanying the transient. (See psychoacoustics.) Frequency resolution {{is limited by the}} small long block window size, which decreases coding efficiency. Time resolution <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> low for highly transient signals and may cause smearing of percussive sounds.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} imaging {{modality}} {{to be used}} in hybrid ORs is a C-Arm. Expert consensus rates the performance of mobile C-arms in hybrid ORs as insufficient, because the limited power of the tube impacts image quality, the field of view is smaller for image-intensifier systems than for flat-panel detector systems and the cooling system of mobile C-Arms can lead to overheating after just a few hours, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> short for lengthy surgical procedures or for multiple procedures in a row, that would be needed to recover the investment in such a room.|$|E
25|$|Where a tall cliff exists, {{a smaller}} {{structure}} may {{be placed on}} top such as at Horton Point Light. Sometimes, such a location <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> high, for example along {{the west coast of}} the United States, where frequent low clouds can obscure the light. In these cases, lighthouses are placed below clifftop to ensure that they can still be seen at the surface during periods of fog or low clouds, as at Point Reyes Lighthouse. Another victim of fog was the Old Point Loma lighthouse, which was replaced in 1891 with a lower lighthouse, New Point Loma lighthouse.|$|E
25|$|Before the 20th century, all maize {{harvesting}} was by manual labour, by grazing, or by {{some combination}} of those. Whether the ears were hand-picked and the stover was grazed, or the whole plant was cut, gathered, and shocked, people and livestock did all the work. Between the 1890s and the 1970s, the technology of maize harvesting expanded greatly. Today, all such technologies, from entirely manual harvesting to entirely mechanized, are still in use to some degree, as appropriate to each farm's needs, although the thoroughly mechanized versions predominate, as they offer the lowest unit costs when scaled to large farm operations. For small farms, their unit cost <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> high, as their higher fixed cost cannot be amortized over as many units.|$|E

500|$|Parasitoids {{are among}} the most widely used {{biological}} control agents. Commercially, {{there are two types of}} rearing systems: short-term daily output with high production of parasitoids per day, and long-term, low daily output systems. In most instances, production will need to be matched with the appropriate release dates when susceptible host species at a suitable phase of development will be available. Larger production facilities produce on a yearlong basis, whereas some facilities produce only seasonally. Rearing facilities are usually a significant distance from where the agents are to be used in the field, and transporting the parasitoids from the point of production to the point of use can pose problems. [...] Shipping conditions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> hot, and even vibrations from planes or trucks can adversely affect parasitoids.|$|E

[...] Unfortunately there is not a standard location for these screw holes, and so the add-on motor can be mounted anywhere within a two-inch range on the pillar. [...] Consequently, the belt race length can vary from the standard race lengths of the 127 and 128.

Most of the vineyards planted on the Washington side of the appellation are located on southward facing slopes along the river where they can receive some protection from the winds. Depending upon the elevation, vineyards in the Columbia Gorge AVA receive anywhere from 18-30inches (46-76 centimeters) of rain annually.|$|E
2500|$|It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> {{difficult}} {{to withdraw from}} short- or intermediate-acting benzodiazepines because of {{the intensity of the}} rebound symptoms felt between doses. Moreover, short-acting benzodiazepines appear to produce a more intense withdrawal syndrome. For this reason, discontinuation is sometimes carried out by first substituting an equivalent dose of a short-acting benzodiazepine with a longer-acting one like diazepam or chlordiazepoxide. Failure to use the correct equivalent amount can precipitate a severe withdrawal reaction. Benzodiazepines with a half-life of more than 24 hours include chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, clobazam, clonazepam, chlorazepinic acid, ketazolam, medazepam, nordazepam, and prazepam. [...] Benzodiazepines with a half-life of less than 24 hours include alprazolam, bromazepam, brotizolam, flunitrazepam, loprazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, midazolam, nitrazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam. The resultant equivalent dose is then gradually reduced. The reduction rate used in the Heather Ashton protocol calls for eliminating 10% of the remaining dose every two to four weeks, depending on the severity and response to reductions with the final dose at 0.5mg dose of diazepam or 5mg dose of chlordiazepoxide.|$|E
2500|$|In a statement, Goodell {{said that}} the NFL would not {{tolerate}} [...] "conduct or a culture" [...] that put player safety at risk.

[...] He was particularly angered that those involved had denied there was a bounty program in place. In an interview with NFL Network's Rich Eisen, Goodell said that the threat to player safety, as well as the fact the Saints lied about it, demanded significant punishment. [...] "I don't think you <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> hard on people that put at risk our players' health and safety," [...] Goodell told Eisen. He reiterated this in an interview later that day with ESPN's Schefter, saying that the fact those involved [...] "continued to mislead" [...] the league about it was a significant factor in the sanctions. [...] "You have to be accountable and responsible in the NFL," [...] Goodell said. Goodell also implied that Payton would have faced significant punishment in any event, since his contractual obligation to supervise his assistants meant that he at least should have known about the scheme. He {{also said that the}}re would be zero tolerance for payments for in-game performance in the future, saying that payments for good play eventually escalate to bounties for deliberately injuring players. Later, Schefter said on ESPN's SportsCenter that league officials felt Payton was at least as guilty as Williams, despite initial focus on Williams' role as the mastermind in the scheme.|$|E
