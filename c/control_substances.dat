2500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, experts carried out {{measurements}} protective properties of respirators in the laboratories. They used different <b>control</b> <b>substances</b> (argon, halogenated hydrocarbon vapour, aerosols of sodium chloride and oil mist, fluorophores, dioctyl phthalate, and others, and they measured their concentrations under the mask, and outside masks (simultaneously). The ratio of the measured concentrations is an indicator of the protective properties of different types of respirators. These measurements showed that if the efficiency of filters is enough high, then the gaps between the mask and the face become the main way of penetration of air contaminations under the mask.|$|E

For that reason, in basic research and clinical trials they are sometimes included in the <b>control</b> <b>substances</b> {{in order to minimize}} confounding, reflecting that otherwise, the absence of the active ingredient would not be the only variable involved, because absence of excipient cannot always be assumed not to be a variable.

The following day new legislation was introduced reinstating the ban on the previously legalised drugs. However, owing to technical reasons the ban could not come into law until the following day. Consequently, for one day (eleventh of March 2015) many headshop type drugs and an assortment of other synthetic drugs including amphetamine, MDMA, Khat and ketamine were legal to possess in Ireland.|$|E

The respirator's PF may change dozens of times during of several minutes; and the two average PF (that were measured for the same worker in one day; for example - before and after the lunch break) can differ by more than 12 000 times.|$|E

40|$|This study {{screened}} {{the available}} evidence for the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of propolis, a natural herbal resin bee product, against a selection of three bacterial species of relevance to oral diseases. For this purpose, papers dealing with laboratory studies assessing minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) or the agar diffusion method to analyze the antimicrobial properties of propolis on three oral pathogens (S. mutans, P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum) and a yeast (C. albicans) are reviewed. Overall, a positive antimicrobial effect could be shown. However, {{when compared to the}} commonly used <b>control</b> <b>substances</b> (e. g., specific antibiotics, antiseptics and antifungals), propolis appeared less effective, depending on the bacterial strain, and required higher concentrations than the <b>control</b> <b>substances,</b> in order to show a measurable effect.
