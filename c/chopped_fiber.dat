40|$|Abstract. <b>Chopped</b> <b>fiber</b> and {{a hybrid}} {{reinforcement}} of chopped and continuous fibers {{were used for}} fabricating SiC/SiC composites. Under the selected sintering pressure, the composite sintered at lower temperature (1820 °C) had lower density.

However, pores still existed and mainly distributed in the areas the fibers accumulated, especially inside of the fiber bundles. Densely sintered matrix still could be found in the composite sintered at 1820 °C, 15 MPa. In the areas with the fibers accumulated, matrix was relatively weak so that the cracks were easily propagated leading to the delamination during bending test. When continuous fiber was included into the <b>chopped</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced composite, a hybrid reinforcing mechanism was obtained. This kind of composite had obviously improved toughness and strength. On the fracture surface, the pulled out fibers that were perpendicular to the fracture surface were increased...|$|E
