25|$|According to Baker, {{the plea}} deal could allow Wilson to be {{eligible}} for First Offender Treatment, which would mean that he would not have a criminal record nor would he be subject to registering on the sex offender registry once his sentence had been completed. It <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> Wilson receiving a reduced sentence, possibly leading to his release based upon time already served. Wilson's lawyer, B.J.

25|$|In June 2008, {{only days}} after CSKA won its 31st title, UEFA {{notified}} the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) that the club would {{not receive a}} license for participating in the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League because of unpaid obligations. The BFU then speculated this <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> CSKA {{not being able to}} take part in the domestic championship, effectively turning it into an amateur club. Attempts to arrange a settlement with UEFA proved unsuccessful and CSKA lost its right to compete in the Champions League in favor of runners-up Levski Sofia.

5000|$|The most {{effective}} sink of atmospheric methane is the hydroxyl radical in the troposphere, or the lowest portion of Earth’s atmosphere. As methane rises into the air, it reacts with the hydroxyl radical to create water vapor and carbon dioxide. The lifespan of methane {{in the atmosphere}} was estimated at 9.6 years as of 2001; however, increasing emissions of methane over time reduce the concentration of the hydroxyl radical in the atmosphere.

50|$|Igbo historians such as Emeka Esogbue (of Ibusa origin) and C. N. Ugochukwu (Nnewi origin) {{share the}} opinion that groups who left Benin with Ezechima and journeyed Eastward might have settled in Igbuzo {{considering}} the geographical location of the town. The implication of this therefore is that this new set of settlers could have been sick or generally lacking in interest in furthering their journey, this <b>could</b> <b>also</b> have <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> their final settlement in not too distant Onitsha. This new group of settlers in Igbuzo might have become assimilated by the Umejei and Edini groups.|$|R
25|$|While {{the backs}} prepare {{to receive a}} kick, the other {{defenders}} will attempt to apply pressure to the kicker. It is usually rather predictable when a side is about to kick: normally {{one member of the}} attacking team is in charge of kicking, and as the team prepares to kick, he will drop back and make himself available deep behind the dummy half, to give himself space and time to set up for the kick. To limit the kicker's effectiveness, the defenders will often rush up out of the defensive line towards him. As well as giving him less time to set up, this action can cloud the kicker's mind, distracting him with thoughts of the upcoming tackle or encouraging him to consider switching to another attacking option due to the sudden change in the defensive line. This combination of physical and mental pressure may lead to a poor kick, giving an advantage to the non-kicking team. This manoeuvre <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> a 'charge-down', if a defending player manages {{to get in the way}} of the ball very shortly after it is kicked (If the ball travels forward this is an exception to the knock-on rule). This often results in a line break or try to the previously defending team, however it runs the risk of having the attacking team regather the ball for a new set of tackles.|$|E

50|$|High {{concentrations}} of petroleum products <b>in</b> soil can <b>result</b> <b>in</b> high soil heating values. Heat released from soils can <b>result</b> <b>in</b> overheating and {{damage to the}} desorber. Soils with heating values greater than 2,000 Btu/lb require blending with cleaner soils to dilute the high concentration of hydrocarbons. High hydrocarbon concentrations in the offgas may exceed the thermal capacity of the afterburner and potentially <b>result</b> <b>in</b> the release of untreated vapors into the atmosphere. Excessive constituent levels <b>in</b> soil <b>could</b> <b>also</b> potentially <b>result</b> <b>in</b> the generation of vapors in the desorber at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit (LEL).

50|$|Due to {{a declining}} labor {{participation}} rate, there {{is expected to}} be a shortage of workers in the U.S. workforce. Projections show that the demand for labor needed now is not being fulfilled, and the gap between labor needed and labor available will continue to expand over the future. Owing to the differences in population size between the Baby Boomers and the following younger generations, there has been negative growth in the working age population. The retirement of members of the aging workforce <b>could</b> <b>also</b> possibly <b>result</b> <b>in</b> shortages of skilled labor. A majority of experienced utility workers and hospital caregivers, for example, will be eligible for retirement.|$|R

30|$|The grain (3200  kg ha− 1) and biomass (7472  kg ha− 1) yields {{obtained}} from the control treatment were inferior. Applications of RNP from FYM or compost and their combinations <b>could</b> not <b>also</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> higher grain and biomass yields of malting barley due, possibly, {{to the fact that}} the nutrients especially N and P were not immediately available during the season to fully nourish the crop. Hence, under low soil fertility condition, integrated application of organic and mineral fertilizers is highly required because of their additive effects (Agegnehu et al. 2016 a; Liu et al. 2012). Zahir and Mian (2006) reported that plots, which received N solely from FYM produced significantly lowest grain yield compared to other fertilizer treatments.|$|R
30|$|Generally, the {{temperature}} profiles {{obtained in the}} composting experiments showed a short initial mesophilic stage before attaining thermophilic temperatures. The themophilic stage was very short and followed by rapid cooling period (Figures  1 and 2). Failure to stay hot might be attributed to {{various factors such as}} excessively high moisture levels in some cases, low ambient temperature and excessive cooling due to small size of the compost piles. The recalcitrant nature of the composting substrate <b>could</b> <b>also</b> have <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> slow generation of heat in comparison to losses to the surroundings. High temperatures are necessary for effective composting (de Bertoldi et al. 1983). Respiration of micro-organisms decomposing the organic substrate is responsible for the generation of heat (Garcia-Gomez et al. 2002; Adediran et al. 2003).|$|R

40|$|Biofilms on biocathodes can {{catalyze}} the cathodic oxygen {{reduction and}} accordingly guarantee high cathode redox potentials. The present research assessed {{the use of}} biocathodes in full-sediment microbial fuel cells. Carbon felt-based biocathodes were evaluated in freshwater systems, and an extension of their application to brackish systems and/or stainless steel webs as base material was considered. Efficient biocathodes could be developed within days through inoculation with active microorganisms. Carbon felt was found most suited for the biocathodes in freshwater with increased performance at salinities around 80 - 250 mM. Maximum long-term performance reached 12. 3 A mu W cm - 2 cathode. The relative benefit of stainless steel seemed to increase with increasing salinity.

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{a strong}} {{maternal}} parent-of-origin effect in determining susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS). One hypothesis is that an abnormal intrauterine milieu leading to impaired fetal development <b>could</b> plausibly <b>also</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> increased susceptibility to MS. A possible marker for this intrauterine insult {{is the presence of}} a non-fatal congenital anomaly. Methods We investigated whether or not congenital anomalies are associated with MS in a population-based cohort. We identified 7063 MS index cases and 2655 spousal controls with congenital anomaly information from the Canadian Collaborative Project on Genetic Susceptibility to MS (CCPGSMS). Results The frequency of congential anomalies were compared between index cases and controls. No significant differences were found. Conclusions Congenital anomalies thus {{do not appear to be}} associated with MS. However, we did not have complete data on types and severity of congenital anomalies or on maternal birth history and thus this study should be regarded as preliminary. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} colonies imported more slaves, initially from established English {{colonies in}} the West Indies. Like them, the mainland colonies rapidly increased restrictions that defined slavery as a racial caste associated with African ethnicity. In 1663 Virginia (followed by others) adopted the principle in slave law of partus sequitur ventrem: that {{children were born}} into the status of their mother, rather than taking the status of their father, as was then customary for English subjects under English common law. This meant that children of slave mothers were also slaves, regardless of their fathers and ethnicity. In some cases, this <b>also</b> <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> a person being legally white under Virginia law of the time, although born into slavery.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the most current}} nationally representative data on inpatient care in the United States. Data are from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS), the longest continuously running nationally representative survey of hospital utilization. The figure on the right presents data on the hospitalization rate for four age groups over the past 30 years. The rate of hospitalization for the elderly (those 65 years and over) increased by 23 percent over the entire period, despite a decrease during the 1980 s. The rates for the other age groups declined overall, especially during the 1980 s. Many advances in medical care (including cardiovascular interventions and drug therapies) occurred during this time, which may have decreased death rates but <b>could</b> <b>also</b> have <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> a heightened risk of hospitalization for the elderly. The elderly comprised 20 percent of the hospital discharges and used {{a third of the}} days of care in 1970; in the year 2000 they made up close to 40 percent of the discharges and used almost one-half of the hospital days.
