For the 1998 model year, only the TDI <b>compression-ignition</b> <b>engine</b> was turbocharged; the spark-ignition engines were only naturally aspirated. In June 1999, Volkswagen introduced the 1.8T, which was the first turbocharged spark-ignition engine offered for the New Beetle. Volkswagen created a web site dedicated specifically to the 1.8T.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{properties}} {{and application of}} di-methyl ether (DME) as a candidate fuel for <b>compression-ignition</b> <b>engines.</b> DME is produced by the conversion of various feedstock such as natural gas, coal, oil residues and bio-mass. To determine the technical feasibility of DME, the review compares its key properties with those of diesel fuel {{that are relevant to}} this application. DME’s diesel engine-compatible properties are its high cetane number and low auto-ignition temperature. In addition, its simple chemical structure and high oxygen content result in soot-free combustion in engines. Fuel injection of DME can be achieved through both conventional mechanical and current common-rail systems but requires slight modification of the standard system to prevent corrosion and overcome low lubricity. The spray characteristics of DME enable its application to <b>compression-ignition</b> <b>engines</b> despite some differences in its properties such as easier evaporation and lower density. Overall, the low particulate matter production of DME provides adequate justification for its consideration as a candidate fuel in <b>compression-ignition</b> <b>engines.</b> Recent research and development shows comparable output performance to a diesel fuel led engine but with lower particulate emissions. NOx emissions from DME-fuelled engines can meet future regulations with high exhaust gas recirculation in combination with a lean NOx trap. Although more development work has focused on medium or heavy-duty engines, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the technical feasibility of DME as a candidate fuel for environmentally-friendly <b>compression-ignition</b> <b>engines</b> independent of size or application...|$|R

Different orientations and staging of the jets with respect to each other are now being simulated.

50|$|Diesel fuel flash points vary between 52 and 96 C. Diesel is {{suitable}} {{for use in a}} <b>compression-ignition</b> <b>engine.</b> Air is compressed until it has been heated above the autoignition temperature of the fuel, which is then injected as a high-pressure spray, keeping the fuel-air mix within flammable limits. In a diesel-fueled engine, there is no ignition source (such as the spark plugs in a gasoline engine). Consequently, diesel fuel must have a high flash point and a low autoignition temperature.|$|E

40|$|The cost in mean {{effective}} pressure of generating air flow in the combustion chambers of single-cylinder <b>compression-ignition</b> <b>engines</b> was determined for the prechamber and the displaced-piston types of combustion chamber. For each type {{a wide range of}} air-flow quantities, speeds, and boost pressures was investigated. Supplementary tests were made to determine the effect of lubricating-oil temperature, cooling-water temperature, and compression ratio on the friction mean {{effective pressure}} of the single-cylinder test engine. Friction curves are included for two 9 -cylinder, radial, <b>compression-ignition</b> aircraft <b>engines.</b> The results indicate that generating the optimum forced air flow increased the motoring losses approximately 5 pounds per square inch {{mean effective pressure}} regardless of chamber type or engine speed. With a given type of chamber, the rate of increase in friction mean effective pressure with engine speed is independent of the air-flow speed. The effect of boost pressure on the friction cannot be predicted because the friction was decreased, unchanged, or increased depending on the combustion-chamber type and design details. High compression ratio accounts for approximately 5 pounds per square inch mean effective pressure of the friction of these single-cylinder <b>compression-ignition</b> <b>engines.</b> The single-cylinder test engines used in this investigation had a much higher friction mean effective pressure than conventional aircraft engines or than the 9 -cylinder, radial, <b>compression-ignition</b> <b>engines</b> tested so that performance should be compared on an indicated basis...|$|R

However the airblast method {{was the only}} capable technique for introducing and vaporizing heavier fuel in the cylinder until diesel injection systems were developed by Bosch, and although similar in mechanism to modern diesel injection system the fuel delivery system in hot oil engines did not vaporize oil so in essence Rudolph Diesel's solution is the forerunner of modern diesel engines where fuel is vaporized as well as pressurized by the fuel delivery system and not by thermal vaporization in an internal hot chamber.|$|E
