5000|$|In the law, a {{proximate}} cause {{is an event}} sufficiently related to a legally recognizable injury to be held to {{be the cause of}} that injury. There are two types of causation in the law: <b>cause-in-fact,</b> and proximate (or legal) cause. <b>Cause-in-fact</b> is determined by the [...] "but for" [...] test: But for the action, the result would not have happened. For example, but for running the red light, the collision would not have occurred. The action is a necessary condition, but may not be a sufficient condition, for the resulting injury. For an act to cause a harm, both tests must be met; {{proximate cause}} is a legal limitation on <b>cause-in-fact.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Court {{held that}} the law {{considers}} causation as a hybrid between two constituent parts: actual cause, or <b>cause-in-fact,</b> and legal cause, which {{is also known as}} proximate cause. Because the <b>cause-in-fact</b> requirement was not met in this case, the Court did not rule on whether the crime of distribution of drugs causing death required a foreseeability or proximate cause requirement. Instead, the Court focused on the specific text found in , the federal law requiring heightened sentences for drug sales causing death or serious bodily injury. The language in that statute requires that the death “results from” the sale of illegal drugs. Because the deceased in this case was found with multiple drugs in his system, the heroin sold by the defendant could not be considered an independently sufficient cause of death.|$|E
5000|$|Actual cause (also called [...] "cause-in-fact") {{holds that}} the {{defendant}} cannot be criminally liable unless it can be shown {{that he was the}} <b>cause-in-fact</b> of the prohibited result.

40|$|This paper {{takes it}} as a premise that a {{distinction}} between matters of fact and of law {{is important in the}} causal inquiry. But it argues that separating factual and legal causation as different elements of liability is not the best way to implement the fact/law distinction. What counts as a <b>cause-in-fact</b> is partly a legal question; and certain liability-limiting doctrines under the umbrella of “legal causation” depend on the application of factual-causal concepts. The contrastive account of factual causation proposed in this paper improves matters. This account more clearly distinguishes matters of fact from matters of law within the <b>cause-in-fact</b> inquiry. It also extends the scope of <b>cause-in-fact</b> to answer some questions currently answered by certain doctrines of legal causation—doctrines that, it is argued, are more naturally seen as applications of our ordinary causal concept than as noncausal liability-limiting devices...|$|E
40|$|A {{product claim}} based on breach of express warranty, {{tortious}} misrepresentation, or inadequate directions or warnings, requires the plaintiff to show {{not only that}} the product was defective and was the cause of his injury, but usually he must also show that he was aware of the defective representation. Proof of such awareness if not required when defects arise from the failure of a product to meet ordinary expectations, since these expectations are presumed. Where the defect consists of a representation, however, special expectations are supposed to be involved, and the plaintiff, in order to recover, may therefore be required to show his awareness of the misrepresentation. Proof of such awareness is thought necessary to establish <b>cause-in-fact.</b> <b>Cause-in-fact,</b> however, is not a fixed quantum in every case, but may vary according to the policy considerations involved in the particular circumstances of each case. This article 2 ̆ 7 s thesis is that concern for proof of causation based on awareness should play a lesser role in representational defect cases than the courts usually accord the matter, because of countervailing policy considerations that minimize its importance. If the issue is considered at all, it should usually be a jury question rather than one of law for the court...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse two {{ways in which}} {{liability}} can be reduced: caps (the "judgment proof problem"), and proportional reductions (the "disappearing defendant problem"). We show that these two problems have different incentive effects and hence yield dissimilar levels of social welfare. Moreover, when they occur simultaneously they may have offsetting effects. We also show that the negligence rule with <b>cause-in-fact</b> may yield lower (rather than higher) levels of social welfare than strict liability. Finally, we analyse the optimal setting of the negligence standard. Our model encompasses different precaution technologies as well as monetary "v". non-monetary precautions.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{proximate}} cause standard the court adopted in Osborne. It offers a slightly different standard for resolving proximate cause issues {{that is consistent with}} Osborne, but more clearly separates proximate cause into causation and legal limits components. The real problem will not be with the application of the substantial factor test. Given the baggage the test carries, a move away from that standard to the simpler but-for standard is not likely to occur, but understanding that {{the other part of the}} substantial factor test – the scope of liability issue – is distinct from the <b>cause-in-fact</b> issue, will permit a clearer focus on the essential issue that has to be answered, which is whether a bar’s responsibility should extend to the kind of injury that ultimately occurred...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{explores the}} {{response}} of the legal system to the uncertainty which is inherent in the scientific analysis of environmental impact. The first principle of due process is that the assignment of responsibility correspond with the actor who did in fact cause the injury. We argue that existing concepts of <b>cause-in-fact,</b> the foundation of liability, place potentially severe constraints on the ability of the legal system to respond to the need to minimize the risks of future environmental injury. Further, these constraints exist to some degree regardless of whether the prohibitions or restrictions take the form of adjudication, administrative rulemaking or legislation. In any of these contexts a court or agency applying a standard or reviewing a regulation may respond to the claim that an activity should not be allowed because of its potential future adverse impact by deciding that it would be speculative to conclude that the activity might cause harm, or that the party seeking to assign responsibility has merely established a possibility rather than a probability of such impact. In short, an essential element of responsibility—cause-in-fact—may not have been established...|$|E
40|$|Judges have a {{tendency}} to be more demanding than regulators. In the United States, a majority of the courts has adopted the rule that the unexcused violation of a statutory standard is negligence per se. However, the converse does not hold: compliance with regulation does not relieve the injurer of tort liability. In most European legal systems, the outcome is similar. We use a framework in which, on the one hand, the effects of tort law are undermined by insolvency and evidence problems and, on the other hand, regulation is expensive in terms of monitoring and information gathering. We show that a regulatory standard set below the socially optimal level of care can be sufficient to remove the shortcomings of tort law. In essence, this is because the injurer’s cost function may have two local minima that make only major deviations from the socially desirable level of precaution advantageous for the injurer, but not minor violations. This may occur when precaution also or only reduces the magnitude of the harm and under liability for negligence. Thus, minimum regulation can completely restore optimal liability incentives. Conversely, liability reduces the cost of enforcing regulation in two ways: first, enforcing minimum regulation rather than a standard set at the socially optimal level is cheaper because it requires lower monitoring levels; second, tort liability already provides a part of the sanction for sub-optimal behavior, thus allowing for a further reduction in monitoring. Moreover, we show that minimum regulation {{does not need to be}} set at a very precise level. On the contrary, any level within a certain range is socially optimal. This allows regulators to further curb their cost by saving on information gathering. We show that an imperfectly working tort system can be fully corrected by minimum regulation in a variety of circumstances (for instance, even if the injurer is unable to compensate for the harm at the optimal level of precaution, and even if the rule in force is strict liability or a <b>cause-in-fact</b> variant of negligence) ...|$|E
40|$|Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle {{is among}} the most important, and least discussed, cases in {{constitutional}} tort law. It stands for the abstract principle that the 2 ̆ 2 but-for 2 ̆ 2 rule of causation, which is the usual test in common-law torts, applies in constitutional torts as well. Doyle, a nontenured school teacher, quarreled with another teacher, with school employees, and with students. Two specific incidents deserve mention. First, on one occasion he 2 ̆ 2 made an obscene gesture to two girls in connection with their failure to obey commands made in his capacity as cafeteria supervisor. 2 ̆ 2 Second, after the principal circulated a memorandum on a teacher dress code, he called a local radio station to criticize the administration. 2 ̆ 2 [C]iting 2 ̆ 7 a notable lack of tact in handling professional matters which le[ft] much doubt as to [his] sincerity in establishing good school relationships, 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 and giving the radio station incident and the obscene gesture incident as examples, the school district declined to offer him a contract for the next school year. Doyle sued under 42 U. S. C. § 1983, which authorizes victims of constitutional violations to sue for damages or injunctive relief. Though Doyle was able to show that protected speech played a part in the decision, a unanimous Court held that he could not recover damages for the discharge if the government could prove that he would have been fired anyway, for constitutionally permissible reasons. Otherwise, Doyle would be 2 ̆ 2 in a better position {{as a result of the}} exercise of constitutionally protected conduct than he would have occupied had he done nothing. 2 ̆ 2 The Court adopted a two-part test for causation in mixed motive cases. First, the plaintiff must show that the 2 ̆ 2 conduct was constitutionally protected, and that his conduct was a 2 ̆ 7 substantial factor 2 ̆ 7 [...] or, to put it in other words, that it was a 2 ̆ 7 motivating factor 2 ̆ 7 in the Board 2 ̆ 7 s decision. Once the plaintiff meets the substantial factor test, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to show 2 ̆ 2 by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision [...] . even in the absence of the protected conduct. 2 ̆ 2 The Court 2 ̆ 7 s rule is a variant of the but-for test that governs most <b>cause-in-fact</b> issues in the common law of torts, differing only in its allocation of the burden of proof. Unlike the issue of whether speech is protected by the First Amendment, which is a question of law for the court, the causation issue is for the jury, subject to the customary judicial oversight for reasonableness. This Article argues that Mt. Healthy was wrongly decided and therefore should not be applied either in determining liability or in assessing damages. It should be replaced by a rule that allows the plaintiff to recover full damages whenever the constitutional violation was sufficient to cause them. Part II focuses on the role of causation in tort law. Examining Mt. Healthy from the perspective of general tort theory, I argue that the ruling is at odds with the fairness and deterrence goals of tort law. Part III shifts to the special features of the constitutional tort context. Quite apart from the general principles of tort law, the special role of constitutional tort law as part of the system of constitutional remedies justifies a more plaintiff-friendly causation rule for constitutional torts. In Part IV, I return to the First Amendment origins of Mt. Healthy and argue that certain distinctive features of retaliation cases, in particular the fragility of First Amendment rights, justify a special sufficient cause rule in this context, even if such a rule were rejected for other constitutional claims. Notice that, while the narrow focus of Part IV is the First Amendment retaliation doctrine, the rest of the analysis is relevant across the whole range of constitutional tort suits...|$|E
