25|$|Modern EMSs read in {{data from}} various sensors about the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position,</b> intake {{manifold}} temperature, {{intake manifold pressure}} (or intake air volume), throttle position, fuel mixture via the oxygen sensor, detonation via a knock sensor, and exhaust gas temperature sensors. The EMS then uses the collected data to precisely determine how much fuel to deliver and when and how far to advance the ignition timing. With electronic ignition systems, individual cylinders can have their own individual timing so that timing can be as aggressive as possible per cylinder without fuel detonation. As a result, sophisticated electronic ignition systems can be both more fuel efficient, and produce better performance over their counterparts.|$|E

The measured pressure depends on the <b>crankshaft’s</b> <b>position.</b> Is used a pressure transducer with strain-gauge socket, and measurement of the <b>crankshaft’s</b> <b>position</b> with a speed transducer with variable reluctance. From experimental data, on one hand, can be analyzed the pressure modification in the combustion chamber depending on the <b>crankshaft’s</b> <b>position,</b> {{and on the other}} hand, the maximum pressure modification in the cylinder depending on the speed...|$|R
5000|$|... 2002 {{and earlier}} engines {{featured}} a one-piece cast nodular iron crankshaft with counterweights present {{on either side}} of each crank pin. A crankshaft tone wheel was present between number 1 and number 2 connecting rod pins, and was machined such that a Hall-effect magnetic pickup mounted to the engine block could read the <b>crankshaft's</b> <b>position</b> as it rotates. 2003 and later engines switched to a two-piece crankshaft. The tone wheel was re-engineered to attach to the crankshaft using three bolts, had a tone pattern substantially different from previous engines, and was moved {{to the rear of the}} crankshaft. For this reason, these engines are generally not interchangeable between the 2002- and 2003+ model years.|$|R
40|$|Abstract − Coordinate {{measuring}} {{machines in}} various branches of industry within last years became very common. Measuring machines {{can be used}} e. g. for direct determination of correction values for machine tools in production cycle. In the paper a description of closed loop of machine tool and coordinate measuring machine was given. Thus CMM generates a correction file with data including <b>crankshaft</b> geometry. <b>Position</b> of <b>crankshaft</b> during measurements was analyzed and holder for crankshaft was designed and made.

50|$|The {{easiest way}} to {{differentiate}} a bare Magnum block from a LA is by checking {{for the presence of}} the two <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> sensor mounting bosses on the right rear top of the block, just {{to the rear of the}} cylinder head deck surface. Bosses = Magnum.|$|E
50|$|The {{ignition}} timing {{will need to}} become increasingly advanced (relative to TDC) as the engine speed increases so that the air-fuel mixture has the correct {{amount of time to}} fully burn. As the engine speed (RPM) increases, the time available to burn the mixture decreases but the burning itself proceeds at the same speed, it needs to be started increasingly earlier to complete in time. Poor volumetric efficiency at higher engine speeds also requires increased advancement of {{ignition timing}}. The correct timing advance for a given engine speed will allow for maximum cylinder pressure to be achieved at the correct <b>crankshaft</b> angular <b>position.</b> When setting the timing for an automobile engine, the factory timing setting can usually be found on a sticker in the engine bay.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, an Electronic Helical Guide Controller (EHGC) is proposed, for {{helical gear}} shaping processes. In most {{traditional}} gear shaper machines, the cutter's reciprocating movement {{is driven by}} a crank-connecting rod mechanism. Therefore, this study adopts this kind of gear shaper as the machine platform to establish an accurate mathematical model. The control algorithm {{is embedded in the}} interpolation module of the CNC system using electronic gearbox techniques to realize special multi-axis linkage control requirements. The <b>crankshaft's</b> angular <b>position</b> is measured and the rotational speed is calculated in each control cycle. The actual position and velocity of the cutter along the Z-axis can be calculated using the geometric relations of the crank-connecting mechanism, and motion in the other axes can be controlled by the electronic gearbox. A special G code with parameters (G 83) is also designed and the EHGC control through NC programming is realized in an improvised gear shaping CNC machine. The proposed EHGC is low cost and easy to implement in practice since it does not need a linear grating ruler and a probe on the Z-axis. Furthermore, EHGC allows the flexibility to change a part's helix angle to compensate for distortions caused by heat treatment. Simulations and experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed EHGC...|$|R
50|$|One area {{in which}} VR sensors excel, however, is in {{high-temperature}} applications. Because operating temperature {{is limited by the}} characteristics of the materials used in the device, with appropriate construction VR sensors can be made to operate at temperatures in excess of 300°C.

The <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> sensor is sensing {{the movement of}} two radially opposed position plates on the flywheel, {{one of which is}} magnetized, and the other is not.

40|$|A {{crankcase}} is {{the lower}} part of engine which in single cylinder two-stroke engine the main function is to hold the <b>crankshaft</b> in parallel <b>position</b> and work as a vacuum medium to suck the combustion material.

40|$|The {{methods for}} {{analysis}} of angular acceleration of pressure and vibration signals {{presented in this paper}} have the advantage of non-contacting signal acquisition and of simple methods for signal processing and feature extraction. The analysis of angular acceleration provides a high sensitivity for the detection of a number of mechanical faults and of faults in the combustion process. It is well suited for the detection of misfiring. In this paper only global features defined over whole working cycles were used. By extracting features from sections of the working cycle a cylinder-specific recognition of misfunctions is feasible. Again statistical methods are well suited. The acceleration signal is a good starting point for the detection of malfunctions, but for the differentiation between several possible causes additional faultspecific methods have to be applied. A wide range of diagnostic methods is known and applied in automotive industry. Generally the exploitation of pressure and vibration signals for diagnostic purposes can be ameliorated. These signals are helpful e. g. in the recognition of faulty valve clearance, of valve leakage and of mechanical faults at injection nozzles. Valve leakage and faults at injection nozzles are factors which also influence the angular acceleration. Therefore methods for the recognition of these faults only were decribed. They have in common a processing strategy based on synchronization to the <b>crankshaft's</b> angular <b>position.</b> Synchronous averaging of signals results in noise reduction for the recognition of fine details. The replacement of comblicated static leakage tests by features derived from pressure sensors brings the advantage of simplified tests with acquisition of statistical variances...|$|R

50|$|As of the 2013 model year, the 4.3L {{was still}} in {{production}} although the distributor was eliminated in the late 2000s where a coil-on-plug ignition system (using a 58x <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> sensor based on the GEN IV LSx) was phased in. This resulted in a new design timing cover with a wider bottom flange, making it incompatible with the 1996-06 LU3/L35.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the applicability of hydrogen as a fuel for compression ignition engines. The research indicates that hydrogen is a suitable fuel for “compression ignition” (CI) engines, “fumigated diesel” (FD), “homogeneous charge compression ignition” (HCCI) and “direct injection of hydrogen” (DIH 2). Peculiarities of the various modes of operation with hydrogen were investigated using a high speed commercial direct injection diesel engine, Deutz 1 FL 511 with a compression ratio of 17 : 1, as well as a simulation model to assist with on the understanding of certain phenomena that were impossible to reproduce due to the engine and transducers physical limitations. Instrumentation with high-speed data acquisition was designed and installed to measure <b>crankshaft</b> speed and <b>position,</b> airflow rate, inlet air pressure and temperature, fuel consumption, brake power, cylinder combustion pressure, and exhaust gas temperature. The design, construction and characterization of a pulse controlled hydrogen injection system for HCCI and DIH 2 was carried out and discussed. In this research, special attention was paid to characterize and identify the operating parameters that control the hydrogen combustion in a CI engine. High rates of engine cylinder pressure rise were found when using hydrogen and some form of control solution is required. Simulation and engine tests were carried out to characterize and identify new design approaches to control such high rates of pressure rise, culminating in the proposal of a pulsed injection methodology, and also the use of the Miller cycle to mitigate the observed high rates of pressure rise. A number of possible iv innovative solutions and measures, making the hydrogen engine operation reliable and safe are also presented. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Recently, lots of {{improvement}} in design structure {{has been made}} through experiments and experience of engineers. This process is wasteful {{in terms of time}} consumption, expenses and resources, especially when considering the trend towards reducing weight in manufacturing products. Hence, {{it is important to understand}} well the dynamic characteristics of the products precisely before production commences. One of the steps in understanding the characteristics is to conduct the sensitivity analysis which requires a numerical skill for the optimum design. Besides that, the sensitivity analysis may predict the influence of some effects on the total structure system due to the modification of the design. For instance, Nelson[1] presented a direct method of sensitivity analysis, which is found splendidly practical by many researchers. Mills-Curran[2] had investigated the possibility of iterative eigenvalue application. However, in practical use, this method has a problem. Rudisill[3] determined the change rates for the first eigenvalue and eigenvector. The change rates for the second eigenvalue were also determined. Fox and Kapoor[4] linear combination for non-modified structure amount of changes of an eigenvector and determined the sensitivity coefficient from the normalised mass and orthogonal condition and calculated the change rates for the first eigenvector. Wang[5] applied mode summation technique of accelerated mode on the sensitivity analysis and improved the estimation accuracy. Min, Hyun-Gi et. al. [6] used direct differential method and studied the kinematics of an automobile suspension system with the sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis methods explained above are widely used by most of the researchers; however none of them considered the sensitivity analysis can determine the location of the modification and the modified value, but the analysis itself is a key problem. Once the modifications are made, the structure correspondently changes the natural frequency and the result may not be the optimum value. For instance, if we intend to change the original structure but with less modified points and less subsequent on the dynamic parameters in achieving the desired value, what should we do? To overcome such problems, a sensitivity analysis method by determining the most sensitive point, direction of parameter change and modified value for modification was proposed. Besides that, the sensitivity method in determining natural frequency using partial differential equation is derived with respect to physical parameter to calculate the structure modification. The method is applied to the 3 degrees of freedom lumped mass model by modelling the mass and stiffness and applies the method to a real <b>crankshaft</b> system. The <b>position,</b> direction of parameter change and modified value is predicted for modification of the crankshaft system and the result is used to investigate the magnitude of vibration level. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{functional}} objective for the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> sensor is {{to determine}} the position and/or rotational speed (RPM) of the crank. Engine Control Units use the information transmitted by the sensor to control parameters such as ignition timing and fuel injection timing. In a diesel the sensor will control the fuel injection. The sensor output may also be related to other sensor data including the cam position to derive the current combustion cycle, this is very important for the starting of a four stroke engine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> {{and speed}} are {{determined}} by input signals generated by poles in a magnetic reluctance disc. The system may be run in either open-loop or closed-loop mode (with the latter requiring a lambda sensor). Additional features include an engine speed limiter, overrun fuel cut-off, startup fuel enrichment (both during cranking and after startup), and fueling compensation for battery voltage. Some operating parameters are learned by the ECU over time, such as the optimal IAC valve position for a stable idle. This accommodates slight differences in engine wear and tune between different engines.|$|E
50|$|Most engine {{systems have}} {{idle speed control}} built into the ECU. The engine RPM is {{monitored}} by the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> sensor which plays a primary role in the engine timing functions for fuel injection, spark events, and valve timing. Idle speed is controlled by a programmable throttle stop or an idle air bypass control stepper motor. Early carburetor-based systems used a programmable throttle stop using a bidirectional DC motor. Early Throttle body injection (TBI) systems used an idle air control stepper motor. Effective idle speed control must anticipate the engine load at idle.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes, {{the sensor}} may become burnt or worn out - or just die {{of old age}} at high mileage. One likely cause of <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> sensor failure is {{exposure}} to extreme heat. Others are vibration causing a wire to fracture or corrosion on the pins of harness connectors. Many modern crankshaft sensors are sealed units and therefore will not be damaged by water or other fluids. When it goes wrong, it stops transmitting the signal which contains the vital data for the ignition and other parts in the system.|$|E
5000|$|Data {{representing}} {{the amount of}} power output desired by the driver (sometimes known as [...] "engine load") is also used by the engine control unit in calculating the amount of fuel required. A throttle position sensor (TPS) provides this information. Other engine sensors used in EFI systems include a coolant temperature sensor, a camshaft or <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> sensor (some systems get the position information from the distributor), and an oxygen sensor which is installed in the exhaust system {{so that it can}} be used to determine how well the fuel has been combusted, therefore allowing closed loop operation.|$|E
50|$|AMC-Renault uses a fully {{integrated}} {{electronic engine control}} system made by RenixThe Renix electronic ignition system consists of a solid-state Ignition Control Module (ICM), a distributor, a <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> sensor, and an Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The Renix ECU has a powerful microprocessor that was advanced technology for its time. It also incorporates an engine knocking sensor that allows the computer to know if detonation is occurring, thus allowing the computer to make adaptive control by individual cylinder corrections to prevent pinging. The knock detection uses the signal from a wide bank accelerometer mounted on the cylinder head. Good {{signal to noise ratio}} is obtained primarily through angular discrimination.|$|E

Output was [...] and [...] The Toronado version of the 1977 Oldsmobile 403 engine was fitted with a crank triggered ignition system. Parts peculiar to this system include a toothed disc between the harmonic balancer and the crank pulley, the adjacent sensor (which predated the modern-day <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> sensor, which Oldsmobile used with their Quad 4 in the late 1980s with a cast-in toothed section of the crankshaft), a special distributor, an engine temperature sensor, and a rudimentary computer mounted inside the car, under the dash. No other years or models were provided with this system.|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} Jeep application, the {{ignition}} control module (ICM) {{is located in}} engine compartment. It consists of a solid-state ignition circuit, {{as well as an}} integrated ignition coil that can be removed and serviced separately. Electronic signals from the ECU to the ICM determine the amount of ignition timing or retard needed to meet engine power requirements. The ECU provides an input signal to the ICM. The ICM has outputs for a tach signal to the tachometer and a high voltage signal from the coil to the distributor. The <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> sensor senses TDC (Top Dead Center) and BDC crankshaft positions, as well as engine rpm. This sensor is secured by special shouldered bolts to flywheel/drive plate housing and is not adjustable.|$|E
5000|$|The engine can {{be mounted}} in {{transverse}} <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> as on Harley-Davidsons, Ducatis and many recent Japanese motorcycles. This layout produces a twin cylinder motorcycle engine that {{is little or}} no wider than a single. A narrower engine can be mounted lower in the frame with handling benefits. A disadvantage of this configuration for air-cooled engines is that the two cylinders receive different air-flows and cooling of the rear cylinder tends to be restricted. Cooling problems are somewhat mitigated by having all [...] "four" [...] sides of each cylinder exposed to air flow. This differs from a parallel-twin cylinder engine which has a distinct front, back, and sides, but the inside of each cylinder is not exposed to airflow as the cylinders are typically joined together with a cam chain running up through the block in-between the cylinders.|$|E
50|$|The AW4 is {{also used}} behind the 2.5 L (150 CID) AMC Straight-4 engine. It has a {{removable}} bell housing with a mount for the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> sensor. Early AW4s used 21-spline output shafts. In 1991 the AW4 was changed to a 23-spline output shaft, concurrent with adoption of the High Output (commonly known as H.O.) inline six-cylinder engine. Some sources state that the output shaft spline change occurred for the 1990 model year. The change most likely occurred during the 1990 model run with early 1990 models receiving 21-spline transmission and later models receiving 23-spline. If swapping transmissions in 1990 model year vehicles either swap the transfer case as well or make sure to check spline count. The input on the transfer case can also be changed to match the output shaft spline count. Rear-wheel-drive-only transmissions {{all have the same}} spline count on the output shaft, only 4x4 models are affected by differing spline count.|$|E

The cylinder heads were redesigned, using improved ports and combustion chambers similar to those in the Generation II LT1, resulting in significant power increases. The intake manifold bolt pattern was also changed to four bolts per cylinder head instead of the [...] "traditional" [...] five bolts. The cylinder block timing cover lip was thickened for use with the plastic timing cover (redesigned for use with a <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> sensor with integrated dowel pins - cylinder blocks for 1996+ do not have dowel pins in the timing cover flange) held with 8 bolts and the water pump bypass hole on the RH deck and below the water pump passage undrilled. Also the fuel pump boss is still present but undrilled (which dates back to the 1992 model year).|$|E
50|$|The {{most notable}} {{change of the}} RC45 when {{released}} {{was the use of}} Programmed Fuel Injection. Fuel injection had been used on bikes previously but these had either been rather antiquated analog computers or very simple digital units with a minimal number of sensors for input, which resulted in very crude fueling. The RC30 had used 38 mm constant velocity carburettors which, for road use are quite nice, maintaining a high air velocity across a wide rpm range, though were not as well suited for racing. The RC45 did away with carburetors and in their absence a brace of four 46 mm throttles were replaced, Honda now had the throttle area it needed to make big horsepower at high revolutions. The system Honda used on the RC45 was very similar to the system used on the NR750. Contrary to popular belief the RC45’s fuel injection is not like a 4-stage carburetor, rather it is a proper fuel only system. Honda kept the ignition system separate. The Honda system obtained information from the following sensors: <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> sensor, camshaft position sensor, air temperature sensor, coolant temperature sensor, manifold absolute pressure sensor, throttle position sensor, barometric sensor and battery voltage. With all of these sensors relaying information to the ECU, Honda could have quite easily incorporated the ignition control unit. The reason that they had not came down to the supplier of parts: they had different manufacturers supplying the ecu and cdi units. Regardless, it allowed the use of very large throttle plates seamlessly over a very wide engine operating range. The engine of the RC45 also used many magnesium castings, as of rather recently, it has become quite common to see fuel injection and magnesium engine parts on motorcycles, though in the early-to-mid 1990’s this was expensive and incredibly innovative.|$|E
