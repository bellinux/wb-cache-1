40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{evidence that}} when an analyst makes an out-of-consensus forecast of a company’s quarterly earnings {{that turns out}} to be incorrect, she escalates her commitment to maintaining an out-ofconsensus view on the company. Relative to an analyst who was close to the consensus, the out-of-consensus analyst adjusts her forecasts for the <b>current</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>year’s</b> earnings less in the direction of the quarterly earnings surprise. On average, this type of updating behavior reduces forecasting accuracy, so it does not seem to reflect superior private information. Further empirical results suggest that analysts do not have financial incentives to stand by extreme stock calls in the face of contradictory evidence.

This research focuses on the project selection process for the Department of Public Works for the Presidio of Monterey Army instillations in the Monterey area. The results from the <b>current</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>years</b> selection process are compared with the results from the optimization model. This demonstrates how analytical tools, specifically an optimization model, can add value to an organization by increasing the number of projects selected.

It will be observed from this report that the amount of receipts over expenditures has been but $2,344,882.30 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1874, and that for the <b>current</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>year</b> the estimated receipts over expenditures will not much exceed $9,000,000. In view of the large national debt existing and the obligation to add 1 per cent per annum to the sinking fund, a sum amounting now to over $34,000,000 per annum, I submit whether revenues should not be increased or expenditures diminished to reach this amount of surplus. Not to provide for the sinking fund is a partial failure to comply with the contracts and obligations of the Government. At the last session of Congress a very considerable reduction was made in rates of taxation and in the number of articles submitted to taxation; the question may well be asked, whether or not, in some instances, unwisely. In connection with this subject, too, I venture the opinion that the means of collecting the revenue, especially from imports, have been so embarrassed by legislation as to make it questionable whether or not large amounts are not lost by failure to collect, to the direct loss of the Treasury and to the prejudice of the interests of honest importers and taxpayers.|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In 2010, the Department of Defense (DOD) estimated that corrosion costs the DOD over $ 22. 9 billion annually. Corrosion negatively affects all military assets, including both equipment and infrastructure, and {{is defined as the}} unintended destruction or deterioration of a material due to its interaction with the environment. Corrosion also affects military readiness, taking critical systems out of action and creating safety hazards. Congress has enacted several legislative requirements to address the high cost of corrosion on military equipment and infrastructure, including legislation that created the Office of Corrosion Policy and Oversight (Corrosion Office) within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. The Corrosion Office is responsible for the prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military equipment and infrastructure and, according to officials, manages funding for DOD-wide corrosion prevention and control (CPC) activities and CPC projects proposed by the Military Departments. Section 2228 (e) of Title 10 of the United States Code requires DOD to annually report on CPC funding to Congress. Additionally, the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Year</b> 2009 required each Military Department's corrosion control and prevention executive to submit an annual report with recommendations pertaining to his or her Department's CPC program, including corrosion-related funding levels to carry out all of the duties of the executive. In <b>fiscal</b> <b>year</b> (FY) 2011, Congress expanded the requirement for DOD to report on its CPC efforts by adding to or revising existing elements. Section 2228 (e), as recently amended, requires DOD to annually submit a report to Congress on corrosion funding as part of its annual budget submission. In the report, DOD is to address funding requirements for its long-term corrosion reduction strategy, the return on investment (ROI) that would be achieved by implementing the strategy, the <b>current</b> and previous <b>fiscal</b> <b>year</b> funds requested in the budget compared to funding requirements, an explanation if funding requirements are not fully funded in the budget, and the <b>current</b> and previous <b>fiscal</b> <b>year</b> amount of funds requested in the budget for each project or activity described in its long-term strategy compared to the funding requirements for the project or activity.
