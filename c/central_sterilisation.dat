40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the occurrence of free-living amoebae in the water system of a teaching hospital in Johannesburg (South Africa). Water and biofilm samples were collected from the theatres, theatre sterilisation service unit, <b>central</b> <b>sterilisation</b> service unit and endoscopy/bronchoscopy unit. The samples were filtered and seeded on non-nutrient agar spread with heat-killed Escherichia coli. Of the 71 samples collected, 63 (88. 7 %) were positive for free-living amoeba. Acanthamoeba spp., Balamuthia spp. and Hartmanella spp. were identified by morphology. The presence of free-living amoeba in the hospital water network may be a potential health risk...|$|E
40|$|The main {{motivation}} for this thesis {{comes from the}} lack of studies on issues related to <b>central</b> bank’s monetary <b>sterilisation</b> bonds (MSBs). The MSBs have been, in particular, issued in emerging economies to offset the impacts of sterilised FX market interventions. The objectives of this thesis are to examine the impacts of and {{motivation for}} sterilised FX interventions and to explore methodologies to assess the sustainability of MSB-dependent sterilisation policy. Chapter 2 overviews the main theoretical issues and statistical facts related to sterilisations, Chapter 3 and 4 investigate the impacts, profits and motives of sterilised FX interventions in selected countries, focusing on the asymmetric intervention preferences. Chapter 5 compares the degree of sterilisation and de facto capital mobility – focusing on emerging countries under inflation targeting – by estimating sterilisation and offset coefficient with panel data for 30 countries. Chapter 6 proposes several methodologies for assessing the sustainability of MSB-dependent sterilisation policy. We modify theories of fiscal sustainability and then derive central bank's intertemporal budget constraint, which is separated from the central governments. Several sustainability conditions are obtained, based on cointegration relation between total revenues and expenditures or on central bank’s monetary reaction function. Then, the sustainability tests are applied to empirical studies on the Bank of Korea’s sterilisation policy. ...|$|R
40|$|The study {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between public debt, external and internal disequilibrium and inflation in Hungary through changes {{in the public sector}} borrowing requirement and in the structure of budget financing. The analysis is based on data from the 1986 - 1997 period in order to put the changes in true perspective. Policy constraints stemming from high indebtedness and their macroeconomic consequences are analysed by comparing different measures of fiscal deficit, as well as by quantifying the factors determining the evolution of the public debt/GDP ratio. We focus on the operational deficit (which is derived from the nominal deficit by eliminating the inflation compensation component of interest payments) and on its financing. The study presents a detailed empirical analysis of the evolution of the financing structure (seigniorage - debt) {{as well as of the}} role and structural changes of debt financing. The calculations are based on net consolidated public debt, which includes the combined debt of the budget and the central bank to other sectors net of claims. The consolidation of budget and central bank balances is unavoidable in order to get reliable indicators of the fiscal stance since in Hungary the central bank has been responsible for borrowing abroad in its own name. We introduced the category of ?extended??consolidated public debt (including the stock of <b>central</b> bank’s <b>sterilisation</b> instruments) which enabled us to analyse the past eleven years in a consistent framework, and to reveal the trends as well as the dynamic relationships of the debt accumulation process. The analysis shows that the shift to a new regime of deficit financing based on issuing marketable government securities (in 1992) did not increase the fiscal burden, it merely revealed its true magnitude by separating monetary and fiscal functions and by increasing transparency. The analysis of consolidated debt revealed that throughout the last ten years the implicit real interest rates on public debt exceeded the growth rate of the economy, which led to the continuous increase of the debt ratio (the gross debt/GDP around 90 % in the middle of nineties). This effect was mitigated only from 1995 by the fiscal adjustment resulting a primary surplus in the budget. The seigniorage did not play an important role in financing after 1992, it amounted to 1 - 2 % of GDP. However, the major element in the significant (over 15 percentage points) reduction in the debt-to- GDP ratio over the last three years was the devotion of privatisation revenues to retire public debt. Analysing past developments, we came to the conclusion that despite the significant reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio in the last few years, the debt burden is still significant and a further reduction of the debt to GDP ratio is inevitable in order to create the conditions for sustainable growth and to ensure the continuous convergence to developed countries. This requires a structural primary surplus of 1. 5 - 2 % of GDP in the medium run, if we take into account the requirement of sustainability, the goal of further reductions in the inflation rate and the fact that with the end of the privatisation process privatisation revenues will not provide additional sources for financing. ...|$|R
40|$|This study, is {{a result}} of a {{collaboration}} between Uddevalla hospital, Västra Götalandsregionen, and Chalmers University of Technology. The purpose of the study is to designing a new materials supply process of surgical material for the operation clinic at Uddevalla hospital which enables for decreased changeover time between surgeries. The study is conducted at Uddevalla hospital, a hospital which provides elective patient care. The flow of surgical material towards the part of the operation clinic that performs hip surgery is investigated. In order to map out the flow of surgical material towards the operation clinic, the project team follows the material from contamination during surgery, to it being back in the operation clinic storage, sterilised and packed. Data is collected through literature search, and a combination of structured observations and semi-structured interviews at Uddevalla hospital, NÄL hospital, and Mölndal hospital. During the data collection and the description of the current situation at Uddevalla hospital, it is made clear that material handling activities take place at the operation clinic which could be performed elsewhere by other personnel. Further, handling of separate disposable articles is identified as time consuming, and the operation table setting is appointed as the activity that effect the changeover time the most. A new materials supply process is suggested in which the activities operation cart packing and disinfection are externalised from the changeover process at the operation clinic to the <b>central</b> <b>sterilisation</b> department. Further, the project team recommends the introduction of operation table setting rooms. The project team also suggests the introduction of procedure packs, which are packages in which all disposable material needed for a type of surgery are combined in a single package. The new materials supply process, through externalisation of material handling activities, freesup time for the operation clinic personnel, and enables for more patient care, hence reduced changeover time between surgeries. The operation table setting rooms allow the operation table setting to be performed during ongoing surgery. The procedure packs simplify the cart packing by reducing the number of articles to collect, and they speed-up the operation table setting since fewer packages have to be opened. The externalisation of the disinfection process and the operation cart packing require a new ITsystem in which orders can be placed and information sharing between the <b>central</b> <b>sterilisation</b> department and the operation clinic is enabled. To further improve the communication between the two units, it would be beneficial if they could be located on the same floor, which requires a new operation building...|$|E
