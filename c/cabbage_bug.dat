50|$|Eurydema oleracea is {{a species}} of shield bug in the Pentatomidae family and is {{commonly}} known as the rape bug, the crucifer shield bug, the <b>cabbage</b> <b>bug</b> or the brassica bug.|$|E
50|$|The {{harlequin}} <b>cabbage</b> <b>bug</b> (Murgantia histrionica), {{also known}} as calico bug, fire bug or harlequin bug, is a black stinkbug of the family Pentatomidae, brilliantly marked with red, orange and yellow markings. It is destructive to cabbage and related plants in tropical America as well as throughout most of North America, especially the warmer parts of the United States. In addition to cabbage {{it can be a}} major pest to crops such as broccoli, radishes, and the ornamental flower cleome. Nymphs are active during the summer and in the tropics the bug can achieve three to six generations a year. In the northern range there is only one generation annually and the insects overwinter as adults.|$|E

40|$|In 2010, we were {{determining}} {{the contents of}} glucosinolates in different Brassicas in order to study their influence on feeding of <b>cabbage</b> stink <b>bugs</b> (Eurydema spp.) and the consequent extent of damage. We confirmed that glucosinolates content depends on plant species, plant organs {{and the time of}} sampling. In the samples aliphatic glucosinolates (glucoiberin, progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, epiprogoitrin, sinigrin, gluconapin, glucoraphenin, sinalbin) prevailed. Glucobrassicin, an important indolic glucosinolate compound, was detected in all tested Brassicas. Its concentration in the oil radish samples was highest during the first assessment (30 DAS), 8. 84 ± 0. 65 µmol g- 1 ds, while the oilseed rape samples displayed lowest concentration during the last assessment (134 DAS), 4. 30 ± 0. 80 µmol g- 1 ds. The stimulative activity of individual glucosinolates or their negative influence on feeding of <b>cabbage</b> stink <b>bugs</b> in the Brassicas used in our experiment was not uniformly manifested. Based on a two-year field experiment we concluded that oil rape was the most adequate trap crop used to allure <b>cabbage</b> stink <b>bugs.</b> In future, glucosinolates should be employed to a greater extent in environmentally acceptable ways of food production, one of which is also the use of trap crops in order to reduce harmful effects of <b>cabbage</b> stink <b>bugs.</b>  In 2010, we were {{determining the}} contents of glucosinolates in different Brassicas in order to study their influence on feeding of <b>cabbage</b> stink <b>bugs</b> (Eurydema spp.) and the consequent extent of damage.

5000|$|The first gig HR&TVU played was at Annie Miller's in Glasgow in 1989, {{supported}} by The Harlequin <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Bugs</b> followed by The State Bar {{where they were}} {{supported by}} The Rhythm Kittens. On both occasions, members of the support bands also took part in Hugh Reed and the Velvet Underpants' set. For the Annie Miller's gig, Hugh Reed used a bass borrowed from Lindsey Watt of Halcyon Days after breaking the strings of his own bass during the sound check. Video footage of the gig shows the Halcyon Days logo stuck {{to the front of}} the bass.|$|R

40|$|In {{a two-year}} field experiment, we studied {{the extent of}} damage caused by <b>cabbage</b> stink <b>bugs</b> (Eurydema spp.) on the frame leaves and the outer leaves of cabbage heads in {{relation}} to genotype color. We established that the extent of damage varied with genotype color. In both years of the experiment, the affinity of Eurydema spp. toward green genotypes was significantly greater on the first four assessment dates (from the third decade of May to the third decade of June), while on the remaining dates (from the third decade of July to the second decade of August) we did not establish any differences between the white and red genotypes. <b>Cabbage</b> stink <b>bugs</b> first appeared on white cabbage genotypes. The antioxidative potential conditioned by the content of anthocyanins was significantly higher on the red cabbage genotypes. Research shows that higher antioxidative potential is related to a lower extent of damage caused by Eurydema spp. The average value of antioxidative potential in the cabbage varieties was 0. 58 mmol/ 100 g of the sample, while in the hybrids it was 0. 47 ± 0. 01 mmol/ 100 g. We confirmed significant differences in values of antioxidative potential between red (0. 68 mmol/ 100 g) and white (0. 48 mmol/ 100 g) cabbage genotypes. Between mid-late (0. 55 mmol/ 100 g) and mid-early (0. 53 mmol/ 100 g) cabbage genotypes we did not establish differences in antioxidative potential levels, while the average value of this parameter in the early genotypes (0. 46 mmol/ 100 g) was significantly low. We established that the color of plants (cabbage) {{represents one of the}} successful factors of antixenosis and has the potential for reducing the damage caused by <b>cabbage</b> stink <b>bugs</b> in environmentally acceptable systems of cabbage production...|$|R
