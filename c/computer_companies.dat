5|$|New {{industry}} {{came from}} iron ore, {{discovered in the}} north, mined relatively easily from open pits, and shipped to Great Lakes steel mills from the ports at Duluth and Two Harbors. Economic development and social changes led to an expanded role for state government and a population shift from rural areas to cities. The Great Depression brought layoffs in mining and tension in labor relations but New Deal programs helped the state. After World War II, Minnesota became known for technology, fueled by early <b>computer</b> <b>companies</b> Sperry Rand, Control Data and Cray. The Twin Cities also became a regional center for the arts with cultural {{institutions such as the}} Guthrie Theater, Minnesota Orchestra, and the Walker Art Center.|$|E
25|$|Wang Labs {{would be}} only one {{of a large number}} of New England-based <b>computer</b> <b>companies</b> that would falter in the late 1980s and 1990s, marking the end of the Massachusetts Miracle. For {{instance}} the struggling Digital Equipment Corporation also significantly downsized in the 1990s and was acquired by Compaq.|$|E
25|$|Under Binger's {{stewardship}} from 1961 to 1978 {{the company}} expanded into such fields as defense, aerospace, computers and cameras. Honeywell {{was one of}} the eight major <b>computer</b> <b>companies</b> (with IBM — the largest — Burroughs, Scientific Data Systems, Control Data Corporation, General Electric, RCA and UNIVAC) through most of the 1960s. In 1970, Honeywell bought General Electric's computer division.|$|E
50|$|Nixdorf Computer AG was a West German <b>computer</b> <b>company</b> {{founded by}} Heinz Nixdorf in 1952. Headquartered in Paderborn, Germany, {{it became the}} fourth largest <b>computer</b> <b>company</b> in Europe, and a {{worldwide}} specialist in banking and point-of-sale systems.|$|R
50|$|People's <b>Computer</b> <b>Company</b> (PCC) was an organization, a {{newsletter}} (the People's <b>Computer</b> <b>Company</b> Newsletter) and, later, a quasiperiodical called the Dragonsmoke.

25|$|Wang {{was one of}} {{the first}} <b>computer</b> <b>companies</b> to {{advertise}} on television, and the first to run an ad during the Super Bowl in 1978. Their first ad literally cast Wang Laboratories as David and IBM as Goliath, several years before the famous 1984 Apple Computer ad. A later ad depicted Wang Laboratories as a helicopter gunship taking aim at IBM.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Fred Wang, then 36 years old, was {{installed}} {{as president of}} Wang Laboratories. However, the company's fortunes continued to decline. Unlike most <b>computer</b> <b>companies</b> that funded their growth by issuing stock, An Wang had used debt to avoid further dilution of family control of the company. By August 1989, that debt was causing conflicts with its creditors. On August 4, 1989, An Wang fired his son. Richard W. Miller replaced him {{as the president of}} Wang Laboratories, having been with the company since 1988.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} {{conceived}} as an animated film bracketed with live-action sequences. The rest would involve {{a combination of}} computer-generated visuals and back-lit animation. Lisberger planned to finance the movie independently by approaching several <b>computer</b> <b>companies</b> but had little success. However, one company, Information International Inc., was receptive. He met with Richard Taylor, a representative, and they began talking about using live-action photography with back-lit animation {{in such a way}} that it could be integrated with computer graphics. At this point, Lisberger already had a script written and the film entirely storyboarded with some computer animation tests completed. He had spent approximately $300,000 developing Tron and had also secured $4–5 million in private backing before reaching a standstill. Lisberger and Kushner took their storyboards and samples of computer-generated films to Warner Bros., MGM, and Columbia Pictures– all of which turned them down.|$|E

25|$|The JPEG {{committee}} {{investigated the}} patent claims in 2002 and {{were of the}} opinion that they were invalidated by prior art. Others also concluded that Forgent did not have a patent that covered JPEG. Nevertheless, between 2002 and 2004 Forgent was able to obtain about US$105 million by licensing their patent to some 30 companies. In April 2004, Forgent sued 31 other companies to enforce further license payments. In July of the same year, a consortium of 21 large <b>computer</b> <b>companies</b> filed a countersuit, with the goal of invalidating the patent. In addition, Microsoft launched a separate lawsuit against Forgent in April 2005. In February 2006, the United States Patent and Trademark Office agreed to re-examine Forgent's JPEG patent {{at the request of the}} Public Patent Foundation. On May 26, 2006 the USPTO found the patent invalid based on prior art. The USPTO also found that Forgent knew about the prior art, and did not tell the Patent Office, making any appeal to reinstate the patent highly unlikely to succeed.|$|E
2500|$|In many {{industries}} (especially {{those with}} high fixed costs and either low marginal costs or low reverse engineering costs— computer processors, and pharmaceuticals for example), once an invention exists, the cost of commercialization (testing, tooling up a factory, developing a market, etc.) {{is far more than}} the initial conception cost.

2500|$|Ed Roberts had {{designed}} and manufactured programmable calculators and {{was familiar with}} the microprocessors available in 1974. He thought the Intel 4004 and Intel 8008 were not powerful enough (in fact two microcomputers based on the Intel 8008 were already on the market: The Micral marketed in January 1973 by the French company R2E and the MCM/70 marketed in 1974 by the Canadian company Micro Computer Machines); the National Semiconductor IMP-8 and IMP-16 required external hardware; the Motorola 6800 was still in development. So he chose the 8-bit Intel 8080. At that time, Intel's main business was selling memory chips by the thousands to <b>computer</b> <b>companies.</b> They had no experience in selling small quantities of microprocessors. When the 8080 was introduced in April 1974, Intel set the single unit price at $360 (About $1,700 in 2014 dollars). [...] "That figure had a nice ring to it," [...] recalled Intel's Dave House in 1984. [...] "Besides, it was a computer, and they usually cost thousands of dollars, so we felt it was a reasonable price." [...] Ed Roberts had experience in buying OEM quantities of calculator chips {{and he was able to}} negotiate a $75 price (about $350 in 2014 dollars) for the 8080 microprocessor chips.|$|E
