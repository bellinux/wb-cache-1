5|$|Peada's {{conversion}} {{and the introduction}} of priests into Middle Anglia <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as evidence of Penda's tolerance of Christianity, given the absence of evidence that he sought to interfere. On the other hand, an interpretation is also possible whereby the marriage and conversion <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as corresponding to a successful attempt on Oswiu's part to expand Bernician influence at Penda's expense; Higham saw Peada's conversion more in terms of political manoeuvring on both sides than religious zeal.|$|E
