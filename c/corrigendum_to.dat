The results are therefore valid for general dark energy models and (most) modified gravity models. We use an innovative approach based on the recently proposed "geodesic light-cone" gauge. We then compare our finding with other results, which recently appeared in the literature, for the particular case of vanishing anisotropic stress. Arriving at a common accepted expression for the non-linear and relativistic corrections to the redshift and distance-redshift relation is of fundamental importance in view of future cosmological surveys. Thanks to these surveys the Universe will be further probed with high precision and at very different scales, where non-linear and relativistic effects can play a key role.

(GUL Reference GB 0247 MS Gen 1132). The title page of the manuscript bears the name of Sir William Dunlop, 1699. Inside is a letter from Dr Meek, which, by order of the Senate of the University in 1792, was to be “securely” bound to the manuscript. The letter was to Professor George Jardine, dated 20 December 1791. It provides some information about the manuscript's likely origins. Meek thanks [...] "the Faculty" [...] for allowing him to see the manuscript and states that [...] "About the year 1699, Mr William Dunlop Principal of the University of Glasgow, got this work transcribed from a copy that seems to have belonged to the General Assembly, which copy was lost, or more probably burnt about two years after... by a fire, 28 October 1701, in the house of Mr Nicol Spense sub-clerk to the Assembly. This circumstance renders your M.S. more valuable; for notwithstanding its imperfections it ought now perhaps to be considered, as the most authentic Register of the proceedings of the Kirk of Scotland for almost 60 years after the Reformation."Meek then reports that he has compared the document with the manuscript of David Calderwood’s History of the Kirk of Scotland (completed about 1650).

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} two weaker forms of {{injectivity}} which {{turn out to have}} a rich structure behind: separable injectivity and universal separable injectivity. We show several structural and stability properties of these classes of Banach spaces. We provide natural examples of (universally) separably injective spaces, including L_∞ ultraproducts built over countably incomplete ultrafilters, {{in spite of the fact}} that these ultraproducts are never injective. We obtain two fundamental characterizations of universally separably injective spaces: a) A Banach space E is universally separably injective if and only if every separable subspace is contained in a copy of ℓ_∞ inside E. b) A Banach space E is universally separably injective if and only if for every separable space S one has (ℓ_∞/S, E) = 0. The final Section of the paper focuses on special properties of 1 -separably injective spaces. Lindenstrauss obtained in the middle sixties a result that can be understood as a proof that, under the continuum hypothesis, 1 -separably injective spaces are 1 -universally separably injective; he left open the question in ZFC. We construct a consistent example of a Banach space of type C(K) which is 1 -separably injective but not 1 -universally separably injective. We show that, under the continuum hypothesis, "to be universally separably injective" is not a 3 -space property, as we wrongly claimed in the paper mentioned in the title.

This programme examines long term changes for legacy and some emerging contaminants in biota {{along the coast of}} Norway from the Oslofjord and Hvaler region in the southeast to the Varangerfjord in the northeast, in both polluted areas and areas remote from point sources. The 2012 -investigation included the monitoring of blue mussel (23 stations), dog whelk (8 stations), common periwinkle (1 station) cod (14 stations) and seawater (passive samplers, 3 stations). Thirty contaminants were chosen for this report as reasonable representation of the chemicals investigated. This selection has 272 time series of which there were statistically significant trends in 50 cases: 34 (12. 5 %) were downwards and 16 (5. 9 %) upwards. The dominance of downward trends indicates that contamination is decreasing. Of the 272 cases, 156 could be classified by the environmental classification system used by the Norwegian Environment Agency, 81. 4 % were classified as insignificantly polluted, 13. 5 % as moderately polluted, 4. 5 % as markedly polluted, 0 % as severely polluted and 0. 6 % as extremely polluted. Analyses of HBCD, SCCP, MCCP, PFRs, BPA, and TBBPA and the use of passive samplers were included in this programme for the first time. Some cases warrant special concern. These were for example upward trend for mercury in cod fillet from the inner Oslofjord, high concentrations of hexabromocyclododecane (a-HBCD) in cod liver from the same area, and high concentrations of medium chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCP) in cod liver from SørfjordMiljødirektorate...|$|R
40|$|Context: Outflows are an {{important}} part of the star formation process as both the result of ongoing active accretion and one of the main sources of mechanical feedback on small scales. Water is the ideal tracer of these effects because it is present in high abundance in various parts of the protostar. Method: We present Herschel HIFI spectra of multiple water-transitions towards 29 nearby Class 0 /I protostars as part of the WISH Survey. These are decomposed into different Gaussian components, with each related to one of three parts of the protostellar system; quiescent envelope, cavity shock and spot shocks in the jet and at the base of the outflow. We then constrain the excitation conditions present in the two outflow-related components. Results: Water emission is optically thick but effectively thin, with line ratios that do not vary with velocity, in contrast to CO. The physical conditions of the cavity and spot shocks are similar, with post-shock H_ 2 densities of order 10 ^ 5 - 10 ^ 8 cm^- 3 and H_ 2 O column densities of order 10 ^ 16 - 10 ^ 18 cm^- 2. H_ 2 O emission originates in compact emitting regions: for the spot shocks these correspond to point sources with radii of order 10 - 200 AU, while for the cavity shocks these come from a thin layer along the outflow cavity wall with thickness of order 1 - 30 AU. Conclusions: Water emission at the source position traces two distinct kinematic components in the outflow; J shocks at the base of the outflow or in the jet, and C shocks in a thin layer in the cavity wall. Class I sources have similar excitation conditions to Class 0 sources, but generally smaller line-widths and emitting region sizes. We suggest that it is the velocity of the wind driving the outflow, rather than the decrease in envelope density or mass, that is the cause of the decrease in H_ 2 O intensity between Class 0 and I.
