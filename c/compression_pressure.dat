50|$|Internal {{compression}} {{refers to}} the compression of air within the supercharger itself, which, already at or close to boost level, can be delivered smoothly to the engine {{with little or no}} back flow. This is more effective than back flow compression and allows higher efficiency to be achieved. Internal compression devices usually use a fixed internal compression ratio. When the boost pressure is equal to the <b>compression</b> <b>pressure</b> of the supercharger, the back flow is zero. If the boost pressure exceeds that <b>compression</b> <b>pressure,</b> back flow can still occur as in a roots blower. Internal compression blowers must be matched to the expected boost pressure in order to achieve the higher efficiency they are capable of, otherwise they will suffer the same problems and low efficiency of the roots blowers.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} a weakly cationic exchange poly(methacrylic acid-co-divinylbenzene) resin (PMD) {{as a new}} filler-binder for direct compression tablets. Methods: Powder properties of PMD and MCC were characterized. Tablets made from PMD and MCC with and without propranolol hydrochloride were evaluated for diameter, thickness, friability, assay, disintegration, dissolution and compression behavior. Results: Tablets made from PMD (thickness: 3. 54 - 4. 46 mm) were thicker than those of MCC (2. 93 - 3. 33 mm). At <b>compression</b> <b>pressures</b> ≥ 309 MPa, the crushing strength of PMD tablets was so high that it exceeded {{the capacity of the}} tester (500 N). PMD tablets rapidly disintegrated (0. 43 - 9. 56 min), but MCC tablets did not disintegrate within 60 min. The crushing strength of PMD tablets containing 10 and 100 mg propranolol hydrochloride was 406. 1 and 177. 9 N, respectively, which were lower than that of tablets without the drug. Tablets made from PMD also exhibited faster drug dissolution. The slopes of the linear portions of Heckel plots for PMD and MCC were comparable (5. 02 × 10 - 3 and 5. 12 × 10 - 3 MPa- 1), respectively. Conclusion: PMD has good compressibility at high <b>compression</b> <b>pressures,</b> which should make it a suitable filler-binder for direct compression tablets...|$|R
50|$|Waulis design {{describes}} a crank device and an adjusting device of a combustion engine. The system adjusts the cylinder {{pressure of the}} motor {{in accordance with the}} required power. Adjustment of the cylinder pressure is achieved by changing the compression ratio by means of the adjusting device. The adjusting device moves an eccentric wheel to a set position using an adjusting wheel; this results in the connecting rod moving the piston to a desired distance from the cylinder head. The adjusting device measures the volume of the air entering the cylinder and adjusts the compression ratio appropriately. The adjusting device also takes into account the speed of rotation to adjust the <b>compression</b> <b>pressure</b> accordingly.|$|E
50|$|There is {{also the}} {{possibility}} of even greater fuel efficiency {{at the expense of}} outright power. The Helical Camshaft and the general principle of LIVC also allow the possible use of a very high compression ratio (CR). The idea here being to use a very high geometrical CR but limit the <b>compression</b> <b>pressure</b> by LIVC so as to avoid detonation. The expansion ratio after combustion still remains high. It is the expansion ratio that fundamentally converts the heat energy of the burning fuel/air mixture into usable mechanical energy. The more the hot gases are expanded by the moving piston the more the heat energy is converted into useful work and the higher the thermal efficiency is. This general principle is usually called the “Atkinson Cycle”. (Strictly speaking the Atkinson Cycle refers to an engine with mechanically different length compression and expansion strokes. In modern practice, the <b>compression</b> <b>pressure</b> is limited by a fixed amount of intake valve late closing - this has exactly the same effect as the different stroke lengths). With the Atkinson Cycle the added efficiency is at the expense of reduced overall power. For example, if an engine had a geometrical CR of 18:1 {{it would have to be}} restricted to about half its full charge of air/fuel mixture to avoid detonation. The resulting effect would be that at full load the engine would use half the fuel but the power would be not half but roughly two-thirds or three quarters that of the equivalent “normal” engine - the net result being an increase in thermal efficiency. Such an engine would be economical but it would still suffer from intake pumping losses.|$|E
50|$|The {{condition}} {{of a head}} gasket is typically investigated by checking the <b>compression</b> <b>pressure</b> with a pressure gauge, or better, a leak-down test, and/or noting any indication of combustion gases in the cooling system on a water-cooled engine. Oil mixed with coolant and excessive coolant loss with no apparent cause, or presence of carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon gases in the expansion tank of the cooling system can also be signs of head gasket problems. A good sign of head gasket failure on water-cooled engines {{is the presence of}} a substance that resembles mayonnaise in the oil, often to be seen on the dipstick, or oil filler cap. However, the presence of this substance is not conclusive proof of head gasket failure, since oil could mix with the coolant via other routes.|$|E

Moreover, the lower <b>compression</b> <b>pressures</b> required to “fill” ANG tanks also allows for the more rapid growth of a ubiquitous CNG refueling network. Due to the significantly lower capital investment associated with lower compression requirements, CNG infrastructure will be more easily and cost-effectively added to the network of gas stations and truck stop.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. One way {{to develop}} a new {{composite}} material or to improve its performance is to reinforce the matrix with a stronger dispersive phase. In principal, nanodiamonds can be used as reinforcement of composites owing to high surface energy, which allows an effective structure interaction with most utilized matrices. In this work, polycrystalline metallic–based composites and polymeric-based composites were investigated for the effect caused by addition of nanodiamonds. These composites were obtained at high <b>compression</b> <b>pressures</b> and combine with temperatures for certain short processing times.

5000|$|Model diesels have {{variable}} compression ratios. This variable compression {{is achieved}} by a [...] "contra-piston," [...] {{at the top of}} the cylinder, which can be adjusted by a screwed [...] "T-bar". The swept volume of the engine remains the same, but as the volume of the combustion chamber at top dead center is changed by adjusting the contra-piston, the compression ratio (swept volume + combustion chamber / combustion chamber) changes accordingly.There also exist model diesels with fixed compression heads. A few examples are the British 5cc OWAT or the American DRONE.These engines have a fixed compression ratio, but the compression can be altered slightly with the use of more or less lubrication oil in the fuel.Also the engine's load affects the compression and ignition timing.Larger propellers give a longer combustion time and so higher compression.Smaller propellers reduce the load, and therefore the <b>compression</b> <b>pressure</b> build up, which changes the ignition timing to earlier.|$|E
50|$|Some prototypes {{have run}} very well using {{centrifugal}} controller/actuators. If it was desired {{to operate the}} Helical Camshaft to use both the LIVC and the high RPM aspects of the cam it would probably require hydraulic actuators on each cam to enable the LIVC to be used. Each Helical Camshaft would also need a phase-changing mechanism for the high RPM use. At low RPM and part-load the Helical Camshaft would be all LIVC. At high RPM and full load it would still require long duration from the Helical Camshaft but the phase changing mechanism would need to alter the all-on-the-closing-flank duration increase to something of a more symmetrical duration increase. All this possibly could be done mechanically but the sensible arrangement probably would be an externally powered arrangement with a computer/microprocessor {{to sort out the}} required amounts LIVC and phasing. For HCCI operation the picture is less clear but the very short (and thus very fast) axial movement that would be needed to change the <b>compression</b> <b>pressure</b> would seem to make the Helical Camshaft very suitable for this process.|$|E
50|$|The Helical Camshaft {{would allow}} both the Atkinson Cycle and LIVC {{to be applied}} simultaneously. The high CR would allow even greater amount of LIVC to be used at idle thus further {{reducing}} pumping losses and improving efficiency. The resulting engine would have a fuel economy very similar to (or better than) a diesel - and it could run on the cheaper LPG fuel. It would also be lighter in weight and cheaper to make than a diesel. A car fitted with such an engine {{would appear to be}} a much simpler and cheaper alternative to a “hybrid” car. (But a hybrid fitted with a Helical Camshaft/Atkinson/LIVC engine would be more economical still). One of the more recent “fashionable” areas of engine research at present is the Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (or HCCI) engine. It amounts to running a spark ignition engine at light or part load in a similar fashion to a diesel engine. HCCI requires the <b>compression</b> <b>pressure</b> to be very quickly and accurately altered so that the more-or-less controlled compression ignition doesn’t suddenly blossom into full-blown detonation. One of the main strengths of the Helical Camshaft is that it can do exactly that. However, {{it would seem that the}} easily controlled LIVC (with or without Atkinson high CR effects) is a much simpler way to control an engine than the decidedly risky HCCI process - and it is doubtful that HCCI is more fuel-efficient than LIVC, etc.|$|E
40|$|Compared to {{fuel cells}}, which possess similar cell architecture, flow {{batteries}} have poor performance. For example, conventional fuel cells can easily achieve current densities of 1. 5 A cm- 2 whereas the corresponding {{figure for the}} all vanadium flow battery (VFB) is {{an order of magnitude}} less, often less than 0. 2 A cm 2 [1]. Consequently, relatively large flow battery cells are required for a given power, increasing the cost of the technology. There are a few noticeable exceptions to the relatively poor performance of flow batteries, including the work of Zawodzinski et al. who achieved current densities in excess of 0. 8 A cm 2 with a VFB [2]. Most impressively, Weber and co-workers achieved current densities as high as 4 A cm 2 with a H 2 -Br 2 flow battery [3]. In both cases, the researchers used fuel cell components and fuel cell assembly techniques to minimize the cell ohmic resistance, particularly the contact resistance between the cell parts (electrodes, bipolar plates and current collectors). Typically, fuel cells are assembled using <b>compression</b> <b>pressures</b> of above 8 bar to minimize contact resistance. In comparison, flow batteries use <b>compression</b> <b>pressures</b> less than 1 bar during cell assembly with carbon fibre felt electrodes; hence contact resistance values are relatively high.

Solid state properties were analyzed with X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and the final compacts were visually observed to study the effects of compaction pressure on their surface properties.
