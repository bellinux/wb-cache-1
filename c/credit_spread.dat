25|$|The main number {{which is}} used to assess the value of the bond is the gross {{redemption}} yield. This is defined such that if all future interest and principal repayments are discounted back to the present, at an interest rate equal to the gross redemption yield (gross means pre-tax), then the discounted value is equal to the current market price of the bond (or the initial issue price if the bond is just being launched). Fixed income investments such as bonds and loans are generally priced as a <b>credit</b> <b>spread</b> above a low-risk reference rate, such as LIBOR or U.S. or German Government Bonds of the same duration. For example, if a 30-year mortgage denominated in US dollars has a gross redemption yield of 5% per annum and 30 year US Treasury Bonds have a gross redemption yield of 3% per annum (referred to as the risk free yield), the <b>credit</b> <b>spread</b> is 2% per annum (sometimes quoted as 200 basis points). The <b>credit</b> <b>spread</b> reflects the risk of default. Risk free interest rates are determined by market forces and vary over time, based on a variety of factors, such as current short-term interest rates, e.g. base rates set by central banks such as the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England in the UK, and the Euro Zone ECB. If the coupon on the bond is lower than the yield, then its price will be below the par value, and vice versa.|$|E

40|$|This study empirically {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the interaction between market and default risk on corporate <b>credit</b> <b>spreads.</b> Using <b>credit</b> default swap (CDS) spreads, we find that average <b>credit</b> <b>spreads</b> decrease in GDP growth rate, but increase in GDP growth volatility and jump risk in the equity market. At the market level, investor sentiment is the most important determinant of <b>credit</b> <b>spreads.</b> At the firm level, <b>credit</b> <b>spreads</b> generally rise with cash flow volatility and beta, with the effect of cash flow beta varying with market conditions. We identify implied volatility as the most significant determinant of default risk among firm-level characteristics.

Corporate yield curves are often quoted {{in terms of}} a [...] "credit spread" [...] over the relevant swap curve.

Specifically, I examine the forecasting power of the term structure of <b>credit</b> <b>spreads</b> for future GDP growth.

Using a parsimonious macro-finance term structure model that captures the joint dynamics of GDP, inflation, Treasury yields and <b>credit</b> <b>spreads,</b> I decompose the spreads and identify what drives the relationship between <b>credit</b> <b>spreads</b> and the real economy.

2500|$|Since 1991-92, most market-makers in Europe have {{employed}} binomial models to evaluate convertibles. Models were available from INSEAD, Trend Data of Canada, Bloomberg LP and from home-developed models, amongst others. [...] These models needed an input of <b>credit</b> <b>spread,</b> volatility for pricing (historic volatility often used), and the risk-free rate of return. The binomial calculation assumes {{there is a}} bell-shaped probability distribution to future share prices, and the higher the volatility, the flatter is the bell-shape. Where there are issuer calls and investor puts, these will affect the expected residual period of optionality, at different share price levels. The binomial value is a weighted expected value, (1) taking readings from all the different nodes of a lattice expanding out from current prices and (2) taking account of varying periods of expected residual optionality at different share price levels. See Lattice model (finance)#Hybrid Securities. The three biggest areas of subjectivity are (1) the rate of volatility used, for volatility is not constant, and (2) {{whether or not to}} incorporate into the model a cost of stock borrow, for hedge funds and market-makers. The third important factor is (3) the dividend status of the equity delivered, if the bond is called, as the issuer may time the calling of the bond to minimise the dividend cost to the issuer.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{relationship}} between <b>credit</b> <b>spreads</b> on sterling corporate bonds and the term structure of UK interest rates is explored. In particular, {{the question of whether}} <b>credit</b> <b>spreads</b> are a reliable indicator of corporate bond default risk is examined. Using daily price quotes from 1990 to 1998, a small negative relationship is identified between <b>credit</b> <b>spreads</b> on sterling investment-grade corporate bonds and the level and slope of the term structure of UK interest rates. The results are weaker than those found by some previous studies which examined {{the relationship between}} US corporate bond <b>credit</b> <b>spreads</b> and the term structure of US interest rates. The weakness of the relationship suggests that <b>credit</b> <b>spreads</b> on sterling investment-grade corporate bonds have been driven by factors other than default risk. If so, we should be cautious in interpreting such <b>credit</b> <b>spreads</b> as measures of bond default risk. This result is important to both those in the field of financial stability interested in leading indicators of corporate defaults, and to monetary policy makers interested in the impact of interest rate changes on corporate bond default risk. Similar work should be repeated for sterling sub investment-grade corporate bonds once a sufficiently large data set can be assembled. ...|$|R

We merge a dataset of firm-specific differences in beliefs and <b>credit</b> <b>spreads</b> and test these predictions empirically. The empirical tests provide 5 new results that are original to the literature: (a) Counter-cyclical uncertainty is positively related to a common disagreement component about future earning opportunities by financial analysts; (b) The common component of the difference in beliefs in earnings forecasts is the most significant variable in time-series regressions for <b>credit</b> <b>spreads.</b> At the same time, firm-specific difference in beliefs is the most significant component in the cross-section; (c) Uncertainty induces a significant co-movement between <b>credit</b> <b>spreads</b> and stock volatility; (d) During the 2008 Credit Crisis the link between uncertainty and <b>credit</b> <b>spreads</b> was even stronger than in previous crisis periods; (e) Uncertainty and belief heterogeneity have significant explanatory power for no-arbitrage violations implied by single factor models i...|$|R
