40|$|BACKGROUND The National Cancer Institute (NCI) designates <b>cancer</b> <b>centers</b> as {{regional}} {{centers of}} excellence {{in research and}} patient care. Although these centers often advertise their superior outcomes, their relative performance has not been examined empirically. In the current study, the authors assessed whether patients at NCI <b>cancer</b> <b>centers</b> compared with patients at control hospitals had lower mortality rates after major cancer surgery. METHODS Using the national Medicare database (1994 – 1999), the authors assessed surgical mortality and late survival rates for 63, 860 elderly patients undergoing resection for lung, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, bladder, or colon carcinoma. For assessing performance, patients treated at the 51 NCI <b>cancer</b> <b>centers</b> were compared with patients from 51 control hospitals with the highest volumes for each procedure. Mortality rates (surgical and 5 -year rates) were adjusted for patient characteristics and residual differences in procedure volume. RESULTS NCI <b>cancer</b> <b>centers</b> had lower adjusted surgical mortality rates than control hospitals for 4 of the 6 procedures, including colectomy (5. 4 % vs. 6. 7 %; P = 0. 026), pulmonary resection (6. 3 % vs. 7. 9 %; P = 0. 010), gastrectomy (8. 0 % vs. 12. 2 %; P < 0. 001), and esophagectomy (7. 9 % vs. 10. 9 %; P = 0. 027). Nonsignificant trends toward lower adjusted operative mortality rates at NCI <b>cancer</b> <b>centers</b> were also observed for cystectomy and pancreatic resection. Among patients surviving surgery, however, there were no important differences in subsequent 5 -year mortality rates between NCI <b>cancer</b> <b>centers</b> and control hospitals {{for any of the}} procedures. CONCLUSIONS For many cancer procedures, patients undergoing surgery at NCI-designated <b>cancer</b> <b>centers</b> had lower surgical mortality rates than those treated at comparably high-volume hospitals, but similar long-term survival rates.

40|$|In the United States, <b>cancer</b> <b>centers</b> {{commonly}} advertise clinical services {{directly to}} the public.
