40|$|The {{temperatures}} occuring in a {{machining operation}} affect the whole process, since parameters as tool wear, material behaviour and friction are influenced. A turning process with cutting {{speeds up to}} 100 m/s is investigated in this work for the workpiece materials AISI 1045 steel, AA 7075 aluminium, and Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium. The results show a strong temperature increase with rising cutting speed for the <b>chip</b> <b>bottom</b> surface approaching asymptotically a limiting value, which corresponds to the melting temperature in case of AA 7075 aluminium alloy. The workpiece surface temperatures also show a strong increase with cutting speed and are strongly affected by tool wear. For temperature measurements of chip and workpiece surfaces a fast fibre-optic two-colour pyrometer has been developed. The two-colour principle allows temperature measurements with high absolute accuracy without knowledge of the surface emissivity. Quartz fibres with small diameters enable measurements at locations with limited optical access. Additionally a high-speed infrared camera {{has been applied to}} measure temperature distributions during the chip formation in an orthogonal turning process. The temperature distributions in the primary shear zone have been evaluated, which show that material behaviour is depending on the cutting speed. The time dependent temperature distribution of the tool has been measured in an alternative experimental set-up. Temperature measurements are hardly possible at each location of interest, e. g. in the friction zone between tool and chip or in the finished workpiece subsurface layer, due to the small scales and high temperature gradients. To determine the complete temperature distribution of tool, workpiece, and chip the two-dimensional energy equation is solved numerically. A finite-volumemethod with structured grids is applied for the solution, which allows the calculation of steady-state and time dependent temperature fields. The theoretically determined distribution of the heat source terms at different locations has been corrected by a comparison of the calculated temperatures with measured values. The results show that the melting temperature of the workpiece material can be reached in the friction zones for AISI 1045 steel. Extremely high temperature gradients occur in the workpiece subsurface layer and the temperatures exceed the structural transformation temperature at which Ferrite/Pearlite changes into Austenite. The influence of the transformation enthalpy on the temperatures has also been investigated. Heat fluxes have been evaluated from the temperature fields. The heat flux into the tool decreases strongly with increasing time and is negligible for the steady state. Even for conventional speeds the heat flux into the workpiece is significantly higher than assumed in the past...|$|R

50|$|Budweiser is brewed using barley malt, rice, water, hops and yeast. It is lagered with {{beechwood}} {{chips in}} the aging vessel. While beechwood chips {{are used in}} the maturation tank, there is little to no flavor contribution from the wood, mainly because they are boiled in sodium bicarbonate soda for seven hours for the very purpose of removing any flavor from the wood. The maturation tanks that Anheuser-Busch uses are horizontal and, as such, flocculation of the yeast occurs much more quickly. Anheuser-Busch refers to this process as a secondary fermentation, with the idea being that the chips give the yeast more surface area to rest on. This is also combined with a krausening procedure that re-introduces wort into the chip tank, therefore reactivating the fermentation process. By placing the beechwood <b>chips</b> at the <b>bottom</b> of the tank, the yeast remains in suspension longer, giving it more time to reabsorb and process green beer flavors, such as acetaldehyde and diacetyl, that Anheuser-Busch believes are off-flavors which detract from overall drinkability.|$|R

40|$|A miniature, {{low-power}} broadband {{light source}} {{has been developed}} for aerospace applications, including calibrating spectrometers and powering miniature optical sensors. The initial motivation for this research was based on flight tests of a Fabry-Perot fiberoptic temperature sensor system used to detect aircraft engine exhaust gas temperature. Although the feasibility of the sensor system was proven, the commercial light source optically powering the device {{was identified as a}} critical component requiring improvement. Problems with the light source included a long stabilization time (approximately 1 hr), a large amount of heat generation, and a large input electrical power (6. 5 W). Thus, we developed a new light source to enable the use of broadband optical sensors in aerospace applications. Semiconductor chip-based light sources, such as lasers and light-emitting diodes, have a relatively narrow range of emission wavelengths in comparison to incandescent sources. Incandescent light sources emit broadband radiation from visible to infrared wavelengths; the intensity at each wavelength is determined by the filament temperature and the materials chosen for the filament and the lamp window. However, present commercial incandescent light sources are large in size and inefficient, requiring several watts of electrical power to obtain the desired optical power, and they emit {{a large percentage of the}} input power as heat that must be dissipated. The miniature light source, developed jointly by the NASA Glenn Research Center, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the Lighting Innovations Institute, requires one-fifth the electrical input power of some commercial light sources, while providing similar output light power that is easily coupled to an optical fiber. Furthermore, it is small, rugged, and lightweight. Microfabrication technology was used to reduce the size, weight, power consumption, and potential cost-parameters critical to future aerospace applications. This chip-based light source has the potential for monolithic fabrication with on-chip drive electronics. Other uses for these light sources are in systems for vehicle navigation, remote sensing applications such as monitoring bridges for stress, calibration sources for spectrometers, light sources for space sensors, display lighting, addressable arrays, and industrial plant monitoring. Two methods for filament fabrication are being developed: wet-chemical etching and laser ablation. Both yield a 25 -mm-thick tungsten spiral filament. The proof-of-concept filament shown was fabricated with the wet etch method. Then it was tested by heating it in a vacuum chamber using about 1. 25 W of electrical power; it generated bright, blackbody radiation at approximately 2650 K. The filament was packaged in Glenn's clean-room facilities. This design uses three chips vacuum-sealed with glass tape. The <b>bottom</b> <b>chip</b> consists of a reflective film deposited on silicon, the middle chip contains a tungsten filament bonded to silicon, and the top layer is a transparent window.

40|$|System {{integration}} {{technologies have}} increasingly become a strategic enabler {{for the entire}} economy and an important factor for suppliers and users of electronic products. Faced with the rapid development of the IC technology the traditional packaging is changing into a complex system integration technique to satisfy the growing demand in terms of increased functionality, performance and miniaturization. Electronic systems are used in broad application areas such as e. g., information & communication, computing, automotive and consumer. New applications are arising {{in the field of}} health monitoring, security, etc [...] The functionality of future systems can be considerably enlarged by the integration of mechanical, optical and biological functions. This requires the integration of electrical and non-electrical (sensor-, actuator-) functions. These so called Hetero Systems have to create adequate interfaces for the different application scenarios. The realization of Hetero Systems requires new architectures, new components and new system integration technologies as well. Therefore the progresses in nano- and microelectronics, microsystem technologies, bioelectronics and photonics are important factors. Hetero System Integration will be able to combine devices and components originating from different technologies for sensing, electrical signal and data processing, wireless communication, power conversion and storage. The Hetero System Integration concept is also particularly gaining importance due to the shorter time to market cycle and a high degree of flexibility at lower cost and risk assessment. The ITRS roadmap as well as technical roadmaps from other organizations (e. g. iNEMI, Jisso, Jeita) predict the increasing importance of System in Package (SiP) and 3 D integration technologies on different levels. The ability to integrate further electronic devices on silicon wafers is a decisive criterion for further development of wafer level packaging technologies (WLP). Examples are the integration of passive components (resistors, capacitors, inductors, etc.) and embedding of active devices. Advanced electronic systems, e. g. 3 D image processors and systems with integrated sensors, processors, ASIC´s, memories, radio interface (e. g. e Grain), are driven by performance enhancement and miniaturization. Three-dimensional integration technologies will be used to overcome the performance bottleneck which result from the predicted ?fundamental wiring crisis? caused by signal propagation delay. The "highly minaturized sonsor nodes" of Fraunhofer IZM "eGrain concept" attempts to link all types of system integration techniques and represents a full value chain from microelectronics and microsystems. These tiny atonomous sensor nodes require the integration of devices from different technologies e. g. MEMS sensors, radio interface, DSP and power sources. The relaization of these ultra-miniaturized self-sufficient wireless sensor nodes requires heterogeneous technologies on different levels including e. g. advanced assembly and interconnection technoloogies, integration of passive devices, thin circuit device and sensor integration, flexible functional substrate and 3 D vertical integration at wafer level. The presentation will discuss Wafer Level System integration Approaches with focus on vertical system integration (VSI), which is characterized by very high dense vertical inter-chip wiring with freeliy positioned through-Si vias (TSV). The corresponding fabrication is based on via-formationand metallization, thinning and adjusted bonding of completely processed device wafers. The so-called ICV-SLID concept is based on the bonding of top <b>chips</b> to a <b>bottom</b> wafer by very thin soldering layers (e. g. Cu/Sn). Alternative micro-bumps (e. g. SnAg) are used as well. The required underbump metallization (UBM) has to be chosen with respect to the intermetallic compound (IMC) formation. The through-Si vias are fully processed - etched and metallised - prior to the thinning sequence, with the advantage that the later stacking of the separate known good dice to the bottom device wafer is the final step of the 3 D integration process flow. As a fully modular concept, the VSI approach allows the formation of multiple device stacks with a very high via interconnect density...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of biotechnological production processes depends on selecting the best performing biocatalyst and the optimal operation conditions. Thus, during the screening and process development phases, many experiments {{have to be}} conducted, which conflicts with the demand to speed up drug development processes. This conflict is addressed, for example, by the fiber-optic online-monitoring system BioLector which utilizes the wells of shaken microtiter plates (MTPs) as small-scale fermenters. In this thesis, the BioLector technology is enhanced by incorporating microfluidic bioprocess control in design-optimized, baffled MTPs. Today, shaken MTPs are the preferred vessels for microbial cultivations in high throughput. Although, oxygen transfer in shaken bioreactors is often insufficient, this problem can generally be addressed {{by the introduction of}} baffles. Therefore, the focus {{of this study is to}} investigate how baffling affects the oxygen transfer in MTPs. On a 48 -well plate scale, 30 different cross-section geometries of MTP wells were studied. It could be shown that the introduction of baffles into the circular cylinder of a MTP well doubles the maximum oxygen transfer capacity (OTRmax), resulting in values above 100 mmol/L/h (kLa > 600 1 /h). To also guarantee a high volume for microbial cultivation, it is important to maximize the filling volume applicable during orbital shaking. Additionally, the liquid height at the well bottom was examined, which is a decisive parameter for online measurement by the BioLector. Ultimately, a six-petal flower-shape was identified as the optimal well geometry. Up to now, the geometry of baffles has neither been standardized, nor has their influence on hydrodynamics and cultivation conditions been systematically described. However, in this work a novel correlation was established by relating the measured values of OTRmax and filling height to the corresponding perimeter of the well cross-section area. This correlation systematically showed the influence of baffles in shaken vessels. Furthermore, it allows one to define the perimeter of the well cross-section area as the actual criterion for the so-called “degree of baffling”. Additionally, a maximum baffling degree can be identified which should not be exceeded in order to avoid irregular liquid behavior and a decrease in the OTRmax. Consequently, this perimeter criterion provides a helpful tool to describe different baffle geometries and design new baffles. In industrial-scale biotechnological processes, the active control of the pH-value combined with the controlled feeding of substrate solutions (fed-batch) is the standard cultivation strategy. On the contrary, for small-scale cultivations, much simpler batch experiments with no process control are performed. This conflict between the scales often hinders researchers to scale up and scale down fermentation experiments. While small-scale batches are typically performed in high throughput, large-scale cultivations demand sophisticated equipment for process control. Currently, there is no technical system on the market that solves this conflict and realizes complete process control in high throughput. The novel concept of the microfermentation system described in this work combines the BioLector system together with microfluidic control of cultivation processes in volumes below 1 mL. To achieve this, in cooperation with the Institute for Materials in Electrical Engineering 1 of the RWTH Aachen University, a concept was developed in which microfluidic <b>chips</b> replace the <b>bottom</b> of conventional MTPs. The suitability of this system has been proven by pH-controlled and fed-batch fermentations of Escherichia coli in the microfluidic MTPs. Thereby, the aim was to establish a novel technology but simultaneously to focus on their use in routine laboratory work. Therefore, ready-to-use culture devices and user-friendly actuator hardware have been developed. Moreover, the scale-up potential of this system has been shown by obtaining equivalent fermentation results compared to a 1 L laboratory-scale stirred tank reactor. The developed microfermentation system combines four advantages: (1) improved microbioreactor design by applying the baffled MTPs, (2) microfluidic process control in disposable MTPs, (3) user-friendly system for connecting the microfluidic MTP to the pneumatic actuator hardware, (4) advanced online-monitoring by the BioLector technology. Integrating the aforementioned properties into one system allows microfluidic MTPs to be used as disposable, ready-to-use cultivation vessels in a user-friendly, “plug-and-cultivate” microfermentation system. This technology narrows the gap between microscale and production scale, since it allows scalable, fully controlled and fully monitored fermentations in working volumes below 1 milliliter. In conclusion, the developed system is a valuable tool for meaningful screening and process development...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{evolution}} of electronics industry {{has made the}} adoption of high performance chips more urgent. In fact, those chips cannot be used unless high temperature die attach materials and methods are available. The conventional die attach methods typically require a processing temperature 20 - 30 °C above the melting temperature of bonding material, which melts and reacts with to-be–bonded parts to form the bonding joint. For high temperature applications (> 400 °C), the processing temperature will sharply increase along with the increased melting temperature to reach the molten phase. However, such high processing temperature will damage nearly all electronic components. To respond to such challenge, the metal bonding {{is considered to be}} a possible solution. In this dissertation, the solid-state bonding technique is employed for various bonding designs by electroplating Ag-based and In-based systems as bonding media. No molten phase or flux is involved. For most cases, the bonding conditions are conducted at 300 °C with 6. 89 MPa (1, 000 psi) pressure for a dwell time of 3 min in vacuum. The bonding time, 3 min, is constrained by the furnace. It is worth mentioning that this pressure is less than 10 % of what is used in industrial thermo-compression processes. To begin with, silver (Ag) was chosen as a bonding medium because of its exceptional properties and reasonable price. There are two designs for the Ag layer. For the first design, the 50 μm Ag layer plated on the copper (Cu) substrate is initially annealed at 400 °C for 5 h to increase Ag grain sizes, thereby making it easier to deform during bonding. For the second design, the 10 μm Ag layer is plated on the substrate and followed another 5 μm Ag with cavities. The fundamental concept is to release the thermal induced stress by creating cavities in the Ag layer to allow easier plastic deformation for the bonding medium. The resulting Ag layers are then bonded to the Cu chips. For both designs, all samples are bonded well and pass MIL-STD- 883 J method 2019. 9. The Ag layer is also applied to the Cu wire bonding. To overcome Cu oxidation issue, the bonding surface on the 1 mm Cu wire is plated a 50 μm Ag layer. An annealing step is followed to facilitate the Ag layer easier to deform and conform to the Cu or Si bonding surfaces. In-plane pull test and vertical pull test are performed to measure the breaking force of the wire bonds. For wire-bonds made on the Cu substrate, the breaking forces on in-plane pull test are greater than 20 kg. The breaking forces on vertical pull test are approximately one-half of in-plane pull test results. For wire-bonds made on Si chip, breaking forces are approximately 80 % of those made on Cu substrate. Next, the novel method is to bond the Si chips to Cu substrates directly. This structure design can provide low-resistance paths for electricity and heat. There is no specific joint used in between. The basic concept is to provide room for Cu and Si to deform without restriction by producing trenches inside the Cu substrate. When the bond between two surfaces is formed, the trenches inside the Cu substrate could release the part of thermal stress from the coefficient of thermal expansion CTE mismatch. Therefore, the bond could deal with the large CTE mismatch between Si (3 ppm/°C) and Cu (17 ppm/°C). The cross-sectional images show that the Si chips are well bonded to the Cu substrates without visible voids and cracks. After the bonding process, the simple shear tests are conducted to evaluate the bond strength, while the Si chips are all broken first. It demonstrates that the bond is stronger than the Si chip itself. Finally, the Ag-rich Ag-In solid solution layers have successfully developed on Si and silicon carbide (SiC) chips. Ag has definite advantages among metals, but it still has its own weaknesses, which can actually or potentially lead to failure. That is Ag can be tarnished not only when exposed to certain corrosive gases such as hydrogen sulfide or sulfur gas but also under normal atmospheric conditions for a long period of time. Ag-In solid solution is further studied while Ag-In binary system has been demonstrated with an exceptional anti-tarnish property. To fabricate the single phase Ag-In solid solution, the Ag/In/Ag multilayers are electroplated on the <b>chips.</b> Importantly, the <b>bottom</b> Ag layer is initially annealed at 350 °C to increase its grain sizes and to reduce grain boundaries, inasmuch as the reaction rate between Ag and In is subject to the microstructure of Ag layer. The In/Ag layers are followed to be plated onto Si chip. To decompose AgIn 2 and Ag 2 In, the two-step annealing process is then performed in a vacuum environment at 180 °C and 350 °C, respectively. After the bonding process, the compositions of resulting joints are measured by SEM/EDX, which is a homogeneous Ag-rich Ag-In solid solution. In this study, five different bonding designs are reported. All bonds made between the chips and the substrates are fabricated at relatively low processing temperatures. The bonding structures are designed to be used for high operating temperatures. The results are encouraging. These novel methods may bring a chance for those who need die-attach materials for high performance electronic devices under severe environmental conditions in industries...|$|R
