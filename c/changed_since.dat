5|$|In 1815 the Congress of Vienna fully re-established Swiss {{independence}} and the European powers agreed to permanently recognise Swiss neutrality. Swiss troops still served foreign governments until 1860 when they fought in the Siege of Gaeta. The treaty also allowed Switzerland to increase its territory, with the admission of the cantons of Valais, Neuchâtel and Geneva. Switzerland's borders have not <b>changed</b> <b>since,</b> except for some minor adjustments.|$|E

5|$|The {{state of}} Illinois created Route98 in 1924; the {{original}} route connected several cities in western Illinois.

5|$|Brookwood {{station on}} the former LSWR line (now the South Western Main Line and the Alton Line) is little <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the 1903 {{expansion}} and rebuilding. It remains in use both by commuters from the village which has grown {{to the north of}} the railway line, and by visitors to the cemetery to the south of the line. A small monument to the London Necropolis Railway, consisting of a short length of railway track on the former trackbed, was erected in 2007 outside the southern (cemetery-side) entrance to the station.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little had been <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the 17th century {{in terms of}} legal {{education}} or practice, except that students were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to the Bar. In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the call to the Bar was introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who had been called to the Bar at the Inn transferred to others.|$|E
5|$|If {{the protagonist}} manages to save Marie before {{defeating}} Izanami, the scene will then shift {{into a few}} months after the last scene of the true ending (and after the events of Persona 4 Arena Ultimax), where the protagonist will reappear at the Inaba train station on a visit. The protagonist will eventually meet up with his friends, who <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the last time they all met, and will head to the Dojima household, where a surprise party was set up earlier by Dojima.|$|E
5|$|The {{alignment}} of NY31E has not <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> that time; however, ownership {{of parts of}} the route has changed hands over the years. Until 1998, NY31E was state-maintained from its western terminus in Middleport to the Medina village line. On October1, 1998, ownership and maintenance of NY31E between NY271 in Middleport and the Niagara–Orleans county line was transferred from the state to Niagara County {{as part of a}} highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. This section of the route was subsequently co-designated, but not signed, as CR143 by Niagara County.|$|E

5|$|The {{resulting}} reforms {{helped shape}} the cavalry's contribution to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which was established with one cavalry division supported by two brigades of horse artillery. All would be trained for the mounted charge but would also be armed with rifles, the only major power to do so. The cavalry regiments were armed with Maxim Machine Guns, although these were replaced by Vickers Machine Guns from 1912. More than anything else, the issue of entrenching tools that were carried on the troop packhorses demonstrated how much the cavalry's doctrine had <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the Boer Wars.|$|E
5|$|With {{over one}} million units in sales, John Madden Football '93 was a {{commercial}} success. Critics awarded the game high scores and praised its updated graphics; but several reviewers complained that little had <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> John Madden Football '92. Royalties from the game funded the expansion of Blue Sky Productions, and the company's director, Paul Neurath, later commented {{that the size of}} these royalties led Electronic Arts to develop future Madden titles in-house.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to Geneva, Knox was chosen to be the {{minister}} at a new place of worship petitioned from Calvin. In the meantime, Elizabeth Bowes wrote to Knox, asking {{him to return to}} Margery in Scotland, which he did at the end of August. Despite initial doubts {{about the state of the}} Reformation in Scotland, Knox found the country significantly <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> he was carried off in the galley in 1547. When he toured various parts of Scotland preaching the reformed doctrines and liturgy, he was welcomed by many of the nobility including two future regents of Scotland, the Earl of Moray and the Earl of Mar.|$|E

5|$|Although Monroe {{had become}} one of 20th Century-Fox's biggest stars, her {{contract}} had not <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> 1950, meaning that she was paid far less than other stars of her stature and could not choose her projects or co-workers. She was also tired of being typecast, and her attempts to appear in films other than comedies or musicals had been thwarted by Zanuck, who had a strong personal dislike of her and did not think she would earn the studio as much revenue in dramas. When she refused to begin shooting yet another musical comedy, a film version of The Girl in Pink Tights, which was to co-star Frank Sinatra, the studio suspended her on January 4, 1954.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the awards in 1975, seven {{categories}} were presented: Best Novel, Best Short Fiction, Best Collection, Best Artist, Special Award—Professional, Special Award—Non-professional, and Life Achievement. Only a few categories have <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> then, and no changes have been made to the rules. 1978 saw the addition of the Convention Award, a special award given for general contributions to the genre, and the only award not given every year since the beginning. The Short Fiction award was split into Short Story and Novella awards in 1982, and in 1988 the multi-author anthologies, previously eligible for the Collection award, were split into their own Best Anthology category. No changes have been made since.|$|E
5|$|DST's {{potential}} {{to save energy}} comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada. Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light {{in the evening and}} increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, once a primary use of electricity. Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, making it hard to generalize from single studies.|$|E

5|$|In Paris, Bizet {{discovered}} the difficulties faced by young and relatively unknown composers {{trying to get}} their operas performed. Of the capital's two state-subsidised opera houses, the Opéra and the , the former offered a static repertoire in which works by foreign composers, particularly Rossini and Meyerbeer, were dominant. Even established French composers such as Gounod had difficulty getting works performed there. At the Opéra-Comique, innovation was equally rare; although more French works were performed, the style and character of most productions had hardly <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the 1830s. However, one condition of the Opéra-Comique's state funding was that from time to time it should produce one-act works by former Prix de Rome laureates. Under this provision, Bizet wrote La guzla de l'Emir, with a libretto by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré, and this went into rehearsal early in 1862.|$|E
5|$|In Tompkins County, {{the road}} was reconstructed {{as part of a}} project {{contracted}} out on August24, 1916. Work on the highway was completed in the early-to-mid-1920s, and the improved road was added to the state highway system as SH1433. The Groton–Cortland state highway did not have a posted route number until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, when hundreds of state-maintained highways were assigned a designation for the first time. SH446, SH996, and SH1433 were collectively designated as NY222, which continued east into downtown Cortland by way of locally maintained streets. The alignment of NY222 has not been <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> that time.|$|E
5|$|James J. Murakami {{supervised}} the production design. Location scouting revealed {{that many of}} the older buildings in Los Angeles had been torn down, including the entire neighborhood where Collins lived. Suburban areas in San Dimas, San Bernardino and Pasadena doubled for 1920s Los Angeles instead. The Old Town district of San Dimas stood in for Collins' neighborhood and some adjacent locales. Murakami said Old Town was chosen because very little had <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the 1920s. It was used for interiors and exteriors; the crew decorated the area with a subdued color palette to evoke feelings of comfort. For some exterior shots they renovated derelict properties in neighborhoods of Los Angeles that still possessed 1920s architecture. The crew staged {{the third floor of the}} Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles into a replica of the 1920s Los Angeles City Council chambers.|$|E
