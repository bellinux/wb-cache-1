40|$|This is {{the second}} part of the {{assessment}} of primary energy conversions of oscillating water columns (OWCs) wave energy converters. In the first part of the research work, the hydrodynamic performance of OWC wave energy converter has been extensively examined, targeting on a reliable numerical assessment method. In this part of the research work, the application of the air turbine power take-off (PTO) to the OWC device leads to a coupled model of the hydrodynamics and thermodynamics of the OWC wave energy converters, in a manner that under the wave excitation, the varying air volume due to the internal water surface motion creates a reciprocating chamber pressure (alternative positive and negative chamber pressure), whilst the chamber pressure, in turn, modifies the motions of the device and the internal water surface. To do this, the thermodynamics of the air chamber is first examined and applied by including the air compressibility in the oscillating water columns for different types of the air turbine PTOs. The developed thermodynamics is then coupled with the hydrodynamics of the OWC wave energy converters. This proposed assessment method is then applied to two generic OWC wave energy <b>converters</b> (one <b>bottom</b> fixed and another floating), and the numerical results are compared to the experimental results. From the comparison to the model test data, it can be seen that this numerical method is capable of assessing the primary energy conversion for the oscillating water column wave energy converters...|$|R
40|$|A new modular {{multilevel}} DC-DC converter (MMC) {{with high}} power density and simplified localized voltage balancing control is proposed. Converter building block and controller module are built separately considering level propagation for each row. In the proposed configuration, the converter building blocks {{with the same}} power handling capability are connected in parallel in each row. This leads to a triangular structure from top to <b>bottom.</b> <b>Converter</b> building block consists of integrated H-bridge and mutually coupled inductors whose total current is nearly ripple free. These features are shown to reduce the voltage ripple of DC-link capacitors significantly, leading to a smaller capacitance and size. An optimized control algorithm with voltage feedback PI loop is proposed, resulting in the elimination of current sensors. Thus, the overall system complexity is reduced and the cost-effectiveness is increased. Significant ripple reduction of the inductor current and capacitor voltages is observed based on the simulation and prototype of a 5 -level system. With a fully modular power stage module and localized control module, a system which has arbitrary number of level can be built by stacking the modules, thereby contributing to enhanced system redundancy...|$|R

40|$|Ocean {{renewable}} energy is abundant and worldwide {{available in the}} form of waves, currents, tides, thermal gradient, and salinity gradient. The VIVACE Converter (Vortex Induced Vibration Aquatic Clean Energy) is introduced to extract energy from a steady flow using Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV). In our early experiments on energy harnessing using VIVACE, energy density of 51 W/m 3 was achieved. Scalability of VIV and the VIVACE Converter makes it possible to harness energy even from low current speeds. Our experiments were performed in the TrSL 3 regime (2 Xl 04 - 4 Xl 04 < Re < lXl 05 - 2 Xl 05). This regime had not been explored before. A strong dependence of VIV on Reynolds number was observed. In the TrSL 3 regime, amplitude ratio (A/D) of 1. 9 was achieved for a smooth cylinder in VIV even with high damping imposed. Our VIV tests fall in the tail-end of the Griffin-plot. A/D achieved and maintained are 2 - 3 times higher than previously measured data. Our experiments showed that proximity of the VIVACE Converter to free surface reduces the range of synchronization of VIV and the A/D. Proximity to free surface introduced hysteresis due to flipping between wake states. At low gap ratio hysterisis was observed {{at both ends of the}} synchronization range. At a critical value of the Froude number, VIV is suppressed and it is attributed to change in stability of vortex shedding. At high Froude numbers and low gap ratios, the vortex formation transforms from absolute to convective instability. Our experiments showed that proximity of the VIVACE <b>Converter</b> to <b>bottom</b> boundary reduced the A/D for intermediate gap ratio (0. 6 < G/D < 3. 0), but the range of synchronization remained unaffected. For low gap ratios (G/D < 0. 6), the positive A/D reached a value of 2. Surface roughness of predetermined distribution and magnitude was added to the surface of the VIVACE cylinder in VIV. The added roughness, when designed and implemented appropriately, affects in a predetermined way the boundary layer, the separation point, the wake, the drag and lift forces, and consequently the VIV. In our experiments properly designed surface roughness increased the range of synchronization and A/D (2. 7) of VIV...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop {{mathematical}} models to explore the mixing and its related phenomena in converter bath. Specifically, first, a mathematical model of a physical model converter, which was scaled down to 1 / 6 th of a 30 t vessel, was developed in this study. A number of parameters were studied and their effects on the mixing time were recorded in a top blown converter. Second, a mathematical model for a combined top-bottom blown was built to investigate the optimization process. Then, a side tuyere was introduced in the combined top-bottom blown converter and its effects on the mixing and wall shear stress were studied. Moreover, based on the above results, the kinetic energy transfer phenomena in a real converter were investigated by applying the mathematical models. A simplified model, in which the calculation region was reduced to save calculation compared to simulations of the whole region of the converter, was used in the mathematical simulation. In addition, this method was also used in the simulation of real converters. This approach makes it possible to simulate the Laval nozzle flow jet and the cavity separately when using different turbulence models. In the top blown converter model, a comparison between the physical model and the mathematical model showed a good relative difference of 2. 5 % and 6. 1 % for the cavity depth and radius, respectively. In addition, the predicted mixing time showed a good relative difference of 2. 8 % in comparison to the experimental data. In an optimization of a combined top-bottom blown <b>converter,</b> a new <b>bottom</b> tuyere scheme with an asymmetrical configuration was found to be one of the best cases with respect to a decreased mixing time in the bath. An industrial investigation showed that the application effects of the new tuyere scheme yield a better stirring condition in the bath compared to the original case. Furthermore, the results indicated that the mixing time for a combined top-bottom-side blown converter was decreased profoundly compared to a conventional combined top-bottom blown converter. It was found that the side wall shear stress is increased by introducing side blowing, especially in the region near the side blowing plume. For a 100 t converter in real, the fundamental aspects of kinetic energy transfer from a top and bottom gas to the bath were explored. The analyses revealed that the energy transfer is less efficient when the top lance height is lowered or the flowrate is increased in the top blowing operations. However, an inverse trend was found. Namely, that the kinetic energy transfer is increased when the bottom flowrate is increased in the current bottom blowing operations. In addition, the slag on top of the bath is found to dissipate 6. 6 %, 9. 4 % and 11. 2 % for the slag masses 5, 9 and 15 t compared to the case without slag on top of the surface of the bath, respectively.   QC 20151015 </p...|$|R
