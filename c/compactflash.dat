25|$|A {{number of}} players support memory card slots, {{including}} <b>CompactFlash</b> (CF), Secure Digital (SD), and Memory Sticks. They are used to directly transfer content from external devices, and expanding the storage capacity of PMPs.|$|E
25|$|Some {{prosumer}} {{and professional}} digital cameras continued to offer <b>CompactFlash</b> (CF), either {{on a second}} card slot or as the only storage, as CF supports much higher maximum capacities and historically was cheaper for the same capacity.|$|E
25|$|The ZEN Vision has a 3.7-inch, trans-reflective VGA TFT-LCD screen. It has a {{video output}} (PAL or NTSC) port and a <b>CompactFlash</b> slot {{which can be}} used to {{transfer}} the contents to the player. An adapter for other memory card types is also available as an accessory. The ZEN Vision also supports an optional infrared remote.|$|E
50|$|USB sticks, MMCs, SDs, <b>CompactFlashes</b> {{and other}} popular {{removable}} devices {{should not be}} confused with MTDs. Although they contain flash memory, this is hidden behind a block device interface using a Flash Translation Layer.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{the format}} had a lukewarm reception, {{but it soon}} {{increased}} in popularity, especially after the licensing deal. In spring 2001, Memory Stick attained 25% market share (against <b>CompactFlash's</b> 40% and SmartMedia's 32%), up from 7% a year earlier. By May 2001, total shipment of Memory Stick units surpassed 10 million.|$|R
50|$|However the SD card, jointly-developed by Toshiba, Panasonic and SanDisk, became widely {{popular among}} {{companies}} and soon {{became the most}} popular flash format - by November 2003 it held 42% market share in the United States, ahead of <b>CompactFlash's</b> 26% and Memory Stick with 16%. Eventually Sony themselves became the only company to support the format. Sony were often criticized for the Memory Stick as they were deemed to be expensive compared to other formats.|$|R
25|$|In some cases, it is {{possible}} to interchange parts between different revisions or install third-party internal parts. For example, the iMac G3 in Bondi Blue shown below had its motherboard replaced with one from a 266MHz Grape model, while the CD-ROM drive was replaced with a <b>CompactFlash</b> memory card reader that is running Mac OS X Tiger.|$|E
25|$|Many {{personal}} computers of all types, including tablets and mobile phones, use SD cards, either through built-in slots or through an active electronic adaptor. Adaptors {{exist for the}} PC card, ExpressBus, USB, FireWire, and the parallel printer port. Active adaptors also let SD cards be used in devices designed for other formats, such as <b>CompactFlash.</b> The FlashPath adaptor lets SD cards {{be used in a}} floppy disk drive.|$|E
25|$|SD {{cards are}} not the most {{economical}} solution in devices that need {{only a small amount}} of non-volatile memory, such as station presets in small radios. They may also not present the best choice for applications that require higher storage capacities or speeds as provided by other flash card standards such as <b>CompactFlash.</b> These limitations may be addressed by evolving memory technologies, such as the world's highest capacity SanDisk Ultra 200GB Micro SD released in 2015.|$|E
25|$|The ZEN Vision W was {{released}} on September 17, 2006. A variant of the ZEN Vision, the portable media player has a 4.3-inch, widescreen (16:9) TFT-LCD display. The player comes in black and is available with 30 or 60GB capacity. Like the ZEN Vision:M, a built-in microphone and an FM tuner are included, as well as support for the same media formats, a similar graphical interface {{and the ability to}} sync organizer data from Microsoft Outlook. It also includes a <b>CompactFlash</b> reader for extra capacity and the direct upload of images.|$|E
25|$|ReadyBoost (codenamed EMD) is a disk caching {{software}} component developed by Microsoft for Windows Vista and included in later {{versions of the}} Windows operating system. ReadyBoost enables NAND memory mass storage devices, including <b>CompactFlash,</b> SD cards, and USB flash drives, {{to be used as}} a write cache between a hard drive and random access memory in an effort to increase computing performance. ReadyBoost relies on the SuperFetch technology and, like SuperFetch, adjusts its cache based on user activity. Other features, including ReadyDrive, are implemented in a manner similar to ReadyBoost.|$|E
25|$|The PS3 {{supports}} numerous SDTV and HDTV resolutions (from 480i/576i up to 1080p) and connectivity options (such as HDMI 1.3a and component video). In {{terms of}} audio, the PS3 supports {{a number of}} formats, including 7.1 digital audio, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio and others; audio output is possible over stereo RCA cables (analog), optical digital cables, or HDMI. The PS3 slim features an upgraded HDMI chip that allows bitstreaming of lossless audio codecs to an external receiver (earlier versions had to decode the signal internally before outputting it via LPCM). For the optical disc drive, {{a wide variety of}} DVD and CD formats are supported, as well as Blu-ray Discs. A 20, 40, 60, 80, 120, 160, 250, 320, or 500GB 2.5-inch SATA 150 hard disk is preinstalled. In the early 60GB and 80GB configurations, flash memory can also be used, either Memory Sticks; <b>CompactFlash</b> cards; or SD/MMC cards. All models support USB memory devices; flash drives and external hard drives are both automatically recognized. However, they must be formatted with the FAT32 file system. For communication, the system sported four USB 2.0 ports at the front on the 20 and 60GB models as well as the NTSC 80GB model, but the 40GB and 80GB PAL models only have two USB ports. All models (80 and 160GB) released after August 2008 have been reduced to two USB ports, as well as dropping <b>CompactFlash</b> and SD card support. One Gigabit Ethernet port, Bluetooth 2.0 support, and built-in Wi-Fi (except CECHBxx).|$|E
25|$|Intel Corporation saw {{the massive}} {{potential}} of the invention and introduced the first commercial NOR type flash chip in 1988. NOR-based flash has long erase and write times, but provides full address and data buses, allowing random access to any memory location. This makes it a suitable replacement for older read-only memory (ROM) chips, which are used to store program code that rarely needs to be updated, such as a computer's BIOS or the firmware of set-top boxes. Its endurance may be from as little as 100 erase cycles for an on-chip flash memory, to a more typical 10,000 or 100,000 erase cycles, up to 1,000,000 erase cycles. NOR-based flash was the basis of early flash-based removable media; <b>CompactFlash</b> was originally based on it, though later cards moved to less expensive NANDflash.|$|E
25|$|The A600 is {{the first}} of only two Amiga models to feature a PCMCIA Type II interface. This {{connector}} allows use of a number of compatible peripherals available for the laptop-computer market, though only 16-bit (Type II) PCMCIA cards are hardware-compatible; newer 32-bit CardBus or PC Card peripherals are incompatible. The port is not fully compliant with the PCMCIA Type II standard as the A600 was developed before the standard was finalized. The PCMCIA implementation on the A600 is almost identical to the one featured on a later Amiga, the 1200. A number of Amiga peripherals were released by third-party developers for this connector including SRAM cards, CD-ROM controllers, SCSI controllers, network cards, sound samplers, and video-capture devices. Although PCMCIA was similar in spirit to Commodore's expansion architecture for its earlier systems, the intended capability for convenient external expansion through this connector was largely unrealized at the time of release because of the prohibitive expense of PCMCIA peripherals for a lower-budget personal computer. Later, a number of compatible laptop-computer peripherals have been made to operate with the A600, including network cards (both wired and wireless), serial modems and <b>CompactFlash</b> adapters.|$|E
500|$|It was {{the debut}} of what was later dubbed the Windows Mobile {{operating}} system, and {{meant to be a}} successor to the operating system aboard Palm-size PCs. [...] It retained backwards compatibility with such Palm-Size PC applications. [...] Pocket PC 2000 was intended mainly for Pocket PC devices; however, several Palm-Size PC devices had the ability to be updated also. [...] While, several Pocket PC 2000 phones were released, Microsoft's smartphone hardware platform was not yet created. [...] The only resolution supported by this release was 240 x 320 (QVGA). [...] Removable storage card formats that were supported were <b>CompactFlash</b> and MultiMediaCard. [...] At this time Pocket PC devices had not been standardized with a specific CPU architecture. [...] As a result, Pocket PC 2000 was released on multiple CPU architectures; SH-3, MIPS, and ARM. Infrared (IR) File beaming capability was among the original hardware features.|$|E
2500|$|Overall, SD is less open than <b>CompactFlash</b> or USB {{flash memory}} drives. Those open {{standards}} {{can be implemented}} without paying for licensing, royalties, or documentation.

50|$|<b>CompactFlash</b> remains {{popular and}} is {{supported}} by many professional devices and high-end consumer devices. As of 2017, both Canon and Nikon use <b>CompactFlash</b> for their flagship digital still cameras. Canon also chose <b>CompactFlash</b> as the recording medium for its professional high-definition tapeless video cameras. Ikegami professional video cameras can record digital video onto <b>CompactFlash</b> cards through an adaptor.|$|E
50|$|Two {{additional}} Advanced Timing modes {{have been}} {{defined in the}} <b>CompactFlash</b> specification 2.1. Those are Multiword DMA mode 3 and Multiword DMA mode 4. They are specific to <b>CompactFlash.</b> Multiword DMA is only permitted for <b>CompactFlash</b> devices configured in True IDE mode.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>CompactFlash</b> flash-memory devices limit wear on blocks {{by varying}} the {{physical}} location {{to which a}} block is written. This process is called wear leveling. When using <b>CompactFlash</b> in ATA mode {{to take the place}} of the hard disk drive, wear leveling becomes critical because low-numbered blocks contain tables whose contents change frequently. Current <b>CompactFlash</b> cards spread the wear-leveling across the entire drive. The more advanced <b>CompactFlash</b> cards will move data that rarely changes to ensure all blocks wear evenly.|$|E
50|$|The {{interface}} {{has spawned}} a generation of flash memory cards that set out to improve on the size and features of Type I cards: <b>CompactFlash,</b> MiniCard, P2 Card and SmartMedia. For example, the PC Card electrical specification is also used for <b>CompactFlash,</b> so a PC Card <b>CompactFlash</b> adapter need only be a socket adapter.|$|E
50|$|The {{cards are}} not {{backward}} compatible with <b>CompactFlash</b> or CFast cards. XQD and CFast were both {{designed as a}} replacement of the then-16-year-old (in 2010) <b>CompactFlash</b> standard.|$|E
50|$|Two {{additional}} Advanced Timing modes {{have been}} {{defined in the}} <b>CompactFlash</b> specification 2.0. Those are PIO mode 5 and PIO mode 6. They are specific to <b>CompactFlash.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Traditional <b>CompactFlash</b> cards use the Parallel ATA interface, but in 2008, {{a variant}} of <b>CompactFlash,</b> CFast was announced. CFast (also known as CompactFast) {{is based on the}} Serial ATA interface.|$|E
50|$|A {{variant of}} <b>CompactFlash</b> known as CFast {{is based on}} the Serial ATA bus, rather than the Parallel ATA/IDE bus for which all {{previous}} versions of <b>CompactFlash</b> are designed. CFast is also known as CompactFast.|$|E
50|$|The Miniature Card format {{competed with}} SmartMedia and <b>CompactFlash</b> cards, also {{released}} during the mid-1990s, and the earlier, larger Type I PC Cards. Ultimately, <b>CompactFlash</b> and SmartMedia cards were {{more successful in}} the consumer electronics market.|$|E
5000|$|Since <b>CompactFlash</b> {{interface}} is electrically {{identical to}} the 16-bit PC Card, the <b>CompactFlash</b> form factor is also used {{for a variety of}} Input/Output and interface devices. Many standard PC cards have CF counterparts, some examples include: ...|$|E
5000|$|Some [...] "OEM Only" [...] drives use the <b>CompactFlash</b> {{form factor}} but only provide a 5 V IDE/ATA {{interface}}. These {{will not work}} in readers or devices which expect a 3.3 V interface and full <b>CompactFlash</b> functionality.|$|E
5000|$|<b>CompactFlash</b> {{cards that}} use flash memory are more rugged than some hard drive {{solutions}} {{because they are}} solid-state. (See also Reliability above.) Separately, <b>CompactFlash</b> cards are thicker than other card formats, which may render them less susceptible to breakage from harsh treatment.|$|E
