50|$|In rural areas, <b>cat</b> <b>doors</b> (often simple holes) in the walls, doors or even {{roofs of}} grain and flour storage spaces {{have long been}} used to welcome feral cats to hunt rodent pests that feed on these stores. Human semi-{{domestic}}ation of wildcats dates back to at least 7,500 BC in Cyprus, and the domestic cat {{was a part of}} everyday life in grain-dependent ancient Egypt (ca. 6,000 BC onward). Nowadays, this function is mostly lost, but in some rural areas, such as Valencia, Spain, and Vaunage, France, farm <b>cat</b> <b>doors</b> and holes (gateras, chatières) are still common.|$|R

50|$|A pet door or pet flap (also {{referred}} to in more specific terms, such as cat flap, <b>cat</b> <b>door,</b> dog door, or doggie door) is a small portal in a wall, window or human door to allow pets to enter and exit a house (or other structure) on their own without needing a person to open the door. Originally simple holes, the modern form is a hinged and often spring-loaded panel or flexible flap, and some are electronically controlled. They offer a degree of protection against wind, rain, and larger-bodied intruders entering the dwelling. Similar hatches can let dogs through fences at stiles. A related concept is the pet gate, which is easy for humans to open but acts as a secure pet barrier, {{as well as the}} automated left- or right-handed pet doors.|$|E

He also hates being mistaken for the wrong species of bird (though we are never told what species he actually is), and he is reluctant to eat thrown bread crumbs because he doesnt want anyone to think hes on welfare, and when asked about his net income by Snoopy in his census-taker persona, he replied [...] "four worms a day".

5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1985, Carol Ann Brewer {{purchased}} a polydactyl cat near Mount Baker, Washington, in the Cascade Mountains. This male had a short bobbed tail. In January 1986, she rescued another male cat. This cat was very large, had a bobbed tail, and {{was reported to have}} been sired by a bobcat. While this cat was starving, it still weighed 17 pounds, and was so tall it reached up to Brewer’s knees. Shortly after she had acquired this large male, it mated with a brown spotted female <b>cat</b> next <b>door.</b> In April 1986, a litter was born from this mating. Brewer eventually kept one of the kittens, named [...] "Pixie", and after a year started a breeding program with Pixie as the foundation cat. Over the next couple of years, Brewer introduced into her program 23 cats from around the Cascade range that were believed by her to be born from naturally occurring matings between bobcats and domestic cats. She coined the term [...] "Legend Cat" [...] to refer to such cats and has since registered a trademark in the U.S. to limit the term to describe permitted outcrosses used in her breeding program. At the same time, other breeders in the U.S. were working with distinctly wild looking barn cats and collaborated with Brewer to establish a broad genetic base and to develop the foundation of today's Pixie-bob.|$|R
50|$|Porky then chases the {{cat with}} the shotgun until the cat sings Rock-a-Bye Baby, which lulls Porky to sleep.

Porky locks down the window, but the <b>cat</b> reopens the <b>door</b> and sings Jeepers Creepers. Porky chases him out again, only for the cat to slam the door open into Porky before shutting it behind him. When the cat is outside singing Make Love With a Guitar, Porky grabs his gun and shoots the cat, who manages to gasp out a chorus of Aloha 'Oe, and dies.

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{traces of}} sculpture in Denmark {{date from the}} 12th century when a stonemason known as Horder {{was active in the}} east of Jutland and on the island of Funen decorating churches, especially doors and fonts. From roughly the same period, there are sculpted figures in the granite reliefs depicting the Removal from the Cross in the tympanum above the so-called <b>Cat's</b> Head <b>Door</b> of Ribe Cathedral. In the early 16th century, sculpted altarpieces and pulpits were produced by German artists such as Claus Berg working in Odense Cathedral and Hans Brüggemann who designed the unpainted altarpiece in Schleswig Cathedral. However the Reformation in 1536 brought such decorative work to an almost total stop. During the Renaissance period, sculptors from abroad were the source of work in Denmark. The Flemish sculptor Cornelis Floris from Antwerp produced tombs for Herluf Trolle and Birgitte Gøye (1566-68) in Herlufsholm and for Christian III (1569-79) in Roskilde Cathedral. Gert van Groningen was one of the leading Dutch artists to participate in the design of Kronborg's main entrance. Another Flemish sculptor active {{towards the end of the}} 16th century in Denmark was Gert van Egen who designed Frederik II's tomb in Roskilde Cathedral. Similarly, in the 17th century, it was Adriaen de Vries who designed the Neptunus Fountain for Frederiksberg Palace (1615-22) although it was later taken by the Swedes as a prize of war and now stands before Drottningholm Palace.|$|R

He raps on the door and wakes up Tom, who {{promptly}} opens the door, only to find no one there. He walks out into the cold; however, Jerry sneaked in under the <b>cat</b> and the <b>door</b> closes on Tom. Tom soon gets cold and does everything he can to stay warm. Tom then peeks through the window and sees Jerry making a fire. His grin is invidious. He tries to enter through the chimney, but Jerry happens to have chosen that moment to light the fire.

50|$|In Monty Gets the Chop Monty {{was still}} {{accident}} prone with his glasses so Simon and Josie decided to record his accidents {{and threatened to}} give him the chop if he had three mishaps in one day. Monty had two accidents that day and worrying {{that they were going to}} chop off his head he stayed in his basket and hardly dared to move. Mrs Sprod cooked too much so she let Monty have the extra meat chop. In Monty's picnic the Sprod family were going to the seaside. When they stopped for petrol Monty sneaked out to the picnic hamper on top of the car to eat the mince pies. The car started again whilst Monty was still in the hamper and he got sick. When the Sprod family realised Monty was gone they screeched to a halt and Monty was hurled out though he was not hurt but the picnic was ruined. In Monty and the <b>Cat</b> Next <b>Door</b> Monty was jealous at the attention Gertrude the cat was getting next door so he sneaked up behind her to give her a surprise. Monty barked and Gertrude got through the gate but Monty got his head stuck. A woman released him by putting margarine behind his ears. In Monty and the School Fête Simon and Josie were not having luck selling Monty souvenirs at their school fête. A gust of wind blew away the headmistresses hat but Monty caught it. Everyone was impressed by this and bought Monty souvenirs. Mrs Prendlethorpe was annoyed at the damage to her hat but was pleased that Simon and Josie raised lots of money. In Monty's Mistake Mrs Sprod and the children talked about putting Mr Sprod on a diet and Monty though they were talking about him. Monty then did exercises around the garden to prove he was fit to the bemusement of the Sprod family.|$|R
60|$|The Prince {{met them}} joyfully, {{and they began}} to tell him all their adventures; but he managed to hide from them what he had been doing, and even led them to think that a turnspit dog which he had with him was the one he was {{bringing}} for the King. Fond as they all were of one another, the two eldest could not help being glad to think that their dogs certainly had a better chance. The next morning they started in the same chariot. The elder brothers carried in baskets two such tiny, fragile dogs that they hardly dared to touch them. As for the turnspit, he ran after the chariot, and got so covered with mud that one could hardly see what he was like at all. When they reached the palace everyone crowded round to welcome them as they went into the King's great hall; and when the two brothers presented their little dogs nobody could decide which was the prettier. They were already arranging between themselves to share the kingdom equally, when the youngest stepped forward, drawing from his pocket the acorn the White Cat had given him. He opened it quickly, and there upon a white cushion they saw a dog so small that it could easily have been put through a ring. The Prince laid it upon the ground, and it got up at once and began to dance. The King {{did not know what to}} say, for it was impossible that anything could be prettier than this little creature. Nevertheless, as he was in no hurry to part with his crown, he told his sons that, as they had been so successful the first time, he would ask them to go once again, and seek by land and sea for a piece of muslin so fine that it could be drawn through the eye of a needle. The brothers were not very willing to set out again, but the two eldest consented because it gave them another chance, and they started as before. The youngest again mounted the wooden horse, and rode back at full speed to his beloved White <b>Cat.</b> Every <b>door</b> of the castle stood wide open, and every window and turret was illuminated, so it looked more wonderful than before. The hands hastened to meet him, and led the wooden horse off to the stable, while he hurried in to find the White Cat. She was asleep in a little basket on a white satin cushion, but she very soon started up when she heard the Prince, and was overjoyed at seeing him once more.|$|R

After swimming in the lake, they light a campfire, and share a cannabis joint. An act of blowbacking the joint leads the two to share a kiss and they proceed to make love. Emily wakes up the following morning to find Naomi preparing to leave. She pleads with Naomi not to leave her a second time and tells her that she should accept {{that she needs to}} be loved. Naomi goes home to find Kieran in bed with her mother, and leaves for college, devastated. She sees her teachers rigging the election to prevent Cook from winning, and reveals this to the form when she is announced the winner. As his first presidential act, Cook starts a riot. In the ensuing chaos, Naomi forgives Kieran, encouraging him that if he likes her mother, he should tell her so. Naomi begins to have sex with Cook before she realises that it [...] "isn't right". Surprisingly, Cook doesn't seem to mind, as he says that she must have a good reason not to follow through because she's clever. Naomi leaves, with her and Cook now sharing a better understanding of each other. That night, she visits Emily's house, but Emily refuses to open the door, not wanting Naomi to see her after she had been crying. They sit {{on opposite sides of the}} door, and Naomi admits that she does need somebody to love her. Emily offers her hand through the <b>door's</b> <b>cat</b> flap to Naomi, who finally reciprocates Emily's feelings.|$|R
50|$|Stories {{collected}} in Pranamya Devata presenting to us modern versions of eleven Rudras {{can be placed}} in the category of the narrated type which exploit dramatization to the full for humorous and satirical effects. The debate whether they are stories or otherwise is most unfounded. They are stories of character, and of the same order as The Luncheon or Mr. Know-all. Prof. Jha calls them “satirical sketches” which have their western counterparts, at least in respect of their social purpose, in the pen-pictures of various types of men and women - the hypocrite, the Milkmaid, the Dull Physician, a young Raw Preacher etc - drawn by early 17th century essayists like Hall, Overbury, Earle, Dekker, Fuller and others. Inspired by Theophrastus and influenced largely by Seneca and the dramatists, especially Ben Jonson’s Comedy of Humours, these writers made the ‘character’ a favourite form of description and satire. In fact, Prof. Jha did {{more or less the same}} thing in his stories as they did in their essays. The vogue of such character portrayal was continued by the 18th century periodical essayists like Addison, Steele and Oliver Goldsmith. Prof. Jha shares with them the general purpose of their essays which was “to expose the false arts of life, to pull off the disguise of cunning, vanity and affectation, and to recommend a general simplicity in dress, discourse and behaviour”. More than an album or portrait gallery, Pranamya Devata is a ‘menagerie’ of one short of a dozen odd creatures vying for supremacy. The book is dedicated to one whom the author considers to be the supreme contender, but the readers may have their own pick. We have quite an assortment of funny characters in a foursome of queer, gluttonous guests unscrupulously callous to the inconvenience of the host (Vikat Pahun/ Odd Guests); a greedy, newly-wed young man who wants to show off at the cost of his poor father-in-law (Adarsh Kutumb/An Ideal Relation); a poor, pitiable husband who is compelled to live with his affluent in-law and is subsequently reduced to the status of a domestic servant (Ghar Jamai/Living with In-law); an illiterate, uncouth southern Brahmin who cannot even pronounce correctly the name of his culturally superior wife (Bhadeshak Namoona/Sample from the Off-country); and an anglicized fop whose discomfiture reminds one of Khushwant Singh’s Karma (Angrejia Babu / An Anglicized Youth). There is also a poet, or a poetaster rather, with a vast gap between his practice and precept in Kaviji (The Poet). The professed emancipator of woman turns out to be a jealous husband, and the revolutionary poet shows his real skin when a <b>cat</b> rattles the <b>door</b> at night. Likewise, there are an orthodox theologian, a hypocrite astrologer, an avaricious pundit, and the leech of an insurance agent who would pursue one to the underworld to get a deal. Together they complete the social scenario of the Mithila of Prof. Jha’s time. These stories combine entertainment with enlightenment at a level of literary accomplishment and cultural sensitivity.|$|R
