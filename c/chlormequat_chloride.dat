40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Experiments were {{conducted}} {{to determine the effect}} of environment and several plant growth regulators on the physiology, quality, and agronomic performance of snap beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The potassium salts of naphthenic acid and cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, received particular attention. Application of potassium naphthenate solutions to the foliage of 14 -day-old wheat seedlings caused significant reductions in height for the first 4 weeks after treatment. Reductions were observed in water-soluble sugars in the shoots and roots. Accompanying increases in water-soluble protein and free amino acids were measured in the shoots. No significant effect on amino acid levels was noted in the roots but increases were observed in soluble protein. The reductions in sugars and increases in proteins and amino acids indicate a shunting of carbon skeletons from carbohydrate to nitrogen metabolism. Under field conditions, 2 -chloroethylphosphonic acid (ethephon) and(2 -chloroethyl) trimethylammonium <b>chloride</b> (<b>chlormequat)</b> regardless of rate or time of application produced significant reductions in wheat plant height. Ethephon was more effective in height reduction than chlormequat. Potassium cyclohexanecarboxylate and potassium naphthenate in many cases significantly increased the length of the uppermost internodes. Differential wheat cultivar response to growth regulator application was evident with the exception of plant height and associated measurements which were similar between cultivars with a given regulator. Changes in grain nutritional quality components exemplify these differential responses. Vitamin content was generally lowered by potassium naphthenate, and potassium naphthenate and potassium cyclohexanecarboxylate lowered the mineral content of the grain. Individual quality components appeared to be affected independently. No significant increase in snap bean yield resulted from regulator treatments in the field. Protein content was significantly increased in spring-planted snap bean pods by at least one rate of all the regulators studied with the exception of potassium cyclohexancarboxylate which lowered protein. Several growth regulators produced significant increases of B-carotene content in summerplanted snap beans whereas, ascorbic acid was significantly reduced by all applications in the spring but not in the summer planting. Controlled environment experiments where high temperature and low relative humidity were imposed had little effect on pod protein and B-carotene content. In contrast, ascorbic acid content was drastically reduced the first day after exposure to stress conditions. Though plants tended to adjust to their new growing conditions, after 5 days they had not reached levels of ascorbic acid found in unstressed control plants. Treatment with potassium naphthenate tended to lower levels more and retard adjustment to the higher temperatures. Nutritional quality in snap bean pods appeared to be affected more by the prevailing environmental conditions near harvest even though yield varied greatly between cultivars {{and to a lesser extent}} between dates of planting. Ascorbic acid content appears to be more sensitive to seasonal fluctuation in environment than B-carotene or protein content, as large variations in ascorbic acid content between planting dates were evident.

40|$|Abstract It {{appears that}} the risk of crop {{production}} under dry land conditions would be increased due to climate change in the next future decades. Recently, because of in most dryland regions, water use efficiency (WUE) is low due to undesirable production management. Water stress affects many physiological processes, involved in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield formation. In order to improve economy of water use, regulation of root and shoot growth is important. In this study effects of different levels of nitrogen fertilizer and plant growth retardant (<b>Chlormequat</b> <b>Chloride)</b> on grain, phytomass yield and WUE of four rainfed wheat cultivars were examined in a field experiment during 2006 - 07 and 2007 - 08 growing seasons in College of Agriculture, Shiraz University located in Badjgah. The results showed that differences between cultivars for grain yield, phytomass and WUE were significant. Effects of <b>chlormequat</b> <b>chloride</b> and nitrogen on grain and phytomass yield were significant. In the first year the highest grain yield and phytomass production (192. 4 and 431. 2 g/m 2, respectively) were obtained from Nicknejad cultivar, <b>Chlormequat</b> <b>Chloride</b> application and using 80 kg/ha nitrogen, and in the second years from Azar- 2 cultivar (121. 5 and 333. 5 g/m 2, respectively). <b>Chlormequat</b> <b>chloride</b> and nitrogen had significant effects on WUE in both years. Interaction of <b>chlormequat</b> <b>chloride</b> and 80 kg/ha nitrogen application in both years on WUE were significant (0. 95 and 2. 35 g/m 2 /mm, respectively). It appeared that nitrogen and <b>chlormequat</b> <b>chloride</b> application with increase root expansion and proliferation improved soil water uptake. It might be recommended that selecting resistant cultivars to later season drought stress, together with application of <b>chlormequat</b> <b>chloride</b> and nitrogen fertilizer have beneficial effects on increase of WUE of rainfall and could improve wheat grain yield under rainfed conditions.

40|$|Seed grown dahlias lack {{uniformity}} of growth habit and are particularly erratic bloomers. This {{results in a}} wide range of seed maturities within a plant and creates major problems for seed harvest. In an attempt to reduce the spread of flowering and improve uniformity, crop manipulation by hand pinching and the application of three plant growth regulators was investigated in field grown dahlia (Dahlia hybrida) cvs. Unwins Dwarf Mixture and Figaro White. In 1987 / 88 the effects of pinching above nodes 3, 4 and 5 on flowering pattern, flower production and seed yield of dahlia cv. Unwins Dwarf Mixture were determined. Pinching had no effect on the number of flowers per plant or total flowering period. However pinching did shorten the days from first to peak flowering because of increased {{uniformity of}} lateral branch growth. Pinching above node 4 increased harvested seed yield by 40 % and cleaned seed yield by 32 % but only the former result was significant. Although pinching above node 4 also produced more seedheads per plant and seeds per seedhead than in non-pinched plants, differences were once again non-significant. In the following season (1988 / 89) two rates of three plant growth regulators (PGRs) were applied at two growth stages (i. e. paclobutrazol 0. 5 and 1. 0 kg a. i. ha- 1, daminozide 2. 0 and 4. 0 kg a. i. ha- 1, <b>chlormequat</b> <b>chloride</b> 1. 5 and 3. 0 kg a. i. ha- 1 at visible terminal bud stage and stem elongation) to plants of two cultivars, Unwins Dwarf Mixture (multicolour, 70 cm tall) and Figaro White (white, 30 - 35 cm tall) to determine their effects on plant growth and development, flowering pattern, seed yield and yield components. Hand pinching above node 4 was also included as a treatment for comparison. In cv. Unwins Dwarf Mixture, hand pinching increased lateral branch length and promoted simultaneous flowering, but did not significantly increase seed yield or any of its components. All three PGR's retarded growth initially, but these effects mostly did not persist past first flowering. Flowering duration or flower numbers did not alter following PGR application, and so a high variation in seed maturation was still present in all plots. However two PGR treatments, paclobutrazol (1. 0 kg a. i. ha- 1) applied at the first visible bud stage, and <b>chlormequat</b> <b>chloride</b> (1. 5 kg a. i. ha- 1) applied at the stem elongation stage significantly increased seed yield. The response to paclobutrazol came from an increased number of seeds per seedhead and greater uniformity of seedhead development, which reduced the seed loss during cleaning (from 44 to 11 %). The reason for the seed yield increase following chlormequat application was not clear, as yield components did not differ significantly, but more seedheads per plant were recorded. In the dwarf cultivar Figaro White, PGRs did not increase seed yield. Retardation effects were transitory. Seed yield of this cultivar was very low because of poor seed setting in all treatments and it is suggested that white petal colour is unattractive to insect pollinators. Response to PGRs is application rate and time dependent. Results from the previous trial suggested that paclobutrazol application could be more effective if applied earlier, whereas for <b>chlormequat</b> <b>chloride,</b> later application (i. e, at or after stem elongation) may be more appropriate. However, paclobutrazol application at the vegetative stage did not affect seed yield, and as in the previous experiment, seed yield was increased following application at the visible bud stage only. <b>Chlormequat</b> <b>chloride</b> applied at stem elongation also increased harvested seed yield but not cleaned seed yield, presumably as a result of loss of immature/light seed. Because of the diversity of seed maturation, optimum harvest time is difficult to judge in dahlia grown for seed. Reproductive growth and development were monitored in glasshouse grown plants of cv. Unwins Dwarf Mixture, and the sequence of seed development determined in flowers produced on plants growing from tubers left in the field from a previous trial. Seed yield was most strongly related to seedhead numbers rather than seed numbers or weight, and thus the uniformity of seedhead maturation is important for a high yield of quality seed. Although the total flowering period was over two months (from 66 - 132 days after sowing (DAS)), around 80 % of the total flowers produced were formed between 75 - 96 DAS. Each seedhead needed 33 days from first flower opening to reach seed physiological maturity, and seed could remain in the seedhead for a further 9 days before shedding began. Thus the optimum harvest time was between 33 - 42 days after first flowering (or 120 - 129 DAS) because during this time the maximum number of mature seedheads was recorded, seed had reached full viability, and seed shedding had not begun. Once seedheads opened, seed moisture fell rapidly (from 40 to 14 % in 3 days) and seed was completely shed by 54 DAF. Delaying harvest until 60 days after peak flowering (DAPF) produced the greatest harvested seed yield in untreated plants because of the continued ripening of green seedheads. However, after cleaning, seed yield at 60 DAPF did not differ from that at 42 DAPF because of greater cleaning losses (43 cf. 27 %). In addition, seed sprouting in the seedhead was observed by 54 DAPF. When harvested at 42 DAPF both paclobutrazol and <b>chlormequat</b> <b>chloride</b> significantly increased seed yield, but cleaning losses were high in <b>chlormequat</b> <b>chloride</b> treated plants. PGR's did not delay seed maturity, so that as seed harvest was delayed any PGR yield advantage tended to disappear. PGR treatments did not affect thousand seed weight or germination. <b>Chlormequat</b> <b>chloride</b> applied at 1. 5 kg a. i. ha- 1 at the stem elongation stage increased secondary lateral branch production and hence the number of flower sites, while paclobutrazol applied at 1. 0 kg a. i. ha- 1 at the first visible bud stage increased flowers, seedheads and/or seeds per seedhead over that of control plants. However, dahlia plants did not appear to be capable of supporting the extra number of seeds through to maturation; cleaned seed yield was not always increased because light seed was cleaned out of the seed lot. For dahlia seed production it may be more effective to try and achieve increased inter-plant uniformity by growing at very high density, rather than trying to achieve this effect through chemical manipulation. This idea is briefly discussed...|$|E

Both PGR were sprayed to cotton at pin-head square at 15 g ha- 1 a. i. with and without a silicon-based adjuvant, and simulated rains were applied at 0, 0. 75, 1. 5, 3. 0, 6. 0, 12. 0 and 24 hours after spraying, plus a control without rainfall. Addition of silicon adjuvant increased PGR uptake. Rainfall occurring up to 24 hours after spraying resulted in some PGR loss from cotton leaves, mainly {{in the absence of the}} adjuvant. The decreased uptake implies that in order to achieve the desired level of growth reduction, at least a fraction of the original PGR rate should be reapplied...|$|E

CNPA ITA 90 constituiu o objetivo do presente trabalho. O experimento foi conduzido no ano agrícola de 1998 / 99 no Município de Primavera do Leste, MT. Foram estudados 15 tratamentos com quatro repetições, utilizando-se o delineamento experimental de blocos casualizados. A altura das plantas com a aplicação parcelada foi 24 % menor em relação à testemunha, independentemente do produto estudado. O peso do capulho foi maior com a aplicação de regulador de crescimento, e não dependeu do produto e do esquema de aplicação. O peso de 100 sementes depende da seqüência de aplicação e do produto utilizado; nos tratamentos em que as duas primeiras aplicações foram com cloreto de chlormequat, o peso de 100 sementes foi maior. Não houve efeito significativo dos reguladores de crescimento na porcentagem de fibras; entretanto, a produtividade de fibras foi influenciada pelo produto e pelo esquema de parcelamento; com três e duas aplicações do mesmo produto, a maior produtividade foi obtida com cloreto de mepiquat.

40|$|Our {{object is}} to develop a method for the public {{approval}} and re-evaluation of pesticides that emphasises a wide evaluation of social benefits. This is done through the case for the three plant-growth regulators approved for use in Norwegian grain production at present: <b>chlormequat</b> <b>chloride,</b> ethephon and trinexapacethyl. A multicriteria method is founded on the premises for an expert based model as opposed to e. g. a market based model. It seems to be a possible method that allows for the use of several incommensurable criteria in the approval process by National Agricultural Inspection Service (NAIS). Furthermore, it results in greater transparency, which may be an important quality in a public decision process. However, there are problems connected to a social benefit evaluation like this, some of these are: • There may be other criteria that also should be included • Effects outside the agricultural sector are not considered The environmental effect and the health effect are estimated by NAIS, while a model for estimation of the economic margin is developed in this project.

40|$|Orchids {{have become}} an {{important}} portion of the international floriculture market.   Arundina graminifolia is a terrestrial orchid that produces attractive flowers, and, although the species could be a potential candidate for the floriculture market, its considerable height {{makes it difficult to}} transport and commercialize.   A number of plant growth regulators have been utilized to control plant height in ornamentals and other species.   Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficiency of growth regulators, paclobutrazol and <b>chlormequat</b> <b>chloride</b> on the vegetative development of containerized A. graminifolia orchid aiming at height control.   Paclobutrazol (Cultar) was applied at 0, 5, 10, and 20 mg L- 1, and CCC (Cycocel) was applied at 0, 2000, 4000, and 6000 mg L- 1. The plants were assessed monthly for the plant height and number of shoots per container. CCC had no effect on the final height of plants at the concentrations applied. In contrast, paclobutrazol was effective in controlling plant height at a concentration of 5 mg L- 1, but higher concentrations (10 and 20 mg L- 1) proved to be toxic to the plants, causing death to the new shoots. Paclobutrazol at lower concentrations offers a viable means for height control in A. graminifolia. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} use of growth {{regulators}} to reduce lodging of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The field trial was conducted in corn production area on a clay-loamy glue fluvisol since 2012 to 2014. An effect of growth regulators was monitored on spring barley of the variety Bojos. Preparations Retacel extra R 68 (<b>chlormequat</b> <b>chloride),</b> Moddus (trinexapac-ethyl) and Cerone 480 SL (etephon) were chosen to crop regulation. The aim of the thesis was to carry intensive crop barley focused on correct application of growth regulators according to the cultivation methodologies. Growth regulators were used in various combinations {{with one another in}} three dose and dosage times. From this reason cob length, number of seeds per spike, grain yield and selected parameters of malting barley quality were monitored and evaluated. There was no negative effect of different combinations and does of growth regulators on production and quality of spring barley while the aim of crop shortening was achieved. In 2014 up to 20 % of the effect of stalk length shortage was achieved. The greatest shortening was achieved on the stalks with higher dose of Cerone.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} types of plant growth retardants on fungal gibberellin (GA) formation has been studied in cultures of Gibberella fujikuroi and Sphaceloma manihoticola. Quaternary ammonium compounds (<b>chlormequat</b> <b>chloride,</b> mepiquat chloride, Amo- 1618), triazoles (uniconazole and several experimental compounds), and the norbornanodiazetine tetcyclacis inhibited GA biosynthesis in both fungal species. Concentrations between 2 × 10 − 4 and 10 − 9 m were required for a 50 % inhibition of the production of gibberellin A 3 in Gibberella fujikuroi and of giberellin A 4 in Sphaceloma manihoticola. The formation of other prominent GAs was affected at a similar degree of intensity. Tetcyclacis was the most active compound in both fungi. Compared to the growth retardants mentioned above, the biological activity of chlorphonium chloride was low. The acylcyclohexanediones prohexadione and LAB 198 999 had virtually no activity. Most likely, this lack of activity is due to a rapid metabolism of the compounds in the cultures. For the triazole-type compounds and tetcyclacis, a relatively distinct correlation exists in their ability to inhibit GA formation in fungal cultures, to block ent-kaurene oxygenase in a cell-free system, and to reduce shoot growth of rice seedlings. Due to differences in their metabolic fate and species specificities, such conclusions cannot be made for the other compounds...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{plant growth}} {{regulators}} (PGRs) {{are used in}} the production of ornamental potted and bedding plants. Growth control is needed for maximizing production per unit area, reducing transportation costs and to obtain a desired visual quality. However, the use of PGRs is associated with toxicity risks to humans and the environment. In many countries the availability of PGRs is restricted as few substances are registered for use. A number of alternative methods have been suggested. The methods include genetic methods (breeding) and crop cultivation practices such as fertigation, temperature and light management. A lot of research into “alternative” growth regulation was performed during the 1980 - 1990 s, revealing several possible ways of using different climatic factors to optimize plant growth with respect to plant height. In recent years, the interest in climatic growth regulation has been resurrected, not least due to the coming phase-out of the plant growth regulator <b>chlormequat</b> <b>chloride</b> (CCC). Today, authorities in many countries are aiming towards reducing the use of agrochemicals. At the same time, there is a strong demand from consumers for products produced without chemicals. This article provides a broad overview of available methods for non-chemical growth control. It is concluded that a combination of plant breeding and management of temperature, fertigation and light management has the potential of replacing chemical growth regulators in the commercial production of ornamental pot- and bedding plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{chemical}} manipulation {{through the use}} of plant growth regulators on white clover (Trifolium repens L.) cv. Grasslands Pitau grown for seed were investigated in this study, using both sward and individual plant trials. A white clover seed crop was established in autumn 1988, certified breeders seed of cv. Grasslands Pitau being sown at 3 kg/ha in 45 cm rows. Three plant growth regulators, <b>chlormequat</b> <b>chloride</b> (1. 5 and 3. 0 kg a. i. /ha), paclobutrazol (0. 5 and 1. 0 kg a. i. /ha) and triapenthenol (0. 5 and 1. 0 kg a. i. /ha) were applied at two growth stages; during reproductive initiation (11 October) or at the appearance of the first visible bud (8 November). A further plant growth regulator, daminozide (2. 0 and 4. 0 kg a. i. /ha) was applied only in November. <b>Chlormequat</b> <b>chloride,</b> daminozide and triapenthenol did not significantly affect node production, inflorescence production or seed yield, although thousand seed weight (TSW) was reduced. Paclobutrazol significantly reduced petiole length and increased the number of nodes/m 2, but did not affect dry matter production. The October application of paclobutrazol at 1. 0 kg a. i. /ha significantly increased potential harvestable seed yield by 71 % through increasing the number of inflorescences produced, but the 57 % increase following the November application at the same rate did not differ significantly from the control. Actual seed yield differences (+ 25 and 26 %) were also not significant. In the following season (1989 / 1990), three of the plant growth regulators (<b>chlormequat</b> <b>chloride</b> at 3. 0 kg a. i. /ha, paclobutrazol at 1. 0 kg a. i. /ha, triapenthenol at 1. 0 kg a. i. /ha) were applied using the same site as for the 1988 / 1989 trial (i. e. a second year crop), but avoiding plots previously sprayed with paclobutrazol to eliminate possible soil residual effects. Applications were either during early reproductive initiation (September), during peak reproductive initiation (October) or when reproductive buds/early flowers were first visible (November). <b>Chlormequat</b> <b>chloride</b> did not affect either vegetative or reproductive growth and development. Triapenthenol initially retarded growth (e. g. by reducing petiole length), but this effect was only transiatory, and was no longer evident 3 weeks after application. Although triapenthenol applied in November increased inflorescence number at peak flowering, seed yield was not increased. Triapenthenol applied in October did not affect inflorescence number at peak flowering, but reduced TSW. Paclobutrazol applied in September, October and November reduced petiole length and leaf size, but only application in November increased both node and stolon production. Application in October and November increased inflorescence numbers at peak flowering and harvest respectively, but seed yield was not increased. Data recorded from plots sprayed with paclobutrazol the previous season (1988 / 1989) provided no evidence of growth retardation through soil residual activity. In an attempt to clarify the effects of paclobutrazol on white clover growth and development, individual plants grown from seeds selected at random from a lot of certified breeders seed were established as spaced plants (80 x 80 cm) in the field in spring of 1990. Paclobutrazol was applied at 1. 0 kg a. i. /ha on 6 November 1990 (when more than 75 % of the plants were initiating reproductive buds at their terminal buds) or 23 November 1990 (when more than 50 % of the plant population had reproductive buds visible on their stolons). Petiole length and leaf size were initially reduced, but beginning two months after application, vigorous regrowth occurred, to the extent that paclobutrazol treated plants became as tall as the control plants. However, retardation effects occurred again at harvest. Total plant dry matter and root:shoot ratios were not affected by paclobutrazol. Chlorophyll content/unit leaf area and leaf thickness increased following paclobutrazol application, but increases were not correlated. Seed yield and yield components did not differ from that of the control plants, mainly because plant to plant variation was very large, irrespective of treatment. To attempt to reduce this source of variation, a further spaced plant trial was established in 1991 / 1992 using plants produced by clonal propagation from three distinct genotypes from within cv. Grasslands Pitau. Paclobutrazol was applied at the same rate and time as in the previous season, and while not affecting the number of nodes developed along stolons or inflorescence initiation at the stolon apices, it did significantly increase stolon production in all three genotypes through increasing secondary, tertiary {{and to a lesser extent}} quaternary branch numbers. However, not all these extra stolons were able to produce inflorescences, and this ability varied significantly with genotype. As a consequence, inflorescence number and potential harvestable seed yield were significandy increased only in one genotype following paclobutrazol application. However, paclobutrazol reduced seed abortion and increased seed weight in all three genotypes. In individual plants, inflorescence growth and development from emergence to the seed ripening stage occurred more quickly in paclobutrazol treated plants than untreated plants. A simulated sward trial was used in 1990 / 1991 to determine whether the previous failures to significantly increase actual seed yield were because paclobutrazol treated plots had ripened earlier than control plots, and as a consequence more seed had been shed by the time of harvest. However, no significant paclobutrazolXharvest time interactions for seed yield or seed yield components were recorded. These results suggest that paclobutrazol did not affect seed maturity in a sward situation. Irrespective of treatment, greatest seed yield came from harvesting 25 days after peak flowering, but this did not differ significantly from harvesting 35 days after peak flowering. Delaying harvest to 40 and 45 days after peak flowering significantly reduced seed yield. As in previous sward trials, paclobutrazol application significantly increased inflorescence numbers, but large (+ 56 %) differences in potential harvestable and actual seed yield were statistically not significant. In each case, high data variation (CV > 30 %) was recorded. Factors responsible for the failure of apparent biological increases to be statistically real are briefly discussed...|$|E

Drought stress {{is one of the}} {{important}} limiting factors of plant growth. Water stress has significant effects on morphological and biochemical characteristics of purple Basil. As the soil water content decreases, the plant height, stem diameter, number and area of leaves, leaf area index (LAI), herb yield and leaf chlorophyll contents (a,b and total chlorophyll) decrease, as well. However, the amounts of anthocyanin and proline increase. Cycocel (CCC) which chemically called <b>chlormequat</b> <b>chloride</b> is an alkylating agent and a quaternary ammonium salt [...] Cycocel is used as plant growth regulator. Application of Cycocel increases the number of siliques/ plant, seed yield and dry matter produced of oilseed rape.
