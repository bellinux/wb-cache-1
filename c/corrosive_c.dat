40|$|Background: A {{growing number}} of studies have {{identified}} cleaners as a group at risk for adverse health effects of the skin and the respiratory tract. Chemical substances present in cleaning products could be responsible for these effects. Currently, only limited information is available about irritant and health hazardous chemical substances found in cleaning products. We hypothesized that chemical substances present in cleaning products are known health hazardous substances that might be involved in adverse health effects of the skin and the respiratory tract. Methods: We performed a systematic review of cleaning products used in the Swiss cleaning sector. We surveyed Swiss professional cleaning companies (n 51476) to identify the most used products (n 5105) for inclusion. Safety data sheets (SDSs) were reviewed and hazardous substances present in cleaning products were tabulated with current European and global harmonized system hazard labels. Results: Professional cleaning products are mixtures of substances (arithmetic mean 3. 5 ¡ 2. 8), and more than 132 different chemical substances were identified in 105 products. The main groups of chemicals were fragrances, glycol ethers, surfactants, solvents; and to a lesser extent, phosphates, salts, detergents, pH-stabilizers, acids, and bases. Up to 75 % of products contained irritant (Xi), 64 % harmful (Xn) and 28 % <b>corrosive</b> (<b>C)</b> labeled substances.

The local corrosion under the insulation, the deposits {{or to be}} caused by bacteria, 10 to 100 times faster than the corrosion damage is uniform. CO 2 corrosion in gas wells temperature can be divided into three regions: A) Temperature below 140 degrees Fahrenheit (C 60) does not protect the product and the level of corrosion caused by severe corrosion exists. B) Above 300 degrees F (C 150), Mgntayt is formed and the environment unless the presence of large amounts of salt water, is slightly <b>corrosive.</b> <b>C)</b> Between 300 - 140 degrees Fahrenheit (C 150 - 60) has the ability to protect the metal carbonate product layer does not even need a deterrent. But in the presence of ions such as chloride or hydrogen sulfide, or the destructive effect of high velocity fluid layer may be destroyed.

At lower temperatures the formation of this layer decreases and the corrosion rate increases.

40|$|Abstract. The {{standard}} ISO 14713 - 1 {{shows that}} HDG coatings should protect steel in the <b>corrosive</b> atmosphere <b>C</b> 5 for 10 – 21 years. It was observed that pitting corrosion appears already after 2 – 3 years on roads and urban infrastructures and both Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) {{have shown that}} lead inclusions were present in all such corroded zinc coatings. The laboratory prepared HDG coatings with different amount of lead inclusions were investigated by gravimetric method (after exposure in salt chamber), SEM with EDS, and Glow Discharge Optical Emission Spectrometry (GDOES). The corrosion resistance was analyzed in the polarization tests and local probe techniques. The inclusions could accelerate coating corrosion because lead is cathodic to zinc...|$|R
40|$|Adsorbent and {{corrosion}} resistant films {{are useful for}} sensor development. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} work is the production and characterization of plasma polymerized fluorinated organic ether thin films for sensor development. The polymerized reactant was methyl nonafluoro(iso) butyl ether. Infrared Spectroscopy showed fluorinated species and eventually CO but CH(n) is a minor species. Contact angle measurements indicated that the film is hydrophobic and organophilic but oleophobic. Optical microscopy reveals not only a good adherence on metals and acrylic but also resistance for organic solvents, acid and basic aqueous solution exposure. Double layer and intermixing are possible and might lead to island formation. Quartz Crystal Microbalance showed that 2 -propanol permeates the film but there is no sensitivity to n-hexane. The microreactor manufactured using a 73 cm long microchannel can retain approximately 9 X 10 (- 4) g/cm(2) of 2 -propanol in vapor phase. Therefore, the film is a good candidate for preconcentration of volatile organic compounds even in <b>corrosive</b> environment. (<b>C)</b> 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{approach to}} the management of corrosive burns of the upper gastrointestinal tract leaves a considerable morbidity and a heavy mortality rate. This work evaluates {{the effectiveness of a}} new therapeutic approach given to 94 consecutive patients. The management has been based on three major points: (1) the definition of extent of upper gastrointestinal lesions by immediate fibroendoscopy; (2) immediate protection of the upper gastrointestinal tract by total parenteral nutrition in cases with serious burns (41 cases), normal oral nutrition being allowed for minor burns (35 cases); (3) reparative surgical procedures for any of the sequelae of such burns during the fibrosing phase. The results were as follows: (a) healing, depending upon the degree of burn, occurred between eight to 90 days; (b) the frequency of subsequent local complications was small with total parenteral nutrition started a few hours after ingestion of the <b>corrosive</b> product; (<b>c)</b> after reconstructive surgery no serious complications occurred; (d) the overall morbidity stayed at a very low level (four patients). We conclude that the general prognosis of a severe burn of the upper gastrointestinal tract, without other trauma, is appreciably improved by the very early institution of total parenteral nutrition...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{influence}} of the corrosion exposure time on the mechanical properties degradation of the aluminum 2024 -T 3 alloy is studied. Tensile and fracture toughness mechanical tests had been carried out on pre-corroded specimens, exposed for different times to laboratory accelerated, exfoliation corrosion solution. The test results show that both the tensile mechanical properties as well as the fracture toughness exponentially decreased with increasing exposure time. A mechanical model has been devised to calculate the specimen's remaining effective thickness after different corrosion exposure times. It has been shown that the decrease in the alloy's fracture toughness is mainly associated with the thickness reduction degradation mechanism and a small reduction is attributed to hydrogen embrittlement. The hydrogen embrittlement degradation mechanism is saturated for exposure times up to 24 h. For higher exposure times, the prevailing degradation mechanism of alloy's fracture toughness is the formation of corrosion-induced surface cracks and the resulting reduction of the effective thickness of the test specimen. An FE model has been developed for a fast calculation of the uncorroded alloy's fracture toughness with good results. The model has also been exploited to predict the alloy's fracture toughness degradation for the increasing exposure time to <b>Corrosive</b> environment. (<b>C)</b> 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The authors {{evaluated}} {{the usefulness of}} nanoscale boehmite crystals as a filler for anti-wear and anti-corrosion polyphenylenesulfide (PPS) coatings exposed to a very harsh, 300 <b>C</b> <b>corrosive</b> geothermal environment. The boehmite fillers dispersed uniformly into the PPS coating, conferring two advanced properties: First, they reduced markedly the rate of blasting wear; second, they increased the PPS's glass transition temperature and thermal decomposition temperature. The wear rate of PPS surfaces was reduced three times when 5 wt% boehmite was incorporated into the PPS. During exposure for 15 days at 300 C, the PPS underwent hydrothermal oxidation, leading to the substitution of sulfide linkages by the sulfite linkages. However, such molecular alteration did not significantly diminish {{the ability of the}} coating to protect carbon steel against corrosion. In fact, PPS coating filled with boehmite of {le} 5 wt% adequately mitigated its corrosion in brine at 300 C. One concern in using this filler was that it absorbs brine. Thus, adding an excess amount of boehmite was detrimental to achieving the maximum protection afforded by the coatings...|$|R
40|$|In the environments of high {{temperature}} (300 o C - 1000 o <b>C),</b> <b>corrosive</b> and even irradiation application, {{the challenges of}} providing reliable and accurate flow rate measurement is significant. In comparing with many other existing technologies for normal operation environments, correlated thermal transit-time flow meter show its advantages of resolving the challenges encountered in those harsh conditions. The correlated thermal signals can be detected by two separated thermal sensors (for example, thermocouples) in series alignment along the pipe, and derive the flow rate. It was evaluated to have accurate measurement for small pipe at slow fluid speed. In the higher flow rate and big pipe size application, this technology shows its weakness due to the limitations associated with slow response time of thermal sensor, dimension, and low strength of thermal signal. In this project, we present a sophisticated layout of thermal transit-time flow meter with validation of numerical simulation and experiments. We observed that the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results and showing that the measured flow is successfully extended to high range and with stable and accurate measurement results. Also, the linear hypothesis of ratio between the bypass to the main flow was successfully tested...|$|R
40|$|Stainless steel {{canisters}} {{encased in}} vented concrete overpacks {{are used to}} store used nuclear fuel at interim spent fuel storage installations in the United States. These storage systems {{are exposed to the}} elements. There is concern that, over time, a deliquesced salt film could develop on the stainless steel canister. Such a film can create a corrosive environment in stainless steels. If a stress is present on or in then material, stress corrosion cracking (SCC) could be a possibility. Because the canister welds are not stress-relieved in order to avoid sensitization of the steel, residual stresses are expected to be present in the canisters. Thus, there is interest in determining the likelihood that (a) a sufficiently corrosive film develops on a stainless steel used fuel canister (b) there are sufficiently high stresses in the material at the location of the <b>corrosive</b> film (<b>c)</b> SCC initiates and (d) the crack propagates through the canister wall, resulting in canister failure. This thesis begins with the assumption that a corrosive film has developed on the canister surface, and pits have begun to initiate. It investigates various methods of modeling SCC in the canister wall after the point of corrosion pit initiation. An extensive literature review was carried out {{in order to understand the}} different SCC models that currently exist in the literature. A figure-of-merit was developed to decide which models were the most likely to be helpful to the modeling of SCC in used fuel canisters. The figure-of-merit was then used to select the most promising models. These models were then used to write MATLAB@ simulations that could be used to predict time-to-failure in canisters due to SCC once corrosion pits have begun to grow. The results of these simulations are then considered and compared, and used to inform recommendations for future development of a useful predictive model of SCC in used fuel canisters. by Sara Elizabeth Ferry.

40|$|Since {{the early}} {{fundamental}} research on superlattice structured hard coatings {{in the late}} 1980 s, rapid progress has been achieved to produce nanoscale compositionally modulated multilayer structures. It {{has been shown that}} the periodicity of the multilayers is strongly controlled by the substrate rotation and the actual deposition rate. Appropriate multi-target geometry and controlled target poisoning by optimised pumping conditions lead to deposition conditions similar in their economy to the deposition of typical monolithically grown binary hard coatings. The combined steered cathodic are/unbalanced magnetron technology guaranties sufficient adhesion (L-C > 50 N) of the usually highly stressed coatings as well as smooth surfaces due to UBM deposition (R-a m). This paper has described the properties of coatings dedicated to high temperature performance: TiAlN/CrN (period 3. 03 nm), to tribological applications: TiAlYN/VN (period 3. 62 nm) and combined wear and corrosion resistance CrN/NbN (period 3. 2 nm). All the coatings investigated were found to crystallise into B 1 NaCl f. c. c. structures, and exhibited { 110 } and { 111 } or { 100 } preferred orientations for TiAl/CrN, TiAlYN/VN and CrN/NbN superlattice coatings, respectively. The residual stress was found to be compressive in the range of - 4. 0 to - 8. 5 GPa for TiAlYN/VN and between - 1. 8 and - 7. 5 GPa for CrN/NbN, depending on the stoichiometry and the bias voltage during coating deposition. Corresponding to the high stress values, the plastic hardness of the coatings was measured to be 55 - 60 GPa for TiAlN/CrN, 42 - 78 GPa for the TiAlYN/VN system and between 42 and 56 GPa for CrN/NbN, depending on the bias voltage. Oxidation resistance at temperatures exceeding 900 degreesC was typical for TiAlN/CrN. The TiAlYN/VN coating showed superior tribological properties with a coefficient of friction mu = 0. 4 and low sliding wear of 1. 26 X 10 (- 17) m(2) N- 1 after 1. 1 million cycles against an Al 2 O 3 ball in a pin-on-disc test. CrN/NbN exhibited two orders of magnitude lower passive current densities than electroplated hard Cr and a pitting potential of 450 mV during polarisation in acetate buffer solution. When Nb+ ion etching was used, the CrN/NbN superlattice coating deposited on 304 L, stainless steel showed high pitting potentials in the range of 750 - 1000 mV in the same <b>corrosive</b> medium.

40|$|This licentiate {{study was}} {{initiated}} by copper, zinc and galvanized steel producers in Europe, who felt {{a need to}} assess runoff rates of copper and zinc from the pure metals and commercial products at marine exposure conditions. Their motive was the increasing concern in various European countries and the on-going risk assessments of copper and zinc within the European commission. Also the circumstance that available runoff rates so far, had been reported for mainly urban exposure conditions, rather than marine. A collaboration was therefore established with the French Corrosion Institute, which runs a marine test site in Brest, {{and a set of}} vital questions were formulated. Their answers are the essence of this licentiate study. Based on the ISO corrosivity classification and one-year exposures, the marine atmosphere of Brest is fairly corrosive for zinc (class C 3) and highly <b>corrosive</b> for copper (<b>C</b> 4). Despite higher corrosivity classifications for both metals in Brest compared to the urban site of Stockholm, used as a reference site, nearly all runoff rates assessed for copper, zinc and their commercial products were lower in Brest compared to Stockholm. This was attributed to a higher surface wetting in Brest and concomitant higher removal rate of deposited chloride and sulphate species from the marine-exposed surfaces. The comparison shows that measured corrosion rates cannot be used to predict runoff rates, since different physicochemical processes govern corrosion and runoff respectively. For copper, the runoff rate in Brest was approximately 1. 1 g m- 2 yr- 1 with cuprite (Cu 2 O) as main patina constituent. During periods of very high chloride and sulphate deposition, paratacamite (Cu 2 Cl(OH) 3) formed which increased the runoff rate to 1. 5 g m- 2 yr- 1. For zinc, with hydrozincite (Zn 5 (CO 3) 2 (OH) 6) as the main patina constituent, the runoff rate was relatively stable at 2. 6 g m- 2 yr- 1 throughout the year, despite episodes of heavy chloride and sulphate deposition. The application of organic coatings of varying thickness on artificially patinated copper or on different zinc-based products resulted in improved barrier properties and reduced runoff rates that seem highly dependent on thickness. The thickest organic coating (150 µm thick), applied on hot dipped galvanized steel, reduced the runoff rate by a factor of 100. No deterioration of organic coatings was observed during the one-year exposures. Alloying zinc-based products with aluminium resulted in surface areas enriched in aluminium and concomitant reduced zinc runoff rates. The release rate and bioavailability of copper from different anti-fouling paints into artificial seawater was also investigated. It turned out that the release rate not only depends on the copper concentration in the paint, but also on paint matrix properties and other released metal constituents detected. Far from all copper was bioavailabe at the immediate release situation. In all, the results suggest the importance of assessing the ecotoxic response of anti-fouling paints not only by regarding the copper release, but rather through an integrated effect of all matrix constituents.
