The truck was loaded with 300kg of medicines, to the value of NOK 50,000. These medicines were to be delivered to the hospital of humanitarian Albert Schweitzer in Lambaréné, near the final destination of Libreville, the capital of Gabon. From Oslo the expedition continued to Helsingborg in Sweden and Copenhagen in Denmark, where more medicines were brought along. For public relations purposes the expedition made its way through several European citiesincluding Hamburg, Cologne, The Hague and Brusselsand was received with ceremony and much attention everywhere. In Belgium a problem arose over a missing <b>customs</b> <b>declaration</b> for the ice, but this was solved when a customs official agreed to accompany the cars through the country. Klevan later received a personal apology for this inconvenience, conveyed by the Norwegian foreign minister Halvard Lange from Lange's Belgian colleague and personal friend.|$|E
25|$|In some {{countries}} yacht ensigns {{are different from}} merchant ensigns in order to signal that the yacht is not carrying cargo that requires a <b>customs</b> <b>declaration.</b> Carrying commercial cargo on a boat with a yacht ensign is deemed to be smuggling in many jurisdictions. There is a system of international maritime signal flags for numerals and letters of the alphabet. Each flag or pennant has a specific meaning when flown individually. As well, semaphore flags {{can be used to}} communicate on an ad hoc basis from ship to ship over short distances.|$|E

50|$|In the 20th century, as {{international}} trade and travel increased dramatically, the Customs Service transitioned from an administrative bureau to a federal law enforcement agency. Inspectors still inspected goods and took <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> from travelers at ports of entry, but Customs Special Agents used modern police methods—often in concert with allied agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and U.S. Border Patrol—to investigate cases often far from international airports, bridges and land crossings.|$|R
40|$|Russian {{authorities}} give two official {{figures for}} {{imports of goods}} to Russia. Russian Customs registers values stated in <b>customs</b> <b>declarations,</b> while the Central Bank of Russia adds in its estimate of grey imports to obtain an overall import figure. Using mirror statistics of Russia’s main trading partners, we suggest that grey imports are in fact higher than the CBR estimate. Hence, official statements of trade and current ac-count surpluses should be reduced to better reflect Russia’s actual ex-ternal balance. This would also imply less capital outflow from Russia than suggested by current estimates...|$|R
40|$|Custom transit is {{one step}} of custom {{clearance}} which is faced by many exporters when they export goods {{from the mainland}} of China. The transit formality requires exporters to preform <b>custom</b> <b>declaration</b> in the local custom and to do a custom transit in the port of departure. Such procedures aim to keep the export goods under custom control. Although custom transit indeed safeguards the goods on the way, it actually complicates the custom clearance formalities and increases the transaction cost of the international trade. Therefore, simplifying custom transit procedures could bring benefits to China export business, which contributes to approximately 12...|$|R
5000|$|If not {{traveling}} with the goods, which are shipped, one must use other <b>customs</b> <b>declaration</b> forms, such as: a commercial invoice, or a proforma invoice, or an import declaration form, or an ATA Carnet, or a re-export declaration. Incoterms on these forms define the shipment and <b>customs</b> <b>declaration.</b> For example, the form many require an Hs code (harmonize code), which helps define the type of goods and their associated tax rate, if any. Also, the forms normally require the traveler to note the country of origin of the goods and may sometimes require a certificate of origin. These forms {{can also be used}} when hand carrying goods across a border. Errors on the forms can cause delays or confiscation of the goods. For that reason, importers often use a customs brokerage to clear goods through customs.|$|E

5000|$|The major {{function}} of CHIEF is {{to manage the}} data behind import and export movements and calculate revenues due on those movements. CHIEF accepts <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> from traders (possibly via CSPs - see below), validates the data, and if valid records it. It profiles the data sent and will award a [...] "route of entry" [...] to the declaration. This describes the steps that must occur for the movement to be permitted, and may include automatic clearance for trusted traders or a physical inspection of the good or paperwork for other traders.Having accepted declaration data, CHIEF and the inventory system that is managing the physical movement of the goods communicate (without involving the trader).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of beliefs about own {{performance}} or appearance for compliance at the customs. In an experiment in which underreporting has a higher expected payoff than truthful reporting we find: a large share, about 15 - 20 percent of the subjects, is more compliant if they have reason to imagine that their performance influences their subjective audit probability. In contrast, we do not find evidence for individuals who believe that by their personal performance they can reduce the subjective probability for an audit. Our {{results suggest that the}} power of imagination, i. e. {{the role of}} second-order beliefs in the process of <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> is important and may potentially be used to improve customs and tax compliance.

This {{research}} paper explores {{the current state}} of play regarding crossborder trade and logistics operations in Switzerland, aiming to identify opportunities to reduce costs and to improve efficiencies in cross-border supply chains, covering procedures, tools and services associated with import, export and transit procedures. The study present the following conclusions and recommendations: Interactive and user friendly e-Customs services which facilitate the preparation, filing, tracking and storage of <b>customs</b> <b>declarations,</b> amongst other functions, can help to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in cross-border supply chains. Design and implementation of e-Customs services need to be driven by tangible benefits for the private sector, including facilitating export procedures, improving flexibility when working with customs, reducing the need to re-enter any customs data during the declaration processes, and enabling a seamless flow of data between the parties involved...|$|R
