5|$|Despite Marx's {{stress on}} {{critique}} {{of capitalism and}} discussion of the new communist society that should replace it, his explicit critique of <b>capitalism</b> <b>is</b> guarded, {{as he saw it}} as an improved society compared to the past ones (slavery and feudal). Marx also never clearly discusses issues of morality and justice, although scholars agree that his work contained implicit discussion of those concepts.|$|E
5|$|Rosemary Hennessy and Chrys Ingraham {{say that}} materialist forms of {{feminism}} {{grew out of}} Western Marxist thought and have inspired {{a number of different}} (but overlapping) movements, all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focused on ideology's relationship to women. Marxist feminism argues that <b>capitalism</b> <b>is</b> the root cause of women's oppression, and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies. Socialist feminism distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression. Anarcha-feminists believe that class struggle and anarchy against the state require struggling against patriarchy, which comes from involuntary hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|Weber's essay The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of <b>Capitalism</b> <b>is</b> {{his most}} famous work. It is argued that this work should {{not be viewed as}} a {{detailed}} study of Protestantism, but rather as an introduction into Weber's later works, especially his studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economic behaviour as part of the rationalisation of the economic system. In The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Weber put forward the thesis that Calvinist ethic and ideas influenced the development of capitalism. He noted the post-Reformation shift of Europe's economic centre away from Catholic countries such as France, Spain and Italy, and toward Protestant countries such as the Netherlands, England, Scotland and Germany. Weber also noted that societies having more Protestants were those with a more highly developed capitalist economy. Similarly, in societies with different religions, most successful business leaders were Protestant. Weber thus argued that Roman Catholicism impeded the development of the capitalist economy in the West, as did other religions such as Confucianism and Buddhism elsewhere in the world.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reason for}} <b>capitalism's</b> great {{vitality}} <b>is,</b> apart from new technology, products and materials; and big companies, governments and trade union; {{and in addition}} to its pluralistic philosophy, academic freedom and democratic politics, is that it did not limit, but tried to develop critique. <b>Capitalism</b> may <b>be</b> a pile of evil, but this fact is constantly exposed, and given unceasingly attention. Improvements great or small can thus <b>be</b> made. Hence, <b>capitalism</b> <b>was</b> enabled to continue; [...] "…I see that the <b>capitalism</b> cannot <b>be</b> extinguished through violent revolution, because of its improvement through critique [...] …" ...|$|R

25|$|The modern TSSI {{approach}} has been criticized by other Marxist and neo-Ricardian scholars including Gerard Duménil, Duncan K. Foley, Michel Husson, David Laibman, Dominique Lévy, Simon Mohun, Gary Mongiovi, Ernesto Screpanti, Ajit Sinha, and Roberto Veneziani. The main idea of these critics is, that if equilibrium is let go of, then <b>capitalism</b> <b>is</b> an unpredictable chaos, and no coherent theory of prices or profits is possible anymore.|$|E
25|$|In Capitalism and Freedom (1962), Friedman further {{developed}} Friedrich Hayek's {{argument that}} economic freedom, while itself {{an extremely important}} component of total freedom, is also {{a necessary condition for}} political freedom. He commented that centralized control of economic activities was always accompanied with political repression. In his view, voluntary character of all transactions in a free market economy and wide diversity that it permits are fundamental threats to repressive political leaders and greatly diminish power to coerce. Through elimination of centralized control of economic activities, economic power is separated from political power, and the one can serve as counterbalance to the other. Friedman feels that competitive <b>capitalism</b> <b>is</b> especially important to minority groups, since impersonal market forces protect people from discrimination in their economic activities for reasons unrelated to their productivity.|$|E
25|$|Further, London {{assumed that}} the Socialist Party would become a mass party in the United States, strong {{enough to have a}} {{realistic}} chance of winning national elections and gaining power, while remaining a revolutionary party still committed to the dismantling of capitalism. The whole book is based on Marx's view that <b>capitalism</b> <b>is</b> inherently unsustainable. This would precipitate a brutal counter-reaction, with capitalists preserving their power by discarding democracy and instituting a brutal repressive regime. Although this exact scenario never came to pass in the US, where the Socialist Party remained small and marginal, events closely followed London's script elsewhere; for example, in Chile in 1973, where the government of socialist president Salvador Allende was overthrown by a CIA-backed coup led by General Augusto Pinochet. This prompted later publishers of London's book to use a cover illustration depicting a poster of Allende being ground beneath the heel of a boot.|$|E

2500|$|Burnham's seminal work, The Managerial Revolution, {{attempted}} to theorize {{about the future}} of world capitalism based upon observations of its development in the interwar period. Burnham argued three possible futures for capitalism: (1) that <b>capitalism</b> <b>was</b> a permanent form of social and economic organization {{and that it would be}} continued for a protracted period of time; (2) that <b>capitalism</b> <b>was</b> a temporary form of organization destined by its nature to collapse and be replaced by socialism; (3) that <b>capitalism</b> <b>was</b> a temporary form of organization currently being transformed into some non-socialist future form of society. Burnham argued that since capitalism had a more or less definite beginning, which he dated to approximately the 14th Century, it could not be regarded as an immutable and permanent form. Moreover, Burnham observed that in the last years of previous forms of economic organization, such as those of Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire, mass unemployment was [...] "a symptom that a given type of social organization is just about finished." [...] The worldwide mass unemployment of the depression era was, for Burnham, indicative that <b>capitalism</b> <b>was</b> itself [...] "not going to continue much longer." ...|$|R

25|$|<b>Capitalism</b> <b>is</b> decried in Petals of Blood, {{with the}} new Kenyan elite portrayed as {{controlled}} by the 'faceless system of capitalism'. The everyman loses out to capitalist endeavours, and is essentially exploited by the new Kenyan elite. Farmers are forced to mark out their lands and mortgage them with loans linked {{to the success of}} their harvest; as the quality of the harvests waver, many are forced to sell their land, unable to match their loan repayments. Thang'eta is another symbol of capitalism. Taken from a drink that Nyakinyua brews in a traditional ceremony, it is soon marketed, and becomes extremely popular. Wanja, who introduces the drink to Abdulla's bar, is then exploited by big business who forces her to stop her Thang'eta operation. Neither she nor Munira, who creates the slogan, receive the fruits of their labour. Originally a drink used to help people relax and escape their current problems, it becomes 'a drink of strife'.|$|E
500|$|Simon {{described}} {{the second season}} as [...] "a meditation {{on the death of}} work and the betrayal of the American working class... it is a deliberate argument that unencumbered <b>capitalism</b> <b>is</b> not a substitute for social policy; that on its own, without a social compact, raw <b>capitalism</b> <b>is</b> destined to serve the few {{at the expense of the}} many." [...] He added that season 3 [...] "reflects on the nature of reform and reformers, and whether there is any possibility that political processes, long calcified, can mitigate against the forces currently arrayed against individuals." [...] The third season is also an allegory that draws explicit parallels between the Iraq War and drug prohibition, which in Simon's view has failed in its aims and has become a war against America's underclass. This is portrayed by Major Colvin, imparting to Carver his view that policing has been allowed to become a war and thus will never succeed in its aims.|$|E
500|$|Ecosocialists {{advocate}} for the revolutionary succession of capitalism by ecosocialism—an egalitarian economic/political/social structure designed to harmonize human society with non-human ecology and to fulfill human needs—as the only sufficient solution to the present-day ecological crisis, and hence the only path towards sustainability. Sustainability is viewed not as a domain exclusive to scientists, environmental activists, and business leaders but as a holistic project that must involve the whole of humanity redefining its place in Nature: [...] "What every environmentalist needs to know ... is that <b>capitalism</b> <b>is</b> not the solution but the problem, and that if humanity is going to survive this crisis, it will do so because it has exercised its capacity for human freedom, through social struggle, {{in order to create}} a whole new world—in coevolution with the planet." ...|$|E

500|$|Weber's main {{intellectual}} {{concern was}} understanding {{the processes of}} rationalisation, secularisation, and [...] "disenchantment" [...] that he associated {{with the rise of}} capitalism and modernity, and which he saw {{as the result of a}} new way of thinking about the world. Weber is best known for his thesis combining economic sociology and the sociology of religion, elaborated in his book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, in which he proposed that ascetic Protestantism was one of the major [...] "elective affinities" [...] associated with the rise in the Western world of market-driven capitalism and the rational-legal nation-state. He argued that it was in the basic tenets of Protestantism to boost capitalism. Thus, it can be said that the spirit of <b>capitalism</b> <b>is</b> inherent to Protestant religious values.|$|E
500|$|Marx's view of {{capitalism}} was two-sided. On one hand, in the 19th century's deepest {{critique of the}} dehumanising aspects of this system he noted that defining features {{of capitalism}} include alienation, exploitation and recurring, cyclical depressions leading to mass unemployment, while {{on the other hand}} <b>capitalism</b> <b>is</b> also characterised by [...] "revolutionising, industrialising and universalising qualities of development, growth and progressivity" [...] (by which Marx meant industrialisation, urbanisation, technological progress, increased productivity and growth, rationality and scientific revolution) that are responsible for progress. Marx considered the capitalist class {{to be one of the}} most revolutionary in history because it constantly improved the means of production, more so than any other class in history and was responsible for the overthrow of feudalism and its transition to capitalism. Capitalism can stimulate considerable growth because the capitalist can and has an incentive to reinvest profits in new technologies and capital equipment.|$|E
500|$|SP {{candidate}}s, such as New Jersey gubernatorial {{and senate}} candidate Greg Pason, have also emphasized immediate public service demands; these reforms include socializing the U.S. health care system, a steeply graduated income tax, universal rent control, and {{the elimination of}} all educational debts and tuition fees. In 1997, Pason called auto insurance [...] "a regressive tax against working people". Moore was also vocal of his support for public healthcare and socialized medicine. Moore believes that <b>capitalism</b> <b>is</b> a system based on both exploitation and selfishness, which operates to serve the interests of corporations and the ruling class, at the expense of workers and the poor. During his presidential campaign he claimed that the lack of available remedy to collapsing economic conditions stems from the capitalist system's foundation upon [...] "greed", and advocated its replacement with a new system founded upon economic democracy through social ownership and workers' control of our reigning industrial and financial institutions.|$|E

500|$|Gibson's second series, the [...] "Bridge trilogy", is {{composed}} of Virtual Light (1993), a [...] "darkly comic urban detective story", Idoru (1996), and All Tomorrow's Parties (1999). The first and third books in the trilogy center on San Francisco in the near future; all three explore Gibson's recurring themes of technological, physical, and spiritual transcendence in a more grounded, matter-of-fact style than his first trilogy. Salon.com's Andrew Leonard notes that in the Bridge trilogy, Gibson's villains change from multinational corporations and artificial intelligences of the Sprawl trilogy to the mass media– namely tabloid television and the cult of celebrity. Virtual Light depicts an [...] "end-stage capitalism, in which private enterprise and the profit motive are taken to their logical conclusion". This argument on the mass media as the natural evolution of <b>capitalism</b> <b>is</b> the opening line of the major Situationist work The Society of the Spectacle. Leonard's review called Idoru a [...] "return to form" [...] for Gibson, while critic Steven Poole asserted that All Tomorrow's Parties marked his development from [...] "science-fiction hotshot to wry sociologist of the near future." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007 the duo fronted the UK {{version of}} Apple Inc.'s [...] "Get a Mac" [...] adverts, with Mitchell playing PC. The adverts {{received}} much criticism. Writing in The Guardian, Charlie Brooker {{claimed that the}} use of Mitchell and Webb in the adverts was a curious choice. He compared the characters of PC and Mac in the adverts to those of Mark and Jeremy in Peep Show, stating that [...] "when you see the ads, you think, 'PCs are a bit rubbish yet ultimately lovable, whereas Macs are just smug, preening tossers.'" [...] The British Sitcom Guide also criticised the pair for [...] "selling their souls". One journalist called the adverts [...] "worse than not funny", and accused Mitchell and Webb of [...] "an act of grave betrayal" [...] for taking corporate work. In an interview with The Telegraph, Robert Webb responded to the duo's critics, stating that [...] "when someone asks, 'Do you want to do some funny ads for not many days in the year and be paid more than you would be for an entire series of Peep Show?' the answer, obviously, is, 'Yeah, that's fine.'" [...] In the same interview, Mitchell also said: [...] "I don't see what is morally inconsistent with a comedian doing an advert. It's all right to sell computers, isn't it? Unless you think that <b>capitalism</b> <b>is</b> evil– which I don't. It's not like we're helping to flog a baby-killing machine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Francis criticized capitalism, writing [...] "Capitalism, an {{economic}} system driven only, {{according to its}} own theory, by the accumulation of profit, {{is at least as}} much the enemy of tradition as the NAACP or communism ... The hostility of capitalism toward tradition is clear enough in its reduction of all social issues to economic ones. Moreover, like communism, <b>capitalism</b> <b>is</b> based on an essential egalitarianism that refuses to distinguish between one consumer's dollar and another. The reductionism and egalitarianism inherent in capitalism explains its destructive impact on social institutions. On the issue of immigration, <b>capitalism</b> <b>is</b> notorious for demanding cheap labor to undercut the cost of native workers." ...|$|E
