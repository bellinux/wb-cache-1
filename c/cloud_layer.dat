5|$|Jupiter's low axial tilt {{means that}} the poles {{constantly}} receive less solar radiation than at the planet's equatorial region. Convection within {{the interior of the}} planet transports more energy to the poles, balancing out the temperatures at the <b>cloud</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Astronomers did not observe {{large amounts}} of water {{following}} the collisions, and later impact studies found that fragmentation and destruction of the cometary fragments in an 'airburst' probably occurred at much higher altitudes than previously expected, with even the largest fragments being destroyed when the pressure reached , well above the expected depth of the water layer.

5|$|Above {{the layer}} of {{metallic}} hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938K. In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen {{is said to be}} in a supercritical fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the <b>cloud</b> <b>layer</b> to a depth of about 1,000km, and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary—the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{statistics of}} vertical air velocity at {{the bases of}} supercooled shallow <b>cloud</b> <b>layers</b> separately for mixed-phase and liquid-only clouds. For the ﬁrst time, this statistics is compared for clouds observed over a sub-tropical site at Cape Verde (14. 9 ° N, 26 ° W) and a mid-latitudinal site at Leipzig, Germany (51. 3 ° N, 12. 4 ° E). Phase properties and spatio-temporal extent of the <b>cloud</b> <b>layers</b> were obtained from combined observations with Doppler lidar, Raman polarization lidar, and cloud radar. The statistical properties of the vertical-velocity distributions in both mixed-phase and pure-liquid <b>cloud</b> <b>layers</b> {{are found to be}} similar at both measurement sites. Standard deviation of the vertical velocities at both sites was found to be 0. 4  m s − 1 and was also the same in pure-liquid and mixed-phase layers. Skewness groups around − 0. 4 for both sites, pointing to radiative cooling as the driver for the cloud turbulence. Occasionally, positive skewness in some <b>cloud</b> <b>layers</b> indicated external drivers, e. g., gravity waves, for the turbulence. From the observed similarity in the vertical-velocity statistics derived at the base of supercooled liquid <b>cloud</b> <b>layers</b> at Praia and Leipzig it can be concluded that other factors besides cloud dynamics are responsible for the differences in ice formation efﬁciency reported previously for both sites...|$|R

5|$|Jet stream-powered cirrus {{can grow}} {{long enough to}} stretch across continents while {{remaining}} only a few kilometers deep. When visible light interacts with the ice crystals in cirrus cloud, it produces optical phenomena such as sun dogs and halos. Cirrus is known to raise {{the temperature of the}} air beneath the main <b>cloud</b> <b>layer</b> by an average of 10°C (18°F). When the individual filaments become so extensive that they are virtually indistinguishable from one another, they form a sheet of high cloud called cirrostratus. Convection at high altitudes can produce another high-based genus called cirrocumulus, a pattern of small cloud tufts that contain droplets of supercooled water.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of air-to-air {{exercises}} and practice the Wing undertook a Circus operation on 3 August 1941. In the evening the Wing crossed out over Manston at 18,000ft and then dropped to 13,000ft over the coast at Gravelines and set course for Saint Omer. Near Ambleteuse five Bf 109Fs were sighted one thousand feet above and in front travelling past the Spitfires. The German fighters shadowed the flight before three detached and dived to attack, curving in from behind. The Spitfires turned into them. Finucane missed with his first burst of fire and chased the leading Bf 109 into cloud while following the Bf 109's condensation trail. Hitting the enemy with another burst from 200 yards the Bf 109 burst into flames. He sighted another formation of 18 Bf 109s above and climbed to attack supported by six Spitfires. Finucane scored hits on the tail unit of one which went down vertically and into a <b>cloud</b> <b>layer</b> at 2,000ft at which point contact was lost. Finucane claimed one destroyed and one probably destroyed. The operation elevated his tally to 7. The day was best remembered in Fighter Command {{for the loss of}} Flight Lieutenant Eric Lock who was shot down by ground-fire in the morning patrol.|$|E

25|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Uranus is composed primarily {{of gas and}} various ices. It is about 83% hydrogen, 15% helium, 2% methane and traces of acetylene. Like Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus has a banded <b>cloud</b> <b>layer,</b> although this is not readily visible without enhancement of visual images of the planet. Unlike the larger gas giants, the low temperatures in the upper Uranian <b>cloud</b> <b>layer,</b> down to 50 K, causes cloud formation from methane rather than ammonia.|$|E
25|$|Jupiter {{is covered}} with a <b>cloud</b> <b>layer</b> about 50km deep. The clouds are {{composed}} of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds are located in the tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. The best-known feature of the <b>cloud</b> <b>layer</b> is the Great Red Spot, a persistent anticyclonic storm located 22° south of the equator that is larger than Earth. In 2000, an atmospheric feature formed in the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to the Great Red Spot, but smaller in size. The feature was named Oval BA, and has been nicknamed Red Spot Junior.|$|E

Altocumulus near the top of its range may resemble cirrocumulus but is usually thicker and composed of water droplets so that the bases show at least some light-grey shading. Opaque altocumulus associated with a weak frontal or low-pressure disturbance can produce virga, very light intermittent precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground. If the altocumulus is mixed with moisture-laden altostratus, the precipitation may reach the ground.|$|E
25|$|Frontal and {{cyclonic}} lift {{occur when}} stable air is forced aloft at weather fronts and around centers of low pressure. Warm fronts associated with extratropical cyclones tend to generate mostly cirriform and stratiform clouds {{over a wide}} area unless the approaching warm airmass is unstable, in which case cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds will usually be embedded in the main precipitating <b>cloud</b> <b>layer.</b> Cold fronts are usually faster moving and generate a narrower line of clouds which are mostly stratocumuliform, cumuliform, or cumulonimbiform depending on {{the stability of the}} warm air mass just ahead of the front.|$|E
25|$|Sulfuric acid is {{produced}} in the upper atmosphere of Venus by the Sun's photochemical action on carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and water vapor. Ultraviolet photons of wavelengths less than 169nm can photodissociate carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and atomic oxygen. Atomic oxygen is highly reactive. When it reacts with sulfur dioxide, a trace component of the Venusian atmosphere, the result is sulfur trioxide, which can combine with water vapor, another trace component of Venus's atmosphere, to yield sulfuric acid. In the upper, cooler portions of Venus's atmosphere, sulfuric acid exists as a liquid, and thick sulfuric acid clouds completely obscure the planet's surface when viewed from above. The main <b>cloud</b> <b>layer</b> extends from 45–70km above the planet's surface, with thinner hazes extending as low as 30km and as high as 90km above the surface. The permanent Venusian clouds produce a concentrated acid rain, as the clouds in the atmosphere of Earth produce water rain.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{location}} of the upper two <b>cloud</b> <b>layers</b> is somewhat controversial. Methane clouds were directly detected by Voyager 2 at 1.2–1.3bar by radio occultation. This result was later confirmed by {{an analysis of the}} Voyager 2 limb images. The top of the deeper ammonia/hydrogen sulfide clouds were determined to be at 3bar based on the spectroscopic data in the visible and near-infra spectral ranges (0.5–1μm). However a recent analysis of the spectroscopic data in the wavelength range 1–2.3μm placed the methane cloudtops at 2bar, and the top of the lower clouds at 6bar. This contradiction may be resolved when new data on methane absorption in Uranus's atmosphere are available. The optical depth of the two upper <b>cloud</b> <b>layers</b> varies with latitude: both become thinner at the poles as compared to the equator, though in 2007 the methane <b>cloud</b> <b>layer's</b> optical depth had a local maximum at 45°S, where the southern polar collar is located (see below).|$|R
