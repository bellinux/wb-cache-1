5|$|After {{his return}} to London, Carte formed a new {{partnership}} with Gilbert and Sullivan to divide profits equally after the expenses of each of their shows. Meanwhile, Pinafore continued to play strongly. On 20 February 1880, Pinafore completed its initial run of 571performances. Only one other work of musical theatre in the world had ever run longer, Robert Planquette's operetta Les <b>cloches</b> de Corneville.|$|E
5|$|Different soil types suit {{different}} crops, but {{in general}} in temperate climates, sandy soils dry out fast but warm up quickly {{in the spring and}} are suitable for early crops, while heavy clays retain moisture better and are more suitable for late season crops. The growing season can be lengthened by the use of fleece, <b>cloches,</b> plastic mulch, polytunnels, and greenhouses. In hotter regions, the production of vegetables is constrained by the climate, especially the pattern of rainfall, while in temperate zones, it is constrained by the temperature and day length.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this time}} Henry Tippett decided {{to live in}} France, and the house in Wetherden was sold. The 15-year-old Michael and his brother Peter {{remained}} at school in England, travelling to France for their holidays. Michael found Stamford much more congenial than Fettes, and developed both academically and musically. He found an inspiring piano teacher in Frances Tinkler, who {{introduced him to the}} music of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert and Chopin. Sargent had maintained his connection with the school, and was present when Tippett and another boy played a C minor Concerto for Two Harpsichords by Bach on pianos with a local string orchestra. Tippett sang in the chorus when Sargent directed a local performance of Robert Planquette's operetta Les <b>Cloches</b> de Corneville. Despite his parents' wish that he follow an orthodox path by proceeding to Cambridge University, Tippett had firmly decided on a career as a composer, a prospect that alarmed them and was discouraged by his headmaster and by Sargent.|$|E

5000|$|The anglicised name {{is usually}} {{considered}} an error {{on the part}} of the British colonial Ordnance Survey which translated the village name; while <b>Cloch</b> certainly means [...] "stone" [...] or [...] "rock", Rón means [...] "seal", not [...] "round".

The bay is referred to as Round-stone Haven as early as 1684 (Roderick O'Flaherty), and the rock after which it is named stands like a marker at the entrance and is strikingly round.|$|R

The short circular-section tower has a corbelled walkway and triangular windows. The foghorns were added between 1895 and 1897.|$|R
