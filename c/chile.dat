5|$|Aureliano Oyarzún, {{professor}} of pathology at University of <b>Chile,</b> investigated pre-Ceramic middens from Pichilemu and Cahuil. His book Crónicas de Pichilemu–Cáhuil (Chronicles of Pichilemu–Cáhuil) was published posthumously, in 1957. Tomás Guevara published two volumes of Historia de <b>Chile,</b> <b>Chile</b> Prehispánico (History of <b>Chile,</b> Pre-Hispanic <b>Chile)</b> in 1929, which discusses the indigenous centre of Apalta, the Pichilemu middens, the Malloa petroglyphs, a stone cup from Nancagua, and pottery finds in Peralillo.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{involvement}} with the Pinochet government, there were international protests when Friedman was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1976. Friedman was accused of supporting the military dictatorship in <b>Chile</b> because of the relation of economists of the University of Chicago to Pinochet, and a controversial seven-day trip he took to <b>Chile</b> during March 1975 (less {{than two years after}} the coup that deposed President Salvador Allende). Friedman answered that he never was an adviser to the dictatorship, but only gave some lectures and seminars on inflation, and met with officials, including Augusto Pinochet, while in <b>Chile.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1891, a {{diplomatic}} crisis emerged in <b>Chile,</b> {{otherwise known as}} the Baltimore Crisis. The American minister to <b>Chile,</b> Patrick Egan, granted asylum to Chileans who were seeking refuge during the 1891 Chilean Civil War. Egan, previously a militant Irish immigrant to the U.S., was motivated by a personal desire to thwart Great Britain's influence in Chile; his action increased tensions between <b>Chile</b> and the United States, {{which began in the}} early 1880s when Secretary Blaine had alienated the Chileans in the War of the Pacific.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chiles</b> {{was born}} in Houston, the {{daughter}} of Marion Clay <b>Chiles</b> and Barbara Wayne Kirkland <b>Chiles.</b> Her father was the brother of oil tycoon and Texas Rangers owner Eddie <b>Chiles.</b> She had two brothers: Clay Kirkland <b>Chiles</b> (died 1979), and William Edmonds <b>Chiles,</b> president and CEO of Bristow Group, Inc, and was raised in Alice, Texas.|$|R

50|$|<b>Chiles</b> {{was born}} in 1904 in Baker City, Oregon, the son of Ira <b>Chiles</b> and Eva Chatfield. After his parents {{divorced}} in 1908, <b>Chiles</b> and his mother moved to Portland where Mrs. <b>Chiles</b> met and later married Fred Meyer.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, ampelographers began to {{distinguish}} Sauvignon blanc from Sauvignonasse plantings in <b>Chile.</b> The character of non-blended Chilean Sauvignon blanc are noticeably less acidic than the wines of New Zealand and {{more similar to}} the French style that is typical of Chilean wines. The region of Valparaíso is the most notable area for Sauvignon blanc in <b>Chile</b> due to its cooler climate which allows the grapes {{to be picked up}} to six weeks later than in other parts of <b>Chile.</b> In Brazil, ampelographers have discovered that the vines called Sauvignon blanc planted in the region are really Seyval blanc.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{volcanism}} in <b>Chile</b> {{is relative}} to subduction of the Nazca Plate; the <b>Chile</b> Ridge exhibits submarine volcanism, and volcanism in the Austral Volcanic Zone is {{triggered by the}} Antarctic Plate subducting beneath the South American Plate. One hundred ninety-eight South American volcanoes are on the Global Volcanism Program's Holocene volcano list.|$|E
5|$|Offshore {{volcanism}} also {{occurs in}} <b>Chile.</b> Intraplate volcanism {{generated from the}} Easter and Juan Fernández hotspots has formed many Chilean islands, including Isla Salas y Gómez, Easter Island, and the Juan Fernández Islands. Underwater volcanism occurs due to seafloor spreading along the <b>Chile</b> Ridge.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chiles</b> {{was married}} to Fran Hafer, and had two {{children}} from a previous marriage, Jerry Edmond <b>Chiles</b> and Carol Ann <b>Chiles</b> Ballard.|$|R

His {{father is}} the pianist Walter <b>Chiles,</b> who {{was the leader of}} the jazz trio <b>Chiles</b> & Pettiford in the 1960s and the 1970s funk band LTG Exchange. Atlantic Records {{released}} the 1965 <b>Chiles</b> & Pettiford recording [...] "Live at Jilly's." [...] Walter <b>Chiles</b> wrote the LTG Exchange's biggest hit, [...] "Waterbed." ...|$|R
50|$|Without {{leaving his}} job in Endesa, Saez joined Compania de Acero del Pacifico (CAP), <b>Chile's</b> largest steel {{manufacturing}} company, between 1944 and 1947 and played important roles in CORFO (<b>Chile's</b> corporation for industrial development), IANSA (<b>Chile's</b> national sugar company) and ENTEL (<b>Chile's</b> telecommunications company), among others.|$|R
5|$|Pichilemu was {{inhabited}} by Promaucaes, a pre-Columbian tribal group, until the Spanish conquest of <b>Chile.</b> They were hunter-gatherers and fishermen who lived primarily along the Cachapoal and Maule rivers. The remaining Promaucaes were assimilated into Chilean society {{through a process}} of hispanicisation and mestisation after the conquest of <b>Chile.</b>|$|E
5|$|Swiftsure {{was ordered}} by <b>Chile,</b> {{with the name}} of Constitución, in {{response}} to the Argentine purchase of two armoured cruisers from Italy during a time of heightened tensions with Argentina. After the crisis subsided, financial problems forced <b>Chile</b> put the ship up for sale in early 1903; concerned that Russia might buy them, the United Kingdom stepped in and purchased the still-incomplete ships from <b>Chile</b> on 3 December 1903 for £2,432,000. The ship was designed to Chilean specifications, particularly the requirement to fit in the graving dock at Talcahuano, and was regarded by the British as a second-class battleship.|$|E
5|$|The Captaincy General of <b>Chile</b> {{followed}} a process analogous {{to that of}} the May Revolution, and elected a Government Junta that inaugurated the brief period known as Patria Vieja. The Junta was defeated in 1814 at the Battle of Rancagua, and the subsequent Reconquista of <b>Chile</b> would make it a royalist stronghold once more. The Andes provided an effective natural barrier between the Argentine revolutionaries and <b>Chile,</b> so there was no military confrontation between them until the Crossing of the Andes, led by José de San Martín in 1817, a campaign that resulted in the defeat of the Chilean royalists.|$|E
50|$|Between 1970 and 1973 he was <b>Chile's</b> {{ambassador}} to the Vatican and between 1973 and 1978 was <b>Chile's</b> {{ambassador to}} Argentina, and later served as <b>Chile's</b> ambassador to Spain from 1978 to 1980.|$|R
50|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, <b>Chiles</b> went to the University of Oklahoma in Norman, OK. On her first day of college, <b>Chiles</b> met her first husband, Brian Conaghan. After two years, <b>Chiles</b> decided to leave college and marry Brian. The two moved to Tonkawa, OK. They joined the Young Republicans and <b>Chiles</b> became the {{secretary}} of the organization.|$|R

5|$|The {{victory in}} Chacabuco did not {{liberate}} all <b>Chile.</b> Royalist forces still resisted in southern <b>Chile,</b> {{allied with the}} mapuches. Las Heras occupied Concepción, but failed to occupy Talcahuano. The royalist resistance lasted for several months, and Talcahuano was only captured {{when most of the}} continent was already free.|$|E
5|$|The world's {{production}} of molybdenum was 250,000 tonnes in 2011, the largest producers being China (94,000t), United States (64,000t), <b>Chile</b> (38,000t), Peru (18,000t) and Mexico (12,000t). The total reserves are estimated at 10 million tonnes, and are mostly concentrated in China (4.3Mt), US (2.7Mt) and <b>Chile</b> (1.2Mt). By continent, 93% of world molybdenum production is about evenly shared between North America, South America (mainly in <b>Chile),</b> and China. Europe {{and the rest}} of Asia (mostly Armenia, Russia, Iran and Mongolia) produce the remainder.|$|E
5|$|An {{entirely new}} design {{incorporating}} the latest dreadnought technology was {{drawn up by}} J.R. Perrett, the head of Elswick Ordnance Company, {{and approved by the}} Brazilian government on 20 February 1907. Argentina and <b>Chile</b> immediately annulled the 1902 treaty that had ended their naval arms race, and both planned to expand their own navies, though <b>Chile</b> was delayed by a financial depression in 1907 and a major earthquake the next year.|$|E

5|$|<b>Chile</b> {{began to}} seek {{additional}} ships to bolster its fleet in 1919, and the United Kingdom eagerly offered {{many of its}} surplus warships. This action worried nearby nations, who feared that a Chilean attempt to become the region's most powerful navy would destabilize the area and start another naval arms race. <b>Chile</b> asked for Canada and Eagle, the two battleships they ordered before the war, {{but the cost of}} converting the latter back to a battleship was too high. Planned replacements included the two remaining s, but a leak to the press of the secret negotiations to acquire them caused an uproar within <b>Chile</b> itself over the value of such ships. In the end, <b>Chile</b> only bought Canada and four destroyers in April 1920—all ships that had been ordered from British yards by the Chilean government before 1914 but were purchased by the Royal Navy after the British entered the First World War—for relatively low prices. Canada, for instance, was sold for just £1,000,000, less than half of what had been required to construct the ship.|$|E
