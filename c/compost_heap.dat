Produced by Joel Shearer, the album {{contains}} twelve songs, five of which are co-written and co-produced by Irish folk musician Damien Rice. The album peaked at number 22 and number 35 on the Belgian Albums Charts and French Albums Charts respectively. She recorded the album with Rice, living between Woodstock, New York and his home in Ireland. In an interview, Laurent revealed that spending time at Rice's home in Ireland inspired her to maintain a <b>compost</b> <b>heap</b> and eat organic food.|$|E

25|$|In 1999 Loevy {{expanded}} his scope to tackle a new issue that was {{rising to the}} forefront of Israeli consciousness: environmentalism. Fourteen Footnotes to a Garbage Mountain was a documentary film about the Hiriya, once Israel's national garbage dump, on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. To Israelis, however, the Hiriya is more than a dumpsite. It is a physical landmark—a flat-topped mountain (87 m)—towering over the heavily urbanized coastal plain and the Ayalon River. Loevy succeeded in capturing the world of the Hiriya in its final days, as it was transformed from a dump to a recycling center and national park. He documented life around the site, and the art that sprouted up from its role—once mocked—as a national <b>compost</b> <b>heap.</b>|$|E

25|$|Biopolymers are {{biodegradable}}, {{and some}} are also compostable. Some biopolymers are biodegradable: they are broken down into CO2 and water by microorganisms. Some of these biodegradable biopolymers are compostable: they can be put into an industrial composting process and will break down by 90% within six months. Biopolymers that do this can be marked with a 'compostable' symbol, under European Standard EN 13432 (2000). Packaging marked with this symbol can be put into industrial composting processes and will break down within six months or less. An example of a compostable polymer is PLA film under 20μm thick: films which are thicker than that do not qualify as compostable, {{even though they are}} biodegradable.

60|$|Bob assented, {{and each}} went his way. Mark threw the loam into a wheelbarrow, of which Friend Abraham had put {{no less than}} three in the ship, as {{presents}} to the savages, and he wheeled it, at two or three loads, into the crater, where he threw it down in a pile, intending to make a <b>compost</b> <b>heap</b> of all the materials of the sort he could lay his hands on.|$|E
60|$|It being {{a matter}} of some moment to save {{unnecessary}} labour, Mark seldom cooked more than once in twenty-four hours, and then barely enough to last for that day. In consequence of this rule, he soon learned how little was really necessary for the wants of one person, it being his opinion that a quarter of an acre of such soil as that which now composed his garden, would more than furnish all the vegetables he could consume. The soil, it is true, was of a very superior quality. Although it had lain so long unproductive and seemingly barren, now that it had been stirred, and air and water were admitted, and guano, and sea-weed, and loam, and dead fish had been applied, and all in quantities that would have been deemed very ample in the best wrought gardens of christendom, the acre he had under tillage might be said to have been brought to the highest stage of fertility. It wanted a little in consistency, perhaps; but the <b>compost</b> <b>heap</b> was very large, containing enough of all the materials just mentioned to give the garden another good dressing. As for the grass, Mark was convinced the guano was all-sufficient for that, and this he took care to apply as often as once in two or three months.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we model the thermal {{behaviour}} of <b>compost</b> <b>heaps</b> {{in the presence}} of micro-organism undergoing oxidative exothermic reactions. For simplicity we consider a spatially uniform model in which oxidative reactions of the cellulosic components is ignored. We use singularity theory to investigate the generic properties of the model. We show that there are two generic steady-state diagrams including one in which the temperature-response curve is the standard S-shaped curve familiar from combustion problems. Such a steady-state diagram contains an elevated temperature branch, which is the feature of practical interest in facilities such as industrial <b>compost</b> <b>heaps</b> and municipal tips. Thus biological self-heating can cause jumps in the steady-temperature. We outline a procedure by which reasonable values of the kinetic parameters can be estimated...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} Mark had {{settled on a}} system which he thought to pursue. There was no use in his raising more pigs than he could use. Taking care to {{preserve}} the breed, therefore, he killed off the pigs, {{of which he had}} fresh litters, from time to time; and when he found the old hogs getting to be troublesome, as swine will become with years, he just shot them, and buried their bodies in his <b>compost</b> <b>heap,</b> or in his garden, where one common-sized hog would render highly fertile several yards square of earth, or ashes. This practice he continued ever after, extending it to his fowls and ducks, the latter of which produced a great many eggs. By rigidly observing this rule, Mark avoided an evil which is very common even in inhabited countries, that of keeping more stock than is good for their owner. Six or eight hens laid more eggs than he could consume, and there was always a sufficient supply of chickens for his wants. In short, our hermit had everything he actually required, and most things that could contribute to his living in great abundance. The necessity of cooking for himself, and the want of pure, cold spring water, were the two greatest physical hardships he endured. There were moments, indeed, when Mark would have gladly yielded one-half of the advantages he actually possessed, to have a good spring of living water. Then he quelled the repinings of his spirit at this privation, by endeavouring to recall how many blessings were left at his command, compared to the wants and sufferings of many another shipwrecked mariner of whom he had read or heard.|$|E
6000|$|By {{the middle}} of April, for I made no haste in my work, but rather {{made the most of}} it, my house was framed and ready for the raising. I had already bought the shanty of James Collins, an Irishman who worked on the Fitchburg Railroad, for boards. James Collins' shanty was {{considered}} an uncommonly fine one. When I called to see it he was not at home. I walked about the outside, at first unobserved from within, the window was so deep and high. It was of small dimensions, with a peaked cottage roof, and not much else to be seen, the dirt being raised five feet all around {{as if it were a}} <b>compost</b> <b>heap.</b> The roof was the soundest part, though a good deal warped and made brittle by the sun. Doorsill there was none, but a perennial passage for the hens under the door board. Mrs. C. came to the door and asked me to view it from the inside. The hens were driven in by my approach. It was dark, and had a dirt floor for the most part, dank, clammy, and aguish, only here a board and there a board which would not bear removal. She lighted a lamp to show me the inside of the roof and the walls, and also that the board floor extended under the bed, warning me not to step into the cellar, a sort of dust hole two feet deep. In her own words, they were [...] "good boards overhead, good boards all around, and a good window"--of two whole squares originally, only the cat had passed out that way lately. There was a stove, a bed, and a place to sit, an infant in the house where it was born, a silk parasol, gilt-framed looking-glass, and a patent new coffee-mill nailed to an oak sapling, all told. The bargain was soon concluded, for James had in the meanwhile returned. I to pay four dollars and twenty-five cents tonight, he to vacate at five tomorrow morning, selling to nobody else meanwhile: I to take possession at six. It were well, he said, to be there early, and anticipate certain indistinct but wholly unjust claims on the score of ground rent and fuel. This he assured me was the only encumbrance. At six I passed him and his family on the road. One large bundle held their all--bed, coffee-mill, looking-glass, hens--all but the cat; she took to the woods and became a wild cat, and, as I learned afterward, trod in a trap set for woodchucks, and so became a dead cat at last.|$|E
60|$|Some of the time, moreover, Betts {{passed in}} fishing, {{supplying}} not only Mark and himself, but the pigs and the poultry, {{with as much}} food as was desired. Several of the fish caught {{turned out to be}} delicious, while others were of a quality that caused them to be thrown into the <b>compost</b> <b>heap.</b> A cargo of guano was also imported, the rich manure being mixed up in liberal quantities with the loam. At {{the end of the first}} week of these voyages to 'loam-rock,' Betts went out to fish in a new direction, passing to windward of the 'sea-wall,' as they called the reef that protected the ship, and pulling towards a bit of naked rock a short distance beyond it, where he fancied he might find a particular sort of little fish, that greatly resembled the Norfolk Hog-fish, one of the most delicious little creatures for the pan that is to be found in all the finny tribe. He had been gone a couple of hours, when Mark, who was at work within the crater, picking up the encrusted ashes that formed its surface, heard Bob's shout outside, as if he wished assistance. Throwing down the pick, our young man ran out, and was not a little surprised to see the sort of cargo with which Bob was returning to port. It would seem that a great collection of sea-weed had formed to windward of the rock where Bob had gone to fish, at which spot it ordinarily gathered in a pile until the heap became too large to lodge any longer, when, owing to the form of the rock, it invariably broke adrift, and passed to the southward of the Reef, floating to leeward, to fetch up on some other rock, or island, in that direction. Bob had managed to get this raft round a particular point in the reef, when the wind and current carried it, as near as might be, directly towards the crater. He was calling to Mark to come to his assistance, to help get the raft into a sort of bay, ahead of him, where it might be lodged; else would there be the danger of its drifting past the Reef, after all his pains. Our young man saw, at once, what was wanted, got a line, succeeded in throwing it to Bob, and by hauling upon it brought the whole mass ashore in the very spot Betts wished to see it landed.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} a sustainable alternative to grow crops using organic wastes as biofertilizers. Fresh fish waste (FFW) and cooked fish waste (CFW) mixed with sawdust from Tryplochyton scleroxylon wood species (Wawa) were made into <b>compost</b> <b>heaps.</b> Control <b>compost</b> from rice bran (CRB) was also prepared. Higher temperatures were recorded from <b>compost</b> <b>heaps</b> prepared from both FFW (38 - 52 °C) and CFW (37 - 52 °C) than from CRB (33 - 45 °C); with reduction in composting time and generation {{of large numbers}} of microorganisms in the fish-based <b>compost</b> <b>heaps.</b> Mycelial colonization of compost bags and subsequent growth of oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus species) were faster in fish-based substrates (FFW and CFW) as compared to CRB. P. eous and P. oestreatus exhibited uniform spread of mycelia in the compost bags than P. eous hybrid. However, P. eous hybrid produced the fastest rate of mycelial growth, completely colonizing the substrate within 26 days. Growth of each species of mushroom investigated was independent of the substrate in which it was grown. Irrespective of the substrate used to grow the mushroom, the pattern of utilization and growth remained the same. Oyster mushrooms grown on fish-based substrates produced bigger and firmer fruiting bodies. This alternative could be very attractive to small farmers throughout the world, who are known to operate under adverse conditions and limited resources...|$|R
60|$|When Mark {{found his}} health {{completely}} re-established, {{he sat down}} and drew up a regular plan of dividing his time between work, contemplation, and amusement. Fortunately, perhaps, for one who lived in a climate where vegetation was so luxuriant when it could be produced at all, work was pressed into his service as an amusement. Of the last, there was certainly very little, in the common acceptation of the word; but our hermit was not without it altogether. He studied the habits of the sea-birds that congregated in thousands around so many of the rocks of the Reef, though so few scarce ever ventured on the crater island. He made voyages to and fro, usually connecting business with pleasure. Taking favourable times for such purposes, he floated several cargoes of loam to the Reef, as well as two enormous rafts of sea-weed. Mark was quite a month in getting these materials into his <b>compost</b> <b>heap,</b> which he intended should lie in a pile during the winter, in order that it might be ready for spading in the spring. We use these terms by way of distinguishing the seasons, though of winter, strictly speaking, there was none. Of the two, the grass grew better at mid-winter than at mid-summer, the absence of the burning heat of the last being favourable to its growth. As the season advanced, Mark saw his grass very sensibly increase, not only in surface, but in thickness. There were now spots of some size, where a turf was forming, nature performing all her tasks in that genial climate, in about a fourth of the time it would take to effect the same object in the temperate zone. On examining these places, Mark {{came to the conclusion that}} the roots of his grasses acted as cultivators, by working their way into the almost insensible crevices of the crust, letting in air and water to places whence they had hitherto been excluded. This seemed, in particular, to be the case with the grass that grew within the crater, which had increased so much in the course of what may be termed the winter, that it was really fast converting a plain of a light drab colour, that was often painful to the eyes, into a plot of as lovely verdure as ever adorned the meadows of a Swiss cottage. It became desirable to keep this grass down, and Kitty being unable to crop a meadow of so many acres, Mark was compelled to admit his pigs and poultry again. This he did at stated times only, however; or when he was at work himself in the garden, and could prevent their depredations on his beds. The rooting gave him the most trouble; but this he contrived in a great measure to prevent, by admitting his hogs only when they were eager for grass, and turning them out as soon as they began to generalize, like an epicure picking his nuts after dinner.|$|E
