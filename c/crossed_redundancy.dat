40|$|Abstract: Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a {{mathematical}} programming method {{for the assessment}} of relative efficiency of a set of Decision Making Units (DMUs) that use several inputs to produce several outputs. It measures the efficiency of each Decision Making Unit (DMU) by maximizing the ratio of virtual output to virtual input with the constraint that the ratio does not exceed one for each DMU. Standard DEA models (radial or non-radial) project under evaluation DMU onto efficient frontier, using decrease its inputs and/or increase its outputs. In the case that one output variable has a linear dependence (conic dependence, to be precise) with the other output variables, it can be hypothesized that the addition or deletion of such an output variable would not change the efficiency estimates. This is also the case for input variables. However, in the case that a certain set of input and output variables is linearly dependent, the effectless of such a dependency on DEA discussed by Lee and Choi, they called such a dependency a <b>cross</b> <b>redundancy</b> and examined the effect of a <b>cross</b> <b>redundancy</b> on DEA. They proved that the addition or deletion of a cross-redundant variable does not affect the efficiency estimates yielded by the CCR or BCC models [2]. In this paper, according to modifying the basic DEA models using facet analysis by Daneshvar [1], we examine the effect of a <b>cross</b> <b>redundancy</b> on the modified input-oriented BCC model using facet analysis. We prove that the addition or deletion of a cross-redundant variable does not affect the efficiency estimates yielded by the modified input-oriented BCC model.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that data envelopment {{analysis}} (DEA) models are sensitive to selection of input and output variables. As the number of variables increases, the ability to discriminate between the decision making units (DMUs) decreases. Thus, to preserve the discriminatory power of a DEA model, the number of inputs and outputs should be kept at a reasonable level. There are many cases in which an interval scale output in the sample is derived from the subtraction of nonnegative linear combination of ratio scale outputs and nonnegative linear combination of ratio scale inputs. There are also cases in which an interval scale input is derived from the subtraction of nonnegative linear combination of ratio scale inputs and nonnegative linear combination of ratio scale outputs. Lee and Choi (2010) called such interval scale output and input a <b>cross</b> <b>redundancy.</b> They proved that the addition or deletion of a cross-redundant output variable does not affect the efficiency estimates yielded by the CCR or BCC models. In this paper, we present an extension of <b>cross</b> <b>redundancy</b> of interval scale outputs and inputs in DEA models. We prove that the addition or deletion of a cross-redundant output and input variable does not affect the efficiency estimates yielded by the CCR or BCC models...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we applied both linear and {{nonlinear}} spatial correlation measures to charac-terize epicardial activation patterns of sustained atrial fibrillation in instrumented conscious goats. It was investigated if nonlinearity {{was involved in the}} spatial coupling of atrial regions and to what extent fibrillation was organized in the experimental model of sustained atrial fibrillation (AF) in instrumented goats. Data were collected in five goats during experiments to convert AF by continuous infu-sion of cibenzoline. Spatial organization during AF was quantified with the linear spatial cross correlation function and the nonlinear spatial <b>cross</b> <b>redundancy</b> which was calculated using the Grassberger–Procaccia correlation integral. Two different types of correlation were evaluated to distinguish simultaneous interaction from non–simultaneous interaction, for in-stance resulting from propagation of fibrillation waves.

40|$|Lee and Choi (2010) {{proved that}} a cross {{redundant}} output in a CCR or BCC DEA study is unnecessary {{and can be}} eliminated from the model without affecting {{the results of the}} study. A cross redundant output, as characterized by Lee and Choi, can be expressed as a specially constrained linear combination of both some outputs and some inputs. This article extends the contributions of Lee and Choi (2010) in at least three ways: (i) by adding precision and clarity to some of their definitions; (ii) by introducing specific definitions that complement the ones in their paper; and (iii) by conducting some additional analysis on the impact of the presence of other types of linear dependencies among the inputs and outputs of a DEA model. One reason {{that it is important to}} identify and remove cross redundant inputs or outputs from DEA models is that the computational burden of the DEA study is decreased, especially in large applications.

40|$|The {{approach}} to library services {{provided in the}} literature on Service Operations and Service Management has long been acknowledged. In this paper we take the generic view that library services production may be seen as the transformation of inputs into outputs as argued in that literature. The main objective of the paper is to empirically examine how does the transformation take place along time. We collected data on a convenience sample of 37 library units pertaining to a federal university in Brazil during 2000 - 2007 and then applied Canonical Analysis to identify significant links among inputs and outputs. Results show that - for each year {{as well as for the}} whole time period - two significant (p < 5 %) correlations were obtained and that the yearly measure of <b>cross</b> <b>redundancy</b> varied between 51 % and 67 %, a quite good “explaining power” since data come from a cross section of observational units.

40|$|Reversible logic {{circuits}} are {{emerging as a}} promising technology for power minimization. Parity preserving reversible circuits design will be very important for development of fault tolerant reversible systems in nanotechnology. In this paper, a fast fault tolerant reversible signed multiplier is proposed. In order to construct the multiplier, five variables parity preserving gate (F 2 PG) and modified new fault tolerant (MNFT) are designed, which are parity preserving reversible gates. The most significant aspect of F 2 PG {{is that it can}} work independently as a reversible fault tolerant full adder. Meanwhile, it can implement all Boolean functions. MNFT can reduce <b>cross</b> <b>redundancy.</b> The quantum implementations of F 2 PG and MNFT are also given. Otherwise, a new quantum implementation of the modified Islam gate (MIG) is presented. The Wallace tree is applied to improve the operating speed of the multiplier, which can implement the multiplication of two 5 -bit binary signed numbers. Simulation and evaluation results indicate that the multiplier logic structure is correct with excellent performance.

40|$|International audienceAnion channels/transporters {{are key to}} a wide {{spectrum}} of physiological functions in plants, such as osmoregulation, cell signaling, plant nutrition and compartmentalization of metabolites, and metal tolerance. The recent identification of gene families encoding some of these transport systems opened the way for gene expression studies, structure-function analyses of the corresponding proteins, and functional genomics approaches toward further understanding of their integrated roles in planta. This review, based on a few selected examples, illustrates that the members of a given gene family exhibit a diversity of substrate specificity, regulation, and intracellular localization, and are involved {{in a wide range of}} physiological functions. It also shows that post-translational modifications of transport proteins play a key role in the regulation of anion transport activity. Key questions arising from the increasing complexity of networks controlling anion transport in plant cells (the existence of <b>redundancy,</b> <b>cross</b> talk, and coordination between various pathways and compartments) are also addressed...|$|R
40|$|Two-component phosphorelay {{systems are}} {{minimally}} comprised of a histidine kinase (HK) component, which autophosphorylates {{in response to}} an environmental stimulus, and a response regulator (RR) component, which transmits the signal, resulting in an output such as activation of transcription, or of a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. The genomes of the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Candida albicans encode one, three, and three HKs, respectively. In contrast, the genome sequences of the filamentous ascomycetes Neurospora crassa, Cochliobolus heterostrophus (Bipolaris maydis), Gibberella moniliformis (Fusarium verticillioides), and Botryotinia fuckeliana (Botrytis cinerea) encode an extensive family of two-component signaling proteins. The putative HKs fall into 11 classes. Most of these classes are represented in each filamentous ascomycete species examined. A few of these classes are significantly more prevalent in the fungal pathogens than in the saprobe N. crassa, suggesting that these groups contain paralogs required for virulence. Despite the larger numbers of HKs in filamentous ascomycetes than in yeasts, all of the ascomycetes contain virtually the same downstream histidine phosphotransfer proteins and RR proteins, suggesting extensive <b>cross</b> talk or <b>redundancy</b> among HKs...|$|R

The frameworks with multiple image-domain motion aligned temporal filtering at various spatial resolutions, named as multi-T+ 2 D, are mainly investigated. First we investigate a multi-T+ 2 D scheme based on redundant frame representation. The <b>cross</b> spatial layer <b>redundancy</b> and prediction methods are discussed. The redundancy brings significant performance loss for schemes providing wide range SNR spatial scalability. To remove the redundancy produced in the multi-resolution temporal filtering while retaining the advantage of spatial-domain motion compensation, a novel non-redundant multi-T+ 2 D scheme is proposed. Performance comparison is given among the discussed frameworks and {{it shows that the}} proposed non-redundant multi-T+ 2 D framework has a good performance for fully scalable video coding. We also verify that the redundant multi-T+ 2 D framework with cross spatial layer reconstruction feedback is practical in providing narrow range SNR scalability for each spatial layer.

Methods:We have employed phylogenetic and syntenic reconstruction methods to determine the chronology of the duplication events that generated the three paralogs and have performed genetic <b>crosses</b> to evaluate <b>redundancy</b> in mice. Results: Our analyses indicate that USP 4 and USP 15 arose from whole genome duplication prior to the emergence of jawed vertebrates. Despite having lower sequence identity USP 11 was generated later in vertebrate evolution by small-scale duplication of the USP 4 -encoding region. While USP 11 was subsequently lost in many vertebrate species, all available genomes retain a functional copy of either USP 4 or USP 15, and through genetic crosses of mice with inactivating mutations we have confirmed that viability is contingent on a functional copy of USP 4 or USP 15.

40|$|The {{cyanobacterium}} Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 forms single heterocysts {{about every}} 10 to 15 vegetative cells along filaments. PatS {{is thought to}} be a peptide intercellular signal made by developing heterocysts that prevents neighboring cells from differentiating. Overexpression of the patS gene suppresses heterocyst formation. The hetL gene (all 3740) was isolated in a genetic screen to identify genes involved in PatS signaling. Extracopy hetL allowed heterocyst formation in a patS overexpression strain. hetL overexpression from a heterologous promoter in wild-type Anabaena PCC 7120 induced multiple-contiguous heterocysts (Mch) in nitrate-containing medium. The predicted HetL protein is composed almost entirely of pentapeptide repeats with a consensus of A(D/N) L*X, where * is a polar amino acid. Thirty Anabaena PCC 7120 genes contain this repeat motif. A synthetic pentapeptide corresponding to the last 5 amino acids of PatS, which suppresses heterocyst formation in the wild type, did not suppress heterocyst formation in a hetL overexpression strain, indicating that HetL overexpression is affecting heterocyst regulation downstream of PatS production. The transcription regulator NtcA is required for the initiation of heterocyst formation. hetL overexpression allowed the initiation of heterocyst development in an ntcA-null mutant, but differentiation was incomplete. hetR and hetC mutations that block heterocyst development are epistatic to hetL overexpression. A hetL-null mutant showed normal heterocyst development and diazotrophic growth, which could indicate that it is not normally involved in regulating development, that it normally plays a nonessential accessory role, or perhaps that its loss is compensated by <b>cross</b> talk or <b>redundancy</b> with other pentapeptide repeat proteins...|$|R
