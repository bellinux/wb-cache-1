A detailed understanding of their effects depends upon knowledge of the dynamic rigidity cutoffs imposed by the changing total magnetic field. For {{the first time we}} investigate detailed comparisons between theoretical cutoff rigidities and ground-based measurements during the large geomagnetic disturbance of 4 - 10 November 2001. We make use of the imaging riometer (IRIS) at Halley, Antarctica, fortunately situated such that the rigidity cutoff sweeps {{back and forth across the}} instrument's field of view during the SPE period. The Kp-dependent geomagnetic 2 rigidity <b>cutoff</b> <b>energies</b> are determined from satellite observations combined with previously reported particle-tracing results. We find that the predicted absorption levels show good agreement with those experimentally observed for low and mid levels of geomagnetic disturbance (Kp< 5). However, during more disturbed geomagnetic conditions the cutoff modeling over-estimates the stretching of the geomagnetic field, under-estimating the rigidity <b>cutoff</b> <b>energies,</b> and hence leading to riometer absorption predictions that are too high. In very disturbed conditions (Kp≈ 7 - 9) the rigidity <b>energy</b> <b>cutoffs</b> indicated by the IRIS observations appear to be equivalent to those predicted for Kp≈ 6 by the particle-tracing approach.

5000|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that active galactic nuclei {{are capable of}} converting dark matter into high energy protons. Yuri Pavlov and Andrey Grib at the Alexander Friedmann Laboratory for Theoretical Physics at St. Petersburg hypothesize that dark matter particles are about 15 times heavier than protons, {{and that they can}} decay into pairs of heavier virtual particles of a type that interacts with ordinary matter. Near an active galactic nucleus, one of these particles can fall into the black hole, while the other escapes, as described by the Penrose process. Some of those particles will collide with incoming particles; these are very high energy collisions which, according to Pavlov, can form ordinary visible protons with very high energy. Pavlov then claims that evidence of such processes are ultra-high-energy cosmic ray particles. Ultra-high energy cosmic ray particles may also be produced by the decay of super-heavy dark matter [...] "X particles" [...] such as Holeums. Such very energetic decay products, carrying a fraction of the mass of the X particle, are believed to be a plausible explanation for the observed ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR). High energy cosmic ray particles traversing intergalactic space suffer the GZK cutoff above 1020 eV due to interactions with cosmic background radiation if the primary cosmic ray particles are protons or nuclei. The Pierre Auger Project, HiRes and Yakutsk Extensive Air Shower Array found the GZK cutoff, while Akeno-AGASA observed the events above the cutoff (11 events in the past 10 years). The result of the Akeno-AGASA experiment is smooth near the GZK <b>cutoff</b> <b>energy.</b> If one assumes that the Akeno-AGASA result is correct and consider its implication, a possible explanation for the AGASA data on GZK cutoff violation would be a shower caused by dark matter particles. A dark matter particle is not constrained by the GZK cutoff, since it interacts weakly with cosmic background radiation. Recent measurements by the Pierre Auger Project have found a correlation between the direction of high energy cosmic ray particles and the location of AGN.|$|E

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of the pulsars detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) display spectra with exponential cutoffs falling in a narrow range around a few GeV. Early spectral modelling predicted spectral <b>cutoff</b> <b>energies</b> of up to 100 GeV. More modern studies estimated spectral <b>cutoff</b> <b>energies</b> in the 1 - 20 GeV range. It was therefore not expected that pulsars would be visible in the very-high-energy (VHE; > 100 GeV) regime. The VERITAS detection (confirmed by MAGIC) of pulsed emission from the Crab pulsar up to 400 GeV (and now possibly up to 1 TeV) therefore raised important questions about our understanding of the electrodynamics and local environment of pulsars. H. E. S. S. has now detected pulsed emission from the Vela pulsar in the 20 - 120 GeV range, making this the second pulsar detected by a ground-based Cherenkov telescope. We will review the latest developments in VHE pulsar science, including an overview of recent observations and refinements to radiation models and magnetic field structures.
