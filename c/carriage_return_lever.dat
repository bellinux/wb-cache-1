[...] Like a manual typewriter, it has two side knobs to advance paper through the machine and a <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> <b>lever</b> above the keys. [...] The rollers that hold and advance the paper have grooves designed to avoid crushing the raised dots the brailler creates.|$|E

50|$|Another {{problem is}} scripts {{containing}} a <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> character {{immediately after the}} shebang, perhaps {{as a result of}} being edited on a system that uses DOS line breaks, such as Microsoft Windows. Some systems interpret the <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> character as part of the interpreter command, resulting in an error message.|$|R

5000|$|Business {{and public}} {{administration}} was improved and simplified {{with the introduction}} of the typewriter, which acquired a familiar standardized form by about 1910, which features the [...] "qwerty" [...] keyboard, the typebar, ribbon, cylinder and <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> <b>lever.</b> Popular models in Canada were manufactured by the US Remington and Underwood companies, among others. The introduction of the mechanical desk calculator complemented that of the typewriter. Most machines used in Canada were manufactured in the US by companies such as Friden, Monroe, and SCM/Marchant. The Gestetner copy machine, which used the stencil technique to reproduce copies of documents, was invented in England in 1881 by David Gestetner and quickly became popular in offices around the world, including those in Canada.|$|E
50|$|Like the Perkins, the Mountbatten has a key {{corresponding}} {{to each of}} the six dots of the braille code. By simultaneously pressing different combinations of the six keys, users can create any of the characters in the braille code. In addition to these six keys, the Mountbatten has a space key, a backspace key, and a new line key. Like a manual typewriter, it has a knob to advance paper through the machine, although unlike the Perkins the bar does not move. There is a Return key rather than a <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> <b>lever.</b> The rollers that hold and advance the paper have grooves designed to avoid crushing the raised dots the brailler creates.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{mechanical}} printers {{were too}} slow to <b>return</b> the <b>carriage</b> {{in the time it}} took to process one character. Therefore, the time spent sending the line feed was not wasted (often several more characters had to be sent to ensure the <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> had happened before sending a printing character). This is why the <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> was always sent first.|$|R
50|$|Acorn MOS {{does provide}} two other OS calls that handle text output: OSNEWL and OSASCI. OSNEWL writes a line feed and <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> {{to the current}} output stream. OSASCI {{forwards}} all characters directly to OSWRCH except for <b>carriage</b> <b>return,</b> which triggers a call to OSNEWL instead. The precise code for OSASCI and OSNEWL five lines of 6502 assembler is documented in the BBC Micro User Guide.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{computer}} programs use the <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> character, {{alone or with}} a line feed, to signal {{the end of a}} line of text, but other characters are also used for this function (see newline); others use it only for a paragraph break (a [...] "hard return"). Some standards which introduce their own representations for line and paragraph control (for example HTML) and many programming languages treat <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> and line feed as whitespace.|$|R

These characters {{are based on}} printer commands: The line feed indicated that one line of paper should feed out of the printer thus instructed the printer to advance the paper one line, and a <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> indicated that the printer <b>carriage</b> should <b>return</b> {{to the beginning of}} the current line. Some rare systems, such as QNX before version 4, used the ASCII [...] (record separator, , 30 in decimal) character as the newline character.|$|R
