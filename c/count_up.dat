This brought Lochte's Olympic medal <b>count</b> <b>up</b> to 12 total, making him the second most decorated male Olympic swimmer of all time, second only to Phelps.|$|E

5|$|The F-28s had {{the largest}} {{regularity}} problems, mostly due {{to the number of}} landings, which could <b>count</b> <b>up</b> to 16 per day. For instance, LN-SUO flew 36,000 hours with 76,000 landings. The last flight was made on 16 December 1986, and the aircraft sold for NOK45 million each. Although the F-28 was taken out of service, some of the routes on the West Coast needed to be operated with smaller aircraft than the 737. The company made an agreement to wet lease Busy Bee F-27s one some of the routes, while the most trafficked ones would be taken over by 737s.|$|E

Some studies, such as one done at Moscow State University, have suggested that crows may indeed have a true numerical ability. It has been shown that parrots can <b>count</b> <b>up</b> to 6.|$|E

25|$|The {{manner of}} {{timekeeping}} in Australian rules football is unusual {{compared with other}} sports, in that the timekeepers keep track of time using a count-down clock which begins at 20 minutes and is stopped during any time-on; but, clocks displayed at the ground <b>count</b> <b>up</b> from zero and are not stopped during time-on. As such, spectators and players present at the ground never know exactly how much time is left in the game.

25|$|The Nazis {{considered}} the Slavs as subhuman, or Untermenschen. In a secret memorandum dated 25 May 1940, Heinrich Himmler {{stated that it}} was in German interests to foster divisions between the ethnic groups in the East. He also wanted to restrict non-Germans in the conquered territories to schools that would only teach them how to write their own name, <b>count</b> <b>up</b> to 500, and obey Germans. Himmler's Generalplan Ost (General Plan East), agreed to by Hitler in the summer of 1942, involved exterminating, expelling, or enslaving all or most Slavs from their lands over a period of 20–30 years to make living space for Germans. In 1992 Rudolph Rummel estimated the number of Slavs murdered by the Germans to be 10,547,000.|$|E
25|$|Points are scored {{based on}} the tricks won in the hand. There {{are several ways to}} <b>count</b> <b>up</b> the points for play, but they always add up to 250 points. The last trick is always worth an {{additional}} 10 points added to any existing points in the actual trick cards. The classic counting system of pinochle is where aces are worth 11, tens are worth 10, kings are worth four, queens are worth three, jacks are worth two, and nines are worth zero. This method takes longer to count the score {{at the end of each}} hand. A simpler method is to count aces and tens for 10 points, kings and queens for five points, and jacks and nines are worth zero.|$|E
25|$|Exit numbers {{correspond}} to Interstate mileage markers in most states. On I‑19 in Arizona, however, length {{is measured in}} kilometers instead of miles because, {{at the time of}} construction, a push for the United States to change to a metric system of measurement had gained enough traction that it was mistakenly assumed that all highway measurements would eventually be changed to metric; proximity to metric-using Mexico may also have been a factor, as I‑19 indirectly connects I‑10 to the Mexican Federal Highway system via surface streets in Nogales. Mileage count increases from west to east on most even-numbered Interstates; on odd-numbered Interstates mileage count increases from south to north. Some highways, including the New York State Thruway, use sequential exit-numbering schemes. Exits on the New York State Thruway <b>count</b> <b>up</b> from Yonkers traveling north, and then west from Albany.|$|E
