5|$|In May 1985, {{designers}} {{started work}} on the F1 project. In late 1985, designers presented the first exterior study models to F1 management, featuring a sports car-like design with a low-slung hood and narrow front profile. By 1986, the sedan used a three-box design with an upright stance, more prominent grille, and a two-tone body. Extensive modeling and wind tunnel tests resulted in a low drag coefficient for a <b>conventional</b> <b>production</b> vehicle of the time (C'd 0.29). For the passenger cabin, the materials-selection tests evaluated 24 different kinds of wood and multiple types of leather {{for two years before}} settling on specific trim combinations. By 1986, the Lexus marque was created to support the launch of the flagship sedan, and the vehicle became known as the Lexus LS. Following eight design reviews, subsequent revisions, concept approval in September 1986, and over US$1 billion in development expenses, the final design for the production Lexus LS 400 (chassis code UCF10) was frozen in May 1987 with design patents filed on 13 May 1987.|$|E
500|$|Wind power gives {{variable}} power {{which is very}} consistent {{from year to year}} but which has significant variation over shorter time scales. It is therefore used in conjunction with other electric power sources to give a reliable supply. As the proportion of wind power in a region increases, a need to upgrade the grid, and a lowered ability to supplant <b>conventional</b> <b>production</b> can occur. Power management techniques such as having excess capacity, geographically distributed turbines, dispatchable backing sources, sufficient hydroelectric power, exporting and importing power to neighboring areas, or reducing demand when wind production is low, can in many cases overcome these problems. In addition, weather forecasting permits the electric power network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur. Blyth's [...] high, cloth-sailed wind turbine was installed in the garden of his holiday cottage at Marykirk in Kincardineshire and was used to charge accumulators developed by the Frenchman Camille Alphonse Faure, to power the lighting in the cottage, thus making it the first house in the world to have its electric power supplied by wind power. Blyth offered the surplus electric power to the people of Marykirk for lighting the main street, however, they turned down the offer as they thought electric power was [...] "the work of the devil." [...] Although he later built a wind turbine to supply emergency power to the local Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary and Dispensary of Montrose the invention never really caught on as the technology was not considered to be economically viable.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Conventional</b> <b>production</b> of oil has peaked, conservatively, between 2007 and 2010. In 2010, it was {{estimated}} that an investment in non-renewable resources of $8 trillion would be required to maintain current levels of production for 25 years. In 2010, governments subsidized fossil fuels by an estimated $500 billion a year. [...] Fossil fuels are also a source of greenhouse gas emissions, leading to concerns about global warming if consumption is not reduced.|$|E

30|$|The third {{main reason}} for the {{difference}} in forecasts in Fig.  1 is in the historical production data used. From Table  1, {{we can see that}} most forecast models are curve-fitting models, which means the short-term trend of the forecast curve will be affected by historical production data. In China’s oil industry, there are no separate statistics for non-conventional oil production. Therefore, the total historical oil production data are usually seen as the historical <b>conventional</b> oil <b>production</b> by most researchers when they forecast Chinese <b>conventional</b> oil <b>production.</b> That is why many conventional oil forecast curves fit the total historical oil production data well in Fig.  1. The study of Wang et al. (2015) is the first study known to us that breaks out the <b>conventional</b> oil <b>production</b> and non-conventional oil production separately, by collecting the non-conventional oil production data from various sources (See Fig.  1). It can be seen from Table  1 that <b>conventional</b> oil <b>production</b> growth rate becomes significantly lower if non-conventional oil production is excluded from the total oil production. However, at present, it is unrealistic to exclude those estimates [including, for example, Wang and Feng (2016)] that use the total historical production data since they hold a dominant position, and we still lack high-quality <b>conventional</b> oil <b>production</b> data.|$|R
30|$|For the {{historical}} gas production data, {{similar to that}} of the oil production data, there are no separate statistics for non-conventional gas from China’s authorities (Wang et al. 2016 c). Current studies therefore usually use total gas <b>production</b> as the <b>conventional</b> gas <b>production.</b> Wang et al. (2016 c) first presented a comprehensive investigation of historical production gas data from various sources, and then, for the first time, the <b>conventional</b> gas <b>production</b> data were obtained by excluding the non-conventional gas production from the total production data. As can be seen in Fig.  4, most of the forecast production curve fits the total production data curve well, rather than the <b>conventional</b> gas <b>production</b> curve.|$|R
2500|$|A 2012 {{report from}} the European Commission states that, unlike the United States, [...] "Shale gas {{production}} will not make Europe self-sufficient in natural gas. The best case scenario for shale gas development in Europe {{is one in which}} declining <b>conventional</b> <b>production</b> can be replaced and import dependence maintained at a level of around 60%." [...] There is a divergence of opinion among the Weimar Triangle countries with regard to shale gas development. France has introduced a ban, because of the risks connected to the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process, while Germany has suspended operations awaiting further environmental assessments.|$|E
