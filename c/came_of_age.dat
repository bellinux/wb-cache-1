5|$|John de Vieuxpont died in 1241, {{before he}} <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> The new heir, John's son Robert, was {{not old enough}} to inherit, so the family's lands {{remained}} in wardship. During this time, the estates fell into disrepair, and this probably included Brougham Castle. When Robert de Vieuxpont <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> in around 1257 he inherited considerable debts. He {{was one of the}} northern lords that revolted in support of Simon de Montfort in the Second Barons' War (1264–1267). By June 1264, Vieuxpont was dead; as he was considered a traitor, his property was confiscated by King HenryIII. In 1266, the king pardoned Vieuxpont posthumously, and his two daughters inherited the family estates. The guardians of the two girls, who at the time were too young to marry, divided the Vieuxpont lands with the expectation that they would come into their possession through marriage. Isabel Vieuxpont was given in marriage to Roger Clifford, the son of her guardian, and with her the shrievalty of Westmorland and the castles of Brougham and Appleby transferred to the Cliffords.|$|E

5|$|In 1892, Du Bois {{received}} a fellowship from the John F. Slater Fund for the Education of Freedmen {{to attend the}} University of Berlin for graduate work. While a student in Berlin, he traveled extensively throughout Europe. He <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> intellectually in the German capital, while studying with some of that nation's most prominent social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller, Adolph Wagner, and Heinrich von Treitschke. After returning from Europe, Du Bois completed his graduate studies; in 1895 {{he was the first}} African American to earn a Ph.D. from Harvard University. His dissertation was The Suppression of the African Slave Trade to the United States of America, 1638–1871.|$|E

5|$|Mary Beatrice d'Este, {{the second}} but eldest {{surviving}} child of Alfonso IV, Duke of Modena, and his wife, Laura Martinozzi, {{was born on}} 5 October 1658 NS in Modena, Duchy of Modena, Italy. Her only younger brother, Francesco, succeeded their father as Duke upon the latter's death in 1662, the year Mary turned four. Mary and Francesco's mother, Laura, was strict with them and acted as regent of the duchy until her son <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> Mary's education was excellent; she spoke French and Italian fluently, had a good knowledge of Latin and, later, mastered English.|$|E
5|$|Once the new king, Edward III, <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> {{and assumed}} {{personal}} control of government, he annulled {{the charges against}} his uncle. The title and estates of the Earl of Kent descended on Edmund's son, also called Edmund. When this Edmund died, in 1331, his brother John became earl. Though he was officially exonerated, Edmund did not enjoy a great reputation during his life and afterwards, due to his unreliable political dealings.|$|E
5|$|Pleydell {{was born}} by 1519. The sixth of nine children, {{he was the}} fourth son of wealthy tenant farmer William Pleydell of Coleshill, Berkshire—now Oxfordshire—and Agnes Reason (daughter of Robert Reason of Corfe Castle, Dorset). His younger brother was John Pleydell, Member for Cricklade in 1593. The Pleydell family were thought to descend from Thomas de Coleshill, a knight who was awarded lordship of the eponymous parish on 2 March 1275 by King Edward I. Gabriel <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> by 1540, holding land once owned by Sir Anthony Hungerford at Eisey (near the parish of Cricklade).|$|E

5|$|Robert's father, William Tatton, {{drowned in}} the River Mersey when Robert was 10 years old. As the only male heir Robert {{inherited}} his father's estate in Wythenshawe, but as a minor he was made a ward of the king, Charles I, until he <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> On 9January 1628, Robert married Anne Brereton, the third daughter of William Brereton of Ashley. The couple went on to have four sons and two daughters.|$|E
5|$|When Ping died on 3 February 6 AD, Ruzi Ying (d. 25 AD) {{was chosen}} as the heir and Wang Mang was {{appointed}} to serve as acting emperor for the child. Wang promised to relinquish his control to Liu Ying once he <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> Despite this promise, and against protest and revolts from the nobility, Wang Mang claimed on 10 January that the divine Mandate of Heaven called {{for the end of the}} Han dynasty and the beginning of his own: the Xin dynasty (9–23 AD).|$|E
5|$|When he {{ascended to}} the throne, Pedro II was {{only five years}} old. Until he <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> and {{would be able to}} exert his {{constitutional}} powers, a regency was created. It proved to be weak and to have little effective authority, which led the nation into anarchy, ravaged by political faction struggles and countless rebellions. Exploited as a tool by rival political factions in pursuit of their own interests, Pedro II was manipulated into accepting an early elevation to majority status on 22 July 1840 at age 14, thus putting an end to nine years of chaotic regency rule.|$|E

5|$|A royal hunting park {{close to}} Melbourne was {{probably}} created by King John around 1200, and the King {{is known to}} have stayed at the manor house on at least five occasions. John gave the manor and its lands to Hugh Beauchamp, although they appear to have soon reverted to the crown, being gifted by Henry III to Bishop Walter Mauclerk of Carlisle in about 1230. The estate returned to the crown on the bishop's death in 1248, and Henry granted the land to his son, Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster, in 1265. At some later date, the manor appears to have been granted to a Philip Marc, before passing to Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, the King's son. This was in 1298 when he <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> his father having died two years earlier. Early references to the house itself are rare, but there are records of repairs to the gutters in 1246 and to the roof of the King's Chamber in 1248.|$|E
5|$|As King William {{intensely}} {{disliked the}} Duchess and Conroy, {{he vowed to}} wait until Victoria <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> to die simply {{to keep them from}} a regency. In 1831, the year of William's coronation, Conroy and the Duchess embarked on a series of royal tours with Victoria to expose her to the people and solidify their status as potential regents. On one trip Conroy was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Oxford. Their efforts were ultimately successful and, in November 1831, it was declared that the Duchess would be sole regent in the event of Victoria's young queenship, while Conroy could claim to be the closest adviser to the Duchess and her daughter.|$|E
5|$|Edward II's close {{relationship}} to Gaveston {{had been a}} source of conflict at court, and Gaveston's execution by a group of rebellious barons in 1312 had brought the country to the brink of civil war. As Edmund <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> he became an important member of the circle around his brother. In 1318, the Treaty of Leake was drafted as an effort to reconcile the opposing parties, and Edmund – as his first public act – was among the witnesses to sign this treaty. Further official appointments followed. In the spring of 1320 he took part in an embassy to Pope John XXII in Avignon, where the mission was to absolve the king of his oath to uphold the Ordinances, a set of restrictions imposed on royal authority by the baronage. Later that year, he joined his brother the king in Amiens, where Edward was paying homage to the French king. In October 1320, Edmund attended his first parliament.|$|E

5|$|Mason {{was born}} in 1725, most likely {{in what is now}} Fairfax County, Virginia. His father died when he was young, and his mother managed the family estates until he <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> He married in 1750, built Gunston Hall, and lived the life of a country squire, supervising his lands, family, and slaves. He briefly served in the House of Burgesses and {{involved}} himself in community affairs, sometimes serving with his neighbor George Washington. As tensions grew between Britain and the American colonies, Mason came to support the colonial side, and used his knowledge and experience to help the revolutionary cause, finding ways to work around the Stamp Act of 1765 and serving in the pro-independence Fourth Virginia Convention of 1775 and the Fifth Virginia Convention of 1776.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rana Bahadur Shah's youth {{had been}} spent in pampered luxury. In 1794 Rana Bahadur <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> {{and his first}} act was to re-constitute the government, with his uncle, Bahadur Shah, removed from all {{official}} position. In mid 1795, he became infatuated with a Maithili Brahman widow, Kantavati Jha, and married her on the oath of making their illegitimate half-caste son (as per the Hindu law of that time) the heir apparent, by excluding the legitimate heir from his previous marriage. By 1797, {{his relationship with his}} uncle, who was living a retired life, and who wanted to seek refuge in China on the pretext of meeting the new emperor, had deteriorated {{to the extent that he}} ordered his imprisonment on 19 February 1797 and his subsequent murder on 23 June 1797. Such acts earned Rana Bahadur notoriety both among courtiers and common people, especially among Brahmins.|$|E
5|$|Michael de la Pole {{had been}} {{instrumental}} in the marriage negotiations; he had the king's confidence and gradually became more involved at court and in government as Richard <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> De la Pole came from an upstart merchant family. When Richard made him chancellor in 1383, and created him Earl of Suffolk two years later, this antagonised the more established nobility. Another member of the close circle around the king was Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, who in this period emerged as the king's favourite. Richard's close friendship to de Vere was also disagreeable to the political establishment. This displeasure was exacerbated by the earl's elevation to the new title of Duke of Ireland in 1386. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham suggested {{the relationship between the}} king and de Vere was of a homosexual nature, due to a resentment Walsingham had toward the king.|$|E
