25|$|As {{with most}} members of the <b>composite</b> <b>family,</b> the actual flowers appear in two {{different}} froms: as ray florets, which have strap-like appendages that look like petals and project around the outside of the capitulum, and as disc florets, which appear {{at the center of the}} flower head and are very small. The ray florets number between 5 and 10, though as many as 12 may be present. Their straps are white and measure 6 to 12mm long by 1.5 to 2.2mm wide. The disc florets number from 12 to 19 and up to 25 and have yellow corollas (i.e. petals, though they are fused into a tube) that are 4.1 to 4.8 and exceptionally 5.5mm long. Their corollas are abruptly ampliate, or enlarged, with tubes that are longer than their campanulate throats. The tubes measure 2.3 to 2.6mm while the throats are typically only 0.9 to 1.2mm long. The lobes, i.e. the friges of the throat, are reflexed and lanceolate in shape, measuring 0.7 to 1.4mm.|$|E
2500|$|José Eduardo Tavares Silva: In {{this case}} a second family name has been added. In theory the first surname (Tavares) would come from {{the mother and the}} second one (Silva) from the father, but it could be reversed. Another {{possibility}} would be that [...] "Tavares Silva" [...] is a <b>composite</b> <b>family</b> name, because this is relatively common in Portuguese surnames, i.e., both names are carried down to all descendants. Hyphenated names are rare in Portuguese, e.g., [...] "Tavares-Silva," [...] a convention which would dispel the confusion. Sometimes this convention is artificially forced by authors, politicians, etc., who want to be correctly cited in other countries. For comparison, this convention is more common in Spanish, although it is nowhere near prevalent there, either.|$|E

40|$|The inhomogeneities {{situated}} in materials render the diversification of <b>composite</b> <b>families,</b> and can provide synergistic effects for tailoring materials to a specified and often hostile environment. The work presented here {{focuses on the}} fracture and stress analysis of systems with various inhomogeneities. In Chapter 1, interactions among cracks and rigid-line inclusions are investigated. Rigid-line inclusions are represented by a distribution of forces while cracks are modeled by the standard dislocation approach. Chapter 2 presents an analysis of composite systems with interacting cracks and a dilute distribution of inclusions. A damage analysis procedure is developed to evaluate the effective properties of such composites. Chapter 3 examines multiple void-crack interactions. The formulation {{is based on a}} mixture of dislocations and tractions. Chapter 4 presents an approach to modeling bridged crack systems. A fully regular integral equation formulation is developed and the approach is ideally suited for the analysis of systems with large number of closely spaced inhomogeneities. The integral equations of different forms, developed throughout the dissertation can also be utilized to evaluate and verify various micromechanical models. The possible future extensions and the major limitations of the present work are briefly discussed in Chapter 5...|$|R

40|$|After the {{successful}} application of composite materials on drag braces and trailing arms, Fokker Landing Gear B. V. (FLG) {{is interested in}} further developing their <b>composite</b> product <b>family.</b> Therefore it set out an assignment {{for the development of}} a conceptual design of a composite main fitting of a cantilever type nose landing gear. This assignment has been conducted at FLG from the 23 rd of March 2015 to the 22 nd of January 2016. The main fitting of the nose landing gear of the NH- 90 helicopter has been chosen as reference design. Through the use of analytical and numerical methods and tools, a conceptual design is developed which shows the technical feasibility of a composite main fitting. It was furthermore shown that a small size and highly specialized main fitting, as found on the NH- 90, does not result in a feasible business case. The weight savings are limited in comparison to its metal equivalent, and the manufacturing costs of the components are high. It is shown that the business case becomes more feasible for large main fittings, as found on medium to large commercial aircraft. Larger and thus heavier composite components are proven to be more cost-efficient. A case study has shown that the design is scalable with relative ease. It is thus recommended to investigate the potential of such large main fittings. This research has provided insight in future opportunities for the <b>composite</b> product <b>family</b> and has given FLG an outline of the conditions in which a composite main fitting could achieve a feasible business case.

40|$|We {{continue}} our study of Coleman-Weinberg symmetry breaking induced {{by a third}} rank antisymmetric tensor scalar, {{in the context of}} the SU(8) model we proposed earlier. We focus in this paper on qualitative features that will determine whether the model can make contact with the observed particle spectrum. We discuss the mechanism for giving the spin 3 / 2 field a mass by the BEH mechanism, and analyze the remaining massless spin 1 / 2 fermions, the global chiral symmetries, and the running couplings after symmetry breaking. We note that the smallest gluon mass matrix eigenvalue has an eigenvector suggestive of U(1) _B-L, and conjecture that the theory runs to an infrared fixed point at which there is a massless gluon with 3 to - 1 ratios in generator components. Assuming this, we discuss a mechanism for making contact with the standard model, based on a conjectured asymmetric breaking of Sp(4) to SU(2) subgroups, one of which is the electroweak SU(2), and the other of which is a "technicolor" group that binds the original SU(8) model fermions, which play the role of "preons", into composites. Quarks can emerge as 5 preon composites and leptons as 3 preon composites, with consequent stability of the proton against decay to a single lepton plus a meson. A composite Higgs boson can emerge as a two preon composite. Since anomaly matching for the relevant conserved global symmetry current is not obeyed by three fermion families, emergence of three <b>composite</b> <b>families</b> requires formation of a Goldstone boson with quantum numbers matching this current, which can be a light dark matter candidate.
