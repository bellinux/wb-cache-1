40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} role of product design on technology switching {{in the context of}} a <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>product.</b> I focus on switching rather than on new sales because switching is the primary means of changing market share in nearly mature markets. Further, the dominant logic — is that, because of switching costs and the related consequences, incumbents have a strong advantage when upgrading or replacing equipment. However, the literature on lead users suggests that those users at the cutting-edge are willing to meet the costs of changing technology because they have the capabilities needed to leverage significant advantages from the new technology. The extant literature on switching focuses primarily on consumers in highly competitive markets. There is little understanding of the antecedents of switching in business markets, especially in markets for capital-intensive technology-based products. This research investigates the influence of product design on switching behavior for capital-intensive high technology products, where buyers are faced with numerous implications and significant costs at each step of the process. The switching behavior for capital-intensive products has not been studied previously; because of this deficiency, we do not know the consequences for theory, that is, how different theoretical assumptions will contribute to the final decision to switch, or for managerial practice, that is, the kind of strategies managers should follow to retain existing buyers under such conditions. Previous literature did not explore explicitly the concept of product design as an influence on switching, because satisfaction and switching cost were widely used as determinants of switching decisions in competitive markets. This gap in knowledge is due to the difficulty in identifying a method that would allow one to differentiate among the products’ performance and how the difference would impact consumers’ objectives. It is also difficult for researchers to define the characteristics of high technology products that make certain products more attractive on the market than others, without substantial assistance from experts in particular products. These conditions create a barrier to investigating switching behavior for high technology products. This research is positioned in the overlapping area between product design and switching behavior. The linkage between these two bodies of literature has never been explored. The research answers two important questions: (1) what are the antecedents of technology switching in a context where there are considerable costs?, and (2) does product design encourage technology switching behavior? Dynamic capabilities theory is used to explain this research, because the decision to switch an old technology for a new one in rapidly changing technology markets is about renewing resources and capabilities to maintain competitive advantages. This research is conducted in the context of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) industry as a case study. Considerable switching has occurred in this industry over the last decade, resulting in this industry offering a good opportunity to investigate the reasons why. The market is divided into different segments based on the region and the health care system. I selected the university hospitals segment, MRI research centers, to conduct this research study, because it is feasible to track the technology switching process for this segment over time and because this segment’s market is nearly mature. Data were collected from multiple sources including personal interviews, online surveys, annual conference database, product technical reports, and patent data. In this study, the independent variable is product design and other variables related to switching costs and marketing strategies. The dependent variable is switching behavior, which has two values: (1) “switched,” defined as purchasing a new technology from a different supplier, and (2) “not switched,” defined as repurchasing from the same supplier. After collecting surveys from decision makers who purchased MRI technology, I use logistic regression analysis to test the hypothesis that the product design has a direct impact on the switching decision of capital-intensive products. Research findings have shown that buyers are willing to switch to a different technology in spite of high associated costs, particularly when they are faced with a product that restricts their capabilities. Product design represents the most influential factor underpinning switching, because it provides more capabilities that motivate switching. Notwithstanding the fact that moving to a new supplier imposes significant challenges, including technology and relationship incompatibility, findings confirm that this distinction in product capabilities has induced some MRI buyers to move to a new supplier in order to maintain a competitive market position. The findings also confirm that support during the transition process can be achieved through marketing strategies. The findings of this research clarify our understanding of the switching behavior of capital-intensive products where successful product design is expected to play a significant role. This behavior is expected to be different from the behavior identified in previous research, because the previous research was conducted using mainly competitive markets with frequently purchased products. For lead users faced with products that restrict their capabilities, switching is an expected option despite high switching costs. Those early switchers, having capitalized on the real value of the new product, serve to encourage other users to pursue the same behavior later. The outcomes from this MRI study — as one example of a high technology device — could be applied to the different industries that share the same characteristics in terms of high rates of technological change and high switching costs, for example, military devices, aircrafts, and advanced medical and industrial devices. 1 yea...|$|E
50|$|The Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem, {{which is}} {{concluded}} from the Heckscher-Ohlin model of international trade, states: trade between countries is {{in proportion to}} their relative amounts of capital and labor. In countries {{with an abundance of}} capital, wage rates tend to be high; therefore, labor-intensive products, e.g. textiles, simple electronics, etc., are more costly to produce internally. In contrast, <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>products,</b> e.g. automobiles, chemicals, etc., are less costly to produce internally. Countries with large amounts of capital will export <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>products</b> and import labor-intensive products with the proceeds.

40|$|With the spurt of {{technology}} and innovation the life cycles of parts and products have become shorter and service parts enter their final phases earlier. Final phase of a typical service part starts once the part production is ceased and ends when the last service or warranty contract expires. One popular tactic, in practice, to sustain service operations is placing a final order. The prime challenge of a firm while deciding a final order quantity is to minimize inventory-carrying costs together with the risk of obsolescence {{at the end of}} the planning period. In this study, end-of-life inventory decisions for an array of products including both consumer electronics and <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>products</b> are investigated. For consumer electronics we show that considering an alternative service policy, such as swapping the defective product with a new one, besides a regular repair policy improves cost efficiency. Moreover, for <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>products</b> we study systems with phase-out returns and systems with customer differentiation in the end-of-life phase. Our analysis reveals that taming the uncertainty associated with phase-out arrivals engenders a remarkable efficiency improvement. Moreover, including rationing decisions in the end-of-life phase enhances the performance of the system by a significant reduction in cost and risk of obsolescence...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Economic {{liberalization}} in Eastern Europe allows {{access to}} a superior foreign technology. The initial adoption of the new technology {{is limited by the}} adaptability of current Eastern productive inputs to Western technologies. Further adoption is limited by the rate of Eastern investment in suitable inputs. Both the immediate amount and the continuing flow of adoption can be increased if capital is available from Western sources. Privatization that {{takes the form of a}} forced transfer of assets to the advanced sector is not necessarily desirable if all assets are not fully transferable. If the initial Eastern capital/labor ratio is high enough, it is desirable to allocate some of the new entrants in the labor force into the state-supported backward sector even as all new capital investment is placed in the advanced sector. Generally the East should concentrate its product mix on the <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>products</b> using the backward technology and the labor-intensive products usingthe advanced technology. If privatization is the only option, it is better to privatize the labor-intensive sector, or more accurately the sector that uses intensely those inputs that are most readily transferable to the advanced technology. Becauseof the preservation of the capital-intensive state-supported sector, the East may initially export the <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>products</b> made with the backward technology. Over time, with capital accumulation and depreciation, the product mix and the trademix will shift in favor of the labor-intensive product made with the advanced technology. ...|$|R

It shows that intra-industry trade in manufactured products expanded as Japan increased imports of more <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>products</b> from these countries. Intra-industry trade of intermediate inputs increased substantially more than of final products, reflecting a trend by manufacturers to subdivide the production process of intermediate inputs and to shift their locations to different countries. This suggests a more active development of international labor in the intermediate stages of production and a deepening of regional linkages. ...|$|R

On the other hand, {{a major part of the}} macro-economic change in the capital-labor ratio and the change in the skilled-labor ratio can be attributed to a within-industry shift rather than a between-industry shift.

Using an industry panel dataset over the period 1980 – 2010, we exploit variations of worker skill categories by occupation, paired with detailed information and communication technology investment data in the employment share regression. We find that while the PRC’s comparative advantages in exports have shifted from labor-intensive to more <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>products,</b> this has not resulted in substituting skilled workers in Japanese manufacturing. Rather, it has had the profound positive effect of raising overall demand for skilled workers.

Two factors have been consistently important to this process: openness to the international economy and domestic market liberalization.

For a latecomer like China, modern industry initially finds its most success in more labor-intensive products that require only modest capabilities. Gradual upgrading entails the shift into more skilled-labor and <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>products</b> and processes.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} Free Trade Agreements on income distribution within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and between the members and their trading partners outside ASEAN. The study uses a Computable General Equilibrium model, {{a modified version of}} the 57 sector, 87 country, Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) integrated model of national input-output tables, version- 6. 2 (2001 database) with its reserve matrix facility, to simulate income distribution results as an outcome of certain parameter changes that appear in intra and inter regional trade. Within ASEAN, trade liberalization will stimulate the output of each country within the region according to their comparative advantage. Since trade liberalization tends to increase output of capital-intensive goods more than labor-intensive goods, the less-developed countries within the region tend to get smaller benefits compared to other member countries. In addition, the physical means of production tend to gain more relative to the gains of labor from the FTAs. This tends to widen the income gap between high-income and low-income households within ASEAN. Comparing ASEAN and the developed non-ASEAN countries, an FTA within ASEAN tends to reduce the returns to labor of the developed non-member countries and narrow the income gap between ASEAN, as a whole, and those rich countries since <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>products</b> of developing countries are often labor-intensive goods of developed countries.

Both static and dynamic shift-share models are employed to the 2 -digit ISIC 3 of manufacturing section to investigate the changing patterns of export share that result from the shift effect, consisting industry-mix, export growth and interdependence. Findings from shift-share analysis shows China gained most of the US market share for exporting not only labour-intensive goods but also <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>products</b> {{at the expense of}} ASEAN. The static analysis suggests that China and Indonesia had difficulties in their industrial structures whereas Singapore and Malaysia experienced structural advantages. However, the dynamic analysis result shows that in 2001 the difficulties faced by China and Indonesia had disappeared, which indicated such an improvement in export structures had been made while Singapore and Malaysia, on contrary, lost their structural advantages. With respect to competitive effect, both static and dynamic analyses reveal that China’s competitive advantage was extremely strong compared to ASEAN. Indonesia was the best performer amongst ASEAN, mainly corresponding to solid competitive advantage in exporting ISIC 32, which is relatively labour-intensive products to the US market.

40|$|Should India's export {{promotion}} policies {{be targeted}} at accelerating export growth at the extensive(new trading relationships) {{or at the}} intensive margin (increase in trade of existing relationships) ? To help answer this question, we undertake a comparative study of exports from India and China by analysing the role of extensive and intensive margins in the export market penetration {{of the two countries}} during 1995 - 2011. We further decompose intensive margin into quantity and price margins. As far as extensive margin is concerned, our results show that the gap between the two countries is getting narrower as India is clearly catching up with China. By contrast, India lags significantly behind China in terms of intensive margin due to an abysmally low and stagnant quantity margin. Intensification, rather than diversification, has been the crucial driving force of China's export success. India's exports of <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>products</b> performed better compared to labour intensive products. The lacklustre performance in labour-intensive exports is entirely {{due to a lack of}} depth in India's market presence even as it expanded the range of its products and markets.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} Bulgaria's {{industrial}} restructuring through the lenses of its evolving specialization in international division oflabor and integration into international markets {{with a special}} emphasis on EU markets. Its major findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Developments in Bulgaria's exports, its major drivers and factor content, during the"second transition"following the 1996 crisis have become reminiscent of developments in the early 1990 s in European transition economies that have stayed the reform course. (2) The evolution of Bulgaria's total exports in terms of factor intensities before the"second transformational"recession was a testimony to aborted economic reforms. It not only defied expectations derived {{from the experience of}} CEEC- 10 economies and its production factor endowments but also dramatically increased the cost of adjustment to market conditions for the economy as a whole. (3) Exports of unskilled labor-intensive products continue towering over other exports even during the current expansionary phase. The composition of top performers in EU markets indicates the shift toward natural resource and <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>products.</b> Bulgaria's export offer in EU markets has begun shifting toward more processed goods, mostly products of electro-engineering sectors. Bulgarian producers have made significant strides in information communication technology products and automotive parts. Trade in parts and engineering products has displayed strong growth. The returns usually associated with liberal reforms, that is, gains in competitiveness combined with a shift toward products in line with the country's endowments in production factors began to surface only recently. In contrast to the period preceding the second transformational recession in 1996 - 97, gains in competitiveness derive from corporate and industrial restructuring and not from subsidies.

40|$|Hungary has {{achieved}} impressive results in reorienting both its production and trade. Between 1989 and 1992, {{as the former}} CMEA marketscollapsed and Hungary liberalized imports and the exchange rate regime, exports to the European Union (EU) expanded, with manufactured exports redirected largely to Western (mostly EU) markets. During this first phase of expansion, characterized by a dramatic reorientation and explosion of trade, the value of Hungary's exports increased 84 percent. In 1993 export expansion lost steam and EU-oriented exports fell 12 percent. In a second phase of expansion (in 1994 - 97), driven by restructured and rapidly changing export offers, exports again registered strong performance, their value increasing 132 percent. There was a dramatic shift from an export basket dominated by resource-intensive, low-value-added products to one driven by manufacturers, with a rapidly accelerating growth of engineering products. Machinery and transport equipment rose from 12 percent of exports to the EU in 1989 to more that 50 percent in 1997. The shift from natural resource and unskilled-labor-intensive products to technology - and <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>products</b> in EU-oriented exports - suggests the potential for integration higher in the value-added spectrum. More stringent EU environmental regulations will affect a relatively low, and falling, share of Hungary's exports. The Hungarian share of environmentally"dirty"products imported by the EU has increased, but these products have not been trendsetters among Hungarian exports, their share in exports falling from 26 percent in 1989 to 16 percent in 1996. The rapid pace of Hungary's turnaround seems to reflect the emergence of second-generation firms, mostly foreign-owned. Foreign-owned firms {{tend to be more}} export-oriented.

40|$|Trade {{structure}} is usually defined as inter or intra-industrial type. The pattern {{of production and}} trade that emerges after opening the economies of transition is partly driven by relative factor prices and endowment and partly by economies of scale and scope, but much depends on historical experiences.

The more dissimilar are countries endowment, the greater the volume of inter-trade will be. This concept of trade is based on Heckser-Ohlin theorem.

Economic theory predicts that the volume of intra-industry trade depends of two groups of determinants; first group is related to country and second to the industry. Determinants relate to the country are: level of the economic development, size of the market, distance between countries, trade orientation, economic integration and trade barriers. In this paper will be analyze some of before mentioned determinants.

40|$|Traditional {{sourcing}} {{arrangements for}} after-sales support of <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>products</b> such as airplanes, weapons systems, and manufacturing equipment have centered around physical assets such as spare parts, {{which were the}} unit of financial transactions. In recent years, we have witnessed {{the emergence of a}} new service contracting strategy called Performance-Based Logistics (PBL). Under PBL, the basis of supplier compensation is actual service outcome, such as uptime of the product. In this dissertation, we study three major issues that practitioners in the aerospace and defense industry are facing today. In the first part of the dissertation, we introduce a multitask principal-agent model to support resource allocation and use it to analyze commonly observed contracts. In our model the customer (principal) faces a product availability requirement for the “uptime” of the end product. The customer then offers contracts contingent on availability to n suppliers (agents) of the key subsystems used in the product, who in turn exert cost reduction efforts and set service parts inventory investment levels. We find that the optimal contract combines a fixed payment, a cost-sharing incentive, and a performance incentive. Furthermore, we study how these contracts evolve over the product deployment life cycle as uncertainty in support cost changes. The second part of the dissertation compares the inefficiencies arising under the traditional (pre-PBL or material contract) and the PBL contract, and their respective impacts on motivating the supplier to improve product reliability. We find that the PBL contract provides stronger incentives to invest in reliability improvements than does the material contract. Moreover, our analysis supports a DoD recommendation for transforming suppliers into total service providers of support services who, under the PBL arrangement, assume complete control of service functions, including asset ownership. In the third part of the dissertation, we investigate how the infrequent nature of product failures impact efficiency of PBL contracting. We show that a seemingly innocuous choice of performance measures used in contracts may create unexpected incentives, resulting in counterintuitive optimal contract structures. We also find that, paradoxically, a firm that values high product reliability may also have to cope with excessive contracting costs. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: As {{the market}} becomes more {{competitive}} and fast-paced, efficient productivity becomes {{an increasingly important}} success factor for a high-technology factory, especially in semiconductor manufacturing. Semiconductor manufacturing is a very <b>capital-intensive</b> business with <b>product</b> life-cycles that are continuously compressed. Queuing theory logistics laws and simulation are applied at the Melaka back-end factory, where the concentration is to enhance {{the efficiency of the}} production system and to improve capacity with minimal equipment additions. Discrete-event simulation was used at a semiconductor backend site to analyze optimum lot size for the factory based upon the throughput and cycle time. The study has demonstrated that a larger lot size is very much desirable in the areas of the factory that are highly utilized. In addition simulation enables managers and planners to carry out “what if ” analysis to plan for the future. ...|$|R

Doing so requires employees perform {{tasks that are}} relatively more complex in comparison with other industry sectors. Employee job satisfaction, a surrogate measure of organizational effectiveness/performance, is an important management index for practitioners and researchers. However, the impact that task value and goal orientations, as perceived by employees during task execution, have on individual and organizational effectiveness/performance has not received sufficient attention {{in the context of}} high-tech firms. This study integrated two theories, expectancy-value and achievement goal, to explore the effect of task value and goal orientation on high-tech employee job satisfaction. After surveying 156 respondents in six Taiwan-based multinational high-tech manufacturers, results show that task value and goal orientation affect employee job satisfaction in the high-tech sector positively. Findings provide guidance to managers for improving employee job satisfaction and in-depth insights for researchers interested to test or further develop organizational development theories...|$|R

International capi tal flows allow for changes in the industrial structure of a country depends on the composition of the products produced in that coun try. More <b>capital-intensive</b> types of <b>products</b> produced by a country, the greater the need for capital and the higher marginal rate of capital that can be given to attract greater International capital flows. Therefore, a comparative advantage should be seen as dynamic rather than static. As a country with large population, Indonesia tends to specialize in labor -intensive products. The other hand, efforts to attract foreign direct investment are very intensively conducted. The estimation results indicate if there was a shift in the pattern of industrial specialization Indonesia, from labor –intensive tends toward capital intensive...|$|R

In {{this new}} era, state capital will lose its dominance of pillar industries such as iron and steel, automobile, petrochemicals, non-ferrous metal, insurance, telecommunication, banking, wholesale, and utilities. This study uses a computable general equilibrium model of China to estimate the economic benefits from China opening its pillar industries to private foreign and domestic capital. The study anticipates that lowering direct entry barriers to private capital will boost productivity by encouraging new competition and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into these industries. In this study, the productivity gains from lowering direct entry barriers to FDI and domestic private capital are empirically estimated through a historical simulation of opening the light manufacturing industries. The opening of the light manufacturing industries to private capital happened in the early 1990 s following a major policy shift marked by Deng Xiaoping's southern tour. From 1992, this policy shift led to a surge in China's inward FDI flows. The productivity gains estimated from the historical simulation are then used to simulate the opening of the pillar industries following China's WTO entry in 2001. As a result of the expected productivity gains in these pillar industries, this study concludes that WTO accession will not adversely affect production and employment in the pillar manufacturing industries, such as the automobile and parts industry. This result contrasts with the findings of most general equilibrium analyses of China's WTO entry that focus on the removal of tariffs and non-tariff barriers to merchandise trade. In the long term, productivity gains related to WTO accession should place China in a position to become an important production base for <b>capital-intensive</b> manufactured <b>products</b> as well as light manufacturing.

40|$|In {{a highly}} {{competitive}} environment, high-tech firms utilize <b>capital-intensive</b> facilities, technology-intensive <b>products,</b> and computer applications for gaining competitive advantages. It makes employees acquire more knowledge to perform more complex tasks. This has resulted in an increasing demand for organizations to implement knowledge management systems (KMS) for employees to steer organizational learning in the new era of knowledge-based economy. However, prior empirical examinations on factors influencing KMS success are not sufficient, particularly in the high-tech context. This study formulates and empirically tests a theoretical model to explain these factors and how they affect KMS success. Results from a sample of 141 employees selected from four high-tech semiconductor manufacturing firms provide us a more comprehensive understanding about how benefits, self-produced, and costs factors (i. e., reward, computer self-efficacy, and perceived power security) affect KMS success. It {{can be seen that}} reward and perceived power security have both direct and indirect effects on user satisfaction and intention to use KMS through perceived usefulness and ease of use. Moreover, computer self-efficacy influences user satisfaction and intention to use KMS through perceived usefulness and ease of use. Besides providing directions for development and testing of knowledge management theories, these findings will be valuable to practitioners...|$|R
40|$|Trade {{liberalization}} and international economic integration are major and important issues especially {{to developing countries}} including Vietnam. They have provided the country with many opportunities such as foreign investment projects from developed countries, {{an increase in the}} State budget through taxation on exports and imports, the higher level of employment, which have all contributed to improving the standard living of the people. Since the country's Reform (Doi Moi) in 1986, trade liberalization has brought about an increase export value from 0. 78 billion USD in 1986 to more than 72 billion USD in 2010 which accounted for an average of 70 % increase to the GDP of Vietnam. Moreover, Vietnamese firms are becoming increasingly {{aware of the importance of}} innovation and this is becoming the main driver for Vietnam's deeper participation in regional and global economic integration organization such as ASEAN and WTO. Exports play an important role in Vietnam’s international trade, helping to increase the national revenue and to improve the position of Vietnamese firms in the global value chain. Such an improvement of Vietnam's position in the global value chain means being higher in the chain rather than carrying out simple processing at the low-end. If the production factors which include labor, capital, and fixed assets are analyzed in relation to firms' exports, plausible assessments of Vietnamese firms' contributions to the global chain can be determined. It should be also noted that the country's trade policy reform has affected the structure of Vietnam's exports during periods, has been subject to the effect of the volatile world's trading market and the effect of an emerging giant exporter such as China. However, Vietnam's exports are facing some problems on international trade market for various reasons. Firstly, the export structure continues to be mainly based on primary and labor-intensive products such as the agricultural, forestry, fishery and footwear sectors. Secondly, low value added and labor intensive products account for a large proportion of the total exports since almost all economic sectors of Vietnam are involved in the assembly and simple processing stage of the global value chain. We hope this dissertation can help to constitute a reliable basis for formulating export trade policy. Firstly, there is a need for greater efforts from Vietnamese government to implement social economic structural reform with a special focus on SOEs, in order to strengthen investors' confidence. Secondly, there is also a need to encourage the shift away from labor-intensive export <b>products</b> toward <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>products</b> with special emphasis on innovation in particular through research and development activities of firms. The dissertation studies export trade of a single country namely Vietnam. It is an empirical study, which tests both macro and micro determinants of Vietnamese export trade. Particularly, the dissertation uses export trade data at country and firm level to test hypotheses for each determinant including firm and sector effects. We have extracted a dataset on Vietnam's export trade for the 1997 - 2009 period via WITS of the World Bank. For firm's gravity model, we used export data of firms from VCO for the 2006 - 2010 period. We analyzed determinants of firms' exports by combining firms' export data and the data of footwear, rice and wood and wood products firms' characteristics for the year 2008. Since firms' export intensity strictly lies in the unit interval, we transformed it into the type of logit then attempted with the OLS and quantile regression methods. Our dissertation mainly focuses on certain external factors of Vietnamese exports at macro and micro levels and analyzes some important determinants of exporting firms in three sectors namely footwear, rice and wood and wood products. Relevant findings based on empirical analysis serve to suggest policy implications and firms' managerial practices. In general, wealthier nations are preferred destination market for Vietnamese exports because of their higher purchasing power. The government of Vietnam therefore tries to negotiate proactively and conclude trade agreement as well as memorandum of understanding with such countries as these measures facilitate trade for local firms. However, rice firms in particular do not necessarily consider country with the large economy to be their destination market. In fact, there are several reasons for firms to enter international market and to sign contracts such as to improve their net profits, to expand their market share or to develop potential market. Regarding determinants of Vietnamese exporting firms, higher wages reduce a firms' propensity to export in general which significantly affects wood and wood products and footwear firms. Although, in some cases, increasing wages somewhat improve worker's productivity thus increasing export revenue, in other cases for economic reasons, higher wages can not be afforded by employers for manual workers in manufacturing sectors where skilled labor is not essential. Investing in high-tech production technology does not necessarily increase growth in the value of Vietnamese firms' exports in three sectors mentioned. Although, state-owned firms have been granted preferential or priority treatment by the Government, they appears to be less efficient than others. The regression result shows that state-owned firms in all three sectors are lagging in export performance. Ongoing Government support for state-owned, firms may lead to an unfair competitive environment especially for small, privately owned firms since the Government protection of the Government seem to be unreasonable. If full data on firms' exports of in all sectors had been obtained, the author of the dissertation were able to draw conclusions on the determinants for all sectors and compare their effects on exports accordingly. We consider innovation indicators would be interesting particularly for firms located in a developing and emerging country such as Vietnam. Therefore, we need an appropriate survey method to collect information to resolve the missing data problem of the existing database.
