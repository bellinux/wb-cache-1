The proposed scheme considers {{the information from}} both the active power measurements and the reactive power measure-ments. Under the scenario that the network operator can take multiple different samples of measurements and the attackers can attack only once, the proposed scheme can detect the pres-ence {{of what has been}} described as stealth (or unobservable) attacks. The detection is provably correct. Furthermore, if an attack is present, the proposed scheme can identify exactly the attacked transmission lines...|$|E
40|$|New and {{existing}} methods of <b>cyber-attack</b> <b>detection</b> {{are constantly being}} developed and improved {{because there is a}} great number of attacks and the demand to protect from them. In prac-tice, current methods of attack detection operates like antivirus programs, i. e. known attacks signatures are created and attacks are detected by using them. These methods have a drawback – they cannot detect new attacks. As a solution, anomaly detection methods are used. They allow to detect deviations from normal network behaviour that may show a new type of attack. This article introduces a new method that allows to detect network flow anomalies by using local outlier factor algorithm. Accom-plished research allowed to identify groups of features which showed the best results of anomaly flow detection according the highest values of precision, recall and F-measure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Cyber-attack {{detection}} is used {{to identify}} cyber-at-tacks while they are acting on a computer and network system to compromise the security (e. g., availability, integrity, and confidentiality) of the system. This paper presents a <b>cyber-attack</b> <b>detection</b> technique through anomaly-detection, and discusses the robustness of the modeling technique employed. In this technique, a Markov-chain model represents a profile of computer-event transitions in a normal/usual operating condition of a computer and network system (a norm profile). The Markov-chain model of the norm profile is generated from historic data of the system’s normal activities. The observed activities of the system are analyzed to infer {{the probability that the}} Markov-chain model of the norm profile supports the observed activities. The lower probability the observed activities receive from the Markov-chain model of the norm profile, the more likely the observed activitie...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecently cyber-attacks become serious threats {{even for}} control systems. For process control, not only {{security}} but also safety must be assured. For safety assurance, {{the effects of}} cyber-attacks such as concealed remote operation and maneuvering must be evaluated. We proposed a securing method to divide field networks into plural zones. Even when a zone is intruded and attacks are concealed, the effects appear in other zones. In this paper, an automatic <b>cyber-attacks</b> <b>detection</b> system using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is proposed. There are many kinds of relationships among variables included plural zones. Cyber-attacks change some of them. PCA is effective to detect the changes...|$|R

When sensing, computing, and networks become ubiquitous, ‘when everything is embedded with intelligence and connected to everything else via the internet and other networks, the threats and vulnerabilities will become even greater than they are nowadays’ ([92], p. 218). There {{is a need for}} technological safeguards {{as a response to the}} risks posed by the emerging urban trends of big data analytics and context-aware computing. Clear guidelines, recommendations, and requirements must be identified and put in place in relation to big data and context-aware applications for smart sustainable cities. Among the privacy mechanisms proposed thus far for addressing the issue of privacy include ‘anonymity, pseudonymity, unlinkability, and unobservability’, yet they need to be ‘fully developed, evaluated, and instantiated in their operating environment to test their performance—how well they work’ [92]. Big data and context-aware applications for smart sustainable cities require the development of more robust, if not unconventional, privacy-protecting safeguards by considering the most likely ways through which the information from different urban domains can be leaked and breached. As regards to the security, the scientific challenges ‘include methods supporting the evaluation of risk exposure…, security design principles to enable control of the risk exposure, methods for…security analysis, security of big (and context) data…, secure cloud of physical and smart things, cyber physical systems security, lightweight security solutions, authentication and access control…, identification and biometrics…, <b>cyber-attacks</b> <b>detection</b> and prevention, and so on’ ([92], p. 223 – 4). While information security risks are of diverse nature, including ‘modification, destruction, theft, or lack of availability of computer assets such as hardware, software, data, and services’ ([94], p. 442), integrity and confidentiality—i.e. protection of information from modification and unauthorized use—should be more of focus as categories of security threats in the ICT of the new wave of computing networks than in the traditional networks [92]. This is due to the fact that there are ‘possible conflict of interests between communicating entities; network convergence; large number of ad-hoc communications; small size and autonomous mode of operation of devices; and resource constraints of mobile devices’ ([95], p. 50). Of critical importance, nevertheless, is to develop a new security paradigm which supports advanced features of context-aware technology, as conventional password entry schemes using traditional input devices have proven to be vulnerable to attacks. To address these issues, new research endeavors are focusing on such new techniques as authenticating with minds; pointing and selection using gaze and keyboard; and gaze-based user authentication [92]. In relation to this, Wright et al. [95] suggest some research directions, including ‘improving access control methods by multimodal fusion, context-aware authentication and unobtrusive biometric modalities’, and ‘increasing security by detection of unusual patterns.’ [...]...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cyber-attack</b> {{classification}} and <b>detection</b> {{process is}} {{based on the fact that}} intrusive activities are different from normal system activities. Its detection is a very complex process in network security. In current network security scenario various types of cyber-attack family exist, some are known family and some are unknown one. The detection of known attack is not very difficult it generally uses either signature base approach or rule based approach, but to find out the unknown one is a challenging task. Intrusion detection is a process for this. One of the major developments in machine learning in the past decade is the ensemble method, which finds highly accurate classifier by combining many moderately accurate component classifiers. This paper addresses using of an ensemble classification methods for intrusion detection. The paper proposes a cascaded support vector machine classifier or an improved ensemble classifier using multiple kernel function. The multiple kernel is Gaussian in nature. The graph based /neural network technique used for feature collection of different types of cyber-attack data. The proposed algorithm is very efficient in comparison of pervious method...|$|R
40|$|Attacks in {{cyberspace}} have got attention due to risk at privacy, {{breach of trust}} and financial losses for individuals as well as organizations. In recent years, these attacks have become more complex to analyze technically, {{as well as to}} detect and prevent from accessing confidential data. Although there are many methodologies and mechanisms which have been suggested for <b>cyber-attack</b> <b>detection</b> and prevention, but not from the perspective of an attacker. This paper presents the cyber-defence as hindrances, faced by the attacker, by understanding attack thread and defence possibilities with existing security mechanisms. Seven phases of Cyber Attack Thread are introduced and technical aspects are discussed with reference to APT attacks.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{a central}} challenge {{arising from the}} success of modeling human behavior in making decisions from experience: our ability to scale these models up to explain non-cooperative team behavior in a dynamic cyber space. Computational models of human behavior based on the Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT) have been highly successful in representing and predicting individual’s behavior of decisions from experience. Recently, these IBL models have been also applied to represent a security analyst’s experience and cognitive characteristics {{that would result in}} accurate predictions of threat identification and <b>cyber-attack</b> <b>detection.</b> The IBL models derive predictions on the accuracy and timing of threat detection in a computer network (i. e., cyber situation awareness or cyberSA). This chapter summarizes the current state of models at the individual level, and it describes the challenges and potentials for extending them to address predictions in 2 -player (i. e., defender and attacker) non-cooperative dynamic cybersecurity situations. The advancements that would potentially contribute to a more secure cyberspace are discussed...|$|E
40|$|As {{computer}} and network technologies evolve, {{the complexity of}} cybersecurity has dramatically increased. Advanced cyber threats have led to current approaches to <b>cyber-attack</b> <b>detection</b> becoming ineffective. Many currently used computer systems and applications have never been deeply tested from a cybersecurity {{point of view and}} are an easy target for cyber criminals. The paradigm of security by design is still more of a wish than a reality, especially in the context of constantly evolving systems. On the other hand, protection technologies have also improved. Recently, Big Data technologies have given network administrators a wide spectrum of tools to combat cyber threats. In this paper, we present an innovative system for network traffic analysis and anomalies detection to utilise these tools. The systems architecture is based on a Big Data processing framework, data mining, and innovative machine learning techniques. So far, the proposed system implements pattern extraction strategies that leverage batch processing methods. As a use case we consider the problem of botnet detection by means of data in the form of NetFlows. Results are promising and show that the proposed system can be a useful tool to improve cybersecurity...|$|E
40|$|Research in cyber-security has {{demonstrated}} that dealing with cyber-attacks {{is by no means}} an easy task. One particular limitation of existing research comes from the uncertainty of information gathered and used to discover attacks. Part of this uncertainty is related to lack of attack prediction models that take advantage of contextual information to analyze activities that target computer networks. A major challenge of the existing attack detection approaches is the identification of relevant information to a particular situation, and the use of such information to perform multi-evidence intrusion detection. Addressing such limitations require combining several aspects of context to better predict, avoid and respond to attacks so that several consistent evidence contribute to the decisions about the relevancy of attacks that target the network. A promising path along this direction is to elevate contextual information as a first class object in collecting and analyzing cyber security data. Yet again, the quality and adequacy of contextual information is important to decrease uncertainty in correctly identifying potential cyber-attacks. This dissertation introduces a novel framework that extracts and uses contextual information to discover cyber-attacks. A systematic methodology has been used to identify contextual dimensions that need to be considered to consequently improve the effectiveness of <b>cyber-attack</b> <b>detection</b> process. A methodology which combines graph, probability, and information theories along with domain knowledge is utilized to create several context-based attack prediction models that analyze data at a high- and low-level. This context-based framework identifies not only known, but also unknown attacks which an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is not aware-of. The outlined framework can be mainly applied in conjunction with existing intrusion detection techniques to improve attack detection rate. In addition to showing the theoretical properties of the generated prediction models, several types of experiments have been conducted to evaluate the prediction models of known and unknown attacks. A comparison with other methodologies shows that a multi-layer fusion of contextual information in the process of attack discovery leads to superior results in terms of better attack detection and fewer false positive rates...|$|E
