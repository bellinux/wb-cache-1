5|$|In 1966, Barker got his {{break with}} the satirical sketch series The Frost Report, having been {{recommended}} for the show by producer James Gilbert. The show starred David Frost, John Cleese and Barker's future comedy partner Ronnie <b>Corbett,</b> whom he had met in 1963 when <b>Corbett</b> was the barman at the Buckstone Club near the Haymarket Theatre, and the two became friends. <b>Corbett</b> stated in his autobiography that the two had gravitated towards each other because of their similar backgrounds; neither had attended university, {{while many of the}} other Frost Report cast and writers had. Each episode of the show, which was performed and broadcast live, was focused on a single topic and principally revolved around a continuous monologue from Frost, with sketches from Barker, <b>Corbett</b> and Cleese as the show went on. Barker starred alongside Cleese and <b>Corbett</b> in The Frost Reports best known sketch, which satirised the British class system, with Barker representing the middle class.|$|E
