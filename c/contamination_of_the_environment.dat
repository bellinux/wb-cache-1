5|$|Neptunium-237 is {{the most}} mobile {{actinide}} in the deep geological repository environment. This makes it and its predecessors such as americium-241 candidates of interest for destruction by nuclear transmutation. Due to its long half-life, neptunium will become the major contributor of the total radiotoxicity in 10,000 years. As {{it is unclear what}} happens to the containment in that long time span, an extraction of the neptunium would minimize the <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> if the nuclear waste could be mobilized after several thousand years.|$|E
25|$|Cinnabar {{and mercury}} mining {{has been part}} of the {{southern}} Sierra Gorda since the Pre classic period. This mining remained important until the 1970s, when most of the commercial mines closing and the last, in Maconí, closed in 2000. However, there are still at least six families known to mine the element on a very small scale. According to researchers, the long history of mercury mining here has caused the <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> as it built up over time. They believe this is behind the high levels of certain chronic diseases in the region.|$|E
25|$|A {{dog that}} {{successfully}} recovers from CPV2 generally remains contagious {{for up to}} three weeks, but it is possible they may remain contagious for up to six. Ongoing infection risk is primarily from fecal <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> due to the virus's ability to survive many months in the environment. Neighbours and family members with dogs should be notified of infected animals so that they can ensure that their dogs are vaccinated or tested for immunity. The vaccine will take up to 2 weeks to reach effective levels of immunity; the contagious individual should remain in quarantine until other animals are protected.|$|E

30|$|In recent years, {{surfactants}} in foam-based fire-fighting agents, used {{to extinguish}} flammable liquids or gases, shifted from long-chain PFASs (mainly C 8 -based) to short-chain PFASs (mainly C 6 -based). The stability and surface-active properties of PFASs enable a film formation {{on top of}} burning liquids, extinguishing the fire and preventing burn back. Nowadays, a number of foam-based fire-fighting agents contain short-chain PFASs. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> fire-fighting agents results in direct <b>contaminations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> {{when there is no}} possibility <b>of</b> collecting <b>the</b> fire water and subsequent disposal [33, 34].|$|R

25|$|Those {{opposed to}} amalgam use suggest that modern {{composites}} are improving in strength. In {{addition to their}} claims of possible health and ethical issues, opponents of dental amalgam fillings claim amalgam fillings contribute to mercury <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that health care facilities, including dental offices, account {{for as much as}} 5% of total waste water mercury emissions. The WHO also points out that amalgam separators, installed in the waste water lines of many dental offices, dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system. However, critics say that the separators are not mandatory in some states of the United States. The critics also point to cremation of dental fillings as an additional source of air pollution, contributing about 1% of total global emissions.|$|E

40|$|Extremophiles are {{microorganisms}} {{that have}} adapted to severe conditions that were once considered devoid <b>of</b> life. <b>The</b> extreme settings in which these organisms flourish on earth resemble many extraterrestrial environments. Identification and classification of extremophiles in situ (without the requirement for excessive handling and processing) can {{provide a basis for}} designing remotely operated instruments for extraterrestrial life exploration. An important consideration when designing such experiments is to prevent <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments.</b> We are developing a reference spectral database of autofluorescence from microbial extremophiles using long-UV excitation (405 nm). Aromatic compounds are essential components of living systems, and biological molecules such as aromatic amino acids, nucleotides, porphyrins and vitamins can also exhibit fluorescence under long-UV excitation conditions. Autofluorescence spectra were obtained from a confocal microscope that additionally allowed observations of microbial geometry and motility. It was observed that all extremophiles studied displayed an autofluorescence peak at around 470 nm, followed by a long decay that was species specific. The autofluorescence database can potentially be used as a reference to identify and classify past or present microbial life in our solar system...|$|R
