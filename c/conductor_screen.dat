40|$|Novel {{arrangements}} of active frequency selective surfaces (AFSSs) with integrated voltage control wiring are proposed for bi-state (transparency/reflectance) operation at specified frequencies. The AFSSs are comprised of passive arrays of intertwined patterns of slots in a <b>conductor</b> <b>screen</b> and an active dipole array with pin diodes placed {{either on the}} same or opposite sides of a thin dielectric substrate. Simulation and measurement results show that such AFSSs exhibit good isolation (~ 15 dB) between the translucency and reflection states at normal incidence that slightly decreases at oblique incidence. The proposed AFSSs maintain the high angular and polarisation stability over broad fractional bandwidths (FBWs) inherent to the constituent periodic arrays of intertwined conductor patterns with substantially subwavelength unit cells. The merits of these AFSS arrangements also include resilience to parasitic effects of real switches, whose insertion loss in the on-state only enhances the AFSS on/off isolation. Such AFSSs are essential elements for reconfiguring and controlling the electromagnetic architecture of buildings...|$|E
40|$|Microscopic {{pyramidal}} pits in {{a reflective}} surface, a geometry {{similar to a}} retroreflector, are frequently used to enhance signal strength. The enhancement effect is generally attributed to surface plasmons, however, the sub-wavelength to near-wavelength dimensions of the pyramidal 3 D geometry suggest contributions from diffraction and near-field effects. Our theoretical analysis of the light intensity distribution in the similar (but simpler) 2 D geometry assuming a perfect <b>conductor</b> <b>screen,</b> that is, {{in the absence of}} any plasmon effects, shows that interference patterns forming within the cavity cause a significant resonant increase in local intensity. Such effect can be important for many applications, especially for the widely used Raman spectroscopy. Resonant enhancement without plasmons of the emitted Raman signal due to enhanced local field amplitude is also possible, which implies that the geometry practically implements a Raman laser.

The gas phase reaction was described at the MP 2, QCISD(T) and CCSD(T) levels of theory. To evaluate {{the effect of the}} solvent? different continuum solvation models were used. First, as a necessary calibration, the performance of the polarizable continuum model (PCM), the <b>conductor</b> like <b>screening</b> model (CPCM) and the <b>conductor</b> like <b>screening</b> model for real solvents (COSMO-RS) was tested in the calculation of the free energies of hydration for a set of 16 neutral organic molecules.

The solvent effect on both the activation and reaction energies of the {{reaction of the}} methyl radical with hydrogen peroxide was subsequently calculated. All solvation models confirm the experimentally observed decrease in reaction rate in going from gas phase to aqueous solution. The PCM and CPCM suggest an increase in activation energy by about 4 kcal mol(- 1), corresponding thus to a 1000 -fold decrease in reaction rate, in good agreement with experiment.

40|$|Second-generation {{high-temperature}} superconductors (2 G HTS) {{have high}} current density in very high magnetic fields. They are good candidates for high field magnets, {{especially when the}} magnetic field exceeds the critical fields of low-temperature superconductors. However, the thin and flat geometry of these <b>conductors</b> allows persistent <b>screening</b> currents (or shielding currents) to flow in the <b>conductors.</b> The <b>screening</b> currents caused by the ramping of applied current to the coil is identified as the self-field screening effect.

A 2 G HTS magnet was constructed and tested, and a finite element model was built based on the magnet. The comparison between calculation and measurement is presented with detailed analysis.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from American Physical Society via the DOI in this record. The authors present a {{computationally}} efficient technique for the analysis of extraordinary transmission through both infinite and truncated periodic arrays of slots in perfect <b>conductor</b> <b>screens</b> of negligible thickness. An integral equation is obtained for the tangential electric field in the slots both in the infinite case and in the truncated case. The unknown functions are expressed as linear combinations of known basis functions, and the unknown weight coefficients are determined by means of Galerkin's method. The coefficients of Galerkin's matrix are obtained in the spatial domain in terms of double finite integrals containing the Green's functions (which, in the infinite case, is efficiently computed by means of Ewald's method) times cross-correlations between both the basis functions and their divergences. The computation in the spatial domain is an efficient alternative to the direct computation in the spectral domain since this latter approach involves the determination of either slowly convergent double infinite summations (infinite case) or slowly convergent double infinite integrals (truncated case). The results obtained are validated by means of commercial software, and it is found that the integral equation technique presented in this paper is at least two orders of magnitude faster than commercial software for a similar accuracy. It is also shown that the phenomena related to periodicity such as extraordinary transmission and Wood's anomaly start to appear in the truncated case for arrays with more than 100 (10 Ã— 10) slots.

40|$|The micrometeoroid and {{orbital debris}} (MM/OD) {{environment}} {{poses a threat}} to satellites and manned spacecraft. This threat lies in the risk of individual components being affected by an impact of a particle from the MM/OD population. Among spacecraft components, harnesses are especially exposed to that risk due to their ubiquity inside a spacecraft and their importance for fundamental spacecraft functions such as supplying power and relaying digital and analog communications. The degradation or breakdown of such a mission-critical component can shorten the lifetime of a satellite or, in the worst case, lead to loss of a mission. Past impact tests have shown that mechanical damage to cables like cratering and removal of insulation can result in permanent functional degradation after impact. However, during the impact event, transient processes develop which until now have not yet been characterized. These processes include voltage spikes that propagate along a cable poten tially damaging connected equipment such as on-board computers, sensors and other electronics. A hypervelocity impact test campaign was performed on space-grade unshielded single <b>conductor,</b> <b>screened</b> twisted pair and radio-frequency coaxial lines in a representative experimental setup.
