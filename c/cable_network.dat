50|$|Over-the-air (OTA) {{commercial}} {{stations and}} networks generate {{the vast majority}} of their revenue from advertisements. According to a 2001 survey, broadcast stations allocated 16 to 21 minutes of programming time per hour to commercials. Most <b>cable</b> <b>networks</b> also generate income from advertisements, although most basic <b>cable</b> <b>networks</b> also receive subscription fees, which are the other main source of revenue for the cable operators. However, premium <b>cable</b> <b>networks</b> (such as HBO) do not air commercials; instead, cable television subscribers must pay an extra fee to receive this type of pay television service.|$|R

For example, even though NBC's Olympic Games and NHL coverage is available in Canada via U.S. affiliates, broadcasts of these programs on <b>cable</b> <b>networks</b> such as CNBC or MSNBC are normally blacked out and replaced with alternate programming, in deference to the respective rights of CBC or Rogers Media.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a new fault location technique for distribution networks, which uses distributed parameter line model in its power frequency based algorithm.

5000|$|Cable {{television}} {{programming is}} often divided between basic and pay television (or premium programming). Basic <b>cable</b> <b>networks</b> are generally transmitted without any encryption or other scrambling methods and thus anyone {{connected to the}} cable television system can receive the basic channel.

Most (though not all) basic <b>cable</b> <b>networks</b> also include advertising to supplement the fees, since their programming costs are not usually covered by per-subscriber fees alone.|$|R

50|$|In most <b>cable</b> <b>networks,</b> the UHF band is {{unusable}} {{because its}} frequency is too high, so TV stations are only allocated within Band I, III, the Mid-, Super- and Hyperband.
