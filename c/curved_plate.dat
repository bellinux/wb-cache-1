Around the central feature, which projects slightly from the frontage, is an acanthus leaf border worked in precast concrete. A white stucco frieze of interlocking discs frames the panel. There is 18,000 feet of floor space in the building arranged around an air-well. The ground floor was designed for retail. The central entrance and show windows had <b>curved</b> <b>plate</b> glass that had to be specifically made in England. Italian tiles were used in the floors throughout the building. The upper four floors, of which one complete floor was reserved for the Oriental Government Security Life Assurance Company, was used as office space and was reached by a lift and staircase {{at the side of the}} building. The basement was constructed separately, with windows fitted with sliding steel doors. The contract time for completing the structure was eight months, and the construction was to start shortly after late November 1931, with the architects reported as Messrs. Booty and Edwards, the contractors as Gammon (Malaya) Ltd., and Steen Sehested as the consulting reinforced concrete specialist.|$|E
500|$|In 1926 the N15 class {{became the}} first in Britain {{equipped}} with smoke deflectors, with several designs tested. Experiments were undertaken throughout 1926 and included the fitting of a <b>curved</b> <b>plate</b> above the smokebox of No.E753 Melisande to channel air from below the chimney to lift the exhaust above the locomotive when on the move. Nos.E450 Sir Kay and E753 Sir Gillemere had air scoops attached to the chimney, whilst E772 Sir Percivale was fitted with large, square German-type smoke deflectors. Finally, No.E453 King Arthur was fitted with small, rectangular smoke deflectors fitted to the handrails on the smokebox sides. The experiments produced mixed results, and Maunsell requested {{the assistance of the}} University of London in staging wind tunnel tests [...] These resulted in a standard plate design (illustrated in the infobox), which was gradually fitted to the class from late 1927 onwards.|$|E

Trials were conducted in which plates were pre-stressed by the imposition of a large bending moment from two parallel sides resulting in a tensile stress on the outer surface facing the blast. Tests were conducted at approximately one third linear scale using target plates of 500 mm x 500 mm and a charge of between 100 g and 250 g buried in dried sand was used to load them.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} review of failure of stiffened <b>curved</b> <b>plates</b> and shells is presented. Panel instability in stiffened <b>curved</b> <b>plates</b> and general instability of stiffened cylinders are discussed. The loadings considered for the plates are axial, shear, and {{the combination of the}} two. For the cylinders, bending, external pressure, torsion, transverse shear, and combinations of these loads are considered. When possible, test data and theory were correlated. General instability in stiffened cylinders was investigated. For bending and torsion loads, test data and theory were correlated. For external pressure several existing theories were compared. As a result of this investigation a unified theoretical approach to analysis of general instability in stiffened cylinders was developed. (author) ...|$|R
60|$|The one full-grown {{specimen}} of S. rostratum, in Mr. Cuming's collection, {{was in a}} good state of preservation, but dry. The three parasites were attached, as stated, close under the labrum, {{between it and the}} adductor muscle. They are constructed like ordinary Cirripedia, and have a mouth, thorax and cirri, enclosed in a capitulum, supported on a peduncle of moderate length and narrow. The entire length of the capitulum and peduncle, as far as could be ascertained in the shrivelled condition of the specimens, was 35/1000ths, and the greatest width of the capitulum 11/1000ths of an inch. Both capitulum and peduncle are hirsute with spines, nearly 1/1000th of an inch in length, mingled with shorter hairs in little rows of three and four together. The figure (5) in Pl. VI is merely a restoration, as accurate as could be made from the much shrivelled specimens. There are only three valves,--namely, an oval carina (a), seated rather high up on the capitulum, in a rudimentary condition and only 1/1000th of an inch in length, and a pair of scuta; these latter consist of a narrow, slightly <b>curved</b> <b>plate,</b> 8/1000ths in length, broadest at the lower end, where the breadth is 2/1000ths of an inch. The prehensile antennæ, {{at the end of the}} peduncle, have pointed hoof-like discs: I was not able to make out the other parts. It deserves notice, that in the young {{specimen of}} the ordinary form of S. rostratum, 1/10th of an inch in length, and therefore only thrice as long as the parasites, all the valves were perfect, and seemed to have followed the ordinary law of development.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Weld joints form an {{important}} part of pressure vessels, they are highly essential for structural integrity of the system. Typical welds are done on flat surfaces and their strengths are well catalogued for reference. If a lap joint is required for longitudinal plates, the reference for taking overlap length is available. When a lap joint is required for <b>curved</b> <b>plates,</b> no reference is available for it. The objective of the project is to form certain set of guidelines or set of formulations which will serve as a guideline for overlap length in lap joint of <b>curve</b> <b>plates.</b> Analysis type for this will be Structural Non Linear Finite Element Analysis i. e. by using ANSYS 12. 0 Workbench for modeling and ANSYS 12. 0 for Structural Non Linear Analysis.

40|$|Available {{theories}} and test data on buckling of <b>curved</b> <b>plates</b> and shells are reviewed. For torsion and external-pressure loadings, the test data are correlated {{in terms of}} linear buckling theories for both the elastic and inelastic ranges. The cases which exhibit a marked disagreement between linear theory and test data include those of <b>curved</b> <b>plates</b> and cylinders under axial compression, cylinders under bending, and spherical plates under external pressure. These cases have been analyzed by a unified semiempirical approach for both the elastic and inelastic ranges which is satisfactory for analysis and design purposes. The effects of internal pressure on buckling of elements under uniaxial loads are discussed and data on various combined loadings are presented in interaction form. (author) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCold bending {{of glass}} {{involves}} the straining of relatively thin glass components, (typically plates), at ambient temperatures, {{and is a}} low energy and cost effective manner of creating curvilinear forms required in modern glass applications. Cold bending is also popular because it is thought to eliminate the optical imperfections in <b>curved</b> glass <b>plates</b> that arise during alternative and more conventional thermal bending techniques. Experimental and numerical investigations on the cold bending of monolithic glass plates into anticlastic shapes are undertaken and described in this paper. The aim is to characterise the cold bending behaviour during the bending process and to evaluate the surface/optical quality of the <b>curved</b> <b>plates.</b> Two distinct phenomena of interest are observed: (i) {{a change in the}} deformation mode that under particular boundary and loading conditions lead to snap-through buckling and; (ii) a local instability termed “cold bending distortion” that appears on <b>curved</b> <b>plates</b> when certain applied displacement limits are exceeded. This cold bending distortion is found to occur at stresses significantly below the fracture strength of the glass plate, but the distortions can be sufficiently large to breach optical serviceability requirements. An optical quality evaluation procedure for predicting the cold bending response and the resulting optical quality of monolithic glass plates are provided {{at the end of this}} paper...|$|R

40|$|The {{basic concept}} of Hybrid Active-Passive Constrained Layer Damping (HAPCLD) {{treatment}} was proposed by introducing active {{control to the}} concept of passive constrained layer damping configuration in the 1990 s to compensate for weak points in active and passive controls by using their respective merits for more robust and stable control. Since then, combinations of various configurations and applicable control strategies have been proposed and studied in many engineering areas. However, there is still a need for a new modelling method to more easily establish models of HAPCLD treatment and its validation through control analysis and experiment with various structures from beams to <b>curved</b> <b>plates.</b> In this thesis, velocity feedback control strategy was applied to cantilever beams with four different configurations of HAPCLD treatment to check their applicability. Moreover, the application was expanded to flat and <b>curved</b> <b>plates.</b> Control results with each configuration for flat and <b>curved</b> <b>plates</b> were analysed by using self-established MATLAB codes based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) with the basic concept of a layer-wise approach for coupling each layer of structures and deriving Equivalent Single Layer (ESL) models. This new numerical modelling method was established by introducing coupling matrices based on a layer-wise approach to combine individual FE mass and stiffness matrices of each layer into one ESL model for a whole structure. Furthermore, these numerical models were supported by experiments in a lab. All measured data was compared with simulation results and they were confirmed in good agreement in general. In addition to this, the relation between mode shapes and control by piezoelectric patches occupying a broader area than an ideal actuator was studied to find the conditions for more stable control of flat and <b>curved</b> <b>plates.</b> In conclusion, as discussed for active control with beams, AC/PSOLD treatment, which consists of a piezoelectric actuator directly attached to a base structure and a stand-off layer with a viscoelastic core and elastic constraining patch laminated on the piezoelectric actuator, was clarified to give the most efficient and robust active control results for plates regardless of the curvature of all HAPCLD treatments dealt within this thesis as well. AC/PSOLD treatment could give similar reductions with smaller control gain in simulation. And, larger reductions were obtained with measured transfer functions in experiments than other configurations...|$|R
