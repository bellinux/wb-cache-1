40|$|We embed {{proprietary}} trading into {{a model of}} bank lending. Opportunities to engage in purely speculative trading can harm the real economy. This is because banks, when devoting cheap but scarce deposits to lending rather than to gambling, must be compensated for giving up gambling rents. This makes corporate loans more costly, stifling real economic activity. Worse, gambling can <b>crowd</b> out <b>lending,</b> forcing firms to seek costly bond financing. By contrast, when trading {{is required for the}} provision of complementary banking services, banks may actually engage in too little trading. Ring-fencing trading can facilitate the efficient provision of banking services...|$|R

We characterize the recent trends regarding LICs domestic public debt and explore the relevance of different arguments put forward on the benefits and costs of government borrowing in local public debt markets. The main stylized fact emerging from the data is the increase in domestic government debt since 1996. We also observe that poor countries {{have been able to}} increase the share of long-term instruments over time and that the maturity lengthening went together with a decrease in borrowing costs. However, the concentration of the investor base, mainly dominated by commercial banks and the Central Bank, may <b>crowd</b> out <b>lending</b> to the private sector...|$|R
40|$|The {{welfare gains}} from {{adopting}} a zero nominal interest policy {{depend on the}} implementation details. Here I argue that implementing the Friedman rule by a government loan program may be better than implementing it by collecting taxes, even when lump sum taxes are possible. The government loan program will <b>crowd</b> out <b>lending</b> and borrowing and other money substitutes. Since money can be costlessly created the resources spent on creating money substitutes are a "social waste". Moving from an economy with strictly positive nominal interest rate to an economy with zero nominal interest rate will increase consumption {{by the amount of}} resources spent on lending and borrowing. But in general welfare will increase by more than that because consumption smoothing is better under zero nominal interest rate.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{speculation}} using credit derivatives on the cost of debt and the likelihood of default. The availability of credit default swaps induces investors who are optimistic about bor-rower revenues to sell protection instead of buying bonds. This ben-efits borrowers if protection can only be bought with an insurable interest, but can increase the cost of debt and <b>crowd</b> out produc-tive <b>lending</b> if protection can be purchased as a bet on default. We also show that the possibility of speculation on default may cause multiple equilibria and exacerbate the problem of rollover risk. JEL: D 53, D 84, G 1...|$|R
40|$|I {{examine the}} {{implementation}} of the Friedman rule under the assumption that age dependent lump sum transfers are possible and private intermediation is costly. This is done both in an infinitely lived agents model and in an overlapping generations model. I argue that in addition to a zero nominal-interest-rate policy (the so called Friedman rule) a transfer to young agents, or a government loan program is required for satiating agents with real balances. The paper also contributes to the understanding of Friedman’s original article and discusses related questions {{about the size of the}} financial sector. It is shown that the adoption of the (modified) Friedman rule will <b>crowd</b> out private <b>lending</b> and borrowing. I also look at the social value of a market for contingent claims and argue that resources spent on operating a market for accidental nominal bequests are a waste from the social point of view in spite of the fact that individuals have an incentive to trade in such markets...|$|R
40|$|In this research, I {{investigated}} {{the determinants of}} demand for credit and consumption of credits among small farmers of district Mandi Bahauddin, Pakistan. For this purpose, I interviewed 123 households of six villages of this district. Both qualitative and quantitative techniques were employed to examine factors that affect demand for credits. Seven hypotheses were devised and tested and probit and OLS models were {{used to analyze the}} effects of education, household size and income on demand for credit. For sake of clear understanding, income variable was further decomposed into three types of income i. e. livestock income, agricultural production income and other sources of income. I found that informal borrowing (from friends and relatives), higher interest rate and high transaction costs <b>crowded</b> out formal <b>lending.</b> However, consumption smoothing was not a major reason for demand for formal loans. A positive correlation was found between education and demand for credit. Household size and all types of incomes did not significantly correlate with demand for credit. Moreover, being residents of villages Lakhnewala and Badshahpur showed higher probability of demand for credit than being resident of Kangsahali, whereas being residents of Shahidanwali, Wara Alam Shah and Chak Abdullah did not affect demand for credit.

40|$|We {{examine the}} view, espoused {{by a number}} of {{commentators}} in recent months, that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should seek to withdraw from its long-term lending operations, {{in the wake of the}} recent financial crisis in Asia and elsewhere, and restrict itself to its 'core competency' of preventing and where necessary lending into financial crisis. This view is based on a belief that such long-term <b>lending</b> <b>crowds</b> out both private sector operations and short-term IMF lending; and that it is ineffective, because of weaknesses in the IMF's conditionality. Both of these propositions, we argue, can be challenged. In the poorer developing countries there is virtually no private sector to crowd out, and Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) operations have been conspicuously successful, not only at promoting growth, but also at achieving structural changes not at all achieved by aid donors such as strengthening the tax base. Such changes inevitably require a longer time-period than the standard three years of an IMF standby, not only in order to induce a production response but also in order to achieve the necessary measure of stabilisation and economic reform without imposing social pressures which wreck the production response. The latter argument is particularly powerful in middle income countries, and provides an argument for IMF support to these countries also whilst they are temporarily excluded from international capital markets. Often also a long-term presence is needed to achieve effective leverage in short-term operations. In such cases the IMF's long-term lending should be seen as preconditional to the success of, and not as an alternative to, its short-term operations. We therefore argue for the retention of the Fund's long-term lending function; and for this function not to be transferred to the World Bank, which has less credibility in global financial markets and less comparative advantage in macro-economic management. Measures are indeed needed to reduce the level of the IMF's exposure to risk in poorer developing countries, but those, we believe, should consist of the preventive measures currently going on, and measures to increase the ratio of equity to debt, rather than measures which would jeopardise the progress in long-term poverty alleviation capacity achieved by the Fund over recent years Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2001. ...|$|R
