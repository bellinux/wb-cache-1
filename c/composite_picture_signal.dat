40|$|We {{discuss the}} problem of people {{retrieval}} by means of <b>composite</b> <b>pictures</b> constructed according to descriptive portrait. An overview of the problem state-of-the-art is provided beginning from the basic concepts and terminology to a modern technology for <b>composite</b> <b>picture</b> creation, real-world scenarios and search results. The development history of systems for forming composite portraits (photo robots and sketches) and the ideas implemented in these systems are provided. The problem of automatic comparison of <b>composite</b> <b>pictures</b> with the original ones is discussed, {{and the reasons for}} unattainability of stable retrieval of originals by a <b>composite</b> <b>picture</b> in real-world scenarios are revealed. Requirements to <b>composite</b> <b>pictures</b> databases in addition to the existing benchmark databases of facial images and also methods for implementation of such databases are formulated. Approaches for generation of sketches population from an initial one that increase effectiveness of identikit-based photo image retrieval systems are proposed. The method of similarity index increasing in the couple identikit-photograph based on computation of an average identikit from the created population is provided. It is shown that such <b>composite</b> <b>pictures</b> are more similar to original portraits and their use in the discussed search problem can lead to good results. Thus the created identikits meet the requirements of the truthful scenario as take into account the possibility of incomplete information in descriptions. Results of experiments on CUHK Face Sketch and CUHK Face Sketch FERET databases and also open access identikits and corresponding photos are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Reading {{is one of}} {{language}} skills that should be learnt by students because every activity in class involves reading. In fact, students generally feel bored and unmotivated in learning English especially in reading skill because English is different from Indonesian so that the students have difficulty in understanding reading English text. They {{do not know the}} meaning of some words in the text. Therefore, the teacher’s role becomes important in the teaching and learning process especially in teaching reading. Therefore, appropriate media should be chosen to motivate their students not only to read the text but also comprehend what they read. One of the media that can be used and applied by the teacher is <b>Composite</b> <b>Pictures.</b> A <b>Composite</b> <b>Picture</b> is a large single picture which shows a scene in which a number of people can be seen doing several things. Thus, to know {{whether or not there was}} a significant effect of using <b>Composite</b> <b>Pictures</b> on reading comprehension achievement; <b>Composite</b> <b>Pictures</b> was used as media in teaching reading in this research...|$|R

40|$|Publisher東京論文The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to explore the relation between accuracy and confidence on <b>composite</b> <b>picture</b> recognition. Forty eight participants intentionally learned a set of 48 facial photos. After the learning phase, participants in the immediate group immediately gave the old-new judgments as well as the confidence rating about each judgment, while participants in the delayed group did so one day later. The faces used in the test phase included old faces, new faces, and conjunction faces. Conjunction faces as <b>composite</b> <b>pictures</b> were made from facial parts of the different faces which were presented during the learning phase. In the immediate group, there was not a correlation between accuracy and confidence rating on recognition of conjunction faces （γ =. 11 ）. In the delayed group, there was a negative correlation between accuracy and confidence rating on recognition of conjunction face（γ =-. 21 ）. Though confidence rating is often used as a predictor of eyewitness memory accuracy, the result suggested that the confidence is not a good predictor of accuracy on <b>composite</b> <b>picture</b> recognition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Spin-wave {{excitation}} mode {{from the}} spin-polarized ground {{state in the}} fractional quantum Hall liquid with odd fractions (ν = 1 / 3, 1 / 5) numerically obtained by the exact diagonalization of finite systems is shown to be accurately described, for wavelengths exceeding the magnetic length, {{in terms of the}} composite-fermion mean-field approximation for the spinwave (magnon) theory formulated in the spherical geometry. This indicates that the <b>composite</b> <b>picture</b> extends to excited states, and also provides the spin stiffness in terms of peculiar exchange interactions. PACS numbers: 73. 40. Hm. Although it is more than a decade since the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect[1] was discovered and identified as a novel prototype of strongly correlated electron system, a new {{way of looking at the}} problem is now being explored in terms of the composite-fermion picture. There is a mounting evidence that the <b>composite</b> <b>picture,</b> which was first proposed by Jain[2] as an alternative to the Haldane-Halperin hierarchy [3, 4], is surprisingly adequate. The <b>composite</b> <b>picture</b> asserts that a quantum Hall liquid of electrons in the external magnetic field B, which corresponds to ν− 1 = 2 m+ 1 flux quanta per electron (m: an integer), is equivalent, in a meanfield sense, to a liquid of composite fermions each carrying 2 m flux quanta in the effectiv...|$|R

40|$|The optimal {{analysis}}/synthesis filters {{giving the}} maximum coding gain are derived in subband schemes.

Approximated emphasis characteristic determined from a spectrum model of <b>picture</b> <b>signals</b> can be used and the ideal hand-splitting filters can be replaced by conventional subband filters since the degradation of coding gain due to these approximations is small. Computer simulation of super HD image coding by the proposed scheme is performed.

The proposed scheme is very suited to super HD image coding since the improvement of SN ratio is large for images with high correlation between the neighboring pixels. 1...|$|R

They are real generalisations, because they include the whole of the material under consideration. The blur of their outlines, which is never great in truly generic composites, except in unimportant details, measures the tendency of individuals to deviate from the central type. My argument is, that the generic images that arise before the mind's eye, and the general impressions which are faint and faulty editions of them, are the analogues of these <b>composite</b> <b>pictures</b> which we have the advantage of examining at leisure, and whose peculiarities and character we can investigate, and from which we may draw conclusions that shall throw much light on the nature of certain mental processes which are too mobile and evanescent to be directly dealt with.|$|R
