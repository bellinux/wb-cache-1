We quantified the response of tree net primary productivity (NPP), live biomass (BIO), and mean carbon residence time (CRT =[*]BIO / NPP) to spatial variation in water availability in the western US. We used forest inventory measurements from 1953 mature stands (>  100  years) in Washington, Oregon, and California (WAORCA) along with satellite and climate data sets covering the western US. We summarized forest structure and function in both domains along a 400  cm yr − 1 hydrologic gradient, quantified with a climate moisture index (CMI) based on the difference between precipitation and reference evapotranspiration summed over the water year (October–September) and then averaged annually from 1985 to 2014 (CMI wy). Median NPP, BIO, and CRT computed at 10  cm yr − 1 intervals along the CMI wy gradient increased monotonically with increasing CMI wy across both WAORCA (r <b>s</b> [*]=[*] <b>0.</b> <b>93</b> – <b>0.</b> 96, p  <  0. 001) and the western US (r <b>s</b> [*]=[*] <b>0.</b> <b>93</b> – <b>0.</b> 99, p  <  0. 001). Field measurements from WAORCA showed that median NPP increased from 2. 2 to 5. 6  Mg C ha − 1  yr − 1 between the driest and wettest 5  % of sites, while BIO increased from 26 to 281  Mg C ha − 1 and CRT increased from 11 to 49  years. The satellite data sets revealed similar changes over the western US, though these data sets tended to plateau in the wettest areas, suggesting that additional efforts are needed to better quantify NPP and BIO from satellites in high-productivity, high-biomass forests. Our results illustrate that long-term average water availability is a key environmental constraint on tree productivity, carbon storage, and carbon residence time in mature forests across the western US, underscoring the need to assess potential ecosystem response to projected warming and drying over the coming century...|$|R

According to the obtained results, the calculated values of KC significantly differed from values released by FAO paper No 56 for the crops. The Ks values clearly differ from one stage to another because the salt accumulation in the root zone causes to reduction of total soil water potential (Ψt), therefore, the average values of water stress coefficient (Ks) follows this order; FW(1. <b>0)</b> = <b>S</b> 1 (1. <b>0)</b> > <b>S</b> 2 (1. <b>0)</b> > <b>S</b> 3 (<b>0.</b> <b>93)</b> > <b>S</b> 4 (<b>0.</b> 82).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{reports the}} {{development}} of the OsteoArthritis Questionnaire (OA-Quest) - a new measure designed to comprehensively capture the potentially modifiable burden of osteoarthritis. DESIGN: Item development was guided by the a priori conceptual framework of the Personal Burden of Osteoarthritis (PBO) which captures 8 dimensions of osteoarthritis burden (Physical distress, Fatigue, Physical limitations, Psychosocial distress, Physical de-conditioning, Financial hardship, Sleep disturbances, Lost productivity). One hundred and twenty three candidate items were pretested in a clinical sample of 18 osteoarthritis patients. The measurement properties of the OA-Quest were assessed with exploratory factor analysis (EFA), Rasch modelling, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in a community-based sample (n =  792). RESULTS: EFA replicated 7 of the 8 PBO domains. An exception was PBO Fatigue domain, with items merging into the Physical distress subscale in the OA-Quest. Following item analysis, a 42 -item 7 -subscale questionnaire was constructed, measuring Physical distress (seven items, Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> α =  <b>0.</b> <b>93),</b> Physical limitations (11 items, α =  0. 95), Psychosocial distress (seven items, α =  <b>0.</b> <b>93),</b> Physical de-conditioning (four items, α =  0. 87), Financial hardship (four items, α =  <b>0.</b> <b>93),</b> Sleep disturbances (five items, α =  0. 96), and Lost productivity (four items α =  0. 90). A highly restricted 7 -factor CFA model had excellent fit with the data (χ(2) (113)  =  316. 36, P <  0. 001; chi-square/degrees of freedom =  2. 8; comparative fit index [CFI] =  0. 97; root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] =  0. 07), supporting construct validity of the new measure.

The two factors explained 50. 04 % of the variance (LV = 20. 24 % and FR = 29. 80 %). Inter-item correlations were all significant and the item-total correlations suggested the weakness of one item in the LV scale. <b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> alpha was <b>0.</b> 72 (LV) and 0. 79 (FR). Confirmatory factor analysis however provided marginal support for the posited structure. Vigorous types were significantly more alert than languid types across the day and suggested they are less influenced by sleep inertia on waking. Vigorous types also reported needing significantly less sleep. Significant differences in alertness between flexible and rigid types were found between 16 : 00 and 22 : 00 and suggested flexible types are less influenced by circadian and wakefulness factors during these periods. Flexible types also reported significantly less sleep need compared to rigid types. The findings suggested vigorous and flexible types would best cope with shiftwork.

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of albite from Stintino, Sardinia, Italy, was refined at {{different degrees of}} disorder to determine the (Si-Al) order-disorder process. Eight X-ray structure refinements were performed on single-crystal data collected at room temperature, after heating at 1050 – 1090 °C for 3 to 12 days. Average long-range order coefficients <b>S</b> between <b>0.</b> <b>93</b> and <b>0.</b> 24 were obtained for different samples. The results indicate that in the (Si-Al) disordering process Al enriches the T 1 m site more than T 2 o and T 2 m sites. This trend continues until both T 1 o and T 1 m are occupied by 30 % of Al, and T 2 o and T 2 m by 20 % of Al. No evidence of complete disorder in T 1 and T 2 sites has been experimentally found to date. The (Si-Al) disordering process induces a clockwise rotation of the four-membered rings of tetrahedra parallel to the (100) plane. An inverse linear relationship between the isotropic equivalent displacement parameter of the Na atom, Beq(Na), and S is interpreted as positional disorder of Na. The variations in the Na-O bond lengths with increasing disorder are explained by the related variations in the bond strengths of tetrahedral cations...|$|R

We have determined the number of cells in apoptosis, and the mediators regulating the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in specimens of varicose vein. METHODS: Venous segments were obtained from 46 patients undergoing surgical treatment for primary varicose veins. Controls samples were obtained from 20 patients undergoing distal arterial bypass grafting surgery. Segments of the distal and proximal saphenous trunk as well as tributaries were studied. Cell apoptoses and mediators of the mitochondrial and trans membrane pathway were evaluated with peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection, Bax and Fas detection, caspase- 9 and 8 detection in the medial layer. RESULTS: Disorganised histological architecture was observed in varicose veins. Primary varicose veins also contained fewer peroxidase in situ-positive cells than control veins (2. 6 % <b>S.</b> D. <b>0.</b> 2 % versus 12 % <b>S.</b> D. <b>0.</b> <b>93</b> %, P=. 0001, Mann-Whitney u test), fewer Bax positive cells (2. 1. % <b>S.</b> D. <b>0.</b> 3 % versus 13 % <b>S.</b> D. <b>0.</b> 9 %, P=. 0001) and fewer Caspase 9 positive cells (3. 2 % S. D. 1 % versus 12 % S. D. 1. 3 %, P=. 0001). Similar findings were observed in saphenous trunk, main tributaries and accessory veins. In patients with recurrent varicose veins in whom the saphenous trunk had been preserved showed similar findings to primary varicose veins. Residual varicose veins contained fewer peroxidase in situ-positive cells than healthy veins (3. 2 % <b>S.</b> D. <b>0.</b> 6 % versus 11 % S. D. 2 %, P=. 0001), fewer Bax positive cells (2. 2 % <b>S.</b> D. <b>0.</b> 3 % versus 12 % <b>S.</b> D. <b>0.</b> 7 %, P=. 0001) and fewer Caspase 9 positive cells (2. 6 % <b>S.</b> D. <b>0.</b> 6 % versus 12 % S. D. 1 %, P=. 0001). Immunohistochemical detection for Fas and caspase 8 remained equal was the same in the varicose vein and control groups. CONCLUSION: Apoptosis is down regulated in the medial layer of varicose veins. This dysregulation is attributable to a disorder of the intrinsic pathway and involves the great saphenous vein trunk, major tributaries and accessory veins.

By using single-photon excitation of the 6 S 1 / 2 - 7 S 1 / 2 caesium transition in a quasi-static electric field, we have detected an electronic polarization of the excited state, specific to an interference effect occurring in mixed electric magnetic dipole transitions. Our measurements, independent of the vapour density, indicate that the magnetic dipole amplitude M 1 has {{the same size as}} the electric dipole amplitude E 1, induced by an electric field, parallel to the light wave polarization, and equal to 2. 62 ± 0. 21 V/cm.

40|$|The {{anomalous}} Hall effects (AHE) {{were investigated}} at various temperatures for the pseudo-single-crystal Fe 4 N films, deposited on MgO substrates with changing {{the degree of}} order (S) of the nitrogen site. Both the anomalous Hall resistivity and the longitudinal resistivity simply decrease with lowering temperature for all the specimens. The AHE of the Fe 4 N films is presumed to arise from an intrinsic mechanism because {{of the relationship between}} the anomalous Hall resistivity and longitudinal resistivity. The anomalous Hall conductivity, σAH, exhibits a specific behavior at low temperature. In the case of the film with <b>S</b> = <b>0.</b> <b>93,</b> the σAH drastically drops below 50 K, while it simply increases with lowering temperature in the range of 50 – 300 K. This low-temperature anomaly decays with decreasing S of the film and nearly vanishes in the films with low S. The threshold temperature and the dependence on S of the low-temperature anomaly of the σAH well correspond to those of the anisotropic magnetoresistance effects in the Fe 4 N films, reported in the literatures. From these results, it is suggested that the low-temperature anomaly of the σAH originates from the crystal field effect which reflects the structural transformation from a cubic to a tetragonal symmetry below 50 K and provides a modulation of the orbital angular momentum of the 3 d orbitals at the Fermi level...|$|R

The suspended particles were most affected by proximity of point source and sewage overflows, which were associated with significant increases in the concentration of faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci and Clostridium perfringens spores. In contrast, only faecal coliform counts significantly increased in sediments with increasing distance from the point source. Sewage overflow again resulted in increased concentrations of faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci and Clostridium perfringens spores in suspended particulate matter. Faecal coliforms were identified as the most useful indicator of faecal pollution as only this indicator correlated significantly to the organic matter contents (r = <b>0.</b> 88, r <b>s</b> = <b>0.</b> <b>93)</b> for sediment samples. The amount of organic matter in suspended particulate matter was not significantly different but a gradual increase in the organic matter with an average value of 2 to 3 % was detected in the sediment samples with increasing distance from the point source.

The retrieval of CH and GSV with ALS yielded high accuracies with R 2 <b>s</b> of <b>0.</b> <b>93</b> and <b>0.</b> 81, respectively. A second set of randomForest models was developed using multi-temporal ALOS PALSAR intensities and repeat-pass coherences in two polarizations as well as Landsat data as predictor and stand-level ALS based estimates of CH and GSV as response variables. At three test sites, the retrieval of CH and GSV with PALSAR/Landsat reached promising accuracies with R 2 s {{in the range of}} 0. 7 to 0. 85. We show that the combined use of multi-temporal PALSAR intensity, coherence and Landsat yields higher retrieval accuracies than the retrieval with any of the datasets alone. Potential limitations for the large-area application of the fusion approach included (1) the low sensitivity of ALS first/last return data to forest horizontal structure, affecting the retrieval of GSV in less managed types of forest, and (2) the dense ALS sampling required to achieve high retrieval accuracies at larger scale...|$|R

A potential resistance mechanism is activation of EGFR and/or downstream pathways by stimuli in the microenvironment. The {{aim of this study}} was to find molecular targets induced by the microenvironment by determining the in vitro and in vivo expression of proteins of the EGFR-signaling network in 6 HNSCC lines. As hypoxia is an important microenvironmental parameter associated with poor outcome in solid tumors after radiotherapy, we investigated the relationship with hypoxia in vitro and in vivo. Methods Six human HNSCC cell lines were both cultured as cell lines (in vitro) and grown as xenograft tumors (in vivo). Expression levels were determined via western blot analysis and localization of markers was assessed via immunofluorescent staining. To determine the effect of hypoxia and pAKT-inhibition on cell survival, cells were incubated at 0. 5 % O 2 and treated with MK- 2206. Results We observed strong in vitro - in vivo correlations for EGFR, pEGFR and HER 2 (r <b>s</b> = <b>0.</b> 77, p= <b>0.</b> 10, r <b>s</b> = <b>0.</b> 89, p= 0. 03) and r <b>s</b> = <b>0.</b> <b>93,</b> p= <b>0.</b> 02, respectively), but not for pAKT, pERK 1 / 2 or pSTAT 3 (all r <b>s</b> <b>0.</b> 30). In vivo, pAKT expression was present in hypoxic cells and pAKT and hypoxia were significantly correlated (r <b>s</b> = <b>0.</b> 51, p= 0. 04). We confirmed in vitro that hypoxia induces activation of AKT. Further, pAKT-inhibition via MK- 2206 caused a significant decrease in survival in hypoxic cells (p Conclusions These data suggest that (p) EGFR and HER 2 expression is mostly determined by intrinsic features of the tumor cell, while the activation of downstream kinases is highly influenced by the tumor microenvironment. We show that hypoxia induces activation of AKT both in vitro and in vivo, and that hypoxic cells can be specifically targeted by pAKT-inhibition. Targeting pAKT is thus a potential way to overcome therapy resistance induced by hypoxia and improve patient outcome. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{cavitating}} high-pressure water-jet {{provided the}} means by which a range of materials (plastics, clay and concrete) were eroded. The measured erosion resistance was a proxy for an initially unknown combination of other properties: strength, fracture toughness, impact resistance, hardness, surface roughness, and limiting service temperature. To ascertain the cause of damage to sewers during high-pressure water-jetting, information about which material properties contributed to the measured erosion resistance under a standard high-pressure water-jetting test were found. The experimental work, and published literature, provided a database of physico-mechanical, physico-chemical, thermal and tribological material properties each of which in turn were correlated with the measured jetting resistance. The properties best correlated with the jetting resistance were: maximum service temperature (R 2  =  <b>0</b> <b>ṡ</b> <b>93),</b> elastic modulus (R 2  =  <b>0</b> <b>ṡ</b> 90), surface roughness (R 2  =  <b>0</b> <b>ṡ</b> 89), density (R 2  =  <b>0</b> <b>ṡ</b> 87), and thermal conductivity (R 2  =  <b>0</b> <b>ṡ</b> 87). The correlation coefficient between jetting resistance and impact resistance (R 2  =  <b>0</b> <b>ṡ</b> 56) lay just outside the top 10, suggesting that this was not an impact problem but a more complex combination of strength, roughness, and heat dissipation despite actual failures ultimately resulting from fracture (for which toughness was nevertheless also poorly correlated (R 2  =  − <b>0</b> <b>ṡ</b> 38)). Traditional mechanical wear, abrasion, and erosion resistance parameters (Taber abrasion (R 2  =  − <b>0</b> <b>ṡ</b> 24), limiting pressure-velocity (R 2  =  − <b>0</b> <b>ṡ</b> 57), and wear index (R 2  =  − <b>0</b> <b>ṡ</b> 23)) failed to correlate with the jetting resistance...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Perfusion imaging is {{increasingly}} used for postoperative evaluation of extracranial to intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery. Altered hemodynamics and delayed {{arrival of the}} contrast agent in the area fed by the bypass can influence perfusion measurement. We compared perfusion asymmetry obtained with different algorithms in EC-IC bypass surgery patients. Methods: We retrospectively identified all patients evaluated with computed tomography perfusion (CTP) between May 2007 and May 2011 after EC-IC bypass surgery at our institution. CTP images were analyzed with three perfusion algorithms that differ among their ability to anticipate for delayed arrival time of contrast material: the delay-sensitive first-moment mean transit time (fMTT), the semi-delay-sensitive standard singular value decomposition (sSVD) and the delay-insensitive block-circulant SVD (bSVD). The interhemispheric difference in bolus arrival time (Delta BAT) was determined to confirm altered hemodynamics. Interhemispheric asymmetry in perfusion values (mean transit time (MU) difference, cerebral blood flow (CBF) ratio and cerebral blood volume (CBV) ratio) was compared between the three algorithms. Presence of a new infarct in the treated hemisphere was evaluated on follow-up imaging and perfusion asymmetry was compared between patients with and without infarction. Results: Twenty-two patients were included. The median interhemispheric difference in Delta BAT was <b>0.</b> 98 <b>s.</b> The median MTT difference was significantly smaller when calculated with the delay-insensitive algorithm than with the other algorithms (<b>0.</b> 44 <b>s</b> versus <b>0.</b> 90 <b>s</b> and <b>0.</b> <b>93</b> <b>s,</b> p Conclusion: In patients with EC-IC bypass surgery, delay-sensitive algorithms showed larger MTT asymmetry than delay-insensitive algorithms. Furthermore, only the delay-insensitive method seems to differentiate between patients with and without infarction on follow-up. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Objectives : To determine {{the prevalence of}} HCV infection amongst screened individuals, between September 2007 and September 2009 to determine the relationships between serum antibody levels {{and the presence of}} viral RNA. Methods : Serological results of the research to anti HCV antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-ELISA (BioMérieux ®) of 4536 subjects were analyzed retrospectively. The results of molecular research (Cobas AMPLICOR HCV Roche Diagnostics ®) of 79 patients were extracted from medical records, and genotypes 1 and 3 were the most frequent. The probability of serologic results to be related to molecular analysis was verified by ROC curve constructed for different values of Index (OD sample / OD cutoff ELISA). Results : Of samples for which the molecular test was performed, 82. 3 % confirmed the presence of HCV RNA. Positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) for the presence of viremia, considering Index values of 4. 0 3. 0 and 2. 0 were: for the Index 4. <b>0</b> sensitivity (<b>S)</b> of 62 %, specificity (Sp) 64 %, PPV 89 %, NPV of 27 %.

Using X-ray diffraction, it is shown that CdCl 2 induces the greatest extent of recrystallization (standard deviation of texture coefficients, <b>s,</b> reduces from <b>0.</b> <b>93</b> for as-grown CdTe to 0. 43) and minimizing stress (from 178 MPa for as-grown material to zero). MgCl 2 treatment also yields significant randomization of the CdTe texture (<b>s</b> = <b>0.</b> 55) but NaCl treatment does not (s = 1. 10). A strong correlation between the extent of metallurgical changes induced by the chloride treatment (and consequently, device efficiency) and the dissociation energy of the cationCl bond is shown, thereby accounting for the ineffectiveness of NaCl (bond energy = 4. 3 eV). From this, a mechanism for Cl activation is postulated. By X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy it is also shown that the Te/Cd ratio at the back surface, and the Cl content at the CdTe–CdS interface, are both higher following CdCl 2 - and MgCl 2 treatments (Te/Cd = 1. 3 – 1. 4, and 1 – 2 at% Cl) than following NaCl treatment (Te/Cd = 1. 1, and 0 at% Cl) ...|$|R

METHODS: The SSE {{was completed}} by 40 adult with epilepsy attending an Outpatient Epilepsy Clinic at the University Hospital of UNICAMP, and by 40 people from the community. People were interviewed on an individual basis; a psychologist read the questions to the subjects who wrote the answers in a sheet. The procedure was {{the same for all}} the subjects and completion took around ten minutes. RESULTS: The SSE has 24 items. The internal consistency of the SSE showed alpha <b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> coefficient <b>0.</b> 88 for the patients with epilepsy and 0. 81 for the community. The overall mean scores of the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy formula were: 46 (SD= 18. 22) for patients and 49 (SD= 13. 25) for the community where a score of 0 would suggest no stigma, and 100 maximum stigma. DISCUSSION: The SSE has satisfactory content validity and high internal consistency. It allows the quantification of the perception of stigma by patients and people from community; this can then be used for interventional studies, such as mass media campaign in minimizing the negative facets of stigma.

40|$|Background/Purpose. Black {{women have}} lower injury {{prevalence}} after sexual assault and childbirth {{as compared to}} White women. Investigators have also published findings describing similar differences in wound healing and in pressure ulcer formation. Sommers et al. (2008) suggested that differences in injury prevalence may not be related to race or ethnicity, but rather to skin color, and that {{the properties of the}} skin may vary based on skin color. To explicate biomechanical differences that might influence the effects of skin injury versus protection, we chose to investigate the physiological constructs of viscoelasticity and skin color. The study aim was to account for the variability in skin viscoelasticity at four anatomical locations (volar forearm, upper inner arm, inner thigh, and sacrum) as a function of race/ethnicity, skin color, age, body mass index (BMI), recent weight loss, smoking status, sun exposure, and health status in women. ^ Methods. We enrolled 233 healthy adult female participants at a large urban university in this prospective study with a descriptive, cross-sectional design. Study staff collected data regarding health status and demographics via survey. We calculated BMI after obtaining height and weight measurements on-site and measured skin color with a handheld spectrophotometer and skin elasticity with the Cutometer MPA 580. We also developed and used the Sun Exposure Survey Instrument (SESI), which we first evaluated for content validity (S-CVI 0. 944) and internal consistency (<b>Cronbach.</b> <b>s</b> alpha <b>0.</b> 869, 17 items, N= 63) to measure sun exposure. ^ Results. Significant differences were found in viscoelasticity values across anatomic sites for all participants. The most significant predictor variables of skin viscoelasticity were age, recent weight loss, and BMI. R 2 results ranged from 0. 24 - 0. 41. The significance of the relationships between skin color, sun exposure, and race with viscoelasticity varied across sites. ^ Conclusions and Future Work. The association between aging and decreased skin elasticity is well known, but confirmed herein. The findings on BMI and weight loss are novel and require further investigation. While we explained little of the variance in skin elasticity through the skin color and sun exposure variables, we contend that these relationships should be reassessed with a greater number of participants and a more diverse sample. ...|$|R

HTHP binds to the positively charged surface but no direct electron transfer (DET) is found due to the long distance of the active sites from the electrode surfaces. At carboxyl-terminated surfaces, the neutrally charged bottom of HTHP can bind to the SAM.

40|$|An initial {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the variability of selected metabolites in the plasma from guanacos. A second experiment directly compared plasma biochemical values for guanacos with those for sheep. During the first experiment, jugular blood samples were collected from five mature castrated guanacos using an embedded experimental design. Weekly blood samples were collected {{at the same time}} (09. 00 h) on the same day each week for 7 weeks. Daily blood samples were collected at the same time each day (09. 00 h) during week 5. On day 2 of week 5, blood samples were collected every 3 h from 09. 00 h for a 24 -h period. No evidence of a cyclical pattern of plasma parameters was observed on a weekly, daily or 3 -h basis. During the second experiment, the metabolic profiles of 11 mature castrated guanacos and 11 mature barren ewes (Merino ? Welsh Mountain) were compared. Significant differences in plasma concentrations of all metabolites except urea-nitrogen (guanacos - 15 ? 42 mmolll, sheep - 15 ? 60 (s. e. d. 1 ? 506) mmolll) were found with values for guanacos v. sheep as follows: glucose (7 ? 63 v. 3 ? 63 (<b>s.</b> e. d. <b>0</b> ? 268) mmolll); acetate (0 ? 26 v. <b>0</b> ? 48 (<b>s.</b> e. d. <b>0</b> ? 035) mmol/l); ? hydroxybutyrate (0 ? 06 v. <b>0</b> ? 50 (<b>s.</b> e. d. <b>0</b> ? 019) mmol/l); albumin (33 ? 4 v. 29 ? 5 (<b>s.</b> e. d. <b>0</b> ? <b>93)</b> g/l); and total protein (53 ? 8 v. 65 ? 6 (s. e. d. 2 ? 12) g/l); (P < 0 ? 001 for all previous variables); non-esterified fatty acids (0 ? 48 v. <b>0</b> ? 29 (<b>s.</b> e. d. <b>0</b> ? 048) meq per 1; P < 0 ? 01) and a-amino N (2 ? 44 v. 2 ? 66 (<b>s.</b> e. d. <b>0</b> ? 088) mmolll; P < 0 ? 05).
