This {{research}} studies and answers the problem concerning with regulating of holding debit-credit <b>cooperation</b> <b>activity</b> in laws. And also to know potential criminal acts {{which can be}} happened in holding debit-credit <b>cooperation</b> <b>activity.</b> This research {{is a kind of}} normative research which is descriptive. The kind of data which is used is secondary data that consist of primary law material, secondary law material and tertiary law material. Data collecting technique used is document study with content analysis technique. Based on the research and the analyze, it showed that holding the <b>activity</b> of debit-credit <b>cooperation</b> refers to regulation no. 525 1992 about cooperation; Government regulation no. 9 1995 about carrying out of debit credit <b>activity</b> business by <b>cooperation,</b> and the decision of minister of cooperation, little and middle entrepreneur minister of Republic Indonesia no: 351 /KEP/M/XII 1998 about guidance of implementation debit credit activitybusiness by cooperation. From the three regulations which regulate of holding debit credit <b>cooperation</b> <b>activity</b> can be known that debit credit <b>cooperation</b> <b>activity</b> is to unite and to make flow the fund which directed only to the members of cooperation, candidate of member, cooperation and/or its member. Actually at recent time, a lot of debit credit cooperation which unite fund from a broad society beyond members of cooperation. The weak control and even no control against debit-credit cooperation give chance for deviations against regulation regarding with debit credit cooperation. The deviation is not merely deviation against ethic code of cooperation, but also it directed to criminal acts which make the caretaker and manager of cooperation to be suspected. And criminal acts which have potency to be happened in debit-credit <b>cooperation</b> <b>activity</b> are among others: first, criminal act as it is regulated in criminal law, that is criminal act of embezzlement and swindle; second, criminal act which direct to bank crime; third, criminal act which also direct to criminal cooperation.

Our empirical analysis of 18 German regional innovation networks shows that public research organizations, especially universities, are profoundly involved in knowledge exchange processes and possess more central (broker) positions within their regional innovation networks than private firms. This results, in part, from public re-search's gatekeeper function which can be particularly important in lagging regions that typically suffer {{from a lack of}} large firms which often fill this role in advanced regions.

40|$|The {{study is}} focused on the {{cooperation}} of Russian companies with research organizations in implementing R&D projects during technological innovation. Taking into account behavioral changes, authors carry out a micro-level analysis based on empirical data of executive survey of over 600 Russian industrial firms (2011 — 2012) and about 350 research organizations and universities (2012). The authors emphasize the key factors of firms’ demand for outsourcing R&D reveal the main barriers to the development of university-industry cooperation and their particularities for different cooperation actors. The analysis shows that there is a positive relation between the size of a company and R&D outsourcing. As for the factor of age, the highest <b>cooperation</b> <b>activity</b> of Russian firms is observed among enterprises founded over 20 years ago. As far as concernes <b>cooperation</b> <b>activity</b> of research organizations, large ones are significantly more likely to cooperate with business. A common prerequisite for research organizations' R&D cooperation with business is sufficient academic ranking. Business and science evaluate differently various obstacles to effective cooperation. For firms, the main problems are the inflated costs of national R&Ds, insufficient research organizations’ orientation at company needs, and low quality of developments. As for representatives of research organizations, they mention as barriers primarily the lack of companies' receptivity to innovation and inadequate information about promising developments. Businesses are more optimistic about cooperation with science if they already have a relevant experience of interaction. In the case of research organizations we observe a different pattern: most problems seem more significant to organizations conducting R&D in business interests. ...|$|R
