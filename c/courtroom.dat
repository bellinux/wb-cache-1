5|$|The Ace Attorney {{games are}} visual novel {{adventure}} {{games in which}} the player controls defense attorneys and defends their clients in several different episodes. The gameplay is split into two types of sections: investigations and <b>courtroom</b> trials. During the investigations, the player searches the environments, gathering information and evidence, and talks to characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. Once enough evidence has been collected, the game moves on to a <b>courtroom</b> trial section.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is {{cast in the}} Classical Revival architectural style and contains elements common to that style. Stained glass, columns and a pediment are among the more noticeable features at a glance. The rear facade of the {{building is}} designed to resemble a temple and also features stained glass windows. A stone porte-cochere covers the rear driveway. Inside the building's third floor <b>courtroom</b> is more stained glass, {{in the form of}} a skylight. During the early 1980s a made for television movie had scenes filmed in the DeKalb County Courthouse's <b>courtroom.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>courtroom</b> {{scene in}} which {{numerous}} sacks of letters to Santa Claus are delivered to court is a parody of the 1947 film Miracle on 34th Street.|$|E
500|$|The <b>courtrooms</b> {{vary from}} {{as large as}} [...] to as small as [...] and are in a pear-shaped design. Designs for the <b>courtrooms</b> were partly based on the <b>courtrooms</b> of the Bordeaux Law Courts in France. The jury box is {{recessed}} and does not resemble a traditional jury box. The <b>courtrooms</b> feature ribbons of wood panels on the walls in rooms that narrow as they reach the bench at the front. The wood is primarily cherry with walnut accents. Natural light is let into the <b>courtrooms</b> from small opening in the walls. Videoconferencing {{is available in the}} <b>courtrooms.</b>|$|R
50|$|When first {{completed}} in 1975, the Building housed 26 <b>courtrooms.</b> To cope with an increasing caseload, more <b>courtrooms</b> were added over the years. Today, there are 40 <b>courtrooms</b> and 28 hearing chambers. The {{services provided by}} the State Courts have also increased {{over the past four}} decades to better serve the community. The building achieved conservation status on 10 July 2013.|$|R
50|$|During the 20th century, the {{building}} underwent several significant interior alterations, {{which included the}} addition of new <b>courtrooms</b> {{and the removal of}} the train tracks. Renovations that began in 2002 involved the modernization of existing <b>courtrooms</b> and the installation of six new <b>courtrooms</b> and judge's chambers to accommodate the growing needs of the courts. Lobby spaces were restored, and {{the building}}'s exterior was cleaned and re-pointed.|$|R
5|$|After the {{plaintiff}} rests, {{the defense lawyer}} calls Marcy, Al, and Peggy to the stand. She asks Marcy a series of embarrassing questions, hoping to prove Marcy knew that the camera was there. Her tactic with the Bundys {{is to try to}} prove sexual intercourse did not occur on the videotape. In the end, the Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury does not believe that sex occurred. After everyone exits the <b>courtroom,</b> Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the <b>courtroom</b> camera.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the Supreme Court, {{business}} was conducted at a variety of locations in downtown Salem. The first public building to house the court was the Territorial Capitol Building in Salem that was built between 1854 and 1855. In that building the <b>courtroom</b> was in a chamber measuring 20 feet by 27 feet on the first floor. On December 29, 1855, after the building was partially occupied, it burned to the ground. In 1876, the state finished construction on a second capitol building where the court was located on the third floor. This <b>courtroom</b> measured 54 feet by 46 feet, while the state law library was 75 feet by 70 feet. A separate building was built by the state in 1914 to house the Supreme Court, and this is now the oldest building on the Capitol Mall after the second capitol building burned down on April 25, 1935.|$|E
5|$|Marking Specter's {{entire career}} in the Senate and, indeed, in all his public offices was one {{overriding}} fact: First and foremost, he considered himself essentially a trial attorney rather than a professional politician. During his tenures on Senate committees, his approach to their hearings was very similar to <b>courtroom</b> examinations of trial witnesses.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} was declared open on 3 August 1939 by Sir Shenton Thomas {{and handed over}} to the Chief Justice, Sir Percy McElwaine, on the same day. The courthouse had 11 <b>courtrooms</b> and adjoining judges' chambers. In 1988, a further 12 <b>courtrooms</b> from the City Hall were transferred to the Supreme Court to accommodate the needs of the main courthouse, as it needed more <b>courtrooms.</b>|$|R
50|$|When the {{paralegal}} profession was unregulated, {{judges and}} justices {{of the peace}} were under no requirement to allow them into their <b>courtrooms</b> and Kopyto has been excluded from individual <b>courtrooms</b> on over 50 occasions.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is a modern, purpose-built facility which currently contains 26 <b>courtrooms.</b> These include a dedicated Murri Court, two Coroners courts and four Small Claims hearing rooms.The building {{has the capacity to}} expand to 39 <b>courtrooms.</b>|$|R
5|$|Non-comedic roles after Airplane! {{included}} Prom Night (1980) and Creepshow (1982), both horror films, and as {{a dramatic}} and unsympathetic character in the 1986 comedy Soul Man. His last dramatic role was as Allen Green, a violent client of a prostitute killed in self-defence by Barbra Streisand's character, Claudia Draper, in Martin Ritt's <b>courtroom</b> drama Nuts (1987).|$|E
5|$|Peter goes {{on trial}} for Lois' murder. Carter falsely testifies against Peter, and Peter is close to {{receiving}} life in prison. However, Lois suddenly appears in the <b>courtroom</b> and reveals that Stewie, not Peter, tried to kill her.|$|E
5|$|The Judge {{was always}} {{headline}} news. He {{was a great}} showman, theatrical in appearance, with his sharp jaw and shock of white hair, and people always crowded into his <b>courtroom,</b> knowing there would be something going on. There were few dull moments.|$|E
50|$|The {{third floor}} {{contains}} the since covered dome, now illuminated by surrounding lights. This floor also houses the <b>courtrooms.</b> When the courthouse first opened {{there were three}} <b>courtrooms,</b> but the third has since been converted into the county law library.|$|R

5000|$|The {{courthouse}} {{remains in}} use as Crawley Magistrates Court (...) [...] It has three <b>courtrooms.</b> Refurbishment work was undertaken in 2012, {{but only the}} ground floor is accessible to disabled people {{as there is no}} lift access to the first floor, where two of the <b>courtrooms</b> are situated.|$|R
5|$|The {{illusion}} of endless rows of Klingons {{was created by}} brightly lighting the accused {{in the center of}} the room with a bright blue light, then letting the rest of the set fall into shadow. To give the set a larger appearance, a shot from high above the <b>courtroom</b> was created using miniatures. Inspired by a scene in Ben-Hur, matte supervisor Craig Barron used two hundred commercially available Worf dolls sent by Ralph Winter. Angry Klingons were created by rocking the dolls back and forth with motors, waving sticks lit by twelve-volt light bulbs dyed red. The resulting <b>courtroom</b> miniature was ten feet long.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the <b>courtroom</b> scene, the Kool-Aid Man is seen {{breaking}} through a wall, which later became a running gag in the series involving a certain character or {{breaking through}} a wall and Peter's job as a Mascot is a parody of the Cocoa Puffs commercial.|$|E
5|$|Work {{was carried}} out between 1616 and 1733, {{bringing}} the castle back into good order. As part of this, the spine wall was rebuilt properly, and the second floor windows enlarged. The <b>courtroom</b> featured a chair for the Stannary court judge, additional seating for the court officials and a railed, public section around {{the outside of the}} room. The <b>courtroom</b> also doubled as a hall for village dances and feasts. At the start of the 19th century, however, Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt, the Lord Warden of the Stannaries, began the construction of Dartmoor Prison at Princetown. Dartmoor Prison and Princetown grew increasingly important and courts began to be held there instead of Lydford Castle.|$|E
50|$|Ten <b>courtrooms</b> {{were needed}} for the federal courts. Two were created within {{the north and south}} wings of the 1911 building, while the {{addition}} provided eight more. All the <b>courtrooms</b> offer state-of-the-art technology, and are designed so that each can be used, inter-changeably, for District, Bankruptcy, or Magistrate proceedings.|$|R

5|$|According to Simon Goldhill, the {{evidence}} is fundamentally inconclusive. Goldhill writes that the theatre {{can be seen as}} a social and political event analogous with the Assembly and the <b>courtroom,</b> and women may have been excluded. David Kawalko Roselli writes that although Goldhill's perspective is valuable, he does not sufficiently consider the theatre's ritual purpose. If women did attend the theatre, they may have sat separately from the men.|$|E
5|$|During the 2012 {{legislative}} session, Roberts was award {{a handful}} of awards: 2012 Champion of Conservation Award from the Colorado Coalition of Land Trusts, the 2012 Pinnacle Award from the Colorado Farm Bureau, the 2012 Common Sense in the <b>Courtroom</b> Award from the Colorado Civil Justice League, and the 2012 Green Colorado Legislator of the Year Award. She was also honored to win the 2012 Legislator of the Year Award from the Colorado Economic Development Council.|$|E
5|$|Eshiro {{said that}} they could have set the game in a <b>courtroom</b> {{similar to that of the}} main series and made a few additions, but that it would not have been very interesting; instead they moved the game to crime scenes, and added several new {{gameplay}} elements. Yamazaki was the one who came up with the idea of making a game about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. Because of this theme, it made sense to them to include the Ace Attorney character Ema Skye in the game, as she is portrayed as wanting to be a forensic scientist. Yamazaki originally suggested that Ema should be the main character, but based on fan feedback, they decided to use the more popular character Miles Edgeworth instead. Figuring out how to move the game from the <b>courtroom</b> to the crime scene was a challenge for the development team. The team also thought that it was difficult to make the game feel new while also making sure it felt similar to the game series. Because of the new gameplay systems that all had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations took longer to develop than previous Ace Attorney games had.|$|E

5|$|Grace Sherwood's {{case was}} little known until Virginia Beach {{historian}} and author Louisa Venable Kyle wrote a children's book {{about her in}} 1973. Called The Witch of Pungo, it {{is a collection of}} seven local folk tales written as fiction, although based on historical events. Sherwood's story was adapted for Cry Witch, a <b>courtroom</b> drama at Colonial Williamsburg, the restored early capital of Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{served as}} {{a federal judge in}} the Southern District of New York from 1909 to 1924. He dealt with fields of common law, {{including}} torts, contracts, and copyright, and admiralty law. His initial unfamiliarity with some of these specialties, along with his limited <b>courtroom</b> experience, caused him anxiety at first. Most of Hand's early cases concerned bankruptcy issues, which he found tiresome, and patent law, which fascinated him.|$|E
5|$|His {{body was}} cut down {{after an hour}} by the hangman, John Foxton, who claimed Corder's {{trousers}} and stockings according to his rights. The body was taken back to the <b>courtroom</b> at Shire Hall, where it was slit open along the abdomen to expose the muscles. The crowds were allowed to file past until six o'clock, when the doors were shut. According to the Norwich and Bury Post, over 5,000 people queued to see the body.|$|E

500|$|The {{completed}} design {{resulted in}} a curving structure standing five stories tall with [...] of space. The bottom two floors are covered in glass and house offices, while the top three floors are covered in ribbons of steel and primarily house <b>courtrooms.</b> Three pavilions rise from the main structure to create these upper floors where the six <b>courtrooms</b> are located. Each {{of the top three}} floors have two courtrooms; two for the judges of federal district court, two for magistrate judges of the court, and two for the bankruptcy court, with these <b>courtrooms</b> spread out amongst the pavilions; two per pavilion and all on the third floor. Chambers for the judges are located above the <b>courtrooms</b> and include a seventh chamber for a visiting judge. On the same level as the judge's chambers are two law libraries for the court. The three floors featuring the <b>courtrooms</b> are joined {{to the rest of the}} building via the [...] tall atrium. Located on the second floor is the jury assembly room, which when not in use by the court is used as exhibit and meeting space.|$|R
