It will be based on the recognition of the importance of the oceanic environment to the cultures and societies of the Island Pacific, of connectedness as a defining characteristic of island life, and of the irreplaceable value of islands as places. One implication of this recognition is that the pursuit of sovereignty and development is inseparable from respect for ecology and sustainability. Perceptions and interpretations of the ocean as a connecting element have often been framed in terms of fluidity and mobility suggested by a metaphorical association between the ocean and blood that encompasses genealogical histories of migration and settlement. In my paper, I will try to suggest the advantage of framing such perceptions and interpretations in terms of a metaphorical association between the ocean and breath, drawing attention to the connection between the oceans and the lifesustaining terrestrial Atmosphere as well as the existence of islands as habitable places threatened by rising sea levels. I will indicate the importance accorded to breath and breathing in indigenous epistemologies, emphasizing the value of centered relationships and an acknowledgment of the presence and precedence of others within and beyond the horizon of visibility, and discuss the metaphorical significance of breath in conceptualizations of space, the negotiation of boundaries and cross-cultural (institutional) action with reference to poems by Caroline Sinavaiana-Gabbard, Robert Sullivan, Teweiariki Teaero and Teresia Teaiwa. published_or_final_versionThe Oceanic Conference on Creativity and Climate Change: Oceans, Islands & Skies, Suva, Fiji, 13 - 17 September 2010.

This paper describes the possibility of integrating these technologies {{for the development of}} a positive interacting system with disabled drivers. In this context, we suggest a new solution for a braking device that aims at helping paraplegic drivers: Integrated in a steer-by-wire handwheel, the driver has only to press on the handwheel to brake the vehicle. The device is equipped with automatic releasing of the handwheel movement when braking is no longer required. The proposed solution brings many advantages in terms of safety and ergonomics. Indeed, this device will enable the driver to brake and to accelerate while continuously keeping the hands on the handwheel. This gives the driver a significant gain in braking time. The use of an active braking feedback also provides a progressive and intuitive proportioning brake. This concept opens prospects to active braking assistance.

Similarly many of his drawings represent the floor plans of idealized dwellings, sometimes for specific people or historical figures, sometimes for imagined ones. Together they form part of an ongoing series exploring spatial ideas for domestic spaces: apartments, houses, bungalows, villas. Colour in these drawings is used to denote the functions and atmospheres of rooms, or the situations and qualities of the surrounding landscape – whether a schloss set in a meadow or a bungalow overlooking the sea. It also cues off the identity of the person who is thought to live there, in a web of imaginative factors that continually feed into the geometrical arrangement of forms and the colour decisions for each drawing. Götz sees colour as both beautiful and a key aspect of life that surrounds us, drawing comparison with another passion of his: gardens and flowers. Whilst Götz often references the creation of a garden or the making of a piece of architecture in his work, he sees his practice as opposite in process to that of architectural design, which <b>concretizes</b> <b>ideas</b> and designs as built form, connecting it rather to the Classical idea of art as active fantasy - something practiced as part of a personal strategy to escape from reality...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{research}} area of “interactive narration”, {{the production process}} constitutes a decisive bottleneck. Currently this bottleneck constricts {{the progress of the}} field, since the peculiarities of {{the research}} area demand that applications must be actually built in order to <b>concretize</b> <b>ideas</b> and to test the technologies. Purely theoretical considerations are not sufficient, given that the requirements can only be clarified during the production process. Methods and software environments have been lacking that could be em-ployed to rapidly implement and to iteratively enhance applications related to interactive narration, so that this iterative process would encompass the authoring tools, the application design ideas, and the requisite technolo-gies. Taking this need as a point of departure, the work presented here demon-strates the first generic software framework for the creation of interactive narratives with virtual characters, with a strong focus on visual authoring methods. The framework consists of a complete functional software envi-ronment that has already proven its efficacy and generality within a variety of projects. As basis of this framework, a novel hybrid visual formalism was developed. It enables various ways of combining directed graphs and of algorithmic control methods. With this combination, the development team can employ the directed graph as a main formalism that can be put to use immediately, and add other control mechanisms partially and incrementally as required during the progressing implementation of the application ideas. Using the directed graph, which is fairly easy to manage, as the basic structure, it is possible to guarantee that the additional technologies employed respond precisely to the requirements of the application and of the content. In this way, the framework described here enables computer scientists, domain experts and content creators to work together to create novel, often experimental applications. It is particularly suited to systems which rely on a set of fixed elements or of fixed templates, and where the creation effort is centered on {{the question of how to}} determine the sequence of basic ele-ments. A series of novel design ideas for narrative applications is also presented in this dissertation, together with the basic patterns for employing the authoring framework to implement them; this demonstrates its aptness for the creation task, and also concretizes certain hypotheses that I have developed on why and how interactivity can be combined with narration. Further on, this dissertation presents a model of an authoring framework that shall allow for concrete authoring of applications that rely on autonom-ous virtual characters. No alternative models currently exist on how authors could control even the details of the behaviors of autonomous virtual characters. It is assumed that an autonomous virtual character can be at most parameterized abstractly. The model presented here shows how autonomous virtual characters can be precisely authored, in spite of their autonomy. It is based on the concept of a set of “endorsed stories”, and also contains components for learning algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Most data {{analytics}} systems that require low-latency execution and efficient utilization of computing resources, increasingly adopt two computational paradigms, namely, incremental and approximate computing. Incremental computation updates the output incrementally instead of re-computing everything from scratch for successive runs {{of a job}} with input changes. Approximate computation returns an approximate output for a job instead of the exact output. Both paradigms rely on computing over a subset of data items instead of computing over the entire dataset, but they differ in their means for skipping parts of the computation. Incremental computing relies on the memoization of intermediate results of sub-computations, and reusing these memoized results across jobs for sub-computations that are unaffected by the changed input. Approximate computing relies on representative sampling of the entire dataset to compute over a subset of data items. In this thesis, we make the observation that these two computing paradigms are complementary, and can be married together! The high level idea is to: design a sampling algorithm that biases the sample selection to the memoized data items from previous runs.

40|$|In this article, we {{will first}} give a {{historic}} {{overview of the}} concept of benefit sharing and its appearance in official agreements, particularly with respect to crop genetic resources. It will become clear that, at present, benefit sharing is primarily considered as an instrument of compensation or exchange, and thus refers to commutative justice. However, we believe that such a narrow interpretation of benefit sharing disregards, and even undermines, much of its (historical) content and potency, especially where crop genetic resources are concerned. We argue that benefit sharing should not be based merely on commutative justice but rather on a broader model that is also grounded in the concept of distributive justice. This has repercussions for the application of benefit sharing, which we try to clarify by distinguishing between downstream and upstream benefit sharing. Upstream benefit sharing is not so much inspired by compensation for actions done, or the distribution downstream of benefits developed, but by the idea of shared decision-making on the research and development of resources fundamental to human welfare. Going upstream in the research process of crop genetic resources, and determining research agendas and improving crops according {{to the needs of the}} poor, benefit sharing may well be a tool to contribute to world food security and global justice.

The problems which {{are discussed in}} this study are; 1) How is the using of language sounds which are turned up dominantily, including rhyme “purwakanthi” and rhythm aspects on “Serat Centhini” especially in sexual matters? 2) What are the characteristics of morphology aspects on “Serat Centhini”, especially in sexual matters? 3) How are the diction, figures of speech on “Serat Centhini”, especially in sexual matters? 4) How are the moral structure expressings of poems which cover up senses, feelings and tones as well as intentions on “Serat Centhini”, especially in sexual matters? Literature reviews in this study cover the studies which are related to “Serat Centhini”, which are done by the former researchers and give significant study differences on sexual texts of “Serat Centhini” which is stylistically done by the writer. Indeed, there are seven theories which are used as the fundamental theory by the writer, they are; 1) Stylistics, 2) morphology, 3) diction, 4) rhyme and rhythm, 5) figure of speech, 6) moral structures of poems which cover senses, feelings, tones, and intentions, and 7) sex. The study is a qualitative study which has descriptive genre “Serat Centhini” is a Latin writing consisting of 12 volumes and published by Kamajaya through Yayasan Centhini in 1986 as source of the data. The writer uses sampling technique in giving stylistic aspects to “Serat Centhini”. Triangle data is used to keep the data validity. Furthermore, to collect the data, the writer uses literature reviews, reading and writing techniques. Data analysis process {{of the study is}} interactive that is using steps: data reduction, data presentation and conclussion. Data analysis techniques of the study are using; 1) two-two oposition technique, 2) substitution technique and 3) deletion technique. The result of the stylistic study on sexual texts of “Serat Centhini” composed by Pakubuwana V are concluded below. The patterns of language sounds which are turned up deminantly are “purwakanthi guru swara” or considered identical to assonance /a, o, u, ê, e, è, i/, “purwakanthi guru sastra” or considered identical to alliteration /b, c, d, g and ng, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t and y/, and “purwakanthi lumaksita. The three “purwakanthi” are abla to make sexual texts poems on “Serat Centhini” more beautiful. In morphology structure, the word forming and the diction are intended archaic. Beside, there are enigmatic word, repetition and complexity of word. The process of word forming choice relates to “guru wilangan” and “guru lagu”. There are various of diction, such as: “dasanama”, “tembung Kawi”, Arabic, sexual terms, idiom in sex. The usage of metaphore, personification, simile, metonymy not only consist of aethetic elements, but also embellish and <b>concretize</b> <b>ideas</b> which are wished to be coveyed by the poem to his readers especially something to do with sexual matters. Sexual texts on “Serat Centhini” which are turned up dominantly are, the best tine to make love, women types, how to raise women’s passions, making love techniques, jamoo for strengtness, etc. Sexual knowledge which is taught on “Serat Centhini”, actually reminds people to realite their originality and as the result, they must live their lives meaningfully.

Since {{it is impossible to}} do justice to the depth and complexity of this 'new' approach to development in just one short chapter, I explore a few significant dimensions of the concept beginning with Amartya Sen's pioneering contributions. I also look at clarifications by Nussbaum and others who offer a list of important functionings that can be included in the capabilities set. The subsequent part builds on this by exploring the transition from a utilitarian welfare economics to a fully social capabilities based ethics for development with justice. The present chapter proceeds in the direction of <b>concretizing</b> the <b>idea</b> of 'development as freedom' by discussing the role of a network of social, economic and political institutions in creating social capabilities. This allows us to develop the argument that freedom is to be viewed dynamically as the development of appropriate social capabilities embedded in a specific network of social, economic and political institutions. The following section then presents an example of a concrete area of application [...] - namely, the problem of developing women's capabilities as an important aspect of global justice [...] - in order to illustrate the practical relevance of the capabilities approach.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} approaches Iris Marion Young 2 ̆ 7 s {{politics of}} difference {{as an essential}} condition for deliberative democracy. It identifies and examines Young 2 ̆ 7 s arguments in four areas foundational {{to the politics of}} difference namely, inclusion, political equality, reasonableness and publicity. It contends that some of the arguments sustaining these foundations are shaky. Therefore, the dissertation attempts to improve the weak aspects of Young 2 ̆ 7 s arguments in order to solidify the basis for the politics of difference and, in so doing, facilitate the development of deliberative democracy. To that end, the dissertation argues against Young 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of impartiality and proposes combining Thomas Nagel 2 ̆ 7 s approach to impartiality with Benhabib 2 ̆ 7 s argument for the need for a standard of judgement. As it stands, Young 2 ̆ 7 s argument against impartiality makes it difficult, if not impossible, to create an inclusive political community. In the discussion of political equality Young dismisses essentialist difference and replaces it with relational differentiation. Thus she keeps cultural relationships fluid so as to facilitate an argument for culturally-based rights to equal citizenship. Building on Young 2 ̆ 7 s approach, this dissertation combines Charles Beitz 2 ̆ 7 s approach to political equality with Jack Knight 2 ̆ 7 s and James Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s argument for politically relevant capacities to furnish an adequate response to the charge that the politics of difference makes an unwarranted leap between the equality of people as individuals and that of people as members of cultural groups. Further, the dissertation argues that the concept of reasonableness, as used by Young, is too vague {{for the purposes of the}} politics of difference. Reasonableness is a disposition. Instead, the politics of difference should <b>concretize</b> this <b>idea</b> by discussing reasonable people. Reasonable people understand that legitimate moral and political decisions do not necessarily reflect all reasons advanced in a deliberation. Finally, by adopting James Bohman 2 ̆ 7 s distinction between deliberation and dialogue demonstrates, the dissertation demonstrates why and how it is possible for the politics of difference to maintain unity and pluralism simultaneously.

40|$|Although {{currently}} {{software development}} often separates the design phase from the implementation, the trend towards model-driven approaches is undeniable. As models {{are the primary}} development artifact in model-driven development, one {{has to deal with}} the problems surrounding huge and therefore unmanageable models. To tackle these issues, systems are often divided into components that are modeled separately. As an alternative, views can be used, which hide certain aspects of the model or present them in a different form. In both cases, several models or at least several views co-exist, which leads to the problem of model synchronization. One of the main goals of model-driven development is the automatic generation of executable applications. Here, too, model synchronization is problematic, as several information sources may affect the same code fragment. When only parts of the system are generated, the remaining application has to be coded by hand, which complicates the reapplication of the generation process. In order to achieve a high level of automation in model-driven development, the complete application has to be modeled. In this scenario, the use of several models improves understandability and precision but again leads to model synchronization issues. In this dissertation I extend and <b>concretize</b> the <b>ideas</b> presented in [AK 00] and [AK 03]. In [AK 00] Atkinson and Kühne introduced the concept of stratified architectures. With it, software systems are described by a number of strata with decreasing levels of abstraction. Each stratum introduces a concern and thereby concretizes the system description. This strict ordering limits dependencies to adjacent strata. In [AK 03] the authors complement the concept by using annotations to describe each concern. By introducing “refinement transformations”, which implement abstractly described concerns, annotations enable stepwise refinement for model based system development and, in addition, alleviate the aforementioned model synchronization issue. In my thesis I discuss similar approaches and compare them to architecture stratification. Additionally, I present a complete implementation of the stratification concept and verify its effectiveness by applying it to a real-world project. The central element is a combined graphical and textual model transformation language, which optimally fits the needs for stepwise refinement in a model-driven environment. This language enables fine grained and highly parameterizable model transformations. They are organized in concern-oriented transformation rules and described using a detailed metamodel. The rules are presented using a notation, which employs activity diagrams for the control flow and collaboration diagrams for the model transformation. The language also integrates a template-based code generation language and can be extended further by using hand-written code. It is integrated into a CASE tool and provides the ability to trace concerns and their implementations within a stratified architecture. [AK 00] Colin Atkinson and Thomas Kühne.

I argue that using Amerindian postmodernism applied to regional literature, allows a crossing of linguistic, geographic, nationalistic and economic barriers not addressed by political attempts at integration. Art, as a mediator, has the power to shift consciousness and its political power is demonstrated repeatedly in various liberation struggles and by governmental attempts to repress and restrict how art is created and used. Art culls fact from fiction and desire from apathy,whether the authors' are deliberately part of the process or not. The Introduction and Chapter One articulate and illustre Amerindian postmodernism at its most theoretical. These chapters outline the basic tenets ofthis idea to exploring queestions of identity and resource sharing. Chapter Two investigates therole and status of women using a lens, I call the Sycorax Model, which emergees from postcolonial discourse via relationships expressed in Shakespeare's The Tempest. Examining how women use, abuse and tranform their muted and stated powers for the benefits of their communities is imperitive. Chapter Three examines the Haitian Revolution, as represented in various texts, as one moment during which black people asserted their humanity and the contradictions such a claim engendered. Chapter Four explores how various theatrical forms and festivals <b>concretize</b> the positive <b>ideas</b> of regional nation building and Amerindian postmodernism. In effect, this project aruges that a regional Caribbean nation is a good and necessary thing for Caribbean survival and a process through which the cultural arts will help us navigate. It is the region's new quest for paradise, with the understanding that paradise is a process rather than a final destination...|$|R
40|$|My {{research}} investigates {{agency of}} computation and digital fabrication {{and its influence}} on the making and materiality in architecture and design. Recent developments in the computation and digital fabrication have made these technologies increasingly accessible to architects and designers in practice and academia, taking it from a rare novelty to a ubiquitous part of design practice. This has opened up a field of design exploration and brought material-making and materiality to the centre of attention in computational design, affording designers control over production processes at unseen scales and resolutions. The discourse in this field tends to stress the positivist impact of these technologies – better integrated workflows, higher precision, uninterrupted flow from design intent to material artefacts – describing them as transparent and neutral. The practice of working with computation and digital fabrication in design differs from these idealised processes: materials can misbehave, computer code inherits a world-view and assumptions based on engineering and geometry, machines have limits and depend on specific material supply chains. My research investigates {{the extent to which}} this difference reveals the agencies of materials, computation and fabrication, and tests the extent to which this can lead to new creative opportunities. I have conducted my research through my creative practice and scoped it in a designerly, practical, artistic, and scholarly context - my work consists of a series of design experiments, design studio-led investigative projects and workshops. Developing the research coincided with establishing MMlab, a research lab predicated on hands-on experimentation, fabrication and making. The research was further developed through literature and project review, collaborations and discussions with a community of practice at conferences and the practice research symposia. My exegesis groups the research in three explorations, each consisting of a framework, a number of case studies and a reflection. The first, Design and Making explores the role of making during the design process and materializing as a way of exploring rather than <b>concretizing</b> design <b>ideas.</b> The second, Code and Matter, explores how materiality and fabrication are encoded in computational design models. The third, Allographic Machines, explores designing in negotiation with specific fabrication machines. A number of inquiries were developed through these three explorations: the negotiation between design intent and the creative significance of the unexpected as well as the expected outcomes of design processes; the negotiation between the agency of the designer and the agency evident in materiality, computation and fabrication, the allographic qualities of external agencies in design. The contribution that my research makes to new knowledge can be located within the specificity of the explorations: firstly, making explicit the agencies uncovered through the explorations; secondly, recognizing these agencies to be negotiable; and thirdly, developing design projects through negotiating these agencies. Fourthly, next to these specific contributions, a more general modus operandi has been developed for negotiating external agencies as a designer: an agile, prototypical approach to evaluating rapidly changing technologies in design.

40|$|Istaknuti trogirski fiziokrat Ivan Luka Garagnin posvetio je značajan dio svojih tekstova obrazovanju na području poljodjelstva i organizaciji poljodjelskih škola. U arhivi Garagninovih autorica je prepoznala i analizirala prostorne planove i arhitektonske projekte I. L. Garagnina, u kojima je i crtežima konkretizirao neke literarno predočene zamisli. Garagninovi prostorni planovi prikazuju organizaciju gospodarstva s radionicom za preradu grožđa i maslina, koju je držao nužnom za poljodjelsku pouku u Dalmaciji. Sam je izradio i arhitektonske projekte pripadajućih zgrada opremljene detaljnim legendama, vrijedno svjedočanstvo o prostornoj organizaciji onodobnih ruralnih građevina. Ivan Luka Garagnin (1764 – 1841), a {{prominent}} physiocrat from Trogir, dedicated {{vast majority of}} his writings to topics of education in agriculture and the organisation of agricultural schools. His was a vision of Dalmatia as a land prospering {{on the basis of}} strong and modern agriculture, and excellence in education in the spirit of physiocracy, respectively. Garagnin disseminated his physiocratic ideas which perceived nature as the key to development, and natural law as the one governing social and economic behaviour, in scientific papers, lectures given at economic societies, through his correspondence with renowned men of science, while putting them into practice on his family estates. Garagnin`s theses rely explicitly on his predecessors: from the Italian Renaissance champions of agrarian ideals Camillo Tarello de Lonato and Agostino Gallo, the English agricultural pioneer Jethro Tull and the French physicist and botanist Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceaua, to his contemporaries Arthur Young, Giovanni Fabroni and Giambatista da San Martino. Da San Martino was also a member-correspondent of Split Economic Society and Garagnin was personally acquainted with him. In 1790 s Italy, the advancement of agriculture and the establishing of agricultural schools was one of the predominant issues in public life causing heated debate. This was also the time when, in a Venetian magazine Nuovo giornale enciclopedico d’Italia, edited by Elisabetta Caminer Turra, a famous writer, journalist and translator, Garagnin published essays on the importance of agriculture and its modernisation, including the modernisation of beekeping, cattle breeding and mining. Agricultural schools present a leitmotif of Garagnin`s scientific and professional work envisaged in a booklet titled Delle scuole agrarie, published in Milan in 1798, {{as well as in the}} 7 th book of his grandiose opus Riflessioni economico-politiche sopra la Dalmazia, titled Dell’educazione e dell’istruzione pubblica from which we learn about Garagnin`s belief in the necessity of education of the lower social classes on agriculture and crafts, these two presenting the basis of economy, therefore the basis of progress, too. Equally important was Garagnin`s empirical application of his theoretical work. As a firm believer in physiocracy, he established model farms. On his family estates he cultivated plant and animal species in order to disperse them throughout Dalmatia and thus advance the underdeveloped economy. The mission of advancing Dalmatia served as a motivating force behind landscaping and building model farm buildings. His mission was to create prototypes whose purpose would not be fulfilled until they were implemented throughout Dalmatia. Work on the family estates helped him to devise and organise agricultural estates for the purpose of agricultural school, the pinnacle of his vision of unity of scientific, educational, and practical work. This vision is visible in the projects of Ivan Luka Garagnin – two spatial plans of estate where he marked the allocation of each building and three designs with elaborated layouts of some of those buildings – all kept in State Archives in Split. In these designs he developed and <b>concretize</b> the <b>ideas</b> previously set forth in words. Garagnin`s spatial plans present the organisation of an agricultural estate with grape and olive processing facilities, which he considered essential for the teaching of agriculture in Dalmatia. He personally designed architectural designs of appurtenant buildings together with detailed legends explaining the markings, a priceless testimony on spatial organisation of rural buildings of that time. The mere fact that numerous locations in Dalmatia today match the Garagnin`s plan of estate with grape and olive processing facilities proves that the realisation of an architectural idea is not of utmost importance, nor it is the establishing where the boundary between fantasy and reality used to be. We believe that the time will show that the ideas of a persevering individual going beyond the boundaries of his surroundings can be realized outside his time, in future, in a space those ideas were intended for in the first place. A close relationship between agriculture and spatial planning, founded on respect for the spirit of place, once envisaged, can be realised in present time and possibly provide a foothold for our daily activities, even in altered spatial context...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{sustainable}} {{and sustaining}} planning strategy is globally important for metropolitan areas. Sustainable planning addresses {{the development of}} strategies to reduce the use of resources, increase economic efficiency and improve integration of social aspects (e. g. pedestrian friendly environments, well balanced public and private transport modes, efficient street networks; land use, movement economy; access for all to jobs, retail, services, healthcare, culture, and leisure). In order to reduce urban sprawl, numerous authors recommend {{going back to the}} concept of compact cities. However, policies favoring the compact city concept turned out to be less efficient than expected. Indeed, a large number of households choosing these areas reject urban density since they prefer living in individual houses surrounded by a garden and enjoy a green and calm environment. Hence, instead of rejecting urban sprawl it seems more reasonable to find solutions for better managing the dynamic aspects of cities, in order to reduce traffic costs and pollution, and to avoid undermining natural and agricultural resources. Frankhauser (2004) first proposed reflections onto what extent planning concepts referring to fractal geometry could be of interest for reducing negative impacts of urban sprawl. In a recent research project, financed by the French Ministry of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and Sea in the framework of the PREDIT research program, a planning concept was developed <b>concretizing</b> this basic <b>idea.</b> A planning support system was developed which allows testing the efficiency of the concept (Frankhauser et al 2007, 2008). Let us recall that fractal geometry is based on a hierarchical principle, which has been to be an essential element of urban structures. The hierarchical ordering principle is a cascade of similar elements on different levels of detail: house, block, quarter, district - or: path, residential road, side street, main road, freeway, and highway. According to Read (Read 2000), different scales of hierarchy are distinguished by scales of mobility, and are designed to convey different scales of movement. The spatio-functional pattern describes everyday space use and movement. The above-mentioned fundamental systematic of the built environment requires a structural-analytical approach on all interwoven scales (global to local) for future developments (regional, urban and architectural). The multi-scale logic allows the articulation of residential areas and leisure areas across scales, introducing different levels of service centres according to their frequency of use. These service centres are localized in the nodes of the transportation system thus improving their accessibility with respect to residential areas. This paper addresses a further development of this theoretical model, extending it to be a holistic, comprehensive system. The idea of an "urban" hierarchy (street network, green areas, building blocks, building heights, and urban centres), generated as a multi-scale urban planning model for developing scenarios (regional, urban, architectural scale - 2 D & 3 D) for metropolitan areas, allows the implementation of highly efficient, functional and sustainable transport networks, masterplans and mass models. The comprehensive system presented here can not only simulate growth scenarios but also assesses the quality of an existing area for consolidation and revitalisation (masterplan, urban fringe) or to identify areas with low overall access for a sustainable negative growth scenario (inverse model for shrinking cities and quarters) ...|$|R
