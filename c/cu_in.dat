25|$|Unfortunately, {{the model}} was not free from shortcomings. Since 1973, the growing problem of air {{pollution}} (specially in Mexico City) forced the Mexican government to schedule the beginning of emission certification to all engines produced in the country, which would take effect in 1974. This would affect all high compression engines of all marques. For this reason, the 258 <b>cu</b> <b>in</b> six cylinder had dropped from 8.5:1 to 8.3:1 compression ratio in the change between 1973 and 1974. However, this change {{was not enough to}} comply with the government standards and VAM was forced to decrease compression even more in mid 1974. This meant a final 7.6:1 compression ratio for the 258 <b>cu</b> <b>in</b> six engine for {{the second half of the}} year production of the 1974 Rambler American Rally. For this reason, the aforementioned model along with the 1975 American Rally became the lowest performing examples of VAM's original compact sporty model, ending even below the stock 155hp 232 <b>cu</b> <b>in</b> six cylinder of the 1969 Rambler American Rally and the stock 232 1970-1972 Rambler American two-door sedans.
