The objectives {{of this research was}} to determine the phytochemical content and potency of anti-hypercholesterolemic of <b>cassia</b> <b>vera</b> bark extract using rabbit as the animal model. The research was devided into three stages, namely: (1) preparing <b>cassia</b> <b>vera</b> extraction with ethanol 96 %; (2) analyzing phytochemical contents of <b>cassia</b> <b>vera</b> bark extract; (3) in vivo experiment, where twenty New Zealand White rabbits aged 5 months were used. Experimental rabbits were divided into 5 groups. The rabbits were fed with atherogenic cholesterol (0. 1 %) as positive control, RB 11 standard feed as negative control, or <b>cassia</b> <b>vera</b> extracts (100 mg/kg/day or 200 mg/kg/day) or fenofibrat (15 mg/day) together with the atherogenic feed for 12 weeks. Levels of serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were determined at 0, 4, 8, and 12 week. At the end of the experiment formation of fatty liver were observed. The results showed that the ethanol extract of <b>cassia</b> <b>vera</b> bark contains total phenol (62. 25 %), flavonoids, triterpenoid, saponin and alkaloid. On the other hand, <b>cassia</b> <b>vera</b> bark extract was able to decrease total serum cholesterol from 443. 3 mg/dl to 139. 1 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol from 286. 5 mg/dl to 95. 8 mg/dl and triglyceride from 122. 2 mg/dl to 61. 2 mg/dl. Meanwhile, it increased HDL serum cholesterol from 29. 1 mg/dl to 50. 0 mg/dl in rabbit. It was also shown that the extract was able to decrease the everage fat globule on liver significantly from 27. 47 globule to 3. 59 globule per field view. <b>Cassia</b> <b>vera</b> bark extract with phytochemical content was found to be potential as anti-hypercholesterolemic and also in preventing fatty liver formatonr in rabbi...|$|E
40|$|The {{result of}} {{oleoresin}} from <b>Cassia</b> <b>vera</b> bark by percolation process {{is presented in}} this report. The analyses comprise of the determination of oleoresin yield, essential oil and cinnamic aldehyde. The determination based on oven dry weight revealed that oleoresin yield vary from 6. 27 - 7. 48 percent; essential oil content from 8. 10 - 9. 92 percent and cinnamic aldehyde content from 39. 53 - 41. 59 percent. The optimum yield of oleoresin was produced at temperature of 25 °C and with two hours time of percolation process. Temperature and time of percolation process indicated a non significant effect to the cinnamic aldehyde yield...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to analysethe way in which the {{motherhood}} role isorganised in the media, producingspecific modes of female subjectivation. Based on a Foucaultian framework, Icharacterise enunciating oneself,organising oneself and controllingoneself as techniques of the self used bythe mother-subjects. I thus undertake adiscursive analysis of two sets ofmaterials: one consisting of articlesfrom the magazines Veja and Caras,from 1992 to 2002, about famousmothers (<b>Cássia</b> Eller, LucianaGimenez, <b>Vera</b> Fischer and Xuxa); and,the other, consisting of articlespublished in the magazine Crescer,between January 2001 and July 2002. Ishow how this mechanism organisesthese techniques of the self in order tocreate a logic where the mother-indivi-dual is asked to focus on herself andconsider that taking care of herself istaking care of the other (her son) and,in this way, leading the mother-individuals to recognise themselves asobjects visible to themselves and toenunciate themselves as subjectstransformed by maternal practices...|$|R
50|$|Product {{interaction}} {{is when a}} consumer comes into contact with a businesses physical product, whether it be directly or indirectly (Stein, & Ramaseshan, 2016). Product interaction involves: quality of the product(s), assortment of products, direct and indirect interactions with the product (Stein, & Ramaseshan, 2016). When customers start interacting with a product, it gives them tangible evidence about the good and whether it meets the perceived value, from the pre-purchase stage. If the product does not meet expectations, the business overall could be viewed {{in a negative way}} and vice <b>vera</b> (<b>Cassia,</b> Ugolini, Cobelli, & Gill, 2015). Businesses should also ensure that they have a large assortment of the goods available, in-store or otherwise, this can means have a large range of sizes for clothing, and a large number of each size, or even having an item in differing colours to give the customers options (Cassia et al., 2015).|$|R
