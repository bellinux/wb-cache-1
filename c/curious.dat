5|$|In my {{time that}} <b>curious</b> {{railroad}} by the Whitby Moor {{was so much}} the more <b>curious,</b> that you were balanced against a counter-weight of water, and that you did it like Blondin. But in these remote days the one inn of Whitby was up a back-yard, and oyster-shell grottoes were the only view from the best private room.|$|E

5|$|Eli Marienthal as Hogarth Hughes, a 9-year-old {{energetic}} and <b>curious</b> boy with an active imagination. Marienthal's performances were videotaped {{and given to}} animators to work with, which helped develop expressions and acting for the character.|$|E
5|$|In many {{renditions}} of the myth, Manasa {{is depicted as}} being quite dependent on Neta (traditionally imagined as a washerwoman) for ideas and moral support. In fact, of the two, Manasa is often the stupider one - a <b>curious</b> instance of anthropomorphism.|$|E

5|$|Clumber Spaniels shed at {{a medium}} pace. Clumbers tend to drool {{because of their}} very droopy flews. Clumbers have minds of their own. Puppies are {{especially}} <b>curious</b> and playful.

5|$|Common ravens {{are known}} to steal and cache shiny objects such as pebbles, pieces of metal, and golf balls. One theory is that they hoard shiny objects to impress other ravens.

Mature birds lose their intense interest in the unusual, and become highly neophobic.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, Paul retains {{elements}} of a powerful and alert patriarch.

5|$|Of {{the diverse}} {{religious}} buildings the 18th century Baroque churches are prominent: the Matriz Church, the Senhora das Dores Church and its six chapels, and the fishermen Lapa Church, with its <b>curious</b> Lapa Lighthouse.

Among their wedding gifts was a maplewood desk from Queen Victoria, now at Inveraray Castle.|$|E
5|$|The really <b>curious</b> part of {{this story}} is that, after {{everything}} had been explained, and all had been restored to their normal courses of action, none of the personages involved in it married each other. They were all so annoyed at having made such fools of themselves that they {{walked out of the}} inn in different directions, and were never seen or heard of again.|$|E
5|$|These Sermons are curious; and <b>curious</b> {{for such}} reason as would make other works despicable. They {{were written in}} a {{careless}} hurrying manner; and were the offspring of necessity, not of choice: so that one will see the original force of the Dean's genius more in these compositions, that were the legitimate sons of duty, than in other pieces that were natural sons of love.|$|E
5|$|Vauxhall Gardens is peculiarly {{adapted to}} {{the taste of the}} English nation; there being a mixture of <b>curious</b> show, — gay exhibition, musick, vocal and instrumental, not too refined for the general ear; — for all of which only a {{shilling}} is paid; and, though last, not least, good eating and drinking for those who choose to purchase that regale.|$|E
