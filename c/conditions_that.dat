According to him, if she was killed, he would go free. Raynor made the decision right there and blocked a shot from Tychus, intended for Kerrigan, and he shot his friend dead.|$|E
5|$|At {{the initial}} consultation, {{patients}} are screened for <b>conditions</b> <b>that</b> may contraindicate the diet.

5|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} {{was first}} described by Northway in 1967, who outlined the <b>conditions</b> <b>that</b> {{would lead to}} the diagnosis. This was later expanded by Bancalari and in 1988 by Shennan, who suggested the need for supplemental oxygen at 36weeks could predict long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, Palta et al. in 1998 concluded that radiographic evidence was the most accurate predictor of long-term effects.|$|E
50|$|The Glauberman {{replacement}} theorem is similar, except p {{is assumed}} to be odd and the <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> B is abelian is weakened to the <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> B,B commutes with B and with all elements of A. Glauberman says in his paper that he does not know whether the <b>condition</b> <b>that</b> p is odd is necessary.|$|R

5|$|Diagnosis {{is based}} on a person's {{symptoms}} and history of medication use.

5|$|Diagnosis of a {{pneumothorax}} {{by physical}} examination alone {{can be difficult}} (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence. Other <b>conditions</b> <b>that</b> can result in similar symptoms include a hemothorax (buildup {{of blood in the}} pleural space), pulmonary embolism, and heart attack. A large bullae may look similar on a chest X-ray.|$|E

5000|$|A semi-stable {{curve is}} one {{satisfying}} similar <b>conditions,</b> except <b>that</b> the automorphism group {{is allowed to}} be reductive rather than finite (or equivalently its connected component may be a torus).

5|$|FH {{needs to}} be {{distinguished}} from familial combined hyperlipidemia and polygenic hypercholesterolemia. Lipid levels {{and the presence of}} xanthomata can confirm the diagnosis. Sitosterolemia and cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis are two rare <b>conditions</b> <b>that</b> can also present with premature atherosclerosis and xanthomas. The latter condition can also involve neurological or psychiatric manifestations, cataracts, diarrhea and skeletal abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|Following the Spanish–American War, {{which gave}} Cuba its {{independence}} from Spain, many anarchists were dissatisfied with the <b>conditions</b> <b>that</b> persisted after independence. They cited <b>conditions</b> <b>that</b> were perpetuated by the new government, like suppression of labor movements, US occupations, and dissatisfaction with the school systems. By 1899, anarchist workers had reorganized themselves, under the Alianza de Trabajadores (Worker's Alliance). By September of this year, five of the groups organizers had been arrested, following a mason's strike which spread {{to all of the}} construction trade. Around this time, anarchist organizer Errico Malatesta visited Cuba, giving speeches, and interviews to several periodicals, but was soon barred from further speaking engagements by civil governor Emilio Nuñez. Around 1902-03, anarchists and other labor organizers began to attempt to organize the sugar industry, then the largest industry in Cuba. But owners responded quickly, and two workers were murdered, and the crimes never solved.|$|E
5|$|Geysers are {{temporary}} geological features. Geysers {{are generally}} associated with volcanic areas. As the water boils, the resulting pressure forces a superheated column of steam {{and water to}} the surface through the geyser's internal plumbing. The formation of geysers specifically requires the combination of three geologic <b>conditions</b> <b>that</b> are usually found in volcanic terrain.|$|E
