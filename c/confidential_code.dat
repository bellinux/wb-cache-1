Additionally, the IRA had co-opted most of the Irish servants who worked in the rooming houses where the D Branch officers lived, and all of their comings and goings were meticulously recorded by servants and reported to Collins's staff.|$|E
40|$|Protecting {{source code}} against reverse {{engineering}} and theft {{is an important}} problem. The goal is to carry out computations using confidential algorithms on an untrusted party while ensuring confidentiality of algorithms. This problem has been addressed for Boolean circuits known as `circuit privacy'. Circuits corresponding to real-world programs are impractical. Well-known obfuscation techniques are highly practicable, but provide only limited security, e. g., no piracy protection. In this work, we modify source code yielding programs with adjustable performance and security guarantees ranging from indistinguishability obfuscators to (non-secure) ordinary obfuscation. The idea is to artificially generate `misleading' statements. Their results are combined with {{the outcome of a}} confidential statement using encrypted selector variables. Thus, an attacker must `guess' the encrypted selector variables to disguise the <b>confidential</b> source <b>code.</b> We evaluated our method using more than ten programmers as well as pattern mining across open source code repositories to gain insights of (micro-) coding patterns that are relevant for generating misleading statements. The evaluation reveals that our approach is effective in that it successfully preserves source code confidentiality...|$|R

40|$|It is {{accepted}} in principle that {{social and cultural}} factors are important {{for the study of}} the individual, family and community use of technologies. Design too aims to be user-centred. The tussle in community informatics, as with human-computer interaction, lies in communicating and translating the importance of the social and cross-cultural factors to technologists, designers, businesses and policy makers. Focusing on issues of security, I show that communication and translation are particularly difficult when social and cultural practices challenge the assumptions of design and policy. In security design, for instance, it is assumed a person will be using <b>confidential</b> access <b>codes</b> for his or her individual computer to conduct transactions. Consumer protection policy in Australia also makes these assumptions. It is also assumed that a person will be using an individual computer. Social and cultural practices challenge these technical and policy assumptions for two reasons. Drawing on a study of banking in Australia I show that the practice of sharing passwords for Internet banking is not uncommon among married and de facto couples. Sharing passwords for ATMs and EFTPOS is also not unknown. The second assumption of individual personal access is dramatically challenged in developing countries like India where public rather personal Internet access is the norm. When security designers and professionals start from social and cultural practice, they have to design for shared use of access codes and the public use of communications devices. It is only with such social and cross cultural designs that community needs will be well served in both the developed and developing countries...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{determine}} {{prevalence of}} human papillomavirus (HPV) in Wellington women, to identify {{risk factors for}} HPV infection, to correlate presence of HPV with cervical cytology, and to identify characteristics of women infected with HPV but with normal cytology. DESIGN [...] Demographic, social, personal and clinical data were collected by a <b>confidential</b> self-administered <b>coded</b> questionnaire. The presence of DNA from HPV types 6 / 11, 16 + 18 and 31 + 33 in cervical scrapes was determined by dot-blot DNA hybridisation. All data were correlated with cervical cytology results. SETTING AND SUBJECTS [...] Two thousand and twenty one women attending family planning clinics in the Wellington region participated in the study. The mean age of participants was 26 years, 33. 3 % currently smoked, 72. 3 % used hormonal contraceptives, 31. 4 % were married, and 91. 4 % were of European origin. RESULTS [...] We found 10. 9 % of the study group infected with HPV. HPV types 16 and/or 18 predominated, being detected in 71. 5 % of HPV-positive women either alone or with other types. Of those infected 26. 2 % had multiple infections. Dysplasia (n = 87) or atypia (n = 84) were observed in 26. 7 % of infected women (n = 221) and 6. 25 % of uninfected women (n = 1792). Over 8 % of women with normal smears were HPV positive, and types 16 / 18 were most common in these women. CONCLUSIONS [...] Women with cervical dysplasia or atypia were six {{times more likely to}} have HPV infection than other women. The main risk factor for HPV infection, particularly with types 16 and/or 18, was multiple (> 5) sexual partners in the last year independent of other variables.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new security model for protecting software confidentiality. Di#erent {{from the previous}} processcentric systems designed for the same purpose, the new model ties cryptographic properties and security attributes to memory instead of a user process. The advantages of such memory centric design over the previous process-centric design are two folds. First, it provides a better security model and access control on software confidentiality that supports both selective and mixed software encryption. Second, the new model supports and facilitates information sharing in an open software system where both <b>confidential</b> data and <b>code</b> could be shared by di#erent user processes without unnecessary duplication {{as required by the}} process-centric approach. Furthermore, the paper addresses the latency issue of executing one-time-pad (OTP) encrypted software through a novel OTP prediction technique. One-time-pad based protection schemes on data confidentiality can improve performance over block-cipher based protection approaches by parallelizing data fetch and OTP generation when a sequence number associated with a missing cache block is cached on-chip. On a sequence number cache miss, OTP generation can not be started until the missing sequence number is fetched from the memory. Since the latency of OTP generation is in the magnitude of the order of hundreds of core CPU cycles, it becomes performance critical to have OTP ready as soon as possible. OTP prediction meets this challenge by using idle decryption engine cycles to speculatively compute OTPs for memory blocks whose sequence number are missing in the cache. Profiling and simulation results show that significant performance improvement using speculative OTP over regular OTP under both small 4 KB and large seque [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to find a}} new gasket {{material}} to be used in frequency converters manufactured by ABB. The new material has to comply to RoHS directive, because this material is going to replace the currently used material, which is not RoHS compliant. The material is going to be used in conditions, where it may be subjected to chemicals and especially oils, so it should have a good resistance to both. In addition to finding the material, this thesis considers factors affecting elastomer’s swelling in oil. Some requirements were set for the gasket material. The hardness of the material should not be over 60 Shore A and its tear strength should not be less than 23 kN/m. The material should also have a fire classification minimum of V 1. The most important criterion was the oil resistance. Gasket material should not swell more than 25 percent from its initial volume when immersed in oil. The literature part of this thesis consists of introducing four material groups which have such properties which are required from the gasket material and considers those properties. These four groups are thermoplastic polyurethanes, styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene, thermoplastic vulcanizate elastomers and co-polyester based elasto-mers. The literature part also discusses the factors which help estimate the amount of swelling based on the structure of the thermoplastic elastomer. The experiment part of this thesis introduces immersion tests which have been used to determine oil resistance of the test materials. Six materials were tested, the names of the materials are <b>confidential,</b> they are <b>coded</b> to be Materials A, B, C, D, E and F. From these results, the best suited material for the new gasket material was elected. Also from the results, it was possible to determine dependence of swelling on volume, area, vo-lume/area ratio and density of the sample. One suitable material was found in addition to a few others that require more test-ing. The only geometrical factor found to contribute materials swelling was volume/area ratio. Once the graph is made for a certain material, it helps to predict the swelling of a sample with a certain volume/area ratio made from the same material. The tests made for this thesis will continue after this thesis is completed. Some new sample geometries and new materials will be tested. /Kir 1...|$|R

40|$|Braća Antun i Mihovil Vrančić u svojem su se dopisivanju povremeno služila kodiranim porukama. Zahvaljujući istraživanju D. Sorić i autora ovog rada Mihovilove su šifre nedavno odgonetnute, dok je kratki Antunov šifrirani zapis ostao neproničan. Naime, u pismu iz Francuske 1546. godine Antun se poslužio drugačijim šiframa od onih kojima se kasnije koristio Mihovil. U ovom radu pokazuje se kako je napokon odgonetnuta i Antunova šifra. U tom poslu frekvencija znakova slabo je pomagala jer je poruka vrlo kratka. Koncentracija na prvu riječ također nije vodila pravim putem, budući da su prva dva znaka, kako se poslije ustanovilo, »prazna«, namijenjena zavaravanju nepozvanih čitatelja. Ni oslanjanje na analogne sintaktičke situacije nije dalo ploda. Tek su pokušaji pogađanja ključne riječi doveli do rješenja: u sklopu vijesti o dobrom prijemu kod francuskog kralja Antun tajno priopćuje Mihovilu kako bi uskoro mogao javiti »velike stvari« svojim vlastima u Transilvaniji. Po jednom Antunovu pismu iz vremena nakon francuske misije jasno je da se njegov diplomatski posao ticao austrijskog kralja Ferdinanda. Sudeći po povijesnom kontekstu vjerojatno se radilo o još jednom prijedlogu austrijsko-erdeljskog sporazuma, koji je naišao na blagonaklon prijem francuskoga kralja Franje I. Not {{merely to}} be up to date with humanist fashion, but also out of the genuine necessities of life, the Šibenik {{brothers}} Antun and Mihovil Vrančić corresponded throughout the whole of their lives. Sometimes, they would write <b>confidential</b> information in <b>code.</b> Mihovil’s secret reports were discussed in the last number of Colloquia Maruliana by Diana Sorić {{and the author of the}} present work, but at that time a short coded missive by Antun still eluded comprehension. In this paper, I report on the deciphering of this fragment, encoded in a letter sent from France in 1546. In the very first words of this letter, Antun boasts of having been well received by the king and of everything going his way. The continuation of the sentence is written in secret signs. Since these are different from Mihovil’s, they needed decoding. The first attempt, based on a comparison of frequency of signs and the frequency of signs in the Latin text, was not useful, for Antun’s message is too short (just a line and a half) for such an approach. It seemed then to be useful to start out from the first signs, assuming that they must have contained the beginning of some word. It became clear that in these first signs, the fifth and the seventh were the same, and so the remainder of Antun’s family letters were searched for a similar combination. A check of some eighty letters revealed that not a single possible choice corresponded with the rest of the message. Accordingly I tried using Antun’s syntactical habits in consecutive clauses (for the message consists of such a passage). I set out from the assumption that in the code there might be some active future participle, which would be useful for recognition purposes if it were in the singular, for in the -uru-section of the participle the u is repeated after the second sign. But this attempt came to nothing too. All that remained was to play on chance: to attempt to guess some word that could be expected from the context. And indeed, there was such a word, Transsilvania, which was apt in that it had the double ss, capable of being associated with the repeated sign dd in the coded text. A word this long filled in at once more than a quarter of the unknown text, and its component parts another half, and so the rest did not offer many difficulties. Only the beginning remained a problem. The first two symbols cannot be meaningfully fitted in, and so they can be interpreted as red herrings, as used by code makers to confuse code breakers. The other signs clearly hide some passive form of the verb mittere, the meaning of which fits in well with the continuation of the text, but to obtain the appropriate form, it has to be assumed that there is one more »empty« sign and one mistake by Antun. In any event, it turns out that Antun was writing to Mihovil that he might soon be able to report »great things« to his second homeland, Transylvania, in the diplomacy of which he was serving. But even after the decoding of the text, the task of Antun at the French court remains a riddle. Looking in the circumstances of the time and among other Vrančić letters for more definite elements for an answer, I concluded that it must have been to do with Transylvanian-Austrian relations. After the death of Louis II at the Battle of Mohács, a dispute about the succession in Transylvania broke out, one that was to last a century and a half. A year or two before Antun’s arrival in France, Charles V of Habsburg signed a treaty with the King François I of France, Transylvanian ally, and then with Suleiman, thus freeing his forces and those of his brother Ferdinand for other designs. Juraj Utišenić (Georgius Utissenius), the leading man of Transylvanian politics, must have recognised the danger that had thus arisen. From one of Antun’s letters from the time after the French mission it is clear that his embassy to France concerned Austrian King Ferdinand. Judging from the historical context, this was probably one of a number of proposals for an Austrian-Transylvanian compact. Antun’s satisfaction expressed in the coded text elicits the conclusion that the proposal had met with a good reception from François I...|$|R
