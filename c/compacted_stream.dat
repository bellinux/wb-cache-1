40|$|Stream {{compaction}} is {{an important}} parallel computing primitive that produces a reduced (compacted) output stream consisting of only valid elements from an input stream containing both invalid and valid elements. Computing on this <b>compacted</b> <b>stream</b> rather than the mixed input stream leads to improvements in performance, load balancing and memory footprint. Stream compaction has numerous applications {{in a wide range}} of domains: e. g. deferred shading, isosurface extraction and surface voxelization in computer graphics and visualization. We present a novel In-Kernel stream compaction method, where compaction is completed before leaving an operating kernel. This contrasts with conventional parallel compaction methods that require leaving the kernel and running a prefix sum kernel followed by a scatter kernel. We apply our compaction methods to ray-tracing-based visualization of volumetric data. We demonstrate that the proposed In-Kernel compaction outperforms the standard out-of-kernel Thrust parallel-scan method for performing stream compaction in this real-world application. For the data visualization, we also propose a novel multi-kernel ray-tracing pipeline for increased thread coherency and show that it outperforms a conventional single-kernel approach...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Grain {{is one of}} {{the eight}} finalists in the {{hardware}} category of the eSTREAM stream cipher contest, and has shown itself {{to be one of the}} fastest and most <b>compact</b> <b>stream</b> ciphers in the competition. Time / memory / data tradeoffs are a class of generic attacks that modern stream ciphers should resist. We show that Grain has a low resistance to BSW sampling, leading to tradeoffs that in the active phase recover the internal state of Grain v 1 using O(2 71) time and memory, and O(2 53. 5) bits of known keystream. While the practical significance of these tradeoffs may be arguable due to the precomputation costs involved, their existence clearly violate stated design assumptions in the Grain specification, and parallels may be drawn to the similar cryptanalytic results on and the subsequent tweak of MICKEY v 1. ...|$|R

In this work we introduce a fault attack on the CAESAR candidate ACORN v 2. Our attack is done under the assumption of random fault injection into an initial state of ACORN v 2 and contains two main steps: fault locating and equation solving. At the first step, we first present a fundamental fault locating method, which uses 99 -bit output keystream to determine the fault injected location with probability 97. 08 %. And then several improvements are provided, which can further increase the probability of fault locating to almost 1. As for the system of equations retrieved at the first step, we give two solving methods at the second step, that is, linearization and guess-and-determine. The time complexity of our attack is not larger than c· 2179. 19 - 1. 76 N at worst, where N is the number of fault injections such that 31 ≤N≤ 88 and c is the time complexity of solving linear equations.

Unlike conventional approaches, it does not use X-masking logic at the input of the MISR.

Linearly dependent combinations of the signature bits are identified with Gaussian elimination and XORed together to cancel out all X values and yield deterministic values. This new X-canceling approach was applied to some industrial designs under the constraints imposed by an industrial test environment. Practical issues for implementing X-canceling are discussed, and a new architecture for implementing X-canceling based on using a shadow register with multiple selective XORs is presented.

40|$|The article {{considers}} a possibility {{to use the}} ultrajet diagnostics methods for definition of ceramics operational characteristics at the stage of production. The ultrajet technology means a complex of processing methods or research of constructional materials, which are subjected to the high-speed <b>compact</b> <b>stream</b> of liquid. In particular, the article considers the test method of the constructional ceramics used {{as a means of}} an armored protection, which means the influence of an water ultrajet flowing out at high speed (800 m/s) from a nozzle with a diameter of 0, 1 mm. By quantity of the ceramics, which has been taken away from a zone of ultrajet influence, the article draws conclusion concerning the operational properties of a studied sample of ceramics. Apart from a widely used method of ceramics shooting, this way allows us to obtain information on a studied armor without using special equipment (the ballistic stand). However, the goal of the offered way is to obtain information on operational characteristics of a sample at the stage of production, the subsequent tests using shooting thus are not excluded. The possibility to use the ultrajet diagnostics methods as an addition to shooting is revealed from results of the experiments made with samples of ceramics after three types of tests such as shooting using a rigid drummer, ultrajet impact on a sample (including that of with using abrasive particles available in liquid), and static loading tests of samples. By results of each type of tests the misrostructure analysis of demolition zone of samples was carried out. The analysis has shown a similarity of a microstructure of dynamic influence zone on the samples subjected to shooting by the rigid drummer and an ultrajet (including that of with available abrasive particles). Thus, at static tests the demolition zone was essentially different in microstructure from the samples under dynamic trials. So, the conclusion was drawn that the ultrajet diagnostics method is admissible for use in retrieving more information about a sample at the stage of production. </p...|$|R

40|$|Many {{science and}} {{engineering}} applications use high-resolution unstructured hexahedral meshes to model solid 3 D shapes for finite element simulations. These simulations frequently dump the mesh and associated fields to disk for subsequent analysis, which involves the transfer of huge volumes of data. To reduce requirements on disk space and bandwidth, we propose efficient schemes for lossless online compression of hexahedral mesh geometry and connectivity. Our approach is to use hash-based value predictors to transform the mesh connectivity list into a more <b>compact</b> byte-aligned <b>stream</b> of symbols that can then be efficiently compressed using conventional text compressors such as gzip. Our scheme is memory efficient, fast, and simple to implement, and yields 1 – 3 orders of magnitude reduction {{on a set of}} benchmark meshes. For geometry and field coding, we derive a set of local spectral predictors optimized for each possible configuration of previously encoded and thus available vertices within a hexahedron. Combined with lossless floating-point residual coding, this approach improves considerably upon prior predictive geometry coding schemes. 1...|$|R

40|$|At or {{near the}} end of the Cretaceous, at least two large impact events {{occurred}} in the western hemisphere. One impact formed the 180 -km diameter Chicxulub crater on the northern tip of the Yucatan peninsula. Another formed the 35 -km diameter Manson structure in western Iowa. Several lines of evidence, including the chemical and isotopic composition of glass found in the K/T boundary layer at sites in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean region, the regional variation in thickness and the size of spherules in the K/T boundary layer, and indications at and near the boundary of disturbance and deposition of beds by giant waves in the Gulf of Mexico, point to Chicxulub as a major source of K/T boundary material, including a lower layer of clay at K/T boundary sites in western North America. The size, abundance, and mineral and lithic composition of shocked grains from an upper K/T boundary layer found at western North American sites, on the other hand, point to Manson as a possible source crater. More than one impact seems to be indicated by the K/T boundary stratigraphy in western North America, and present constraints on the age of the Manson structure suggest that it, as well as Chicxulub, may be a K/T boundary crater. Multiple craters produced over a relatively short interval of time are much more likely to have been formed by impact of comets rather than by impact of asteroids. Among likely mechanisms that could have produced multiple craters at {{or near the}} time of the K/T boundary are as follows: (1) splitting of a comet shortly before impact with Earth (impacts may have been spaced over about an hour), (2) fragmentation of a very large, Sun-grazing, periodic comet to form a <b>compact</b> <b>stream</b> of comets that intercepted the Earth's orbit (impacts may have been spread over about a century), and (3) perturbation of the Oort comet cloud by a passing massive object to form a comet shower in the inner solar system (impacts may have been spread over about a million years). Only in the first two cases are the impacts likely to have been close enough in time to contribute to the observed K/T boundary layers.

40|$|A new X-tolerant multiple-input {{signature}} register (MISR) compaction methodology {{is proposed}} which can <b>compact</b> output <b>streams</b> containing unknown (X) values. Unlike conventional X-masking approaches, {{it does not}} require any masking logic at the input of the MISR. Instead it uses symbolic simulation to express each bit of the MISR signature as a linear equation in terms of the X’s. Linearly dependent combinations of the signature bits are identified with Gaussian elimination and XORed together using a programmable XOR to cancel out all X values thereby yielding deterministic values that are invariant of what the final values of the X’s end up being during the test. These X-canceled values can be compacted in a separate MISR to generate a final X-free signature. Each intermediate signature for an m-bit MISR can tolerate k X’s present anywhere in the output stream with error detection capability equivalent to using an m-k bit MISR with no unknowns. The tester storage requirement is a small constant times the total number of unknowns in the test set and thus does not depend on the scan architecture, the number of test vectors, or the distribution of X’s which is a key advantage compared with other X-tolerant compaction schemes. 1...|$|R
50|$|E1Designated as Experiment 1 in {{the fall}} of 1940, the initial model {{consisting}} of four main components: fuel storage system, compressed gas storage system, igniter, and flame gun. The E1 had a single fuel tank vertical cylinder with two compartments, an upper and lower compartment. The upper compartment contained pressurized nitrogen that pushed the five gallons of fuel oil in the lower compartment through the barrel and into the flame gun. The fuel system for the E1 consisted of either diesel oil, fuel oil, or blends of gasoline and oil. An igniter, consisting of a compressed hydrogen cylinder and battery, was attached to the flame gun. The flame gun had two triggers, dispense fuel and ignition of fuel as it exited the metal barrel.Weighing in at 70 pounds when filled, the E1 was capable of ranges from fourteen to twenty-one yards. Issues - engineer board tests identified that the fuel-compressed gas reservoir was impractical, prone position firing was difficult, and as the E1 was firing, gas pressure decreased in the upper compartment tank lowering gas pressure to push the fuel in the lower compartment through the flame gun, thereby reducing weapon range. Additional issues were identified with the dependability, weight, and maneuverability of the E1 flame thrower system. E1R1The E1 was redesigned by the Chemical Warfare Service and labeled Experiment 1 Revision 1 and was ready for testing in March 1941. The compressed nitrogen was separated away from the fuel reservoir, a feature carried forward in all subsequent models. Additional improvements included the flame gun, valves, and ignition system. The E1R1's filled weight was reduced to 57 pounds and was capable of sustaining 15 to 20 yards for 15 to 20 seconds; the E1R1 weighed 28 pounds when empty. Issues - Weight, easily damaged parts, and access to the control valves were identified during testing as being problematic. M1Test board results {{led to the development of}} the M1 production model, consisting of a heavier weight, the M1 was more rugged and had a longer range as standardized for production in March 1942. The M1 system made it to the South Pacific theater by the end of the year. M1A1The invention of napalm led to its evaluation as a flamethrowing agent. Gasoline and oil mixtures sprayed as it left the barrel of the flame gun, whereas napalm thickened fuel left the barrel in a <b>compact</b> <b>stream</b> capable of ricocheting off of and into openings and subsequently sticking to flat surfaces. Initial tests showed that the current M1 platform was incapable of providing the ideal range with napalm. The Chemical Warfare Service was asked to adapt the napalm fuel system to the M1 platform to avoid procurement issues, thus facilitating the development of the M1A1 platform. Modifications included the fuel system, pressure regulator, valves, and the flame gun to facilitate the higher pressures required to achieve ideal ranges with the napalm. The M1A1 was capable of reliably firing to distances fifty yards away versus the M1's ideal firing range of twenty yards.|$|R

Additionally missing transverse momentum from non-interacting particles provides an interesting probe {{in the search for}} new physics beyond the Standard Model. Developing trigger selections that target these events is a huge challenge at the LHC due to the enormous event rates associated with these signatures.

Sufficient conditions for the optimality of the greedy ordering are established: it is optimal for the ZF V-BLAST under an optimal rate allocation with two transmit antennas at any SNR and with any number of antennas in the low and high SNR regimes. It satisfies the necessary optimality conditions for larger systems at any SNR and is nearly-optimal in many cases. An SNR gain of ordering is introduced and studied, including closed-form expressions as well as lower and upper bounds and the conditions for their achievability. For the minimum mean square error (MMSE) V-BLAST under an optimal rate allocation, any ordering is shown to deliver the same system capacity.
