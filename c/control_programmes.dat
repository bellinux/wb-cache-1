5|$|Birds {{that employ}} many {{strategies}} to obtain food or feed {{on a variety}} of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists. Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Echinostomiasis can be {{controlled}} {{at the same time}} as other food-borne parasite infections, using existing <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> Interrupting the parasite’s lifecycle by efficient diagnosis and subsequent treatment of infected individuals, and preventing reinfection, may help to control this disease. As echinostomiasis is acquired through the consumption of raw or undercooked infected food, cooking food thoroughly will prevent infection.|$|E
25|$|A 1997 {{survey of}} 35 {{countries}} found rates above 2% {{in about a}} third of the countries surveyed. The highest rates were in the former USSR, the Baltic states, Argentina, India and China, and was associated with poor or failing national Tuberculosis <b>Control</b> <b>programmes.</b> Likewise, the appearance of high rates of MDR-TB in New York city the early 1990s was associated with the dismantling of public health programmes by the Reagan administration.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from the}} generalist aphid and scale predators and {{incidental}} substances of botanical origin, many Coccinellidae do favour or even specialise in certain prey types. This makes {{some of them}} particularly valuable as agents in biological <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> Determination of specialisation {{need not be a}} trivial matter, though; for example the larva of the Vedalia ladybird Rodolia cardinalis is a specialist predator on a few species of Monophlebidae, in particular Icerya purchasi, which is the most notorious of the cottony cushion scale species. However, the adult R. cardinalis can subsist for some months on a wider range of insects plus some nectar.|$|E
25|$|The {{regional}} council, {{responsible for}} managing natural and physical resources, provides flood protection and monitors environmental {{problems such as}} pest infestation and pollution. Invasive plant pests such as African feathergrass, goats rue and nodding thistle {{pose a threat to}} pastureland in this heavily agricultural-dependent region, and the council has instituted control campaigns. The council has also instituted animal pest <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> Possums are perceived as the major animal pest since they damage native forests and endanger cattle production through the spread of bovine tuberculosis. Eradication programmes also concentrate on rabbits, rooks and feral goats, while other exotic species such as Parma wallaby (Macropus parma), wasps, ferrets, stoats and weasels are a source of concern.|$|E
25|$|Tarebia granifera {{have been}} {{associated}} with the disappearance of two indigenous benthic gastropod species from rivers in Puerto Rico and have displaced the vegetation-associated pulmonate Biomphalaria glabrata from streams and ponds on several Caribbean islands. Although the responsible mechanism is not understood, this has led to suggestions that it could be useful as a biocontrol agent in snail control operations within integrated schistosomiasis <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> They probably also compete for space and resources (e.g. food) with indigenous infaunal and epifaunal invertebrates, especially where its densities are high. Under such conditions it is likely to alter the structure and biodiversity of the entire benthic communities of invaded habitats and perhaps the vegetation-associated communities as well.|$|E

The authors concluded that [...] "Finding DDT resistance in the vector An. arabiensis, close to the area where we previously reported pyrethroid-resistance in the vector An. funestus Giles, indicates an urgent {{need to develop a}} strategy of insecticide resistance management for the malaria <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> of southern Africa." ...|$|E

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the current weed <b>control</b> <b>programme</b> on the Poor Knights Islands has highlighted a number factors which will have a bearing on future management of the islands. Principally, {{the goal of this}} programme is not eradication of the target species but is sustained control. The difference between these two goals is important and needs to be understood by managers. In addition, the major factor which will prolong the term of the weed <b>control</b> <b>programme</b> on the Poor Knights is the massive seed source on the adjacent mainland. Efforts need to be made to. reduce populations of weed species on the mainland by working with landowners and regional or district councils. A small number of species could be considered for addition to the <b>control</b> <b>programme.</b> Lastly, the current <b>control</b> <b>programme</b> is very soundly based and just a few minor suggestions are made which should improve its effectiveness. 1...|$|R
