5|$|The labour {{spent by}} Dr. Scrivener upon Textual <b>Criticism</b> <b>is</b> well known from his admirable Introduction to the Science, a {{handbook}} which leaves hardly anything, if anything, to be desired.|$|E
5|$|In his {{biography}} of Hick, David Cheetham notes {{a criticism of}} Hick's theory: waiting for eschatological verification could make religious belief provisional, preventing total commitment to faith. Cheetham argues that such <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> misapplied because Hick's theory was not directed to religious believers but to philosophers, who argued that religion is unverifiable and therefore meaningless.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> that {{outcomes}} {{are presented in}} terms of relative risk reduction to exaggerate the apparent benefits of the treatment. For example, he writes, if four people out of 1,000 will {{have a heart attack}} within the year, but on statins only two will, that is a 50 percent reduction if expressed as relative risk reduction. But if expressed as absolute risk reduction, it is a reduction of just 0.2 percent.|$|E
50|$|Two main <b>criticisms</b> <b>were</b> {{directed}} against REBES. The first criticism {{relates to the}} system itself. The second <b>criticism</b> <b>was</b> {{directed against}} the general, systematic bias of the early expert systems in criminal investigation.|$|R
50|$|These strong <b>criticisms</b> <b>were</b> {{summarised}} {{by independent}} sources {{and can be}} read here http://www.expresionlibre.org/site2/estados/noti_0642.php or here http://eljustoreclamo.blogspot.com/2008/01/chiapas-operacin-fracaso-comunidades.html. A further clear set of <b>criticisms</b> <b>are</b> summarised here http://www.rmalc.org.mx/documentos/libros/libro%20EU-boell.pdf that take Prodesis as a case study.|$|R
50|$|Early <b>criticism</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} by van den Bergh and Verbruggen in 1999, which was updated in 2014. Another <b>criticism</b> <b>was</b> published in 2008. A more complete review {{commissioned by the}} Directorate-General for the Environment (European Commission) was published in June 2008.|$|R
5|$|Hume also {{suggested}} that, {{as we have}} no abstract idea of existence (apart from {{as part of our}} ideas of other objects), we cannot claim that the idea of God implies his existence. He suggested that any conception of God we may have, we can conceive either of existing or of not existing. He believed that existence is not a quality (or perfection), so a completely perfect being need not exist. Thus, he claimed {{that it is not a}} contradiction to deny God's existence. Although this <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> directed against a cosmological argument, similar to that of Samuel Clarke in his first Boyle Lecture, it has been applied to ontological arguments as well.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial {{deference to the}} executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, {{it is crucial that}} the court should not merely rely on international law to determine the meaning of the liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.|$|E
5|$|One {{point of}} <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> {{that the film}} gives a {{misleading}} impression of the whereabouts and magnitude of Kony's remaining LRA forces. As of early 2012, Kony's followers were thought to number only in the hundreds, and Kony himself {{was believed to be}} in the Central African Republic rather than Ugandaâ€”a fact that receives only a passing mention in the video. This problem raised questions about the plausibility of Ugandan army intervention, which the video advocates. Since Kony and most of the LRA forces are currently not in Uganda, the Ugandan army would need to coordinate with the governments and militaries of the other countries where the LRA is active.|$|E

50|$|What {{sorts of}} <b>criticism</b> <b>are</b> acceptable.|$|R
5000|$|... "Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language", {{a popular}} {{criticism}} of Niklaus Wirth's Pascal. Some {{parts of the}} <b>criticism</b> <b>are</b> obsolete due to ISO 7185 (Programming Languages - Pascal); the <b>criticism</b> <b>was</b> written before ISO 7185 was created. (AT&T Computing Science Technical Report #100) ...|$|R
5|$|Since {{much of the}} <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> {{the result}} of photos and videos taken during the hunt and {{slaughter}}, it is now common for the final capture and slaughter to take place on site inside a tent or under a plastic cover, out of sight from the public. The most circulated footage is probably that of the drive and subsequent capture and slaughter process taken in Futo in October 1999 (a still {{of which can be}} seen on the right), shot by the Japanese animal welfare organization Elsa Nature Conservancy. Part of this footage was, amongst others, shown on CNN.|$|E
5|$|While {{continuing}} {{work on the}} Cronica and {{detailing the}} enormous loss of life during the Black Death in 1348, Villani died of the same illness. His work on the Cronica was continued by his brother and nephew. Villani's work has received both praise and criticism from modern historians. The <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> mostly aimed at his emphasis on supernatural guidance of events, his organizational style, and his glorification of the papacy and Florence.|$|E
5|$|The {{sale of the}} Olympic brand {{has been}} controversial. The {{argument}} is that the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialised sporting spectacle. Specific criticism was levelled at the IOC for market saturation during the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Games. The cities were awash in corporations and merchants attempting to sell Olympic-related wares. The IOC {{indicated that they would}} address this to prevent spectacles of over-marketing at future Games. Another <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; the IOC incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols. The IOC also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income. Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games, even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments. Research has shown that trade is around 30 percent higher for countries that have hosted the Olympics.|$|E

5|$|That praises {{are without}} reason lavished on the dead, {{and that the}} honours due only to {{excellence}} are paid to antiquity, is a complaint likely to be always continued by those, who, being able to add nothing to truth, hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox; or those, who, being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients, are willing to hope from posterity what the present age refuses, and flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy, will be at last bestowed by time. Antiquity, like every other quality that attracts the notice of mankind, has undoubtedly votaries that reverence it, not from reason, but from prejudice. Some seem to admire indiscriminately whatever has been long preserved, without considering that time has sometimes co-operated with chance; all perhaps {{are more willing to}} honour past than present excellence; and the mind contemplates genius through the shades of age, as the eye surveys the sun through artificial opacity. The great contention of <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> to find the faults of the moderns, and the beauties of the ancients. While an authour is yet living we estimate his powers by his worst performance, and when he is dead we rate them by his best.|$|E

5000|$|... {{the form}} in which <b>criticisms</b> <b>are</b> {{delivered}} - effective or ineffective.|$|R
25|$|Those who deliver {{training}} must exemplify both military {{skills and}} cultural sensitivity. While one's own country might consider searching after-action reviews a recognized learning experience, such techniques are counterproductive {{in countries where}} even one-on-one direct <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> insulting, {{and even more so}} if <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> delivered in front of third parties. Especially in intelligence and psychological operations, the FID and HN personnel should recognize they can learn from one another.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> {{that general}} relativity {{may be an}} effective field theory, and therefore quantization ignores the fundamental degrees of freedom.|$|E
25|$|Palaeography is {{the study}} of ancient writing, and textual <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> the study of manuscripts in order to {{reconstruct}} a probable original text.|$|E

25|$|Another <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} D/L method {{does not account}} for changes in {{proportion}} of the innings for which field restrictions are in place compared to a completed match.|$|E
25|$|Lack {{of biblical}} basisâ€”According to apologists this <b>criticism</b> <b>is</b> no longer valid because Adventist {{scholars}} have produced an extensive {{treatment of the}} doctrine purely {{on the basis of}} Scripture alone.|$|E
