40|$|The {{ballistic}} {{performance of}} an ultra-high hardness armour steel (UHA) has been evaluated {{for a range}} of thicknesses and obliquities against armour piercing (AP) and fragment simulating projectiles (FSPs). Together with published literature, these results enable the effect of plate hardness on performance against both AP and FSP threats to be characterized over a range of plate hardnesses from ∼ 300 to 600 HB. For AP projectiles, a complex relationship was observed that corresponded well with historical phenomenological curves describing the effect of varying projectile and armour failure mechanisms. In the ultra-high hardness regime (> 570 HB), against AP projectiles with <b>core</b> <b>hardnesses</b> of 610 - 745 HB (i. e. 7. 62 mm APM 2 and 12. 7 mm APM 2 projectiles), projectile shatter was demonstrated to be the controlling mechanism of armour performance. Against much softer FSPs (281 HB), where projectile shatter is not a relevant mechanism, the armour performance was found to initially decrease with increasing plate hardness up to ∼ 450 HB due to increased susceptibility to adiabatic shear plugging. Above ∼ 450 HB the performance was observed to plateau. The observed performance plateau appears to relate to a critical threshold for adiabatic shear failure beyond which further increases in plate hardness will not result in a decrease in performance. A number of common empirical and analytical models were applied to reproduce the experimentally-determined relationship between hardness and penetration resistance, none of which were able to qualitatively or quantitatively reproduce the observed relationships for either projectile class...|$|R

For the simulation of a carburized layer, samples made of SAE 43 XX were employed, varying the content of carbon from 0. 20 to 1. 00 %. Specimens were copper layer electroplated, and then, they were heat treated in a cycle of carburizing, quenching, and tempering in five different temperatures to expose them to the thermal effects without diffusion of carbon. The results of the microhardness for the steels and for the analyzed conditions are presented in this work. The curve of microhardness has the same profile of a carburized layer for the SAE 4320 heat treated in the same conditions. The crack growth rates as a function of delta K for three tempering temperatures are plotted and the curves are shown. These results show that when the hardness is high (at 200  °C tempering temperature), there is a scattering of the curves and for the case of lower hardness (at 600  °C tempering temperature), the curves are closer. With increasing of tempering temperature there is a decreasing of the hardness and a significant effect of the metallurgical condition of the resistance of fatigue crack growth. Furthermore, with decreasing of the carbon content there is a very significant increase on the resistance of the fatigue crack growth.

Microstructural analysis and micro-hardness profile revealed that the shaft was improperly heat treated resulting in a brittle case, where crack was found to initiate from the case in a brittle mode in contrast to ductile mode within the core.

40|$|AbstractSteel alloys are the {{material}} that is most used in protective constructions today. The reason is the overall good properties of steels, with its high strength and hardness, high ductility, high formability and relatively low cost compared to other materials. Even though armour steels are affordable, work is done to limit expenses from production or {{come up with new}} and less expensive alloys. Case hardening is a technique for production of steel with a very hard and durable surface while still maintaining a tough and ductile core. Case hardened products have hard, durable and fatigue resistant surfaces and tough and durable cores. Case hardening is typically applied to machine parts that are exposed to heavy wear and high loads such as gears, bearings, screws and nuts, shafts, etc	In 2010, Lou et al. managed to significantly increase the penetration resistance of a low-cost steel (NVE 36) by case hardening. Encouraged by this, Hans Magne Thorseth wrote his master s thesis Optimalisering av stål i beskyttelseskonstruksjoner in 2010. His attempt to improve the ballistic strength of Hardox 450 steel by case hardening did not have the desired results. The ballistic limit velocity was reduced from approximately 800 m/s for the original Hardox 450 to approximately 770 m/s for the case hardened steel. The probable reasons for the reduction of the ballistic limit velocity was a too low carbon content increase from the carburizing and thus a too low hardness increase, in addition to deterioration of the metal core properties from the heat treatment. The objective of this master s thesis was to improve the case hardening process used by Hans Magne Thorseth in his master s thesis. The improvement work was divided into two parts, a preliminary project work and this master thesis. The project was carried out in the autumn of 2010, and the aim was to find the optimum case hardening process to produce steel with improved ballistic properties. This involved testing of different carburizing potentials to increase the surface carbon content of the metal and to find carburizing heat treatments that would retain the core properties of the carburized steel. Based on the results from the preliminary project it seemed possible to produce case hardened steel with surface hardness over 1000 HV, but a slight reduction of <b>core</b> <b>hardness</b> was difficult to avoid. The present master s thesis was written during the spring of 2011. The key results from the preliminary project work were used to determine a range of case hardening courses. A total of 11 case hardening courses were tested, of which six courses employed carbon potential of 0. 9 % and five courses employed a carbon potential of 1. 1 %. Different hardening courses were tested, including direct hardening, a modified single hardening process and traditional and modified versions of double and triple hardening. Before the case hardening the plates were sandblasted to remove a corrosion-resistant primer that was applied to the plates. The primer was believed to limit the diffusion of carbon into the steel. In the preliminary project the primer was ground away and grinding was the preferred solution in this work as well, however, due to capacity issues sandblasting was employed. The ballistic limit velocity of the case hardened and the original Hardox 450 target plates were calculated from results obtained by ballistic experiments. The ballistic limit velocities of the case hardened samples, with approximately 787 m/s as the highest, were lower than that of the original Hardox 450, being approximately 800 m/s. 	Surface hardness measurements of the steel revealed a poor effect from the carburization, the hardest surface was measured at 735 HV. This could be explained by a probable surface decarburization of the original Hardox 450, which was discovered by microstructure examinations and hardness measurements. In contrary to in the preliminary project where this layer was ground away, the sandblasting did not remove the decarburized layer. Due to this, the case hardening did not have the desired effect on the steel surface, resulting in a too low surface hardness. 	The <b>core</b> <b>hardness</b> proved difficult to retain, the highest <b>core</b> <b>hardness</b> value obtained was below 460 HV, compared to the original Hardox 450 with <b>core</b> <b>hardness</b> of 475 HV. This could be another reason for the lower ballistic limit velocity of the carburized steel plates. However, the original Hardox 450 did not have the highest cross-sectional hardness integral value, so the ballistic properties probably also depend to some degree on ductility. A main reason for the superior ballistic limit velocity of the original Hardox 450 was therefore believed to be related to cracking of the rear side of the case hardened target plates during projectile penetration. The cracking seemed to be a result of the harder, and thus more brittle, outer surface layer...|$|E

After carburization process, the test samples were subjected to the standard test and from the data obtained, ultimate tensile strength, engineering strain, impact strength, Youngs ’ moduli were calculated. The case and <b>core</b> <b>hardness</b> of the carburized tempered samples were measured. It was observed that the mechanical properties of mild steels {{were found to be}} strongly influenced by the process of carburization, carburizing temperature and soaking time at carburizing temperature. It was concluded that the sample carburized at 900 °C soaked for 15 minutes and the one carburized at 850 °C soaked for 30 minutes followed by oil quenching and tempering at 550 °C were better because they showed a trend of hard case with softer core...|$|E
40|$|In retail, {{assortment}} planning {{refers to}} selecting {{a subset of}} products to offer that maximizes profit. Assortments can be planned for a single store or a retailer with multiple chain stores where demand varies between stores. In this paper, we assume that a retailer with a multitude of stores wants to specify her offered assortment. To suit all local preferences, regionalization and store-level assortment optimization are widely used in practice and lead to competitive advantages. When selecting regionalized assortments, a tradeoff between expensive, customized assortments in every store and inexpensive, identical assortments in all stores that neglect demand variation is preferable. We formulate a stylized model for the regionalized assortment planning problem (APP) with capacity constraints and given demand. In our approach, a 'common assortment' that is supplemented by regionalized products is selected. While products in the common assortment are offered in all stores, products in the local assortments are customized and vary from store to store. Concerning the computational complexity, we show that the APP is strongly NP-complete. The <b>core</b> of this <b>hardness</b> result lies {{in the selection of}} the common assortment. We formulate the APP as an integer program and provide algorithms and methods for obtaining approximate solutions and solving large-scale instances. Lastly, we perform computational experiments to analyze the benefits of regionalized assortment planning depending on the variation in customer demands between stores...|$|R
40|$|Goal: The {{goal of this}} {{monograph}} is {{development of}} the tool materials being {{the outcome of the}} concept of merging the surface engineering as the domain of knowledge with technology which is the powder metallurgy. The result are the fabricated materials with the gradient, high-speed steels matrix composites (HSSMC) surface layers on steel substrate, combining the mutually exclusive mechanical properties like the high surface hardness and ductility of a tool. Project/methodology/approach: Modern powder forming technologies were used for fabrication of the developed tool materials, e. g., powder injection moulding, pressureless forming, and classic compacting. Sintering was carried out in the vacuum or protective atmosphere conditions, which makes direct material hardening possible from the sintering temperature. Testing of mechanical properties encompassed hardness testing, bending strength testing, and determining the abrasion wear resistance. Detailed structural examinations were carried out to determine the effect of temperature and atmosphere during sintering on type and size of the carbide- and carbonitride precipitations. Moreover, retained austenite portion was determined after hardening and tempering. Achievements: The original achievement is development of the method of the polymer-powder slurry moulding for fabrication of coatings which, because of the binding agent degradation and sintering, form the homogeneous or gradient HSSMC surface layers on the steel substrate - completed or fabricated in the same technological process. Tool materials fabricated with this method are characteristic of high ductility of the steel <b>core</b> and high <b>hardness</b> of the surface layer. Limitations of research/applications: The assumption of the powder injection moulding technique is forming of the small elements with complex shapes and, therefore, this technology is not designed for fabrication of tools with the big overall dimensions. In case of the pressureless forming of the surface layers from HSSMC on the steel core or in case of regeneration of the tool worn out, the limitations come only from the heating device chamber size and the necessity to heat up the entire treated element. Practical applications: It is anticipated that the worked out and fabricated tool materials of the new generation will fill a gap in respect of the mechanical properties between the relatively ductile high-speed steels and the brittle sintered carbides. The newly developed method may be used in the mass- or piece production conditions making, e. g., regeneration possible of the costly tools’ surfaces. Originality/value: Employment of the modern powders forming techniques, and especially of the pressureless forming and sintering in the flowing nitrogen-hydrogen mixture atmosphere, makes it possible to fabricate tool materials with the layered or gradient structure with the multidirectional growing portion of the hard carbide- or carbonitride phases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Nowadays, high {{strength}} steels are getting very popular {{all over the}} world for various applications such as in auto body making, machine parts manufacturing, steel structure buildings, concrete reinforcement, etc. In Bangladesh, use of {{high strength}} TMT steels bars has got a momentum in the construction of flyovers, bridges and high rise buildings because of its good combination of the required mechanical properties. In this research work, locally produced high strength TMT reinforcing steel bars (20 mm dia.) of two different companies have been investigated. As a part of this research work, at first, details microstructural morphologies of hardened case, transition zone and core of both steels were investigated by optical microscope and they were then photographed. After that, Rockwell hardness was measured on different zones. Tensile tests were also carried by a Universal Testing Machine at room temperature. After tensile tests, details of the fracture modes of the steel bars were studied carefully. The fracture modes were then discussed in terms of chemical compositions and carbon equivalents, resulted microstructures, case and <b>core</b> <b>hardness,</b> depths of hardened case and transition zone of the steel bars...|$|E
