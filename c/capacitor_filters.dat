40|$|Design of {{switched}} capacitor circuits in scaled CMOS technologies is becoming {{difficult because of}} low device intrinsic gain and reduced power supply voltage. To solve these problems, comparator-based switched-capacitor (CBSC) circuits and zero-crossing based circuits (ZCBC) were suggested as a possible solution to the op-amp based circuits. In this thesis, we explore zero-crossing based circuits (ZCBC) in high-order differential switched-capacitor filters to replace area inefficient op-amps-based continuous-time baseband filters. For the prototype for the zero-crossing based high-order switched <b>capacitor</b> <b>filter,</b> a low-pass ladder filter network will be used which is less sensitive to component variations. Several transformation steps from this low-pass passive ladder filter network to a differential high-order switched <b>capacitor</b> <b>filter</b> will be explored. To verify this architecture, SWITCAP will be used. And then ZCBC circuit implementation in Cadence will be explored. by Sungah Lee. Thesis (S. M.)
