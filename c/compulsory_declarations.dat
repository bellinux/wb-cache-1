40|$|One of the {{characteristic}} functions of modern {{government is to}} administer declarations of attachment. Many of these declarations are compulsory, and they span a wide range. In order to receive some social benefit-a license, citizenship, education, employment, a right to cohabit-one must declare one 2 ̆ 7 s allegiance to a person or entity. Declarations of attachment are often backed {{by the force of}} law. Membership in private organizations, including fraternities, religious groups, and clubs, may also be conditioned on compliance with requirements of this sort. Compulsory oaths have been a prominent source of controversy {{in the latter half of}} the twentieth century. Consider, for example, recent debates over the pledge of allegiance, loyalty oaths, the marriage vow, and oaths of citizenship for new Americans. Civil libertarians have criticized <b>compulsory</b> <b>declarations</b> in some or all of these settings on the ground that they impose requirements of uniformity and obedience that are inconsistent with important principles of pluralism and individual freedom. Defenders of <b>compulsory</b> <b>declarations</b> respond that oaths serve important unifying, educative, and even celebratory functions, inculcating in participants a sense of the solemnity and importance of such central institutions as citizenship and marriage. In this view, otherwise plausible principles of freedom and pluralism should not be permitted to override the legitimate functions performed by compulsory oaths. Indeed, freedom and pluralism may ultimately depend on the social cohesion brought about by institutions that perform precisely those functions. My goal in this essay is to explore the diverse social functions of <b>compulsory</b> <b>declarations</b> of attachment. The treatment will be tentative and speculative; it will also be largely descriptive rather than normative. I want to provide some preliminary answers to the following questions: What social tasks do <b>compulsory</b> <b>declarations</b> carry out? To what problems and needs, and to whose problems and needs, are they an attempted response...|$|E
40|$|The {{lack of a}} long term, {{comprehensive}} and reliable fisheries statistics system is a major impediment to fisheries management in Brazil. Fishing {{is one of the}} main activities throughout the country's coast, with predominance of small-scale, artisanal, multigear, and multispecies captures that are landed in a pulverized network of coastal villages. Brazil is also a hotspot of common names, another feature that challenges artisanal fisheries' monitoring. We combined taxonomic and ethnobiological information to support the implementation of an artisanal fisheries' monitoring program under the co-management framework of a Marine Extractive Reserve in Bahia State, Northeastern Brazil. We surveyed 141 fishing landings, recording 86 fish species (43 families) and 52 correspondences 1 : 1 between local and scientific names. Broad folk categories had an average of 5. 1 specific names, with "cação" (shark) being the category with more specific names (24 names to six biological species). With the exception of species that make up the bycatch captured by shrimp trawling, fisherfolks are able to identify commercially important species from both fresh specimens and photos. Common names can be reliably used in fisheries monitoring programs, and their usage facilitates the participation of fisherfolks in surveys based on voluntary or <b>compulsory</b> <b>declarations</b> of capture...|$|E

30|$|A list of {{notifiable}} diseases {{has been}} established by WHO, and countries have adopted for healthcare providers (treating physicians, diagnostic laboratories, hospitals, street-based mobile units) a <b>compulsory</b> <b>declaration</b> of various infectious diseases (single cases or outbreaks) that may constitute public health emergencies. 3 As an example of current developments in this field, Denmark has recently set up a nationwide Danish Microbiology Database in order to enable real-time surveillance of communicable diseases and microorganisms (Voldstedlund, Haarh, Mølbak and MiBa Board of Representatives 2014).|$|R

40|$|The Belgian scholar Ernest Nys (1851 - 1920), a {{big name}} in public {{international}} law and legal history, is mainly known for his extensive publications in the Revue de droit international et de législation comparée, often focusing on medieval and early modern doctrine. Yet, Nys was active as a judge and an ad hoc legal adviser, combining his abilities as a traditional continental law-jurist and a legal historian. During World War One, he drafted an impressive manifesto against wartime contributions on movable property designed by the German Occupant. The text combines an intellectual pedigree of political thought with strict legal reasoning {{on the basis of}} classics, such as the 1874 Brussels Conference or the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions. Finally, Nys’ motivations for an assault on this capital tax, which included a <b>compulsory</b> <b>declaration</b> of personal wealth, can be situated in traditional liberal resistance against state intrusion into the private sphere...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to analyze underreporting of tuberculosis cases from the capture of deaths registered at the Mortality Information System (SIM) from 2007 to 2011. We conducted a retrospective study in a city at the Northeast region of Brazil using a non-probabilistic association technique between SIM registries and the Information System on Diseases of <b>Compulsory</b> <b>Declaration</b> (Sinan), through the software Reclink III. We calculated odds ratios (OR) of individuals who died from tuberculosis not reported at Sinan, according sociodemographic characteristics. From 147 deaths registered at SIM, 72. 8 % were not notified at Sinan. Women {{were more likely to}} not be reported than men (OR = 2. 60), people younger than 60 years (OR = 1. 86), with less than eight years of education (OR = 4. 42). Strategies should be re-signified in a way to capture more respiratory symptoms, to opportunely diagnose cases and to avoid flaws when completing registries...|$|R

The study had as objective to perform an epidemiological and operational assessment of Hansen’s disease in the municipality of Cariré – Ceará, from an epidemiological, descriptive and temporal survey, with the notified cases in the period from January 1 st 2001 to December 31 st 2010, from the Information System on Diseases of <b>Compulsory</b> <b>Declaration</b> (Sistema de Informação de Agravos de Notificação - SINAN) database at Cariré’s Municipal Health Secretariat, with 116 cases residing in the municipality. It has been observed {{that in recent years}} there has been {{an increase in the number}} of new cases of Hansen’s disease, the incident rate and the prevalence coefficient, especially in the year 2010, due to greater active demand, improvement in diagnosis capacity and close contact assessment. Such findings are important, if we consider the presence of the hidden endemic. Therefore, requiring the monitoring of rates over time...|$|R
40|$|Being {{distant from}} Brazil’s great natural diversity, from its long {{tradition}} {{in the study of}} snakebites and {{from the fact that it}} is one of the few countries which has a national information system for monitoring incidents involving venomous animals, non-Brazilian researchers face risks when estimating the incidence of these accidents in the country. The present work offers a critical review of the main estimates undertaken since 1954. It is interesting to note contradictions between textual and graphic information within the same article, variations over time in the work of a same researcher and differences among distinct authors, and that all these issues remain unmentioned or undiscussed. Comparison among such estimates and the data available at the Brazilian Information System on Diseases of <b>Compulsory</b> <b>Declaration</b> (Sistema de Informação de Agravos de Notificação – SINAN) creates an opportunity to identify the degree of imprecision present in those articles, and draws attention to the need for the production of studies at both the regional and national levels, based on concrete data collected at national, state and municipal levels, which has been available on the internet since 2001...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{burden of}} {{traumatic}} and elective hip surgery {{is set to}} grow. With {{an increasing number of}} techniques and implants against the background of an aging population, the emphasis on evidence-based treatment has never been greater. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess changes in the levels of evidence in the hip literature over a decade. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles pertaining to hip surgery from the years 2000 and 2010 in Hip International, Journal of Arthroplasty, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery and The Bone and Joint Journal were analysed. Articles were ranked by a five-point level of evidence scale and by type of study, according to guidelines from the Centre for Evidence-based Medicine. RESULTS: 531 articles were analysed from 48 countries. The kappa value for the inter-observer reliability showed excellent agreement between the reviewers for study type (κ =  0. 956, P <  0. 01) and for levels of evidence (κ =  0. 772, P <  0. 01). Between 2000 and 2010, the overall percentage of high-level evidence (levels I and II) studies more than doubled (12 to 31  %, P <  0. 001). The most frequent study type was therapeutic; the USA and UK were the largest producers of published work in these journals, with contributions from other countries increasing markedly over the decade. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a significant increase in high levels of evidence in hip surgery over a decade (P <  0. 001). We recommend that all orthopaedic journals consider implementing <b>compulsory</b> <b>declaration</b> by authors of the level of evidence to help enhance quality of evidence.

40|$|Snake bite {{incidents}} are on rise in Brazil. The present study updates {{the current state}} of knowledge about snake poisoning in Brazil, following a descriptive and retrospective method. The study is based on the information on 329, 180 cases registered at the Brazilian Information System on Diseases of <b>Compulsory</b> <b>Declaration</b> (Sistema de Informação de Agravos de Notificação - SINAN), for a period of 12 years starting from 2001 to 2012. The variables selected were spatial (Brazilian state) and temporal (month and year). Factors like poisoning due to genus of snake, time elapsed between the poisoning and the first emergency treatment, the age and the sex of the victim, seriousness and evolution of the poisoning etc are crucial elements that {{play a role in the}} recovery process. Poisoning incidents based on the relative risks (RR) in terms of age group for all geographic regions of the country were calculated using the Northern region as an index. The study observed an annual increase in the number of cases with seasonal variations. It exhibited a sizeable difference between the minimum and maximum monthly rates of incidents throughout the study period. As per the study, the highest number of cases occurred in the state of Pará with the greatest number of cases (5, 317). The state of Tocantins witnessed the highest incidence (79. 4 / 100, 000 inhabitants) and the percentage of affected children and adolescents between 10 and 19 years of age are high in the North region (23. 2 %; CI 95 %= 22. 9 - 23. 4 %). Seasonal, regional and local factors must be taken into account when training the teams responsible for treating victims and in the planning of the production and distribution of stocks of antivenom serum...|$|R
40|$|Patenting new {{products}} in pharmaceuticals industry is of greater importance {{than in the}} other high technology branches of industry nowadays. Concentration of manufacturing takes place in pharmaceuticals industry {{as well as in}} the other branches of industry and it is characterised by the joining of firms. However, there are several specific features in patenting pharmaceutical products. Enforcement of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) made it compulsory to establish in all World Trade Organization (WTO) Members patent protection on pharmaceutical products and their manufacturing methods as well as patent protection of drugs. WTO Doha Declaration is an essential stage in patent protection of pharmaceutical products establishing the legal basis and compulsory licensing system. In 2005, the European Commission completed the Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on compulsory licensing of patents relating to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products for export to countries with public health problems. patent protection of pharmaceutical products, the TRIPS Agreement, the Doha <b>Declaration,</b> <b>compulsory</b> license, exclusive right, global economy...|$|R
