Their dyeing performances as reactive dyes have been assessed on silk, wool and cotton fabrics. These dyes were characterized by UV–Vis, FTIR, 1 H NMR spectroscopic techniques elemental analysis. The percentage dye bath exhaustion and fixation on different fibers {{were found to be}} very good. The dyed fabric showed moderate to very good light fastness and good to excellent washing and rubbing fastness properties. Spectral properties and colorimetric data (L∗, a∗, b∗, C∗, H∗, K/S) have also been studied in detail...|$|E
40|$|Hot {{branding}} {{has been}} used for many years by researchers to identify seals from a long distance. In livestock, <b>cold</b> <b>branding</b> has been proposed as an alternative because it is thought to be less painful. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the healing process of hot and <b>cold</b> <b>brands</b> applied to harbour seal pups (Phoca vitulina). A total of 306 animals was branded with a unique set of four characters: three applied for 3 - 5 s with an iron heated to 500 degrees C, and one applied for either 10 or 20 s with an iron frozen to - 175 degrees C. At three subsequent times over 10 weeks, 43, 41 and 51 animals, respectively, were recaptured, the macroscopic appearance of their brands recorded, and biopsies taken for microscopic examination. <b>Cold</b> <b>brands</b> had a faster healing rate than hot brands. However, they resulted in less destruction of hair follicles, and <b>cold</b> <b>brands</b> applied for 20 s caused more depigmentation. Regrowth of hair follicles could subsequently obscure brands, while depigmentation reduces the contrast between the brand and the surrounding fur. <b>Cold</b> <b>brands</b> applied for 20 s also caused more extensive deep vascular damage, which subsequently may have resulted in deeper wounds in some of these brands. Yet, macroscopically, other <b>cold</b> <b>brands,</b> or portions thereof, were almost invisible. On the basis of this short-term study, the technique of <b>cold</b> <b>branding</b> that we used in harbour seals does not appear to be as reliable as that of hot branding to provide permanent legible brands. ...|$|R
5000|$|In the 18th century, <b>cold</b> <b>branding</b> or <b>branding</b> with <b>cold</b> irons {{became the}} mode of {{nominally}} inflicting the punishment on prisoners of higher rank. [...] "When Charles Moritz, a young German, visited England in 1782 he was much surprised at this custom, and in his diary mentioned {{the case of a}} clergyman who had fought a duel and killed his man in Hyde Park.

5000|$|Human {{branding}} or stigmatizing is {{the process}} which a mark, usually a symbol or ornamental pattern, is burned into {{the skin of a}} living person, with the intention that the resulting scar makes it permanent. This is performed using a hot or very <b>cold</b> <b>branding</b> iron. It therefore uses the physical techniques of livestock branding on a human, either with consent as a form of body modification; or under coercion, as a punishment or to identify an enslaved or otherwise oppressed person. It may also be practiced as a [...] "rite of passage", e.g. within a tribe, or to signify membership of or acceptance into an organization.|$|R

A registration process was initiated in 2009, {{when it was announced}} that the Marwari Horse Society had become a government body, the only government-authorized registration society for Marwari horses. The registration process includes an evaluation of the horse against the breed standards, during which unique identification marks and physical dimensions are recorded. After the evaluation, the horse is <b>cold</b> <b>branded</b> with its registration number and photographed. In late 2009 the Indian government announced that the Marwari horse, along with other Indian horse breeds, would be commemorated on a set of stamps issued by that country.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —We {{evaluated}} survivorship, tag retention, {{and growth}} of juvenile walleyes Stizostedion vitreum hand-tagged with binary-coded wire micro tags (BCWMTs) or cold-branded with liquid nitrogen. A single BCWMT could be injected via the hand-tagging technique every 5 - 10 s and tagging with BCWMTs was superior to cold-branding. Fish with dorsally injected BCWMTs had significantly greater mean survival than the caudally injected group but not greater survival than the cold-branded group. There was no difference (P> 0. 05) in survival among {{any of the three}} control groups. Microtags were retained equally well in dorsal and caudal locations, and significantly better than <b>cold</b> <b>brands.</b> Fish grew significantly in standard length during the 66 -d evaluation period (P < 0. 05) and increased (though not significantly) in wet weight. Treatment and control groups were not significantly different in attained size, suggesting no differential growth depression due to marking method or location. Fishery biologists have developed numerous ways to mark fish for studies of migration, mor-tality, growth, habitat use, and other aspects of life history (Wydoski and Emery 1983; Parker et al. 1990). One marking technique that does not mu-tilate fish or affect their behavior and growth is injection of binary-coded wire microtags (BCWMTs), which were first described by Jefferts etal. (1963). Coded wire microtags (1 -mm-long x 0. 25 -mm-diameter stainless steel wires) have been used suc-cessfully in many fish studies, although there have been mixed results in terms of survival and tag retention. For example, when BCWMTs were used on anchovies Stolephorus purpureus smaller than 57 mm (standard length), mean survival was 80. 5 % and tag retention was 85. 3 % (Leary and Murph...|$|R

5000|$|Chameleon Cold-Brew {{was founded}} in 2010 by Steve Williams and Chris Campbell. [...] Williams, a {{longtime}} coffee industry professional and coffee shop owner, created a unique blend of cold brew coffee to sell exclusively at his east Austin coffeehouse, Bennu Coffee.  Campbell, who holds an MBA from Rice University, {{was working as a}} business consultant when he and Williams met at a neighborhood barbecue. The pair decided to join forces, utilizing Campbell’s entrepreneurial ambitions and Williams’ coffee expertise, to bottle and sell a <b>cold</b> brew <b>brand</b> based off the original recipe served at Bennu Coffee. [...] The pair teamed with Austin coffee icon and master roaster, R.C. Beall, to perfect the cold brew blend using beans from Beall’s coffee sourcing company, Texas Coffee Traders. After months of experimenting with various brewing methods, beans and water sources, the recipe was finalized and Chameleon Cold-Brew debuted its first products in the Austin market in 2011 at a south Austin convenient store, The Whip In. [...] The original cold brew recipe is still freshly brewed and served at Bennu Coffee’s two Austin locations.|$|R

30|$|From {{a retail}} perspective, {{packaging}} {{was identified as}} an important tool to prevent waste and save resources, offering product protection and adequate shelf life. Easy handling, both in the store and in the sorting process for recovery, was emphasized and a good presentation of the product is a central feature of good consumer and retail packaging. Retailers felt a need to improve the packaging skill level and packaging standards especially for their own <b>brands.</b> <b>Cold</b> chains are sometimes used for products which do not require cold preservation. Aseptic packaging in ambient temperatures is sometimes an alternative to energy consuming refrigerated units. The retail related findings {{are in line with}} earlier results [34] but more emphasis is here placed on packaging to prevent food waste throughout the value chain as studied in more depth by several authors [see e.g. 30, 35].|$|R
