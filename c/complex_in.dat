40|$|Terminal {{propargylic}} compounds containing an alkyne {{unit and}} an alcohol or ester {{group in the}} propargylic position have a fairly acidic acetylenic hydrogen atom; this makes them versatile substrates for further chemical transformation. Some transition metals such as ruthenium or copper exhibit specific affinity for terminal propargylic compounds, generating dielectrophilic ruthenium- or copper-allenylidene complexes that show high potential for stereoselective cycloaddition with various bis-nucleophiles. In this review, we highlight this emerging field of catalytic stereoselective cycloaddition with terminal propargylic compounds. Examples of ruthenium-, copper-, palladium-, and gold-catalyzed cycloaddition are given in the article, along with mechanistic considerations. 1 Introduction 2 Ruthenium-Allenylidene <b>Complexes</b> <b>in</b> Enantioselective Cycloaddition 3 Copper-Allenylidene <b>Complexes</b> <b>in</b> Enantioselective Cycloaddition 4 Palladium-Propargyl <b>Complexes</b> <b>in</b> Stereoselective Cycloaddition 5 Gold-Carbenoid <b>Complexes</b> <b>in</b> Stereoselective Cycloaddition 6 Summary and Outloo...|$|R

5|$|Apart {{from these}} two tightly bound protein subunits, many {{proteins}} interact with the exosome <b>complex</b> <b>in</b> both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells. These loosely associated proteins may regulate the activity and specificity of the exosome <b>complex.</b> <b>In</b> the cytoplasm, the exosome interacts with AU rich element (ARE) binding proteins (e.g. KRSP and TTP), which can promote or prevent degradation of mRNAs. The nuclear exosome associates with RNA binding proteins (e.g. MPP6/Mpp6 and C1D/Rrp47 in humans/yeast) that are required for processing certain substrates.|$|E

Fitting results show that both χeffc and σ of PS and PMMA increase as the formation of lithium−PMMA <b>complexes</b> <b>in</b> PS-b-PMMA copolymers, and the degree of such increase depends on the concentration of lithium−PMMA <b>complexes.</b> <b>In</b> addition, χeffc of the lithium-complexed PS-b-PMMA becomes less temperature-dependent due to the increase in χs and decrease in χH...|$|R
