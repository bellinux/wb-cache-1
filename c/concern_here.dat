25|$|Certain {{authors have}} prostitutes talking about themselves: Lucian in his Dialogue of courtesans or Alciphron in his {{collection}} of letters; but these are works of fiction. The prostitutes of <b>concern</b> <b>here</b> are either independent or hetaera: the sources here do not concern themselves with the situation of slave-prostitutes, except to consider them {{as a source of}} profit. It is quite clear what ancient Greek men thought of prostitutes: primarily, they are reproached for the commercial nature of the activity. The greed of prostitutes is a running theme in Greek comedy. The fact that prostitutes were the only Athenian women who handled money likely increased male acrimony. An explanation for their behavior is that a prostitute's career tended to be short, and their income decreased with the passage of time: a young and pretty prostitute, across all levels of the trade, could earn more money than her older, less attractive colleagues. To provide for old age, they thus had to acquire as much money as possible in a limited period of time.|$|E

2500|$|The Institute {{made major}} {{contributions}} in two areas {{relating to the}} possibility of human subjects to be rational, i.e., individuals who could act rationally to take charge of their own society and their own history. The first consisted of social phenomena previously considered in Marxism as part of the [...] "superstructure" [...] or as ideology: personality, family and authority structures (one of the earliest works published bore the title Studies of Authority and the Family), and the realm of aesthetics and mass culture. Studies saw a common <b>concern</b> <b>here</b> in the ability of capitalism to destroy the preconditions of critical, revolutionary political consciousness. This meant arriving at a sophisticated awareness of the depth dimension in which social oppression sustains itself. It also meant the beginning of critical theory's recognition of ideology as part of the foundations of social structure.|$|E

2500|$|The Sarvastivadins saw dharmas as the {{ultimately}} 'real entities' (sad-dravya), {{though they}} also held that dharmas were dependently originated. For the Sarvastivadins, {{a synonym for}} svabhava is avayaya (a 'part'), the smallest possible unit which cannot be analyzed into smaller parts and hence it is ultimately real as opposed to only conventionally real (such as a chariot or a person). However, the Sarvastivadins did not hold that dharmas were completely independent of each other, as the Mahavibhasa states: [...] "conditioned dharmas are weak in their intrinsic nature, they can accomplish their activities only through mutual dependence" [...] and [...] "they have no sovereignty (aisvarya). They are dependent on others." [...] Svabhava in the early Abhidhamma texts was then not a term which meant ontological independence, metaphysical essence or underlying substance, but simply referred to their characteristics, which are dependent on other conditions and qualities. According to Ronkin: [...] "In the early Sarvāstivāda exegetical texts, then, svabhāva is used as an atemporal, invariable criterion determining what a dharma is, not necessarily that a dharma exists. The <b>concern</b> <b>here</b> is primarily with what makes categorial types of dharma unique, rather than with the ontological status of dharmas." [...] However, in the later Sarvastivada texts, like the Mahavibhasa, the term svabhava began to be defined more ontologically as the really existing “intrinsic nature” specifying individual dharmas.|$|E
