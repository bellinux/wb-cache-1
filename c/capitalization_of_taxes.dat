40|$|To {{the extent}} that impact fee {{financing}} of infrastructure replaces the property tax, it shifts payment from owners of existing property to parties associated with newly developing property. Rapid growth in a community is often cited as justification for this shift. A model of intergenerational equity is proposed based on benefit principle taxation and <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> costs and infrastructure benefits. The study concludes that rapid growth per se need not burden existing property owners unfairly. Unanticipated rapid growth, on the other hand, can lead to excess tax burdens on existing residents that may appropriately be mitigated through impact fees. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>capitalization</b> effect <b>of</b> {{property}} <b>tax</b> differentials for {{the four}} market quarters in 1976 was studied in the Logan, Utah market area. A secondary aspect {{of the study was}} to assess the variations in the assessed to market value ratio. 107 observed sales were used for the data set.

From the regression analysis it was found that there was a significant <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> differentials.

40|$|In an {{environment}} of increasing government expenditures financed largely viii through taxes, including a relatively visible and large residential property <b>tax,</b> the issue <b>of</b> whether property <b>taxes</b> are capitalized into market values is increasingly important. Property tax capitalization is the reflection <b>of</b> property <b>taxes</b> {{in the value of}} real property. The <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> property <b>tax</b> does not necessarily pose a problem; rather, problems arise when homes identical to each other have different taxes and these differentials are then capitalized into market values. These capitalized tax differentials result in large capital gains and losses to owners of real estate. This study (1) reviews existing economic theory and empirical evidence on the <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> property <b>taxes,</b> (2) develops a model of property valuation inclusive <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> effects, and (3) estimates the parameters of this model using a comprehensive data set of over 334 home sales in the Logan, Utah area. The empirical results include an estimate <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> <b>capitalization</b> effect. Two closely related issues are also addressed in the study. They include: (I) changes in real estate prices, including a suggested method for measuring such change and (2) a study <b>of</b> property <b>tax</b> equity, including two specific measures <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> fairness. The conclusions are (I) tax differentials are capitalized; (2) real estate prices in the study area increased approximately 10 percent per year from 1989 to 1992; and (3) there is significant variation in assessment ratios...|$|R

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} on the information content of the method of payment in mergers by examining shareholder returns {{in a sample of}} REIT mergers over the period 1994 - 1998. When the target firm is publicly held, we find that transactions are always stock-financed, and that acquiring firm shareholders sustain small negative returns around the announcement date. When the target is privately held, cash financing, mixed (stock and cash) financing, and placement of blocks of acquirer stock with target owners are more prevalent. Acquirer returns are positive in stock-financed mergers when the target is private, which is consistent with both the information signaling and monitoring by blockholders hypotheses. Further analysis supports the information signaling hypothesis as the dominant explanation. The effects of other explanatory variables are similar whether the target is public or private. Most significantly, acquiring shareholder returns are negatively related to the acquirer's size, but positively related to the acquirer's use of the UPREIT organizational structure. The positive wealth effects of the UPREIT structure are not fully explained as the <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> benefits.

40|$|We {{examine whether}} the Michigan school funding reform of 1994 had general {{equilibrium}} {{effects in the}} Detroit metropolitan area. The reform had two components: centralization of school funding at the state level, with increases for low-revenue districts and revenue caps for highrevenue districts, and property tax reduction. We present a stylized equilibrium model whose main insight is that since the revenue component of the policy did not alter the preexisting ordering of districts by revenue, {{the main effect of}} the reform will be the <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> lower property <b>taxes</b> and revenue changes with a possible increase in school quality in some districts yet no household relocation. In addition, we study the effects of the change in the metropolitan area’s income distribution between 1990 and 2000, which favored low-income households proportionally the most. The combination of the model’s predictions for the tax-revenue reform and the changes in the income distribution implies that the observed housing appreciation can be decomposed into the <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> lower <b>taxes</b> and revenue changes, a general appreciation term, and an appreciation pattern related to changes in the income variance. We find that these theoretical predictions are supported by the data. Other implications of the model are also supported by the empirical evidence. 1 Ferreyra thanks the Berkman Faculty Development Fund at Carnegie Mellon University for financial support.

40|$|Across {{different}} {{layers of the}} U. S. government there are surprisingly large differences in institutional provisions that impose fiscal discipline, such as constitutionally mandated deficit or debt limits, or specific tax bases. In this paper we develop a framework {{that can be used}} to quantitatively assess their costs and benefits. The model features both endogenous and exogenous mobility across jurisdictions, so we can evaluate whether the different degree of mobility at the local vs. national level can justify different institutional restrictions. In preliminary results, we show that pure land taxes have very beneficial incentive effects, but can only raise limited amounts of revenues. In contrast, under exogenous mobility, income taxes lead unambiguously to insufficient incentives to invest in public capital, unless the fiscal constraints explicitly favor such investment. This conclusion seems to hold even with the introduction of endogenous mobility, since adverse congestion effects from inefficient migration offset the beneficial impact <b>of</b> (partial) <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> future <b>taxes</b> into land prices.

40|$|Two views {{dominate}} {{the debate about}} property tax incidence — the “capital tax” or “new” view, under which the tax distorts capital allocation and is borne primarily by capital owners, and the “benefit tax” view, under which the tax is an efficient user charge. Evidence of both interjurisdictional and intrajurisdictional <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> property <b>taxes</b> and public services has been argued to provide compelling evidence for the benefit tax view. This paper focuses on the latter — the intra-jurisdictional capitalization effects that underlie what {{is arguably the most}} plausible derivation <b>of</b> the benefit <b>tax</b> view <b>of</b> the property <b>tax.</b> The analysis provides a model in which the capital reallocations that characterize the capital tax view induce intrajurisdictional capitalization effects that are generally similar — indeed, in the benchmark case, identical — to those that arise under the benefit tax view, suggesting that empirical evidence supporting such capitalization effects cannot distinguish between the two views. In addition, the analysis shows that these capitalization effects imply that even under the stringent assumptions of the benefit view, the property tax is not a benefit tax for a property-tax-financed increase in local public services; rather, it only becomes a benefit tax for future home purchasers — after the modeled intrajurisdictional capitalization effects occur...|$|R

A major weakness in this literatureis the neglect of voting, the other principal method of preference revelation for local public services. This article seeks to integrate {{the analysis of the}} outcomes of voting and mobility decisions by linking a model of residential property value determination and a public choice model of local public expenditure determination. <b>Capitalization</b> <b>of</b> fiscal differentials is shown to affect voting decisions through the <b>tax</b> price <b>of</b> local services.

The impact <b>of</b> housing <b>tax</b> policies differs depending upon {{the extent to which the}} subsidy is capitalized into city land prices and whether a land use constraint such as suburban large lot zoning exists to make poorer households less mobile. If the rich and poor both are fully mobile, increasing a subsidy to home ownership that is positively correlated with the income of the owner leads to the decentralization of both rich and poor; the greater the extent <b>of</b> <b>capitalization,</b> the larger the decentralization impact.

Thus, it is only when the mobility of the poor is restricted that housing <b>tax</b> policy <b>of</b> the type we have in the U.

Finally, it is noteworthy that our analysis of community choice is not driven by different preferences for city or suburb that may be associated with the income elasticity of housing demand.
