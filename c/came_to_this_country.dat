He has acquired a correct knowledge of their manner of living, and speaks their language fluently. He has rose (sic?) to be quite a considerable character, or chief, in their village; at least he assumes all the dignities of a chief, for he has four wives, with whom he lives alternately.|$|E

[...] Tito Puente praised the film prior to its {{theatrical}} release, stating, [...] "I've seen the movie twice, and I loved it the second time. The first time I couldn't get into it.

[...] He owned {{most of the land}} in the section of the city where St. Clement’s now stands, and his interest was directed {{to the development of a}} residential area by building row houses on Arch, Race and Twentieth Streets. He was eager that a church should be built, not so much because of any religious devotion on his part, but because he felt the erection of a church would greatly enhance the attractiveness of his residential projects.|$|E

[...] Therefore all this talk of beautifying New York seems strange to me. If we were discussing Bismarck I might ask five hundred questions about him before I should think of asking whether he was beautiful. ... So it is with New York. We expect of her power and magnificence, but not beauty. If a European came over here and found that New York was beautiful {{in the same way as}} the European cities he knew he would be very much disappointed. I do not see how you can make New York beautiful in that way with the laws and the democratic spirit that you have here [...] The kind of beauty that makes Paris charming can only exist when private rights and personal liberty are or have been trampled on. [...] Only when the mob rules, or where kings rule, so that there is at one time absolutely no respect for the property of the rich and at another time for the rights of the poor can the beauties of Paris be realized.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "murderer" [...] that he {{was hunting}} had never {{actually}} killed anyone, but he had manipulated others to kill for him, subtly and psychologically manipulating the moments where others desire to commit murder so that they carry out the crime when they might otherwise dismiss their thoughts {{as nothing more than}} a momentary passion. Poirot thus was forced to kill the man himself, as otherwise he would have continued his actions and never been officially convicted, as he did not legally do anything wrong. It is revealed at the end of Curtain that he fakes his need for a wheelchair to fool people into believing that he is suffering from arthritis, {{to give the impression that}} he is more infirm than he is. His last recorded words are [...] "Cher ami!", spoken to Hastings as the Captain left his room. (The TV adaptation adds that as Poirot is dying alone, he whispers out his final prayer to God in these words: [...] "Forgive me... forgive...") Poirot was buried at Styles, and his funeral was arranged by his best friend Hastings and Hastings' daughter Judith. Hastings reasoned, [...] "Here was the spot where he had lived when he first <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> He was to lie here at the last." ...|$|E

The award seeks to commend strong, unique, enduring voices that – throughout long, consistently accomplished careers – have told us something about the American experience." [...] In a statement issued in response to the award, DeLillo said [...] "When I received news of this award, my first thoughts were of my mother and father, who <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> the hard way, as young people confronting a new language and culture.

Osman was the only person charged over the initial confrontation. The Magistrate, Jacqueline Trad (herself of Lebanese descent) told Sutherland Local Court that Osman had turned his back on his real country: [...] "By this sort of conduct you turned your back on your family, your culture and your real country, all for the sake of some juvenile, impulsive and misplaced allegiance.... Over the last 100 years or so, the ancestors of many citizens – mine included – <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> seeking refuge from hatred, intolerance, violence or just simply the opportunity to improve their families' prospects." [...] Yahya Jamal Serhan was arrested over the stabbing of [...] "Dan" [...] on 12 December and charged with affray and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and was sentenced to 13 months jail but was immediately released after having already spent nine months in custody awaiting trial. Dan was angered and disappointed by the sentence, saying [...] "I've got no feeling on the left hand side of my back where the knife broke off." [...] A second person, a 17-year–old, was also questioned by police.|$|E
