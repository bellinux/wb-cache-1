40|$|This paper {{presents}} and comments {{the results of}} sales experiments on newly developed organic meat products. The main goal of a research {{study was to examine}} the issue of consumer acceptance of organic sausage products with no <b>curing</b> <b>agents.</b> The sales experiment lasted over 12 weeks and was run in six supermarkets offering several variants of organic sausages of which three were produced without <b>curing</b> <b>agents</b> and therefore looked different to the variants produced with nitrite. The results allow an analysis of the consumer acceptance for organic meat products produced with and without <b>curing</b> <b>agents</b> as well as a description of the influence of the introduction of organic sausage variants without nitrite on the share of total sales of organic and conventional sausages. Results show a significant increase in sales of organic sausages and even of total sales of sausages and therefore contradict often heard judgements of German market actors that an additional offer of sausages without <b>curing</b> <b>agents</b> would confuse consumers and would lead to a decrease of organic sales...|$|R

50|$|The {{second most}} {{important}} part of FBE coatings is the <b>curing</b> <b>agent</b> or hardener. Curing agents react either with the epoxy ring or with the hydroxyl groups, along the epoxy molecular chain. Various types of curing agents, used in FBE manufacture, include dicyandiamide, aromatic amines, aliphatic diamines, etc. The selected <b>curing</b> <b>agent</b> determines the nature of the final FBE product — its cross linking density, chemical resistance, brittleness, flexibility etc. The ratio of epoxy resins and curing agents in a formulation is determined by their relative equivalent weights.|$|E
40|$|Epoxy resins {{constitute}} {{a class of}} thermosets which contains more than one epoxide group per molecule, which are very reactive to many <b>curing</b> <b>agents</b> like aromatic or aliphatic amines, acid anhydrides or isocyanates. They are used as reinforced composites, adhesives, high performance coatings and encapsulating materials. Epoxy thermosets have excellent electrical and mechanical properties, good adhesion to many metals and resistance to moisture and thermal and environment exposure. <b>Curing</b> <b>agents</b> that show no activity under normal conditions but show activity by external stimulation, like temperature, can be called ’’latent curing agents”. Among the thermal latent <b>curing</b> <b>agents</b> dicyandiamide (DICY) {{is one of the}} most employed in epoxy resin technology. The latent nature of this type of <b>curing</b> <b>agents</b> is due to the insolubility in epoxy resins at room temperature. The use of dihydrazides as <b>curing</b> <b>agents</b> has been scarcely reported in scientific literature but there are some dihydrazides commercially available as latent <b>curing</b> <b>agents.</b> In the present study a series of dihydrazides with different structures were prepared by reaction of dicarboxylic diester with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol. These compounds were studied as <b>curing</b> <b>agents</b> in DGEBA/dihydrazide 2 : 1 (mol/mol) formulations demonstrating their latent character. In the dihydrazides we have prepared, with aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic moieties a relationship between the melting point of the dihydrazides and the initial curing temperature was observed with the exception of the cycloaliphatic dihydrazide, which was amorphous but initiate the cure at the highest temperature.

50|$|Durcon Epoxy Resin worksurfaces are {{thermosets}} cured {{through three}} stages. By combining two reactive materials - monolithic epoxy resin and the <b>curing</b> <b>agent</b> - with a catalyst and heat, the resin and <b>curing</b> <b>agent</b> react {{to result in}} the branching of chains. As curing continues, molecular weight accelerates causing viscosity to increase. Eventually, the material changes from a viscous liquid to a solid gel. The material is then placed into a curing oven to increase durability and solidity. The final stage of curing results in completion of the cross-linking process at which the average molecule weight diverges to infinity. Thermosets like epoxy resin possess good dimensional stability, thermal stability and chemical resistance.|$|E
