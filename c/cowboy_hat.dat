5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with shots of New York City, and then has Hamasaki on a rooftop. Hamasaki is then singing the track with several different camera angles circulating her and the city. During the first verse, it has her in an apartment, sitting on a couch with a butterfly hair clip; this scene is used throughout the entire video. It then has three shots of her in different clothes; one with a brown leather jacket, brown wig and <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat,</b> the second with a red dress on, and the third with a black jacket and crop hair style. The shot {{with her in the}} brown leather jacket, brown wig and <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat</b> then shows her on a rooftop singing the song. The final pre-chorus and chorus has her driving through New York City, and has her in a pink dress watching the snow fall; it ends with her in the red dress, holding her hands out for the snow to fall. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016).|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Corgan reading {{a comic book}} dressed in an ice cream man uniform. A clip of the intro to the song is played and stopped {{repeatedly}} before the song begins. Groups {{of two or more}} people are kissing each other around Corgan as he drives in an ice cream van through a desert. Corgan picks up a dress-wearing Iha and the two drive for a while before stopping at a gas station, where Chamberlin and Wretzky appear as gas attendants. After Iha changes into a yellow and white cowboy outfit, the band paints the van in a multitude of colors. More people are shown kissing in the hills as the band drives away from the gas station in the van. However, Corgan is ultimately kicked out of the van, and the video ends with Corgan walking off the road wearing a <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat</b> as the van drives away. The video was filmed on August 29, 1993.|$|E

25|$|In 1865 hatmaker John B. Stetson {{invented the}} Boss of the Plains hat. It gained {{immediate}} {{success in the}} Old West among cowboys and settlers, due to its practicality. It had a vaguely round ribbon-lined crown and a wide brim, originally straight but soon becoming stylized into the iconic rim of the typical <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat.</b> Its dense felt could be rugged enough to carry water.|$|E

25|$|The <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat</b> is a high-crowned, wide-brimmed hat {{best known}} as the {{defining}} piece of attire for the North American cowboy. Today it is worn by many people, and is particularly associated with ranch workers in the western and southern United States, western Canada and northern Mexico, with country-western singers, and for participants in the North American rodeo circuit. It is recognized around the world as part of Old West cowboy lore. The shape of a cowboy hat's crown and brim are often modified by the wearer for fashion and to protect against weather. The <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat</b> was invented in 1865 by John Batterson Stetson during a hunting trip, showing his companions how he could make fabric out of fur without weaving. Using the fur collected during the trip, his bare hands, and boiling water, Stetson made a piece of felt and then shaped it into a hat with a large brim which could protect him and his hunting party from weather elements such as rain, wind, and snow.|$|E

The quick-drawing Dum fires first, yet Mahesuan is uninjured.

25|$|The first A380 {{aircraft}} to operate Flight 7/8 sported a special livery: the kangaroo {{painted on the}} aircraft's empennage (tail) wore a white <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat</b> and star-speckled blue kerchief around its neck. The hat and kerchief pay homage to the Dallas region's strong association with cowboy culture and the red background, white kangaroo/hat, and star-speckled blue are suggestive of the US flag. With the change in aircraft, Qantas became the first airline to operate an A380 at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, although Emirates began A380 to DFW just 2 days later.|$|E

25|$|Western riders wear a long-sleeved shirt, denim jeans, boots, and a wide-brimmed <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat.</b> Cowboy boots, {{which have}} pointed toes and higher heels than a {{traditional}} riding boot, {{are designed to}} prevent the rider's foot from slipping through the stirrup during a fall, preventing the rider from being dragged—most western saddles have no safety bars for the leathers or automatic stirrup release mechanism. A rider may wear protective leather leggings called chaps.

25|$|The {{music video}} for Manson's cover was {{a gateway to}} {{popularity}} for the band, eventually being nominated at the MTV Video Music Awards for Best Rock Video, and contains several clips of Manson and band members in {{what appears to be}} an old, decrepit asylum whilst wearing a variety of strange costumes. The overall video was shot with unusual filters: {{this was one of the}} first videos shot with director Dean Karr's initial vision intact, not based solely on whatever ideas the band had come up with prior. In between these clips are a number of surreal shots of Manson wearing a wedding gown, Manson wandering around an abandoned street in a tutu, birds fluttering around him and leaving dropping on his body, and footage of him riding a pig wearing a <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat</b> whilst covered with mud which Manson rides during the song's climax.|$|E

However, Emirates never switched back to the A380 after that.
