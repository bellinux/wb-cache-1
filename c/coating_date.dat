40|$|Plasma surface {{engineering}} {{has become a}} key technology in Germany {{during the past two}} decades. The history of surface <b>coating</b> <b>dates</b> back to 1817 when Fraunhofer deposited antireflective films on lenses. Today, plasma-based processes are widespread in various industrial branches. They are used by 50 % of German companies being active in the field of machine construction. A further growth is limited by high costs and a qualification deficiency. Nevertheless, a lot of companies, in particular small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), plan to introduce new processes or modernize existing ones within the next two years. New developments focus on tribological coatings like diamond-like caron (DLC) and cubic boron nitride (c-BN). Pulse magnetron sputtering has opened the door to new applications of optical coatings on large areas. Solar cell manufactures ask for low cost deposition of semiconducting thin films and transparent conductive oxides. Concerning the field of information technology, high performance mirrors for EUV lithography and ultra-thin carbon overcoats for magnetic disks are in the center of interest. The information about surface technology is scattered, unstructured and often not easily accessible. To overcome this dilemma, a suitable network has been created, and electronic information systems like INO® were built up...|$|R
