With reference to Paul Virilio, it is possible to determine that GPS localization contributes considerably to the normalization of automobile acceleration, which affirms Virilio's science of "dromology". Based on Michel Foucault's spatial understanding, {{it can be argued that}} the heterotopia of driving would be perfected with the aid of an "augmented reality" <b>navigation</b> <b>system.</b> The exposed cross-disciplinary understanding of geography as a cognitive system and more precisely as a superpositioning method, in combination with the fact that trajectography bypasses the prevailing discourses in cartography, and that external data bases or at least entire media systems are incorporated into the map functionality, requires reference to more than just "mobile cartography" or "telecartography". It seems to be appropriate to term media, such as <b>car</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems,</b> with converging cartographic and media applications, as the genre of "geomedia"...|$|R

From then on, the system self-corrected: error accumulated through dead reckoning could usually be reduced by checking to see if the current location and direction of movement corresponded to a street in the map data.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Car</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> are {{now widely}} used, whereas {{pedestrian}} <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> {{have not yet}} found widespread application. Current pedestrian <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> are designed analogously to <b>car</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> where the movement of vehicles is constrained by the street network (specifically the lanes). Such a wayfinding model {{does not reflect the}} possibilities of pedestrians, where movement is subject to different constrains compared to car drivers. In this paper we describe a new pedestrian wayfinding model that addresses this problem. A graph model is created which consists of decision points and edges connecting them. The free (walkable) space around decision points is expanded to decision scenes where pedestrian movement is modeled in more detail, thus allowing for flexible navigation comparable to unassisted pedestrians. We connect this model with the cognitive needs of users of pedestrian <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> and show how our approach incorporates these. ...|$|R
40|$|With the {{advanced}} capabilities of mobile devices {{and the success}} of <b>car</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems,</b> interest in pedestrian <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> is on the rise. A critical component of any <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> is a map database which represents a network (e. g., road networks in <b>car</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems)</b> and supports key functionality such as map display, geocoding, and routing. Road networks, mainly due to the popularity of <b>car</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems,</b> are well defined and publicly available. However, in pedestrian <b>navigation</b> <b>systems,</b> as well as other applications including urban planning and physical activities studies, road networks do not adequately represent the paths that pedestrians usually travel. Currently, there are no techniques to automatically construct pedestrian networks, impeding research and development of applications requiring pedestrian data. This coupled with the increased demand for pedestrian networks is the prime motivation for this dissertation which is focused on development of a methodology and algorithms that can construct pedestrian networks automatically. A methodology, which involves three independent approaches, network buffering (using existing road networks), collaborative mapping (using GPS traces collected by volunteers), and image processing (using high-resolution satellite and laser imageries) was developed. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the pedestrian networks constructed by these approaches with a pedestrian network baseline as a ground truth. The results of the experiments indicate that these three approaches, while differing in complexity and outcome, are viable for automatically constructing pedestrian networks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Most car {{navigation}} systems {{estimate the}} car po-sition from dead reckoning and the Global Positioning System (GPS).

40|$|Abstract: Today, <b>car</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} applications of navigation system that is frequently used by drivers. Quality of maps, presented to drivers, has a direct imp act on usability and performance of the system. In this context, displaying maps in various scales which are adapted to user’s conditions and situations is a vital issue. In other words, users in different situations need maps with various scales to fulfill their information requirements. Since, using <b>car</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> is a secondary task for drivers (elementary task is driving and controlling cars) therefore, selecting and presenting maps with proper scale must be accomplished intelligently and automatically by the system. This paper proposes that in order to achieve the mentioned aim, context-aware computing should be utilized. Context-aware computing is a computing paradigm that enables systems to acquire current user’s context s and adapt their behavior accordingly. In this paper, the context-awareness potential for presenting maps with various scales which adapted to users context s is evaluated. Also various contexts that may have an impact on map scale are studied and then an approach to select proper scale in these contexts is proposed. As a proof of the idea, a prototype context-aware <b>car</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> is developed, implemented and tested in parts of Tehran, capital city of Iran.
