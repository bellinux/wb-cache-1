5|$|Credit Information: The {{use of the}} Lebanese Identity Card can {{enable the}} banks in the Republic of Lebanon to easily {{establish}} persons credit-worthiness from the Credit Referencing Agencies any time they apply for a loan. This may lead drastically to the reduction in bank rates on loans since the banks <b>can</b> <b>establish</b> whether they are already servicing a loan from another bank which {{will result in a}} reduction in the incidents of bad debts.|$|E

5|$|The UN Charter {{stipulates}} that each primary {{organ of the}} United Nations <b>can</b> <b>establish</b> various specialized agencies to fulfil its duties. Some best-known agencies are the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The UN performs most of its humanitarian work through these agencies. Examples include mass vaccination programmes (through WHO), the avoidance of famine and malnutrition (through {{the work of the}} WFP), and the protection of vulnerable and displaced people (for example, by UNHCR).|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an oblique, isometric format and is set inside a haunted castle. As Sir Arthur Pendragon, the player's main objective is to collect sixteen pieces of a key before midnight, which when all connected will form {{the shape of a}} pentacle. The pieces of the pentacle are guarded by various magical creatures, some of which can be defeated by casting spells, others requiring accurately timed attacks and nimble dodging. Once a piece is obtained, the player must take it to a specific chamber within the castle. Once all pentacles have been placed in their chambers, the player <b>can</b> <b>establish</b> the whereabouts of the Staff of Karnath, which must be destroyed before midnight.|$|E
5|$|Otters do not {{dramatically}} reduce prey {{populations in}} the wild, generally speaking. When a copious supply of food dwindles or other prey becomes available, otters either transfer to a new location or convert their dietary choices to the most adequate prey. When left unchecked, though, otter depredations can be quite significant under certain circumstances (e.g. in hatcheries or other fish culture facilities). Likewise, the potential predatory impact of otters may be considerable whenever fish are physically confined (most commonly in smaller ponds offering sparse cover or other escape options). Resolution of such conflicts will usually require removal and/or relocation of nuisance otters. Even in larger bodies of water, they may take disproportional advantage of any seasonal concentrations of fish when and where only very limited areas of suitable spawning, low-flow, or over-wintering habitat may exist. Even such fast-swimming species as trout become lethargic in extremely cold water, with a commensurate increase in their vulnerability to predation. As such, careful consideration of any threatened, endangered, or fish species of special interest is warranted prior to reintroduction of otters to a watershed. Although other prey species are of temporary significance to the river otter, the deciding factor whether the river otter <b>can</b> <b>establish</b> itself as a permanent resident of one location is the year-round availability of fish.|$|E

5|$|The main map (the upper {{two thirds}} of the screen) is divided into squares, on which players <b>can</b> <b>establish</b> bases, move units and engage in combat. Through terraforming, players may modify the effects of the {{individual}} map squares on movement, combat and resources. Resources are used to feed the population, construct units and facilities, and supply energy. Players can allocate energy between research into new technology and energy reserves. Unlike Civilization II, new technology grants access to additional unit components rather than pre-designed units, allowing players to design and re-design units as their factions' priorities shift. Energy reserves allow the player to upgrade units, maintain facilities, and attempt to win by the Global Energy Market scenario. Bases are military strongpoints and objectives that are vital for all winning strategies. They produce military units, house the population, collect energy, and build secret projects and Subspace Generators. Facilities and secret projects improve the performance of individual bases and of the entire faction.|$|E

Therefore, a debtor’s estate may be sequestrated even though he is technically solvent.|$|E
