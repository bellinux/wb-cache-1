50|$|In 1984 import tariffs were changed, {{causing the}} V45 engine to be modified. Honda reduced the {{displacement}} to 698 cc by destroking the motor from 48.6 mm to 45.4 mm, added a tooth on the <b>clutch</b> <b>gear</b> {{to compensate for}} a loss of torque and changed the model name to VF700S.

This is a standard technique in most countries where manual transmissions remain popular, for example the UK. Cars equipped with a parking brake pedal are not suited for this maneuver unless it is released by hand, for example in the Citroen XM.|$|E
50|$|A {{fourth-generation}} Scénic {{was unveiled}} at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. The car, {{based on the}} R-Space concept, is slightly larger than its predecessor and adds some crossover design elements but, according to Renault, it is still an MPV. It will be powered by six diesel and two petrol engines. For the models with 6-speed manual transmission and Energy dCi 110 diesel engines it will incorporate an optional hybrid unit (Hybrid Assist).The Scénic will be offered with manual or double <b>clutch</b> <b>gear</b> box.The Scénic offer a 572 l trunk and the Grand Scénic 765 l with five seats.|$|E

50|$|Gears {{have been}} {{included}} within Lego Technic sets since 1977 {{as a way of}} transferring rotary power, and of gearing-up or down the speed. Gears come in several sizes: 8 tooth, 16 tooth, 24 tooth and 40 tooth spur gears; 12 tooth, 20 tooth and 36 tooth double bevel gears; and 12 tooth and 20 tooth single bevel gears. The double bevel gears are cut so they can also be meshed as spur gears. There is also a 16 tooth <b>clutch</b> <b>gear,</b> and a 24 tooth friction gear that slips when a certain amount of torque is put on it to prevent motors from damaging any parts or burning themselves out.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the heart}} of the system, acting as {{pressure}} sink as well as suspension elements, are the so-called spheres, five or six in all; one per wheel and one main accumulator as well as a dedicated brake accumulator on some models. On later cars fitted with Hydractive or Activa suspension, there may be as many as ten spheres. Spheres consist of a hollow metal ball, open to the bottom, with a flexible desmopan rubber membrane, fixed at the 'equator' inside, separating top and bottom. The top is filled with nitrogen at high pressure, up to 75 bar, the bottom connects to the car's hydraulic fluid circuit. The high pressure pump, powered by the engine, pressurizes the hydraulic fluid (LHM) and an accumulator sphere maintains a reserve of hydraulic power. This part of the circuit is at between 150 and 180 bars. It powers the front brakes first, prioritised via a security valve, and depending on type of vehicle, can power the steering, <b>clutch,</b> <b>gear</b> selector, etc.|$|E

Further, to comply with components tolerances and spreads in the production line, an automatic procedure for the end-of-line tuning of the transmission control system is proposed to objectively classify {{the quality of the}} gear shift and automatically optimize it. The suitability of the proposed approach is thoroughly tested on an instrumented vehicle...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} is a summary of information was received from Limitorque via facsimile: "On August 2, 2011, Flowserve-Limitorque was notified by Browns Ferry Nuclear (BFN) Generating Station that a Limitorque SMB- 5 T valve actuator (1 -MVOP- 074 - 052) had failed to run open automatically during {{the performance of a}} stroke test. Electrical maintenance personnel working at the valve reported an abnormal mechanical noise. Upon disassembly, {{it was found that the}} driving lugs on both the sliding <b>clutch</b> <b>gear</b> and the flexible clutch were seriously worn with a significant amount of deformation. Further investigation by BFN showed that the declutch mechanism would not allow full engagement of the drive lugs on the sliding clutch and flexible clutch. These lugs must be engaged for motor operation to take place. The declutch mechanism required adjustment to allow full drive lug engagement. "Following reassembly of the SMB- 5 T on 1 -MVOP- 074 - 052, an inspection was performed of the SMB- 5 T on valve 1 -MVOP- 074 - 066 which was manufactured and supplied to TVA at the same time. This actuator was functioning normally at the time of the inspection. Disassembly of the clutch compartment revealed evidence of deformation of the clutch drive lugs. To better evaluate the operation of the clutch components, the grease was cleaned out of the compartment and a boroscope used so that the action of the clutch could be seen. Boroscope examination of several declutching and re-clutching tests showed that the clutch lugs would not engage fully. The majo...|$|E

2500|$|In 1976, Honda {{introduced}} the CB750A to the United States, with the A suffix designating [...] "automatic," [...] for its automatic transmission. Although the 2-speed transmission includes a torque converter typical of an automatic transmission, the transmission {{does not automatically}} change gears for the rider. Each gear is selected by a foot-controlled hydraulic valve/selector (similar in operation to a manual transmission motorcycle). The foot selector controls the application of high pressure oil to a single clutch pack (one <b>clutch</b> for each <b>gear),</b> causing the selected <b>clutch</b> (and <b>gear)</b> to engage. The selected gear remains selected until changed by the rider, or the kickstand is lowered (which shifts the transmission to neutral).|$|R

50|$|Manual {{transmission}} {{is also known}} as a manual gearbox, stick shift, standard, and stick.

The system's high-efficiency power transmission mechanism is on par with a normal manual gearbox, while allowing quicker gear shifting with no drop-off in engine power, thus offering greater performance and better fuel economy.
