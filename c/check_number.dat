2500|$|This {{first draft}} revised system was [...] "UIC compliant" [...] {{insofar as the}} <b>check</b> <b>number</b> was {{calculated}} {{in accordance with the}} UIC regulations. [...] On the other hand, the first draft did not envisage the display of a vehicle's numbers as twelve digits in the standard UIC designated form (for locomotives) of 9x 85 x xxx xxx - x for the Swiss Federal Railways, and 9x 63 x xxx xxx - x for the BLS. [...] Under the first draft revised system, the first five digits were each designated as nil, as was already the case with various other European railway companies. [...] Numbers displayed in that manner could be used only domestically, which at that time seemed sufficient.|$|E

Above the eagle is a radiant cluster of 13 stars arranged in a six-pointed star. The eagle's breast is covered by a heraldic shield with 13 stripes that resemble those on the American flag. As on the first US flag, {{the stars and stripes}} stand for the 13 original states of the union. The eagle holds a ribbon in its beak reading [...] "E PLURIBUS UNUM," [...] a Latin phrase meaning [...] "Out of many , one ," [...] a de facto motto of the United States (and the only one until 1956). In its left talons the eagle holds 13 arrows, and in its right talons it holds an olive branch with 13 leaves and 13 olives, representing, respectively, the powers of war and peace. To the right of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends {{toward the edge of the}} bill. [...] A plate position (<b>check)</b> <b>number</b> is normally found to the left of the eagle.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{opinion is}} shared by British {{historian}} Neill Lochery. In 2011, Lochery quoted Milgram´s numbers and to further support his view he also cross <b>checked</b> <b>numbers</b> with the Portuguese Emigration Police files and he also concluded that the numbers usually published by popular literature are a “Myth”. Both these historians concur that this does not diminish the greatness of Sousa Mendes´s gesture. Rui Afonso, the first Sousa Mendes biographer, also says, that José Seabra, Sousa Mendes´ deputy at Bordeaux, always testified that the order of magnitude of irregular visas issued at Bordeaux was within hundreds.|$|R

The DMA sent between 1,000-2,000 complaints to the Information Commissioner's Office each month, yet no penalty fines had been imposed in at least 18 months.|$|R
