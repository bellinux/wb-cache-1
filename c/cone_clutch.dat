50|$|A <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> {{serves the}} same purpose as a disk or plate clutch. However, instead of mating two {{spinning}} disks, the <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> uses two conical surfaces to transmit torque by friction.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the name}} implies, a <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> has conical {{friction}} surfaces. The cone's taper {{means that a}} given amount of movement of the actuator makes the surfaces approach (or recede) much more slowly than in a disc clutch. As well, a given amount of actuating force creates more pressure on the mating surfaces.The best known example of a <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> is a synchronizer ring in a manual transmission. The synchronizer ring is responsible for [...] "synchronizing" [...] the speeds of the shift hub and the gear wheel to ensure a smooth gear change.|$|E

50|$|They {{are usually}} now {{confined}} to very specialist transmissions in racing, rallying, or in extreme off-road vehicles, {{although they are}} common in power boats. This is because the clutch {{does not have to}} be pushed in all the way and the gears will be changed quicker. Small <b>cone</b> <b>clutches</b> are used in synchronizer mechanisms in manual transmissions and some limited-slip differentials.|$|R

50|$|Frictional <b>clutches,</b> usually leather-faced <b>cone</b> <b>clutches,</b> were in {{use before}} the Hele-Shaw clutch. Their {{difficulty}} {{was one of}} materials science {{and the lack of}} a suitable friction material, before asbestos clutch linings, that could handle the specific power / area at an elevated operating temperature. As the Hele-Shaw clutch did not rely on friction, it generated {{only a fraction of the}} heat of other designs and its construction was easily able to disperse this.|$|R
50|$|After World War I {{production}} {{concentrated on}} the 15/25 hp (RAC rating of 15.9 hp) with a 3-litre, four-cylinder long-stroke, fixed head engine. It also had a <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> and a foot-operated transmission brake.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> {{transfers}} {{a higher}} torque than plate or disk clutches {{of the same}} size due to the wedging action and increased surface area. Cone clutches are generally now only used in low peripheral speed applications although they were once common in automobiles and other combustion engine transmissions.|$|E
5000|$|The car {{presented}} in 1912 was {{powered by a}} four-cylinder [...] "in-line" [...] engine of 2,610 cc delivering a maximum of [...] at 1,600 rpm. Power passed through a leather <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> (“Lederkonuskupplung“) via a four-speed transmission and steel propeller shaft to the rear wheels. Top speed was given as approximately 70 km/h (45 mph).|$|E
5000|$|Inverted <b>cone</b> fabric <b>clutch</b> {{carried on}} light ribbed steel flywheel. Hotchkiss drive; {{transverse}} {{driven by a}} worm gear reduction for servo motor braking system (removed after the G.P.).|$|R
5000|$|Like {{almost all}} Renaults up till this time, the car used a <b>cone</b> based <b>clutch,</b> {{combined}} with a three speed manual transmission as on the old pre-war 10CV. The brakes only affected the rear wheels. The prominent [...] "gills" [...] {{on the sides of}} the bonnet/hood reflected the positioning of the radiator behind the engine.|$|R
50|$|The L Series used a Sterling six-cylinder L-head engine {{rated at}} 35 bhp and was offered with an Auto-lite {{electric}} starter. A <b>cone</b> style <b>clutch</b> was mounted {{to the engine}} with a drive shaft that was connected to a rear end mounted selective sliding 3 speed transmission. The car used a 3/4 floating type rear suspension with 34 x 4 inch tires.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1900, the Lanchester Motor Company {{had built}} cars with {{manually}} controlled epicyclic gearboxes, {{first with a}} <b>cone</b> <b>clutch,</b> then with multi-plate clutches. These formed the ratio-changing gearbox of the transmission. In 1918, an experimental tank [...] "Lanchester Gearbox Machine" [...] or [...] "Experimental Machine K" [...] was tested, fitted with an epicyclic gearbox built by Lanchester.|$|E
50|$|In a {{synchromesh}} gearbox, {{to correctly}} match {{the speed of}} the gear to that of the shaft as the gear is engaged the collar initially applies a force to a cone-shaped brass clutch attached to the gear, which brings the speeds to match prior to the collar locking into place. The collar is prevented from bridging the locking rings when the speeds are mismatched by synchro rings (also called blocker rings or baulk rings, the latter being spelled balk in the U.S.). The synchro ring rotates slightly due to the frictional torque from the <b>cone</b> <b>clutch.</b> In this position, the dog clutch is prevented from engaging. The brass clutch ring gradually causes parts to spin at the same speed. When they do spin the same speed, there is no more torque from the <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> and the dog clutch is allowed to fall into engagement. In a modern gearbox, the action of all of these components is so smooth and fast it is hardly noticed.|$|E
50|$|Synchromesh {{transmission}} {{was introduced}} by Cadillac in 1928. If the dog teeth {{make contact with the}} gear, but the two parts are spinning at different speeds, the teeth will fail to engage and a loud grinding sound will be heard as they clatter together. For this reason, a modern dog clutch in an automobile has a synchronizer mechanism or synchromesh, which consists of a <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> and blocking ring. Before the teeth can engage, the <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> engages first, which brings the selector and gear to the same speed using friction. Until synchronization occurs, the teeth are prevented from making contact, because further motion of the selector is prevented by a blocker (or baulk) ring. When synchronization occurs, friction on the blocker ring is relieved and it twists slightly, bringing into alignment certain grooves or notches that allow further passage of the selector which brings the teeth together. The exact design of the synchronizer varies among manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|The Siemens-Schuckert R.VIII was a bomber {{aircraft}} {{designed and}} built in Germany from 1916. Having built the Steffen R series, Siemens-Schuckert planned to produce a six engined Riesenflugzeug (giant aeroplane) for the Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches (Imperial German Flying Corps). In common {{with many of the}} other contemporary R projects, the R.VIII had all six engines inside the fuselage, where they were tended by mechanics, driving two tractor and two pusher propellers mounted between the mainplanes, via leather <b>cone</b> <b>clutches</b> combining gearboxes, shafts and bevel gearboxes. Two aircraft were built but only the first, R23/16, was completed. Ground trials began in 1919, after the armistice but were interrupted by a gearbox failure which resulted in a propeller breaking up and causing extensive damage. The second airframe, R24/16, was never completed and the first was not repaired after the ground running accident due to the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. At the time of its completion the Siemens-Schuckert R.VIII was the largest aeroplane in the world; (the Mannesman-Poll triplane was to have been much larger but was not completed before the Versailles Treaty came into force).|$|R
5000|$|This type {{includes}} {{helical gear}} limited-slip differentials and <b>clutch,</b> <b>cone</b> (an alternative type of clutch) where the engagement {{force of the}} clutch {{is a function of}} the input torque applied to the differential (as the engine applies more torque the clutches grip harder and Trq d [...] decreases).Torque sensing LSDs respond to driveshaft torque, so that the more driveshaft input torque present, the harder the <b>clutches,</b> <b>cones</b> or gears are pressed together, and thus the more closely the drive wheels are coupled to each other. Some include spring loading to provide some small torque so that with little or no input torque (trailing throttle/gearbox in neutral/main clutch depressed) the drive wheels are minimally coupled. The amount of preload (hence static coupling) on the <b>clutches</b> or <b>cones</b> is affected by the general condition (wear) and by how tightly they are loaded.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the planes}} {{designed}} and built was Riesenflugzeug ("giant aircraft") AEG R.I. This aircraft was powered by four [...] Mercedes D.IVa engines linked to a combination leather <b>cone</b> and dog <b>clutch.</b> The first flight tests were satisfactory, but on September 3, 1918, the R.I broke {{up in the air}} killing its seven crewmen.|$|R
50|$|The car {{is powered}} by a water cooled, four {{cylinder}} 1460 cc four cylinder engine usually of the side valve type but some had overhead valves. The engine had a bore of 68mm and a stroke of 100mm. A Solex carburettor was used. This drove the rear wheels via a <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> and four speed gearbox. The chassis had rigid axles and half elliptic springs.|$|E
50|$|The Silver Hawk {{was similar}} to Macklin's {{previous}} Eric-Campbell design. It had a stylish aluminium body, external exhaust and used a tuned and lightened 1,498cc side-valve engine made by Coventry-Simplex rated at 10/35 hp that drove the rear wheels through a <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> and three or four speed transmission. The suspension used semi elliptic leaf springs at the front and cantilever springs at the rear.|$|E
5000|$|Cars were {{produced}} over two periods: from 1902 to 1915, and again from 1922 to 1925. The first proper Ariel {{car was a}} [...] twin-cylinder car produced in 1902. [...] In 1903, their first four-cylinder was a 15/19 model. Both these vehicles had a leather <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> that was entirely separate from the flywheel. In early 1904, Ariel began production of a six-cylinder model built on a seemingly inadequate tubular steel chassis.|$|E
50|$|The {{clutch type}} has {{a stack of}} thin clutch-discs, half of which are coupled {{to one of the}} drive shafts, the other half of which are coupled to the spider gear carrier. The clutch stacks may be present on both drive shafts, or on only one. If on only one, the {{remaining}} drive shaft is linked to the clutched drive shaft through the spider gears. In a <b>cone</b> type the <b>clutches</b> are replaced by a pair of cones which are pressed together achieving the same effect.|$|R
50|$|The 1,282 cc V-twin Daimler {{engine was}} mounted at the back, and {{produced}} 3.7 hp. The cooling radiator was mounted {{at the front}} of the vehicle and the coolant flowed within the chassis tubing. Transmission was via a <b>cone</b> <b>clutch,</b> 4 speed gearbox and chains propelling the rear wheels. Some models had steel wire wheels with rubber tyres and others had wooden wheels. The weight was circa 650 kg and top speed was 18-20 km/h.|$|E
50|$|The Palmerston had a 6-9 hp Coventry-Victor water cooled, flat {{twin engine}} driving {{the rear wheels}} through a <b>cone</b> <b>clutch,</b> {{separately}} mounted three speed gearbox and bevel geared rear axle. The brakes acted on the rear wheels using a hand lever with the foot brake operating a transmission brake on the drive shaft behind the gearbox. The steel section chassis had quarter elliptic leaf springs front and rear. The early cars had wire spoked wheels later replaced by steel disc type.|$|E
50|$|In 1909 a new {{range of}} larger cars was {{introduced}} by T.B. André with engines ranging in size between 2210 cc and 3617 cc. The 12 hp model was priced at £120 and had a 2.8-litre four-cylinder engine with the cylinders cast in pairs, magneto ignition, a <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> driving the 3-speed gearbox, with shaft drive to the rear wheels. The range included a 3.1-litre model with four cylinders, plus a 3.6-litre six-cylinder model which was priced at £350. This range was marketed until 1911.|$|E
50|$|After World War I in 1919 {{the make}} was revived under new {{ownership}} {{and the company}} was registered as the Little Midland Light Car Co Ltd and based in Duke Street, Blackburn. The company was re-organised in 1920 and moved to Southgate Works, Preston. The post war car used a 980cc JAP water cooled V-twin engine, <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> and three speed gearbox with chain to the rear axle. The suspension used quarter elliptic springs all round. The body had two seats plus a dickey seat and cost £200 in 1920.|$|E
50|$|The Eric-Campbell 10 (10/22 in 1924) was {{assembled}} from bought-in components with a Coventry-Simplex 1498 cc, four cylinder, {{side valve}} engine driving {{the rear wheels}} through a <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> and three speed Moss gearbox. The engine was tuned with a special camshaft and lightened pistons. Half elliptic leaf springs were fitted at the front whilst at the rear cantilever springing was used. A top speed of 55 mph was guaranteed and 60 mph claimed as possible. Two seat polished aluminium bodies were fitted with a simulacrum of a Rolls-Royce radiator.|$|E
50|$|The company {{produced}} {{a number of}} models which were sold widely in Europe and in the USA. In 1905 these ranged from 2.3 litres to the 8.1 litre 40/52 HP and by 1914 Minerva-built Knight sleeve valve engines replaced side-valve units in the larger cars. Post-1918 only sleeve valve engines were used. Citroën's chevron gears {{were used for the}} bevel drive rear axles from 1914 and a unique feature was the Mors patented clutch, which had a contracting band system which replaced the <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> used until 1903.|$|E
50|$|After World War I in 1921 {{they made}} their first four-wheel car the 10 or 10/20 powered by a water cooled 1328 cc side valve engine which they built themselves. The car {{is thought to have}} been {{designed}} by Arthur Alderson who also worked for Calcott and Lea Francis. Drive was to the rear axle through a <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> and three speed gearbox. The car with open tourer coachwork cost £525 in 1921 falling to £225 in 1926. The last cars of this type were produced in 1926 and possibly as many as 2000 were made.|$|E
50|$|The Buick Model B was Buick's first model. It {{was built}} in Jackson, Michigan and was {{introduced}} in 1905 at the New York Auto Show. William C. Durant introduced the car himself at the exhibit, and took new car orders at the car show. It had a 2-cylinder, horizontally opposed engine - the world's first production OHV (overhead valve) engine - installed lengthwise within the frame, had a planetary transmission, with a <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> and two forward speeds and one reverse gear. The engine was rated at 21 bhp. In later years, it was renamed as improvements were made.|$|E
50|$|The {{water-cooled}} {{engine was}} a four-cylinder motor with a displacement of 3768 cm³ (bore × stroke = 100 × 120 mm) which produced 24 PS (17.6 kW). The engine had dual ignition (magneto and battery), automatic central lubrication and overhead valves. The engine power was {{transmitted to the}} rear wheels via a leather <b>cone</b> <b>clutch,</b> a four-speed gearbox with a right-hand shift mechanism and a chain. The cars had a wheelbase of 3000-3200 mm, the track was 1450 mm and the weight {{in the case of}} the double phaeton was 1650 kg. The top speed was about 70 km / h.|$|E
50|$|The {{water-cooled}} {{engine was}} a six-cylinder motor with a displacement of 6494 cm³ (bore × stroke = 105 × 125 mm), which produced 40 PS (29 kW) at 1100 rpm. The engine had magneto ignition, automatic central lubrication and overhead valves. The power was {{transmitted to the}} rear wheels via a leather <b>cone</b> <b>clutch,</b> a three-speed gearbox with a right-hand shift mechanism and a chain. The wheelbase of the car was 3280 mm, the track was 1457 mm {{and the weight of}} the chassis was 1100 kg. The top speed was about 100 km / h.|$|E
5000|$|The trucks {{sold for}} US$1,500 {{and had a}} {{planetary}} or selective transmission system complete with [...] "lubrication by splash and oil mixed with the gasoline." [...] As with most early models, the seat was over the engine. The wheelbase was 88 in with standard tread and the vehicle had a Holley carburetor with gravity feed and steering wheel control. It also had a Bosch ignition, fixed control, air-cooling with belt-driven fan, <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> and double chain drive from countershaft to dead, rectangular section axle and Brown-Lipe steering gear included. The tires were 36 in by 3 in.|$|E
50|$|For 1914 a {{completely}} new and more coventional light car was shown at the 1913 London Motor Show with a four-cylinder 1130 cc engine made by Turner but this was soon replaced by a 1286 cc water cooled side valve engine made by themselves. The engine was designed by W L Adams of the Laxtonia Engineering Works of Peterborough who also designed a World War I aero engine. The car had semi elliptic leraf springs, rear wheel only brakes and a wheelbase of 7 feet 9 inches (2362mm) and a track of 3 feet 9 inches (1143mm). Drive was to the rear axle through a <b>cone</b> <b>clutch,</b> separate three speed gearbox and torque tube.|$|E
50|$|In 1912 {{they made}} their first car, a cyclecar powered by an air cooled 998 cc V-twin engine which they built themselves. The tubular steel chassis had half {{elliptic}} springs all round. Drive was to the rear axle through a <b>cone</b> <b>clutch,</b> three speed gearbox with differential and finally a belt or chain to each rear wheel. A top speed of 50mph (80km/h) was claimed. The bodywork was open with two seats and acetylene lighting at the front and a single oil light at the rear. The basic car cost £110 or £120 with windscreen, hood, lights and horn. It was no longer being advertised in 1913 so production may have ceased.|$|E
5000|$|Both the PN and the PY {{have the}} same engine, a 5.03-litre {{flathead}} inline-four unit, with a power output between [...] at 1,000 rpm and [...] at 1,500 rpm. The radiator {{is located at the}} back of the engine. The buses' length is between 7380 mm (PY) and 8190 mm (PN), the width is of 2380 mm and the wheelbase of 4380 mm. The buses have double wheels on the rear. The early models used solid rubber tyres that were later replaced by pneumatics, improving comfort. The gearbox is a 4-speed manual unit. The first vehicles delivered have <b>cone</b> <b>clutch</b> while later models incorporated a disc clutch. The capacity of the PN is of 39 passengers.|$|E
