40|$|This paper explores {{an optimal}} {{personnel}} organization problem of <b>monetary</b> policy <b>committees.</b> First, I construct an analytically tractable model for monetary policy analysis which starts from decision-making in the <b>monetary</b> policy <b>committee.</b> Using the model, I investigate {{the relationship between}} preference heterogeneity among the committee members and the optimal structure of the <b>monetary</b> policy <b>committee.</b> The result shows that it is optimal in general cases to appoint not only inflation-minded (hawkish) persons but also output-minded (dovish) persons. This is a theoretical justification {{for the fact that}} the actual <b>monetary</b> policy <b>committees</b> (e. g., MPC of Bank of England and FOMC) usually consist of both type members as the empirical researches suggest. It also explains why the committees have replaced the single policy makers in the actual central banks. <b>monetary</b> policy, <b>committee,</b> delegation, imperfect information, higher order expectations...|$|R

40|$|More than 80 {{central banks}} use a <b>committee</b> to take <b>monetary</b> policy decisions. The {{composition}} of the committee {{and the structure of}} the meeting can affect the quality of the decision making. In this paper we review economic, experimental, sociological and psychological studies to identify criteria for the optimal institutional setting of a <b>monetary</b> <b>committee.</b> These include the optimal size of the committee, measures to encourage independent thinking, a relatively informal structure of the meeting, and abilities to identify and evaluate individual members' performances. Using these criteria, we evaluate the composition and operation of <b>monetary</b> policy <b>committees</b> in various central banks. Our findings indicate that e. g. the <b>monetary</b> policy <b>committee</b> of the Bank of England follows committee best-practice, while the committee structure of other major central banks could be improved.

40|$|In 1997, the Bank of England {{was granted}} {{operational}} responsibility for setting {{interest rates to}} meet a Government inflation target of RPIX 2. 5 percent. As part of the shift towards independence, operational decisions on monetary policy were delegated to a <b>Monetary</b> Policy <b>Committee.</b> Using voting data obtained from Minutes of <b>Monetary</b> Policy <b>Committee</b> Meetings, I show that as a group, internally appointed MPC members (insiders) on average prefer higher interest rates than external appointees (outsiders). Further, ordered logit analysis demonstrates that insiders and outsiders are motivated by different concerns when setting interest rates, with the interest rate setting behaviour of outsiders being less easy to predict than those of insiders. <b>Monetary</b> Policy <b>Committee,</b> insiders, outsiders, voting...|$|R
