50|$|The Donzo Ton (Ton is a Mandé {{word for}} age-group, religious, or {{vocational}} associations) are {{but one of}} a number of hunter fraternities common in Mandé-speaking areas of West Africa. Similar, and in the case of West Africa closely related groups, exist as the Kamajor in Sierra Leone, Poro in Liberia, the Mayi-Mayi in Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Karamojong in Uganda. Sons of Dozos, as well as new adherents, are able to be initiated into the Ton, and undergo a series of secret rituals. There has been a long history of these hunter collectives (the Segu Bambara empire is said to have grown from such a Ton) and hunters were often viewed by farming or pastoralist neighbours as possessing special power, wisdom and strength. <b>Collective</b> <b>organisations,</b> as with many vocations in West Africa, existed in part to train and pass on needed skills. Hunters, though, are found in every community, and are not a strictly inherited role. It is believed that the amulets (gris-gris) worn by Dozos possess magical properties protecting them from harm, and amplifying their vision and hearing. Such amulets, inherited brown hunting clothing, as well as special hats, are said to make them bulletproof. Each local Donzo Ton is led by an elder hunter, the donzokuntigi. Along with ritual and initiation, local Donzo Ton will meet to discuss their work, organise hunts, or settle internal grievances, often in the all-night tonsigi gathering. In this way, the Donzo Ton operates much like a western guild.|$|E

The article analyses two examples of successful social pacts: the Netherlands and Italy, both countries that first found a consensus on wage policy and then moved on to further reforms of welfare and employment policies. Thereafter, two examples of uncoordinated reform policies are discussed: Germany and France.

40|$|Many socialists support {{initiatives}} {{to develop the}} social economy. Yet the social economy is deeply ambiguous in its politics: it promises radical economic democracy, yet it is often sponsored by the Right and Centre {{as a means of}} class stabilization, workers’ self-exploitation, and social reproduction on the cheap. We locate this political ambiguity in the contradictions of capitalist accumulation, particularly the contradictions of socialisation with value relations, and show how the social economy has responded to these. This analysis of the mainstream actually-existing social economy throws doubt on its potential for socialists and on some optimistic perspectives among left commentators. We then discuss some elements of an approach to the social economy which could cut against its role in class stabilisation and begin to realise its radical promise, especially by making strong links to popular <b>collective</b> <b>organisations</b> and struggles in the mainstream economy and society. This approach provides an alternative to some recent left perspectives on the social economy which we regard as too modest and pessimistic...|$|E
40|$|Leading {{firms in}} energy and {{transport}} production seek to make ethanol a ‘global commodity’ and stretch their operations across spatial boundaries. This paper {{is concerned with the}} consequent change to work availability and quality in the sugar and ethanol industry in the west of Sao Paulo state. David Harvey’s concept of the spatial fix helps to link foreign investment of Brazil’s sugar and ethanol sector to emerging biofuel markets in Europe and the 2008 financial crisis, and explain implications for work creation and destruction. The testimonies of workers cutting and transporting sugar cane, those operating or maintaining machinery inside the new mills and former cane cutters that have joined the landless movements point to paradoxical changes to work quality and precarity and lead us to question corporate claims of social responsibility. The land and wealth concentration by leading firms expanding into the territories of Mato Grosso do Sul and Goias bring fresh challenges to the <b>collective</b> <b>organisations</b> of labour and the landless...|$|E

40|$|Toward {{exacerbated}} global changes, one of {{the main}} current challenges is to implement agrecological transition. In this context, territorial scale appears as a consistent level where governance procedures are experienced. The context is the one of a multi-level and multi-actors’ governance leading to change in local public policy. We questioned 21 key stakeholders from agricultural frameworks as well as actors from <b>collective</b> <b>organisations.</b> By combining textual analysis tools and graph theory, we focus on stakeholders’ representations of viability as these actors produce advice regarding the settings of administrative and regulatory planning. We identify four key dimensions to viability (economical, agroecological, socio-cultural and organisational). The results show a continuum on the agroecological dimension of viability. They reveal the pivotal role of gatekeepers designed as actors able to support substantive change by transforming the agroecological dimension of viability in a ‘rational myth’. By doing so, they could initiate collective actions to promote change and support agroecological transition...|$|E
40|$|As {{the latest}} {{instalments}} of protest from the Arab Spring to Occupy and beyond are digested in scholarly work, {{they point to}} a scalable, informal structure that develops as an impermanent framework for performing coordinational tasks formerly associated with <b>collective</b> <b>organisations.</b> Whilst a substitution of this nature appears a distinct possibility with social media, the participatory dynamics {{at the heart of}} such connective action remain largely uncharted. This paper scrutinizes the scope for the participatory development of motivations and resources to undertake collective action. For the purpose, it reviews an empirical study of public Facebook and Twitter communication associated with the panEuropean protest against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. Ensuing results point to a rational, resource-oriented mode of communication figuring prominently on both platforms. Moreover, the time-distribution of motivational and resource-driven talk confound earlier claims about patterns of social media usage in collective action. Finally, despite their smaller number, motivational posts had a higher impact than resource-oriented talk on both platforms – an apparent sign of their particularly positive reception...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the reconfiguration of state, corporate and labour relations that follow from the increased international investment by oil companies in Brazil’s (bio) ethanol sector. It emphasises how new path-dependent technological and institutional arrangements, conceptualised as a ‘techno-institutional fix’, interrelate with broader systemic power relations and spatial strategies of accumulation (the spatial fix). These overlap to ensure competitive advantage of agroenergy leaders and increasingly concentrate land, {{wealth and power}} in the region of focus, albeit through accumulation strategies that postpone crises rather than resolve inherent instability. Testimonies from landless workers, rural and industrial workers in the fields and factories of biofuel cultivation and distillation counter the institutional discourse linking rural and sustainable development to these new energy extractions. The relatively fixed geographical nature of these workers’ <b>collective</b> <b>organisations,</b> however, is a marked contrast to the increasing flexibility and scales of operation of the leading multinational corporations and limits their capacity to resist prevailing relations. Resulting power asymmetries or ‘power geometries’ underscore the reproduction of inequality, labour exclusion and dispossession in the new frontiers of agroenergy production...|$|E

40|$|Summaries Reform of {{policing}} in South Africa forms {{a critical part}} of the transition from white minority, authoritarian rule to a more democratic system that reflects the aspirations of the majority African communities. The article focuses on two kinds of community policing that have developed since the end of apartheid: official partnerships between the state police and local residents, as exemplified in the Community Policing Forums, and ‘community?initiated policing’ based on local <b>collective</b> <b>organisations</b> (vigilantism), semi?political groupings and private associations. The official police?community partnerships have achieved some success in increasing mutual understanding, ‘de?demonising’ their perceptions of each other and putting respect for human rights on the agenda. Ultimately, however, the pressures of rising crime and the internal upheavals experienced by the police during the transition have forced the police back into their more traditional crime?fighting mode, in which the community is seen simply as an aid to intelligence gathering — the ‘eyes and ears’ of the police. The South African state continues to flirt with private? and community?based vigilantism, motivated by its overriding concern to ‘do something’ about the bad image created internationally by the crime wave. But there are considerable dangers in this strategy if it does not attempt to bring these organisations within a more law?abiding way of operating. These issues are so politically sensitive that they can only be understood within the overall regime context...|$|E
40|$|Social {{capital is}} a rich topic in the {{development}} literature. Despite this, there is an incomplete understanding of how social capital is formed when placed within the enabling or constraining structure of Global Value Chains. While governance of Global Value Chains is well understood as a powerful force that shapes the participation of farmers, the literature to date has not effectively explored {{the extent to which}} governance may shape participation among farmers. The aim of this thesis is to explore how, if at all, governance shapes the formation of two types of farmers' social capital: structural and cognitive. Within the context of Peru's Alternative Development Program, where there is a purposeful effort to develop the social capital of farmers, qualitative research was conducted on two case study Global Value Chains: cacao and palm oil. Interviews were conducted with stakeholders across the Global Value Chain, from farmers and <b>collective</b> <b>organisations</b> to exporters and importers. The case studies revealed that governance can be an enabler of structural social capital formation, but its role is shaped by the institutional context and existing attitudes towards social structure. Governance can be an enabler or barrier to cognitive social capital formation, depending {{on the nature of the}} governing relationship between buyer and supplier. To date, the literature on social capital formation has typically focused on factors internal to a collective group. The findings in the thesis shed light on the role of exogenous structures on the formation of social capital...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} moral economies of housing centres and links the Introduction and {{contributions}} to the Special issue. A number of themes emerge. First, a variety of moral communities exist, sometimes rivalrous, sometimes internally riven, sometimes with expectations of reciprocal obligations. We therefore {{move away from the}} idea of a dyadic relationship between a singular authority and a singular recipient, be that individual citizens, households or indeed a singular moral community. Instead we uncover overlapping relations, both vertical and horizontal, as different groups make claims and invoke obligations at multiple levels. Second, several actors appear, or are invoked as authorities to be appealed or performed to for satisfaction of rights, from state bodies and individuals to banks, third sector and <b>collective</b> <b>organisations</b> and social movements. Third there is often lack of clarity over how to assert rights or engage with authorities. Two final characteristics are the loss of a perceived moral right to a secure home and a sense of betrayal. In some places, housing conflicts lead to protests and resistance as people perform this sense that political and economic elites have violated or reneged on moral obligations of intervention and / or protection. And yet, these protests are often ephemeral, ‘moments rather than movements’ (Calhoun, 2012), swiftly fracturing into the multiple moral communities and individuals who briefly conjoined. These protests may be seen as a key artefact of late capitalism linking social atomisation with a lingering sense of customary obligations...|$|E
