The occasion of this increase is fully explained, by the said Plan of the English Commerce, to be owing to the increase of the Portuguese colonies in the Brazils, and in the kingdoms of Congo and Angola {{on the west side}} of Africa; and of Melinda and the coast of Zanguebar on the east side; in all which the Portuguese have so civilized the natives and black inhabitants of the country, as to bring them, where they went even stark naked before, to clothe decently and modestly now, and to delight to do so, in such a degree as they will hardly ever be brought to go unclothed again; and all these nations are clothed more or less with our English woollen manufactures, and the same in proportion in their East India factories.|$|E

50|$|The review {{noted that}} {{numerous}} respondents to the review's <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>evidence</b> made submissions regarding the defects in copyright licensing, including the CBI, News International, Pearson, Reed Elsevier, UK photographers, and the European Publishers Council.

Market transactions needed to be faster, more automated and cheaper, in order to establish a UK market in digital copyright where disputes are readily resolved without costly litigation. Easier cross-border licensing in the EU and bulk licensing of digital content through collective rights management by collecting societies could allow the UK to build its competitive advantage and become the centre for IP matters in the European time zone, the review speculated.|$|E

The Tribunal may <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>evidence,</b> call on witnesses and generally require the evidence to be given under oath.The Tribunal adjudicates to the civil standard of proof and that is the balance of probabilities, and the tribunals focus is on assessing the parties conduct. Also the tribunal, if it considers it necessary, can dismiss any claims it considers frivolous, vexatious or not brought in good faith. Every decision that grants a remedy or dismisses a claim, must be given in writing with reasons. These reasons must include, findings of fact, explanations and findings of the relevant legal issues and its conlcusions on such matters. It is important to note that the option is available to the claimant to have the Human Rights commission attempt a settlement before tribunal proceedings, and should settlement not first be attempted, it is likely the Director will not consider acting on behalf of the claimant.|$|E

This review, stimulated by <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>evidence</b> from UK-based inquiries into NHP research, takes a critical view {{in order to provide}} some important balance against papers supporting NHP research and <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> it to be expanded. We show that there is a paucity of evidence to demonstrate the positive contribution or successful translation of NHP research to human medicine, that {{there is a great deal}} of often overlooked data showing NHP research to be irrelevant, unnecessary, even hazardous to human health and to have little or no predictive value or application to human medicine. We briefly discuss the reasons why this may be so, reflect upon the consequences for future medical progress and, on the basis of our findings, suggest a more scientifically robust and promising way forward...|$|R
40|$|Social science {{researchers}} have <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>evidenced</b> based practices when implementing, delivering, and evaluating programs. One {{important component of}} these practices is to monitor program implementation. However, in experiential education and more broadly the social sciences this process is rarely assessed or evaluated; when it is assessed it is frequently resource intensive. As such, program providers have needed an implementation measurement approach more conducive to low-resource organizations. This paper introduces a self-report mechanism to measure facilitator characteristics that contribute to delivering a program as designed. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis of 121 program facilitator responses to the Facilitator Characteristics and Program Contributions Scale (FCPC) indicated that the FCPC is a valid and reliable measure of facilitator characteristics and their pro-fidelity beliefs, and thus may be a promising alternative to other resource intensive approaches to implementation assessment...|$|R
