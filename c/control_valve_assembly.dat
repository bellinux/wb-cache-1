50|$|In 2004, the {{electronics}} side was improved greatly with the introductions of Electronic Throttle Control, electronically controlled transmissions, and transient engine and transmission controls. In addition, computing power was vastly increased. A solenoid <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> <b>assembly</b> {{integrated into the}} engine valley cover contains solenoid valves that provide a pressurized oil signal to specially designed hydraulic roller lifters provided by Eaton Corp. and Delphi. These lifters disable and re-enable exhaust and intake valve operation to deactivate and reactivate engine cylinders https://web.archive.org/web/20061029082032/http://www.gm.com/company/onlygm/fuel/engine.html. Unlike the first generation system, {{only half of the}} cylinders can be deactivated. It is notable that the second generation system uses engine oil to hydraulically modulate engine valve function. As a result, the system is dependent upon the quality of the oil in the engine. As anti-foaming agents in engine oil are depleted, air may become entrained or dissolve in the oil, delaying the timing of hydraulic control signals. Similarly engine oil viscosity and cleanliness is a factor. Use of the incorrect oil type, i.e. SAE 20W40 instead of SAE 20W50, or the failure to change engine oil at factory recommended intervals can also significantly impair system performance.|$|E

50|$|The gas {{generator}} <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> was a pneumatically operated poppet-type that was spring-loaded to the closed position. The fuel and oxidizer poppets were mechanically linked by an actuator. The <b>valve</b> <b>controlled</b> {{the flow of}} propellants through the {{gas generator}} injector. When the mainstage signal was received, pneumatic pressure was applied against the gas generator <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> actuator <b>assembly</b> which moved the piston and opened the fuel poppet. During the fuel poppet opening, an actuator contacted the piston that opened the oxidizer poppet. As the opening pneumatic pressure decayed, spring loads closed the poppets.|$|R
40|$|There were 5 <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> and 2 {{manual valves}} for the liquid {{nitrogen}} distribution system {{that needed to}} be sized and procured for the upgrade. This engineering note documents the calculations done to properly size these valves. A table summarizes the valve choices. The raw calculations are attached as an appendix. The calculations jump around a bit. No effort was made to re-organize or rewrite them for the reader. The sizing calcs. on Pages 1 through 4 were first pass calcs. based on pure liquid to the valves with no attention to flashing/choking. The calcs on pages 5 through 8 then refine the calculations by considering the LN 2 to the valve inlets to be two phase with quality of 0. 032. This is a real situation if the LN 2 subcooler is out of service for use as a He cooldown heat exchanger. Also, flashing would occur for this situation and is taken into account. The end result of this refinement pushed the Cv values up by about a factor of 3 over the initial calcs. of pages 1 through 4. The results of the refined (correct) calculations pages 5 through 8 appear in the table above. The required operating Cv's are smaller than commercially available LN 2 <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> Therefore it has been decided to use Fermilab Saver type <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> <b>assemblies</b> with the <b>valve</b> bullet Cv 1 s listed above. The bullets are 100 : 1 equal percentage types and provide better control at the lower percentage of valve Cv values. See flow characteristic data and curve for these valves in appendix B. The manual valves will be commercially purchased, probably a Cryolab model CV 3 - 84 - 5 WPG 2 or CV 8 - 84 - 5 WPG 2 or CVI model V- 1060 - 050 -VJ. Pages 8 - 10 calculate a minimum required cooldown flowrate as referenced in Cryogenic Systems by Barron. This was done to be sure the valves and piping system did not choke the warm flow so much that cooldown could not be achieved. The minimum mass flow rate needed for a simultaneous, serial cooldown of the refrigerator, solenoid and VLPC system was 6. 4 g/s. This warm flow would get choked by an opening less than 0. 175 -inch in diameter. A valve with only 10 psi differential across it with this flowrate would need to be Cv= 0. 85. These numbers show that cooldown will be achievable. Firstly, the flow through these components is not serial. The flows get split and sent to vent separately. Secondly, the valves are located upstream of the heat load. And lastly, the Cv of the valves are larger than 0. 85 except for the solenoid which has a very low heat load/small flow split and the VLPC's. The VLPC flow split brings the minimal required Cv for a valve situated at the warm outlet of the LN 2 circuit to be 0. 26. I foresee no, problems cooling down the LN 2 components...|$|R
40|$|Flow <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> may {{experience}} localized cavitation {{when the local}} static pressure drops to the liquid vapor pressure. Localized damage to the valve and surrounding area can occur when the vapor cavity collapses. Valve designs that reduce cavitation are based on empirical evidence and accumulated experience, {{but there are still}} considerable cavitation problems in industry. Valve designers may use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate cavitation in flow <b>control</b> <b>valves,</b> but model validation is challenging because there are limited data of local cavitation from the valve surface. Typically, the intensity of cavitation in a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is inferred from measurements of observable side effects of cavitation such as valve noise, vibration, or damage to the <b>valve</b> <b>assembly.</b> Such an indirect approach to characterizing cavitation yields little information about the location, degree, and extent of the cavitation flow field {{that can be used in}} CFD validation studies. This study uses 3 D X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging to visualize cavitation from a 5. 1 cm diameter butterfly valve and compares the resulting vapor cloud to that predicted by CFD simulations. Qualitative comparisons reveal that the resulting cavitation structures are captured by the simulations when a small amount of non-condensable gas is introduced into the fluid and the simulations are completed in a transient mode...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDigital {{hydraulic}} valve {{system is a}} new kind of hydraulic <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> <b>assembly,</b> which has potential to save energy and improve performance of valve controlled actuators. The typical digital valve system has 4 - 6 parallel connected on/off valves per control edge totaling 16 - 24 valves in the four-way valve configuration. The flow capacities of the parallel connected valves are set according to the powers of two such {{that it is possible to}} achieve 2 N different flow rates with N valves. An alternative approach is to use equally sized valves, which means that N parallel connected valves give only N+ 1 different flow rates. This approach has several benefits, but the number of valves becomes very large. This paper shows that it is possible to implement valve assembly having 128 miniaturized valves, such that it can be installed instead of traditional CETOP 3 servo or proportional valve. Careful electromagnetic optimization and mechatronic design are used together with novel manufacturing methods and new type of power electronics. The prototype is build and experimentally studied and results show that the performance of this kind of digital valve system is superior to traditional four-way control valves in terms of response time and fault tolerance...|$|E

40|$|A fine-water-mist fire-suppression device {{has been}} {{designed}} {{so that it can}} be discharged uniformly in any orientation via a high-pressure gas propellant. Standard fire extinguishers used while slightly tilted or on their side will not discharge all of their contents. Thanks to the new design, this extinguisher can be used in multiple environments such as aboard low-gravity spacecraft, airplanes, and aboard vehicles that may become overturned prior to or during a fire emergency. Research in recent years has shown that fine water mist can be an effective alternative to Halons now banned from manufacture. Currently, NASA uses carbon dioxide for fire suppression on the International Space Station (ISS) and Halon chemical extinguishers on the space shuttle. While each of these agents is effective, they have drawbacks. The toxicity of carbon dioxide requires that the crew don breathing apparatus when the extinguishers are deployed on the ISS, and Halon use in future spacecraft has been eliminated because of international protocols on substances that destroy atmospheric ozone. A major advantage to the new system on occupied spacecraft is that the discharged system is locally rechargeable. Since the only fluids used are water and nitrogen, the system can be recharged from stores of both carried aboard the ISS or spacecraft. The only support requirement would be a pump to fill the water and a compressor to pressurize the nitrogen propellant gas. This system uses a gaseous agent to pressurize the storage container as well as to assist in the generation of the fine water mist. The portable fire extinguisher hardware works like a standard fire extinguisher with a single storage container for the agents (water and nitrogen), a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> <b>assembly</b> for manual actuation, and a discharge nozzle.

40|$|Precise {{control of}} fluid flow becomes {{increasingly}} challenging as systems and instruments are scaled down. Smaller dimensions allow smaller flow ranges, but also leave smaller margins for error in performance. Reliable and effective fabrication and assembly procedures are therefore a primary requirement for any microfluidic system, {{if it is}} to be successful in real-world applications. This thesis describes the achievements made in ongoing efforts to create miniaturized, proportional control valves for minute gas flows. In this research we focus on MEMS-based fabrication processes, as they allow high precision manufacturing of miniature devices with high paralellism. This enables higher fabrication yields, improved reliability and increased integration. We present four valve designs that can be divided into two main categories, being either based on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology or based on surface channel technology (SCT). The first group focuses on obtaining a proportional flow controller using simple, straight-forward fabrication processes with a small number of process steps, for use in an ambulant blood pressure waveform (BPW) measurement system. Two single-wafer valve designs are presented, both offering built-in capacitive sensing of the valve displacement which can be used to correct for actuator hysteresis and improve control precision. Nitrogen gas flows up to 13 g h− 1 at a pressure of 500 mbar are demonstrated in good agreement with analytical and numerical models, with leakage below 0. 1 mgh− 1 at 1 bar. Maximum throughput is estimated at 25 g h− 1 at 1 bar. A fully functional <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> <b>assembly</b> is demonstrated with integration of a miniaturized piezoelectric bimorph actuator. Time-dynamic characterization demonstrates that the control valve is suitable for high-speed flow control, with a mechanical bandwidth of 8 kHz and a frequency-independent response up to 3 kHz. The second group demonstrates two proportional control valve designs in an already existing (SCT) fabrication process, to allow integration with existing components such as flow sensors. The first valve design allows flow control from a chip inlet or outlet to a fluidic channel embedded in the silicon surface, with a flow range of > 1250 mgh- 1 at 600 mbar and a leak flow below 0. 05 mgh- 1 at 1 bar. The second valve design supports smaller flows (> 70 mgh- 1 at 200 mbar), but allows fully on-chip flow control between any two surface channels. A good fit is obtained between the measured flow profiles and analytical flow models of both valves. The valve designs aimed at the BPW monitoring system are shown to be very well suited for the aimed application, although a smaller bimorph piezo may be required to meet the demanded physical dimensions. The combination of capacitive displacement sensing with bimorph piezoelectric actuation allows for high-speed, high-precision flow control with low power usage. The SCTbased microvalves demonstrate proportional, on-chip flow control, suitable for integration with existing flow sensors. Their designs are tailored to match an existing high-resolution mass flow sensor which has a limited flow range, but the designs of both the valves and the sensor can be scaled up to increase the range...|$|E
