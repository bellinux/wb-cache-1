Results shows that: a) On dryeration of rice, the thermal management systems using increasing air temperatures in the initial stage, associated with greater rest time result in lower drying periods in the final stage, no compromising the income of whole grains without defects, nor quality industrial and technological quality; b) four hours of rest time between initial step in dryer column, and final step in bin-dryer, are insufficient for adequate diffusion of water in this step, and an expansion to twelve hours of rest time decreases all final aeration time with environment air in the dryeration of rice c) respecting the limits of thermal mass grains rice, so much higher 10 the temperature of grains in the initial stage drying, in column dryer, needed less all time for aeration in bin-dryer, the final stage dryeration, no compromising the rice quality; d) the rest time in final step presents the most striking effects on total time of drying than thermal management air dryer in the initial step in <b>continuous</b> <b>dryer</b> on drying rice, e) the parboiling has the most striking effects on the profile parameters texture, profile color and cooking than thermal management in the drying and handling time grain storage at environmental cooled temperature, and repay the texture profile parameters and increases the income of whole grains yields without defects, bulk gravimetric and volumetric, the proportion of water required and the cooking time of rice. Foram estudados as dinâmicas da secagem e os parâmetros de qualidade industrial e tecnológicos em grãos de arroz em casca com umidade próxima a 20 % e secados até 13 % pelo método de seca-aeração, utilizando secador de coluna com três manejos térmicos na etapa inicial até 16 %, com transferência para silo-secador em estudos de dois tempos de repouso na etapa final da secagem. No secador de coluna, dotado de duas câmaras originalmente uma de secagem e outra de arrefecimento, o manejo térmico do ar de secagem utilizou temperaturas de 75 ºC / 75 ºC, 100 ºC / 75 ºC e 75 ºC / 100 ºC, respectivamente nas câmaras superior e inferior. Após a etapa final da secagem os grãos foram armazenados em ambiente refrigerado a menos de 18 ºC.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) {{model for a}} <b>continuous</b> packed-bed biomass <b>dryer.</b> The model minimizes total drying costs, including both capital and operational costs, of the dryer. Heated air, which flows through a biomass bed and perforated conveyor, is used as drying gas by the dryer. We define the dryer size {{with the help of}} an experimentally-measured characteristic drying curve. The MILP model is tested in a case study where the dryer is assumed to have been installed at a Scandinavian pulp and paper mill. There are three different heat sources available for the heating of drying air: warm water at 60 °C, warm water at 80 °C and backpressure steam at the pressure of 0. 4 MPa. The results indicate that, in practice, the use of only low-temperature warm water flows for heating of drying air is the most economic method when their prices are low (below 1 € MWh- 1 in the case study). Warm water flows are usually waste heat from pulp and paper mills and their prices are low compared to the price of back-pressure steam (typically from 10 to 15 € MWh- 1). The use of steam for drying may be reasonable if the price of warm water is for some reason clearly higher than the price of a typical waste-heat stream. The MILP model presented in this work can be used for minimizing drying costs of any material (not only biomass) dried in a <b>continuous</b> packed-bed <b>dryer</b> if the characteristic drying curve of the material is available...|$|R

Protein nitrogen decreased by 3. 46 % and 4. 80 % in comparison with total protein nitrogen content in raw feathers under the pressure of 3. 0 and 3. 5 bar, respectively. The highest applied hydrolysis pressure caused the greatest loss of protein nitrogen up to 9. 52 %. Hydrothermal hydrolysis under pressure has increased in vitro protein digestibility significantly. Under pressure of 3. 0, 3. 5 and 4. 0 bar digestibility of proteins increasing from 19. 01 to 76. 39, 81. 71 and 87. 03 %, respectively.

The purpose of using a heat pump for drying of specialty crops is to dry them at lower temperature than would otherwise be possible using conventional drying techniques. Low temperature drying of specialty crops reduces the risk of loss in nutrient content and damage to physical properties which are important aspects considering their high commercial value. Heat pump drying is potentially more energy efficient since it is possible to recover latent heat from the humid dryer exhaust air. In this research, cabinet and prototype continuous bed heat pump dryers were studied. Simulation models for the heat pump dryers were developed to predict the performance of the dryer, i. e. the drying rate of the material and psychrometric conditions of the air, and also to determine the refrigerant mass flow rate and corresponding temperatures at the condenser and evaporator coils of the heat pump system, based on the psychrometirc conditions of process air inside the drying chamber. The accuracy of the predicted results is later verified with the experimental results. Chopped alfalfa was dried in a cabinet dryer in batches and by emulating the continuous bed drying using two household dehumidifiers. The reason for using alfalfa instead of specialty crops like ginseng, herbs, echinacea, feverfew, etc. was that the material and its drying properties were readily available. Also the structure of alfalfa leaves and stems {{is similar to that of}} many herbs and specialty crops. Results showed that alfalfa was dried from an initial moisture content of 70 % (wb) to a final moisture content of 10 % (wb). It was noticed that batch drying took about 4. 5 h while continuous bed drying took 4 h to dry the material. The initial weight of alfalfa in each tray was 400 g. The average air velocity inside the dryer was 0. 36 m/s. Low temperatures (30 - 45 °C) for safe drying of specialty crops were achieved experimentally. Specific moisture extraction rate was maximum when relative humidity stayed above 40 %. The household type dehumidifiers used in this study were about 50 % more efficient in recovering the latent heat from the dryer exhaust compared to the conventional dryers. It was concluded that continuous bed drying is potentially a better option than batch drying because high process air humidity ratios at the entrance of the evaporator and constant moisture extraction rate and specific moisture extraction rate values can be maintained. Simulation results for a prototype heat pump <b>continuous</b> bed <b>dryer</b> system suggested that the change in dryer inlet temperatures of the process air has an insignificant effect on drying of the material. Therefore, based on the results, it was concluded that the dryer inlet air temperature could be kept as low as 30 °C, if required, to maintain product quality. The material was dried to a safe limit of 10 % moisture content. The material mass flow rate was only 3 - 4. 5 kg/h, indicating that it might be advisable to use the heat pump dryer in combination with some other technique. ****Disk with program codes was included with the original thesis***...|$|R
40|$|Freeze drying is an important, but expensive, {{inefficient and}} time {{consuming}} {{process in the}} pharmaceutical, chemical and food processing industries. Computational techniques {{could be a very}} effective tool in predictive design and analysis of both freeze drying process and equipment. This work is an attempt at using Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) and numerical simulations as a tool for freeze drying process and equipment design. ^ Pressure control is critical in freeze dryers, keeping in view the product stability. In industrial freeze dryers, loss of pressure control can lead to loss of an entire batch. Pressure variation within the chamber could also lead to batch inhomogeneity, especially in industrial scale dryers. The low-pressure environment and the relatively small flow velocities make it difficult to quantify the flow structure experimentally. The current work presents a three-dimensional multi-species computational fluid dynamics model for vapor flow in a laboratory scale freeze-dryer validated with experimental data and analytical expressions. The model accounts for the presence of a non-condensable gas such as nitrogen or air using a continuum multi-species model. The flow structure at different sublimation rates, chamber pressures and shelf-gaps are systematically investigated. Emphasis has been placed on accurately predicting the pressure variation across the subliming front. It was found that while the pressure variation increased linearly with sublimation rate in the range of 0. 5 kg/hr/m 2 to 1. 3 kg/hr/m 2, the variation was more sensitive at shelf gaps approaching about at 2. 1 cm and negligible at gaps close to 9 cm. While the results are found to agree within 10 % of measurements made for the range of shelf gaps and sublimation rates investigated here, the analytical solution is found to be more accurate for smaller shelf gaps. The current work presents an important validation case motivating broader use of CFD in optimizing process and equipment design. ^ A critical component of the freeze drying system is the chamber to pressure duct. A well designed duct, apart from providing smooth flow and lower chamber pressures, should be able to accommodate the peak flow rates without the possibility choking. Here we use computational fluid dynamics as a tool to predict the minimum controllable chamber pressure, maximum sublimation rate, the onset of choking and to suggest better freeze dryer geometry. The main findings include an improved performance concept (IPC) that allowed 11 % improvement in the sublimation rate. The IPC offered a lower minimum controllable pressure at all sublimation rates. A maximum projected improvement because of the combined effect of lower controllable pressure and improved flow throughput is estimated at 14. 7 % for the IPC. For the lower condenser temperature, the maximum performance improvement of 8 % was observed at the 50 mTorr chamber pressure. ^ Heat transfer to the product {{is one of the most}} inefficient step in the Freeze Drying process. While a higher product temperature ensures faster sublimation, it is necessary to maintain it below the collapse temperature for product stability. A quick and reasonable accurate model could accelerate the process design cycle or at the least reduce the number of experimental runs required. Here we present a simplified unsteady heat and mass-transfer model which can be adapted for different equipments and product geometry. The model is compared against experiments, the effect of slice geometry is discussed and the application in a <b>continuous</b> freeze <b>dryer</b> is demonstrated. The model was found to accurately predict the product temperature. However the sublimation rate predictions deviated considerably form experiential studies. It is speculated that the porous structure of the dried cake could play a significant role in the sublimation rates and hence a more complicated model might be required for accurate predictions. ...|$|R
