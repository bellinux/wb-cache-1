5|$|Variations of this flag {{were used}} during the Belarusian People's Republic in 1918–1919. The white-red-white flag is still used by the Republic's government-in-exile. Lasting from 1919 until 1925, {{the flag of the}} BPR {{retained}} the white, red, white design, but with the addition of black stripes at {{the top and bottom of}} the red stripe. Between 1921 and 1939 the white-red-white flag was used by the Belarusian national movement in West Belarus (part of the Second Polish Republic), both by political organizations like the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union or the Belarusian <b>Christian</b> <b>Democracy,</b> and non-political organizations like the Belarusian Schools Society. The flag was also used by the Belarusian Special Battalion in the army of the Republic of Lithuania. After the invasion of Poland and the annexation of modern-day West Belarus in 1939 the flag was forbidden by the Soviet administration in the newly acquired territories as well.|$|E
25|$|As the Socialist Party {{moved to}} more {{moderate}} positions, {{the ranks of}} the PCI increased in numbers, and the Communist party surpassed the <b>Christian</b> <b>Democracy</b> (DC) in the European election of 1984, barely two days after Berlinguer's death, that likely drew sympathy in the population. Huge crowds attended Berlinguer's funeral. That was to be the only time the <b>Christian</b> <b>Democracy</b> was not the largest party in a nationwide election they participated in. In 1984, the Craxi government revised the 1927 Lateran Pacts with the Vatican, which concluded the role of Catholicism as Italy's state religion.|$|E

It was a big victory for Communist leader Enrico Berlinguer.|$|R
50|$|The Democratic Party of Lazio {{was founded}} on October 14, 2007 {{at the same time}} of Italian Democratic Party as a merger of various left-wing and centrist parties; its bulk was formed by the Democrats of the Left (heirs of the Italian Communist Party), Democracy is Freedom - The Daisy and Christian leftists, direct heirs of the late <b>Christian</b> <b>Democracy's</b> left.|$|R
25|$|A {{leader of}} <b>Christian</b> <b>Democracy</b> (Democrazia Cristiana, DC), Moro was {{considered}} an intellectual and a patient mediator, especially in the internal life of his party. He was kidnapped on 16 March 1978 by the Red Brigades and killed after 55 days of captivity.|$|E
25|$|Prodi's {{political}} career {{began as a}} left-of-centre reformist Christian Democrat and a disciple of Beniamino Andreatta, another economist turned politician.

5000|$|<b>Christian</b> <b>Democracy's</b> main support areas (sometimes {{known as}} [...] "vote tanks") were {{the rural areas}} in South, Center and North-East Italy, whereas the {{industrial}} North-West had more left-leaning support because of the larger working class. An interesting exception were the [...] "red regions" [...] (Emilia Romagna, Tuscany, Umbria) where the Italian Communist Party has historically had a wide support. This is considered {{a consequence of the}} particular sharecropping ("mezzadria") farming contracts used in these regions.|$|R
50|$|The Democratic Party {{was founded}} on 14 October 2007 as a merger of various centre-left parties which {{had been part of}} The Union in the 2006 general election. At {{foundation}} the majority of the PD was formed by the Democrats of the Left (heirs of the Italian Communist Party) and the largely Catholic-inspired Democracy is Freedom - The Daisy.

During his tenure, PLI abandoned the connection with the 19th century Unification of Italy ideals, and established strong ties with Confindustria, the association of Italian industrialists. In particular, Malagodi was a strong opposer of <b>Christian</b> <b>Democracy's</b> openings towards the Italian Socialist Party. This, in 1955, caused the secession of PLI's left wing, forming the Radical Party. Under Malagodi, in 1963 the party scored a record 7% in the Parliament elections.|$|R

25|$|Though the tanquetazo was unsuccessful, it was {{a turning}} point in the deteriorating {{political}} situation of Chile.

5000|$|However, both Waldensians and the Jews {{have played}} an {{important}} role in Italian politics. While there have been several Catholic-inspired parties also after <b>Christian</b> <b>Democracy's</b> dissolution in 1994 (from Italian People's Party-1994 to Democracy is Freedom, from the Christian Democratic Centre to the Union of the Centre, from Forza Italia-1994 to Forza Italia-2013, Waldensians have been usually active in [...] "secular" [...] parties, especially the Italian Socialist Party, Italian Communist Party and, more recently, the Democratic Party, which is home to former Christian Democrats too. More recently, a group of conservative Pentecostals set up the Extended Christian Pact party. Also the Jews have been active mostly in [...] "secular" [...] parties, but recently have been more divided between the Democrats and Forza Italia.|$|R
5000|$|The Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) {{found in}} 2015 that 29.0% of the {{population}} went to church, mosque, synagogue or another house of worship on a weekly basis.

25|$|The {{three main}} schisms {{suffered}} by the party between 2004 and 2006, Middle Italy (IdM), Movement for Autonomy (MpA) and <b>Christian</b> <b>Democracy</b> for the Autonomies (DCA), were led by the most vocal supporters {{of each of the}} last three factions mentioned above, respectively Marco Follini, Raffaele Lombardo and Gianfranco Rotondi. By 2010 virtually all Giovanardiani and Cuffariani had left the party through the Liberal Populars and the PID.|$|E
25|$|During his detention, Moro wrote 86 {{letters to}} the main members of <b>Christian</b> <b>Democracy,</b> his family and to Pope Paul VI. Some arrived at their addressees; others {{that had not been}} sent were later found in another base of the BR in via Monte Nevoso, Milan. In the letters Moro puts forward the {{possibility}} of negotiation for his liberation if help from his party's colleagues and of the highest figures of the Republic could be obtained.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Giovanni Galloni, former {{national}} vice-secretary of <b>Christian</b> <b>Democracy,</b> said that during {{a discussion with}} Moro about the difficulty to find the Red Brigades' bases Moro {{told him that he}} knew of the presence of US and Israeli intelligence agents infiltrated within the BR. However the information obtained was not given to the Italian investigators. He also declared that the reason of the assassination of journalist Carmine Pecorelli was the same information, perhaps coming from the United States.|$|E
50|$|The party's mission {{statement}} stresses {{the need for}} <b>Christian</b> values, non-racial <b>democracy,</b> and government inducements for personal self-reliance, while the 2004 manifesto attacked the ANC for, among other things, its alleged softness on crime, nepotism, and neglect of South African infrastructure.|$|R

40|$|Religion is {{a dynamic}} concept. It can be a means of {{supporting}} masculinist power structures {{as well as a}} means for challenging established gender hierarchies. This article therefore suggests the proposition that it is not religion as such constituting a problem for the human rights of women but the privileging of patriarchal interpretations of religion and the marginalization of progressive interpretations in many contexts, respectively. From an empirical perspective, thus, the question of the concrete conditions contributing to the ability of conservative religious actors to enforce their patriarchal views in politics and society arises. This article consults existing empirical studies on predominantly <b>Christian</b> <b>democracies</b> and Muslim societies to find answers to this question. It discusses the impact that the institutional relations between the state and religion, the significance of religion in the political party system as well as the confessional composition and the strength of religiosity in a society have on the human rights of women. The article, moreover, deals with the effect of democracy and certain rights on the promotion of women's rights in religious contexts. It demonstrates the requirement of and provides suggestions for further empirical research in this area...|$|R
