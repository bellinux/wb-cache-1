40|$|In this study, {{we look at}} {{the effects}} of the {{adoption}} of the revised IAS 1 rules, which has been in effect since January 1, 2009. The revised IAS 1 requires that all changes in equity, excluding changes in equity arising from transactions with owners, should be recognized in comprehensive income statement. Revised IAS 1 requires companies to report total comprehensive income that is a sum of net income and other comprehensive income. Total comprehensive income includes all unrealized gains and losses recognized under IFRS. Before the amendment, some of the unrealized gains and losses were shown in a statement of changes in equity but not in the income statement. We hope to answer the question whether inclusion of the components of other comprehensive income provides investors with useful information. We investigate if stock prices have an association with the components of other comprehensive income. We investigate how effective are attempts of IASB to increase the relevance of accounting information about corporate income. We hope that results from the study will be of interest to the standard-setter. In this study, we use data from annual reports and year-end reports for companies listed on the Large and Mid Cap segment at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm and that covers the years 2009 to 2011. We use two regression models to test value relevance of components of other comprehensive income. We have found some evidence that the share price statistically relates to such component of comprehensive income as the change of the fair value of <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>hedges.</b> This can also be interpreted as that the change of the fair value of <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>hedges</b> has some value relevance.

5000|$|A foreign {{exchange}} hedge (also called a FOREX hedge) is a method used by companies to eliminate or [...] "hedge" [...] their {{foreign exchange}} risk resulting from transactions in foreign currencies (see foreign exchange derivative). This is done using either the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>hedge</b> or the fair value method.

5000|$|The International Accounting Standards IAS 32 and 39 help to give further {{direction}} for the proper accounting of derivative financial instruments. IAS 32 defines a “financial instrument” as “any contract that {{gives rise to a}} financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity”. Therefore, a forward contract or option would create a financial asset for one entity and a financial liability for another. The entity required to pay the contract holds a liability, while the entity receiving the contract payment holds an asset. These would be recorded under the appropriate headings on the balance sheet of the respective companies. IAS 39 gives further instruction, stating that the financial derivatives be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet.IAS 39 defines two major types of hedges. The first is a <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>hedge,</b> defined as: “a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that (i) is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction, and (ii) could affect profit or loss”. In other words, a <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>hedge</b> is designed to eliminate the risk associated with cash transactions that can affect the amounts recorded in net income.|$|E

40|$|Measuring and {{managing}} {{exchange rate risk}} exposure is important for reducing a firm''s vulnerabilities from major exchange rate movements, which could adversely affect profit margins {{and the value of}} assets. This paper reviews the traditional types of exchange rate risk faced by firms, namely transaction, translation and economic risks, presents the VaR approach as the currently predominant method of measuring a firm''s exchange rate risk exposure, and examines the main advantages and disadvantages of various exchange rate risk management strategies, including tactical versus strategical and passive versus active hedging. In addition, it outlines a set of widely accepted best practices in managing currency risk and presents some of the main hedging instruments in the OTC and exchange-traded markets.

This association is weaker for firms that have the ability to pass input price changes through to customers. Finally, I find that investors do not immediately price the information conveyed by cash flow hedges.

40|$|We study a {{firm that}} justifies its novel use of equity {{derivatives}} as a cash-flow hedging strategy. Our purpose is to understand the challenge of translating risk management theory into managerial action. Cephalon Inc., a biotech firm, bought a large block of call options on its own stock. If the FDA approved the firm's new drug, the firm would have large cash needs, which the options were designed to meet. We analyze this stated rationale for the firm's choice, applying the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>hedging</b> concepts articulated by Froot, Scharfstein and Stein (1993). In applying the theory to practice, there are lessons for both managers and theorists. Managers consider deadweight costs of financing and of risk management, whereas theory tends to ignore the latter costs. While theory is driven by costs of external financing, managers must measure these costs to arrive at decisions and this measurement problem is severe. Cephalon's risk management decisions seem motivated as much by fluctuations in the availability and cost of external financing and by accounting considerations as by fluctuations in operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> or desired investment. Finally, even a field-based examination of this strategy cannot reject {{the conclusion that the}} transaction was motivated by goals other than risk management. ...|$|R
