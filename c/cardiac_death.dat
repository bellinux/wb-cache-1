25|$|Billman's {{research}} has focused on cardiovascular function, in particular its role in the induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF). He developed non-invasive methods to study autonomic neural regulation of the heart, using a canine model of sudden <b>cardiac</b> <b>death</b> (SCD). These techniques have subsequently been used in human patients to identify people at high risk for VF. Billman has used his sudden <b>cardiac</b> <b>death</b> models to study the effects of exercise training on susceptibility to SCD and the effects of omega-3 fatty acids, among other things. Due to his use of live animals in experiments, Billman has been criticized by animal rights activists; a 2009 regulatory investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing.|$|E

25|$|Most organ {{donation}} for organ transplantation {{is done in}} the setting of brain death. However, in Japan this is a fraught point, and prospective donors may designate either brain death or <b>cardiac</b> <b>death</b> – see organ transplantation in Japan.

25|$|Statins are {{effective}} in decreasing mortality in people with pre-existing CVD. They are also advocated for use in patients {{at high risk of}} developing heart disease.

40|$|Abstract Background More {{people die}} in the winter from cardiac disease, and there are {{competing}} hypotheses to explain this. The authors conducted a study in 48 US cities {{to determine how much}} of the seasonal pattern in <b>cardiac</b> <b>deaths</b> could be explained by influenza epidemics, whether that allowed a more parsimonious control for season than traditional spline models, and whether such control changed the short term association with temperature. Methods The authors obtained counts of daily <b>cardiac</b> <b>deaths</b> and of emergency hospital admissions of the elderly for influenza during 1992 – 2000. Quasi-Poisson regression models were conducted estimating the association between daily cardiac mortality, and temperature. Results Controlling for influenza admissions provided a more parsimonious model with better Generalized Cross-Validation, lower residual serial correlation, and better captured Winter peaks. The temperature-response function was not greatly affected by adjusting for influenza. The pooled estimated increase in risk for a temperature decrease from 0 to − 5 °C was 1. 6 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 1 - 2. 1 %). Influenza accounted for 2. 3 % of <b>cardiac</b> <b>deaths</b> over this period. Conclusions The results suggest that including epidemic data explained most of the irregular seasonal pattern (about 18 % of the total seasonal variation), allowing more parsimonious models than when adjusting for seasonality only with smooth functions of time. The effect of cold temperature is not confounded by epidemics. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} utilize {{terminal}} stored intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) {{to study the}} electrophysiologic events that accompany mortality in patients with third-generation implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). Background. Despite their ability to effectively terminate ventricular tachyarrhythmias, cardiac mortality in patients with ICDs remains high. The mechanisms and modes of death in these patients are not well understood. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed clinical data and stored EGMs from patients enrolled in the clinical trial of the Ventritex Cadence ICD. Of the 1, 729 patients 119 died during 6 years of follow-up. The final recorded EGM was reviewed. Postimplant EGMs as well as 50 control EGMs were used to define normal EGM characteristics. Results. There were 36 noncardiac deaths (30 %) and 83 <b>cardiac</b> <b>deaths</b> (70 %). Of the <b>cardiac</b> <b>deaths,</b> 55 (66 %) were nonsudden and 28 (34 %) were sudden. When <b>cardiac</b> <b>deaths</b> were analyzed, 46 (55 %) had no stored EGMs within 1 h of death, implying that the deaths were {{not directly related to}} tachyarrhythmias. In 37 <b>cardiac</b> <b>deaths</b> (18 nonsudden, 19 sudden), stored EGMs were present within 1 h of death. In these 37 deaths, the final EGM recorded was wide (> 158 ms) in 33 (89 %). Wide EGMs were interpreted as ventricular tachycardia in 27 and ventricular fibrillation in 6. In 13 of the 33 patients (39 %) with wide EGMs, therapy was not delivered by the ICD, as it incorrectly detected a spontaneous termination of the arrhythmia. EGMs were significantly wider if recorded within 1 h, as compared with those recorded from 1 to 48 h before death (261 ± 124 vs. 181 ± 93 ms, p = 0. 04). Conclusions. Only 37 patients (31 %) who died after placement of an ICD had a stored EGM within 1 h of the time of death, suggesting that the majority of deaths (69 %) were not the immediate result of a tachyarrhythmia. When EGMs were recorded, they were wide in 89 % of patients. These wide EGMs most likely represent intracardiac recordings of electromechanical dissociation. Thus, of the 119 deaths, 112 (94 %) were not the immediate result of a tachyarrhythmia...|$|R
