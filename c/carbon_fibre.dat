40|$|In this {{research}} {{the effect of}} several parameters such as weight percent, length, dis-tance and orientation of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> on microwave attenuating of polymeric coatingshave been investigated and microwave attenuating behaviour of these composite coatings were evaluated in frequency range of 8 - 12 GHz (X-bond). The optimum length of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> {{was found to be}} about one-half of the wavelength of incident radiation.

40|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> {{are leading}} {{reinforcements}} in composite materials {{because of their}} outstanding mechanical and physical properties. However, the graphitic surface of these fibres is relatively inert, and the weak interaction between the <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> and the polymeric matrix has negative consequences for the mechanical properties of composite materials. Surface treatments {{have been used to}} increase the surface roughness, remove contaminants or weakly bonded layers, and to alter the surface chemistry and wettability of the fibres. In this article, the authors review the effect of the microstructure on the response of the <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> to the surface treatments.

5|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used {{in a number of}} applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.|$|E
5|$|The car was {{initially}} designed in 1979 as a short notice {{replacement for the}} team's Alfa Romeo-engined BT48, after Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone decided to end {{his relationship with the}} Italian engine manufacturer. The BT49 was created in only six weeks using elements of the BT48 chassis together with the widely used Cosworth DFV engine. It is a single seater with an open cockpit and exposed wheels. The monocoque chassis is made from aluminium alloy and <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> composites. The car was fitted with controversial hydropneumatic suspension and water-cooled brakes at different points in its life.|$|E
5|$|The variable-quality cement {{which had}} been used in the {{construction}} of the Causeway bridges meant that by the early 2000s, they had suffered significant damage, leading to a repair contract being awarded to Kulin Group in 2004. Localised patching of cracks in the piers was undertaken. At the ends of the piers, the cracking was more substantial and had to be tied back with <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforcement. Repairs were then coated with moisture-resistant coating, and were expected to lengthen the life of the bridges by decades.|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} UV-Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{to study the}} sp 3 structure in polyacrylonitrile- and pitch-based <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> with Young’s modulus values {{in the range of}} 90 - 830 GPa. The composite microstructure of these <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> comprises an amorphous carbon phase that transfers the load to a reinforcing graphite crystalline phase. The intensity ratio of the T, D and G Raman bands showed that the low modulus polyacrylonitrile-based <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> (Young’s modulus= 200 - 300 GPa) contained 10 - 25 % sp 3 carbon, whereas the stiffer polyacrylonitrile-based <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> (Young’s modulus > 350 GPa) contained ∼ 5 % sp 3 material. This result suggests that the proportion of sp 3 carbon decreases as the amorphous structure is converted into a crystalline structure during the carbonization treatment, leading to the high performance fibres. This observation is consistent with our current understanding of the relationship between structure and mechanical properties in <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R

5|$|Pistorius uses {{custom-made}} spike pads on the blades. Before {{development of}} the pads, his spikes were changed by roughing up the surface and applying over-the-counter spikes by hand, but the results using this method were inconsistent. Research was conducted in Össur’s Iceland lab using a pressure-sensitive treadmill and film at 500 fps to measure the blade strike, and produced a spike pad which includes a midsole of two machine-molded pieces of foam of different densities to cushion impact, with a <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> plate on the bottom. The developers attached the pad with contact cement, which can be quickly removed with the application of heat when the spike pad needs to be changed.|$|E
5|$|The current Causeway bridges were {{designed}} by E W C Godfrey, and built between 1947 and 1952. They were the first in Western Australia to use steel composite construction. Large roundabouts were also constructed {{at each end of}} the structure, to improve the flow of traffic. The opening of the Graham Farmer Freeway in 2000 reduced the traffic volume on the Causeway, allowing the two central lanes to be turned into bus lanes. By the early 2000s, the concrete structures had suffered significant damage. Cracks were repaired using <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforcement and localised patching, extending the bridge's life by decades. The Causeway bridges have been recognised for their heritage value by their entry on the Western Australian Register of Heritage Places.|$|E

30|$|Both {{the inner}} and the outer surface of the implant {{retrieved}} from the human body were covered by a 15 – 17 -μm-thick cracked layer, below which the <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> were still visible.

40|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> were pretreated {{by means}} of an {{interfacial}} in-situ polyamidation technique resulting in a polyamide coating of the fibres. The procedure followed involved successive application to the <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> of two immiscible solutions of hexamethylenediamine and adipoyl chloride. Previous work conducted in our laboratory on chrysotile/epoxy composites coated with Nylon 6, 6 provided interesting results when the tensile performance was evaluated. This behaviour was attributed to the improved affinity between matrix and asbestos fibres {{as a result of the}} well-known compatibility between polyamide and the epoxy phase. In this study emphasis is given to the coating of long <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> such as are used for the preparation of unidirectional carbon/epoxy composites. The mechanical properties of uniaxial laminates with varying fibre volume fractions and polyamide contents are then compared with those of uncoated <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres.</b> © 1993...|$|R
5|$|Further {{complicating the}} sales {{situation}} was the announcement by JaguarSport of a road-going {{version of the}} Jaguar XJR-9, {{the last of the}} racing cars to feature the Jaguar V12 engine. The Jaguar XJR-15 was developed by TWR and styled by Peter Stevens whilst the XJ220 was being developed at Jaguar, and featured the V12 engine {{and a host of other}} technologies not adopted for the XJ220, including <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> construction and the option of a six-speed racing gearbox. It was considerably rarer and more expensive than the XJ220 when it went on sale; only 50 were built, each with a list price of £600,000 ($1 million) in 1990. It was designed primarily for racing but could be specified as a road-legal vehicle. About half were built as road-going variants, which added £55,000 to the list price.|$|E
5|$|Juan Pablo Montoya {{started from}} pole {{position}} alongside Ralf Schumacher. Michael Schumacher, the eventual Drivers' Champion started fourth, behind Mika Häkkinen of McLaren. The race {{was marked by}} an airborne accident going into the first corner involving Michael Schumacher and Luciano Burti for Prost, which caused the track to be scattered with shreds of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> and the race restarted as a result. Both Williams drivers retained their positions {{at the end of}} the first lap, with Michael Schumacher passing Häkkinen for third. Over the course of the race, Montoya extended a considerable lead over Ralf Schumacher. Montoya lost the lead on lap 24 when an issue with a refulling rig caused him to be stationary for more than 20 seconds. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead and held it to win his third victory of the season.|$|E
5|$|On lap 25, a man {{appeared}} {{beside the}} barriers of the circuit on the straight heading towards turn 2. He {{ran across the}} track to avoid being caught by marshals. The incident prompted the deployment of the safety car. Teams immediately brought their drivers into the pit lane {{to take advantage of}} the scenario with Trulli and de la Rosa the first to make pit stops. McLaren called in Häkkinen to the pit lane on lap 27 and Coulthard remained out on worn tyres. The Scot pitted on the following lap and emerged in sixth place. On the same lap, the man was caught and escorted off the circuit. Racing resumed on lap 29 when the safety car pulled into the pit lane. Trulli immediately came under pressure from Barrichello and withstood the Brazilian's attempts to pass him. Ralf Schumacher spun at turn 3 on lap thirty and Verstappen was forced wide in avoidance.
