5|$|Charles Ssekyaaya participated on Uganda's behalf in the men's 62 {{kilogram}} weightlifting discipline. He was 18 {{years old}} and had not participated in any previous Olympic Games. Ssekyaaya qualified for the Games after receiving a wildcard from the International Weightlifting Federation after achieving a 28th-place finish in the Africa Olympic Qualifiers. His event took place on 31 July, and included 14 athletes in total. During the event's snatch phase, Ssekyaaya was given three attempts. He successfully attempted to lift over 90 kilograms of weight in his first two attempts, but did not achieve this objective on the third attempt. Ssekyaaya then attempted 130 kilograms during the <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> jerk phrase of the event, successfully lifting it on his first attempt. He did not succeed in lifting 135 kilograms on his second attempt, or 140 on his third. Overall, the combination of Ssekyaaya's highest scores in snatch (105) and <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> jerk (130) yielded a score of 235 points. He ranked 13th in the event, ahead of Stevick Patris from Palau (234 points) and behind Tuau Lapua Lapua of Tuvalu (243 points). Ssekyaaya was 92 points behind the gold medallist Kim Un-guk from North Korea.|$|E

While hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used for severe poisonings, the benefit over standard oxygen delivery is unclear. The risk of death among those affected is between 1 and 30%.|$|E

5|$|Logona Esau {{qualified}} for weightlifting via {{an invitation from}} the Tripartite commission. He represented Tuvalu as its first weightlifter, and its only competitor in the sport at the Beijing Games. He competed in the lightweight class.

5|$|Manuel Minginfel was {{the only}} {{weightlifter}} at the Beijing Olympics who competed {{under the banner of}} the Federated States of Micronesia. He participated in the men's featherweight class, which includes athletes of 62kilograms and below. Born in Yap, Minginfel was 21 years old when he first competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Although he was unable to successfully lift any snatches at those games, Minginfel finished in his event when at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, at 25 years old. The Micronesian athlete was 29 years old {{when he returned to the}} Olympics for the third time in 2008.

His final score, which combines his highest lifted weight from the snatch and <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> jerk categories, was 275kilograms. Of the 12 athletes who finished the event, Minginfel ranked 11th ahead of Canadian weightlifter Jasvir Singh (266kilograms) and behind Henadzy Makhveyenia of Belarus (278kilograms). In comparison, gold medalist Zhang Xiangxiang of China lifted a combined total of 319kilograms.|$|E
5|$|Meanders are sinuous bends in rivers {{or other}} channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As {{soon as the}} path is {{slightly}} curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as helical flow drags material like sand and gravel across the river {{to the inside of}} the bend. The outside of the loop is left <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> unprotected, so erosion accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful positive feedback loop.|$|E

5|$|Oral hygiene is the {{practice}} of keeping the mouth <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> {{is a means of}} preventing dental caries, gingivitis, periodontal disease, bad breath, and other dental disorders. It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular cleanings, usually done by dentists and dental hygienists, remove tartar (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.|$|E
5|$|Production {{processes}} for {{primary and secondary}} lead are similar.

Given adequate techniques, secondary lead is indistinguishable from primary lead. Scrap lead from the building trade is usually fairly <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> is re-melted without the need for smelting, though refining is sometimes needed. Secondary lead production is therefore cheaper, in terms of energy requirements, than is primary production, often by 50% or more.|$|E
