50|$|<b>Cefuzonam</b> (INN) is a second-generation {{cephalosporin}} antibiotic.|$|E
50|$|Third-generation {{cephalosporins}} {{differ from}} earlier generations {{in the presence}} of a C=N-OCH3 group in their chemical structure (cefuroxime & <b>Cefuzonam</b> also bear this functional group but are only listed as class II). This group provides improved stability against certain beta-lactamase enzymes produced by Gram-negative bacteria. These bacterial enzymes rapidly destroy earlier-generation cephalosporins by breaking open the drug's beta-lactam chemical ring, leading to antibiotic resistance. Though initially active against these bacteria, with widespread use of third-generation cephalosporins, some Gram-negative bacteria known as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are even able to inactivate the third-generation cephalosporins. Infections caused by ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria are of particular concern in hospitals and other healthcare facilities.|$|E
40|$|DQ- 2556 is a {{recently}} developed cephalosporin {{with a broad}} spectrum of antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Its in vitro activity was roughly comparable to those of <b>cefuzonam</b> and cefpirome and greater than those of ceftazidime, cefepime, and cefclidin against gram-positive bacteria. Against gram-negative bacteria, DQ- 2556 showed almost the same activity as those shown by cefpirome and cefepime. The activity was largely unaffected by culture medium pH or the addition of human serum. The protective effect of DQ- 2556 in experimental gram-positive pathogen and Escherichia coli infections in mice was greater than those of ceftazidime, <b>cefuzonam,</b> cefepime, and cefclidin and was similar to that of cefpirome. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus infections, DQ- 2556 was more active than <b>cefuzonam</b> and had activity similar to or less than those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and cefclidin. When cells of E. coli were exposed to various concentrations of DQ- 2556, filamentous cells were observed at concentrations of 0. 0008 micrograms/ml and greater, spheroplasts started to form at 0. 025 micrograms/ml, and subsequent cell lysis was observed. The affinity of DQ- 2556 to PBP 3 of E. coli, which participates in septum formation, as suggested by morphological observation, was two times greater than that of ceftazidime. DQ- 2556 also had high affinities for PBPs 1 B and 1 A of E. coli. These results suggest that DQ- 2556 is worthy for subsequent clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Fifteen {{beta-lactam}} antibiotics {{were divided}} into four classes based on their antibacterial actions and beta-lactamase-inducing activities in Proteus vulgaris. One of these groups, which included cefmenoxime, ceftriaxone, <b>cefuzonam,</b> and cefotaxime, showed a clear paradoxical antibacterial activity against P. vulgaris. This group showed growth-inhibitory activity at relatively low concentrations, up to certain limits. These cephalosporins have, as a common moiety, an aminothiazolyl-oxyimino group in the 7 -acyl side chain and have high beta-lactamase-inducing activities and low stabilities against the beta-lactamase. In a mutant strain incapable of inducing beta-lactamase, however, the paradoxical antibacterial activity was not observed. These findings suggest that beta-lactamase plays {{an essential role in}} the paradoxical antibacterial effect in P. vulgaris. We conclude that the induction of a large amount of beta-lactamase and the low stability against beta-lactamase may account for the paradoxical antibacterial activity in P. vulgaris...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of MUELLER-HINTON (MH) broth (from BBL Microbiology Systems, and Difco Laboratories) of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of <b>cefuzonam</b> (CZON), flomoxef (FMOX), imipenem (IPM), and minocycline (MINO) for 100 strains of Staphylococcus aureus was investigated. Antibacterial activity of MINO {{was stronger than}} any other antibiotics. MICs of CZON for 16 strains (14 of 50 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 2 of 50 methicillin-sensitive S. aureus) were ≥ 4 -fold greater when tested in BBL MH broth than when tested in Difco MH broth, thus, different media altered categories of some strains (8 of 50 MRSA) from susceptible to resistant. MICs of FMOX in the BBL MH broth for 12 of 50 MRSA strains rose ≥ 4 -fold compared to the Difco MH broth. On the other hand, MICs of IPM and MINO were affected very little by the different brand of MH broth used...|$|E
40|$|Many {{cephalosporin}} antibiotics {{have recently}} been invented and {{attempts have been made}} to use them clinically. The choice of which of these drugs should be used has been difficult in gynecology. The efficacies of these drugs depend on their antibacterial spectra, potencies, and concentrations in tissues. This study was designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of various cephem antibiotics in the exudate of the retroperitoneal space that is formed after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. These cephem antibiotics were cefoxitin, cefotiam, cefotetan, cefpiramide, cefminox, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefoperazone, cefmenoxime, cefbuperazone, ceftazidime, cefpimizole, flomoxef, and <b>cefuzonam.</b> The maximum concentrations after administration of a 1 -g dose in the exudate of the pelvic retroperitoneal space were 37. 9 micrograms/ml with cefminox, 30. 3 micrograms/ml with cefpimizole, 21. 6 micrograms/ml with flomoxef, 21. 5 micrograms/ml with ceftazidime, and 17. 6 micrograms/ml with cefbuperazone, which were relatively high. When selecting antibiotics for prophylactic use against infections in the retroperitoneal space after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, on the basis of drug transfer, flomoxef, cefminox, cefbuperazone, ceftazidime, and cefpimizole were considered to be the drugs of first choice at a dose of 1 g...|$|E
40|$|E 1077 {{is a novel}} {{parenteral}} cephalosporin with a {{wide spectrum}} of potent antibacterial activity against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, E 1077 was twice as active as cefpirome, with an MIC for 90 % of strains tested (MIC 90) of 0. 78 micrograms/ml. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was moderately to highly resistant to E 1077, but E 1077 was at least twice as active as other beta-lactams tested. Against Enterococcus faecalis, E 1077 was the most active of the cephalosporins tested (MIC 90, 12. 5 micrograms/ml) and was at least fourfold more active than cefpirome and ceftazidime. At concentrations of {{less than or equal to}} 0. 78 micrograms/ml, E 1077 inhibited 90 % of streptococci and most of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested, with the exceptions of Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris, for which the MIC 90 s of E 1077 were both 3. 13 micrograms/ml. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E 1077 was two- to fourfold more active than cefpirome and ceftazidime. For the anaerobes, E 1077 was as active against Bacteroides fragilis as was <b>cefuzonam,</b> and its activity was fourfold higher than those of cefpirome and ceftazidime. E 1077 was at least as resistant as cefpirome to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases, and these enzymes had a low affinity for E 1077...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} protein binding in serum of eight cephem {{antibiotics}} (ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefpiramide, cefazolin, <b>cefuzonam,</b> ceftriaxone) on their therapeutic efficacies was examined in mice with experimentally induced intraperitoneal infections or pneumonia. The relationship among therapeutic activity, in vitro antibacterial activity, total or free (unbound) levels in serum, and homogenized whole lung levels was investigated. In the intraperitoneal infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae, the 50 % effective doses (ED 50 s) of the cephem antibiotics {{correlated with the}} area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values of free levels in serum and the MICs but not with those of total levels in serum. A linear relationship was seen between 1 /ED 50 values and AUC of free levels in serum/MIC values. On the other hand, in mice with pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae, the number of bacteria in the lung closely correlated with the AUC of the antibiotic concentration in lung tissue. There was a direct correlation between the levels in lung tissue and total levels in serum but not free levels in serum. The cephem antibiotics tested {{in this study were}} bound only slightly to homogenates of mouse lung. These results indicate that the effect of protein binding in serum on therapeutic efficacy against intraperitoneal infection differs from that against pulmonary infection...|$|E
40|$|E 1077, a new {{injectable}} cephalosporin {{with a broad}} antibacterial {{spectrum and}} potent antibacterial activity, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with those of cefpirome, <b>cefuzonam,</b> ceftazidime, and cefotaxime. E 1077 showed broad in vitro antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, E 1077 was as active as cefpirome; the MIC for 90 % of strains tested (MIC 90) was 1. 0 microgram/ml. Against methicillin-resistant S. aureus, E 1077 was less active (MIC 90, 64 micrograms/ml). For Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E 1077 was fourfold more active than cefpirome, with MIC 90 s of 1. 0 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively. For Proteus vulgaris, the MIC 90 of E 1077 was 32 micrograms/ml, which was fourfold {{greater than that of}} cefpirome. Against other gram-negative strains tested, the in vitro activity of E 1077 was comparable to that of cefpirome. The broad antibacterial spectrum of E 1077 was reflected by its in vivo efficacy against experimental septicemia caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Against S. aureus 90 and P. aeruginosa E 7, E 1077 had activity superior to those of the reference compounds; against most other bacterial strains, the efficacy of E 1077 was similar to that of cefpirome. Levels of E 1077 in plasma and tissue of mice were studied. At 15 min after a single subcutaneous administration, E 1077 displayed high peak levels (mean, 31. 8 +/- 3. 1 micrograms/ml). These results indicate that the in vitro and in vivo efficacies of E 1077 {{are similar to those of}} cefpirome except against P. aeruginosa and P. vulgaris...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli TUM 1083, {{which is}} {{resistant}} to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, piperacillin, <b>cefuzonam,</b> and aztreonam while being sensitive to cefoxitin, moxalactam, cefmetazole, ceftazidime, and imipenem, was {{isolated from the}} urine of a patient treated with β-lactam antibiotics. The β-lactamase (Toho- 2) purified from the bacteria hydrolyzed β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin G, carbenicillin, cephaloridine, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and aztreonam and especially had increased relative hydrolysis rates for cephalothin, cephaloridine, cefotaxime, and ceftizoxime. Different from other extended-spectrum β-lactamases, Toho- 2 was inhibited 16 -fold better by the β-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam than by clavulanic acid. Resistance to β-lactams was transferred by conjugation from E. coli TUM 1083 to E. coli ML 4909, and the transferred plasmid was about 54. 4 kbp, belonging to the incompatibility group IncFII. The cefotaxime resistance gene for Toho- 2 was subcloned from the 54. 4 -kbp plasmid. The sequence of the gene was determined, and the open reading frame of the gene was found to consist of 981 bases. The nucleotide sequence of the gene (DDBJ accession no. D 89862) designated as blatoho {{was found to have}} 76. 3 % identity to class A β-lactamase CTX-M- 2 and 76. 2 % identity to Toho- 1. It has 55. 9 % identity to SHV- 1 β-lactamase and 47. 5 % identity to TEM- 1 β-lactamase. Therefore, the newly isolated β-lactamase designated as Toho- 2 produced by E. coli TUM 1083 is categorized as an enzyme similar to Toho- 1 group β-lactamases rather than to mutants of TEM or SHV enzymes. According to the amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence, the precursor consisted of 327 amino acid residues. Comparison of Toho- 2 with other β-lactamase (non-Toho- 1 group) suggests that the substitutions of threonine for Arg- 244 and arginine for Asn- 276 are important for the extension of the substrate specificity...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli TUH 12191, {{which is}} {{resistant}} to piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotiam, ceftizoxime, <b>cefuzonam,</b> and aztreonam but {{is susceptible to}} cefoxitin, latamoxef, flomoxef, and imipenem, was isolated from the urine of a patient treated with beta-lactam antibiotics. The beta-lactamase (Toho- 1) purified from the bacteria had a pI of 7. 8, had a molecular weight of about 29, 000, and hydrolyzed beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin G, ampicillin, oxacillin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and aztreonam. Toho- 1 was markedly inhibited by beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid and tazobactam. Resistance to beta-lactams, streptomycin, spectinomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim was transferred by conjugational transfer from E. coli TUH 12191 to E. coli ML 4903, and the transferred plasmid was about 58 kbp, belonging to incompatibility group M. The cefotaxime resistance gene for Toho- 1 was subcloned from the 58 -kbp plasmid by transformation of E. coli MV 1184. The sequence of the gene for Toho- 1 was determined, and the open reading frame of the gene consisted of 873 or 876 bases (initial sequence, ATGATG). The nucleotide sequence of the gene (DDBJ accession number D 37830) {{was found to be}} about 73 % homologous to the sequence of the gene encoding a class A beta-lactamase produced by Klebsiella oxytoca E 23004. According to the amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence, the precursor consisted of 290 or 291 amino acid residues, which contained amino acid motifs common to class A beta-lactamases (70 SXXK, 130 SDN, and 234 KTG). Toho- 1 was about 83 % homologous to the beta-lactamase mediated by the chromosome of K. oxytoca D 488 and the beta-lactamase mediated by the plasmid of E. coli MEN- 1. Therefore, the newly isolated beta-lactamase Toho- 1 produced by E. coli TUH 12191 is similar to beta-lactamases produced by K. oxytoca D 488, K. oxytoca E 23004, and E. coli MEN- 1 rather than to mutants of TEM or SHV enzymes. Toho- 1 has shown the highest degree of similarity to K. oxytoca class A beta-lactamase. Detailed comparison of Toho- 1 with other beta-lactamases implied that replacement of Asn- 276 by Arg with the concomitant substitution of Thr for Arg- 244 is an important mutation in the extension of the substrate specificity...|$|E
