40|$|Homewood is an unincorporated {{community}} in Placer County, California, {{located on the}} west shore of Lake Tahoe. The ski resort, located a few miles south of Tahoe City, has approximately 1, 200 acres of skiable terrain with views of Lake Tahoe. The resort experiences around 400 inches of snow precipitation a year and has about 300 days of sunny weather a year. Ellis Peak shields the resort from the high winds created by storms coming over the Sierra Crest. The Project area is situated with TRPA Plan Area Statements (PAS) 157 – Homewood/Ski Homewood Area, 158 – McKinney Tract, and 159 – Homewood/Commercial. Recreation opportunities in the Project area are mostly associated with Homewood Mountain Resort (HMR). Beyond downhill alpine skiing, the Project area includes cross-country skiing trails, hiking and mountain bike trails for summer use, and fishing at Quail Lake. Adjacent to the Project area, recreation opportunities are available on USDA Forest Service (USFS) Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU) lands and waters of Lake Tahoe. A <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> <b>Bike</b> <b>Route,</b> a roadway with shoulder and bike route signage, {{owned and operated by}} Tahoe City Public Utility District (TCPUD) and identified by the Lake Tahoe Bicycle Coalition on their bike trails map, parallels SR 89 through the Project area. The trail serves up to 400 bicyclists and 100 pedestrians per day. User surveys north of Homewood recorded an average of 93 bicyclists per hour i...|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} types of bike lanes on New York City streets: Class I, Class II and <b>Class</b> <b>III.</b> <b>Class</b> I <b>bike</b> lanes are {{typically}} physically separated from vehicular/pedestrian paths. Class II bike lanes are simply marked with paint and signage, and lie between a parking lane and a traffic lane. <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> <b>bike</b> lanes are shared vehicular/bike lanes, usually only marked by signage. The majority of bike lanes in New York are Class II or <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> <b>bike</b> lanes.|$|R
50|$|Most cycling is in Class II or <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> <b>bike</b> lanes, {{since most}} streets provide no {{separate}} facilities for bicycles. However, Class I bike lanes connect most neighborhoods. Those are in parks and Greenways, segregated from traffic. The Hudson River Greenway is so heavily used {{that it requires}} separation of the bikeway from pedestrians. Other parts of the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway and the Brooklyn-Queens Greenway are less continuously segregated. An east-west Greenway runs through Pelham Bay Park and across the Bronx along Mosholu Parkway to Van Cortlandt Park where it connects to the South County Trailway. Others include foreshoreways along {{the north shore of}} Jamaica Bay, the south shores of Little Neck Bay and Flushing Bay and other locations.|$|R
5000|$|New York City Department of Transportation {{distributes}} a {{free and}} annually updated bike map [...] through bike shops. The map shows Class I bike lanes in green, and <b>Class</b> II/Class <b>III</b> <b>bike</b> lanes in other colors. It shows the locations and names of bike shops and points of touristic interest. Shops that rent bikes are shown in red.|$|R
50|$|Being doored (colliding {{with the}} door of a car {{unexpectedly}} opened) is a prominent hazard. Many <b>Class</b> II/Class <b>III</b> <b>bike</b> lanes run in the door zone. While the law requires caution in opening car doors into traffic lanes, dooring remains common, and doored cyclists face injury and sometimes death. Cyclists must exercise caution, riding a door's length away from parked cars whenever practicable.|$|R
5000|$|As of February 2009, about 170 mi of Class II bike lanes run in streets, and {{the network}} is growing. Class II and <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> <b>bike</b> lanes are often blocked by trucks {{unloading}} and by double parked cars. A few, as in the westernmost block of Tillary Street between Adams Street and Cadman Plaza West in Brooklyn, replace the parking lane and are separated from motor traffic by concrete barriers. The 8th and 9th Avenue bike lanes in Chelsea, Manhattan were rebuilt in late 2008 as Class II bike lanes between the curb and a new parking lane, {{and are expected to}} provide more safety. [...] Similar layouts were used in the reconstructions of 1st and 2nd Avenues in 2010, and in that of Columbus Avenue in 2011.|$|R

40|$|The Boulder Bay {{project site}} {{is located in}} the Nevada portion of the TRPA’s North Stateline Community Plan (NSCP) area (TRPA et al. 1996). A small portion of the project site is {{situated}} in TRPA’s Crystal Bay Plan Area (PAS 034) (TRPA 2008). Boulder Bay is situated within the Tahoe Area Plan (TAP) (Washoe County 2006). The NSCP and TAP are detailed planning areas within the Washoe County Comprehensive Plan (WCCP) (Washoe County 1994). The Crystal Bay Plan Area is located along Highway 28 between the NSCP area and Incline Village, and contains a low-density residential area. The Crystal Bay Plan Area is considered a sensitive viewshed and high hazard area at risk of avalanche, soil erosion, and slope failure (TRPA 2008). Outdoor recreational opportunities in the 48 -acre NSCP area are limited to the Cal Neva Lodge pool and tennis courts, and the area lacks recreational bicycle and pedestrian trails (TRPA et al. 1996). Placer County recently constructed Class II Bike Lanes on each side of SR 28 that terminate at the Stateline. Signed <b>Class</b> <b>III</b> <b>Bike</b> Paths are signed on each side of SR 28 through the casino core area of Washoe County. The TAP includes 19, 165 acres of Washoe County in the Lake Tahoe Basin. The TAP area includes 4, 537 acres of park and recreation facilities and 8, 612 acres of open space, comprising 24 % and 45 % of the area, respectively (Washoe County 2006). Open space includes U. S. Forest Service lands and portions of Lake Tahoe Nevada State Park, which includes Sand Harbor (Washoe County 2006). Washoe County plans and manages regional parks, special use facilities, and community parks in coordination with state, federal, and local agencies. Two administrative agencies of Washoe County manage the neighborhood and/or community park system in the TAP area: The Incline Village Genera...|$|R

50|$|As of 2008, San Francisco had 23 {{miles of}} streets with bike paths (Class I), 45 miles of streets with bike lanes (Class II), and 132 miles of streets with <b>bike</b> <b>routes</b> (<b>Class</b> <b>III).</b> Almost {{all of the}} bike paths are located in parks on the extreme {{western edge of the}} city: the Presidio, Lincoln Park, Golden Gate Park, and Fort Funston Park.
