25|$|Lactose {{is also a}} {{commercial}} food additive used for its texture, flavor, and adhesive qualities. It is found in additives labelled as casein, <b>caseinate,</b> whey, lactoserum, milk solids, modified milk ingredients, etc. As such lactose is found in foods such as processed meats (sausages/hot dogs, sliced meats, pâtés), gravy stock powder, margarines, sliced breads, breakfast cereals, potato chips, processed foods, medications, prepared meals, meal replacements (powders and bars), protein supplements (powders and bars), and even beers in the milk stout style. Some barbecue sauces and liquid cheeses used in fast-food restaurants may also contain lactose. Lactose is often used as the primary filler (main ingredient) in most prescription and non-prescription solid pill form medications, though product labeling seldom mentions the presence of 'lactose' or 'milk', and neither do product monograms provided to pharmacists, and most pharmacists are unaware of the very wide scale yet common use of lactose in such medications until they contact the supplier or manufacturer for verification.|$|E
25|$|The {{isoelectric point}} (pI) is the pH of a {{solution}} at which the net primary charge of a protein becomes zero. At a solution pH that is above the pI {{the surface of the}} protein is predominantly negatively charged and therefore like-charged molecules will exhibit repulsive forces. Likewise, at a solution pH that is below the pI, the surface of the protein is predominantly positively charged and repulsion between proteins occurs. However, at the pI the negative and positive charges cancel, repulsive electrostatic forces are reduced and the attraction forces predominate. The attraction forces will cause aggregation and precipitation. The pI of most proteins is in the pH range of 4–6. Mineral acids, such as hydrochloric and sulfuric acid are used as precipitants. The greatest disadvantage to isoelectric point precipitation is the irreversible denaturation caused by the mineral acids. For this reason isoelectric point precipitation is most often used to precipitate contaminant proteins, rather than the target protein. The precipitation of casein during cheesemaking, or during production of sodium <b>caseinate,</b> is an isoelectric precipitation.|$|E

Plots of the water content ν. the amount of added hydroxide at constant aw revealed a linear relationship between water uptake and cation content, suggesting that the increase in water uptake is mainly determined by the amount and type of cations associated with the caseins. In the aw range tested, Ca 2 + adsorbed about 2 - 7 and Na+ 3 - 18 mol water/mol of cation. This implies that replacement of one mol of casein-bound Na+ by Ca 2 + is accompanied by a displacement of 1 - 11 mol water at aw 0 · 58 - 0 · 95. The loss of water is a consequence of conformational changes induced by the chelating and cross-linking effects of Ca 2 +, which also lead to micelle formatio...|$|R

Sample preparation included a microwave digestion system in closed vessels. The procedure has been validated for skim milk powder employing various reaction mixtures that contain HNO 3, HClO 4, and H 2 O 2. Accurate results were achieved for Na and K with mixtures of HNO 3 and H 2 O 2, but values for Ca and Mg were low. Although the results of these elements were improved when HClO 4 was used instead of HNO 3, greatest accuracy was obtained by measurement, using standard addition, of samples digested with mixtures of HNO 3 and H 2 O 2. The assays exhibited varying degrees of precision when used for <b>caseinates</b> and cheese. The coefficients of variation for replicate analyses of <b>caseinates</b> and cheeses were lowest for Mg (1. 34 to 2. 46 %) and Ca (1. 15 to 2. 69 %) and poorest for Na (3. 35 to 9. 02 %).

40|$|International audienceYogurts are {{important}} dairy products that have known a rapid market {{growth over the}} past few decades. Industrial yogurt manufacture involves different processing steps. Among them, protein fortification of the milk base is elemental. It greatly enhances yogurt nutritional and functional properties and prevents syneresis, an undesirable yogurt textural defect. Protein enrichment can be achieved by either concentration process (evaporation under vacuum and membrane processing: reverse osmosis and/or ultrafiltration) or by addition of dairy ingredients. Traditionally, skim milk powder (SMP) is used to enrich the milk base before fermentation. However, increased quality and availability of other dairy ingredients such as milk protein isolates (MPI), milk protein concentrates (MPC) whey protein isolates (WPI) and concentrates (WPC), micellar casein (MC) and <b>caseinates</b> have promoted their use as alternatives to SMP.

Irradiation of solutions was carried out with Co- 60 gamma rays applying 0 and 32 kGy dose. The increase in viscosity of solutions was found after irradiation connected to induced crosslinking. Lower viscosity values were detected, however, after heating of the solutions irradiated with a 32 kGy dose than after heating of the non-irradiated ones regarding differences in the structure of gels and resulting in different temperature-viscosity curves that were recorded for the irradiated and the non-irradiated samples during heating and cooling. Creation of less stiff but better ordered gels after irradiation arises probably from reorganisation of aperiodic helical phase and β-sheets, in particular from increase of β-strands, detected by FTIR. Films obtained from these gels are characterised by improved barrier properties and mechanical resistance and are more rigid than those prepared from the non-irradiated gels.

40|$|The climates of {{many areas}} in Asia, Central America, the Middle East and Africa make it {{difficult}} to support a dairy industry based on fresh milk. In these areas the shelf life of fresh, undried milk products is short. Concentrated and dry milk products have increased storage stability because of a lower water activity and are therefore desirable in regions with such climatic conditions. Concentrated milk products are obtained from milk by the application of one or a combination of water removal techniques. Drying of these products can reduce the water content to below 3 %. The reduction in water content of milk will increase shelf life and reduce transportation costs. This is particularly important for manufacturers that export products to distant markets.

Fat interacted synergistically with caseins to increase all the hedonic attributes, apart from odor. As far as rheological properties are concerned, elastic modulus (G'), instantaneous elasticity (G g), retarded elasticity (G R) and Newtonian viscosity (? 0) were positively correlated with increasing casein content. However, tan ? was negatively correlated with the aforesaid attributes and increased with increasing fat content.

40|$|Pakistan is {{the third}} largest milk {{producer}} and second largest buffalo milk producer in the world. Buffalo milk is the second produced milk with a contribution of 12. 7 % in the world’s milk production. More than 92 % of this milk is being contributed by India and Pakistan. This milk is richer in protein particularly casein i. e. 34 - 36 g. kg- 1, equivalent to the total protein contents of cow milk. Casein represents 80 % of the total protein of both milks and find as colloidal particles called casein micelles. In buffalo milk, casein micelles are bigger in size, more mineralized and less hydrated but with similar charge as compared to its counter part cow milk (Ahmad et al, 2008 a and b). In spite of the important production of buffalo milk, the technological transformations of this milk into dairy products are very limited as compared to cow milk. Some cheeses or fermented milks like Cheddar, Mozarella, lassi and yoghurts are manufactured from this milk. Protein ingredients manufactured from buffalo milk such as <b>caseinates</b> associated with different minerals and purified whey proteins are absent on the dairy industrial market. One possible way to obtain these types of ingredients from buffalo milk is to use cross-flow microfiltration. This operation is widely used in the dairy industry for the fractionation of casein micelles and whey proteins from cow milk (Maubois, 1991; Saboya and Maubois, 2000; Nelson and Barbano, 2005). This process produces a retentate enriched in casein micelles with a purity expressed as the ratio [casein]/[total protein] higher than 0. 90 (Fauquant et al, 1988; Pierre et al, 1992; Schuck et al, 1994). The technological behaviours of these purified casein micelles during acidification, rennet coagulation and heat treatment are also very similar to milk. For these reasons, these casein micelles purified by cross-flow microfiltration are considered as native. The objectives of this work were to apply cross-flow microfiltration (0. 1 µm) firstly, to have bacteria free buffalo milk without any heat treatment, secondly to isolate and characterize the casein micelles from buffalo milk. For this purpose, cream and bacteria from milks were removed at 50 °C through a cream separator and microfiltration (1. 4 µm), respectively. Casein micelles were then separated and concentrated through cross-flow microfiltration (0. 1 µm) followed by purification through four volume water and again concentrated through water removal. Purification was performed in three main steps: concentration of casein micelles, diafiltration of retentate and final concentration (Fig. 1). The products obtained at different steps of the process were analysed for pH, total solids, proteins fractions, minerals contents and as well for size, zeta potential and hydration of casein micelles. Figure 1 : Technological scheme for the purification of casein micelles from buffalo and cow milk by cross-microfiltrations (pore size of 1. 4 and 0. 1 μm). Microbiological analyses of raw skimmed milk and bacteria free milk after the first microfiltration (1. 4 µm) showed a great reduction of coliforms and FMAR in both milks (Table 1) so the first objective was well achieved. Table 1 : Coliforms and FMAR counts Milk Coliforms FMAR Raw buffalo skimmed milk 3. 3 × 101 7. 5 × 101 Microfiltered buffalo milk < 1 1. 5 × 101 Raw cow skimmed milk 9. 7 × 104 3. 2 × 104 Microfiltered cow milk < 1 6. 5 × 101 As the second objective {{of this study was}} to purify casein micelles from buffalo milk by cross-flow microfiltration, so the results have been described and discussed for each step during the process. The biochemical compositions and physico-chemical characteristics of initial bacteria-free skimmed milks and the different retentates (intermediate, diafiltered and final) have been reported as under. Results obtained with buffalo milk were compared to cow milk and discussed. Bacteria-free skimmed milks: The contents in total protein and casein were higher for buffalo milk than that of cow milk. However, in both milks, casein content as compared to the total protein content corresponded to similar percentage i. e. 80 %. To know more about the differences in the composition between buffalo and cow milk, it was interesting to compare the different ratios. The ratios [total protein]/[total solid], [casein]/[total solid] and [casein]/[whey protein] were 0. 41, 0. 35 and 5. 3 for buffalo milk and 0. 35, 0. 27 and 4. 5 for cow milk, respectively. From these ratios, it is evident that the protein contents of buffalo milk were different than that of cow milk. The total and micellar calcium (Ca) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) concentrations were higher in buffalo milk than in cow milk as also observed by Ahmad et al. (2008 a). The pH values of both milks were close to pH 6. 7. The size of casein micelles from buffalo milk was higher, the zeta potential was similar and the micellar hydration was lower than that of cow milk and as described by Ahmad et al. (2008 a). Intermediate retentates: The contents in total protein and casein were increased for both intermediate retentates in comparison with initial skimmed milks. A slight retention of whey proteins in the intermediate retentate for cow milk compared to buffalo milk was observed. The ratios [total protein]/[total solid] increased up to 0. 54 and 0. 57 for intermediate retentates of buffalo and cow milk, respectively. At the same time, the ratios [casein]/[whey proteins] increased from about 5 for both initial milks to about 10 for both intermediate retentates. These calculated ratios indicated that the purifications of casein micelles were in progress in a similar way for both milks. The total Ca and Pi concentrations increased by 1. 7 and 1. 6 times for intermediate retentates of buffalo milk, and by 2. 3 and 2. 1 times for intermediate retentates of cow milk, respectively in comparison with milks. As discussed with the non protein nitrogen compounds, minerals and ions H+ were also able to pass through the membrane and consequently their concentrations were the same in retentate and permeate. Diafiltered retentates: The contents in non casein nitrogen, non protein nitrogen, whey protein, Ca and Pi were strongly reduced. During the diafiltration, the major part of the soluble compounds present in the aqueous phase of retentates like lactose, minerals, whey proteins and small molecules were removed. The concentration of whey proteins was lower in diafiltered retentate of buffalo milk than that of cow milk. This difference indicated that the whey proteins of buffalo milk were more easily transmitted than cow milk. On the other hand, the contents in total solids of these diafiltered retentates were strongly reduced. During diafiltration, 50. 3 and 54. 5 g. kg- 1 of total solid contents was removed from buffalo and cow milk, respectively. At the end of diafiltration, the total solid corresponded essentially to casein micelles containing minerals. These ratios indicated that diafiltration was particularly efficient to increase the level of purity of casein micelles for both milks. At the same time, the ratios [casein]/[whey proteins] were about 42. 3 and 26. 7 for diafiltered retentates of buffalo and cow milk, respectively suggesting a good and best elimination of the whey proteins in the diafiltered retentates of buffalo milk in comparison with those of cow milk. The pH values of both diafiltered retentates increased in a similar way by about 0. 6 units. The reduction of the ionic strength and especially Pi and citrate from the aqueous phase due to the diafiltration explained theses increases in pH. Indeed, these ions contribute to the buffering capacity of milk and their removals during the diafiltration step led to an increase in pH. The micellar characteristics of both diafiltered retentates were affected in comparison with those determined for milks and intermediate retentates. The zeta potentials of casein micelles from both retentates were more negative after diafiltration. These were related to the increase in pH and to the reduction in the ionic concentration of the aqueous phase induced by diafiltration. Final retentates: The contents in total solid, total protein and casein were increased in comparison with the corresponding intermediate and diafiltered retentates. The ratios [total protein]/[total solid] were 0. 86 and 0. 89 for final retentates of buffalo and cow milk, respectively. For the cow milk, the ratio obtained in this work was in accordance with the published values of 0. 84 (Pouliot et al., 1994), 0. 86 - 0. 88 (Pierre et al., 1992) and 0. 90 (Schuck et al., 1994). The ratios [casein]/[total solid], [casein]/[total protein] and [casein]/[whey protein] were 0. 84, 0. 98 and 45 for final retentate of buffalo milk against 0. 86, 0. 96 and 27 for final retentate of cow milk. The last calculated ratio confirmed the slight retention of whey proteins for cow milk compared to buffalo milk. Two possible reasons can explain this difference of filtration. Firstly, the composition and structures of the whey proteins from buffalo milk are different and consequently their capacities to be microfiltered were also different. The other reason concerns the formation of a fouling layer at the membrane surface during filtration. These different calculated ratios showed that the level of purification of casein micelles of buffalo milk by cross-flow microfiltration was correct and satisfactory. 98 - 99 % of Ca and Pi were associated to casein micelles in both final retentates. Micellar zeta potentials were always more negative as compared to casein micelles of milks because the aqueous phase became very poor in minerals. Conclusions: This study showed that the safe and microbial free buffalo milk can be obtained through cross-flow microfiltration without involving heat and without modifying the nature and nutritional quality of milk. So microfiltration can be considered as a processing technology to have safe, sure buffalo dairy products with their natural quality. It also showed that purification of casein micelles from buffalo milk was possible like cow milk without any major problem. The biochemical analyses of the final retentate of buffalo milk showed that it contained mainly casein and minerals and that the different compounds present in the aqueous phase were well removed. These ingredients can be used in different formulations for Ca and phosphate enrichments...|$|R
