This paper analyzes the reasons for these differences with matching methods. We simulate the impact of changes in certain parameters such as wages, apprenticeship system-related factors and allocation of tasks to apprentices on the cost-benefit ratio using the counterfactual values of the other country. The results show that most of the difference in the net <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> between the two countries can be explained by a higher share of productive tasks allocated to apprentices in Switzerland and the differences in relative wages. apprenticeship training, cost and benefit analysis...|$|R

30|$|The authors’ {{explanation}} of the apparent higher costs in Europe is not clearly developed or explained. Wagonloads and wagon groups are aggregated within individual railway domains (national traffic remains {{a high proportion of}} total traffic activity so control is retained by the train operators/service providers on a basis similar to that as practices in North America). A many-to -many service network was offered by rail operators in the not too distant past but failed to respond and develop to evolving location and service criteria better provided by road freight. Such a network operation would be prohibitively expensive to own, operate and maintain for low and intermittent traffic volumes using existing technology, operational and commercial models and also be unattractive compared with road based alternatives that can and do offer services that rail of itself cannot provide. Inter-modal traffic operation options go some way to offset this using terminal networks for domestic national traffic flows (including deep sea containers and also freight compatible with unitised modules) and also for international traffic within Europe. The assertion that fixed costs account for up to 50  % <b>of</b> the total <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>train</b> operations is not substantiated nor is the contention that <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>train</b> operation are not linked significantly to the degree of capacity (line? wagon assets?). As a result of the Railway Reforms Packages, European train operators have had to acknowledge and absorb the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>train</b> paths and compete for these with other operators and other types <b>of</b> <b>train</b> services and reflect them in their cost structure and pricing.|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{estimate}} the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> building {{a public health}} infrastructure for delivering a population-wide evidence-based multi-level system of parenting interventions to strengthen parenting; reduce risk for child maltreatment and coercive parenting practices; and reduce the prevalence of early child behavioral and emotional problems. Methods Using data from 9 South Carolina counties, this study examines the costs to service agencies <b>of</b> <b>training</b> {{a wide range of}} providers. Using data on the number of children and families served, the paper estimates the total <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> providers sufficient to treat all children and families in a hypothetical community. Results The <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> the universal media and communication component totaled less than $ 1. 00 per child in the population. The <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> service providers to deliver at other intervention levels were quite modest ($ 11. 74 on a per child basis). Conclusions This study shows that a population-wide system of efficacious parenting programs aimed at reducing child behavioral and emotional problems and promoting effective parenting is quite feasible. Rough estimates suggest that these costs could be recovered in a single year by as little as a 10 % reduction in the rate of abuse and neglect. ...|$|R
