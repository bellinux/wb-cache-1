In particular, a commonly adopted assumption in the <b>channel</b> <b>shortening</b> framework is discussed, showing that, when it is violated, the data statistics usually needed for the synthesis of the shortening algorithms {{turn out to be}} periodically time varying (PTV) rather than time-invariant. Elaborating on this point, and considering in particular the recently proposed minimum-mean output-energy (MMOE) blind <b>channel</b> <b>shortening</b> algorithm, it is shown how its synthesis must be modified in order to account for the PTV nature of the data statistics. Numerical results assessing the performance of the proposed blind PTV-MMOE <b>channel</b> <b>shortening</b> algorithm are reported...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Channel {{shortening}} filters {{have been}} used in acous-tics to reduce reverberation, in error control decoding to reduce complexity, and in communication systems to reduce inter-symbol interference. The cascade of a channel and a <b>channel</b> <b>shortening</b> filter would produce an overall impulse response that has more of the energy in the channel impulse response compacted into fewer adjacent samples. Once designed, <b>channel</b> <b>shortening</b> filters operate on a per-sample basis. In this paper, we evaluate sparse FIR filters, which use more design complexity and less per-sample processing complexity, for <b>channel</b> <b>shortening.</b> Our contributions include (1) proposing a new sparse FIR filter design method for <b>channel</b> <b>shortening,</b> and (2) evaluating design tradeoffs in energy compaction vs. implementation complexity for sparse and non-sparse FIR filters. Our simulation results for ADSL channels show that sparse designs could achieve the same energy compaction with half as many coefficients than non-sparse FIR filters for low filter orders.

In this paper, we examine a semi-blind adaptive time-domain equalization (TEQ) strategy in conjunction with Alamouti space-time coding to achieve <b>channel</b> <b>shortening.</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>shortening</b> is necessary when the channel response is longer than the cyclic prefix (CP) in a multi-carrier modulation scheme, which precludes low complexity equalization in the frequency domain.

40|$|The use of <b>channel</b> <b>shortening</b> {{techniques}} for speech dereverberation {{is discussed in}} this paper.

40|$|Abstract—When {{the channel}} delay spread {{is larger than}} the guard {{interval}} of zero-padded (ZP) OFDM transmissions, interblock interference (IBI) might lead to significant performance degradation. Without altering the signal design, a time-domain equalizer (TEQ) can be applied at the receiver to shorten the channel for IBI suppression. In this paper we study several known designs of blind <b>channel</b> <b>shortening</b> in the ZP-OFDM context, exploiting the signal redundancy in the form of guard zeros in the time domain, or null subcarriers in the frequency domain, or both. Numerical results show that blind <b>channel</b> <b>shortening</b> algorithms can catch up or even exceed the performance of a benchmark scheme assuming perfect channel knowledge. Only time-invariant channels are considered in this paper; <b>channel</b> <b>shortening</b> for time-varying channels with large delay spreads such as underwater acoustic channels is an interesting subject that warrants further investigation.

30|$|<b>Channel</b> <b>shortening</b> is an {{equalization}} technique which {{forces the}} effective channel impulse response (combined channel and equalizer) to be confined within a desired temporal window. <b>Channel</b> <b>shortening</b> or time domain equalizers (TEQs) {{have been used}} in communication systems since the early 1970 s [1 – 4].
