50|$|The revolutionary Y-shaped steel chassis had a {{backbone}} {{that divided}} around {{the engine and}} gearbox, and was very light. The suspension was independent all round, making a first for MG and possibly the British motor industry, and used wishbones and longitudinal torsion bars allowing {{a large amount of}} wheel travel to allow for the poor surfaces on many of the contemporary racing circuits, especially Brooklands. Lever arm hydraulic shock absorbers were used. The brakes were cable-operated using 12-inch (305 mm) drums and the wheels were wire spoked and secured by a <b>centre</b> <b>lock</b> nut.|$|E

5000|$|Looking {{for a car}} to {{fill the}} gap between the M-Type Midget and the 18/80, MG turned to another of the engines that had become {{available}} from William Morris's acquisition of Wolseley. This was the 1271 cc 6-cylinder version of the overhead camshaft engine used in the 1929 MG M type Midget and previously seen in the 1930 Wolseley Hornet and had dummy side covers to disguise its origins. Fitted with 1 in twin SU carburettors it produced [...] at 4100 rpm at first, later increased to [...] by revising the valve timing.

50|$|By {{winning the}} 1985 ATCC, JPS Team BMW {{became the first}} team to win the ATCC with a European made car since it became a series instead of a single race in 1969. It was also the first time a European made car had won the ATCC since Bob Jane had won the 1963 Championship driving a Jaguar Mark 2. It was also the first ATCC win for BMW and the first for a 6 cyl car since Peter Brock had used a Holden LJ Torana GTR XU-1 for part of the 1974 series. The team also {{introduced}} <b>centre</b> <b>lock</b> wheels to Australian touring car racing in 1983. Despite the time saved by only having one nut to change per wheel compared to the five it previously had, chief mechanic Pip Barker described pit stops for the cars as a nightmare due to the weight of the air guns used (which could not be picked up by one hand) and the amount of compressed air they required to work.|$|E

All of which was needed to stop the 30 cwt Aston Martin. The alternator was switched to run off the gearbox (which itself had a closer ratio 5th gear) instead of the engine crankshaft. The clutch was now uprated to a triple plate. The suspension was almost standard, with standard rubber bushes but with slight geometry changes. Nylon mountings were also used for a reduced width Dion tube. The roll cage was a NASCAR (instead of FIA) specification cage, which was bolted to the chassis. This alone weighed 50 kg.|$|E

50|$|The rear {{suspension}} was altered early on with geometry changes and {{removal of the}} rear anti-roll bar to reduce a tendency for lift-off oversteer.

At {{the same time the}} suspension was lowered 20 mm with slightly stiffer springs for improved handling.
