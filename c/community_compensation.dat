The forest sector provides insights into the decentralization process writ large, since, as a source of national wealth, "green gold". The study also investigated the effects on local governance of oil compensation, or "black gold" in forested rural areas affected by the Chad-Cameroon pipeline. The study reveals some positive governance outcomes in the management of community forests and parafiscal <b>community</b> <b>compensation.</b> These are less visible in the cases of annual forestry fees and oil compensation. The community forests and parafiscal <b>community</b> <b>compensation</b> are more rooted in local decision-making power to local organizational structures, while annual forestry fees and oil compensation mechanisms are structured more by outside institutions that transfer little or no local decision-decision power to local authorities. Nevertheless, the case studies show that none of the current practices produce more democratic local governance. In most cases, local actors [...] the local communities in this case [...] have not received significant decision-making powers, and they remain subjected to decisions of external administrative bodies, municipal authorities, and timber companies. When communities do have powers and responibilities, they are poorly exercised...|$|E

The implementation of host <b>community</b> <b>compensation</b> measures might help to avoid or reduce local public opposition to CCS.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of seasonal variations in climatological surface chlorophyll points to distinct biogeographical zones in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre. In particular, the Labrador Sea appears well delineated into two regions {{on either side}} of the 60 °N parallel, with very different climatological phytoplankton biomass cycles. Indeed, north of 60 °N, an early and short spring bloom occurs in late April, while south of 60 °N, the bloom gradually develops 1 [*]month later and significant biomass persists all summer long. Nevertheless, at climatological scale, the first-order mechanism that controls the bloom is identical for both bioregions. The light-mixing regime can explain the bloom onset in both bioregions. In the Labrador Sea, the blooms seem to rely on a mean <b>community</b> <b>compensation</b> irradiance threshold value of 2. 5 [*]mol[*]photon[*]m− 2 [*]d− 1 over the mixed layer...|$|E

Using moment conditions of agricultural and forest exploitations, findings indicate deforestation significantly improves welfare both at overall-rural and agricultural household per capita income levels. As a policy implication, {{in the process of}} forest exploitation a balanced approach is needed to take account of the interests of both rural communities, timber companies and international forest-sustainability standards. This should require among other things, {{the development and implementation of}} sustainable forest management plans by timber companies, exclusion from harvesting species that are important to local <b>communities,</b> <b>compensation</b> of timber companies for compliance with management plans as well as involvement of rural communities in monitoring the activities of timber companies. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{forests of}} the Congo Basin are {{exploited}} by rural communities and timber companies at different scales to meet various conflicting interests. The forest contributes in several ways to rural livelihoods, but the growing importance of timber exploitation {{poses a threat to}} this livelihood's fabric and to the conservation of biodiversity. For example 6 % of the top 23 timber species exported from cameroon have important non-timber values to local communities. The paper argues that in the process of forest exploitation, a balanced approach is needed {{to take into account the}} interests of both rural communities and timber companies. This will require among other things the development and implementation of sustainable forest management plans by timber companies, exclusion from harvesting of timber species that are important to local <b>communities,</b> <b>compensation</b> of timber companies for compliance with management plans, and the involvement of rural communities in monitoring the activities of timber companies...|$|R

40|$|Historically, Spain has {{experienced}} relatively little public objection to wind power proposals, {{but this is}} changing {{in the region of}} Galicia, which now hosts a relatively concentrated level of wind turbines. To document and understand this objection, we take a cognitive mapping approach, commenting on its value as a method and focussing particularly on the issue of <b>community</b> <b>compensation.</b> Cognitive mapping structures the causal logic of individuals' thinking, revealing this and facilitating group discussion. Here we compare cognitive maps that reflect different positions on the controversy. Both monetary and in-kind compensation are dismissed by local campaigners and local stakeholder representatives alike. In-kind compensation is regarded as inadequate firstly because it cannot provide the scale of the public goods perceived as necessary by the host community. Secondly, the developer is in any case considered inappropriate as provider of public goods, which the community think should be delivered by local and regional governments...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Job {{satisfaction}} among registered clinical dentists in Australia {{was measured}} to identify issues influencing recruitment and retention. METHODS: A questionnaire {{was mailed to}} {{a random sample of}} 2202 dentists, stratified by state and gender, selected from the 2005 Australian Dental Association directory. RESULTS: A total of 61. 9 % of dentists responded. Analyses showed significant differences in levels of satisfaction for various dimensions of job satisfaction by gender, age group, practice type and geographic area. Differences in satisfaction between male and female dentists related to the relationships with colleagues and administrative responsibilities dimensions. Dentists of different age groups differed on eight dimensions: relationships with colleagues, patients, staff; personal time; intrinsic satisfaction; community; administrative responsibilities and resources. Differences among private and public dentists related to autonomy, relationships with patients, staff, <b>community,</b> <b>compensation</b> and resources dimensions. Dentists working in different geographic areas differed on relationships with staff and community dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: Differences existed between private and public dentists, metropolitan and non-metropolitan dentists, male and female dentists and dentists of different ages. Such differences should be addressed in order to improve recruitment and retention rates of dentists. Workplaces that offer job autonomy, competitive pay, flexible working hours and minimal administrative burden may improve dentist job satisfaction. L Luzzi, AJ Spence...|$|E
40|$|Exotic species invasions and climatic {{variation}} {{that occurred in}} north central Wisconsin provided the opportunity to contrast influences of climate and invasive species in shaping fish community dynamics in five Wisconsin lakes from 1981 to 2001. Year (passage of time) was positively correlated (r. 0. 9) with invasive species. Year, invasive species, and climatic variables were the principal determinants of fish community dynamics according to redundancy analysis (RDA). The same invasive species negatively affected the same general group of species in different lakes; benthic invertivores declined in lakes invaded by crayfish, Orconectes spp., and pelagic zooplanktivores declined in lakes invaded by rainbow smelt, Osmerus mordax. Micropterus dolomieu, Pimephales notatus, and Notropis volucellus increased in abundance in lakes invaded by crayfish. When year was included in RDAs as a covariable (partial RDA), fish community changes in three lakes {{did not differ significantly}} from ordinations of Monte Carlo simulated data; for two lakes, growing season length and lake productivity were significant explanatory variables under the reduced model. The resulting shifts in the fish community might represent declines in those species that used resources similar to the invading crayfish and smelt or were eaten by the invading smelt. Subsequent <b>community</b> <b>compensation</b> might have occurred, with other species increasing in response to the declines in species affected directly by the invasive species...|$|E

40|$|Displacement and {{resettlement}} {{associated with}} the Three Gorges Project in China is at a crucial stage. The previous approach of "near" resettlement, uphill from the dam, has been changed to one of moving large numbers of rural residents out of the reservoir area and settling them in distant agricultural communities. This paper examines the Chongqing reservoir section as a key origin area for the "government-organized distant resettlement" scheme. It examines patterns of distant resettlement to 11 recipient provinces and municipalities in China. Land readjustment in the host <b>communities,</b> <b>compensation</b> and funding for migrants are examined. The Government of China emphasizes "moving out" and "resettling stably" as the key objectives during the physical resettlement or transition period of displacement. However, planning {{for the restoration of}} livelihoods and production of the dislocated rural migrants in the new environments remains inadequate. Whether or not distant resettlement can produce a sustainable reconstruction of livelihoods and production as well as local sustainable development in the destination locations remains to be seen.

40|$|A {{diagnostic}} {{model of}} the mean annual cycles of oxygen, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and nitrate below the mixed layer at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series Study (BATS) site is presented and used to estimate organic matter remineralization in the seasonal thermocline. The model includes lateral and vertical advection as well as vertical diffusion, which {{are found to be}} significant components of the seasonal budgets of oxygen, DIC and nitrate. The vertical and seasonal variation of the remineralization rates deduced from the oxygen and DIC distributions are very similar. Both locate the spring–summer <b>community</b> <b>compensation</b> depth at ? 85 m and the remineralization rate maximum at ? 120 m; nitrate-based estimates of these depths are about 40 m greater. Remineralization rates based on oxygen, DIC and nitrate all show the seasonal maximum to occur in the late spring, presumably reflecting the decomposition of organic matter formed during the spring bloom. The remineralization rate integrated between 100 and 250 m and between mid-April and mid-December is estimated to be 2. 08 ± 0. 38 mol O 2 m? 2, 1. 53 ± 0. 35 mol C m? 2 and 0. 080 ± 0. 046 mol N m? 2. These imply remineralization ratios of O 2 : C= 1. 4 ± 0. 40 and C : N= 19 ± 12. The former agrees well with the canonical Redfield ratio and the latter is significantly larger. The analysis is consistent with the export and remineralization of nitrogen-poor organic matter from surface waters...|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} in situ photosynthesis of benthic microbial mats at various depths in Lake Hoare, a permanently ice-covered lake of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, using oxygen (02) microelectrodes. We further investigated the vertical distribution and activity of pigments in the microbial mats using an imaging pulse-amplitude-modulated fluorometer. Microbial mats {{to at least}} 16. 6 -m water depth are net producers Of 02 during the summer period. Net 02 production ranges from 100 - 500 mu mol m(- 2) h(- 1) at incident downwelling irradiances of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 1. 0 - 4. 6 mu mol quanta m(- 2) s(- 1). Photosynthesis of mat-forming cyanobacteria and diatoms occurs at all lake depths at or close to maximum efficiency. We measured absorption by the pigment arrays at a single water depth and, by assuming that absorption is water-depth invariant, we estimated an area-specific maximum community quantum yield of 0. 073 mol carbon per mol photons. A <b>community</b> <b>compensation</b> irradiance of 0. 1 mu mol quanta m(- 2) s(- 1) was estimated, reflecting extreme shade acclimation. These results confirm estimates previously derived from laboratory gas-exchange measurements and imply that even minor changes in {{the intensity of the}} incident downwelling irradiance of PAR caused by, for example, changes in the transparency of the ice cover or the optical properties of the water column can significantly alter rates of benthic carbon fixation. In situ measurements were confined to mats with flat surfaces. Laboratory measurements at the surface of mats with pinnacled surfaces revealed a complex small-scale chemical structure at the mat-water interface...|$|E
40|$|Oxygen {{exchange}} by effluent {{samples taken}} at weekly intervals from a facultative oxidation pond was investigated over a 7 month period. Concentrations of ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, total and reactive phosphorus, alkalinity, total inorganic carbon, and free CO 2 were measured over 12 months. Gross daily oxygen production within the <b>community</b> <b>compensation</b> depth ranged from 8 gO_ 2 m^- 2 in winter to 43 gO_ 2 m^- 2 in summer. The corresponding range for dark respiration was 5 - 17. 5 gO_ 2 m^- 2 d^- 1. On average, light saturated rates of net oxygen production and {{total net production}} extended to the upper 2 and 15 % of the 1. 3 m mean depth profile respectively. Community respiration to gross production ratios ranged from 1. 58 - 7. 14. Light saturated rates of net oxygen production and dark rates of oxygen consumption increased with seasonal rise in pond temperature as did net production per unit detectable pigment. However, {{the most important factor}} affecting the rate of oxygen production was the concentration of detectable pigment. In laboratory studies, oxygen exchange rates were optimal at pH 5 - 8, but rates declined rapidly as the pH was increased from 8. 0 - 8. 5. Pond pH varied between 6. 7 and 7. 8 throughout the year. Net CO 2 uptake under saturating irradiance (at pH 4. 5) was maximal at 30 microM CO 2 and compensation was reached at about 5 microM CO 2. The minimum concentration of free CO 2 observed in the pond was 190 microM...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} planning issues internationally is the siting of waste disposal infrastructure in local <b>communities.</b> <b>Compensation</b> is viewed as a possible solution to siting difficulties in many countries. However, existing empirical evidence is conflicting {{as to whether or not}} compensation-based siting has reduced opposition to such developments. Thus, before compensation policy can be considered as the solution for recognising social costs and introducing equity into the waste planning system, it is important to understand why people reject waste disposal infrastructure developments and if this rejection continues over the lifetime of facility operations. This paper utilises information gathered through ex-ante – ex-post surveys to fully examine the effects of distance, local authority consultation efforts, experience and other factors, on attitudes towards nonhazardous solid waste landfill developments in potential and actual host communities. Our findings suggest distance proxies expectations of environmental risk in communities with no experience of living with landfill infrastructure. Conversely, distance does not play a significant role in explaining attitudes to landfill development in communities familiar with the development. Familiarity and consultation by authorities are consistently important, even after a landfill has been in operation for a number of years, but in this case these results may capture a feeling of “having served our time” prevalent in these types of communities...|$|R

50|$|During {{the period}} of the Geonim (c. 650-1050 C.E.), {{opinions}} on compensation shifted. It was deemed inappropriate for the leaders of the Jewish community to appear in the marketplace as laborers or vendors of merchandise, and leading a Jewish community was becoming a full-time occupation. Under these conditions, the Geonim collected taxes and donations at home and abroad to fund their schools (yeshivot) and paid salaries to teachers, officials and judges of the Jewish community, whom they appointed.

40|$|<b>Compensation</b> for {{indigenous}} <b>communities</b> {{as a result}} of rural development projects has been a controversial subject. The elements of rights, entitlements, freedoms and justice are often difficult to value. Most of the compensation packages given to the indigenous communities are in market values and non-market values are often ignored. The non-market values which are the social and cultural impacts are very difficult to determine and often not compensated by government. These non-market values are more important compared with market values to the indigenous communities. This paper identifies the reasons why there are conflicts between the policymakers (government) and indigenous communities in terms of valuing compensation by reviewing the empirical literature on economic and social impacts on indigenous communities resulting from relocation.

50|$|In {{explaining}} the antisemitic climate change during the 21st century, the FGA suggested three main developments which influenced the climate for the Austrian Jewish community: Firstly, {{since the beginning}} of public discussion during 2003 concerning restitution and restitution payments to the Jewish Faith <b>Community</b> as <b>compensation</b> for victims of war crimes, a growing extent of antisemitic attitudes towards Jewish citizens and Jewish institutions - in particular the Jewish Faith Community - has been felt. Secondly, the aggravated situation in the Middle East contributed to a negative attitude towards Jewish citizens. The FGA assumes that this is because many still do not make the distinction between the state of Israel and Jews, and hold their Jewish fellow citizens responsible for events in the Middle East. It should be mentioned that according to the annual survey conducted by the ADL in 2007, 'Attitudes Toward Jews and the Middle East in Six European Countries', Austria was the one of the only two countries (together with Hungary) where more respondents cited anti-Jewish sentiment as opposed to anti-Israel feelings as the main cause of the violence directed against Jews in those countries. Thirdly, the FGA argued that a camouflaged, “coded” antisemitism evolved while the taboo against open antisemitism has weakened, but not disappeared. According to the FGA, this led to the growth of the social acceptance of right-wing extremism in Austria.|$|R
