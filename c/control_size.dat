25|$|The {{number of}} {{available}} budding locations {{has a large}} effect on colony fragmentation. A large number of bud nests results in small colony fragments, indicating that the colony {{has the ability to}} <b>control</b> <b>size</b> and caste ratios. However, a minimum group size of 469 individuals appears preferred by the species. Amount of fragmentation does not have an effect on food distribution. After budding, nest units do not compete for resources, but rather act cooperatively. This is evolutionarily explained by the high amount of genetic relatedness among these nest units. In addition, major disturbances to the central nest cause the colony to abandon it and flee to a bud nest. Thus, nest units may exchange individuals after budding occurs, further explaining their cooperative behavior.|$|E

5000|$|Hydrothermal {{synthesis}} of metal oxide hollow spheres {{takes place in}} an autoclave and proceeds through a one-pot synthesis to increase yield while reducing time and resources. To initiate the procedure, carbohydrates and metal salts are dissolved in water at 100-200 °C. [...] Carbon spheres are produced with metal ions integrated into the hydrophobic shell. Calcination allows for removal of the carbon from the product and results in hollow metal oxide spheres. Surface area and thickness of the shell can be manipulated by varying the carbohydrate to metal salt concentration. [...] The completion time for the procedure varies from hours to days. [...] Hydrothermal synthesis is generally simple {{and being able to}} <b>control</b> <b>size</b> and shape is beneficial for specificity. However, the drawback of this approach is a smaller yield compared to other methods. The pH of the reaction medium, temperature, pressure, and cations used in the solution all play a role in determining the nature of the solid.
