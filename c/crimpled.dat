60|$|Opposite him, {{and with}} her back to the door, was a lady of no whit the less {{extraordinary}} character. Although quite as tall as the person just described, she had no right to complain of his unnatural emaciation. She was evidently in the last stage of a dropsy; and her figure resembled nearly that of the huge puncheon of October beer which stood, with the head driven in, close by her side, in a corner of the chamber. Her face was exceedingly round, red, and full; and the same peculiarity, or rather want of peculiarity, attached itself to her countenance, which I before mentioned in the case of the president--that is to say, only one feature of her face was sufficiently distinguished to need a separate characterization: indeed the acute Tarpaulin immediately observed that the same remark might have applied to each individual person of the party; every one of whom seemed to possess a monopoly of some particular portion of physiognomy. With the lady in question this portion proved to be the mouth. Commencing at the right ear, it swept with a terrific chasm to the left--the short pendants which she wore in either auricle continually bobbing into the aperture. She made, however, every exertion to keep her mouth closed and look dignified, in a dress consisting of a newly starched and ironed shroud coming up close under her chin, with a <b>crimpled</b> ruffle of cambric muslin.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} two types of polypropylene fibers on shear strength parameters of sandy soil. To achieve the goals of this research, a sandy soil was obtained from a depth of 40 cm from the natural ground surface around American University of Sharjah. Two types of polypropylene fibers; one highly flexible with flat profile {{and the other with}} relatively high stiffness and <b>crimpled</b> profile were used in this study with four different aspect ratios (L/D) for each type. The initial physical properties of the sand such as specific gravity, angle of internal friction and shear strength were obtained in accordance with American Standard for Testing and Materials (ASTM). The sandy soils were mixed with the two types of fibers at different percentages by dry weight of the sand and four different aspect ratios. The test results of the study showed that the shear strength of the sand increased with increasing the flexible flat profile fibers content. Also it was noticed that by increasing the aspect ratio of the flexible flat profile the angle of internal friction and the shear strength increased. The <b>crimpled</b> profile fiber increased the shear strength of the sand under high normal load and has small or no effect on shear strength of the sand at low aspect ratio under low normal load...|$|E
40|$|Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.) is commercially {{valuable}} {{medicinal plant}} studied for molecular analysis. In the present study, a morphological variant of neem was observed near our department. The leaf pattern was abnormal (<b>crimpled</b> or curly) morphologically observed and was against normal leaves. This curly leaves containing neem tree considered as mutant against normal. It was considered as either environmental/ chemical influence or certain variation {{that might lead}} to mutation in plant genome. To confirm mutation, in this experimentation, this morphological analysis was confirmed by molecular analysis. For that, the genomic DNA was extracted from both the plants and subjected to RAPD analysis. The morphological variants were shown distinct variation in DNA pattern by selected primers. Thus, RAPD profile proves that there was mutation in plant genome. This result supports the initiative to utilize morphological variants in plant breeding applications, and DNA fingerprinting...|$|E

40|$|The huge {{quantity}} concrete {{is consumed}} by the construction industry all over the world, probably second largest after water. In India, the conventional concrete is produced by using natural sand from riverbeds as fine aggregate. Dwindling sand resources poses the environmental problem and hence government restrictions on sand quarrying resulted in scarcity and significant increase in its cost. This paper presents the study of steel fiber reinforced concrete with artificial sand as fine aggregate. Three matrices with compressive strength 20, 30 and 40 MPa were designed and reinforced with <b>crimpled</b> steel fibers at dosage rate of volume fraction 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 percent. The specimens were prepared, cured and tested for compressive strength, flexural strength and split tensile strength. The strength of steel fiber reinforced natural sand concrete (SFRNSC) and steel fiber reinforced artificial sand concrete (SFRASC) have been compared with the test data from the present study. The promotional use of artificial sand will conserve the natural resources for the sustainable development of the concrete in construction industry...|$|E
40|$|Cellular {{junction}} {{formation is}} an elaborate {{process that is}} dependent on the regulated synthesis, assembly and membrane targeting of constituting components. Here, we report on three Drosophila Ly 6 -like proteins essential for septate junction (SJ) formation. SJs provide a paracellular diffusion barrier and appear molecularly and structurally similar to vertebrate paranodal septate junctions. We show that Crooked (Crok), a small GPI-anchored Ly 6 -like protein, is required for septa formation and barrier functions. In embryos that lack Crok, SJ components are produced but fail to accumulate at the plasma membrane. Crok is detected in intracellular puncta and acts tissue-autonomously, which suggests that it resides in intracellular vesicles to assist the cell surface localization of SJ components. In addition, we demonstrate that two related Ly 6 proteins, Coiled (Cold) and <b>Crimpled</b> (Crim), are required for SJ formation and function in a tissue-autonomous manner, and that Cold also localizes to intracellular vesicles. Specifically, Crok and Cold are required for correct membrane trafficking of Neurexin IV, a central SJ component. The non-redundant requirement for Crok, Cold, Crim and Boudin (Bou; another Ly 6 protein that was recently shown to be involved in SJ formation) suggests that members of this conserved family of proteins cooperate in the assembly of SJ components, possibly by promoting core SJ complex formation in intracellular compartments associated with membrane trafficking...|$|E
40|$|Objective Considering past {{studies on}} the {{orthotropic}} anisotropy of arteries in the circumferential and axial directions, this work aims to experimentally study the anisotropic behaviour of arteries by tensioning multi-directional strips of porcine thoracic aorta. Methods Histology is first analyzed by staining arterial sections of three orthotropic (axial, circumferential, and radial) planes. 168 stripped samples from 21 aortas are categorized into three loading-rate groups to investigate the influence of loading rates on the Young’s modulus and ultimate stress. Basing on the Young’s modulus and ultimate stress, the degree of anisotropy is calculated. Moreover, 24 stripped samples from 3 aortas are tested to study the relaxation anisotropy of arteries by fitting the experimental data with a five-parameter Maxwell reduced relaxation function. Results Histological analysis shows the parallel orientation of <b>crimpled</b> collagen and elastin fibres. The Young’s modulus and ultimate stress reach the greatest in the circumferential direction, and the smallest in the axial direction, respectively, and the values in the other directions are in-between; moreover, the two parameters monotonously increase as the samples orientate from the axial to circumferential directions. The Young’s modulus is {{more sensitive to the}} loading rate than the ultimate stress. The degree of anisotropy calculated by the Young's modulus is similar to that by the ultimate stress, and it is independent of loading rates. Stress-relaxation also exhibits anisotropy, whose variation is consistent with those of the two parameters. Conclusions Due to the stress-growth rule, fibre preferably orientates in the circumferential direction, and the preferable orientation results in great mechanical parameters, anisotropy, and small relaxation behaviour of arteries. The work extends the studies on the arterial anisotropy instead of only the circumferential and axial directions, and could be useful to comprehensively understand the anisotropy of arteries...|$|E

40|$|The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) manages {{rights of}} ways that {{transect}} 41 m H (101 m ac) and span over 3000 m (9000 ft) in elevation from seashore to sup alpine. There are approximately 4, 900 native and 1, 000 naturalized alien plant species in California. Only a few hundred are reliably useful in erosion and sediment control. Specifying native and naturalized vegetation mixes for use in hydroseeding or plug planting in conjunction with mechanical erosion control methods can have varying result for minimizing accelerated soil erosion. To investigate these factors, Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, in conjunction with Caltrans and CSU, Sacramento, conducted a study establishing vegetation using hydroseeding and plug planting with erosion control practices of crimped straw, jute netting, gypsum, BFM, and guar tackifier. The vegetative treatments included native vegetation from Caltrans District 5, Bromus carinatus (California brome) seeds and plugs, a typical naturalized erosion control mix from Farm Supply, existing seed bank, mostly Lolium multiflorum (rye grass), and two control boxes left untreated. Percent cover and runoff quality were measured for each box. The goal was to identify initially fast growing vegetation that establishes within 70 days and demonstrates long-term erosion control. Treatments were conducted in 0. 6 by 2 m soil test boxes set at a 2 : 1 (V:H) slope. Seeding rates were typical for District 5 and plugs were planted at 22 and 44 /m 2. Boxes were filled with a sandy clay loam (USDA) soil typical of District 5 fill slopes, compacted to 90 %. The rainfall simulators mimicked a 30 -year storm along the California coast with 1. 5 ” of rain in 1. 5 hours. The highest percentage of vegetation was with the native seedings and plugs, with jute and straw consisting mostly of legumes and forbs. The EC mix and gypsum produced {{the least amount of}} grasses. The EC mix and BFM were very dense stands of legumes. Gypsum and tackifier treatments were relatively bare. Native plants were poorly established in all treatments. The plug plantings were well established. The lowest runoff sediment concentration was with both the native and EC mix seedings and jute, followed by BFM, plugs and jute and finally jute alone. The range was 7. 8 to 1, 0002. 5 mg/L. The highest runoff sediment concentration was the existing vegetation and guar tackifier, <b>crimpled</b> straw, gypsum, and bare soil. The range was 6, 921. 4 to 46, 894. 2 mg/L...|$|E
