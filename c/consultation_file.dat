40|$|Oncogenic osteomalacia is {{an unusual}} and rare clinicopathologic {{syndrome}} characterized by mesenchymal tumors that apparently produce osteomalacia and biochemical abnormalities consisting of hypophosphatemia, normocalcemia, and increased levels of alkaline phosphatase. We collected from the Mayo Clinic files and from our <b>consultation</b> <b>files</b> the records for 17 cases of osteomalacia associated with bone lesions. There were five cases of fibrous dysplasia, three of hemangiopericytoma, and two of phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor. There was one case each of osteosarcoma, chondroblastoma, chondromyxoid fibroma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, giant cell tumor, metaphyseal fibrous defect, and hemangioma. In this study we can figure out that the most common characteristic histologic features of our cases were hemangiopericytomatous vascular proliferation, fine lace-like stromal calcification, and stromal giant cells. In most of the cases, the clinical and biochemical symptoms and signs resolved soon after complete resection of the lesion.

Although the 2008 World Health Organization classification of PTCL-NOS includes 3 variants, low-grade lymphoma is not Included. Of 277 PTCL-NOS cases recorded in our <b>consultation</b> <b>files,</b> we examined the clinicopathologic characteristics of 10 patients with T-cell lymphomas composed of small-sized cells with slight nuclear atypia. Eight patients showed extranodal involvement (5 patients, spleen; 3 patients, thyroid), and 5 patients were at clinical stage I or II. Histologically, all samples presented diffuse infiltrate of small lymphoid cells, with few mitotic figures. Immunohistologically, all samples were positive for CD 3, and CD: 20 Was detected in 5 samples. All samples showed a low Ki- 67 labeling index (mean, 1. 05 %), and 7 samples were positive for central memory T-cell markers. Clonal T-cell receptor gamma chain and/or alpha-beta chain gene rearrangements were detected in all 10 patients.

40|$|In Japan, {{the term}} {{domestic}} violence (DV) refers generally to violence {{between men and}} women in intimate relationships, including spouses and lovers. DV-related <b>consultations</b> <b>filed</b> at spousal violence counseling and support centers have steadily increased in recent years. Support for victims of domestic violence in Japan is provided at women’s consulting offices, women’s protection facilities, maternal and child living support facilities, and shelters operated by NPOs. However, despite progress in developing measures to support DV victims, it is not always clear how the services provided by these institutions relate to social work theory and practices. This manuscript aims to analyze preceding research on this unclear relationship and to discuss the factors responsible. The review first summarizes how support for victims of domestic violence currently operates in Japan. Next, it organizes the findings of previous studies on the unclear relationship of DV victim support with social work theory and practices despite the progressive implementation of various DV-related policies. Finally, the author analyzes three kinds of problems responsible for this state of affairs―legal issues, support worker awareness,and establishment of support methods―and discusses factors contributing to them. Furthermore, the author demonstrates how the lack of clarity surrounding the relationship between DV victim support and social work is the result of interaction between multiple factors, and that society needs to develop and expand DV support policies and practices based on the history of this problem. The paper concludes with a consideration of themes to be taken up by future studies...|$|R

These 3 cases of small cell variant of renal oncocytoma were found among 134 cases of oncocytomas of the kidney in the routine and <b>consultation</b> <b>files</b> of the authors. TAvo of 3 cases were initially {{thought to be}} a malignant tumor by the referring pathologists. In all 3 cases minor areas of the tumors, which were iden-tical to the classical renal oncocytomas were found. The small cell areas were arranged in a characteristic organoid pattern different from all the known types of the renal benign and malignant tumors. We summarize all morphologic, immunohisto-chemical, and ultrastructural features of this unusual oncocytoma variant with re-gard to its differential diagnosis. Int J Surg Pathol 9 (3) : 215 - 222, 2001 Key words: renal oncocytoma, small cell variant, kidney.

The oc-currence is higher in men, with the peak incidence in the seventh decade of life [1 - 3]. In general, RO may show a broad spectrum of appearances, the most common being the alveolar, tubular, or cystic arrangement [4]. The polygonal tumor cells are typ-ically uniform with abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm packed with mitochondria to the virtual exclusion of other organelles.

40|$|Although {{there have}} been a few large case series of giant cell tumor (GCT) in the spine and sacrum, the {{treatment}} of these lesions remains controversial. We are reporting 23 additional cases of giant cell tumor in the spine and sacrum gathered from our institution and the personal <b>consultation</b> <b>files</b> of the senior author. Ten lesions occurred in the sacrum with an average age of 31 years (range of 13 - 49) and 13 occurred in the mobile spine with an average age of 39. 1 years (range of 13 - 64). Most patients presented with pain or neurologic deficit at the site of tumor involvement, and symptoms were usually present for many months prior to diagnosis. Six of the sacral GCT patients were treated with pre-operative arterial embolization and intralesional surgical resection, and two developed a recurrence. Two of the sacral GCT patients had an en bloc resection and neither developed a recurrence. One sacral GCT patient was treated only with serial arterial embolization with good disease control. One sacral GCT patient did not receive any treatment. Eleven spinal GCT patients were treated with en bloc surgical resection and two developed a recurrence, the other two spinal GCT patients were treated with intralesional surgical resection and both developed a recurrence. Giant cell tumors of the spine and sacrum should be managed with en bloc resections whenever possible as this provides the greatest chance for cure. When the risk of post-operative neurologic deficit after en bloc excision is high, as in most of our sacral lesions, conservative therapy involving arterial embolization and intralesional resection offers the best results...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Malignant glioneuronal tumors show {{considerable}} morphological diversity. Their biological {{behavior and}} clinicopathological characteristics are incompletely understood. With {{the exception of}} anaplastic ganglioglioma, they are not assigned to a specific entity in the current WHO classification. It is also not clear whether histological features of these neoplasms influence prognosis. Material and Method: We identified 36 glioneuronal tumors with malignant histological features among the departmental archives and neuropathology <b>consultation</b> <b>files</b> of the authors. We reviewed the pathological and radiological features of these tumors to construct a preliminary histological categorization. Results: Based on their pathological features, we divided the study group into three histologically distinct categories: 1) glioneuronal tumors with a malignant glial component (anaplastic gangliogliomas); 2) glioneuronal tumors with a malignant neuronal/neuroblastic component; 3) glioneuronal tumors with both malignant neuronal and glial components. All tumors occurred in a younger age group compared to glioblastomas and appeared radiologically well-defined, cystic and solid with variable contrast enhancement. There was {{a high rate of}} local recurrence (29 of 36 patients) and 12 patients died during follow-up period. Median progression-free survival was less than 12 months, and did not differ among categories. Cerebrospinal tumor spread was seen in only one patient. Concurrent WHO grade I ganglioglioma and the presence of a malignant neuronal component did not appear to influence prognosisConclusion: MGNTs were considered in three simple categories based on their malignant component(s). Tumors in all categories exhibited a high rate of local recurrence and aggressive behavior akin to malignant gliomas as opposed to classical PNET. Nevertheless, MGNT demonstrated clinicopathological features that distinguish them from typical glioblastoma. The exact nosology of MGNTs is unresolved and our study underscores the need for a more comprehensive classification of these neoplasms within the WHO scheme...|$|R
40|$|Infants {{and young}} {{children}} may be exposed {{to a variety of}} dangerous situations when left sleeping in cots, chairs, or beds. A review of 30 cases of accidental asphyxia occurring in infants {{and young children}} who had been left to sleep unattended was undertaken from the necropsy and <b>consultation</b> <b>files</b> of the Adelaide Children's Hospital. Causes of death included hanging from loose restrainers, clothing, or a curtain cord (12 cases), positional asphyxia/wedging from slipping between a mattress and bed/cot sides or wall, or from moving into a position where the face was covered and the upper airway occluded (16 cases), and suffocation from plastic bed covers (two cases). Cases of co-sleeping in bed with an adult and of non-accidental asphyxia were not included in this review. As the pathological findings were on occasion identical to those that are typically found in sudden infant death syndrome, adequate death scene examination was vital in several cases to allow identification of lethal sleeping environments and to enable steps to be taken to minimise the risk of future deaths due to similar situations. For example, two cases in which infants asphyxiated in rocking cradles led to the investigation of the cradles and to formulation of specific safety recommendations regarding the angle of tilt. Two infants who died after becoming wedged between the back of a couch and a co-sleeping parent in one case and cushions in the other, would indicate that this also represents a potentially lethal sleeping position. Other dangerous situations involved infant car seat restraints, seats with loose harnesses, cots with movable sides or projecting pieces, thin plastic mattress/pillow coverings, and beds with spaces between the mattress and cot side or wall. Lack of supervision at the time of death was a feature of each case...|$|R
40|$|Background: Fine needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) cytology is a popular, {{reliable and}} cost effective technique for {{the diagnosis of}} thyroid lesions. The aim of our study was to review cases of misclassified primary malignant neoplasms of the thyroid by FNA, and assess the causes of cytologic misdiagnosis {{and their impact on}} clinical management. Methods: Clinical data, FNA smears and follow-up surgical specimens of cases diagnosed with primary thyroid carcinoma were reviewed. Results: Of the 365 cases with a malignant diagnosis by FNA over a period of 11 years, nine (2. 4 &#x 0025;) were identified with discrepant histologic diagnosis with regard to the type of primary thyroid malignancy. In addition, four cases were added from the <b>consultation</b> <b>files</b> of the Massachusetts General Hospital. Areas of difficulty contributing to misclassification included overlapping cytologic features (n = 6), rarity of tumors (n = 3), and sampling limitations (n = 4). Of the 13 cases, 12 underwent total or near total thyroidectomy and one patient had concurrent surgical biopsy. Measurement of serum calcitonin levels in one case, with an initial cytologic diagnosis of medullary carcinoma, prevented unnecessary lymph node dissection. Misclassification of medullary carcinoma as papillary carcinoma precluded lymph node dissection in one case. Further management decisions were based on the final histologic diagnosis and did not require additional surgery. Two cases of undifferentiated (anaplastic) thyroid carcinoma were misdiagnosed as papillary thyroid carcinoma. Both patients received total thyroidectomies, which may not otherwise have been performed. Conclusions: A small subset of primary malignant neoplasms of the thyroid may be misclassified with regard to the type of malignancy on FNA. The majority of primary malignant neoplasms diagnosed on FNA require thyroidectomy. However, initial cytologic misclassification of medullary carcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma as other malignant neoplasms or vice versa may have an impact on clinical management...|$|R
40|$|Composite adenoma-carcinoid {{tumors are}} rare {{colorectal}} lesions consisting of intermingled adenomatous and carcinoid components. Unlike other mixed endocrine-glandular colorectal neoplasms, which are generally malignant, their glandular component is histologically benign and their natural history is favorable. We present 4 cases of colonic adenomas containing microcarcinoids, a hitherto undescribed lesion that {{is either a}} precursor of composite adenoma-carcinoids or a related but independent entity. The cases, identified among our surgical and <b>consultation</b> <b>files,</b> were endoscopically routine sessile polyps removed from 4 otherwise normal individuals, 3 from the cecum and 1 from the distal colon. The microcarcinoids were 0. 5 to 1. 5 mm in size and situated within the basal lamina propria, where they interposed between the crypts and muscularis mucosae without disturbing the overall polyp architecture. Histologically, they consisted of collections of low-grade epithelial cells arranged in nests, cords, tubules, and irregular clusters and characterized by eosinophilic, granular, or clear cytoplasm and by round central nuclei with stippled or dusty chromatin. Endocrine differentiation of the microcarcinoids was confirmed by the expression of 3 {{or more of the}} following: Grimelius argyrophil, chromogranin, synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase and somatostatin. No mitotic figures or MIB- 1 or p 53 positivity were observed. The glandular component of the polyps was unremarkable in 3 cases, but 1 polyp, in addition to a microcarcinoid, showed a diffuse pattern of mixed adenomatous-endocrine differentiation. The patients' clinical course was benign on the basis of 2 years' median follow-up (range, 6 mo to 10 y). Two patients with incomplete polypectomies underwent hemicolectomy revealing no residual endocrine neoplasia. Awareness of microcarcinoids in colonic adenomas should help avert potential diagnostic pitfalls posed by their pleomorphism, basal location, and infiltrative patterns, and may help clarify their natural history and possible relationship to composite glandular-carcinoid tumors...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In 1976, Hawk and Hazard {{described}} the tall cell variant (TCV) of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). While the lesions they described had cytologic features of papillary carcinoma, they showed more aggressive behavior {{with a greater}} propensity for extrathyroid extension and lymphovascular invasion than classic PTC. In 1991, Bronner and LiVolsi described a series of patients with TCV that progressed to spindle cell squamous carcinoma (SCSC), a unique form of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. This study describes the variable clinical and pathologic presentations in 31 patients with anaplastic SCSC arising in association with TCV. METHODS: The surgical pathology archives {{as well as the}} personal <b>consultation</b> <b>files</b> of one of the authors (V. A. L.) were reviewed to retrieve cases of SCSC arising in association with TCV. The available clinical as well as pathologic information on all patients was reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients with SCSC arising in association with TCV were retrieved from our files. The average age at primary presentation was 67 (range 32 - 92) with a female-to-male ratio of 2 : 1. Three clinical scenarios for SCSC associated with TCV were identified. These were type I, consisting of TCV with SCSC at the time of presentation (18 patients); type II, consisting of SCSC arising as a recurrence in patients with a known history of TCV (5 patients); and type III, consisting of SCSC presenting as a primary laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma in a patient with or without a known history of TCV (8 patients). The type III cases were of most concern since they often were confused with primary laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and most often were diagnosed after laryngectomy. CONCLUSIONS: SCSC of the thyroid is almost exclusively associated with TCV and can have variable clinical presentations. SCSC is most commonly seen associated with a primary diagnosis of TCV. SCSC may be seen, however, in patients with recurrent PTC and most importantly may present in a fashion similar to primary laryngeal SCSC. Therefore, caution should be exercised in evaluating laryngeal squamous lesions in patients with known history of TCV and without known risks factors for head and neck carcinogenesis...|$|R

Because non-AML/non-LAM PEComas are extremely rare and their natural history and prognostic features undefined, we present our experience with 26 PEComas of soft tissue and the gynecologic tract, the largest series to date. We also performed a detailed review of the literature, with special attention to features predictive of clinical behavior. All PEComas exclusive of AML and LAM were retrieved from our <b>consultation</b> <b>files.</b> Immunohistochemistry for pan-cytokeratin (CK), S- 100 protein, smooth muscle actins (SMA), desmin, vimentin, HMB 45, Melan-A, microphthalmia transcription factor (MiTF), TFE 3, CD 117, and CD 34 was performed. Clinical follow-up information was obtained. Fisher's exact test was performed. The median patient age was 46 years (range, 15 - 97 years); there was a marked female predominance (22 females, 4 males). Sites of involvement included the omentum or mesentery (6 cases), uterus (4 cases), pelvic soft tissues (3 cases), abdominal wall (2 cases), uterine cervix (2 cases), and vagina, retroperitoneum, thigh, falciform ligament, scalp, broad ligament, forearm, shoulder, and neck (1 case each). The tumors ranged from 1. 6 to 29 cm in size (median, 7. 8 cm). Tumors were epithelioid (N = 9), spindled (N = 7), or mixed (N = 10). Multinucleated giant cells were present in 18 cases. High nuclear grade was noted in 10 cases, high cellularity in 7 cases, necrosis in 8 cases, and vascular invasion in 3 cases. Mitotic activity was 0 to 50 mitotic figures (MF) / 50 high power fields (HPF) (median, 0 MF/ 50 HPF) with atypical MF in 6 cases. IHC results were: SMA (20 / 25), desmin (8 / 22), HMB 45 (22 / 24), Melan-A (13 / 18), MITF (9 / 18), S- 100 protein (8 / 24), CK (3 / 23), vimentin (12 / 14), TFE 3 (5 / 17), c-kit (1 / 20), and CD 34 (0 / 7). Clinical follow-up (24 of 26 patients, 92 %; median, 30 months; range, 10 - 84 months) showed 3 local recurrences and 5 distant metastases. At last available clinical follow-up, 2 patients (8 %) were dead of disease, 4 patients (17 %) were alive with metastatic or unresectable local disease, and 18 patients (75 %) were alive with no evidence of disease. No patient in our series had a history of tuberous sclerosis complex. Recurrence and/or metastasis was strongly associated tumor size > median size (8 cm), mitotic activity greater than 1 / 50 HPF, and necrosis. We conclude that PEComas of soft tissue and gynecologic origin may be classified as "benign," "of uncertain malignant potential," or "malignant. " Small PEComas without any worrisome histologic features are most likely benign. PEComas with nuclear pleomorphism alone ("symplastic") and large PEComas without other worrisome features have uncertain malignant potential.

Of 113 assessments (7 not rated due to missing data) reviewed, specialists agreed with pharmacist's diagnosis in 33. 6 % of cases, disagreed in 38. 9 % but were unable to determine the diagnosis in 27 % of cases. Treatment was deemed appropriate in 42 % of cases, inappropriate in 27 % and indeterminate in 31 % of cases. Twenty-three patients (58 %) returned a questionnaire and 12 of these (54. 5 %, 1 missing) stated that their condition had cleared completely following pharmacist advised treatment. Almost all (91. 3 %) were very satisfied or satisfied with the advice and/or treatment provided. CONCLUSION: Specialists judged the clinical appropriateness of pharmacist diagnosis and management as suboptimal yet patients were more positive. This study indicates a possible need for greater assessment-related training in dermatology for study pharmacists and further work to determine the generalisability of findings.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the adherence of women victims of sexual violence, to AIDS chemoprevention treatment. A quantitative study was carried out at a care service to victims of sexual violence in Salvador (Bahia, Brazil). Study participants were 172 women. Data were collected through interviews with forms and <b>consultation</b> of patient <b>files.</b> The results showed that 45. 4 % of the abused women were teenagers and 40. 7 % of the attended women were raped. Only 54 % {{of the women were}} advised to use antiretrovirals to prevent HIV. Adherence to treatment occurred in 57. 4 % of cases and discontinuity corresponded to 42. 6 %. Non-adherence to treatment was attributed to psychological or emotional disorders and non-understanding of the established treatment. Therefore, it is important that professionals pay careful attention in order to perceive the conditions that might increase women’s vulnerability to the infection.

40|$|Abstract__ __Introduction:__ In {{order to}} face the {{challenges}} associated with an aging population, traditional health care models are increasingly being replaced with integrated care models [1]. However, while evidence exists that these models benefit older people, {{there is a lack}} of knowledge about how integrated care affects the informal caregiver [2]. In this study, effects of a new integrated model on the caregivers of frail elderly have been investigated. The model is characterized by an umbrella organizational structure involving case management, multidisciplinary teams, protocols, <b>consultations,</b> and patient <b>files.</b> The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of this model on caregivers in terms of perceived health, quality of life, objective and subjective burden. __Theory and Methods:__ A quasi-experimental design with before/after study and control group was used. Data was gathered using questionnaires (instruments: 2 items of the RAND- 36 [3], short form objective burden informal care [4], SRB [5], CarerQoL [6],Cantril’s Ladder [7]). Analysis encompassed group comparison using paired and unpaired tests and regression analyses with baseline measurements, control variables (sex, age, relation to care-receiver, living together with care-receiver, income, education, having a life partner, employment, durance of care giving) and the intervention as independent variables. Additionally, analyses of subgroups and interaction effects will be performed. __Preliminary results:__ Within and between group differences were found and indicated significant reductions in health (P< 0. 1) and life ratings (P< 0. 1) and more financial problems (P< 0. 05) for the control group. Regression analysis revealed that caregivers in the intervention group were more likely to take on HDL type tasks (P< 0. 05) and experienced less financial problems (P< 0. 05). __Conclusion:__ The integrated care intervention increased the likelihood of caregivers performing HDL tasks and reduced their financial problems...|$|R
40|$|Esta dissertação analisa os sentidos da procura pelo reconhecimento e exercício da paternidade para agentes jurídico-administrativos, homens (possíveis pais) e mulheres (mães) no contexto do “Projeto de Reconhecimento de Paternidade-DNA” desenvolvido pelo Ministério Público do Estado do Espírito Santo. Parte da compreensão das condições sócio-históricas que permitiram a emergência da “ausência de pai” como um “problema social” no cenário brasileiro para analisar como os sentidos da procura pelo reconhecimento da paternidade de crianças, assim como os sentidos de paternidade e maternidade, são construídos nas interações de cada momento do fluxo dessa política pública jurídica. A partir de trabalho de campo etnográfico, realização de entrevistas com agentes administrativos e público, e {{consulta}} a arquivos do Projeto, pude observar a interveniência de padrões de moralidades que são acionados pelos agentes administrativos com o fim de mediar o processo de investigação e reconhecimento de paternidade, com o intuito institucional de promover o direito de crianças e adolescentes ao reconhecimento paterno e à crescerem em ambiente familiar, segundo o que preconiza o Estatuto da Criança e do Adolescente (ECA). Para isso, os agentes elaboram os sensos de responsabilidade de ser pai e de ser mãe, que apontam tanto para as condutas de pai para com o filho e de mãe para com o filho, quanto para as relações de pai e mãe entre si, para uma gestão compartilhada do filho. This dissertation {{analyzes the}} meanings {{of the search for}} recognition of paternity and for taking on paternity constructed by Brazilian law professionals, by men who are the possible fathers and by women who are the mothers. The context of this research was the “Recognition of Paternity-DNA Project” developed by the D. A. Office (“Ministério Público”) of the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. At the introduction we analyze the socio-historical conditions that made possible the conceptualization of the “absence of the father” as a “social problem” in the Brazilian context. This analysis is used to understand {{the meanings of}} the search for recognition of paternity as well as the meanings of paternity and maternity constructed on the interactions between participants of each procedure of that legal public policy. Through ethnographic field work, interviews with participants and <b>consultation</b> of the <b>files</b> of the “Project” we observed the intervention of patterns of moralities adopted by the professionals while they mediate the process of recognition of paternity with the institutional goal of promoting the rights of children and adolescents to that recognition and to living in a family, according to Brazilian legislation (“Estatuto da Criança e do Adolescente” - ECA). The professionals construct the meanings of responsibility of being a father and responsibility of being a mother which relate to the behaviors fathers and mothers must have towards their sons {{as well as to the}} relations fathers and mothers must have with each other in order to share the child raising duties...|$|R
