40|$|Repeated {{subcutaneous}} {{injections of}} ganglionic blocking agents in cats {{were found to}} cause a supersensitivity towards adrenaline in the submaxillary gland and the nictitating membrane. The supersensitivity resembled that produced by preganglionic denervation, namely section of the chorda tympani {{in the case of}} the gland and of the cervical sympathetic trunk {{in the case of the}} membrane. The blocking compounds used were <b>chlorisondamine</b> <b>chloride</b> and hexamethonium. With the former, the sensitization could be obtained in the normally innervated structures. When hexamethonium was used, however, the effect on the gland could be produced only if the synapse had been made particularly susceptible to the blocking action of this agent; this was achieved by cross-suture experiments...|$|E
40|$|Barron. Total {{autonomic}} blockade {{eliminates the}} attenuated pressor response to angiotensin II in pregnant rats. Am. J. Physiol. 265 (Regulatory Integrative Cornp. Physiol. 34) : R 1270 -R 1275, 1993. -Pressor responses to angiotensin II (ANG II) are markedly attenuated in reflex-intact pregnant animals, a phe-nomenon widely attributed to intrinsic changes in vascular re-activity. To test {{the hypothesis that}} gestational augmentation of neural reflex activity contributes importantly to this phe-nomenon, changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were com-pared during constant infusion (25 - 400 ng l kg-l l min-I) of ANG II in conscious virgin and pregnant rats, using a model of total autonomic blockade (<b>chlorisondamine</b> <b>chloride</b> and meth-scopolamine bromide), with restoration of baseline hemody-namics by infusion of norepinephrine. Basal CO was higher an...|$|E
40|$|AMIR, S. Central glucagon-induced {{hyperglycemia}} {{is mediated}} by combined {{activation of the}} adrenal medulla and sympathetic nerve endings. PHYSIOL BEHAV 37 (4) 563 - 566, 1986. [...] Intracerebroventricular (ICV) microinjection of glucagon (0. 0025 - 2. 5 /~g) produced significant dose-dependent hyperglycemia in mice. This hyperglycemic effect was prevented by pretreatment with the sympathetic ganglionic blocker <b>chlorisondamine</b> <b>chloride</b> or bilateral adrenalectomy plus chemical sympathectomy with 6 -hydroxydopamine. Similar pretreatments {{had no effect on}} the plasma glucose responses to systemic glucagon administration. Pretreatment with somatostatin, which blocks pancreatic glucagon secretion had no effect on the hyperglycemic response to central glucagon administration. The results suggest that the increase in plasma glucose following central glucagon administration is mediated by combined action of adrenal and sympathetic amines to stimulate hepatic glucose production, or additionally to inhibit insulin release from the pancreas. The possible involvement of glucagon in the central nervous system in systemic glucoregulation is discussed. Glucagon CNS Hyperglycemia Sympathetic nervous system Mice GLUCAGON, a 29 amino acid peptide product of the alpha cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, exerts a controlling influence on the maintenance of glucose homeostasis, acting to stimulate glucose production in the liver wheneve...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} {{were obtained}} from cells in vitro in the inferior mesenteric ganglia of the cat. Neurones could be classified into three types: non-spontaneous, irregular discharging and regular discharging neurones. Non-spontaneous neurones had a stable resting membrane potential and responded with action potentials to indirect preganglionic nerve stimulation and to intracellular injection of depolarizing current. Irregular discharging neurones were characterized by a discharge of excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e. p. s. p. s.) which sometimes gave rise to action potentials. This activity was abolished by hexamethonium bromide, <b>chlorisondamine</b> and d-tubocurarine <b>chloride.</b> Tetrodotoxin and a low Ca 2 + -high Mg 2 + solution also blocked on-going activity in irregular discharging neurones. Regular discharging neurones were characterized by a rhythmic discharge of action potentials. Each action potential was preceded by a gradual depolarization of the intracellularly recorded membrane potential. Intracellular injection of hyperpolarizing current abolished the regular discharge of action potential. No synaptic potentials were observed during hyperpolarization of the membrane potential. Nicotinic, muscarinic and adrenergic receptor blocking drugs did not modify the discharge of action potentials in regular discharging neurones. A low Ca 2 + -high Mg 2 + solution also {{had no effect on}} the regular discharge of action potentials. Interpolation of an action potential between spontaneous action potentials in regular discharging neurones reset the rhythm of discharge. It is suggested that regular discharging neurones were endogenously active and that these neurones provided synaptic input to irregular discharging neurones...|$|R
40|$|Treatment with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) {{significantly}} improved survival following induction of fatal systemic anaphyl-axis in mice. The protective effect was mediated centrally since survival was increased by intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) administra-tion of TRH at doses {{which had no}} effect when given systemically (5 - 25 ktg). Acid-TRH, a deomidated metabolite ofTRH which lacks hypophysiotropic influences, was as effective as TRH when administered i. c. v., but it was inactive following intravenous (i. v.) admin-istration. The protective effect of TRH in anaphylaxis was reversed by treatments which diminished sympathetic outflow to the adren-al medulla, i. e. ganglionic blockade by <b>chlorisondamine</b> <b>chloride</b> or surgical denervation fthe adrenal glands. Destruction of sympa-thetic nerve endings by the catecholamine urotoxin 6 -hydroxydopamine did not alter the response to TRH. Finally, selective block-ade of fl-adrenoceptive sites by propranolol diminished the effect of TRH. Blockade of a-adrenoceptors by phentolamine ordopa-minergic receptors by domperidone did not alter the protective effect of TRH in anaphylaxis. Collectively, {{these results indicate that}} the beneficial effect of TRH in anaphylactic shock involves central nervous ystem actions which are mediated peripherally through in-teraction of sympatho-adrenomedullary catecholamines with fl-adrenoceptive effectors. The possibility that TRH exerts its protective actions in shock by acting centrally to functionally antagonize the pathophysiologic effects of endogenous opiate peptides (endor-phins) will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|The changes {{produced}} by reserpine and the ganglionic blocking agent, <b>chlorisondamine</b> <b>chloride</b> {{on the blood}} pressure, peripheral flow and blood vessel caliber of the hamster have been studied {{in an attempt to}} determine the first cause of the hypotensive effect of these compounds. CIRCULATORY responses to ganglionicblocking agents are reported to vary with the level of arterial pressure, 1 state of anes-thesia, 2 " 4 rate of administration, 6 dose, 6 route and frequency of administration 7 and according to the etiology of the hypertension. 8 Vascular responses to reserpine have been reported to vary with the level of blood pressure 9 ' 10 and state of anesthesia. 11 ' 12 Nevertheless, in the responsive hypertensive human and in the normotensive anesthetized laboratory animal, these agents interfere with some cardiovascular activity which is required for sustaining blood pressure, thus producing a decline in blood pressure and, further, they act to prevent compensation by the several mechanisms which are normally brought into play to restore a reduced arterial pressure. The specific cardio-vascular mechanism by which these two drugs initiate blood pressure decline have not been unequivocally elucidated. We therefore decided to study directly the effects of these two agents on peripheral circu-lation in the hope that observed effects on flow, vessel size and blood pressure might help to determine the first cause of the vascular actions of these compounds. METHODS Male golden hamsters weighing 80 to 100 Gm. were used in this study. The method of Lutz and co-workers 13 was employed except that the pouch was not cut to facilitate observation of the vessels and was kept moist with physiologic saline. Photo-micrographs were taken at. 1 sec exposure time. ...|$|E
