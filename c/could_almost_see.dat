60|$|Miss Cornelia {{looked so}} grimly {{determined}} that Anne <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> {{her with a}} spade in her hand.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Philippa {{looked so}} determinedly grim that I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> {{her with a}} spade in her hand. I laughed aloud at the picture summoned up.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know as to that, sir," [...] {{said the}} captain, moving on, [...] "but there they are, {{and some of}} 'em {{polished}} to that extent you <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> your face in 'em." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, why had {{the fellow}} said that? Curious how this desperate secret feeling {{of his own}} made him see {{sinister}} meaning in this servant, in Oliver's visit of last night--in everything. It was vile--this suspiciousness! He <b>could</b> feel, <b>almost</b> <b>see,</b> himself deteriorating already, with this furtive feeling in his soul. It would soon be written on his face! But what {{was the use of}} troubling? What would come, would--one way or the other.|$|R
60|$|Jude soon {{joined them}} at his rooms, {{and shortly after}} they {{prepared}} for the ceremony. Phillotson's hair was brushed to a painful extent, and his shirt collar appeared stiffer {{than it had been}} for the previous twenty years. Beyond this he looked dignified and thoughtful, and altogether a man of whom it was not unsafe to predict that he would make a kind and considerate husband. That he adored Sue was obvious; and she <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> be <b>seen</b> to feel that she was undeserving his adoration.|$|R
60|$|It {{was when}} the pinch came, the {{subscriptions}} fell off, and the weekly payments by the union dwindled to a few shillings {{for the support of}} a whole family, that the rough virtues {{of the people of the}} mining districts came strongly into prominence. Starvation was doing its work, and told first upon the women and children. Little faces, awhile since so rosy and bright, grew thin and pinched, chubby arms shrank until the bone <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> be <b>seen</b> through the skin, and low fever, a sure accompaniment of want, made its appearance.|$|R
60|$|Her {{body was}} so thin that one <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> her skeleton. Her chest was {{as flat as}} a boy's. Her mouth, with its narrow pale lips, was ugly, and her skin was faintly green.|$|E
60|$|She showed {{wonderful}} courage. I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> the cry {{for help}} rising to her lips. She repressed it; she had still presence of mind enough to foresee what might happen before she could rouse the sleeping men.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a hill," [...] Rachel replied. There {{could be}} no doubt that Mrs. Flushing had {{represented}} the vigorous and abrupt fling of the earth up into the air; you <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> the clods flying as it whirled.|$|E
6000|$|Angel Clare, to whom {{three-quarters of}} this {{performance}} was a commonplace act of kindness, now approached Izz. She quietly and dreamily lowered herself into his arms, and Angel methodically marched off with her. When he was heard returning {{for the third}} time Retty's throbbing heart <b>could</b> be <b>almost</b> <b>seen</b> to shake her. He went up to the red-haired girl, and while he was seizing her he glanced at Tess. His lips could not have pronounced more plainly, [...] "It will soon be you and I." [...] Her comprehension appeared in her face; she could not help it. There was an understanding between them.|$|R
60|$|There {{could be}} no doubt as to the latter point, for the deck had been blown up, {{probably}} by gunpowder, near the main-hatch, leaving a great hole, through which the hold <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>almost</b> {{as far as the}} bulkhead of the forecastle.|$|R
2500|$|The book {{is divided}} into three parts and <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> be <b>seen</b> as a trilogy of novellas. The first part details Templar {{investigating}} Trelawney and discovering the cause of her criminal actions, ultimately resulting in him allowing Trelawney to kill one of the men responsible for framing her father, which has the effect of dissolving the Angels of Doom. During this part we learn that the Saint lives in Upper Berkeley Mews, Mayfair, [...] "where the Saint had converted a couple of garages, with the rooms above, into the most ingeniously comfortable fortress in London" [...] and that he has a manservant there called Orace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Willie jibed {{with his}} name considerable. He weighed {{about as much as}} a hundred pounds of veal in his summer suitings, and he had a 'Where-is-Mary?' {{expression}} on his features so plain that you <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> the wool growing on him.|$|E
60|$|Barney <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> {{the smile}} of {{satisfaction}} upon the thin lips of Peter of Blentz as this broad hint fell from the lips of the Austrian diplomat--a hint that seemed to the American little short of the death sentence of Leopold, King of Lutha.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can depend}} upon you for that, Mr. Pathurst?" [...] His whole voice and manner had changed. It was {{practically}} a command, and I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> fangs, bared and menacing, sprouting in {{the jaws of}} that thing I fancied dwelt behind his eyes.|$|E
60|$|So intense was the {{attention}} of all in the Swash, that a wink of Harry's <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> have been <b>seen,</b> had he betrayed even that slight sign of human infirmity at the flash and the report. The ball was flattened against a stone of the building, within a foot of the mate's body; {{but he did not}} stir. All depended now on his perfect immovability, as he well knew; and he so far commanded himself, as to remain rigid as if of stone himself.|$|R
60|$|For {{he was on}} {{the edge}} of a vast hole in the bottom of the sea, up which was rushing and roaring clear steam enough to work all the engines in the world at once; so clear, indeed, that it was quite light at moments; and Tom <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>almost</b> up to the top of the water above, and down below into the pit for nobody knows how far.|$|R
50|$|The railcars were {{intended}} for branch line services and <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>almost</b> {{all over the}} GDR, except on lines with steep gradients. Due to their top speed of 90 km/h they were also be used in stopping train services on mainlines, in particular north of Berlin. Furthermore, the saw regular use on suburban services around Berlin and Leipzig, and on staff trains.|$|R
60|$|To {{precisely}} describe Captain De Stancy's admiration was impossible. A sun {{seemed to}} rise in his face. By watching him they <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> the aspect of her within the wall, so accurately were her changing phases reflected in him. He seemed to forget {{that he was not}} alone.|$|E
60|$|In fact, if {{you were}} to mount to the roof of the Mausoleum Club itself on Plutoria Avenue you <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> the slums from there. But why should you? And on the other hand, if you never went up on the roof, but only dined inside among the palm trees, you would never know that the slums existed which is much better.|$|E
60|$|But {{these were}} all gone, and I pacified Helen by assuring her that I would tell her such long stories about these things that she <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> them in her mind's eye. But I think, {{by the way she}} smiled, that she had only a second-rate degree of belief in my power of description. She was a smart little thing, and she {{believed}} that Corny was the queen of girls.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of the}} {{long-range}} radar station at Poling caused few problems. The Chain Home Low radar there was working and <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>almost</b> as far out to sea. Along the surrounding coastline, for 70 miles, another six radar stations gave interlocking stations which provided cover, {{so there was no}} hole in the system. Within a few days, mobile units were moved into wooded areas nearby to provide cover until Poling was repaired.|$|R
50|$|At the {{epicenter}} of the 1935 Timiskaming earthquake, cracks in gravel and sand <b>could</b> be <b>seen.</b> <b>Almost</b> all chimneys were damaged or destroyed, and some cracks developed in brick walls. These conditions persisted 110 km away from {{the epicenter}}. The next day, Tee Lake (close to the epicenter) was clouded. It is suspected that sediment which was previously undisturbed was shaken up by the earthquake. This event scored a 7 on the Modified Mercalli Scale.|$|R
60|$|So, {{when no one}} was looking, Tommy Trout {{slipped out}} of the safe little pool where all the other little Trouts were playing. He swam just a little speck of a ways farther still. Now he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>almost</b> around the Big Rock. Then he swam just a little speck of a ways farther and--oh dear, dear! he looked right into the mouth of a great big, big fish called Mr. Pickerel, who is very fond of little Trouts and would like to eat one for breakfast every day.|$|R
60|$|And then Milly loomed {{up with a}} {{thousand}} dishes on her bare arm--loomed up big and white and pink and awful as Mount Saint Elias--with a smile like day breaking in a gulch. And the Klondiker threw down his pelts and nuggets as dross, and let his jaw fall half-way, and stared at her. You <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> the diamond tiaras on Milly's brow and the hand-embroidered silk Paris gowns that he meant to buy for her.|$|E
60|$|IN {{the center}} of the valley was a great cluster of palaces that {{appeared}} to be built of crystal and silver and mother-of-pearl, and golden filigree-work. So dainty and beautiful were these fairy dwellings that Twinkle had no doubt for an instant but that she gazed upon fairyland. She <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see,</b> from the far mountain upon which she stood, the airy, gauze-winged forms of the fairies themselves, floating gently amidst their pretty palaces and moving gracefully along the jeweled streets.|$|E
60|$|But {{his first}} remarks were quite {{sensible}} in meaning and tone. Apparently {{he had no}} recollection of the night scene. And if he had he didn't betray himself once. Neither did he talk very much. He sat on the skylight looking desperately ill at first, but that strong breeze, before which the last remnant of my crew had wilted down, seemed to blow a fresh stock of vigour into his frame with every gust. One <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> the process.|$|E
6000|$|One <b>could</b> guess at, <b>almost</b> <b>see,</b> his {{profound}} {{distaste for}} the journey, his distress at {{a difference of}} feeling with his wife. With his serious view of the sublunary comedy Fyne suffered from {{not being able to}} agree solemnly with her sentiment as he was accustomed to do, in recognition of having had his way in one supreme instance; when he made her elope with him--the most momentous step imaginable in a young lady's life. He had been really trying to acknowledge it by taking the Tightness of her feeling for granted on every other occasion. It had become a sort of habit at last. And it is never pleasant to break a habit. The man was deeply troubled. I said: [...] "Really! To go to London!" ...|$|R
60|$|Ormsgill went, and {{crossing}} the hot space {{of dust and}} sand walked into the hut. Dazzled as he was by the change from the glare outside, he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>almost</b> nothing {{for a moment or}} two. The place was also filled with an acrid haze, but by degrees he became accustomed to the dimness and made out Gavin lying against the wall. He looked up with a little wry smile, but Ormsgill moving nearer saw that his face was gray and drawn. There was dust on his thin duck clothing, and in two spots a small dark-colored stain.|$|R
6000|$|... 'As the hush {{of evening}} crept {{over the world}} and we {{proceeded}} over the hill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to return to the house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to make her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her Fear. You know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk? Even the breeze stops in the trees. To me there is always an air of expectation about that evening stillness. The sky was clear, remote, and empty save for a few horizontal bars far down in the sunset. Well, that night the expectation took the colour of my fears. In that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally sharpened. I fancied I could even feel the hollowness of the ground beneath my feet: <b>could,</b> indeed, <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> through it the Morlocks on their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark. In my excitement I fancied that they would receive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of war. And why had they taken my Time Machine? ...|$|R
60|$|But on the {{occasion}} in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast and now at the binnacle, you <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> that thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement.|$|E
6000|$|Katharine {{immediately}} dropped {{all that}} she was holding; her strained expression relaxed, and exclaiming, [...] "Of course! Why didn't I think of that!" [...] she seized the telephone receiver and gave her number. Mary looked at her steadily, and then left the room. At length Katharine heard, through all the superimposed weight of London, the mysterious sound of feet in her own house mounting to the little room, where she <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> the pictures and the books; she listened with extreme intentness to the preparatory vibrations, and then established her identity.|$|E
60|$|Blacky's {{heart beat}} fast with {{excitement}} {{as he drew}} near that old tumble-down nest. Would those two big white eggs be there? Perhaps there would be three! The very thought made him flap his wings a little faster. A few more wing strokes {{and he would be}} right over the tree. How he did hope to see those eggs! He <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> into the nest now. One stroke! Two strokes! Three strokes! Blacky bit his tongue to keep from giving a sharp caw of disappointment and surprise.|$|E
40|$|My {{principal}} {{research question}} is: How can the directed devising techniques {{and principles of}} practice found in contemporary dance and theatre be adapted to the composition of music? The relationship between fixed material and improvisation within devised projects is often a grey area (see Etchells: 2013 b). Some performances are tightly scored with little room for the performers to steer the performances - whereas other performances <b>could</b> be <b>almost</b> <b>seen</b> as free improvisation. The difference between improvisation and devising is always found in the performer’s relationship to the material. Devising processes can generate material whose definition is so elusive that its realisations vary wildly from night to night. But however inexpressible, devising material always has a definite meaning for the performers to which they return in every performance - seeking to generate new interactions and new connections. In every performance we search to find the ephemeral moments that might become a lasting memory. During my research, I have become increasingly interested in developing a performance practice that uses performer freedom to discover and stimulate unique experiences within performances. Although I feel I have made progress in moving towards this, I {{know that there is}} much more to explore in this practice.

50|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1941, he was moved to Oflag VI-B in Dössel outside Warburg. The camp was on a plain which rose {{slightly}} {{to the south and}} was above the town of Warburg or the village of Dössel, so that except for a hill to the south they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>almost</b> 360 degrees. Five hundred yards up the hill there was a barn which was important to the escapers. Officers with special interests had a chance to meet others with similar interests who had been in different camps and that went for birdwatchers particularly. Amongst these were John Barrett, John Buxton and George Waterston. They met once a month in John Buxton's room to record the birds they had seen and had regular talks and discussions.|$|R
40|$|Throughout 1999 and 2000, the Internet and {{e-commerce}} rapidly {{became a}} priority {{concern for the}} business media, together with other associated constituencies such as employment agencies, management consultants, business schools, venture capitalists, and the world?s major stock exchanges. Under the umbrella term of ?New Economy? we witnessed the semiotic production of a distributed, heterogeneous, linked, socio-technical assemblage that conceived of the (economic) world in a very specific way. What was perhaps especially contemporary and unique about this phenomenon was its short life span, {{the extent to which}} mainstream institutions were so rapidly and willingly implicated, and the paucity of real economic or material referents in which to ground and locate the ?e-revolution?. As one commentator suggested, the idea of the New Economy was in large part not about economies or technologies at all, but about ways of thinking about economies (Frank, 2001). We choose to read New Economy narratives as myths. These myths were of a near future, a future that <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> be <b>seen</b> and grasped. In this paper we document and describe these New Economy myths through a broad semiotic analysis of advertisements published in the Financial Times (UK edition) over the period March 2000 to December 2000. All the advertisements are made available via hyperlinks (at www. ephemeraweb. org/journal), thus allowing the reader to engage with this text in creative ways; which may involve ignoring our analysis...|$|R
