50|$|The term <b>cognitive</b> <b>science</b> {{was coined}} by Christopher Longuet-Higgins in his 1973 {{commentary}} on the Lighthill report, which concerned the then-current state of Artificial Intelligence research. In the same decade, the journal <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Science</b> and the <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Science</b> Society were founded. The founding meeting of the <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Science</b> Society {{was held at the}} University of California, San Diego in 1979, which resulted in <b>cognitive</b> <b>science</b> becoming an internationally visible enterprise. In 1972, Hampshire College started the first undergraduate education program in <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Science,</b> led by Neil Stillings. In 1982, with assistance from Professor Stillings, Vassar College became the first institution in the world to grant an undergraduate degree in <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Science.</b> In 1986, the first <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Science</b> Department in the world was founded at the University of California, San Diego.|$|R

40|$|<b>Cognitive</b> <b>science</b> {{arose in}} the 1950 s when it became {{apparent}} that a number of disciplines, including psychology, computer science, linguistics, and philosophy, were fragmenting.

25|$|Meanwhile, {{breakthroughs}} in molecular, cell, evolutionary, and developmental biology generated {{a cornucopia of}} data-based theory relevant to cognition. Categorical assignments were problematic. For example, the decision to append cognitive to a body of biological research on neurons, e.g. the cognitive biology of neuroscience, is separate from the decision to put such body of research in a category named <b>cognitive</b> <b>sciences.</b> No less difficult a decision needs be made—between the computational and constructivist approach to cognition, and the concomitant issue of simulated v. embodied cognitive models—before appending biology to a body of cognitive research, e.g. the cognitive science of artificial life.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s {{and into}} the 2000s, Carnegie Mellon {{solidified}} its status among American universities, consistently ranking in the top 25 in the national U.S. News & World Report rankings, and in the top 60 (ranking 55th in 2013) amongst universities worldwide. Carnegie Mellon is distinct in its interdisciplinary approach to research and education. Through the establishment of programs and centers that are outside the limitations of departments or colleges, the university has established leadership in fields such as computational finance, information systems, <b>cognitive</b> <b>sciences,</b> management, arts management, product design, behavioral economics, energy science and economics, human-computer interaction, entertainment technology, and decision science. Within the past two decades, the university has built a new university center (Cohon University Center), theater and drama building (Purnell Center), business school building (Posner Hall), student union and several dormitories. Baker Hall was renovated in the early 2000s (decade), and new chemistry labs were established in Doherty Hall soon after. Several computer science buildings, such as Newell Simon Hall, also were established, renovated or renamed in the early 2000s (decade). The university has most recently completed building the Gates Hillman Complex and continues renovating historic academic and residence halls.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{was once}} thought by {{scientists}} that any indeterminism in quantum mechanics occurred at too small a scale to influence biological or neurological systems, there is indication that nervous systems are influenced by quantum indeterminism due to chaos theory. It is unclear what implications this has for the problem of free will given various possible reactions to {{the problem in the}} first place. Many biologists don't grant determinism: Christof Koch argues against it, and in favour of libertarian free will, by making arguments based on generative processes (emergence). Other proponents of emergentist or generative philosophy, <b>cognitive</b> <b>sciences</b> and evolutionary psychology, argue that a certain form of determinism (not necessarily causal) is true. They suggest instead that an illusion of free will is experienced due to the generation of infinite behaviour from the interaction of finite-deterministic set of s and parameters. Thus the unpredictability of the emerging behaviour from deterministic processes leads to a perception of free will, even though free will as an ontological entity does not exist. Certain experiments looking at the neuroscience of free will can be said to support this possibility.|$|E

40|$|The <b>cognitive</b> <b>science</b> of {{religion}} is a relatively recent attempt to explain religious beliefs using the methods of <b>cognitive</b> <b>science.</b> There has been interest amongst an ever increasing number of scientists, philosophers and theologians as to the impact this research might have on the justification of the religious beliefs themselves. I will examine the impact the <b>cognitive</b> <b>science</b> {{of religion}} has upon Alvin Plantinga’s reformed epistemology, which claims that belief in God can be warranted {{even if it is}} not based on evidence. Throughout the course of discussion, I shall consider if the <b>cognitive</b> <b>science</b> of religion poses epistemological and ontological problems for Plantinga’s model of theistic belief.

I will attempt to show that mental variation already plays an important (though not always explicit) role in <b>cognitive</b> <b>science.</b> Additionally, I will suggest that explicating the role of mental variations in cognition may be seen as a vital component of maintaining the strength of certain approaches and "schools" of <b>cognitive</b> <b>science...</b>|$|R
