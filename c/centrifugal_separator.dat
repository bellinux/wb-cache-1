Initially only the long-wheelbase One Ten was available and it was sold with the same engine line-up as the preceding Series III model- 2.25-litre petrol and diesel engines and the 3.5-litre Rover V8. However, Land Rover planned a series of rolling improvements. Launched shortly before the short-wheelbase Ninety model in 1984 was a 2.5-litre diesel engine. This {{was little more than}} an updated version of the existing diesel unit (at this time 22 years old). The stroke was lengthened to improve torque, and an updated cylinder head was used to reduce noise and emissions. A more modern injector pump improved fuel economy and an improved glow plug system improved cold-starting performance. The most significant change was the swapping of the chain-driven camshaft for one driven by a fibre toothed belt, which also drove the repositioned injector pump. The drive vacated by the injector pump was used to power a vacuum pump for the brake servo system. To reduce engine weight, extensive use of aluminium castings was made for the cambelt case, vacuum pump, rocker cover and other parts. Other small improvements were made such as the fitment of a spin-on cartridge oil filter instead of older, harder-to-change element type and the fitting of under-piston oil jets. In the mid-1980s Land Rover was part of the Land Rover Group, responsible for production of the Freight Rover van. The 2.5-litre diesel was fitted to the Freight Rover 300-series and the FX4 taxi (the engines for these applications had slight design changes, such as higher-mounted injector pumps and non-waterproof cambelt cases. They received the designations 14J and 15J respectively. Being fitted with a timing belt rather than a chain the 15J engine suffered none of the reliability problems in the FX4 that its 10J predecessor had encountered (see above)). The engine became a special-order only option after the introduction of turbodiesel engines (see below) but remained in production (and popular with military and some commercial buyers) until 1994. The British Army used this engine {{in the vast majority of}} the 20,000 Land Rovers it bought between 1985 and 1994. A manufacturing flaw with pistons combined with Army maintenance practises (such as a tendency to over-fill the sump with oil) caused the engines to over-breathe and ingest their oil, leading to piston failure. Late military-spec engines had a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>separator</b> in the breather system, allowing excess oil to drain back to the sump. These engines were designated 13J. and 11J (ref Land Rover Defender Military 110 1991 Supplementary Parts Catalogue). These later, modified engines were the first in their class (small capacity high-speed diesels) to pass the Ministry of Defence's arduous 500-hour durability trial.|$|E

50|$|Sharples Separator Works, {{also known}} as the Gumas Warehouse and Kauffman Warehouse, is a {{historic}} factory complex located in West Chester, Chester County, Pennsylvania. The complex was built between 1890 and 1909, and includes 14 contributing buildings. They range between one and three stories, are of brick construction, and have low pitched gable roofs or hipped roofs. It was home to the manufacturing works for the Sharples Tubular <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>Separator,</b> the first American invented cream separator.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the advent}} of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>separators,</b> {{separation}} was performed by letting milk sit in a container until the cream floated {{to the top and}} could be skimmed off by hand. A variant container-separator had a nozzle at the bottom which was opened to allow the milk to drain off. A window in the side, near the nozzle at the bottom, allowed the operator to observe when the milk was drained.|$|R
50|$|The <b>centrifugal</b> <b>separator</b> {{was first}} {{manufactured}} by Gustaf de Laval, {{making it possible}} to separate cream from milk faster and more easily, without having to let the milk sit for a time, and risk it turning sour. Possibly because Gustaf de Laval manufactured the first cream separators, many people credit the invention to de Laval. However, many patents appear before his, all of them labelled as 'improvements'. One of the first specifically for cream separation was patented by W. C. L. Lefeldt and C. G. O. Lentsch.|$|E
5000|$|In 1882 he {{introduced}} {{his concept of}} an impulse steam turbine and in 1887 built a small steam turbine to demonstrate that such devices could be constructed on that scale. In 1890 Laval developed a nozzle to increase the steam jet to supersonic speed, working off the kinetic energy of the steam, rather than its pressure. The nozzle, now known as a de Laval nozzle, is used in modern rocket engine nozzles. De Laval turbines can run at up to 30,000 rpm. The turbine wheel was mounted on a long flexible shaft, its two bearings spaced far apart on either side. The higher speed of the turbine demanded that he also design new approaches to reduction gearing, which are still in use today. Since the materials {{available at the time}} were not strong enough for the immense centrifugal forces, the output from the turbine was limited, and large scale electric steam generators were dominated by designs using the alternative compound steam turbine approach of Charles Parsons. [...] Using high pressure steam in a turbine that had oil-fed bearings meant that some of the steam contaminated the lube-oil, and as a result, perfecting commercial steam-turbines required that he also develop an effective oil/water separator. After trying several methods, he concluded that a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>separator</b> was the most affordable and effective method. He developed several types, and their success established the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>separator</b> as a useful device in a variety of applications.|$|E
50|$|The Clayton steam {{generator}} {{is similar to}} the Stone-Vapor, but the burner and flow directions are reversed. The heating coil is mounted within a simple cylindrical casing. Rather than helical, cylindrical layers, the Clayton coils are arranged as layers of flat spirals. Water is pumped into the top layers and forced downwards. Again, the tube diameter increases in steps, as evaporation takes place. The final turns form a single closely spaced helical cylinder around the burner as a water-wall furnace and is heated by radiant heat. The steam output is passed through a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>separator</b> and a dry steam quality of 99.5% is claimed.|$|E

40|$|The {{criticality}} of rotor and stator {{contact in}} a large-size marine separator is studied by numerical modelling. Two plausible mechanisms leading to such contact, namely rolling {{of a ship}} in steady-state motion and a suddenly occurring unbalance in the rotor, are considered. It is found that contact due to sea motion may be tolerable, while sudden development of unbalance at operating speed can lead to unacceptably high contact forces. This agrees with experience of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>separators</b> operating on board of ships...|$|R
5000|$|In 1889 Robert {{acquired}} the UK rights to manufacture and sell Danish engineer Mikael Pedersen's new cream separator, which through a spinning <b>centrifugal</b> <b>separator</b> allowed {{the machine to}} run at a constant speed and hence create a regular consistency of cream. Marketed in the UK and British Empire as [...] "The Alexandra Cream Separator", its success resulted in Pedersen moving to Dursley. In 1899, he founded the Dursley Pedersen Cycle Company with Ashton Lister. Robert was a pioneer of business in Western Canada, and took the first cream separator in that region over the plains of Alberta in a journey made by horse buggy.|$|E

The fabric was wrapped around hoops of 109 cm diameter, the top hoop was connected to the ceiling. One of the suggestions was for the nozzle of the suction head to be more flexible, increasing its utitlity. The hose for the spray head connected {{at the top of the}} shower. The shower could be collapsed down to the ground when not in use.|$|E
50|$|Gustaf de Laval's {{construction}} made {{it possible}} to start the largest separator factory in the world, Alfa Laval AB. The milk separator represented a significant industrial breakthrough in Sweden. Within {{the first decade of the}} 1900s, there were over twenty separator manufacturers in Stockholm. Separators in modified form are also used on ships to purify oil, which may have been their original use, because in its original form de Laval proposed the separator for use in his steam turbine. De Laval's turbine used mechanically lubricated journal bearings which weren't insulated from the inside of the turbine. When the steam condensed into water it contaminated the oil. To purify the oil a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>separator</b> was used, which was later adapted to the dairy industry.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} wet milling takes the corn grain and steeps it in a dilute {{combination}} of sulfuric acid and water for 24 to 48 hours {{in order to}} separate the grain into many components.

The remaining components of fiber, gluten and starch are segregated out using screen, hydroclonic and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>separators.</b>|$|R

50|$|If a {{gas stream}} {{carrying}} liquid mist flows {{in a circular}} motion at sufficiently high velocity, centrifugal force throws the liquid mist outward against {{the walls of the}} container. Here the liquid coalesces into progressively larger droplets and finally gravitates to the liquid section below. Centrifugal force {{is one of the most}} effective methods of separating liquid mist from gas. However, according to Keplinger (1931), some separator designers have pointed out a disadvantage in that a liquid with a free surface rotating as a whole will have its surface curved around its lowest point lying on the axis of rotation. This created false level may cause difficulty in regulating the fluid level control on the separator. This is largely overcome by placing vertical quieting baffles which should extend from the bottom of the separator to above the outlet. Efficiency of this type of mist extractor increases as the velocity of the gas stream increases. Thus for a given rate of throughput, a smaller <b>centrifugal</b> <b>separator</b> will suffice.|$|E
5000|$|The seven {{courtyard}} bas reliefs {{were designed}} in an Iowa City workshop, and the terra cotta panels were created using a kiln designed by Paul E.

[...] The central panel depicts three Jersey cows and a bull located above the basin of a semicircular double-tiered fountain that flows into a reflecting pool. The panels on the left depict the early American era of hand milking, transporting the raw milk by wagon to the market, separating milk, and butter churning.
