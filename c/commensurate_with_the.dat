40|$|Abstract – We {{present an}} {{incentive}} scheme to stimulate {{investment in the}} improvement/expansion of the transmis-sion network in the competitive market environment. The formulation of these incentives {{is based on a}} decentralized transmission asset investment model and is derived from the value added to the social welfare by an asset invest-ment. In the formulation, we view each potential investor as a player in a cooperative game and we use the unique solution provided by the Shapley value to allocate the payment to each successful investor <b>commensurated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> increase in social welfare the investment brings to the system. The formulation brings valuable insights on the transmission investment topic.

40|$|The {{channels}} of the cobalt formate frameworks consist of one-dimensional channels {{that have a}} zig-zag configuration. Propane (C 3) has a length that <b>commensurates</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> channel segment length; longer n-alkanes such as n-butane (nC 4), n-pentane (nC 5) and n-hexane (nC 6) have conformations that straddle two channel segments. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations show that the adsorption strength of C 3 is {{higher than that of}} n-butane (nC 4) and n-pentane (nC 5); this unusual hierarchy is a direct consequence of the commensurate-incommensurate adsorption. CBMC simulations also reveal the possibility of separating C 3 -nC 6, C 3 -nC 4, nC 4 -nC 6 and nC 4 -nC 5 liquid mixtures for which the adsorbed phase contains predominantly the shorter alkane. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the hierarchy of self-diffusivities is non-monotonic and is the mirror image of the hierarchy of adsorption strengths...|$|R

What sorts of intellectual options and strategies were available to people during a given period? What types of lexicons and terminology were known and employed during certain epochs? Stressing the importance of not attributing traditional thought to earlier investigators, Kuhn's book argues that the evolution of scientific theory does not emerge from the straightforward accumulation of facts, but rather from a set of changing intellectual circumstances and possibilities.

The Lunar Series consisted of six glyphs, referred to by letters, E, D, C, X, B, and A and represented the attempts to create the cyclical calendrical structure capable of predicting the synodic period of the Moon. In this paper, I am providing a method of detecting possible intercalations needed to fit the lunar motion and a possibility of the use of a 4784 -day period, derived from the Xultun Lunar Table, as a lunar correction cycle.
