Since 1964, the Plans allowed the positive economic and social transformations, {{and contributed to the}} increased rationality of the economic policy. At the same time the plans were not capable of restraining the inflationary tensions, neither correcting serious regional imbalances, leading to the disordered urban growth and worsening the environment.

40|$|U prvom dijelu članka autor daje pregled socijalne politike evropskih socijalističkih zemalja prije sloma socijalizma 1989 / 90. godine. Tada je socijalna politika bila u službi autoritativne ideologije i državnog paternalizma. U drugom dijelu analiziraju se socijalni problemi i mjere socijalne politike u razdoblju tzv. postsocijalizma, koji su nastali u procesu prelaska u pluralističko društvo i tržišnu ekonomiju. Na kraju priloga daju se procjene o modelima socijalne politike koji će u narednom razdoblju prevladati u pojedinim od tih zemalja. The fall {{of socialist}} regimes in Eastern Europe {{took place in}} the course of the year 1989 and later, and the metaphor of these events was {{dismantling}} of the Berlin Wall. Since then, the Eastern European countries have been undergoing the period of transition from socialist to capitalist societies. Numerous social problems have arisen during the transition so far and they have been subject to analysis both in the East and in the West. In the paper, the author first points out the social policy features of the former socialist period. The social policy then was part of the ideological system and was characterized by a pronounced egalitarianism. All the people had the right to work but <b>concealed</b> <b>unemployment</b> was very much spread. Wages used to be relatively low, so that people turned to the so called “grey economy”. Also, there existed the privileges of the ruling elite. The health protection services were free but of a low quality. In principle, everybody was entitled to a flat but it was very difficulty to get one. The social security system was under the state control and there was no clear connection between the contributions and taxes on the one hand, and social levies on the other. The family and children were protected by the state. Many women were employed but the housework burden was still on them. In general, the state had the role of a mighty distributor of the social status, work and material assets. Major problems in the transition period have resulted from the fact that the old security structure has to be abandoned and at the same time the new one has not been established: the market, a civil society and democratic institutions. The result is a general aggravation of the living conditions. There is a serious unemployment, a decrease of the living standards, social insecurity, and at the same time the market elements are being introduced in health and housing and they endanger the poor citizens’ strata. The social policy of the transition period reflects itself in two types of measures. The goal of the firs group of measures is to diminish social problems, whereas the second group ought to establish new social security schemes that would correspond to the new market conditions. The experience so far has shown that various social policy models have been developing in Eastern Europe and that they are the result of the development level, tradition and current situation in each post- socialist country...|$|E

50|$|Rachel Watson is a 32-year-old {{alcoholic}} {{reeling from}} the dissolution of her marriage to Tom, who left her for another woman, Anna Watson. Rachel's drinking has caused her to lose her job; she frequently binges and has blackouts. While drunk, she often harasses Tom by phone and sometimes even in person, though she {{has little or no}} memory of these acts once she sobers up. Tom is now married to Anna and has a daughter with her, Evie - a situation that fuels Rachel's self-destructive tendencies, as it was her inability to conceive a child that began her spiral into alcoholism. <b>Concealing</b> her <b>unemployment</b> from her flatmate, Rachel follows her old routine of taking the train to London every day; her train slowly passes her old house, which is now occupied by Tom, Anna, and Evie. She also begins watching from the train an attractive couple who live a few houses away from Tom, fantasising about their perfect life together. Rachel has never met them and has no idea that their life is far from perfect, or that the woman, Megan Hipwell, helps Anna care for her child.|$|R
40|$|On 29 December, 1996 the {{conflict}} in Guatemala between the URNG, a leftist guerrilla organization, and the authoritarian state came to an end. With {{the implementation of the}} peace agreements and the completion of peace-building, Guatemala has without doubt taken an important step on the road to democracy. However, the country’s regime does not guarantee a civilized life for its citizens. Even by Latin American standards, it permits an extremely high level of violence. This can be characterized as violence in peace. Although the rates of homicide conditioned by this violence are higher than those that prevailed during the civil war, there is no danger of a return to war. During the war political violence was the main cause of death, and violent crime has now taken its place. This report analyses three forms of postwar violence which are especially typical of Guatemala: political violence, the maras, and lynch law. It then goes on to examine their causes. In the course of this examination, a number of elements which are generally supposed to be causes of violence are excluded as causal factors: the perpetuation of a culture of violence or/and war-violence racism and ethnic exclusion, poverty, and inequality {{in the sense of a}} general distribution of income as measured by the Gini coefficient. In the next step, an alternative model of explanation is presented. This distinguishes between enabling structures which make violence possible and structures that might prevent it (with particular reference to the absence of preventive structures). The report identifies regime hybridity and a rent economy as structures that make violence possible, and investigates these structures in order to identify the concrete configurations which are immanent to the structures and cause violence. In the case of the rent economy, the specific structures identified are the especially pronounced bipolarity between the oligarchy and the lowest quintile of the population, new rents as outlets for oligarchical structures and catalysts of violence, low rates of investment, and a low level of empowerment of work. However, none of these structures is, on its own, a cause of the high intensity of violence; they form a complex system. The absence in Guatemala of a structure that could prevent violence can be identified in the poor performance of the security sector, i. e. the police and judiciary, and in the lack of democratic commitment on the part of civil society in this sector. This low level of performance is, in addition to political exclusion and the absence of the rule of law, a characteristic feature of regime hybridity. Although this report is a case study, it has an intrinsically comparative character. This is because the other Central American countries (El Salvador and Honduras with a higher, and Costa Rica and Nicaragua with a lower intensity of violence) form the matrix which renders visible the specificity of Guatemala. Nicaragua is of particular significance for this implicit comparison, because it is the only country in Central America that has experienced a civil war in the recent past but seen a low level of violence since the end of that war. The conclusion of the report identifies two ways in which violence, or the intensity of violence, can be limited in the long term. In the Costa Rican model, a low intensity of violence has been achieved directly, via a long historical path in which “Democracy = Performance + Democratic Content” is combined with “Social Market = Empowerment II of Labour + Production of Investment Goods”. In the Nicaraguan model, a low intensity of violence has been achieved indirectly but over a shorter period of time; here, there can be no doubt about the absence of democracy, and therefore the existence of regime hybridity, or the absence of a social market economy, and therefore the existence of a rent economy. The main finding of the report follows from the Nicaraguan model: the level of violence can be reduced even though ethnically based exclusion, poverty, and inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient) are present, and even though a rent economy and regime hybridity are present as well. If violence is to be successfully reduced, it is necessary for the police and judiciary to be supported conceptually and practically in their efforts to prevent violence and to rehabilitate violent offenders, and to bring about improvements in criminal investigation practices, the support provided to victims, and consistent criminal justice policies. Development aid can help in all these areas. Simultaneously, measures must be taken to bring about the empowerment of civil society – which, however, should not mean the empowerment of vigilantism. In addition, the situation of the lowest quintile of the population should be improved in such a way that there is at least a prospect of relative socioeconomic egalitarianism. This can be done if smaller enterprises are strengthened so that they can serve as a counterweight to the ruling oligarchy, in the context of an improvement in the rate of investment in the production of investment goods. In this way it would be possible to reduce both the official level of unemployment and the <b>concealed</b> <b>unemployment</b> that exists in the informal sector, leading to the empowerment of work. These autochthonous policies are necessary for Guatemala, and they should be combined with the exertion of international political pressure on the USA’s problematic policies on immigration, integration, and deportation. This should include the provision of support to Guatemala (as well as El Salvador and Honduras) for the integration of young people deported from the USA. This report presents the first systematic analysis of postwar violence in Guatemala. It is based on approximately 50 interviews with Guatemalan academics, politicians, police and judicial officers, Maya priests, and NGO activists, and also with violent offenders, all of whom were interviewed during a month-long period of field research in Guatemala in March 2006...|$|E
