40|$|ABSTRACT. Pyrazoloazines are {{extremely}} useful in agriculture and medicine. The main {{objective of this}} article is to synthesize some new pyrazoloazines. Ethyl 3 -amino- 1 H-pyrazole- 4 -carboxylate undergoes diazotization, couples with activated methylene compounds and cyclizes to form pyrazolo[5, 1 -c][1, 2, 4]tri-azine derivatives. The title compound also reacts with α-substituted cinnamonitriles to produce pyra-zolo[1, 5 -a]pyrimidine derivatives. Structures of newly synthesized compounds are established via chemical and spectral methods. Some pyrazoloazines are found to be useful in agri-cultural applications as herbicides and plant growth regulants 1, and in medicinal applications as antibiotics 2, antilipemics and <b>cardiotonics</b> 3, central nervous system agents 4, anxiolytics 5, treatment of influenza 6, antide-pressants and antihypertensives 7, and its antileishma-nial and antitrypanosomal activities 8.

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{prognostic}} value and correlations of hemodynamic parameters during operations under extracorporeal circulation (EC), {{as well as the}} possibilities of mathematically predicting the time that takes to recover the normal function of the heart operated on. Subjects and methods: Ninety-three patients (88 males and 5 females) who had undergone myocardial revascularization under EC were examined. The standard intraoperative monitoring involved pulmonary arterial catheterization and transesophageal echocardiography (TEEcho-CG) The duration of postopertative inotropic therapy was recorded. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to comparatively assess the prognostic value of hemodynamic parameters. Results: At the end of surgery, left ventricular ejection fraction, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, and cardiac index were established to be significant predictors of the duration of using <b>cardiotonics.</b> The analysis permitted the prognostic value of the established hemodynamic predictors to be depicted as a linear regression equation.

The study revealed the significant intraoperative hemodynamic predictors of recovery of the function of the myocardium after its revascularization under EC. The proposed procedure for interpreting the data obtained, by using a Swan-Ganz catheter and TEEcho-CG, predicts the duration of required sympathomimetic therapy and hence the time of recovery of normal function of the heart operated on.  </p...|$|R

They show promising performances, as compared with other classical geometrical descriptors (as molecular volume, etc.), both in that regards the overall performances, measured by the C. V. Explained variance and in the interpretability of the regression equation. However they have not all the requirements of a good structure representation. Moreover some selectable parameters seem to have a great importance, so that the refinement of the regression model requires time and the evaluation step must be performed in condition of full-validation, because predictive optimisation is used in the selection of parameters, and the final model must be checked on molecules never used to refine the model or, in this case, the parameters of the structure representation...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Peripartum {{cardiomyopathy}} usually presents with systolic {{heart failure}} {{during the last}} months of pregnancy and up to five months postpartum. The disease is rare and can be fatal. Case Outline. We report a 30 -year-old female who was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, with maturation and cytogenetic finding of t(8; 21) (q 22;q 22),del(9) (q 22) in January 2004. She was treated with chemotherapy and achieved complete remission that lasts to date. She became pregnant and delivered a healthy newborn with caesarean section in 2009. Seven months later, she again became pregnant and delivered the second child with caesarean section in January 2011. Seven days after delivery she developed symptoms and signs of heart failure. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, low voltage and negative T-waves in inferior and lateral leads. Echocardiography revealed global left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 15 %, with mobile thrombotic mass of 12 mm attached to the left ventricle wall. She was treated with both unfractionated and low-molecular heparin, diuretics, <b>cardiotonics,</b> and beta-blockers. Within six following weeks left ventricle systolic function improved up to 25 - 30 %. The full clinical recovery was achieved in September 2013, resulting in absence of heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction of 54 %. Conclusion. Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rare condition. The cause of cardiomyopathy is unknown, but it is believed that it could be triggered by various conditions and risk factors. Although the patient was treated with cardiotoxic drugs (doxorubicin and mitoxantrone) in permitted doses, they could have been contributory factors of myocardial damage. Close monitoring of cardiac function in the peripartal period might be beneficial in patients treated with cardiotoxic drugs. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. 175080 I br.
