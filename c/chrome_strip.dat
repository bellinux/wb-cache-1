2500|$|In 1954 the Imperial Custom {{had a new}} grille {{consisting}} of a heavy wraparound horizontal center bar with five ridges on top and integrated circular signal lights. Its front fender nameplate was above a <b>chrome</b> <b>strip,</b> which {{ran the length of}} the front door {{to the front of the}} door opening. The rear fender stone guard was larger than in 1953, but the rocker panel molding and rear fender <b>chrome</b> <b>strip</b> style were still the same. The back-up lights were now located directly below the taillights, rather than dividing the lights as in the previous year's model. The Imperial Crown shared basic styling with the Imperial Custom. However it had center-opening rear doors and Cadillac-like rear fender taillights. Air conditioning was standard on the Imperial Crown [...]|$|E
2500|$|The ALSID-1 Deluxe {{featured}} a different grille {{compared to the}} standard model. The large center bar was absent and instead a pair of fog lights are mounted just inside of the front turn signals. Between the fog lights [...] "PRINCE" [...] is spelled out in individual gold letters. A painted side strip, surrounded by a <b>chrome</b> <b>strip</b> ran horizontally {{the length of the}} car, widening from front to back. On this side strip was the side badge, which said [...] "Skyline Deluxe".|$|E
2500|$|The 1953–1954 Chevrolet range had {{a unique}} and {{somewhat}} awkward look about it and much of this stemmed from {{its role as a}} transitional model to introduce a raft of changes that were necessary {{to pave the way for}} the introduction of the 1955–1957 range that really established the Bel Air as a cultural icon. The pre-war technology, such as torque tube drive, six-cylinder splash feed engines, knee action suspension, split windshields, etc., of the early models was phased out and the foundations for the first post war modern Chevrolet passenger car were finalized in this 1953–1954 model. The Bel Air series featured a wide <b>chrome</b> <b>strip</b> of molding from the rear fender bulge to the rear bumper. The inside of this stripe was painted a coordinating color with the outside body color, and [...] "Bel Air" [...] scripts were added inside the strip. Lesser models had no model designation anywhere on the car, only having a Chevy crest on the hood and trunk. 1953 was the first year for a curved, one-piece windshield.|$|E

5000|$|... 1957: 1488 cc, [...] New grill insert again, flatter roof, <b>chrome</b> <b>strips</b> along belt line. The {{cabriolet}} was {{no longer}} part of the line. Prices in Germany: DM 5,510 to 6,560. 169,721 units made.|$|R
2500|$|American Motors {{advertising}} {{assured that}} the new Matador {{was not just a}} name change and facelift, but in reality it was the 1970 Rebel restyled with a longer front clip and a new interior. The 1971 model year Matadors acquired a [...] "beefier" [...] front end look for all three body designs: two-door hardtop, four-door sedan, and station wagon. The AMC Matador shared its basic body design from the firewall back with the Ambassador, which was built on the same platform, but had a longer wheelbase and front-end sheetmetal, a formal grille and luxurious trim, as well as more standard equipment that included air conditioning. Interior wise, it shared the same dash, instrument cluster, steering wheel, and arm rests as the 1970 Rebel. Also reused was the 1967–1970 Rebel [...] "Weather Eye" [...] three-lever fan/heat control unit. The 1971 model came with a split-bench front seat with individual fold-down center arm rests for passenger and driver seats. Externally the 1971 model retained the same trunk lid <b>chrome</b> <b>strip</b> and rear-corner chrome garnishes as the 1970 Rebel. The rear bumper was also the same as the 1970 Rebel but with a new tail light lens assembly of three-in-line square lenses with rounded corners.|$|E
2500|$|Pontiac {{produced}} cars offering [...] (3.25x3.75 in, 82.5x95mm) L-head straight 6-cylinder {{engines in}} the Pontiac Chief of 1927; its stroke was the shortest of any American {{car in the}} industry at the time. The Chief sold 39,000 units within six months of its appearance at the 1926 New York Auto Salon, hitting 76,742 at twelve months. The next year, it became the top-selling six in the U.S., ranking seventh in overall sales. By 1933, it had moved up to producing the least expensive cars available with straight eight engines. This was done by using many components from the 6-cylinder Chevrolet Master, such as the body, but installing a large <b>chrome</b> <b>strip</b> {{on the top and}} center of the front hood Pontiac called the [...] "Silver Streak". In the late 1930s, Pontiac used a Buick [...] "torpedo" [...] body for one of its models, just prior to its being used by Chevrolet, earning some media attention for the marque. An unusual feature of the [...] "torpedo"-bodied exhibition car was that, with push of a button, the front half of the body would open showing the engine and the car's front seat interior. In 1937, the eight-cylinder had a [...] wheelbase, while the six-cylinder had a [...] wheelbase. In 1940, Pontiac introduced the Torpedo as a production model. On 2 February 1942, a Pontiac was the last civilian automobile manufactured in the United States during World War II, as all automobile factories converted to military production.|$|E

50|$|Extensive use {{is made of}} brightwork. Up to four beaded <b>chrome</b> <b>strips</b> {{run along}} the side of the vehicle, as well as ribbed skirt panels. The front grille and {{headlights}} are contained within a distinctive chrome surround which merges with the side brightwork.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, the Odyssey {{was given}} a mild restyle. It {{received}} new, larger Honda emblems for the front and rear, clear-lens tail lights (replacing amber, darker in Absolute trim), and a larger front grille with four <b>chrome</b> <b>strips</b> instead of three {{as well as new}} alloy wheel design options.|$|R

50|$|For the London Motor Show in October 1966 the Mark X {{was renamed}} the Jaguar 420G (not to be {{confused}} with the smaller Jaguar 420). The 420G was distinct from the Mark X only with the addition of a vertical central bar splitting the grille in two, side indicator repeaters on the front wings, and a <b>chrome</b> <b>strip</b> along the wing and door panels (two tone paint schemes were also available with the <b>chrome</b> <b>strip</b> omitted).|$|E
5000|$|For 1969, the Mark II {{range was}} given subtle revisions, with {{separate}} [...] "FORD" [...] block letters {{mounted on the}} bonnet and boot lids, a blacked out grille and <b>chrome</b> <b>strips</b> on top and below the taillights running the full width of the tail panel marking them out.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chrome</b> bumper <b>strips</b> were dropped, {{resulting}} in bumpers that were monochromatic.|$|R
50|$|Anglia saloons were {{provided}} with various levels of trim. The base model was the Standard, and this sported no chromework, painted rear light surrounds, steel slatted grille and limited interior trim. The deluxe had a <b>chrome</b> side <b>strip,</b> <b>chrome</b> rear lights, glovebox lid, sun visor and full width chrome radiator grille. The {{top of the range}} was the Super, which had twin <b>chrome</b> side <b>strips,</b> contrasting coloured roof and side flash, plusher interior trim, together with the 1198 cc engine and a gearbox with synchromesh on first gear.|$|R
50|$|Three {{different}} types of radiator grille were fitted to A54A models. Both the original and the revised E04A grilles were used and a third style, unique to the A54A, was introduced in 1948. This featured a centrally placed vertical <b>chrome</b> <b>strip.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1954 the Imperial Custom {{had a new}} grille {{consisting}} of a heavy wraparound horizontal center bar with five ridges on top and integrated circular signal lights.

However it had center-opening rear doors and Cadillac-like rear fender taillights. Air conditioning was standard on the Imperial Crown [...]|$|E
5000|$|Power {{was down}} to [...] for the 1957 sixth series, with {{increased}} torque to offset the greater weight of the later car. The sixth series coupés had vent windows, and typically a <b>chrome</b> <b>strip</b> down the bonnet. They were the most touring oriented of the B20 series.|$|E
5000|$|The Pacific and Mayfair were {{distinguished}} by {{high levels of}} interior trim: for instance, leather upholstery was provided, and the cars' interior headliners were ornamented with <b>chrome</b> <b>strips</b> intended to suggest a convertible top. The cars were also given innovative exterior color schemes; most were given two-tone paint jobs (for example: [...] "Carnation" [...] (white) and [...] "Amethyst" [...] (lavender)), which were considered fashionable at the time.|$|R
5000|$|The 300 Sc (W188) {{appeared}} in 1955, featuring upgrades to both its engine and suspension. Following the high-performance 300SL Gullwing's lead a year earlier, the Sc's inline-six received {{a version of}} its mechanical direct fuel-injection, which delivered a slightly detuned [...] at 5400 rpm. Mercedes-Benz's [...] "low-pivot" [...] independent suspension was fitted in the rear. Only {{by a pair of}} <b>chrome</b> <b>strips</b> {{on either side of the}} hood visually distinguished it from its precursor.|$|R
5000|$|In 1940, Louis Renault had, {{according}} to one source, directed his engineering team to [...] "make him a car like the Germans'." [...] Until the arrangement was simplified in 1945, the 4CV featured a 'dummy' grille comprising six thin horizontal <b>chrome</b> <b>strips,</b> intended to distract attention from the similarity of the car's overall architecture {{to that of the}} German Volkswagen, while recalling the modern designs of the fashionable front-engined passenger cars produced in Detroit during the earlier 1940s.|$|R
50|$|All Victors {{sported a}} {{different}} grille treatment for 1967, a final-year facelift that was standard Vauxhall {{practice at the}} time. This had a more finished and upmarket look with sturdier bars rather than the cheaper looking criss-cross element on earlier cars. The waistline <b>chrome</b> <b>strip</b> was also thinner.|$|E
5000|$|Other changes: altered trunk layout with {{optional}} power trunk closing assist, flatter rear LED lights {{joined together}} by a continuous <b>chrome</b> <b>strip,</b> redesigned bumper houses two rhomboid tailpipes (except S8), available wheel sizes up to 21 inches with 275/35-series tires, optional sport differential (standard on S8 and A8 4.2 TDI clean diesel quattro) ...|$|E
50|$|A Mk 2 {{version was}} {{introduced}} in mid-1962. Externally {{it is very easy}} to differentiate between Mk1 and Mk2 versions; the Mk1 has the words THAMES TRADER in red on a <b>chrome</b> <b>strip</b> along the bottom of the bonnet opening and the white painted grill between the headlights has a vertical divider with a red circular badge with 4 stars, whereas the Mk2 has just the word THAMES under the bonnet, and TRADER in white letters spaced out between the headlights replacing the divider and badge. The Mk2 Diesel engined variants had either a 4D or 6D chrome badge on each front wing, on the Mk1 it was a squarish chrome badge with either a red painted 4, 6, 4D or 6D to indicate the engine configuration. The lower edge of the badge had a horizontal <b>chrome</b> <b>strip</b> running the length of {{the lower part of the}} wing.|$|E
5000|$|The 4W61 was {{introduced}} in August 1955. The 4W61 changed the grille (with some chrome bars), a one-piece windshield that sits further back when folded, <b>chrome</b> <b>strips</b> on the hood and unequally sized seats (passenger's side is wider than the driver's). The other big change was the engine. The 4W61 was powered by the new 3.7-litre Nissan NB engine, producing , and later was powered by the [...] 4.0-litre Nissan NC engine. The grille badge was chrome and red and said [...] "NISSAN".|$|R
50|$|New Zealand {{assembly}} continued {{again with}} the Super with three-speed manual column-shift transmission though some base models - minus the distinctive waistline <b>chrome</b> <b>strips</b> - were also built for government fleet business. Powerglide two-speed automatic became an option in 1966. The model was facelifted for 1967 and, {{near the end of}} the run, a four-speed manual gearbox with floor shift and twin front seats replaced the three-speeder with bench seat. Some Deluxe models, wagons and VX4/90s were imported fully assembled from the UK but were quite rare.|$|R
50|$|Sport & Style offers {{additional}} features, including 17 inch alloy wheels, chrome roof rail, <b>chrome</b> <b>strips</b> on {{front bumper}} and surrounding side window lining, tinted windows, sport seats with height adjustable lumbar supports center console with folding and height adjustable armrest, folding front passenger seat, drawers under the front seats, folding table and storage pockets {{on the backs}} of the front seats, leather for steering wheel, gear shift knob and gear shift boot, fabric seats with Alcantara accents, cruise control system and tire pressure indicator.|$|R
50|$|In October 1958, the Goliath 1100 was {{replaced}} by the Hansa 1100. Hansa had been the brand name used by the business in the 1930s and 1940s. The new Hansa 1100 used most of the same body panels, but it now featured sharper tailfins and a kinked <b>chrome</b> <b>strip</b> along the car’s flank. An optional Saxomat automatic clutch was offered.|$|E
50|$|Visually, the 220S {{featured}} {{a new one}} piece front bumper, instead of the 3-piece bumper used on the 220a. Also, the twin chrome and rubber strips running under {{the doors of the}} 220a were replaced with solid chrome strips. The most obvious difference is the addition of a <b>chrome</b> <b>strip</b> running along the front fenders and doors of the 220S.|$|E
50|$|The '75 grilles were {{somewhat}} more angular and separated into eight pieces on each side. The parking lights were now {{incorporated into the}} grille. At the rear, new two-piece taillights were divided vertically. The S and Supreme both have a <b>chrome</b> <b>strip</b> atop the bonnet, while the Supreme also has the Oldsmobile logo mounted atop the grille. A fuel economy gauge was optional.|$|E
2500|$|In 1957, the {{historic}} Hudson name came {{only in a}} Hornet version in [...] "Super" [...] and [...] "Custom" [...] series, and available as a four-door sedan or a two-door [...] "Hollywood" [...] hardtop. For the second year the V-Line styling featured an enormous egg-crate grille, creases and <b>chrome</b> <b>strips</b> on the sides, and five tri-tone schemes for the Custom models. There was more ornamentation to the cars, including fender [...] "finettes" [...] atop the rounded rear quarter panels for 1957, as well as very unusual twin-fin trim on top of both front fenders.|$|R
50|$|Its design {{features}} clearly echoed {{those of the}} Elite III but with subtly evolved shape and trim. The windscreen shape was altered {{to have a more}} heavily arched top, with vertical ridges above it where the Elite had had horizontal ridges. The grille surround was integrated with the front bumper, and the panel between the headlights was usually omitted resulting in a larger grille. Side trim generally included two <b>chrome</b> <b>strips</b> along the sides, the lower one having either one or two curved kinks in it. The rear end is less rounded than the Elite's.|$|R
