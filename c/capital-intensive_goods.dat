50|$|One of {{the main}} {{arguments}} in favour of untied aid is that tied aid can create important distortions in the market by {{limiting the number of}} countries where the recipient can make purchases. These limitations impede the recipient country’s ability to find the most cost-effective way to spend the aid they receive. It is estimated that goods and services purchased with tied aid cost 15-30% more than comparable goods and services acquired with untied aid. Furthermore, tied aid often favours <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>goods</b> and advising primarily in the donor country’s area of expertise. That may lead recipient countries to make purchases which are inappropriate for realising their development goals.|$|E

50|$|World {{systems theory}} looks at {{migration}} from a global perspective. It explains that interaction between different societies {{can be an}} important factor in social change within societies. Trade with one country, which causes economic decline in another, may create incentive to migrate to a country with a more vibrant economy. It can be argued that even after decolonization, the economic dependence of former colonies still remains on mother countries. This view of international trade is controversial, however, and some argue that free trade can actually reduce migration between developing and developed countries. It can be argued that the developed countries import labor-intensive goods, which causes an increase in employment of unskilled workers in the less developed countries, decreasing the outflow of migrant workers. The export of <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>goods</b> from rich countries to poor countries also equalizes income and employment conditions, thus also slowing migration. In either direction, this theory can be used to explain migration between countries that are geographically far apart.|$|E
50|$|The {{hypothesis}} was proposed by economist Staffan Burenstam Linder in 1961 {{as a possible}} resolution to the Leontief paradox, which questioned the empirical validity of the Heckscher-Ohlin theory (H-O). H-O predicts that patterns of international trade {{will be determined by}} the relative factor-endowments of different nations. Those with relatively high levels of capital in relation to labor would be expected to produce <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>goods</b> while those with an abundance of labor relative to (immobile) capital would be expected to produce labor-intensive goods. H-O and other theories of factor-endowment based trade had dominated the field of international economics until Leontief performed a study empirically rejecting H-O. In fact, Leontief found that the United States (then the most capital abundant nation) exported primarily labor-intensive goods. Linder proposed an alternative theory of trade that was consistent with Leontief's findings. The Linder hypothesis presents a demand based theory of trade in contrast to the usual supply based theories involving factor endowments. Linder hypothesized that nations with similar demands would develop similar industries. These nations would then trade with each other in similar, but differentiated goods.|$|E

The model combines an endogenous growth framework a la Romer (1986, Journal of Political Economy, 94, pp. 1002 - 1037) with traditional Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson international trade, while assuming investment in capital to be financed solely by domestic savings. This relatively strong assumption is justified by the empirical observation that for most LDCs foreign investment constitutes {{only a very small}} part of gross capital formation. We find that an increase in the price of <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>goods</b> will raise the long-term growth rate. In other words, in this model protection of the <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>goods</b> sector will cause higher economic growth. ...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} has documented a U-shaped industrial concentration curve over an economy`s development path. How far can neoclassical trade theory take us in explaining this pattern? Building on Schott (2003), we estimate the production {{side of the}} Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) model with industry data on 50 developed and developing countries covering the period 1976 - 2000. We allow for multiple cones of specialization, and give special attention to intra-industry factor heterogeneity and to the potentially indeterminate nature of production. For each year, national industries are grouped {{in one of two}} HO aggregates: an aggregate of labor-intensive industries and an aggregate of capital-intensive industries. Decomposing changes in industrial concentration over time, we show that at least 30 % of these changes seems to be explained by the diversification or concentration patterns at the HO-aggregate level. As the combined effect on specialization of changes in technology and relative prices seems to be small, the mechanism we identify is the textbook Rybcynski effect: poor countries accumulating capital have diversified their industrial production by producing more <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>goods,</b> while rich countries accumulating capital have made their production more concentrated by specializing in the production of <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>goods.</b> Economic Growth and International Trade, Heckscher-Ohlin, Multiple Cones, Diversification, Specialization, Industrial Concentration, Structural Change...|$|E

We show that the introduction of status-seeking behavior brings about new properties in equilibrium dynamics. While there exists a continuum of steady states in the standard dynamic models, the present framework demonstrates that, under some conditions, there uniquely exists an incompletely specialized steady state, which is locally saddle-point stable. Therefore, catching-up and overtaking phenomena seen in economic development can be explained, and comparative statics analysis also is made possible. Our comparative statics analysis illustrates, for example, that trade pattern is determined in the Heckscher-Ohlin manner; the patient country acts just like a capital abundant one to export the <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>good.</b> Furthermore, as distinct from the existing literature, the present study shows {{that the existence of}} an incompletely specialized steady state can be ensured even if the two countries conduct different policies.

It shows that if the export subsidies and import tariffs prevail as the Nash equilibrium trade-policy measures in the era before the WTO is established, the enforcement of those WTO rules reduces the volume of trade in goods, expands international capital movement the direction of which is the same as international trade in the <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>good</b> but shrinks international capital movement the direction of which is opposite to it, and the expansion in international capital movement cannot necessarily compensate the loss of world welfare caused by the reduction in international trade in goods and the failure in achieving the Pareto optimu...|$|R
