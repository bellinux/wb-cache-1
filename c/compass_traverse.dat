40|$|Coastal {{exposures}} of the Langkawi {{islands of}} Malaya display an abundant development of hypothermal dikes cutting the granite batholith. These dikes {{have been responsible}} for wide zones of tourmalinization and greisenization of the granite on a spectacular scale. Attention is drawn to the significance of the combined hydrothernml and metasomatic processes in the primary origin of the Malayan tin. ThE Langkawi islands lie 5 miles off the west coast of the Malay Peninsula on latitude with the international boundary between the Federation of Malaya and Thailand at 6 ø N and 100 ø E. The main settlement is the town of Kuah, situated on the south coast of the main island overlooking Bass harbor. This paper describes the coastal section exposed from Kuah jetty in front of the Sanatorium eastwards for one mile. The rocks described form a head-land of low-relief rock exposures that are easily accessible. Figure 1 is a map of the coastal geology produced from a <b>compass</b> <b>traverse</b> made by the authors...|$|E

The writer was employed by the Quebec Bureau of Mir 1 res and worked with Dr W. W.

40|$|The {{area to be}} {{considered}} in this thesis includes most of the townships of Barry, Bailly, and No. 118, and parts of Lacroix, Coursol, Souart, and Nos. 117 and 119, in the County and Territory of Abitibi, northern Quebec. The east-west boundary between the County and the Territory of Quebec crosses the area. The writer was engaged by the Quebec Bureau of Mines to map the geology of this area during the summer of 1939 and was in the field for about four months. During that time the shores of the principal lakes and rivers were examined and the intervening ground covered by means of pace and <b>compass</b> <b>traverses.</b> The land traverses were in general spaced at intervals of about half a mile, but certain areas thought to be practically devoid of outcrops were avoided, or covered only by widely-spaced traverses. Aeroplane photographs of the district were of considerable assistance in the organization of the work. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} based on field work by the writer during the summers of 1948 and 1949, and on {{subsequent}} laboratory investigations at McGill University. The map-area forms part of a concession in New Quebec granted to the Hollinger North Shore Exploration Company Limited. The concession includes part of the “Labrador Trough” which contains a folded and faulted assemblage of Precambrian sedimentary and volcanic rocks (Figure 1). The {{first part of the}} report deals with the general character of the country and the regional geology. The second part is concerned with a detailed study of part of the Kanispiskau system (Late Precambrian) northwest of Attikamagen Lake, and in particular with the iron-formation and the iron ore deposits which occur within it. The field work consisted of detailed mapping in the vicinity of several iron ore occurrences which lie to the northeast of the main ore zone in the Labrador Trough (Figures 2 and 3). Mapping was done by plane-table on the scale one inch equals 200 feet and orientation was maintained from known azimuths of the sun. In addition, a few short pace and <b>compass</b> <b>traverses</b> were made to complete the local geology. Two triangulation stations were erected so that the survey could be tied into the main triangulation system farther west. Accompanying the report are two maps of the local geology on the scale one inch equals 1000 feet. The contours are based on assumed elevations of 1725 feet for Snow and Bruin lakes. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|The Niagara Escarpment is {{generally}} {{viewed as a}} relict landform which shows ancient structural features {{and the effects of}} glaciation. Since it was realized that the Escarpment was not a fault, but instead a feature of erosional origin, little interest has been paid to development of the steep cliffed section of the Niagara Escarpment. This research project has several objectives. The first is an examination {{of the relationship between the}} morphology of the Escarpment and its geological units. This will include analysis of the structure and lithology of each and the geochemistry, especially, of the Queeston Formation. Associated with the examination of morphology and the lithology is a detailed analysis of the slope components that are involved in, or influence mass movements on, the Niagara Escarpment. This analysis centers around the progressively deepening fractures and the detached blocks of the cap rock. Data-gathering methods included fracture surveys, cross sections, and an examination of the bedding. A Wild ‘Total Station’ was used to precisely map the cliffed zone of the escarpment, since available maps are insufficient for any detailed analysis. In addition to the ‘Total Station’, the simpler method of tape and <b>compass</b> <b>traverses</b> was used to add detail to regions of limited accessibility. The process of mapping the cliffed zone of the Escarpment provided a solid basis for constructing a repeatable, measurable data array that has been used to record large scale mass movements. The research questions the validity of using the so-called ‘homoclinical shifting’ model to interpret development along the Niagara Escarpment. It was shown that undercutting by stream and spring sapping are absent from or remote at the study sites. Finally, this work lends support to a new scarp model for the Niagara Escarpment proposed by Hewitt, Saunderson and Hintz (1995) ...|$|R
60|$|As for selfishness, {{one must}} really {{bear in mind}} that men who walked away into that doleful 'urwarld' had need to pray very {{literally}} 'that Christ would guide their feet into the way of peace;' and must have cared as much for their wordly interests as those who march up to the cannon's mouth. Their lives in that forest were not worth twenty-four hours' purchase, and they knew it. It is an ugly thing for an unarmed man, without a <b>compass,</b> to <b>traverse</b> the bush of Australia or New Zealand, where there are no wild beasts. But it was uglier still to start out under the dark roof of that primaeval wood. Knights, when they rode it, went armed cap-a-pie, like Sintram through the dark valley, trusting in God and their good sword. Chapmen and merchants stole through it by a few tracks in great companies, armed with bill and bow. Peasants ventured into it a few miles, to cut timber, and find pannage for their swine, and whispered wild legends of the ugly things therein--and sometimes, too, never came home. Away it stretched from the fair Rhineland, wave after wave of oak and alder, beech and pine, God alone knew how far, into the land of night and wonder, and the infinite unknown; full of elk and bison, bear and wolf, lynx and glutton, and perhaps of worse beasts still. Worse beasts, certainly, Sturmi and his comrades would have met, if they had met them in human form. For there were waifs and strays of barbarism there, uglier far than any waif and stray of civilization, border ruffian of the far west, buccaneer of the Tropic keys, Cimaroon of the Panama forests; men verbiesterte, turned into the likeness of beasts, wildfanger, huner, ogres, wehr-wolves, strong thieves and outlaws, many of them possibly mere brutal maniacs; naked, living in caves and coverts, knowing no law but their own hunger, rage, and lust; feeding often on human flesh; and woe to the woman or child or unarmed man who fell into their ruthless clutch. Orson, and such like human brutes of the wilderness, serve now to amuse children in fairy tales; they were then ugly facts of flesh and blood. There were heathens there, too, in small colonies: heathen Saxons, cruelest of all the tribes; who worshipped at the Irmensul, and had an old blood-feud against the Franks; heathen Thuringer, who had murdered St. Kilian the Irishman at Wurzburg; heathen Slaves, of different tribes, who had introduced into Europe the custom of impaling their captives: and woe to the Christian priest who fell into any of their hands. To be knocked on the head before some ugly idol was the gentlest death which they were like to have. They would have called that martyrdom, and the gate of eternal bliss; but they were none the less brave men for going out to face it.|$|R
