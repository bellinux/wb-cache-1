50|$|Under the NERVA contract, {{the initial}} {{objective}} was to build a rocket engine that could deliver at least 825 seconds of specific impulse, at least 50,000 pounds of thrust, at least 10 minutes of continuous operation at full thrust, and {{have the ability to}} start up on its own with no external energy source. Liquid hydrogen served as the propellant that was supplied to the reactor core by turbopumps and also provided regenerative cooling. The cylindrical graphite core was surrounded by twelve rotating control drums with beryllium on one side to reflect neutrons and boral on the other side to absorb neutrons to control the rate of the nuclear reaction in the core. The core consisted <b>of</b> <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> hexagonal graphite <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> containing pyrographite-coated beads of uranium pellets coated with niobium carbide to prevent corrosion by exposure to the hydrogen propellant. Each fuel rod cluster was supported by an inconel tie rod.

40|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} {{for space}} research purposes should {{be equipped with}} incore <b>fuel</b> <b>elements.</b> In that connection the question was studied if incore <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> might also be applied for economic electricity generation, because they lead {{to increase the efficiency}} rate of the total power plant. The computation of a high-temperature reactor of 600 MW(e) showed that for the wanted thermal neutron spectrum at which radiation damalte <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> can be kept possibly low, the parasitic absorption in the structure materials tungsten and niobium will be too high. In order to achieve reactor criticality, a high fission inventory is required.

40|$|New {{semi-automatic}} search {{options for}} maximum keff of systems having a given number <b>of</b> fixed composition <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> were successfully developed for SMORES – a new prototypic analysis sequence of SCALE- 5. 0. They {{are useful for}} identifying that distance between the <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> {{that will result in}} maximum keff. The new optimization algorithms were tested by applying them to identify the maximum keff thermal systems could have when made of a given number <b>of</b> fixed composition <b>fuel</b> <b>elements,</b> a moderator and a reflector. It was found that the optimal systems generally feature non-uniform spacing <b>of</b> the <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> – the optimal spacing tends to increase from the center towards the reflector. The spacing non-uniformity depends on the combination of moderator and reflector materials, on the number <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> in the system and on the reflector thickness. The general trend is increasing spacing width with reduction in the number <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> slabs and with reduction in reflector thickness. Particularly large can be the spacing of the outermost to the next-to-outermost <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> when using very low absorbing moderator, such as graphite, along with a relatively absorbing reflector such as water. When using a thick low absorbing reflector, such as graphite, the spacing <b>of</b> the <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> is nearly uniform and only slightly larger than the optimal spacing in an infinite lattice. Otherwise the optimal spacing can be significantly larger than the optimal infinite lattice spacing. Key Words: Maximum keff; Optimization; SMORES; SCALE- 5. 0 1...|$|R
