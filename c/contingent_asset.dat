The answers found in this analysis were applied in the elucidation of accounting procedures. We used descriptive research, legal dialectics and discourse analysis, along with aspects of tax accounting to address the identification of relevant aspects of the improper tax. The main base is discourse analysis to identify the problem of improper tax. The results show that, from the analysis of speech into five categories presented at the National Tax Code, it was possible to analyze the different discourses of the authors and researchers of the tax law.

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{transition}} from an economy characterized by idiosyncratic income shocks and incomplete markets a la Aiyagari (1994) to markets where statecontingent assets are available but costly (in order to purchase a <b>contingent</b> <b>asset,</b> households {{have to pay a}} xed participation cost) leads to a large increase of wealth inequality. Using a standard calibration our model can match a Gini of 0. 93 close to the level of wealth inequality observed in the US. In addition, under this level of participation costs, wealth inequality is particularly sensitive to income inequality. We label this phenomenon as the Inequality Accelerator. We demonstrate how costly access to contingent asset-markets generates these e ects. The key insight stems from the non-monotonic relationship between wealth and desired degree of insurance, in an economy with participation costs. Poor borrowing constrained households remain uninsured, middle-class households are almost perfectly insured, while rich households decide to self-insure by purchasing risk-free assets. This feature of households' risk management has crucial e ects in asset prices, wealth inequality, and social mobility. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{extends the}} Robbins and Pearce (1992) {{two-stage}} turnaround response model to include governance factors. In addition to retrenchment and recovery, the paper proposes {{the addition of}} a realignment stage, referring specifically to the realignment of expectations of principal and agent groups. The realignment stage imposes a threshold that must be crossed before the retrenchment and hence recovery stage can be entered. Crossing this threshold is problematic {{to the extent that the}} interests of governance-stakeholder groups diverge in a crisis situation. The severity of the crisis impacts on the bases of strategy <b>contingent</b> <b>asset</b> valuation leading to the fragmentation of stakeholder interests. In some cases the consequence may be that management are prevented from carrying out turnarounds by governance constraints. The paper uses a case study to illustrate these dynamics, and like the Robbins and Pearce study, it focuses on the textile industry. A longitudinal approach is used to show the impact of the removal of governance constraints. The empirical evidence suggests that such financial constraints become less serious to the extent that there is a functioning market for corporate control. Building on governance research and turnaround literature, the paper also outlines the general case necessary and sufficient conditions for successful turnarounds.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} {{analyzes}} how default externalities {{lead to an}} excessive incidence of systemic private debt crises. An individual defaulting borrower does not internalize that her default leads to a depreciation in the exchange rate because international lenders will sell any seizable assets and flee the country. The exchange rate depreciation in turn reduces the value of non-tradable collateral and induces other borrowers to default, leading to a chain reaction of defaults. The inefficiency of default spillovers can be corrected by strengthening the enforcement of creditor rights, so that private individual borrowers have less incentives to default, reducing the incidence of systemic default episodes. The second chapter analyzes the implications of developing financial markets for <b>contingent</b> <b>assets</b> {{on the degree of}} risk sharing, the incidence of systemic financial crises and credit externalities through collateral prices in emerging economies with limited access to international capital markets. We find that, in an environment with persistent shocks and collateral constraints, even though agents cannot engage in full risk sharing, access to state <b>contingent</b> <b>assets</b> improves the degree of hedging, reduces the need for precautionary savings and lowers the incidence of financial crises. In addition, it further reduces the spillover effect of credit externalities by dampening the effect of an individual's borrowing on the valuation of collateral of other borrowers...|$|R

40|$|It is {{believed}} that a shock, common {{to a set of}} countries with identical fundamentals, has identical outcomes across countries.

This is the case even if state <b>contingent</b> <b>assets</b> can be traded across countries. The transmission mechanism of a monetary shock in a monetary union has in this case an additional channel, the terms of trade.

40|$|Although {{the main}} {{interest}} in the modelling of electricity prices is often on volatility aspects, we argue that stochastic heteroskedastic behaviour in prices can only be modelled correctly when the conditional mean of the time series is properly modelled. In this paper we consider different periodic extensions of regression models with autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average disturbances {{for the analysis of}} daily spot prices of electricity. We show that day-of-the-week periodicity and long memory are important determinants for the dynamic modelling of the conditional mean of electricity spotprices. Once an effective description of the conditional mean of spot prices is empirically identified, focus can be directed towards volatility features of the time series. For the older electricity market of Nord Pool in Norway, it is found that a long memory model with periodic coefficients is required to model daily spot prices effectively. Further, strong evidence of conditional heteroskedasticity is found in the mean corrected Nord Pool series. For daily prices at three emerging electricity markets that we consider (APX in The Netherlands, EEX in Germany and Powernext in France) periodicity in the autoregressive coefficients is also established, but evidence of long memory is not found and existence of dynamic behaviour in the variance of the spot prices is less pronounced. The novel findings in this paper can have important consequences for the modelling and forecasting of mean and variance functions of spot prices for electricity and associated <b>contingent</b> <b>assets.</b> Autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average model; Generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model; Long memory process; Periodic autoregressive model; Volatility. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the study}} was to explore and compare {{reporting}} practices on provisions for liabilities in different countries. Methodology: The research was limited to the types of provisions that are addressed in the International Accounting Standard 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and <b>Contingent</b> <b>Assets.</b> For the purpose of the study, financial statements of the biggest public companies in Great Britain, Germany and Poland have been chosen to be taken into consideration. The following detailed issues have been explored: - Presentation of the types of provisions in a statement of financial position and additional notes to a financial statement, - Presentation of the amounts of provisions made, used, and reversed during a given period and the effects of changes in the discount rate, - Scope and quality of descriptions of the nature of obligations presented by entities. The results of the analysis have been viewed from two perspectives - the areas of compliance and non-compliance of reporting on provisions with IFRS have been identified and a comparison of the extent of compliance with particular requirements between companies from different countries has been developed.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to our understanding}} of compliance with mandatory accounting standards. Specifically, we examine the efficacy of agency related mechanisms on the degree of disclosure compliance with the MASB accounting standards. Using data drawn from a sample of 170 Malaysian companies listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) in 2004, we show that although overall disclosure compliance is high (85. 2 % of the items of information being disclosed), companies do not fully comply with MASB 10 (Accounting for leases), MASB 11 (Consolidated financial statements and investments in subsidiaries), MASB 12 (Investments in Associates), MASB 15 (Property, plant and equipment), MASB 20 (Provisions, contingent liabilities and <b>contingent</b> <b>assets),</b> MASB 24 (financial instruments), MASB 27 (Borrowing costs) and MASB 29 (Employee benefits). We employ an ordinary least square (OLS) regression model to establish whether selected company-specific and corporate governance characteristics (proxying for agency-related mechanisms) are related to the degree of disclosure compliance. Our results indicate that only leverage is positively associated with the degree of compliance. The other variables consisting of board independence, audit committee independence, the existence of qualified accountant in the audit committee, CEO duality, management ownership, the extent of outside blockholders’ ownership, ownership structure, firm size, scope of business, industry type, profitability and type of external auditor do not show any significant relationship with degree of compliance. These results have important implications for policy because they suggest that whilst agency-related mechanisms may motivate compliance with mandatory standards, full compliance may be unattainable without regulations...|$|R

The main result is that the set of equilibrium prices of the assets at a given state s can be characterized by the concept of the core applied to a cooperative game where the states of nature are players and the value of a coalition E (which is an event) is the amount of money in the hands of agents who know at the state s that E has occurred. Thus, {{the way in which the}} knowledge of agents restricts the set of trades can be captured by the concept of the core.

By statistically examining accounting and share data for 56 companies listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm, {{the question of whether}} accounting information regarding provisions are value relevant for investors is studied. Listed companies shall follow the rules of IAS 37 – Provisions, Contingent liabilities and <b>Contingent</b> <b>assets,</b> when preparing financial statements. Aim: The purpose of this thesis is {{to examine the relationship between}} reported information about provisions and investors assessment of listed companies that comply with IFRS-regulations, by statistically testing the value relevance of the accounting entry. Method: The study is based on a quantitative, deductive methodological approach. The value relevance of provisions is examined by statistically testing the collected empirical data based on the two models that is described in the reference frame. Results: The conclusion to be drawn from the study is that reported provisions have no statistically significant association with return on shares and thus is not value relevant. The study shows a correlation between reported earnings and returns, which is in line with previous studies. Suggestions for future research: Based on the statistical tests, the study has revealed that the accounting entry provisions are not value relevant for investors. Something that could be interesting to further explore is why provisions are not value relevant. I also think it would have been interesting to closer examine which components of the reported results that are related to the return on the company's shares. A suggestion could be to examine this by combining a quantitative statistical study with qualitative interviews to gain a deeper understanding of the relationships that might arise...|$|R
