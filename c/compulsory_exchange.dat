To establish a system of <b>compulsory</b> Labour <b>Exchanges</b> in order to eliminate casual labour, and so to divide among a certain proportion of workers all available employment, would be absolutely and totally to cast out at the other end a surplus of unemployed: and to do this before preparations have been made for dealing with that surplus, would be to court an administrative breakdown which could not fail to be attended with the gravest possible disaster. Until poor law reform has made further progress, to establish a compulsory system of Labour Exchanges would only increase and not diminish the miseries with which we are seeking to cope.|$|R

[...] The agreement defined the groups subject to exchange as Muslim and Greek Orthodox. This classification follows the lines drawn by the millet system of the Ottoman Empire.

5000|$|After {{pressure}} by Italian and Albanian delegates which made {{a case that}} the Chams primarily self-identified as Albanian nationals, Greece accepted in 1925, {{two years after the}} exchange had officially begun, that Muslim Chams were not subject to the exchange.

But Muslim Chams had to prove their ethnic origin in order to remain in Greece. According to the Greek decision, which was presented by Eleftherios Venizelos to the local administration in Epirus, only those who were born in Albania or whose fathers were born in Albania could stay in Greece, thus excluding the genuine Chams of the Chameria region. On the other hand the Albanian state insisted that the Chams were forced to leave Greece because the Greek authorities were making life [...] "unbearable" [...] for them.|$|E
50|$|The {{architect}} of the exchange was Fridtjof Nansen, commissioned by the League of Nations. As the first official high commissioner for refugees, Nansen proposed and supervised the exchange, {{taking into account the}} interests of Greece, Turkey, and West European powers. As an experienced diplomat with experience resettling Russian and other refugees after the First World War, Nansen had also created a new travel document for displaced persons of the World War in the process. He was chosen {{to be in charge of}} the peaceful resolution of the Greek-Turkish war of 1919-22. Although a <b>compulsory</b> <b>exchange</b> on this scale had never been attempted in modern history, Balkan precedents, such as the Greco-Bulgarian population exchange of 1919, were available. Because of the unanimous decision by the Greek and Turkish governments that minority protection would not suffice to ameliorate ethnic tensions after the First World War, population exchange was promoted as the only viable option.|$|E
50|$|The {{first wave}} of {{immigrants}} from Bulgaria occurred during the Russo-Turkish War (1828-1829) when around 30,000 Bulgarian Turks arrived in Turkey. The second wave of about 750,000 immigrants left Bulgaria during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, but approximately one-fourth of them died on the way. More than 200,000 of the rest remained inside the present borders of Turkey whilst the others were sent {{to other parts of}} the Ottoman Empire. The aftermath of the war led to major demographic restructuring of the ethnic and religious make-up of Bulgaria. As a result of these migrations, the percentage of Turks in Bulgaria was reduced from more than one-third of the population immediately after the Russo-Turkish War to 14.2% in 1900. Substantial numbers of Turks continued to emigrate to Turkey during, and following, the Balkan Wars and the First World War, in accordance with <b>compulsory</b> <b>exchange</b> of population agreements between Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey. By 1934 the Turkish population fell to 9.7% of Bulgaria’s total population and continued to fall during the subsequent decades.|$|E

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. In my Masters Thesis, I examine the 1923 <b>Compulsory</b> Population <b>Exchange</b> between Greece and Turkey (CEOPBGT). Endorsed at a {{convention}} in Lausanne, Switzerland, the forced transfer of {{over one million}} Anatolian Greek Christians from Turkey to Greece, and of roughly 400, 000 Greek Muslims from Greece to Turkey, occurred during a period when Turkey and Greece were actively pursuing nation-building projects. In my theory, I inform about the downside of state-centric security rhetoric and ethnonationalism associated with population expulsion. In my case study, I specifically address the Lausanne Convention’s role in "nationalizing" identity and defining who belongs and who does not in nationally particularistic ways. My investigation seeks to illustrate that the national territorial narrative produced by the CEOPBGT was in discord with how transferees comprehended {{their own sense of}} community and place in the world. To this end, I provide evidence such as stories of the Greek Muslim migration to show how displacement distorts, challenges and negotiates a migrant’s sense of identity and security. Ultimately, I hope that my thesis may add a unique perspective to the current literature seeking to understand sources of the politicized conflict between Greece and Turkey, as well as offering general insight into the International Relations discipline regarding the phenomenon of forced population transfer.

40|$|Mubadele/Antallage is a fifty-minute cantata {{for large}} {{ensemble}} of 14 players, two singers and a narrator. The piece {{is based on}} real life stories of an Orthodox Christian and a Muslim woman who were subjected to forced migration with {{the enactment of the}} Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 : an agreement, following the 1919 - 1922 Greco-Turkish war, that decreed the <b>compulsory</b> <b>exchange</b> of religious minority populations in Greece and Turkey. As a result, almost {{a million and a half}} Orthodox Christians residing in Turkey and half a million Muslims residing in Greece were uprooted from the lands on which they lived for generations, forcefully sent to the opposite country, and rendered as refugees. The agreement not only caused a radical shift in the entire demographics of Near East, homogenizing and ethnically cleansing the region, but also marked a milestone in the nationalization and modernization processes of the two countries, thus reshaping the nationalist discourses, as well as the cultural and national identities of Greeks and Turks. In this musical composition I have constructed a libretto that displays the stories of these two women - reflecting their personal accounts, traumas and reactions to the political turmoil that revolves around them, whereas the music mediates the cultural and linguistic differences, thus transcending this divergence and working as a site of cultural convergence where these two women meet. The piece unfolds in two formal sections: Arias and narrations. The narration parts, accompanied by little or no music, are English-spoken sections that depict the stories of the two characters. The arias, sung in Greek and Turkish, are emotionally focused movements. This linguistically shaped formal scheme coupled with a Western musical medium seeks to manipulate not only the interplay between the folkloric materials from Greece and Turkey but also explore the possibilities of interaction, fusion, and synthesis of Western/non-Western and modern/traditional musical and narrative elements...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of civil society in facilitating intergenerational {{contracts}} governing investments in schooling and the payment of social security {{in the form of}} re-mittances. In advanced economies, the state facilitates a political equilibrium, the inter-generational contract, where the middle-aged pay for <b>compulsory</b> schooling in <b>exchange</b> for receiving social security paid by taxes when old. However, in less developed economies intergenerational contracts are generally thought to be governed by informal institutions such as social norms. We show that this is indeed the case in rural Tanzania: civil society, measured by village level tribal fractionalization, matters for the enforcement of the inter-generational contract. Less fractionalized villages are characterized both by higher rates of school enrollment and higher remittances, controlling for schooling. Ruling out alterna-tive explanations, we conclude that intergenerational contracts are feasible even without a strong state...|$|R

500|$|At {{the same}} time the war had since the 1620s caused {{significant}} expenses for the cities, e.g. for building better defenses such as new bastions. A significant source of income for the cantons ran dry: their financial means exhausted by the war, France and Spain no longer paid the Pensions, the agreed sums in return for the cantons providing them with mercenary regiments. The city authorities tried to compensate for this and to cover their expenses on the one hand by increasing the taxes or inventing new ones {{and on the other hand}} by minting less valuable copper coins [...] called Batzen that had the same face value as the previously minted silver money. The population began hoarding the silver coins, and the cheap copper money that remained in circulation continually lost in purchasing power. Zürich, Basel, and the central Swiss cantons therefore began already in 1623 to mint more valuable coins again. Bern and also Solothurn and Fribourg set a <b>compulsory</b> fixed <b>exchange</b> rate between copper and silver money instead, but this measure did not break the de facto devaluation. At the end of the war, the population thus faced both a postwar depression and a high inflation, combined with high taxes. This financial crisis led to a series of tax revolts in several cantons of the Confederacy, for instance 1629–36 in Lucerne, 1641 in Bern, or 1645/46 in Zürich. The uprising in 1653 continued this series, but would take the conflict to an unprecedented level.|$|R
