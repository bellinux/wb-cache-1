40|$|This study {{deals with}} some {{particular}} features of commercial arbitration in Austria. The legal framework of arbitration in Austria was changed with {{an effect of}} 1 st July, 2006, as the Austrian Parliament passed the Schiedsrechts-Änderungsgesetz 2006 in December 2005. This act was proclaimed on the 13 th January 2006 and entered into force 1 st July {{in spite of the}} planned date of 1 st January. After having described the significance of arbitration in Austria the author pays special attention to the topic of appointment and <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators.</b> The author compares the rules of the valid Austrian act with the provisions of UNCITRAL Model Law adopted on 21 st June, 1985. The author highlights some cases from the legal practice which are considered relevant in the present issue. Finally the author summarizes the provisions of the rules of procedure of International Arbitral Centre of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber {{from the point of view}} of appointment and <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators,</b> which rules have been effective also since 1 st July, 2006...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{discusses}} some important questions on arbitration in Latin-America {{focusing on the}} issue of appointment and <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators.</b> The author attempts to describe some characteristic features of arbitration in Latin-America paying particular attention to the impact of the Calvo Doctrine and Calvo Clause. The author also discusses the significance of the so-called compromiso (or in Portuguese: compromisso). The author gives a detailed analysis on the appointment and <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators</b> in the legal system of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico, highlighting also some leading cases in this issue. The study enumerates some important arbitration institutes in these countries, as well. The author puts emphasis on introducing the legal regulation on arbitration of the foregoing countries taking into consideration the legal tradition, which might have significant influence on the present legislation and legal practice, as well. As the law on arbitration in some of the foregoing countries in many aspects follow the regulations of UNCITRAL Model Law, the author tries to compare the analyzed acts with the UNCITRAL Model Law, which served and serves as a guideline for arbitration law in several countries of Latin America...|$|E
40|$|The article {{examines}} the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), dealing first with its history and its organization {{and then with the}} most relevant procedural issues that are encountered in CAS arbitration proceedings. In particular, the article explores some of the features which characterize and distinguish the CAS ordinary arbitration procedure, the CAS appeals arbitration procedure and the CAS Olympic arbitration procedure. Important procedural topics such as jurisdictional and admissibility issues, the appointment and <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators,</b> the participation of third parties in CAS proceedings and the granting of interim measures are analyzed in depth. Evidentiary issues are also examined in detail, with particular reference to burden of proof, witness statements and discovery.

40|$|This Essay {{builds on}} the {{available}} literature to date and offers a more probing examination <b>of</b> the international <b>arbitrator</b> and nationality. The opening section reiterates how arbitrator nationality relates to the traditional requirements <b>of</b> <b>arbitrator</b> impartiality, independence, and neutrality (with which the 2 ̆ 2 arbitrator 2 ̆ 2 is most synonymous); how arbitral rules seek diversity of nationality between the tribunal and the parties; the underlying reasons for national neutrality being the accepted practice in international arbitration; and criticisms of the practice. With this background in place, the Essay poses challenging questions relating to the arbitrator 2 ̆ 7 s nationality, {{with the aid of}} hypothetical permutations of an international arbitration matter. The hypothetical, which will offer varying descriptions <b>of</b> prospective <b>arbitrators</b> 2 ̆ 7 nationality and national affiliation, will inspire further discussion on the always difficult issues <b>of</b> party <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arbitrator</b> and the arbitrator 2 ̆ 7 s disclosures. The hypothetical will be put to the test in a survey of international arbitration attorneys from one country asked to give their reactions to prospective arbitrators who have varying degrees of association to another country. Given the sensitivity to national identification in the international commercial arbitration arena, the matter of the nationality <b>of</b> the <b>arbitrator</b> will continue to be of interest...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the nationality <b>of</b> the <b>arbitrator</b> in the international setting. International arbitrators are required to be independent and impartial. Neutrality is also presumed, and is generally understood to mean national neutrality. That is, the wide practice {{has been that the}} arbitrator (or the chair of a three-arbitrator tribunal) must be of a different nationality than that of either party). As background, the article discusses how arbitral rules seek diversity of nationality between the tribunal and the parties, the underlying reasons for national neutrality, and criticisms of the general practice. The discussion then poses challenging questions relating to the arbitrator’s nationality, with the aid of hypothetical permutations of an arbitration matter. The hypothetical will inspire further discussion on the always difficult issues <b>of</b> party <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arbitrator</b> and the arbitrators’ disclosures. The article also reports the results of a revealing survey of international arbitration attorneys from one country asked to give their reactions to prospective arbitrators with varying degrees of association to another country. Given the sensitivity to national identification in the international commercial arbitration arena, the matter of the nationality <b>of</b> the <b>arbitrator</b> will continue to be of interest...|$|R
40|$|A. Background and Purpose In International Commercial Arbitration, {{sometimes}} neither party’s submissions {{correspond to}} the arbitral tribunal’s view of the case. In such a situation, the arbitral tribunal must know its powers. To what extent may it independently evaluate the case? Must the arbitral tribunal stick to the parties’ factual and legal submission? Must it follow their claims for relief? Or may the arbitral tribunal assess {{the facts of the}} case and the law free from any constraints set by the parties? To what extent may and must the arbitral tribunal explain its view of the facts and the law to the parties before it renders the award? Shortly, what is the relation between Jura novit curia and Party Autonomy in International Commercial Arbitration? This article presents the German perspective on Jura novit curia in International Commercial Arbitration. It exhibits the status quo, as to which limits exist on the principle of Jura novit curia in arbitration from the perspective of Germany. B. Structure and Method The article first sets out a working definition of Jura novit curia (Part II). It then examines the impact of the 1958 United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (hereinafter the 1958 New York Convention or NYC), of the German arbitration law, and of prominent German arbitration institution rules on Jura novit curia (Part III). In a third step, it presents the other legal sources used regarding Jura novit curia and the results of an empirical analysis of how the different actors in arbitration behave (Part IV). Finally, we conclude that the working definition of Jura novit curia largely, but not entirely corresponds to the understanding of Jura novit curia in German law (Part V). We analyzed the case law German courts established in proceedings on declaration of enforceability and setting aside the award respectively, and proceedings on the <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators.</b> We found forty-seven cases concerning Jura novit curia, of which twenty-six referred to the right to a fair hearing...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> <b>arbitrators</b> for bias is on {{the rise}} in international commercial arbitration. Bias challenges are now used tactically to delay arbitral proceedings and deprive the other side <b>of</b> the <b>arbitrator</b> <b>of</b> their choice. There are two main streams of common law authority on the test to be applied to an allegation of apparent bias: the Sussex Justices ‘reasonable apprehension’test and the Gough ‘real danger’ test. At different times and places, both tests have been applied to arbitrators. This paper traces the English development of the competing tests and their uptake in the common law states in the Asia Pacific region that have adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (1985). It concludes with legal and policy-based arguments for the application of the Gough ‘real danger’ test to arbitrators in international disputes...|$|R
50|$|Any {{party to}} the dispute can start the process <b>of</b> {{appointing}} <b>arbitrator</b> and if the other party does not cooperate, the party can approach the office of Chief Justice for appointment <b>of</b> an <b>arbitrator.</b> There are only two grounds upon which a party can <b>challenge</b> the appointment <b>of</b> an <b>arbitrator</b> - reasonable doubt in the impartiality <b>of</b> the <b>arbitrator</b> and the lack of proper qualification <b>of</b> the <b>arbitrator</b> as required by the arbitration agreement. A sole arbitrator or a panel <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators</b> so appointed constitute the Arbitration Tribunal.|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} several years, many FINRA {{arbitration}} cases have been filed against Morgan Keegan, a regional investment firm. The cases are heard in {{a small number of}} locations with relatively small arbitrator rosters. On February 25, 2010, a Tennessee Chancery court vacated a FINRA arbitration award against Morgan Keegan citing the presence <b>of</b> two <b>arbitrators</b> who served on other Morgan Keegan cases involving the same products in the dispute before it. On March 2, 2010, another court denied the identical motion to vacate by Morgan Keegan in a separate arbitration where an award was granted against Morgan Keegan. Responding to the uncertainty concerning the finality of arbitration awards in such cases, FINRA has sought to solve the problem by recommending that parties avail themselves of FINRA rules for challenging arbitrator appointments. Unfortunately, each of the likely players in such arbitration disputes—investment firms and investors—has significant incentive problems from the perspective <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> <b>arbitrator</b> appointment. This Note argues that FINRA may be more successful in addressing challenges to arbitration awards by screening arbitrators to automatically eliminate those who have presided or are currently presiding over cases involving identical products and parties. Part I of this Note summarizes the mechanics <b>of</b> FINRA <b>arbitrator</b> selections and identifies the methods through which parties may challenge arbitrator appointment. Part II explores the result <b>of</b> such <b>challenges</b> in the Morgan Keegan line of cases, reviews the subsequent impact on FINRA proceedings, and outlines an alternative “auction rate case” model <b>of</b> screening <b>arbitrators.</b> Finally, Part III argues for an arbitrator selection system featuring the automatic screening method based on the “auction rate case” model as the solution to the basic risk inherent in high volumes of cases based on singular financial products...|$|R
