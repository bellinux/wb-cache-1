50|$|<b>Creams</b> <b>are</b> {{semi-solid}} emulsions {{of oil and}} water. They {{are divided}} into two types: oil-in-water (O/W) <b>creams</b> which <b>are</b> composed of small droplets of oil dispersed in a continuous phase, and water-in-oil (W/O) <b>creams</b> which <b>are</b> composed of small droplets of water dispersed in a continuous oily phase. Oil-in-water <b>creams</b> <b>are</b> more comfortable and cosmetically acceptable as they are less greasy and more easily washed off using water. Water-in-oil <b>creams</b> <b>are</b> more difficult to handle but many drugs which <b>are</b> incorporated into <b>creams</b> <b>are</b> hydrophobic and will be released more readily from a water-in-oil cream than an oil-in-water <b>cream.</b> Water-in-oil <b>creams</b> <b>are</b> also more moisturising as they provide an oily barrier which reduces water loss from the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the skin.|$|R

5|$|Clam dip is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or minced clams, sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel. Canned, cooked, and frozen or fresh clams may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by steaming or pan cooking. Canned clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may thicken, and the liquid from canned clams can be used to thin the dip. Milk or <b>cream</b> <b>is</b> also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, the flavors of the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the dip. The clams can be smoked in the shell and then minced afterward.|$|E

5|$|Durian {{fruit is}} used to flavour {{a wide variety of}} sweet edibles such as {{traditional}} Malay candy, ice kacang, dodol, lempuk, rose biscuits, ice cream, milkshakes, mooncakes, Yule logs, and cappuccino.

Pulut Durian or ketan durian is glutinous rice steamed with coconut milk and served with ripened durian. In Sabah, red durian is fried with onions and chilli and served as a side dish. Red-fleshed durian is traditionally added to sayur, an Indonesian soup made from freshwater fish. Ikan brengkes tempoyak is fish cooked in a durian-based sauce, traditional in Sumatra.

Cold borscht blended with sour <b>cream</b> <b>is</b> also popular on Shavuot (Feast of Weeks), a holiday customarily associated with dairy foods, observed in late May or early June. Seudah Shlishit, or the third meal of the Shabbat, often includes borscht as well.|$|E
5|$|The American <b>Cream</b> <b>is</b> {{the only}} breed of draft horse {{developed}} in the United States that is still in existence today. The breed descends from a foundation mare named Old Granny. She was probably foaled between 1900 and 1905, and was first noticed at an auction in Story County, Iowa, in 1911 and purchased by Harry Lakin, a well known stock dealer. She was eventually sold to Nelson Brothers Farm in Jewell, Iowa. Her breeding is not known, but she was cream-colored and many of her foals were as well; they sold for above-average prices because of their color. Her cream-colored coat, pink skin and amber eyes are defining standards for the breed, and the color {{is now known as}} gold champagne. In 1946, two years after the breed registry was formed, 98 percent of the horses registered could be traced back to Old Granny.|$|E

5|$|Hershey Creamery Company, {{also known}} as Hershey's Ice <b>Cream,</b> <b>is</b> a creamery that {{produces}} Hershey's brand ice cream, sorbet, sherbet, and frozen yogurt, and other frozen treats such as smoothies and frozen slab style ice cream mixers. Founded by Jacob Hershey and four of his brothers in 1894 (all of whom have no relation to Milton S. Hershey and the chocolate company that he founded, also in 1894), it {{was taken over by}} the Holder family in the 1920s. The company {{was one of the first}} to offer consumers pre-packaged ice cream pints. In 1998, it modernized its operations to increase efficiency and reduce overhead. With their shared names and cities of origin, Hershey Creamery and Hershey Company have had a tumultuous relationship marked by multiple lawsuits over trademark issues. In the mid-1990s, the companies settled their most recent legal battles out of court, with the creamery agreeing to add a disclaimer to its ice cream products to note that it is not affiliated with The Hershey Company.|$|E

40|$|In this ever-advancing global world, {{people are}} mindful to beauty and well-being. As a result, the {{market share of}} beauty {{products}} is increasing radically. Therefore, several skin-lightening products are commercially on hand to get lighter skin tone. Clinically, such <b>creams</b> <b>are</b> prescribed to treat hyper pigmentation disorders [1]. Even in the cosmetics market, numerous functional products such as those developed for skin moisturizing, skin whitening, wrinkle care and anti-ageing have been launched. The misleading advertisements and irrational use of such creams often leads to adverse consequences to human skin. For that reason, {{the aim of this}} study was to assess the depigmenting efficacy of branded skin-lightening creams in-vivo (human). Owing to this, four branded <b>creams</b> <b>were</b> used, coded as P- 1, P- 2, P- 3 and P- 4. Prior to in-vivo evaluation, physicochemical characterization and in-vitro stability studies of all the <b>creams</b> <b>were</b> performed to ensure the quality of the creams. In-vivo evaluation of the <b>creams</b> <b>was</b> carried out in 36 healthy human volunteers. The volunteers were screened for any reaction to cream using patch test (Burchard test). The <b>creams</b> <b>were</b> applied on cheeks twice a day for 8 weeks. The skin measurements for melanin, erythema, sebum content and trans epidermal water loss (TEWL) were recorded using mexameter, sebumeter and tewameter respectively. In addition, increase in skin moisture content was measured using corneometer. The measurements were taken at the end of week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8. Lastly, panel test was conducted to assess the volunteers’ sensory evaluation of the creams.
