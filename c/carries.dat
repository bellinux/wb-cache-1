40|$|<b>Carry</b> select adder is a square-root time {{high-speed}} adder. In this paper, FPGA-based {{synthesis of}} conventional and hybrid <b>carry</b> select adders are described {{with a focus}} on high speed. Conventionally, <b>carry</b> select adders are realized using the following: (i) full adders and 2 [*]:[*] 1 multiplexers, (ii) full adders, binary to excess 1 code converters, and 2 [*]:[*] 1 multiplexers, and (iii) sharing of common Boolean logic. On the other hand, hybrid <b>carry</b> select adders involve a combination of <b>carry</b> select and <b>carry</b> lookahead adders with/without the use of binary to excess 1 code converters. In this work, two new hybrid <b>carry</b> select adders are proposed involving the <b>carry</b> select and section-carry based <b>carry</b> lookahead subadders with/without binary to excess 1 converters. Seven different <b>carry</b> select adders were implemented in Verilog HDL and their performances were analyzed under two scenarios, dual-operand addition and multioperand addition, where individual operands are of sizes 32 and 64 -bits. In the case of dual-operand additions, the hybrid <b>carry</b> select adder comprising the proposed <b>carry</b> select and section-carry based <b>carry</b> lookahead configurations is the fastest. With respect to multioperand additions, the hybrid <b>carry</b> select adder containing the <b>carry</b> select and conventional <b>carry</b> lookahead or section-carry based <b>carry</b> lookahead structures produce similar optimized performance...|$|R
