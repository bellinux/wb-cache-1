5|$|In the French sources, one {{important}} discussion {{has centered on}} the question of whether the Natchez planned a simultaneous attack on the French with the other major tribes of the region. French colonial governor Étienne Périer, in a report to superiors in France written one week after the revolt, claimed that many of the Indian nations in the lower Mississippi Valley had plotted with the Natchez to attack the French on the same day and that even the Choctaw, who had been close allies of the French, were part of the plot. Périer then cancelled a meeting with the Choctaw planned for the first two days of December in New Orleans, contending that it was to be the occasion for an attack. Périer in this way defended his actions as governor by insinuating that the results of the massacre <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>worse</b> if not for his prompt action. However, historians Gordon Sayre and Arnaud Balvay have pointed out that Jean-Baptiste Delaye, a militia commander in the French retaliations following the massacre, wrote in a 1730 unpublished narrative that Périer's claims were groundless, and that the Tioux, Yazoo, and other nations were not complicit and had no foreknowledge of the attack. Another document in French, of anonymous authorship, asserted that the Natchez revolt was a British plan to destroy a new French tobacco business in Louisiana.|$|E

Sir Alan doubted any pitch of hers <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>worse</b> than Kevin's, after noting that the theme had doomed the team, but advised her to step up if a similar situation arose again.|$|E
25|$|Gibraltar were humiliated by Canada: Abraham took 5-9 as the Gibraltarians were {{dismissed}} for 46, the lowest total of the tournament, and it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>worse</b> {{as they were}} 17/7 at one point. In reply the Canadians smashed 48 from just 23 balls to record the easiest of ten-wicket wins. CAC Browne made 57 as Fiji posted a competitive total of 251 against the United States, but an unbeaten 104 by Lashkari and 74 from Kamran Rasheed ensured a five-wicket win for the Americans. The Dutch put on 200 for the second wicket against Hong Kong (Atkinson 107, Gomes 101) and their opponents could only manage 157/9 from their allotted overs. Finally, Harry made 162 and Maha 52 as Papua New Guinea (377/6) destroyed Israel (100); Amini took 5-19 for the Papuans.|$|E

500|$|The {{death toll}} <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>worse</b> {{had it not}} been for the {{self-sacrifice}} of an Intercolonial Railway dispatcher, Patrick Vincent (Vince) Coleman, operating at the railyard about [...] from Pier 6, where the explosion occurred. He and his co-worker, William Lovett, learned of the dangerous cargo aboard the burning Mont-Blanc from a sailor and began to flee. Coleman remembered, however, that an incoming passenger train from Saint John, New Brunswick, was due to arrive at the railyard within minutes. He returned to his post alone and continued to send out urgent telegraph messages to stop the train. Several variations of the message have been reported, among them this from the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic: [...] "Hold up the train. Ammunition ship afire in harbor making for Pier 6 and will explode. Guess this will be my last message. Good-bye boys." [...] Coleman's message was responsible for bringing all incoming trains around Halifax to a halt. It was heard by other stations all along the Intercolonial Railway, helping railway officials to respond immediately. Passenger Train No. 10, the overnight train from Saint John, is believed to have heeded the warning and stopped a safe distance from the blast at Rockingham, saving the lives of about 300 railway passengers. Coleman was killed at his post as the explosion ripped through the city. He was honoured with a Heritage Minute in the 1990s and inducted into the Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2004.|$|E
500|$|Flames {{could be}} seen as far away as Corvallis. One {{volunteer}} firefighter, Floyd McMullen, a student at Willamette University, died in the fire, which drew firefighters {{from as far away as}} Portland. Salem sent seven fire trucks to the scene; three more came from Portland. Only the outer walls were left standing after the fire was extinguished. Losses were estimated at $1.5 million ($ as of [...] ), and the state did not carry insurance. The losses, which included historic artifacts such as the portraits of all the governors, <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>worse</b> had the state not used fire-proof vaults in the basement to store valuables such as more than $1 million ($ as of [...] ) in stocks and bonds. During the blaze, firefighters poured water on these vaults to help keep them cool and prevent the contents from disintegrating. Years earlier, the state had turned over many historical documents to the Oregon Historical Society in Portland for preservation, and those records were preserved. Although the Supreme Court had moved to the Oregon Supreme Court Building in 1914, the two buildings were connected by underground tunnels used for electricity and heating. At the time of the fire, the Oregon State Library was in the basement and first floor of the Supreme Court Building. Many books in the basement suffered water damage when water used to fight the fire flooded underground tunnels and seeped into the Supreme Court Building. Offices previously housed in the capitol were moved to other government buildings and to leased space in downtown Salem until a new building was built.|$|E

[...] In the Cavalier breed, responsible breeders have used heart screening tests since 1995, but because many ignore veterinarian advice to only breed dogs over a certain age, {{there has been no}} health progress in that front.

2500|$|Alexander Grant in Independence and Nationhood (1984) found Robert III to be [...] "probably Scotland's least {{impressive}} king". Grant puts {{this into}} perspective and writes {{that it is}} notable that Robert III's reign <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>worse</b> compared to the turmoil and violence experienced in England and France when ruled by weak kings. Even on Robert's death, Scotland didn't descend into open civil war but was restricted to positioning among the royal family and its magnate groupings. Grant, in The New Cambridge Medieval History, explains that the 13th century Scottish kings ruled with the endorsement of practically all the political classes but {{that none of the}} 14th century kings, from Robert I to Robert III, did so and retained loyalty by the use of patronage. The benefits of this were outweighed by the disadvantages—alienated lands reduced crown income, endowments had the same effect, the estates granted to nobles and church often in regality led to a loss of royal attendance within these territories and contributed to a diminishment of authority.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first leg}} of the round of 16 was played in the Basel and Sevilla had not won a European away game all season, so the goalless draw in Switzerland {{represented}} an improvement. Three second-half saves from Basel goalkeeper Tomáš Vaclík kept the home team in contention, but reigning Europa League title holders Sevilla cannot be unhappy with a goalless draw in this first leg. Marc Janko jumped high to head Basel's first chance {{just a little bit}} wide as early as the seventh minute – easily Basel's best chance of the first half – with Sevilla dominating possession thereafter. Steven N'Zonzi went quite close with headers {{at either end of the}} period, while Éver Banega twice found Coke with free-kicks but the Sevilla captain was unable to find the target from either position. Basel's resolve returned after the half time break, if not their composure, Birkir Bjarnason blazing off target from a loose ball after a Renato Steffen shot was blocked. The Icelandic midfielder then pulled a decent ball across from the right, only for substitute Adama Traoré to scuff his attempted conversion. However, it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>worse</b> for the Swiss team but for Vaclík, who was very awake and saved with his feet after N'Zonzi was played in and then kept out Kévin Gameiro's low drive, going to ground once more to repel Yevhen Konoplyanka as time ticked down. [...] Midfielder N'Zonzi's dismissal near the end of the game offered Basel hope, but Sevilla held firm.|$|E

It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments, that no flagrant open crime <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>worse.</b> She had a great deal to listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae of distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been merely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence.

60|$|Nothing <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>worse</b> for the {{development}} of my mind than Dr. Butler's school, as it was strictly classical, nothing else being taught, except a little ancient geography and history. The school as a means of education to me was simply a blank. During my whole life I have been singularly incapable of mastering any language. Especial attention was paid to verse-making, and this I could never do well. I had many friends, and got together a good collection of old verses, which by patching together, sometimes aided by other boys, I could work into any subject. Much attention was paid to learning by heart the lessons of the previous day; this I could effect with great facility, learning forty or fifty lines of Virgil or Homer, whilst I was in morning chapel; but this exercise was utterly useless, for every verse was forgotten in forty-eight hours. I was not idle, and with the exception of versification, generally worked conscientiously at my classics, not using cribs. The sole pleasure I ever received from such studies, was from some of the odes of Horace, which I admired greatly.|$|E

I can say with a clear conscience, without any vainglory, that I had no fears for myself. The doing of my duty was the one thought in my mind. And here I may say once for all, my dear children, that I am speaking of myself all through this statement with the same freedom as though it were another man. In very truth the strong active lad of one-and-twenty was another man from the grey-headed old fellow who sits in the chimney corner and can do naught better than tell old tales to the youngsters. Shallow water gives a great splash, and so a braggart has ever been contemptible in my eyes. I trust, therefore, that ye will never think that your grandad is singing his own praises, or setting himself up as better than his neighbours. I do but lay the facts, as far as I can recall them, before ye with all freedom and with all truth.|$|E
60|$|The Domestic Manners of the Americans was {{the first}} of a series of books of travels, of which it was {{probably}} the best, and was certainly the best known. It will not be too much to say of it that it had a material effect upon the manners of the Americans of the day, and that that effect has been fully appreciated by them. No observer was certainly ever less qualified to judge of the prospects or even of the happiness of a young people. No one <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>worse</b> adapted by nature for the task of learning whether a nation was in a way to thrive. Whatever she saw she judged, as most women do, from her own standing-point. If a thing were ugly to her eyes, it ought to be ugly to all eyes,--and if ugly, it must be bad. What though people had plenty to eat and clothes to wear, if they put their feet upon the tables and did not reverence their betters? The Americans were to her rough, uncouth, and vulgar,--and she told them so. Those communistic and social ideas, which had been so pretty in a drawing-room, were scattered to the winds. Her volumes were very bitter; but they were very clever, and they saved the family from ruin.|$|E
60|$|For the {{examination}} school no preparation <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>worse.</b> It was {{no wonder that}} so uncalculating an adjustment of means and ends resulted in a second class (1836). The class was not merely a misfortune in itself, but threatened to be a bar to the fulfilment of his lifelong dream of a fellowship. He tried his fortunes at University, where he was beaten by Faber; and at Oriel, his own college, where he was beaten by the present Dean of St. Paul's. 'There was such a moral beauty about Church,' it was said by a man not peculiarly sensitive about moral beauty, 'that they could not help liking him.' Though Pattison had failed, Newman sent him word {{that there were some}} who thought that he had done the best. He made two more unsuccessful attempts, in one of them the triumphant competitor being Stanley, the famous Dean of a later day. At last, in November 1838, he was elected to a Yorkshire fellowship at Lincoln College. 'No moment in all my life,' he says, 'has ever been so sweet as that Friday morning, when Radford's servant came in to announce my election, and to claim his five shillings for doing so.' Yet if the curtain of fate could have been raised, his election to the Lincoln fellowship might have disclosed itself as the central misfortune of his life.|$|E
