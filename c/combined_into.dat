The Bath Foreign Hundred or Forinsecum covered the area {{outside the city}} and was later <b>combined</b> <b>into</b> the Bath Forum Hundred.

Around 1200 the first mayor was appointed.|$|E
5|$|Among major {{structural}} elements used in poetry are the line, the stanza or verse paragraph, and larger combinations of stanzas or lines such as cantos. Also sometimes used are broader visual presentations {{of words and}} calligraphy. These basic units of poetic form are often <b>combined</b> <b>into</b> larger structures, called poetic forms or poetic modes (see following section), as in the sonnet or haiku.|$|E
5|$|Immobile Holliday junctions, with {{asymmetrical}} sequences that {{lock the}} strands {{in a specific}} position, were artificially created by scientists to study their structure {{as a model for}} natural Holliday junctions. These junctions also later found use as basic structural building blocks in DNA nanotechnology, where multiple Holliday junctions can be <b>combined</b> <b>into</b> specific designed geometries that provide molecules {{with a high degree of}} structural rigidity.|$|E

Theoreticians describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers; for example, pins, forks, skewers, batteries, discovered attacks (especially discovered checks), zwischenzugs, deflections, decoys, sacrifices, underminings, overloadings, and interferences.|$|E

50|$|Physical {{quantities}} {{which remain}} separate in classical physics are naturally combined in SR and GR by enforcing the postulates of relativity. Most notably; {{space and time}} coordinates <b>combine</b> <b>into</b> the four-position, and energy and momentum <b>combine</b> <b>into</b> the four-momentum. The components of these four-vectors depend on the frame of reference used, and change under Lorentz transformations to other inertial frames or accelerated frames.|$|R
5|$|The 1972 {{hurricane}} season {{was the first}} year in which quasi-tropical cyclones were named, by using the NATO phonetic alphabet.

5|$|A {{battery of}} BM-13-16 {{launchers}} included four firing vehicles, two reload trucks and two technical support trucks, with each firing vehicle having {{a crew of}} six. Reloading was executed in 3–4 minutes, although the standard procedure was {{to switch to a}} new position some 10km away due to the ease with which the battery could be identified by the enemy. Three batteries were <b>combined</b> <b>into</b> a division (company), and three divisions into a separate mine-firing regiment of rocket artillery.|$|E

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was {{the biggest}} film shot in Hawaii since Waterworld, and was {{estimated}} to generate US$22 million to $45 million in the local economy. Because of an approaching hurricane, Spielberg was unable to shoot a fight at a waterfall, so he sent the second unit to film shots of Brazil's and Argentina's Iguazu Falls. These were digitally <b>combined</b> <b>into</b> the fight, which was shot at the Universal backlot.|$|E
5|$|As Jennings {{was also}} {{achieving}} success in country {{music in the}} early 1970s, the pair were <b>combined</b> <b>into</b> a genre called outlaw country, since it did not conform to Nashville standards. The album Wanted! The Outlaws in 1976 with Jessi Colter and Tompall Glaser cemented the pair's outlaw image and became country music's first platinum album. Later that year Nelson released The Sound in Your Mind (certified gold in 1978 and platinum in 2001) and his first gospel album Troublemaker (certified gold in 1986).|$|E
5|$|As the {{universe}} cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate {{that of the}} photon radiation. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei <b>combined</b> <b>into</b> atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation {{is known as the}} cosmic microwave background radiation. The chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when {{the universe}} was only 10–17 million years old.|$|E

5|$|Crewkerne Grammar School was {{situated}} at DeCombe House, until it {{closed in the}} late 1960s, before the Grammar school was <b>combined</b> <b>into</b> St Martins School of Abbey Street. St Martins used to be situated in the High Street, until it moved to its current position in the late 1970s. The Senior and Juniors School section closed in 2003, and now serves as a pre-school nursery only. The School Gymnasium was located along Gouldsbrook Terrace, and is still undergoing repairs {{to the floor and}} roof.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, {{people moved}} out of the {{surrounding}} Manhattan Valley neighborhood. Consequently, the Master Apartments' museum and cultural center closed by 1971, their holdings dispersed elsewhere, although the building's auditorium was still used for cultural events. After Louis's death in 1979, the building was bought by real estate investor Sol Goldman, who converted it to a housing co-operative over the next decade. Further renovations, which were completed in 2005, resulted in many of the one-bedroom studios being <b>combined</b> <b>into</b> two- and three-bedroom units. These renovations attracted more families and made the building more luxurious by both quality-of-life and purchase-price measures. The Master Apartments was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be <b>combined</b> <b>into</b> utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E
