40|$|Abstract: Nowdays, {{occupational}} and recreational activities in <b>cold</b> environments are common. Exposure to <b>cold</b> induces thermoregulatory responses like changes of behaviour and physiological adjustments to maintain thermal balance either by increasing metabolic heat production by shivering and/or by decreasing heat losses consecutive to peripheral cutaneous vasoconstriction. Those physiological responses present a great variability among individuals and depend mainly on biometrical characteristics, age, and general <b>cold</b> adaptation. During severe <b>cold</b> exposure, medical disorders may occur such as accidental hypothermia and/or freezing or non-freezing <b>cold</b> injuries. General <b>cold</b> adaptations have been qualitatively classified by Hammel and quantitatively by Savourey. This last classification {{takes into account}} the quantitative changes of the main <b>cold</b> reactions: higher or lower metabolic heat production, higher or lesser heat losses and finally the level of the core temperature observed {{at the end of a}} standardized exposure to <b>cold.</b> General <b>cold</b> adaptations observed previously in natives could also be developed in laboratory conditions by continuous or intermittent <b>cold</b> exposures. Beside general <b>cold</b> adaptation, local <b>cold</b> adaptation exists and is characterized by a lesser decrease of skin temperature, a more pronounced <b>cold</b> induced vasodilation, less pain and a higher manual dexterity. Adaptations to <b>cold</b> may reduce the occurrence of accidents and improve human performance as surviving in the <b>cold.</b> The present review describes both general and local <b>cold</b> adaptations in humans and how they are of interest for <b>cold</b> workers...|$|R

5|$|There {{are four}} main {{mechanisms}} for cooling {{the air to}} its dew point: adiabatic cooling, conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and evaporative cooling. Adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands. The air can rise due to convection, large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain (orographic lift). Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a <b>colder</b> surface, usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to <b>colder</b> land. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation, either by the air or by the surface underneath. Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture {{is added to the}} air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature, or until it reaches saturation.|$|E

It {{is not known}} whether intermittent <b>cold</b> exposure (<b>cold</b> training) is able to affect tissue responses to continuous <b>cold</b> exposure. Therefore, we investigated whether rat liver responses to continuous <b>cold</b> {{exposure of}} 2 days are modified by <b>cold</b> training (1 h daily for 5 days per week for 3 consecutive weeks). Continuous <b>cold</b> increased liver oxidative metabolism by increasing tissue content of mitochondrial proteins and mitochondrial aerobic capacity. <b>Cold</b> training did not affect such parameters, but attenuated or prevented the changes elicited by continuous <b>cold</b> exposure. Two-day <b>cold</b> exposure increased lipid hydroperoxide and protein-bound carbonyl levels in homogenates and mitochondria, whereas <b>cold</b> training decreased such effects although it decreased only homogenate protein damage in control rats. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes GPX and GR and H 2 O 2 production were increased by continuous <b>cold</b> exposure. Despite the increase in GPX and GR activities, livers from cold-exposed rats showed increased susceptibility to in vitro oxidative challenge. Such <b>cold</b> effects were decreased by <b>cold</b> training, which in control rats reduced only H 2 O 2 production and susceptibility to stress. The changes of PGC- 1, NRF- 1, and NRF- 2 expression levels were consistent with those induced by <b>cold</b> exposure and <b>cold</b> training in mitochondrial protein content and antioxidant enzyme activities.
