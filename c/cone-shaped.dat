5|$|The tower with a <b>cone-shaped</b> roof just to {{the right}} of the Greyfriars monastery was called Draktornet ("Dragon's Tower"), and in 1535 served as a prison.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{specimens}} have {{a moderately}} flared, posteriorly protruding outer lip, which is considerably thickened and completely devoid of marginal spikes or plicae. The body whorl is roundly swollen at the shoulder, {{with a few}} anterior spiral grooves. The shell has a medium-to-high <b>cone-shaped</b> spire, with at least five delicately furrowed whorls.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, most Russian churches from before the Petrine period had bulbous domes. The largest onion domes were erected in the seventeenth century in the area around Yaroslavl, {{incidentally}} famous for its large onions. Quite a few had more complicated bud-shaped domes, whose form derived from Baroque models of the late seventeenth century. Pear-shaped domes are usually associated with Ukrainian Baroque, while <b>cone-shaped</b> domes are typical for Orthodox churches of Transcaucasia.|$|E
5|$|Crickets {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with mostly cylindrical, somewhat vertically flattened bodies. The head is spherical with long slender antennae arising from <b>cone-shaped</b> scapes (first segments) and just behind {{these are two}} large compound eyes. On the forehead are three ocelli (simple eyes). The pronotum (first thoracic segment) is trapezoidal in shape, robust, and well-sclerotinized. It is smooth and has neither dorsal or lateral keels (ridges).|$|E
5|$|Like other theridiid spiders, the web is a disorganised, {{irregular}} {{tangle of}} fine textured silk. It is hammock-shaped and {{is made up}} of opaque yellowish-white silk. The web consists of a broad base with many supporting threads above and below, including a number of sticky guy lines anchored to debris in the sand. A <b>cone-shaped</b> retreat is built in {{the lower part of the}} web, although the katipo can normally be found near the main body of the web. The plants it builds its web in provide support and shelter for the nest.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart is}} <b>cone-shaped,</b> with its base {{positioned}} upwards and tapering {{down to the}} apex. An adult heart has a mass of 250–350 grams (9–12oz). The heart is typically {{the size of a}} fist: 12cm (5in) in length, 8cm (3.5in) wide, and 6cm (2.5in) in thickness. Well-trained athletes can have much larger hearts due to the effects of exercise on the heart muscle, similar to the response of skeletal muscle.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds have streamlined, {{spindle-shaped}} {{bodies with}} reduced or non-existent external ear flaps, rounded heads, flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, and small tails. Pinniped skulls have large eye orbits, short snouts and a constricted interorbital region. They are unique among carnivorans in that their orbital walls are significantly {{shaped by the}} maxilla and are not limited by certain facial bones. Compared to other carnivorans, their teeth tend to be fewer in number (especially incisors and back molars), are pointed and <b>cone-shaped,</b> and lack carnassials. The walrus has unique upper canines that are elongated into tusks. The mammary glands and genitals of pinnipeds can retract into the body.|$|E
5|$|Tamu Bintulu and Pasar Utama are the {{two main}} markets in the town. Both places have a unique <b>cone-shaped</b> roof that symbolises the {{traditional}} Melanau headgear named Terendak. Tamu Bintulu offers items ranging from jungle produce to native home-made specialties such as Belacan. Meanwhile, Pasar Utama houses both wet market and dry market under one roof, providing fresh vegetables, fruits, fish, and dairy products. The first floor of Pasar Utama {{offers a variety of}} fast food such as Laksa, Kolok Mee, Jawa Mee, Pulut Panggang, ais batu campur, cendol, and teh tarik. The Bintulu night market is located on Kampung Dagang road. There are over 150 stalls selling a variety of items such as garments, electric goods, vegetables, fruits, food and drinks.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetosphere}} of Jupiter {{is responsible}} for intense episodes of radio emission from the planet's polar regions. Volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io (see below) injects gas into Jupiter's magnetosphere, producing a torus of particles about the planet. As Io moves through this torus, the interaction generates Alfvén waves that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter. As a result, radio waves are generated through a cyclotron maser mechanism, and {{the energy is transmitted}} out along a <b>cone-shaped</b> surface. When Earth intersects this cone, the radio emissions from Jupiter can exceed the solar radio output.|$|E
5|$|After Bab el Wad, {{the road}} wound to Jerusalem through deep, narrow valleys, over steep spurs, {{and around the}} {{shoulders}} of rocky hills. There were other ways through the hills, but they were a tangle of unmapped, rough and rocky hill tracks and pathways—often little more than donkey tracks—which made movement by infantry, dismounted cavalry, and artillery very difficult. The rough tracks meandered through narrow valleys and over distorted piles of razor-backed ridges, which were broken by groups of <b>cone-shaped</b> hills and successive shelves of rock jutting out from every hillside at intervals of a few yards. It was virtually impossible for advances to the north or south of the main road to be supported by artillery. In heavy rain and cold, wet and muddy conditions, it {{was found to be}} impossible to deploy the 75th Division's guns off the road. These guns had been brought forward by teams of up to eight horses to a gun the day before.|$|E
5|$|Faget's {{preliminary}} Apollo design {{employed a}} <b>cone-shaped</b> command module, supported {{by one of}} several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power, sized appropriately for the space station, cislunar, and lunar landing missions. Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a Command/Service Module (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module. The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM, later shortened to Lunar Module, LM) which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.|$|E
5|$|With its {{flattened}} {{body and}} wing-like pectoral fins, the Pacific angelshark superficially resembles a ray. Unlike in rays, its five pairs of gill slits {{are located on}} the sides of the head rather than underneath, and the expanded anterior lobes of its pectoral fins are separate rather than fused to the head. The eyes are located on top of the head, with the spiracles behind. There are folds of skin without triangular lobes {{on the sides of}} head. The mouth is very wide and placed terminally (at the front of the snout); a pair of <b>cone-shaped</b> barbels with spoon-like tips are located above. There are 9 tooth rows on either side of the upper jaw and 10 tooth rows on either side of the lower jaw, with toothless gaps at the middle of both jaws. Each tooth has a broad base and a single narrow, smooth-edged cusp.|$|E
25|$|Imbros {{is mainly}} of {{volcanic}} origin {{and the highest}} mountain of the island İlyas Dağ, is an extinct <b>cone-shaped</b> stratovolcano.|$|E
25|$|There is a moraine at the {{confluence}} of Coles Creek with Fishing Creek. This causes there to be <b>cone-shaped</b> hills in the area.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cone-shaped</b> mask in {{particular}} is identified with the Ku Klux Klan in a self-conscious effort to combine the hiding of personal identity with the promotion of a powerful and intimidating image.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientist}} Robert Hooke {{presented a}} paper in 1694 to the Royal Society, in which he described a portable camera obscura. It was a <b>cone-shaped</b> box which fit onto the head and shoulders of its user.|$|E
25|$|Traffic cones, {{also called}} toddlers, road cones, safety cones, {{construction}} cones, pylons, or Witches' Hats, are usually <b>cone-shaped</b> markers that {{are placed on}} roads or sidewalks to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner. Traffic cones were invented in 1914 by Charles P. Rudabaker.|$|E
25|$|In 1915 Vasnetsov {{participated in}} the {{designing}} of a military uniform for the Victory parade of Russian army in Berlin and Constantinopole. Vasnetsov is credited {{with the creation of}} the budenovka (initially named bogatyrka), a military hat reproducing the style of ancient Rus' <b>cone-shaped</b> helmets.|$|E
25|$|Near Carmen, the Chocolate Hills {{are more}} than 1,200 uniformly <b>cone-shaped</b> {{limestone}} hills named for the grass growing on the hills that turns brown in the summer, making the landscape look like chocolate mounds. The Chocolate Hills appear on the provincial seal of Bohol.|$|E
25|$|Masks are use by penitents in ceremonies to {{disguise}} their identity {{in order to}} make the act of penitence more selfless. The Semana Santa parades throughout Spain and in Hispanic or Catholic countries throughout the world are examples of this, with their <b>cone-shaped</b> masks known as capirote.|$|E
25|$|Alkyne protons by {{contrast}} resonate at high field in a 2–3ppm range. For alkynes {{the most effective}} orientation is the external field in parallel with electrons circulation around the triple bond. In this way the acetylenic protons {{are located in the}} <b>cone-shaped</b> shielding zone hence the upfield shift.|$|E
25|$|Lunokhod 1 was a {{lunar vehicle}} formed of a tub-like {{compartment}} {{with a large}} convex lid on eight independently powered wheels. Its length was 2.3 metres. Lunokhod 1 was equipped with a <b>cone-shaped</b> antenna, a highly directional helical antenna, four television cameras, and special extendable devices to impact the lunar soil for density measurements and mechanical property tests.|$|E
25|$|The {{three-dimensional}} Froebel star is assembled {{from four}} identical paper strips with a width-to-length proportion of between 1:25 and 1:30. The weaving and folding procedure {{can be accomplished}} in about forty steps. The product is a paper star with eight flat prongs and eight <b>cone-shaped</b> tips. The assembly instructions can be aborted midway, producing a two-dimensional eight–pronged star without cones.|$|E
25|$|To {{withstand}} {{the heat of}} re-entry, the <b>cone-shaped</b> SRE-1 has a heat shield composed of silica tiles {{over much of the}} surface, and an ablative nose cap of carbon-phenolic composite. ISRO is also working on technology to manufacture carbon-carbon composite heat shields, which, along with the silica tiles tested with the SRE-1, could find use in future reusable spacecraft such as ISRO's planned Reusable Launch Vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Zoth-Ommog is {{the third}} son of Cthulhu. He has a <b>cone-shaped</b> body, a razor-fanged reptilian head, {{like that of a}} Tyrannosaurus rex, four broad, flat, starfish-like arms with suckers, and a mane of tentacles. How he swims or walks on the ocean floor is unknown, but it is {{possible}} that he has a slug-like foot {{similar to that of the}} Great Race of Yith.|$|E
25|$|Hindwing: the discal {{band of the}} forewing {{continued}} as a subbasal transverse white band: a postdiscal, narrower, more or less macular band also white, and a very distinct pale, still narrower, subterminal band. The interspace between the postdiscal and the subterminal bands darker than the general ground colour of the wing, and the postdiscal band {{on the inner side}} margined with similarly coloured <b>cone-shaped</b> marks.|$|E
25|$|After the {{formation}} of the caldera, eruptions were localized to its edge and formed more than ten of small craters, mostly on the northern edge. The products were dominated by viscous trachyte and rhyolite lavas. Pyroclastic flow deposits were accumulating {{on the bottom of the}} caldera, forming ignimbrites and obsidian, and sometimes slag pumice. A <b>cone-shaped</b> crater Göltepe (height 2,485 m above sea level) formed at the bottom of the caldera, on the fault line.|$|E
25|$|Nine of the {{fourteen}} Martello towers built in Canada still survive. (In addition, the existing fortifications at Fort Henry received two thin towers between 1845 and 1848. However, these are dry ditch defence towers, rather than true Martello towers.) A common characteristic of Canadian Martello towers was removable <b>cone-shaped</b> roofs {{to protect against}} snow. Today, many of the restored towers have permanent roof additions – for ease of upkeep, not historical accuracy.|$|E
25|$|On the Adda Seal, Enki is {{depicted}} with two streams of water flowing {{into each of}} his shoulders: one the Tigris, the other the Euphrates. Alongside him are two trees, symbolizing {{the male and female}} aspects of nature. He is shown wearing a flounced skirt and a <b>cone-shaped</b> hat. An eagle descends from above to land upon his outstretched right arm. This portrayal reflects Enki's role as the god of water, life, and replenishment.|$|E
25|$|A spherical {{secondary}} {{can achieve}} higher implosion densities than a cylindrical secondary, because spherical implosion pushes {{in from all}} directions toward the same spot. However, in warheads yielding more than one megaton, the diameter of a spherical secondary would be too large for most applications. A cylindrical secondary is necessary in such cases. The small, <b>cone-shaped</b> re-entry vehicles in multiple-warhead ballistic missiles after 1970 tended to have warheads with spherical secondaries, and yields {{of a few hundred}} kilotons.|$|E
25|$|Mule {{spindles}} rest on {{a carriage}} that travels on a track a distance of , while drawing out and spinning the yarn. On the return trip, known as putting up, as the carriage moves back to its original position, the newly spun yarn is wound onto the spindle {{in the form of}} a <b>cone-shaped</b> cop. As the mule spindle travels on its carriage, the roving which it spins is fed to it through rollers geared to revolve at different speeds to draw out the yarn.|$|E
25|$|Female: Hindwing: {{the black}} on the costal margin as in cerberus, {{but there is}} always a large yellow spot at base of {{interspace}} 7; interspace 1 black, with a pale patch in the middle; the black terminal border broader, the inwardly extended <b>cone-shaped</b> markings prominent, those in interspaces 2 and 3 with pale buff lateral edgings, extended inwards to the postdiscal spots. In both male and female the hindwing on the upperside is clothed with soft, silky, long brownish-black hairs from base along the dorsal area.|$|E
25|$|The task of {{dividing}} plots {{perpendicular to}} the coast was made much easier {{by the fact that}} numerous ravines, difficult to cross, cover Réunion, starting from the heights and striating the sides of this <b>cone-shaped</b> island. Each lot might therefore be bounded by two torrents, as is the concession stretching from the shore to the mountain peaks that Governor Jacques de La Cour granted to Chauveau et Grimaud on 10 February 1699 between Ravine Saint-Gilles and Ravine des Sables. The downhill flow of the water forms nearly incontestable natural bounds for the property.|$|E
25|$|On 27 January 2014, Ukrainian police {{reported}} a 55-year-old man from Western Ukraine found dead {{hanging from the}} framework of a huge artificial 'New Year tree' in central Kiev. The body was found hanging inside the <b>cone-shaped</b> tubular steel construction on Kiev's Independence Square. The tree, which had become a symbol of anti-government resistance, was at that time decorated with a poster of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko and scrawled with graffiti opposing President Viktor Yanukovich. The square had been covered in protesters all day and night since 1 December 2013.|$|E
25|$|Male: Hindwing: {{the black}} along the dorsal and {{terminal}} margins both on upper and undersides much broader; on the upperside entirely filling interspace 1, {{on the underside}} with only a narrow streak of yellow at the angle between the median vein and vein 2; the <b>cone-shaped</b> black markings on the terminal margin shorter and broader; on the costal margin the black is narrower than in cerberus, barely extended below vein 8 except at the base and apex of the wing where it broadens; the abdomen is dull yellow above and below not shaded with black.|$|E
25|$|Skirts {{were held}} in the proper shape by a farthingale or hoop skirt. In Spain, the <b>cone-shaped</b> Spanish farthingale {{remained}} in fashion into the early 17th century. It was only briefly fashionable in France, where a padded roll or French farthingale (called in England a bum roll) held the skirts out in a rounded shape at the waist, falling in soft folds to the floor. In England, the Spanish farthingale was worn through the 1570s, and was gradually replaced by the French farthingale. By the 1590s, skirts were pinned to wide wheel farthingales to achieve a drum shape.|$|E
