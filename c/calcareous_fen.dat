40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 <b>Calcareous</b> <b>fens</b> {{are rare}} within southeastern Alaska {{due to their}} unique geochemical setting, as are the plant {{communities}} produced by these environs.

Multivariate analyses were used to describe these wetland systems. The second objective of this study included investigating whether or not the disjunct Betula glandulosa (dwarf birch) population was restricted to its current site. B. glandulosa is a habitat generalist in its known range; however, it is found in only one location within the Alexander Archipelago. Germination and seedling transplant experiments were conducted that tested for the effects of site, competition, and the interaction between site and competition.

50|$|Cypripedium reginae {{grows in}} {{wetlands}} such as fens and open wooded swamps that are sometimes populated by tamarack and black spruce.7 Cyp. reginae thrives in neutral to basic soils {{but can be}} found in slightly acidic conditions. The plants often form in clumps by branching of the underground rhizomes. Its roots are typically within a few inches of the top of the soil. It prefers very loose soils and when growing in fens it will most often be found in mossy hummocks. This photo, taken in a forested, <b>calcareous</b> <b>fen</b> in Williamstown, MA, is only one of 14 occurrences currently documented in the state (1984 to the present 2016). The increasing rarity of this plant is attributable to destruction of a suitable alkaline habitat - and an exploding deer population whose browsing stunts or eliminates its growth.It can tolerate full sun but prefers partial shade for some part of the day. When exposed to full sun, the flower lip is somewhat bleached and less deeply colored. It is occasionally eaten by white-tailed deer.8 Cypripedium reginae {{can be found in}} Canada from Saskatchewan east to Atlantic Canada, and the eastern United States south to Arkansas and Tennessee.|$|E
40|$|The minute snail Pupilla alpicola (Stylommatophora: Pupillidae) {{is known}} as a {{threatened}} glacial relict restricted to treeless <b>calcareous</b> <b>fens</b> with Holocene continuity, mainly in the Alpine and Carpathian regions. We summarize all available data on the distribution of P. alpicola and analyse its ecological requirements in the Western Carpathians both at a larger, regional scale (162 sites) and at a smaller, within-site scale (10 sites). Viable populations of Pupilla alpicola occurred in 31 sites out of the 162 fens studied. Water conductivity, Ellenberg’s indicator values for soil reaction, light and nutrients were the main ecological variables that explained these occurrences. The species preferred sites with extremely high calcium carbonate precipitation, low nutrients and sparse herb vegetation cover. Its present distribution in the Western Carpathians is strongly related to a spatial–temporal continuum of <b>calcareous</b> <b>fens</b> throughout the Holocene; none of the modern populations was located further than 40 km from the known palaeorefugium.

40|$|Calcareous fens {{constitute}} a specific habitat which is uncommon in Europe and {{protected by the}} EU habitat directive due to its importance to several threatened species. Hagebyhöga in Östergötland is a <b>calcareous</b> <b>fen</b> habitat included in the Natura 2000 Networking Programme. Adjacent to the existing fen, a degraded fen area is situated. The area {{has been used for}} agriculture for several years but is now going to be restored to its former state by the county administrative board of Östergötland. When working with restoration of degraded fen areas it is important to aquire knowledge about the chemical soil conditions. Plant growth limited by phosphorus and low fertility are characteristic conditions for calcareous fens, whilst arable land usually is highly fertile and limited by nitrogen. The {{purpose of this study is}} to bring forth useful knowledge for restoring the degraded <b>calcareous</b> <b>fen</b> of Hagebyhöga. Phytometric assessments have been conducted on samples from the ground that is going to be restored, to investigate which element limits growth, and whether the fertility is comparable to that in the fen allready present. The results will be used when deciding whether the top soil layer needs to be removed, and if that is the case, how much of the soil needs to be removed to recreate the fen environment. The samples were collected from two areas (A and B) with different moisture content in the arable ground and three depths from each area (0 - 10 cm, 10 - 30 cm and 30 - 40 cm). As reference, a sample from the top soil layer of the existing fen was used. The results from the phytometric assessment reveals all samples from area A and the sample from area B, 30 - 40 cm to have plant growth limited by phosphorus. The results also reveals the fertility in all samples except for area A, 30 - 40 cm to be significantly higher than the fertility of the existing fen.

40|$|International audienceAlthough high {{mountain}} areas {{have traditionally been}} viewed as predominantly grazing areas, with low population and {{a high degree of}} land-use stasis, recent research suggest that land-use complexity and change over time has been underestimated. This interdisciplinary palaeoenvironmental analysis has been carried out on the Pradell <b>calcareous</b> <b>fen,</b> located in the eastern Pre-Pyrenees (Spain) at 1975 m a. s. l., and it comprises different environmental indicators: pollen, stomata, non-pollen palynomorphs, macrocharcoal particles, lithostratigraphy, sedimentology and geochemistry. The results of this high temporal resolution study are integrated with archaeological data, and together provide strong evidence for the complexity of the high-mountain land-use system over the last 1500 years. Archaeological fieldwork has shown the rise of highland mining activities during the Roman period. Later, frequent fires resulted from the farming and settlement that followed the Christian conquest. Geochemical analysis of sediment cores records late-Mediaeval metal production, while the expansion of feudal cropping and the advent of several Mediaeval crises are clearly recorded in both the pollen and the historical data. Finally, the rise of a mixed economy system based on transhumance, farming, metallurgy and woodland exploitation was established during Modern and Contemporary times. The high correlation between the palaeoenvironmental, archaeological and historical data at the Pradell fen stresses the value of calcareous fens for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of historical landscapes. Results obtained also depict {{high mountain}} landscapes {{as the result of the}} long-term interaction of many human practices, including mining and smelting, grazing, cropping and tree exploitation for the production of wood, charcoal and resin...|$|E

40|$|Calcareous fens are {{considered}} to be among the most threatened ecosystems of Europe. They are {{also one of the most}} diverse habitats as they support an incredibly rich and diverse range of plant and animal species. However, in spite of their diversity, calcareous fens are still poorly investigated, especially when referring to fen invertebrates, such as spiders. Because spiders are good bioindicators, knowledge of their ecology in rare and threatened habitats is of interest. The aim of this study was to document the composition and diversity of spider species, families and foraging guilds in the ground– and grass–layers of the Apšuciems <b>calcareous</b> <b>fen,</b> and to evaluate the influence of vegetation structure on spider community organization. In summer 2012, we collected ground–dwelling spiders using pitfall traps and grass–dwelling spiders using sweep–netting. A total of 2, 937 spider individuals belonging to 19 families and 80 species was collected in the Apšuciems fen. Our results indicate that spider species and families tend to be stratified across the vertical structure of the habitat; the spider composition in the ground stratum differed from that in the grass stratum. On the contrary, however, the spider foraging guild structure between the ground–layer and the grass–layer was similar. Each of the two studied strata presented similar guilds in similar proportions. Our results also showed that spider composition differed considerably between fen parts and that much of this variability could be explained by the architectural properties of the habitat.

40|$|The {{distribution}} and occurrence of plant species {{within a given}} region provides insight into the many environmental properties of that region. Although much {{research has been conducted}} on plant communities and associated environmental properties, few studies have been conducted on the characteristics of individual plants within those communities. Calcareous fens are wetlands formed by the upwelling of mineral-rich groundwater and often are associated with many unique plant communities and rare species of flora and fauna. Although many studies have documented the vegetation patterns and associated environmental gradients of these fens, none have isolated the specific hydrogeochemical conditions associated with individual species, nor have any studies attempted to document and compare the individual physiological response of species to elevated environmental calcium levels. This research was conducted to estimate environmental calcium requirements for rare as well as common indicator species of calcareous fens of Massachusetts and {{to examine the relationship between}} the accumulation of calcium in the tissues of these species to calcium availability in their environment. These factors will be important when determining required conditions for fen restoration and will further the understanding of why these species often only occur in calcareous fens. Eight <b>calcareous</b> <b>fen</b> study sites at three different locations were established where calciphiles occur in western Massachusetts. In each site, data were collected on the vegetation patterns and associated soil chemistry, water chemistry, and hydrology. In addition, plant tissues were collected and analyzed for calcium. Species distributions were evaluated as to whether they increased in abundance as environmental calcium did or whether they appeared to occur only once a specific calcium threshold was met. In addition, the concentrations of calcium in the tissues were used to determine the extent to which those plants accumulated calcium and how those levels related to levels of calcium in the substrate environment and to their overall distributions. It was found that certain calciphiles are calcium specialists, i. e. they are more abundant when environmental calcium levels are elevated, absorb greater quantities of calcium and those quantities correlate to the available environmental supply. These species include Parnassia glauca, Packera aurea, Geum rivale and Carex granularis. Of these, Geum rivale and Carex granularis, as well as Carex sterilis, did not occur below calcium concentrations of 48 mg. L- 1. However, other calciphiles are calcium generalists, i. e. they are tolerant of elevated calcium levels but show no other relationship with respect to growth or accumulation. These species include Carex flava, Carex hystericina, Juncus nodosus, Solidago patula, Solidago uliginosa, and Symphyotrichum puniceum. In addition, some wetland generalists maintain elevated calcium levels (Symplocarpus foetidus and Mentha arvensis) whereas most others do not (Thelypteris palustris and Fragaria vesca). Of the calciphile and wetland generalist species, some appear to increase in abundance in calcareous fens in relation to increases in accessory benefits (Dasiphora fruticosa and Juncus brachycephalus with pH; Thelypteris palustris and Carex flava with magnesium and possibly Equisetum fluviatile with iron). Combined, these findings characterize the growth habits and calcium accumulation of species that grow in calcareous fens and indicate that calciphiles have varying degrees of dependence on calcium...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Phytosociological {{classification}} of fen vegetation (Scheuchzerio palustris-Caricetea fuscae class) differs among European countries. Here we propose a unified vegetation {{classification of}} European fens at the alliance level, provide unequivocal assignment rules for individual vegetation plots, identify diagnostic species of fen alliances, and map their distribution. Location: Europe, western Siberia and SE Greenland. Methods: 29 049 vegetation-plot records of fens {{were selected from}} databases using a list of specialist fen species. Formal definitions of alliances were created using the presence, absence and abundance of Cocktail-based species groups and indicator species. DCA visualized the similarities among the alliances in an ordination space. The ISOPAM classification algorithm was applied to regional subsets with homogeneous plot size to check whether the classification based on formal definitions matches the results of unsupervised classifications. Results: The following alliances were defined: Caricion viridulo-trinervis (sub-halophytic Atlantic dune-slack fens), Caricion davallianae (temperate <b>calcareous</b> <b>fens),</b> Caricion atrofusco-saxatilis (arcto-alpine <b>calcareous</b> <b>fens),</b> Stygio-Caricion limosae (boreal topogenic brown-moss fens), Sphagno warnstorfii-Tomentypnion nitentis (Sphagnum-brown-moss rich fens), Saxifrago-Tomentypnion (continental to boreo-continental nitrogen-limited brown-moss rich fens), Narthecion scardici (alpine fens with Balkan endemics), Caricion stantis (arctic brown-moss rich fens), Anagallido tenellae-Juncion bulbosi (Ibero-Atlantic moderately rich fens), Drepanocladion exannulati (arcto-boreal-alpine non-calcareous fens), Caricion fuscae (temperate moderately rich fens), Sphagno-Caricion canescentis (poor fens) and Scheuchzerion palustris (dystrophic hollows). The main variation in the species composition of European fens reflected site chemistry (pH, mineral richness) and sorted the plots from calcareous and extremely rich fens, through rich and moderately rich fens, to poor fens and dystrophic hollows. ISOPAM classified regional subsets according to this gradient, supporting the ecological meaningfulness of this classification concept on both the regional and continental scale.

Bog turtle habitats are usually well-drained with very shallow surface waters (PNHP 2007). The species requires open areas for basking and nesting surrounded by early successional wetland vegetation.

Decline is primarily due to loss, degradation, and fragmentation of habitat and excessive (and illegal) collecting for the pet trade (Ernst et al. 1994). Bog turtle populations may suffer from low new recruitment due to predation by raccoon and trampling by humans walking through the habitat.
