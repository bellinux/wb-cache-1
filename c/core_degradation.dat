As a consequence, there is uncertainty in the capability of codes to predict <b>core</b> <b>degradation</b> in postulated severe accident transients of nuclear power plants. The GAMA has launched an action {{in order to determine}} the ability of current advanced codes to predict <b>core</b> <b>degradation</b> in nuclear reactors. The TMI- 2 scenario was selected as the case to analyze since it concerns the only full scale Pressurized Water Reactor to have experienced <b>core</b> <b>degradation.</b> Data from the code calculations were compared to the TMI- 2 end-state to determine the codes‟ predictive capability. The study was completed in 2004, and is documented in ref. 2. One conclusion of the study is that variability in the codes predictions existed in part because initial conditions of the tMI- 2 scenario were not well defined. It was concluded that code variability could be better evaluated if these conditions were better defined. Therefore, an additional task was proposed to benchmark the codes. This phase II study evaluates the variability in the codes‟ results using a postulated <b>core</b> <b>degradation</b> scenario of the TMI- 2 reactor. The scenario was specified with simple initial and boundary conditions so that the influence of uncertainty of these conditions was minimized and the variability in the codes‟ results is more readily determine...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the Oxidation Phenomena in Severe Accidents (OPSA) project is to increase understanding of <b>core</b> <b>degradation</b> resulting from air ingress, the main concern being possible increased fission product release in reactor transients. Experiments in which oxidised fuel rods were exposed to air at high temperatures were successfully performed in the out-of-pile DRESSMAN single-rod and CODEX bundle facilities. These were supported by scaling studies which helped to define the test conditions with reference to possible plant conditions, and by detailed pre-test and post-test calculations with versions of the ICARE 2 <b>core</b> <b>degradation</b> code modified for air ingress. The DRESSMAN tests showed a protective effect of oxide layers formed in steam before air ingress, with some increase indicated in the reaction heat after air ingress. The CODEX tests indicated acceleration of oxidation and <b>core</b> <b>degradation</b> phenomena following air ingress. with the extent of fuel rod/spacer grid degradation and of zirconium nitride formation depending on the transient conditions.

40|$|To prevent HPME and DCH, SADV is {{proposed}} {{to be added}} to the pressurizer for Chinese improved 1000 [*]MWe PWR NPP with the reference of EPR design. Rapid depressurization capability is assessed using the mechanical analytical code. Three typical severe accident sequences of TMLB’, SBLOCA, and LOFW are selected. It shows that with activation of the SADV the RCS pressure is low enough to prevent HPME and DCH. Natural circulation at upper RPV and hot leg is considered for the rapid depressurization capacity analysis. The result shows that natural circulation phenomenon results in heat transfer from the core to the pipes in RCS which may cause the creep rupture of pipes in RCS and delays the severe accident progression. Different SADV valve areas are investigated to the influence of depressurization of RCS. Analysis shows that the introduction of SADV with right valve area will delay progression of <b>core</b> <b>degradation</b> to RPV failure.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the main uncertain <b>core</b> <b>degradation</b> parameters impact on {{the consequences of a}} severe accident has been performed. This investigation has been performed to assess severe accident codes weaknesses and to identify the potential needs of separate effect tests to reduce uncertainties regarding the more sensitive <b>core</b> <b>degradation</b> parameters. On this purpose, a sensitivity study of the hydrogen production (total amount and flow rate), of fission product (FP) release and of the corium composition, to some degradation modelling uncertainties, has been realised with ICARE 2 and ASTEC codes, taking into account a particular accidental sequence (loss of feed water) for a French 900 MWe pressurized water reactor. The results of this study indicate that, depending on the different set of parameters retained in the modelling, the mass of hydrogen produced can range from 320 to 580 kg, whereas the flow rate can vary between 0, 1 to 0, 4 kg. s- 1. Moreover, the FP release increases significantly when the amount of dissolved fuel increases.

40|$|The Fukushima {{accident}} {{emphasized the}} fact that ways to monitor in real time {{the evolution of a}} nuclear reactor during a severe accident remain to be developed. No fission products were monitored during twelve days; only dose rates were measured, which is not sufficient to carry out an online diagnosis of the event. The first measurements were announced with little reliability for low volatile fission products. In order to improve the safety of nuclear plants and minimize the industrial, ecological and health consequences of a severe accident, it is necessary to develop new reliable measurement systems, operating at the earliest and closest to the emission source of fission products. Through the French program ANR « Projet d’Investissement d’Avenir », the aim of the DECA-PF project (diagnosis of <b>core</b> <b>degradation</b> from fission products measurements) is to monitor in real time the release of the major fission products (krypton, xenon, gaseous forms of iodine and ruthenium) outside the nuclear reactor containment.

However, the mechanisms that distinguish RNAs and mediate their functions are poorly understood.

40|$|During a steam {{generator}} tube rupture (SGTR) accident, direct release of radioactive nuclides {{into the environment}} is postulated via bypassing the containment building. This conveys a significant threat in severe accident management (SAM) for minimization of radionuclide release. To mitigate this risk, a numerical assessment of SAM strategies was performed for an SGTR accident of an Optimized Power Reactor 1000 MWe (OPR 1000) using MELCOR code. Three in-vessel mitigation strategies were evaluated {{and the effect of}} delayed operation action was analyzed. The MELCOR calculations showed that activation of a prompt secondary feed and bleed (F&B) operation using auxiliary feed water and use of an atmospheric dump valve could prevent <b>core</b> <b>degradation.</b> However, depressurization using the safety depressurization system could not prevent <b>core</b> <b>degradation,</b> and the injection of coolant via high-pressure safety injection without the use of reactor coolant system (RCS) depressurization increased fission product release. When mitigation action was delayed by 30 minutes after SAMG entrance, a secondary F&B operation failed in depressurizing the RCS sufficiently, and a significant amount of fission products were released into the environment. These results suggest that appropriate mitigation actions should be applied in a timely manner to achieve the optimal mitigation effects.

The goal is to characterize the corium and debris flows from the core to accurately evaluate the corium pool propagation transient in the lower head and so the associated risk of vessel failure. In the case of LWR with heavy reflector, to evaluate the corium relocation into the lower head, we have to study the risk associated with focusing effect and the possibility to stabilize laterally the corium in core with a flooded down-comer. It is necessary to characterize the <b>core</b> <b>degradation</b> and the stratification of the corium pool that is formed in core. We assume that the <b>core</b> <b>degradation</b> until the corium pool formation and the corium pool propagation could be modeled separately.

Geometrical shapes and 0 D models are associated with the corium pool and the other components of the degraded core (debris, heavy reflector, core plate…). During the transient, these shapes evolve taking into account the thermal and stratification behavior of the corium pool and the melting of the core surrounding components.
