40|$|Background: Migration is a {{risk factor}} for {{psychosis}} in international migrants. Objectives: We compared the psychiatric morbidity in first and <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> interstate migrants in India. Methods: Psychiatric morbidity was assessed in 18 - 64 -year-old first and <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> migrants of both the gender using Mini International Neuropsychiatry Interview. Total 70 subjects were included in the study. Males and females of both the generation compared. Results: Mood disorders are found to be most common disorder in <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> migrants. Where females of <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> migrants have a major depressive episode with melancholic features, as compared to males who have manic episode significantly higher in <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> migrants. Conclusion: Migration {{is a risk}} factor for mood disorders especially in <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> migrants. As adversity of migration, discrimination, and acculturation faced from birth and early life leads to higher rates of psychiatry morbidity in <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> migrants...|$|R
30|$|First {{generation}} {{immigrants are}} defined as people not born in Germany. Those who are born in Germany but (a) do not hold German citizenship, or (b) {{have at least one}} parent who is not German-born or of non-German nationality are called <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> immigrants. Both first and <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> immigrants are considered in this analysis, assuming that members of the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> are not fully assimilated and still differ in their behavior, at least partly, from natives. Marriage between first and <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> immigrants is therefore treated as immigrant marriage, while marriages between natives and <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> immigrants are considered intermarriages.|$|R

50|$|By {{computing}} the intergenerational {{correlation between}} relative wages of first and <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> {{workers from the}} same country a conclusion was made regarding whether or not first generation immigrants influence the wages of the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> immigrants.

The study found that both immigrants and natives pass along {{almost exactly the same}} level of economic advantages or disadvantages to their offspring. These conclusions predict diminishing correlations in wages from the first and <b>second</b> <b>generations</b> if change in the level of education for each immigrant is considered. Since the majority of immigrants have low levels of education, it may be increasingly difficult for future <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> immigrants to ever surpass the average wages of non-immigrants.|$|R

40|$|Why did <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> Jews, {{faced with}} rapid upward {{mobility}} and marginality choose to remain identified as Jews and what conditions and adaptations {{allowed them to}} do so? The <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> immigrant to America, that is, the first native-born generation of immigrant parentage, finds itself in the ambiguous position of exposure to two cultures both of which exert pressure for membership and conformity – the immigrant culture of their parents and what they perceive to be the dominant culture of American society. This marginal position between cultures and the resulting stress demand some form of resolution. This thesis examines the resolutions of the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> of Jews from Eastern Europe.

40|$|Following work by Wünsch and collaborators, we {{investigate}} a self-enrichment scenario for <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> star formation in globular clusters wherein wind material from first generation massive stars rapidly radiatively cools. Radiative energy loss allows retention of fast winds within the central regions of clusters, where it fuels star formation. Secondary star formation occurs in ∼ 3 - 5 Myr, before supernovae, producing uniform iron abundances in both populations. We derive the critical criteria for radiative cooling of massive star winds and the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> mass {{as a function}} of cluster mass, radius, and metallicity. We derive a critical condition on M/R, above which <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> star formation can occur. We speculate that above this threshold the strong decrease in the cluster wind energy and momentum allows ambient gas to remain from the cluster formation process. We reproduce large observed <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> fractions of ∼ 30 - 80 % if wind material mixes with ambient gas. Importantly, the mass of ambient gas required is only of order the first generation's stellar mass. <b>Second</b> <b>generation</b> helium enrichment Δ Y is inversely proportional to mass fraction in the second generation; a large <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> can form with Δ Y∼ 0. 001 - 0. 02, while a small <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> can reach Δ Y∼ 0. 16. Like other self-enrichment models for the <b>second</b> <b>generation,</b> we are not able to simultaneously account for both the full range of the Na-O anticorrelation and the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> fraction.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the impact of the social {{characteristics}} of the host society on the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> Iranians’ understanding of their national and ethnic identities. In this regard I have studied how the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> Iranians in Sweden identify themselves with Iranian society, with the Iranian ethnic group in Sweden and/or with Swedish society and then compared the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> Iranians in Sweden and those in the Unites States to try to make clear the impact of the host society on the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> Iranians’ understanding of their ethnic and national identities. Educational attainment is regarded as a cornerstone in the identity construction of <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> Iranians (Hartman, 2009; Bozorgmehr and Douglas, 2010; Shavarini, 2004). The literatures, which is based mainly on the studies conducted in the Unites States among <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> Iranians, indicates several factors being important for such an attainment. I have examined whether these factors also are important for the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> Iranians in Sweden; this in order to more concretely show the impact of the social characteristics of the host society on the <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> Iranians' understanding of their identities. For gathering the data in Sweden I used semi-structured e-mail interviews with fifteen young people of Iranian background (defined as individuals with both parents born in Iran). When comparing my study with those in the United States, I could not find the identity tensions and identity crisis reported by the research on <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> Iranians in the United States among the same generation in Sweden.
