40|$|ABSTRACT Tremendous genetic {{progress}} has been observed historically for growth and feed conversion {{through the efforts of}} the primary breeding companies. However, significant between-strain variation still exists due to differences in selection emphasis and selection techniques practiced by these organizations. This paper provides an overview of methods currently employed in <b>commercial</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>breeding</b> with reference to factors complicating program design and future challenges facing the industry. Mass selection for body weight has resulted in a significant {{reduction in the number of}} days required to grow bird to market weight with indirect improvements in feed conversion.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of Salmonella in a samples of 40 imported day-old duckling flocks was assessed from 1998 to 2003 {{according to the}} guidelines of the Brazilian National Poultry Health Program (Programa Nacional de Sanidade Avícola-PNSA). The pathogen was recovered from 26 flocks (65. 0 %). The most common serovars were S. Saintpaul and S. Kottbus. Up to four serovars were isolated from a single flock. Transportation box swabs (82. 6 %) and yolk sac pool (47. 1 %) showed the highest and the lowest frequency of Salmonella isolation, respectively. The high percentage of Salmonella isolation from imported day-old ducklings causes concern because of the zoonotic potential of this agent and its economical importance to <b>commercial</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>breeding...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation was to characterize infectious bursal disease viruses (IBDV) circulating in <b>commercial</b> and <b>breeding</b> <b>poultry</b> farms in Ethiopia between 2009 and 2011. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence for VP 2 hypervariable region of ten IBDVs were determined by RT-PCR, sequenced and compared to well characterised IBDV isolates worldwide. IBDV genetic material was amplified directly from bursa or cell passaged material. Phylogenetically, Ethiopian IBDVs represented two genetic lineages: very virulent (vv) IBDVs or variants of the classical attenuated vaccine strain (D 78). The nucleotide identity between Ethiopian vvIBDVs ranged between 0 % to 2. 6 %. Ethiopian vvIBDVs are clustered phylogenetically with the African IBDV genetic lineage, independent of the Asian/European lineage. This report demonstrates the circulation of vvIBDV in <b>commercial</b> and <b>breeding</b> <b>poultry</b> farms in Ethiopia.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the regional differences of large scale livestock and <b>poultry</b> <b>breeding</b> in China, the standardized pig index from province-level data of Chinese animal industry yearbooks during 2002 - 2009 was used in present study.

The {{results showed that the}} large scale livestock and <b>poultry</b> <b>breeding</b> ascended during 2002 - 2009 in general, and the rising trend became more and more significant year by year.

Period from 2007 to 2009 was the rapid ascending period, and the overall regional differences ascended rapidly. During the whole period, the internal region difference was more significant than that of interval region. Meanwhile, based on the regional difference study, the development of large scale livestock and <b>poultry</b> <b>breeding</b> in China and the analysis of contribution rate of differences inside this region, the present research suggests that local governments in the six regions should take different policies for management of the livestock and <b>poultry</b> <b>breeding</b> industry...|$|R

40|$|The global poultry {{sector is}} divided into a {{large-scale}} commercial sector dominated by international, highly vertically integrated companies, and a small-scale sector that provides up to 90 percent of total poultry production {{in some of the}} least developed countries. The fast reproduction cycle, low unit costs, economies of scale in research and appropriation and control of the produce are driving factors in the commercial sector. Private research concentrates on technologies that are likely to result in market applications and returns to investment. Private incentives for animal research are strongest where markets for improved technology are large, technical advances can be made quickly, and intellectual property can be protected. To-date, technological protection strategies and contractual practices, rather than formal intellectual property rights strategies, have dominated in the <b>commercial</b> <b>poultry</b> sector. Poultry breeders have developed a highly successful way of protecting their intellectual property investment in superior breeds by exploiting heterosis, and the deleterious segregation of hybrid stocks in the next generation. Thus, by restricting access to the pure parent line stock (a form of trade secret) and selling F 1 generation birds, a breeder remains the sole supplier of useful material.

40|$|Small-scale <b>commercial</b> <b>poultry</b> {{enterprises}} {{are often}} promoted {{and used by}} the government and non-governmental organisations in development projects to generate income and to improve food self-sufficiency and alleviate malnutrition, as poultry is an excellent source of protein.

The results of a block-recursive regression analysis of data gathered from a sample of 123 poultry farmers in the province indicate that enterprise growth rate is constrained by poor access to credit, high transaction costs and unreliable local markets. Government policies should focus on reducing transaction costs by improving education and physical infrastructure, sponsoring training and mentoring services for small-scale <b>commercial</b> <b>poultry</b> producers, and helping these emerging entrepreneurs to formalise the business institutions needed to manage co-owned resources and to market products collectively. ...|$|R
