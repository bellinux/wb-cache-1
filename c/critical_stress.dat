40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{resistance}} of plate girders stiffened with one sided rectangular longitudinal stiffeners under compression and bending, determined {{according to the rules}} given in EN 1993 - 1 - 5. It presents the rules for determination of plate buckling effects due to direct stresses. Compression and bending resistance was calculated {{for a wide range of}} cross sections, using the computer program EXCEL, and the effects of different parameters were studied. The parameters investigated were: the location of the stiffener, the slenderness of the plate, the plate aspect ratio, the stiffener to plate area ratio, the flange to web area ratio, the steel grade and the web height. Separate calculations were made for three different cases: I-girder stiffened with one or two longitudinal stiffeners under bending and plate stiffened with n longitudinal stiffeners under compression. In EN 1993 - 1 - 5 the effects of plate buckling are taken into account by effective cross sectional areas, determined by reduction factors which depend on elastic <b>critical</b> buckling <b>stresses.</b> Calculation of <b>critical</b> <b>stresses</b> is based on simplified models which may have limited applicability. Elastic <b>critical</b> buckling <b>stresses</b> were calculated more accurately by using computer program EBPlate (energy method). In addition to the comparison of <b>critical</b> <b>stresses</b> we were interested in the effect that the different <b>critical</b> <b>stresses</b> have on the section resistance. Therefore, the <b>critical</b> plate buckling <b>stress</b> in the expressions given by EN 1993 - 1 - 5 was replaced by <b>critical</b> <b>stresses</b> from EBPlate calculation. The comparison of the results of both methods of calculation showed that the differences in <b>critical</b> <b>stresses</b> were differently reflected in the results for section resistance...|$|R

It is working and <b>critical</b> <b>stresses</b> of parts, stress distribution, as well as, degree of overlapping the working and <b>critical</b> <b>stresses.</b> Working stresses of basic elements and their distribution are sizes which may be relative easy determined, as analytical so as experimental. However, determinations of distribution of <b>critical</b> <b>stresses,</b> spilling, as well as shape of distribution are very complicated if there is stochastic change of working stresses (working strength). By that, character of change of working stresses has essential impact on parameters of working dynamic strength. In this paper it was shown how model of calculation of working dynamic strength, it distributions, as well as interval of result spilling, can be established. Results of established model are shown for material steel by type P- 18 A as material which is often used for manufacturing basic machine parts.

40|$|This paper investigates why the {{observed}} <b>critical</b> Shields <b>stress</b> for incipient sediment motion deviates from the Shields curve. This deviation {{is often described}} in the literature as due to measurement errors and non-uniformity of channel-bed slope or flows. On the contrary, this paper hypothesises the deviation as due {{to the presence of}} vertical velocity in open channel flows. We found that the existence of vertical velocity in non-uniform flows can lead to the deviation of <b>critical</b> shear <b>stress</b> from the standard Shield 2 ̆ 7 s diagram that is valid only in uniform flows, and the channel bed slope could not contribute to the flow 2 ̆ 7 s non-uniformity. The new hypothesis was successfully tested with the experimental data available in the literature. In addition, a new theory for <b>critical</b> shear <b>stress</b> has been developed, which shows that the decelerating flows promote the mobility of sediment, but accelerating flows constrain its mobility. A unified <b>critical</b> Shields <b>stress</b> for sediment transport has been established, that can predict the <b>critical</b> shear <b>stress</b> for sediment initial motion in both uniform and non-uniform flows...|$|R

The {{geometry of the}} composite consists of a cracked layer, bonded between two half-planes, which is separated by thin, low modulus, interleaves. The interleaves are modeled as uncoupled tension and shear springs. A stress analysis is carried out for a crack which may grow up to and spread along the interface.

An asymptotic analysis reveals logarithmic singularities in the <b>critical</b> <b>stresses</b> for {{the case of a}} broken layer.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study {{molecular}} dynamics simulations were carried out to investigate the deformation of pure FCC aluminum and diamond cubic silicon interfaces under shear stress. A second nearest-neighbor modified embedded atom method was {{used to describe the}} interactions between Al-Al, Si-Si and Al-Si atoms. The <b>critical</b> shear <b>stress</b> (CSS) was determined for various Al/Si and Al/Al interfaces with different alignments and orientations. Structural analyses show that the deformation is localized at approximately 10 Å thickness of the interface in Al. The <b>critical</b> shear <b>stress</b> of Al/Si interface was found to be significantly lower than the <b>critical</b> tensile <b>stress</b> due to the partial stick-slip in sliding. In addition, it has been proven that there is no explicit relationship between shear and tensile <b>critical</b> <b>stresses,</b> which is fundamentally different from isotropic materials, where the shear stress is about half of the tensile stress. The misorientation has a dramatic effect in reducing shear stress at Al/Al interfaces, but has no effect on CSS in Al/Si. As a result, it was shown that introducing Si improves the strength of the interface (and the composite material in general) for different grain orientations...|$|R
