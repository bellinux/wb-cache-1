40|$|Aggregation of {{therapeutic}} antibodies could be generated at different {{steps of the}} manufacturing process, posing the problem for quality <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>produced</b> antibodies. It has been well known that secreted antibodies from recombinant mammalian cells into culture medium can aggregate due to the physicochemical stresses such as media pH and osmolality, cultivation temperature [1, 2]. The antibody aggregation during the cell culture process is difficult to suppress because the cell culture conditions for antibody production are generally optimized for cell culture and growth and not for suppressing the aggregate formation. Here we show the novel strategy to suppress the antibody aggregation; application of chemical chaper-one to the cell culture process. It is well established that an addition of some cosolutes serves as chemical chaper...|$|R

40|$|One of {{activities}} of the Mining and Metallurgy Institute is production of thermocouple elements made of precious metals. Since this is a complex technological process and the quality <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>produced</b> elements is performed by other institutions, sometimes the whole series of products can happen to be bad and not useful. This is increasing costs and time of production, as well. To prevent wasting of time and money, the special measuring system is developed. The kernel {{of the system is}} already existing microprocessor measuring station - MMS. The MMS’s hardware configuration, initially designed for industrial process control requirements with suitable input channel characteristics and adequate response time is adapted for the purpose of thermocouple calibration. Appropriate software solution is developed, as well. This article describes the practical solution for thermocouple testing and calibration. Hardware interface, principles of system integration and developed software are also included. ...|$|R
