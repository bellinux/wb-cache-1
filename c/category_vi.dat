40|$|Objective: Patients {{categorized}} Rutherford category IV {{might have}} different characteristics compared with Rutherford <b>category</b> V and <b>VI.</b> Our study aims were {{to estimate the}} clinical differences between Rutherford category IV and Rutherford <b>category</b> V and <b>VI,</b> for those underwent endovascular therapy for isolated infrapopliteal disease, and also to find risk factors for endovascular therapy in Rutherford category IV. Methods: Based on the Japanese multi-center registry data, 1091 patients with 1332 limbs (Rutherford category IV: 226 patients with 315 limbs, Rutherford category V and VI: 865 patients with 1017 limbs) were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Patients’ backgrounds and lesions’ characteristics had significant differences. Both freedom rate from major adverse limb event with perioperative death and amputation-free survival rate at 1 [*]year were better in Rutherford category IV than Rutherford <b>category</b> V and <b>VI</b> (93. 6 % vs 78. 3 %, 87. 7 % vs 66. 7 %) and those maintained to 3 [*]years (p[*] [*] 3. 0 [*]mg/dL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and coronary artery disease in Rutherford category IV.

Part II presents arguments for or against the use of GM-products. Part III explores the concept of ecolabeling by analyzing the general goals of such programs, including the economic theory behind green consumerism and the characteristics necessary for effective schemes. Part IV describes the core objectives and features of the EC regulations. To provide a framework for analyzing the EC regulations under the WTO regime, Part V sorts eco-labeling schemes into different <b>categories.</b> Part <b>VI</b> examines the legality of the EC 2 ̆ 7 s regulations under the SPS Agreement, the TBT Agreement and GATT 1994. Finally, Part VII presents a proposal for a trade-sensitive regime. This Note illustrates that the EC regulations run afoul of several WTO provisions, but argues that it is possible to develop an eco-labeling program to assuage consumer concerns over GMOs without violating WTO Agreement and without the need to resort to a new watered-down treaty...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{definition}} of conservation targets is strategic {{for the protection}} of biodiversity and must ensure the representativeness and persistence of biodiversity components. This is especially critical in fast-disappearing ecosystems, such as in the Cerrado, where opportunities for conservation are rapidly diminishing. We evaluate how different categories of protected areas (PAs) in the Cerrado contribute to achieve the 17 % conservation target defined by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Deforestation rates in sustainable use PAs (IUCN <b>categories</b> IV to <b>VI)</b> are similar to those outside PAs, indicating they are not adequate to ensure the protection of biodiversity. Conversely, strict PAs exhibit significantly less deforestation and should form most of the target content. Because strict PAs represent only 3 % of the Cerrado, Brazil is far from achieving the 17 % target defined by the Convention on Biological Diversity. Urgent measures toward the creation of strict PAs in the Cerrado are needed, to ensure the representativeness and persistence of its conspicuous biodiversity...|$|R
