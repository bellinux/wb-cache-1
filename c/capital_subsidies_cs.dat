40|$|Subsidised {{energy prices}} in pre-transition Hungary {{had led to}} {{excessive}} energy intensity in the agricultural sector. Transition has resulted in steep input price increases. In this study, Allen and Morishima elasticities of substitution are estimated to {{study the effects of}} these price changes on energy use, chemical input use, capital formation and employment. Panel data methods, Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) and instrument exogeneity tests are used to specify and estimate technology and substitution elasticities. Results indicate that indirect price policy may be effective in controlling energy consumption. The sustained increases in energy and chemical input prices have worked together to restrict energy and chemical input use, and the substitutability between energy, capital and labour has prevented the capital shrinkage and agricultural unemployment situations from being worse. The Hungarian push towards lower energy intensity may be best pursued through sustained energy price increases rather than <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies.</b> (<b>C)</b> 2003 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the {{implications}} of firm-oriented fiscal policies, such as <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies</b> and tax allowances, in an economy with an underground sector. In addition, we investigate whether the technology structure of “hidden” production may facilitate or counteract the effects of fiscal policies on firm behavior. Among our results we stress the following: first, <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies</b> promote tax evasion; these subsidies induce firms to increase actual capital accumulation (a level effect), but also produce a reduction in the regular share of aggregate capital stock (a composition effect). Second, tax relief reduces underground activities and fosters capital accumulation, as well as aggregate production.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the nexus among {{selected}} firm-oriented fiscal policies (tax relief and <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies),</b> physical <b>capital</b> accumulation and underground activities.

In addition, we investigate whether the technology structure of “hidden” production may facilitate or counteract the effects (the effectiveness) of the fiscal policies on firm behavior. Subsidies programmes and tax advantages for “infant” industries or depressed areas are often justified because the industry is not competitive enough and prices do not show full flexibility. However, granting <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies</b> and tax allowances to firms has also important implications for underground activities and tax evasion. Underground activities occur in many countries, and there are significant indications that this phenomenon is large and increasing.

We discover that the employment effects of the subsidies studied differ significatively, while whether the subsidy hike is financed by an increase of payroll taxation or a decrease of employment subsidization is immaterial for the qualitative effects on the macroeconomic system. In the neoclassical-equilibrium theory, a <b>capital</b> <b>subsidy</b> causes a temporary increase in hours worked which vanishes in the new long-run, while an increase in labor subsidy has no aggregative effects on the macroeconomic equilibrium.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 El Salvador's land {{resources}} are intensively cultivated. Labor is relatively abundant and wages are low. This study analyzed {{the effects of}} government policies and observed farm price distortions on enterprise/weed control system choices and associated income-employment effects. A regional linear programming framework was employed to analyze the effects of alternative government policies and observed farm prices on farm efficiency, employment, and income distribution within Central El Salvador. A major conclusion {{of the study was}} that the presence of price distortions and off-farm employment alternatives were not sufficient to induce changes in weed control technology on small and medium farms. The most efficient system both from an individual and social point of view was the use of manual weed control for all selected enterprises. The principal effects of price distortions on the small and medium farms (when compared with their undistorted price solutions) were the tendencies {{to reduce the number of}} selected enterprises and to modify the area allocated between enterprises. On the other hand, the process of capital-labor substitution on large farm appeared to be sensitive to direct and indirect government <b>subsidies</b> on <b>capital</b> when off-farm employment alternatives existed between 0 and 50 percent of total available labor supply. Herbicide-area diffusion ranged from 75 to 87 percent of total area on the large farm whenever the policy mix included direct or indirect <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies.</b> Comparisons of the alternative distorted price solutions using the undistorted price solutions revealed that whenever <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies</b> were present in any policy mix when off-farm employment opportunities were held at 50 percent of the available labor supply, total weed control employment levels were lower than the social price solution by 45 to 55 percent. The group most seriously affected by weed control employment reductions was the landless laborer. The group's weed control employment losses ranged from 73 to 89 percent below their social price-employment solution. The presence of <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies</b> in any policy mix under the 50 percent off-farm employment opportunity solutions induced relatively larger income gains (20 to 67 percent) to the three sizes of farms and income losses (3 to 13 percent) to the landless laborers. Production efficiency losses were relatively high in each of the three sizes of farms whenever <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies</b> were present. In view of these findings the El Salvador government should recognize a conflict between the use of direct and indirect <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies</b> particularly on herbicides and farm machinery and between stated national goals of increasing employment and improving income distribution. Fixing the wage rate at 3. 85 cents/day induced relative income gains that tend to favor the small farm and landless laborers... the least privileged and the biggest group in El Salvadors' total population. Output support induced equal relative income gains (19 percent) to the three sizes of farms.

Instead, the capital-taxation prescriptions of the underlying purely real economy in such models carry over unchanged, qualitatively and very nearly quantitatively, to the monetary economy. In this pa-per, we employ a micro-founded model of money in order to more meaningfully connect optimal fiscal and monetary policy, with a particular focus on optimal capital taxation.
