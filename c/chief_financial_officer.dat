However, Enron did not want to show any debt from assuming CalPERS' stake in JEDI on its balance sheet. <b>Chief</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Officer</b> (CFO) Fastow developed the special purpose entity Chewco Investments limited partnership (L.P.) which raised debt guaranteed by Enron and was used to acquire CalPERS's joint venture stake for $383 million.

40|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have suggested that}} females are less sensitive than males to condi-tions of salary underpayment and have coined the term paradoxical female. To test the hypothesis addressing the paradoxical female and to examine reactions of females and males within competing models for pay satisfaction, {{a random sample of}} <b>chief</b> <b>financial</b> <b>officers</b> was selected and assessed. Results indicate that female <b>chief</b> <b>financial</b> <b>officers,</b> unlike male <b>chief</b> <b>financial</b> <b>officers,</b> receiving less than their entitled salaries enjoyed the same level of pay satisfaction as both female and male <b>chief</b> <b>financial</b> <b>officers</b> receiving more than their entitled salaries. Pay satisfaction, as defined by a referent source, was found to vary by gender of <b>chief</b> <b>financial</b> <b>officers</b> and to follow a linear, as opposed to a curvilinear, model. Employment has been conceptualized as an exchange relationship between organizations as employers and individuals as employees (Rous-seau, 1990). “At the core of the employment exchange between organizations and individuals ” is compensation (Gerhart & Milkovich, 1992, p. 481). “Taken literally, compensation means to counterbalance, to offset, to make up for. So compensation makes up for the effort an employee exerts on the employer’s behalf ” (Milkovich & Newman, 1996, p. 9). Compensation is provided by organizations and received by employees, and has instrumental value “to purchase desired goods and services, for status and prestige, and for self validation ” (Rice, Phillips, & McFarlin, 1990, p. 387). If the employment exchange relationship is to be sustained between organizations and individuals, then both parties expect a certain level of justice to prevail. Justice, as it relates to compensation within the employment exchange relationship, involves some general notion of equal pay for equal work...|$|R

The following year, Boeing announced the KC-767 Tanker Transport, a second military derivative of the 767-200ER. Launched with an order in October 2002 from the Italian Air Force, the KC-767 was intended for the dual role of refueling other aircraft and carrying cargo.
