If the alien {{is already in the}} USA, that alien has a choice to finalize the green <b>card</b> <b>process</b> via adjustment of status in the USA, or via consular processing abroad. If the alien is outside of the USA he/she can only apply for an immigrant visa at the U.S. consulate. The USCIS does not allow an alien to pursue consular processing and AOS simultaneously. Prior to filing the form I-485 (Adjustment of Status) it is required that the applicant have a medical examination performed by a USCIS-approved civil surgeon. [...] The examination includes a blood test and specific immunizations, unless the applicant provides proof that the required immunizations were already done elsewhere. The civil surgeon hands the applicant a sealed envelope containing a completed form I-693, which must be included unopened with the I-485 application.

40|$|Usually, a <b>carding</b> <b>process</b> is {{difficult}} to control with classic control algorithms (such as PID) for three main reasons: strong stochastic disturbance, time delays, and parameter variation. In this paper, generalized predictive control (GPC) is introduced to control such a process. First, a CARIMA model is built to describe the <b>carding</b> <b>process,</b> then the GPC control law is derived and used to design the controller for a carding autoleveler. The simulation {{results show that the}} GPC controller can greatly reduce a sliver's standard deviation and can reject measured and unmeasured step disturbance. Although this paper mainly involves the design of a feedforward-feedback GPC controller for a carding autoleveler, the methods of modeling and GPC controller design can easily be extended to a feedback case and used to design controllers for other preparatory machines' autolevelers.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} parameters to be controlled during the production of textile yarns obtained by mixing pre-colored fibers, is the color correspondence between the manufactured yarn and a given reference, usually provided by a designer or a customer. Obtaining yarns from raw pre-colored fibers is a complex manufacturing process entailing a number of steps such as laboratory sampling, color recipe corrections, blowing, carding and spinning. <b>Carding</b> <b>process</b> is the one devoted to transform a “fuzzy mass” of tufted fibers into a regular mass of untwisted fibers, named “tow”. During this process, unfortunately, the correspondence between the color of the tow and the target one cannot be assured, thus leading to yarns whose color differs from the one used for reference. To solve this issue, the main aim of this work is to provide a system able to perform a spectral camera-based real-time measurement of a carded tow, to assess its color correspondence with a reference carded fabric and, at the same time, to monitor the overall quality of the tow during the <b>carding</b> <b>process.</b> Tested against a number of differently colored carded fabrics, the proposed system proved its effectiveness in reliably assessing color correspondence in real-time...|$|R

However, because of the newly enhanced background check and criminal history data trail requirements, the new law had initially been interpreted by the Bureau of Consular Affairs and USCIS as leaving Consular officers ill-equipped to fully handle the I-130 adjucation process. Thus, as of January 2007, I-130 petitions, supporting documentation, or fee payments could no longer be completed in the country of the foreign national.|$|E
