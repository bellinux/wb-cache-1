5000|$|Any {{distribution}} whatever of {{the means}} of consumption is only a consequence of the distribution of the conditions of production themselves. The latter distribution, however, is a feature of the mode of production itself. The capitalist mode of production, for example, rests {{on the fact that the}} material conditions of production are in the hands of nonworkers in the form of property in capital and land, while the masses are only owners of the personal condition of production, of labor power. If the elements of production are so distributed, then the present-day distribution {{of the means}} of consumption results automatically. If the material conditions of production are the <b>co-operative</b> <b>property</b> of the workers themselves, then there likewise results a distribution {{of the means of}} consumption different from the present one. Vulgar socialism (and from it in turn a section of the democrats) has taken over from the bourgeois economists the consideration and treatment of distribution as independent of the mode of production and hence the presentation of socialism as turning principally on distribution. After the real relation has long been made clear, why retrogress again? http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm ...|$|E

Essential {{to the success of}} this study is the selection of suitable synthetic routes (aerosol and nanocasting) that allow the preparation of materials with different matrix characteristics (carbon, silica, and polymers with controlled porosity). These materials present magnetic properties that depend on the average particle size and the degree of polydispersity. Finally, the analysis of the co-operative behavior of samples allows for the detection of signatures of clustering, which are closely related to the textural characteristics of samples and the methodology used to produce the magnetic carriers. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The estate {{was set on}} a small artificial hill, to provide views, protect the estate from flooding, and (potentially) shield it from hazards of waste dumped underneath. [...] A community centre (complete with shop, café, function hall, and training room), which also housed the housing office, was added in 1982.

40|$|Tyrosinases, {{which are}} widely {{distributed}} among animals, plants and fungi, {{are involved in}} many biologically essential functions, including pigmentation, sclerotization, primary immune response and host defence. In the present study, we present a structural and physicochemical characterization of two new tyrosinases from the crustaceans Palinurus elephas (European spiny lobster) and Astacus leptodactylus (freshwater crayfish). In vivo, the purified crustacean tyrosinases occur as hexamers composed of one subunit type with a molecular mass of approx. 71 kDa. The tyrosinase hexamers appear {{to be similar to}} the haemocyanins, based on electron microscopy. Thus a careful purification protocol was developed to discriminate clearly between tyrosinases and the closely related haemocyanins. The physicochemical properties of haemocyanins and tyrosinases are different with respect to electronegativity and hydrophobicity. The hexameric nature of arthropod tyrosinases suggests that these proteins were the ideal predecessors from which to develop the oxygen-carrier protein haemocyanin, with its allosteric and <b>co-operative</b> <b>properties,</b> later on...|$|R

40|$|The {{structures}} of 5 -aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) complexed with substrate (5 -aminolaevulinic acid) and three inhibitors: laevulinic acid, succinylacetone and 4 -keto- 5 -aminolaevulinic acid, have been solved at high resolution. The ligands all bind by forming a covalent link with Lys 263 at the active site. The structures de®ne the interactions made {{by one of}} the two substrate moieties that bind to the enzyme during catalysis. All of the inhibitors induce a signi®cant ordering of the ¯ap covering the active site. Succinylacetone appears to be unique by inducing a number of conformational changes in loops covering the active site, which may be important for understanding the <b>co-operative</b> <b>properties</b> of ALAD enzymes. Succinylacetone is produced in large amounts by patients suffering from the hereditary disease type I tyrosinaemia and its potent inhibition of ALAD also has implications for the pathology of this disease. The most intriguing result is that obtained with 4 -keto- 5 -aminohexanoic acid, which seems to form a stable carbinolamine intermediate with Lys 263. It appears that we have de®ned the structure of an intermediate of Schiff base formation that the substrate forms upon binding to the P-site of the enzyme...|$|R

40|$|The ARE (AU-rich element) is a post-transcriptional element {{controlling}} both mRNA turnover and translation initiation by primarily inducing poly(A) tail shortening. The {{mechanisms by}} which the ARE-associated proteins induce deadenylation are still obscure. One possibility among others would be that an ARE–ARE-BP (ARE-binding protein) complex intervenes in the PABP [poly(A) -binding protein]–poly(A) tail association and facilitates poly(A) tail accessibility to deadenylases. Here, we show by several experimental approaches that AUF 1 (AU-rich element RNA-binding protein 1) /hnRNP (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein) D, an mRNA-destabilizing ARE-BP, can bind poly(A) sequence in vitro. First, endogenous AUF 1 proteins from HeLa cells specifically bound poly(A), independently of PABP. Secondly, using polyadenylated RNA probes, we showed that (i) the four recombinant AUF 1 isoforms bind poly(A) as efficiently as PABP, (ii) the AUF 1 binding to poly(A) does not change when the polyadenylated probe contains the GM-CSF (granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor) ARE, suggesting that, in vitro, the AUF 1 –poly(A) association was independent of the ARE sequence itself. In vitro, the binding of AUF 1 isoforms to poly(A) displayed oligomeric and <b>co-operative</b> <b>properties</b> and AUF 1 efficiently displaced PABP from the poly(A). Finally, the AUF 1 molar concentration in HeLa cytoplasm was only 2 -fold {{lower than that of}} PABP, whereas in the nucleus, its molar concentration was similar to that of PABP. These in vitro results suggest that, in vivo, AUF 1 could compete with PABP for the binding to poly(A). Altogether, our results may suggest a role for AUF 1 in controlling PABP–poly(A) tail association...|$|R

40|$|Many diseases, {{including}} Alzheimer's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, {{are believed}} {{to be the result of}} protein misfolding and aggregation into insoluble, highly ordered Β-sheet structures known as amyloid fibrils. The mechanism of formation of these fibrils is unknown. The work presented in this thesis uses human cystatin B as a model system for the elucidation of the mechanism of fibril formation. Cystatin B, a cysteine protease inhibitor, readily forms amyloid fibrils in vitro. Amyloid fibrils formed from the structurally homologous cystatin C, are associated with a form of cerebral haemorrhage as well as incorporation in amyloid derived from Alzheimer's disease sufferers. The work in this thesis sheds light on the mechanism by which proteins spontaneously change conformation and self associate to form amyloid fibrils. Investigation of the state induced by conditions of fibrillisation and the effects of single point mutations highlight particular regions within the natively folded protein that are involved in the self association process. Studies on Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + binding to cystatin B highlight the same small regions of importance and show that the effect induced by divalent metals is very metal specific. It is also shown that fibrillisation of cystatin B is preceded by aggregation into a large insoluble structure. This may act to increase local concentration by protein adsorption and involve unknown surface interactions that induce or catalyse the initiation of fibrillisation. The interactions and conformational changes required for fibrillisation are likely to be local rather than global events which require the weakening of the <b>co-operative</b> <b>properties</b> normally associated with protein folding. Alteration of these interactions will promote alternative pathways of assembly resulting in different "strains" of amyloid. Ultimately the high resolution structure of cystatin B fibrils will answer many questions and the initial solid state NMR experiments to achieve this are presented in this thesis.

40|$|The {{cationic}} tear proteins lactoferrin and lysozyme exhibit <b>co-operative</b> antistaphylococcal <b>properties.</b> The {{purpose of}} this study was to determine the mechanism of action of this co-operation on Staphylococcus epidermidis. Following blocking of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) binding sites, the effects on binding of lactoferrin and susceptibility to lactoferrin and lysozyme were determined. The effect of lactoferrin on autolysis and LTA release was also examined. Maximal susceptibility occurred on addition of lactoferrin first followed by lysozyme. Blocking the LTA binding sites both reduced lactoferrin binding and decreased susceptibility. Autolytic activity decreased and LTA release increased in the presence of lactoferrin. These results suggest that binding of lactoferrin to LTA is important in its synergy with lysozyme and interferes with the autolysins present on the LTA. It is proposed that, on binding to the anionic LTA of S. epidermidis, the cationic protein lactoferrin decreases the negative charge, allowing greater accessibility of lysozyme to the underlying peptidoglycan...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: With {{calls to}} replace some of Australia’s {{domestic}} livestock production with native alternatives, we investigate a multi-species grazing scenario. As {{part of a}} portfolio optimisation analysis of the stocking options, a model {{is needed to determine}} the populations of the different species over time. A system of differential equations is used to simulate the interactions between cattle and kangaroos in Australian rangelands. They are used to explore the possibility of converting a property from one focussing on domestic stock, in this case cattle, to a native roving stock, kangaroos. Of particular interest is the income from commodities produced and the effects of the macropods breeding rate and migration on financial returns. To this end, we show that using current pricing and preferences, the land holder could improve returns in theory by utilising native resources instead, or in conjunction with, domestic livestock. An important reason for this is the comparatively high reproduction rate for kangaroos and the arrival of extra stock from other properties and/or national parks. In particular three scenarios were investigated: Both properties continue a cattle enterprise considering kangaroos as pests. A property continues a cattle enterprise considering kangaroos as pests, while the other starts converting to a kangaroo enterprise (in effect a <b>co-operative</b> strategy). Both <b>properties</b> convert to kangaroo enterprises (a competitive strategy) ...|$|R
40|$|In Germany exist a {{large number}} of co-operatives that are engaged in a broad variety of {{business}} activities. Their organisational structure is determined by co-operative law and to a lesser degree by statutes or by-laws. As has been shown for German rural <b>co-operatives</b> by applying <b>property</b> rights theory the corporate governance structure as determined by law is formally still in existence, while it actually has been shifted in favour of the executive board. This has created an imbalance where on the one hand no longer any corporate governance is actually taking place while on the other hand members' interests may easily be neglected, because it is the executive board that determines the members' interests and also whether they have benefited from the cooperatives activities. In theory, suitable instruments to improve the corporate governance structure within such co-operative are the promotion plan and the promotion report as developed by Boettcher. However, for transaction cost reasons and due to the current attenuation of property rights, it is unlikely that these instruments will be implemented without outside pressure, e. g. through a change in cooperative law. A superior alternative to promotion plan and promotion report may be a combination of promotion task controlling and member oriented quality management. While such instruments would indeed improve members' ability to execute co-operative governance, managers' willingness to submit themselves to stronger governance may well be assumed to be very low. Taking into account the current distribution of property rights in big German co-operatives, managers will accept stronger governance structures only if some other incentives exist. An ongoing research project indicates that such incentives might exist in the realm of improved business opportunities due to better information about members' aims and needs. [...] ...|$|R
