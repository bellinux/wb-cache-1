40|$|In April 1976 {{the attack}} rate of chills and fever {{with or without}} falls in blood {{pressure}} increased in association with <b>cardiac</b> <b>catheterizations.</b> Fevers were associated with coronary angiography and right and left heart catheterizations. Blood cultures were negative, and reactions did not correlate with amounts of contrast materials infused or with procedures done by a single operator. Significant numbers of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (var. anitratus) and a Pseudomonas species were cultured from hospital-reservoir distilled water when it was flushed through a catheter before gas sterilization. This same water after ethylene oxide sterilization contained 2 x 105 ng/mL of endotoxin by limulus lysate test and was positive by rabbit pyrogen test. When washed reusable cardiac catheters were sterilized daily or when disposable catheters were substituted, febrile reactions ended. Pyrogenic reactions in patients undergoing <b>cardiac</b> <b>catheterizations</b> corrrelated with emptying retained endotoxin with injected contrast material from reused washed-sterilized catheters. FROM JULY 1976 through March 1977, a marked in-crease in pyrogenic reactions occurred in patients under-going diagnostic <b>cardiac</b> <b>catheterizations</b> at Hutzel Hos-pital within the Wayne State University-Detroit Medical Center.

5000|$|Despite the {{evidence}} of decades of absence of reports, in any condition where electrical conductors are run into the body in proximity of the heart (i.e. <b>cardiac</b> <b>catheterizations)</b> precautions are still taken to ensure hazardous current is not introduced through these conductors {{and it is still}} regarded as a high risk activity.|$|R
25|$|In {{some parts}} of the world, the {{emergency}} medical service also encompasses the role of moving patients from one medical facility to an alternative one; usually to facilitate the provision of a higher level or more specialized field of care but also to transfer patients from a specialized facility to a local hospital or nursing home when they no longer require the services of that specialized hospital, such as following successful <b>cardiac</b> <b>catheterization</b> due to a heart attack. In such services, the EMS is not summoned by members of the public but by clinical professionals (e.g. physicians or nurses) in the referring facility. Specialized hospitals that provide higher levels of care may include services such as neonatal intensive care (NICU), pediatric intensive care (PICU), state regional burn centres, specialized care for spinal injury and/or neurosurgery, regional stroke centers, specialized cardiac care (<b>Cardiac</b> <b>catheterization),</b> and specialized/regional trauma care.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous {{fentanyl}} {{is often}} used for anaesthesia and analgesia. During anaesthesia it {{is often used}} along with a hypnotic agent like propofol.

25|$|Lidocaine is {{also the}} most {{important}} class-1b antiarrhythmic drug; it is used intravenously for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias (for acute myocardial infarction, digoxin poisoning, cardioversion, or <b>cardiac</b> <b>catheterization)</b> if amiodarone is not available or contraindicated. Lidocaine should be given for this indication after defibrillation, CPR, and vasopressors have been initiated. A routine preventative dose is no longer recommended after a myocardial infarction as the overall benefit is not convincing.|$|E
25|$|Patients who do {{not respond}} to initial treatment, defined as left {{ventricular}} EF remaining below 20% at two months or below 40% at three months with conventional treatment may merit further investigation, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), <b>cardiac</b> <b>catheterization,</b> and endomyocardial biopsy for special staining and for viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Antiviral therapy, immunoabsorption, intravenous gamma globulin, or other immunomodulation therapy may then be considered accordingly, but following a controlled research-type protocol.|$|E
25|$|As {{the prices}} {{for health care}} {{increased}} in the 1980s, the hospital was forced to once again adopt a modernization program {{to keep up with}} the times. Over the next decade, the plan called for the construction of a Surgical and Ancillary Services Building on the Rowe Street side of the building and the addition of a parking garage on Lebanon Street. Later renovations included the construction a nursery and new labor and delivery suites in the Maternity Ward and the addition of the Cummings Rehabilitation Center and a <b>cardiac</b> <b>catheterization</b> laboratory.|$|E

25|$|Fluoroscopy is an imaging {{technique}} commonly used by physicians or radiation therapists to obtain real-time moving {{images of the}} internal structures of a patient {{through the use of}} a fluoroscope. In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which a patient is placed. However, modern fluoroscopes couple the screen to an X-ray image intensifier and CCD video camera allowing the images to be recorded and played on a monitor. This method may use a contrast material. Examples include <b>cardiac</b> <b>catheterization</b> (to examine for coronary artery blockages) and barium swallow (to examine for esophageal disorders).|$|E
500|$|Lung AVMs may be {{suspected}} {{because of}} the abnormal appearance of the lungs on a chest X-ray, or hypoxia (low oxygen levels) on pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas determination. Bubble contrast echocardiography (bubble echo) {{may be used as}} a screening tool to identify abnormal connections between the lung arteries and veins. This involves the injection of agitated saline into a vein, followed by ultrasound-based imaging of the heart. Normally, the lungs remove small air bubbles from the circulation, and they are therefore only seen in the right atrium and the right ventricle. If an AVM is present, bubbles appear in the left atrium and left ventricle, usually 3–10 cardiac cycles after the right side; this is slower than in heart defects, in which there are direct connections between the right and left side of the heart. A larger number of bubbles is more likely to indicate the presence of an AVM. Bubble echo is not a perfect screening tool as it can miss smaller AVMs and does not identify the site of AVMs. [...] Often contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT angiography) is used to identify lung lesions; this modality has a sensitivity of over 90%. It may be possible to omit contrast administration on modern CT scanners. Echocardiography is also used if there is a suspicion of pulmonary hypertension or high-output cardiac failure due to large liver lesions, sometimes followed by <b>cardiac</b> <b>catheterization</b> to measure the pressures inside the various chambers of the heart.|$|E

30|$|An itemized bill of {{individual}} charges for each patient {{was obtained from}} the hospital billing office and was organized by billing code into the following categories: room/board, pharmacy, supplies, laboratory, radiology, surgical (including procedures performed under general anesthesia), blood products, respiratory services, dialysis, and miscellaneous (which included some professional fees, nonsurgical procedures and phlebotomy, and diagnostics not included in the other categories, such as electroencephalograms, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, <b>cardiac</b> <b>catheterizations,</b> and vascular studies). The values represent the hospital charges for the aforementioned services rather than the actual reimbursement, which may be subject to more variability. The single-center nature of the study removes interfacility differences in clinical and billing practices.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{effectiveness}} of aspirin and clopidogrel {{in patients with}} chronic kidney disease (CKD) suffering from acute cardiovascular events is unclear. High on treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) {{has been associated with}} worse outcomes. Here, we assessed the association of dipstick proteinuria (DP) and renal function on HTPR and clinical outcomes. Retrospective cohort analysis of 261 consecutive, non-dialysis patients admitted for Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) that had VerifyNow P 2 Y 12 and VerifyNow Aspirin assays performed. HTPR was defined as P 2 Y 12 reactivity unit (PRU) [*] 3 ̆e[*] 208 for clopidogrel and aspirin reaction units (ARU) [*] 3 ̆e[*] 550 for aspirin. Renal function was classified based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and dipstick proteinuria was defined as ≥ 30 [*]mg/dl of albumin detected on a spot analysis. All cause mortality, readmissions, and <b>cardiac</b> <b>catheterizations</b> were reviewed over 520 days. In patients on clopidogrel (n[*]=[*] 106), DP was associated with HTPR, independent of eGFR, diabetes mellitus, smoking or use of proton pump inhibitor (AOR[*]=[*] 4. 76, p[*]=[*] 0. 03). In patients with acute coronary syndromes, HTPR was associated with more <b>cardiac</b> <b>catheterizations</b> (p[*]=[*] 0. 009) and readmissions (p[*]=[*] 0. 032), but no differences in in-stent thrombosis or re-stenosis were noted in this cohort. In patients on aspirin (n[*]=[*] 155), no associations were seen between DP and HTPR. However, all cause mortality was significantly higher with HTPR in this group (p[*]=[*] 0. 038). In this cohort, DP is an independent predictor of HTPR in patients on clopidogrel, but not aspirin, admitted to the hospital for MACE...|$|R
