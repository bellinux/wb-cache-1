5000|$|Easements are {{distinct}} from restrictive covenants {{and the court}} will not allow the creation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>easement</b> where the right is in substance a restrictive covenant.

40|$|The thesis {{introduces}} <b>a</b> right-of-way <b>easement</b> {{as defined}} in the regulations of the Republic of Slovenia. An analysis of the existing methods of valuating the effect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> right-of-way <b>easement</b> on {{the market value of}} land is conducted where the methods included are obtained from the Slovenian and foreign practice. However, since lack of public data on the activity in the real estate market prevents any analysis of the afore-mentioned effect, the objectification of the effect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> right-of-way <b>easement</b> on the market value of land is carried out by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> survey on public opinion as provided in {{the last part of the}} thesis. The outcome of the analysis on the interwiewees' opinion regarding any decrease in the market value of land in case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> right-of-way <b>easement</b> is delivered in a table, including a percentage decrease in the market value of land in case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> right-of-way <b>easement...</b>|$|R
50|$|The most {{problematic}} characteristic <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>easement</b> {{is that it}} must {{be capable}} <b>of</b> forming <b>a</b> grant by deed. The right must therefore be certain and definite in its purpose, and more importantly, that the courts are willing to recognise it as <b>a</b> right capable <b>of</b> being <b>an</b> <b>easement.</b> Many claimed rights fail this last criterion, for example, rights which require positive action by the owner <b>of</b> <b>a</b> servient tenement are unlikely to be granted, as are negative rights, which restrict the use of land. Rights which are excessive in nature are equally unlikely to be upheld. In Copeland v Greenhalf a claim to store unlimited vehicles on a neighbour's land failed, with the interference and right claimed being too great to be allowed as <b>an</b> <b>easement.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{requirement}} - {{that there}} must be two distinct plots of land affected - is central to the definition <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>easement.</b> <b>A</b> right <b>of</b> way granted to an individual is granted in their capacity as a land owner; if <b>a</b> right <b>of</b> way is granted to an individual who is not a land owner, it is merely a license.|$|R
25|$|When a {{property}} owner misrepresents the existence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>easement</b> while selling <b>a</b> property {{and does not}} include in the deed to the buyer <b>an</b> express <b>easement</b> over <b>an</b> adjoining property that the seller owns, a court may step in and create <b>an</b> <b>easement.</b> Easements by estoppel generally look to any promises not made in writing, any money spent by the benefiting party in reliance on the representations of the burdened party, and other factors. If the court finds that the buyer acted reasonably and in good faith and relied on the seller's promises, the court may create <b>an</b> <b>easement</b> by estoppel.|$|R
40|$|Easements are {{interests}} in land of ancient origin.

50|$|I {{think that}} the right claimed goes wholly outside any normal idea <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>easement,</b> that is, {{the right of the}} owner or the {{occupier}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dominant tenement over a servient tenement.

5000|$|Easements {{are also}} {{separate}} from natural rights, which operate universally {{and do not}} have to be created. Some natural rights appear similar to easements. For example, there is a natural right to support of one's land. This does not, however, extend to buildings upon the land or the consequences on the land of building upon it. The operate of prescription to bring about <b>a</b> right <b>of</b> support of buildings as well as land in the form <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>easement</b> limits the operation of this natural right, however. Natural rights are only actionable after the fact [...] - [...] where damage has already occurred; the neighbouring landowner cannot be compelled to take preventative steps or give support in any particular fashion. The right to water from a stream or river is another natural right which may be extended through the operation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>easement.</b> Easements in this area must also be considered in light of statutory regimes, particularly in the commercial context. There is also a public right to fish and navigate on the foreshore, although this is limited in several respects.|$|R

25|$|Because {{this method}} <b>of</b> {{creating}} <b>an</b> <b>easement</b> requires imposing <b>a</b> burden (the <b>easement)</b> upon another {{party for the}} benefit of the landlocked owner, the court looks to the original circumstances in weighing the relative apportionment of benefit and burden to both lots in making its equitable determination whether such easement shall be created by the court. This method <b>of</b> creating <b>an</b> <b>easement,</b> being <b>an</b> active creation by <b>a</b> court <b>of</b> <b>an</b> otherwise non-existent right, may be automatically extinguished upon termination of the necessity (for example, if a new public road is built adjacent to the landlocked tenement or another easement is acquired without regard to comparison of ease or practicality between the imposed easement and any valid substitute).|$|R

25|$|Despite the name, {{necessity}} {{alone is}} an insufficient claim to create any easement.

A court order is necessary to determine the existence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>easement</b> by necessity. To obtain this generally the party who claims the <b>easement</b> files <b>a</b> lawsuit, and the judge weighs the relative damage caused by enforcing <b>an</b> <b>easement</b> against the servient estate against the damage to the dominant estate if the easement is found not to exist and is thus landlocked.|$|R
