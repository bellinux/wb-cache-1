40|$|The Minolta CS 100 chromameter was {{interfaced}} to a Macintosh Quadra 800 via a National NB-DIO- 24 digital input/output {{board in}} order to implement unattended acquisition of digital-to-analog conversion values (DACs) corresponding to colours required for psychophysical experimentation. The program was developed and compiled on a Macintosh Quadra 800 with Think C 5. 0. -l-Executive Summary During the course of psychophysical experimentation using computer driven <b>colour</b> <b>monitors,</b> the experimenter requires the monitor to reproduce certain colours of known characteristics (CIE 1931 x, y, Yxy). To create these <b>colours</b> on the <b>monitor,</b> a set of DAC (digital-to-analog conversion) values {{for each of the}} three colour guns must be specified. There are two common methods for obtaining these DACs. If the number of colours required is small, the experimenter can simply measure a test field on the screen with an instrument such as a chromameter, and adjust the DACs by trial and error until suitable DACs are found.

50|$|Oceansat-2 is an Indian {{satellite}} {{designed to}} provide service continuity for operational users of the Ocean <b>Colour</b> <b>Monitor</b> (OCM)instrument on Oceansat-1. It will also enhance the potential of applications in other areas. The main objectives of OceanSat-2 are to study surface winds and ocean surface strata, observation of chlorophyll concentrations, monitoring of phytoplankton blooms, study of atmospheric aerosols and suspended sediments in the water.|$|E
50|$|The CPC 464 was {{eventually}} {{powered by the}} Zilog Z80 processor after the original attempts to use the 6502 processor, {{being used in the}} Commodore 64 and Apple II, failed. The Z80 ran at 4 MHz, had 64K of memory and ran AMSDOS, Amstrad's own OS. The unit included a built in tape drive and the choice of a green or <b>colour</b> <b>monitor.</b> The CPC 464 had 3 display modes.|$|E

50|$|Oceansat-2 {{will carry}} two {{payloads}} for ocean related studies, namely, Ocean <b>Colour</b> <b>Monitor</b> (OCM) and Ku-band Pencil Beam Scatterometer. An additional piggy-back payload called ROSA (Radio Occultation Sounder for Atmospheric studies) {{developed by the}} Italian Space Agency (ASI) is also proposed to be included. The major applications of data from Oceansat-2 are identification of potential fishing zones, sea state forecasting, coastal zone studies and inputs for weather forecasting and climatic studies.|$|E

50|$|The CPC6128 was {{released}} in August 1985 and initially only sold in the USA. Imported and distributed by Indescomp, Inc. of Chicago, {{it was the first}} Amstrad product to be sold in the United States, a market that at the time was traditionally hostile towards European computer manufacturers. By the end of 1985, it arrived in Europe and replaced the CPC664 in the CPC model line-up. Initial suggested retail prices for the CPC6128 were US$699.00/£299.00/DM1598.00 with a green screen and US$799.00/£399.00/DM2098.00 with a <b>colour</b> <b>monitor.</b>|$|E
40|$|CIE {{colorimetry}} {{was introduced}} 65 {{years ago to}} describe the colorimetric properties of coloured lights and signals. Soon after establishment {{it turned out that}} it is most capable to describe the colorimetry of reflective media and is now widely applied in all branches of the colouring industries (e. g. in the textile, paper and automotive industry), where the aim is to produce as far as possible non-metameric matches, i. e. matches where the standard and the test samples show similar spectral reflectance. With the advance of modern light sources (gas discharge lamps with and without phosphors, emitting in narrow emission bands) and the use of <b>colour</b> <b>monitors</b> it became important to deal with metameric matches (where only the colour is the same, but the spectral power distribution is very different) and to find ways to describe not only colour matches but also colour appearance.

50|$|Based on a LSI Logic RISC CPU {{running at}} 20 MHz, with a Weitek 3167 (or 3170) FPU {{coprocessor}} {{it was the}} fourth Sun computer (after the 4/260, 4/110 and 4/280) to use the SPARC architecture and the first of the sun4c architecture. The motherboard offered three SBus slots and had built-in AUI ethernet, 8 kHz audio, and a 5 MB/s SCSI-1 bus.

40|$|The Southampton Oceanographic Multi-Spectral Sensor (SOMSS) is an {{instrument}} for the measurement of underwater spectral radiance, irradiance, transmittance and scattering. The instrument uses multimode, step index, optical fibres to transmit radiation collected by the optical sensor heads to a central instrument body. Spectral measurements are carried out using a spectrograph which images input fibres from the sensors onto a full frame, two-dimensional CCD camera. The CCD camera and the internal light sources for transmittance and scattering measurements are operated by a PC compatible controller and the system has been designed for unattended operation. The use of fibre optic connectors to couple the optical sensors to the instrument allows the instrument to be reconfigured to meet a number of measurement requirements. The main design objective has been to provide spectral data with spectral resolutions approaching those expected {{for the next generation}} of remote sensing platforms for ocean <b>colour</b> <b>monitoring</b> such as SeaWIFS and MERIS. Dependent upon sensor type, spectral resolutions from 2 to 8 nanometres have been achieved over a spectral range from 400 to 700 nanometres. This instrument has been developed under a joint project between the Optoelectronics Research Centre and the Department of Oceanography, both at Southampton University, as part of the NERC funded Sensor and Instrument Design for Autosub and LOIS (SIDAL) project...|$|R

50|$|Oceansat-1 carried two payloads. The {{first of}} these, the Ocean <b>Colour</b> <b>Monitor</b> (OCM), {{is a solid}} state camera {{literally}} designed primarily to monitor the colour of the ocean, thereby useful for documenting chlorophyll concentration, phytoplankton blooms, atmospheric aerosols and particulate matter. It is capable of detecting eight spectrums ranging from 400 nm to 885 nm, all in the visible or near infrafred spectrums. The second, the Multi-frequency Scanning Microwave Radiometer (MSMR), collects data by measuring microwave radiation passing through the atmosphere over the ocean. This offers information including sea surface temperature, wind speed, cloud water content, and water vapour content.|$|E

40|$|Background Remote {{monitoring}} of mood disorders {{may be an}} effective and low resource option for patient follow-up, but relevant evidence remains very limited. This study explores real-life compliance and health services impacts of mood monitoring among patients with bipolar disorder in the UK. Methods Patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder who were registered users of the True <b>Colours</b> <b>monitoring</b> system for at least 12 months at study assessment were included in {{this retrospective cohort study}} (n = 79). Compliance was measured as the proportion of valid depression and mania scale messages received in comparison to their expected numbers over the first 12 months of monitoring. Mental health service use data were extracted from case notes, costed using national unit costs, and compared 12 months before (pre-TC period) and 12 months after (TC period) patients’ engagement with monitoring. Associations with relevant patient factors were investigated in a multiple regression model. Results Average compliance with monitoring was 82 %. Significant increases in the annual use and costs of psychiatrist contacts and total mental health services were shown for patients newly referred to the clinic during the pre-TC period but not for long-term patients of the clinic. Psychiatric medication costs increased significantly between the pre-TC and TC periods (£ 235, P = 0. 005) unrelated to patients’ referral status. Conclusions Remote mood monitoring has good compliance among consenting patients with bipolar disorder. We found no associations between observed changes in mental health service costs and the introduction of monitoring except for the increase in psychiatric medication costs. </p...|$|R
