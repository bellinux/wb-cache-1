30|$|Carbon steel coupon (20 mm× 10 mm× 2 mm) {{surfaces}} {{were treated}} using a sandblasting technique and were cleaned {{prior to the}} biofilm assay, as described previously (Nemati et al. 2001 b). Briefly, the coupons were cleaned in 18 % HCl, which was then neutralized by immersion in a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. Finally, coupons were washed with distilled water, rinsed in acetone, and dried in an air stream. Conditioned surfaces were obtained by immersion of carbon steel coupons in LEO at MIC, sub-MIC and supra-MIC solutions for 24 h at 20 °C. A cell control (without LEO) and a blank control (without cells) were performed using untreated <b>coupons.</b> Treated and <b>control</b> <b>coupons</b> were performed in 4 replicates. The remaining amount of LEO that was not absorbed to the metal surface was then removed by rinsing with deionised water and dried with sterile air. The cleaned coupons were placed in tubes containing Postgate C medium inoculated with 105 cells ml- 1 of D. alaskensis and incubated for 7 days. The effect of LEO was evaluated under macroscopic observations. In addition, to analyze coupon weight loss coupon surfaces were cleaned (washed in acid, neutralized with sodium bicarbonate, rinsed in water and acetone, and dried in an air stream) and coupon weight loss was determined by measuring {{the weight of the}} coupon using an analytical balance (Sartorius AG model TE 214 S, Goettingen, Germany) as previously described (Marques et al. 2012). Weight was measured in grams, and the corrosion rate (CR) of carbon steel coupons was calculated and is expressed in mm year- 1 (ASTM G 4 / 95 2001), using 7.84 g cm- 3 as the density of carbon steel. The average corrosion observed on blank coupons was subtracted from cell control (untreated) and conditioned coupons weight loss values. A two-sample t test was performed on treated and <b>control</b> <b>coupons.</b>|$|R
40|$|Biofilms {{comprise}} {{an assembly}} of microbial communities {{attached to a}} surface and enclosed in a polysaccharide matrix. Biofilms are a problem in dairy manufacturing plants where they cause biofouling of the stainless steel surface, resulting in product contamination {{and the need to}} shorten manufacturing runs for frequent cleaning. The equipment has to be thoroughly cleaned at regular intervals to remove biofilms. Clean-In-Place (CIP) procedures used in dairy manufacturing plants are not effective enough to remove all the biofilm cells as the extracellular polysaccharide (EPS), an integral part of a biofilm, reduces the penetration of cleaning agents. One possible alternative method to control biofilm growth involves surface modification of the stainless steel by implanting silver ions to prevent the attachment of viable bacteria that would otherwise form biofilms. Stainless steel coupons, implanted with 1 × 1016 silver ions per cm 2, and <b>control</b> stainless steel <b>coupons</b> were tested for the attachment of Streptococcus thermophilus and Pseudomonas fluorescens in various media for up to 30 minutes. Biofilm formation and EPS production for up to 24 hours was studied on the silver-implanted and <b>control</b> <b>coupons</b> in whole milk, skimmed milk and whey. It was found that there was higher attachment (0. 49 and 0. 18 log CFU per cm 2 of S. thermophilus and P. fluorescens, respectively) on the stainless steel coupons than on the silver-implanted coupons in saline. In the presence of milk and whey, the difference in the attachment of bacteria on the two coupons reduced. Biofilm studies showed that the number of bacteria colonising both types of coupons was not statistically significantly different (P > 0. 05). While the Live/Dead® BacLight™ Bacterial Viability stain showed that there were a few dead cells on the silver-implanted surfaces, scanning electron micrographs showed that the bacteria attached to a conditioning layer formed by the milk and whey proteins. Furthermore, both bacteria produced EPS, which, along with the conditioning film, might have masked the effect of silver ions from bacteria, resulting in similar numbers of bacteria present on the test and <b>control</b> <b>coupons.</b> Thus, due to the shielding effect of EPS and the conditioning film, the silver-implanted surfaces may be of limited practical value in the dairy industry...|$|R
40|$|Damage {{tolerant}} design, {{which focuses}} on a structure's ability to perform in a damaged state, is widely used in the aerospace industry today. Although extensive research {{has been carried out}} in this area for notched composite laminates, a relatively small fraction has dealt with compressive loading of composite honeycomb sandwich panels. Furthermore, little emphasis has been placed on identifying and modeling the damage mechanisms that contribute to ultimate failure. In an attempt to better understand the damage propagation and residual properties of notched composite panels subjected to compressive loads, edge-wise uniaxial quasi-static tests were performed in displacement <b>control.</b> <b>Coupons</b> consisted of various sized notched sandwich panels with woven Graphite-reinforced PMC facesheets and Nomex honeycomb cores.

40|$|A {{cooling tower}} is a heat removal device, which {{extracts}} waste heat {{to the atmosphere}} through the cooling of a water stream to a lower temperature. Cooling towers are frequently associated with biofilm problems and Legionnaires disease outbreaks. Where biofilms can cause clogging and corrosion, reduction of biofilms is important for operational reasons and public health. Therefore, effective anti-biofilm strategies are needed in practice. The aim {{of the present study}} was to reduce biofilm formation using a nano-hydrophobic coating on cooling tower fill materials – polypropylene cooling tower fill material was coated with nano-silica. The effectiveness of the hydrophobic coating was investigated for a 6 -month test period in a model cooling tower system, by monthly counting of the surface-associated bacteria using an epifluorescence microscope. A significant reduction (up to 4 log) in surface-associated bacteria was observed on coated test samples in comparison to uncoated <b>control</b> <b>coupons.</b> This study is the first report regarding the use of nano-silica coatings on cooling tower fills. The coating can be easily fabricated and the range of possible applications can be expanded to include a variety of conditions...|$|R

Participants (n = 2109) were referred by a health professional or lay communicator and randomly assigned to a coupon offer, referral reminder letter, or control group. A questionnaire was completed at screening, and a telephone interview was conducted 5 months later. RESULTS. Physician visit rates showed no professional or lay differences. For "no history" subjects, the behavioral interventions were effective compared with <b>controls</b> (<b>coupon</b> = 60. 7 % and reminder = 57. 7 % vs control = 46. 1 %). With professional counseling, only the coupon was effective; for lay counseling, both coupon and reminder yielded higher visit rates. Adjusted for sociodemographics, heart disease risk factors, and health perceptions, the intervention effects remained (professional-coupon offer: odds ratio [OR] = 1. 94, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 21, 3. 09; professional-reminder letter: OR = 1. 04, 95 % CI = 0. 67, 1. 63; lay-coupon offer: OR = 2. 52, 95 % CI = 1. 52, 4. 18; and lay-reminder letter: OR = 3. 10, 95 % CI = 1. 83, 5. 22).

40|$|The {{starboard}} solar alpha {{rotary joint}} (SARJ) race {{ring on the}} International space station (ISS) failed due to severe spalling of the outer diameter, 45 degree (outer canted) nitrided surface. Subsequent analysis at NASA-KSC revealed {{that almost all of}} the debris generated due to the failure was nitrided 15 - 5 stainless steel. Subsequent analysis of the nitride <b>control</b> <b>coupons</b> (NCC) at NASA-JSC revealed the presence of discontinuous inter-granular separations (DIGS) in the gas nitride layer. These DIGS were present in the inter-granular networking located in the top 2 mils of the nitride layer. The manufacturer's specification requires the maximum white structure to be 0. 0003 inches and intergranular networking below the allowable white structure depth to be cause for rejection; a requirement that the NCCs did not meet. Subsequent testing and analysis revealed that lower DIGS content significantly lowered the probability of nitride spalling in simulated, dry condition runs. One batch of nitride samples with DIGS content similar to the port SARJ (did not fail on orbit) which exhibited almost no nitride spalling after being run on one test rig. Another batch of nitride samples with DIGS content levels similar to the starboard SARJ exhibited significant nitride spalling on the same test rig with the same load under dry conditions. Although DIGS were not the root cause of starboard race ring failure, testing indicates that increased DIGS reduced the robustness of the gas nitride layer under dry operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of MoS{sub 2 } lubricants {{intended for the}} W 76 - 1 TSL was evaluated after 17 and 82 thermal cycles, each lasting seven days and including a low temperature of - 35 C and a high temperature of 93 C, in a sealed container containing organic materials. The MoS{sub 2 } was applied by tumbling with MoS{sub 2 } powder and steel pins (harperized), or by spraying with a resin binder (AS Mix). Surface composition measurements indicated an uptake of carbon and silicon on the lubricant surfaces after aging. Oxidation of the MoS{sub 2 } on harperized coupons, where enough MoS{sub 2 } {{was present at the}} surface to result in significant Mo and S concentrations, was found to be minimal for the thermal cycles in an atmosphere of primarily nitrogen. Bare steel surfaces showed a reduction in friction for exposed <b>coupons</b> compared to <b>control</b> <b>coupons</b> stored in nitrogen, at least for the initial cycles of sliding until the adsorbed contaminants were worn away. Lubricated surfaces showed no more than a ten percent increase in steady-state friction coefficient after exposure. Initial coefficient of friction was up to 250 percent higher than steady-state for AS Mix films on H 950 coupons after 82 thermal cycles. However, the friction coefficient exhibited by lubricated coupons was never greater than 0. 25, and more often less than 0. 15, even after the accelerated aging exposures...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the resistance of biofilms of Listeria monocytogenes to sanitizing agents under laboratory conditions simulating a food processing environment. Biofilms were initially formed on stainless steel and Teflon coupons using a five-strain mixture of L. monocytogenes. The coupons were then subjected to repeated 24 -h daily cycles. Each cycle consisted of three sequential steps: (i) a brief (60 s) exposure of the coupons to a sanitizing agent (a mixture of peroxides) or saline as a control treatment, (ii) storage of the coupons in sterile plastic tubes without any nutrients or water for 15 h, (iii) and incubation of the coupons in diluted growth medium for 8 h. This regimen was repeated daily for up to 3 weeks and was designed to represent stresses encountered by bacteria in a food processing environment. The bacteria on the coupons were reduced in number during the first week of the simulated food processing (SFP) regimen, but then adapted to the stressful conditions and increased in number. Biofilms repeatedly exposed the peroxide sanitizer in the SFP regimen developed resistance to the peroxide sanitizer as well as other sanitizers (quaternary ammonium compounds and chlorine). Interestingly, cells that were removed from the biofilms on peroxide-treated and <b>control</b> <b>coupons</b> were not significantly different in their resistance to sanitizing agents. These data suggest that the resistance of the treated biofilms to sanitizing agents may be due to attributes of extracellular polymeric substances and is not an intrinsic attribute of the cells in the biofilm...|$|R
40|$|Along {{with the}} growing demand for {{continuous}} fibre reinforced composite structures for future en-ergy efficient aircrafts and vehicles there is an emerging need for highly productive manufacturing strategies. The related high rate production processes {{will take advantage of}} a significantly in-creased level of automation to increase production speed and reproducibility. Looking at the proc-ess itself, {{it will be necessary to}} reduce infiltration and curing times to optimise process efficiency. Furthermore high rate production processes have to be absolutely mature to minimize quality con-trol efforts and scrap rates. Today the production processes for high performance CFRP compo-nents are restricted, because all crucial parameters like e. g. pressure, cure temperature, dwell time, heat-up and cool-down rates are specified and fixed. In order to meet the demands men-tioned above, a dynamic control of all crucial process parameter based on an online condition monitoring of all important laminate properties should be a viable option. A highly promising re-search approach in this respect is to analyse the laminate throughout the complete process via “Ultrasonic Sensors”. These sensors have to be compatible to the process conditions and the de-rived signal has to be mature enough to correct the process boundary conditions in the required way. Unlike the well known dielectric cure sensors not only the surface but the local volume of the laminate is measured by ultrasonic sensors. This in turn means, that not only resin flow fronts and the state of cure at the sensor surface can be measured but also volumetric conditions like local laminate thickness (important for open mould processes) integrated degree of cure over laminate thickness and possibly also void content can be analysed and utilised to optimise process parame-ters. Within the presentation the development status of ultrasonic online monitoring and the first successful applications e. g. in the field of dynamically <b>controlled</b> <b>coupon</b> panel manufacturing are shown...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addressed}} the antifouling efficiency of commercially available chlorine at different concentrations (0. 5 %, 1 % and 2 %) and exposure time (0. 5 min, 1 min, 5 min and 15 min). The rapid and non-destructive FIRe (fluorescence induction and relaxation) technique {{was used to}} evaluate the effects of the biocide on diatom dominated biofilms. The efficiency of chlorine in removing diatoms from the developed biofilms increased with an increase in concentration and exposure time. The fluorescence measurements revealed low Fv/Fm and high σPSII values for chlorine-treated Navicula and Amphora biofilms indicating that chlorination was efficient in damaging the photosystem-II reaction centers. Chlorination also caused mortality of diatom cells by damaging the cell body. In natural biofilms, the biocidal effect of chlorine was species specific; species of Amphiphrora, Navicula, Cylindrotheca and Coscinodiscus showed an increase in the density of the population, but species of Pleurosigma, Amphora and Thalassionema did not increase in density after chlorine treatment. It was also demonstrated that diatoms can colonize, grow and photosynthesize on chlorine treated surfaces. Under pulse chlorination (treatment every 6 h) irrespective of chlorine concentration, the development of biofouling decreased with an increase in exposure time. Differences between exposure times of 1 - 15 min were not significant. Additionally, transmission levels of the <b>control</b> (non-chlorine-treated) fouled <b>coupons</b> reduced significantly (~ 20 %) compared to the chlorine-treated fouled coupons (< 2 %).

40|$|The {{success in}} {{marketing}} original issue high-yield bonds has generated significant {{interest in their}} default experience. Studies comparing defaults to the par value of outstanding issues such as Altman (1987), Altman and Nammacher (1985), and Weinstein (1987) have found relatively low default rates. However, these studies understate default rates because of the rapid increase in the par value of outstanding issues and because cumulative default rates increase with years from issuance. Two recent studies by Altman (1989) and Asquith, Mullins and Wolff (AMW) (1989) have corrected these problems by using aging analysis to follow rated nonconvertible high-yield bonds over time; they find cumulative default rates for such bonds 10 years after issuance exceeding 30 percent.; This study extends the literature on high-yield default rates to convertible and nonrated securities, not examined in previous studies. The high-yield market can be partitioned into rated nonconvertible, rated convertible, nonrated nonconvertible, and nonrated convertible securities. Other things equal, one would expect higher default risk {{to be associated with}} higher yields; however, other things are not equal. For example, securities may have high yields because of differences in liquidity or differences in conversion options. Therefore, yields reflect more than just expected default risk; they also incorporate premiums for other characteristics of individual securities.; When the securities are partitioned by rating and convertibility, the results of this paper show that the cumulative default rates are lower for rated convertible securities than for rated nonconvertible securities. Because investors value convertibility, convertible bonds carry substantially lower coupon rates than nonconvertible bonds. These lower coupon rates may reduce the likelihood of an issue defaulting.; In addition, this study examines nonrated securities. Many securities are nonrated because the graduated fee structure charged by rating agencies makes ratings prohibitively expensive for smaller issues. Despite some potential biases that are discussed below, the default rate on nonrated convertible bonds is significantly less than that of rated nonconvertible securities, and the default rate on nonrated nonconvertible bonds appears to be less than that for rated nonconvertible securities.; The next section of the paper discusses the data and shows that the default rates for rated nonconvertible securities are higher than those for rated convertible, nonrated convertible, and nonrated nonconvertible securities. Each category of security is further examined for explanations for lower default rates, in Sections II through IV. Section V estimates a logit model that shows that default differences based on security characteristics persist even after <b>controlling</b> for <b>coupon</b> rates and size. Section VI summarizes the results. Bonds; Corporate bonds...|$|R
