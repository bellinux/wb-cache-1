40|$|Objectives: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} if vitamin B 6 therapy would reverse linezolid-associated <b>cytopenias</b> and/or peripheral neuropathy. Patients and methods: We have recently treated two patients with disseminated Mycobacterium abscessus infections with prolonged (>_ 9 month) courses of linezolid. Both patients developed <b>cytopenias</b> related to linezolid, and one patient also developed peripheral neuropathy. Because continuing linezolid therapy was required, we administered vitamin B 6 (50 mg orally once a day) {{in an attempt to}} mitigate the associated <b>cytopenias.</b> Results: The <b>cytopenias</b> in both patients reversed following administration of vitamin B 6, and stabilized during prolonged linezolid therapy, although the peripheral neuropathy did not. Conclusions: Vitamin B 6 treatment may be useful to prevent or modify the course of linezolidassociated <b>cytopenias.</b> More formal and rigorous study of vitamin B 6 therapy in patients receiving prolonged courses of linezolid is warranted...|$|R

Unlike most of the self limiting autoimmune <b>cytopenias</b> sporadically seen in childhood, multi lineage <b>cytopenias</b> due to ALPS are often refractory as their inherited genetic defect {{is not going to}} go away. Historically more ALPS patients have died due to overwhelming sepsis following splenectomy to manage their chronic <b>cytopenias</b> than due to any other cause, including malignancies. Hence current recommendations underscore the importance of avoiding splenectomy in ALPS, by long-term use of corticosteroid sparing immunosuppressive agents like mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus.

40|$|Background]: Posttransplant <b>cytopenias</b> are {{a severe}} {{complication}} after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and their origin is often multifactorial or unknown. They are frequently refractory to standard therapy, which may include steroids and/or immunoglobulins. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are an attractive therapeutic {{tool in the}} allo-SCT setting for the ability to enhance engraftment as well as acting as immunosuppressants for graft-versus-host disease. There is no prior experience {{in the literature of}} the use of MSCs to treat <b>cytopenias</b> after allo-SCT. [Case Reports]: In this work we report for the first time four cases of refractory posttransplant <b>cytopenias</b> (three patients with thrombocytopenia and one with neutropenia) that were treated with MSCs from a third-party donor. MSCs were expanded from 100 mL of marrow obtained under standard good manufacturing practice conditions. Most patients received more than one cell dose, and median dose of MSCs administered was 1 Ã— 10 6 /kg. [Results]: All patients recovered normal blood counts, with a mean follow-up of 12. 5 months. There were no adverse events related to MSC administration. [Conclusion]: MSC therapy may contribute to the recovery of refractory posttransplant peripheral <b>cytopenias</b> in patients undergoing allo-SCT. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Background : Until recently, {{recommendations}} for HCV treatment in HIV-coinfected patients have been combination therapy with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV). However, this treatment is often accompanied with <b>cytopenias</b> {{which lead to}} drug-dose reduction/discontinuation, therefore influencing sustained virological response (SVR). This study aimed at evaluating incidence and predictors of <b>cytopenias</b> and to define their impact on SVR in Italian HIVâ€“HCV-coinfected patients undergoing PEG-IFN/RBV treatment. Methods : OPERA was a multicentric, observational study conducted in 98 Italian centres. Patients with HIVâ€“HCV coinfection were administered with PEG-IFN/RBV combination treatment for 48 weeks. Incidence and time of onset of <b>cytopenias</b> and multiple bone marrow toxicity (mBMT) was monitored. Logistic regression analysis assessed factors associated with SVR, anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and mBMT. Results : Between 2005 and 2011, 1, 523 patients were enrolled.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of hematologic disorders after solid organ transplantation (SOT) {{must take into}} account issues unique to the post-transplant setting that influence the development of anemia and single or multi-lineage <b>cytopenias.</b> Attention to the time of onset of <b>cytopenia(s)</b> is important, because the disorders of passenger lymphocyte syndrome, transplant-related thrombotic microangiopathy, hemophagocytic syndrome, and graft-versus-host disease typically occur during the first few months after SOT, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder usually occurs within the first year. Drug-related anemia and <b>cytopenia(s)</b> occur due to a variety of mechanisms, including drug-induced hemolysis and marrow suppression and perturbation of T-cell subsets by the immunosuppressive agents, leading to immune dysregulation and autoimmunity. Viral infections can cause direct suppression of hematopoiesis, and a variety of opportunistic infections can precipitate acquired hemophagocytic syndrome, a frequently lethal systemic inflamma-tory disorder. Early investigation of pancytopenia by bone marrow biopsy is warranted, because it is often the presenting symptom of one or multiple life-threatening pathologies after SOT, such as graft-versus host disease, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, hemophagocytic syndrome, or severe opportunistic infections, and these entities may have a better prognosis if early interventions are undertaken.

This disease is characteristic with its symptoms as persistent infections of the skin, mucosae - oral or genital and nails infections caused by Candida, mostly Candida albicans. CMC may very often result from primary immunodeficiency. Patients with CMC often suffer also with bacterial infections (mostly Staphylococcus aureus), also with infections of the respiratory system and skin. In these patients we can also find viral infections caused mostly by Herpesviridae, that also affect the skin. The mycobacterial infections are often caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis or environmental bacteria. Very common are also autoimmune symptoms like type 1 diabetes, <b>cytopenia,</b> regression of the thymus or systemic lupus erythematosus. When T-cell deficient, these autoimmune dÃ­seases are very common. CMC was also reported as a common symptom in patients with hyper immunoglobulin E syndrom (hyper-IgE) and with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I. There was reported an interleukin 17A role, because of low levels of IL-17A producing T-cells in CMC patients.|$|E

One hundred and twenty-five patients were treated with a median of six hyper-CVAD cycles and followed for a median of 28 months. Follow-up for <b>cytopenias</b> was censored at the next cytotoxic therapy. At 3 months post-therapy, 77 patients were evaluable. <b>Cytopenias</b> persisted in 59 % of patients.
