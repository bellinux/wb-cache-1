40|$|A {{description}} of the condensation heat transfer process in microgravity is given. A {{review of the literature}} is also reported. The most essential element of condensation heat transfer in microgravity is the <b>condensate</b> <b>removal</b> mechanism. Two mechanisms for <b>condensate</b> <b>removal</b> are analyzed by looking into two problems. The first problem is concerned with film condensation on a flat porous plate with the condensate being removed by suction at the wall. The second problem is an analytical prediction of the heat transfer coefficient for condensing annular flows with the condensate film driven by the vapor shear. It is concluded that both suction and vapor shear can effectively drain the condensate to ensure continuous operation of the condensers operated under a microgravity environment. It is recommended that zero-g flight experiments be carried out to verify the prediction made in the present report. The results contained in this report should also aid in the design of future space condensers...|$|E
40|$|The alumina {{refining}} industry {{is one of}} a number of global industries that produce process waters containing mercury. The research program detailed in this dissertation focuses on processes for removing mercury from Bayer digestion condensate streams. Bayer refinery digestion condensate is chemically unique because it exhibits high pH and is chemically reducing, thermodynamically favouring the presence of elemental mercury. The temperature of condensate is typically 95 oC, with flow rates up to 490 kL/hour. On the basis of these unique conditions, a literature review of mercury removal processes was conducted. Of the many processes reviewed, three broad process options were selected for further examination. These were: &bull; Adsorption onto activated carbon or other suitable materials &bull; Sparging mercury into a gas stream &bull; Complexation or amalgamation onto modified silica substrates using noble metals or sulphur functional groups as impregnates A variety of activated carbon types were tested using batch, up-flow column or filtration tests. These carbon types included a granular virgin activated carbon (VAC); granular and extrudate sulphur impregnated activated carbon (SIAC); an extruded silver impregnated activated carbon (AgAC) and a combination of two powdered virgin activated carbons (PAC). The adsorption mechanism for both the VAC and the SIACs was physical and as such the mercury capacity of the carbon was determined to be a function of the concentration of mercury in solution. The sulphur impregnated into the SIAC did not increase the mercury capacity because of sulphur dissolution into the <b>condensate.</b> The <b>removal</b> efficiency and mercury loading demonstrated by these carbon types was poor and did not justify further investigation. This was primarily because the adsorption and chemisorption processes were interfered with by the digestion condensate matrix. The PACs were tested in batch mode and were also incorporated into a filter bed, through which condensate was passed. The PACs demonstrated a superior mercury loading and a higher removal efficiency compared to the VAC and SIACs. The volume of condensate required to achieve mercury breakthrough was not determined and it is recommended that further tests be conducted to determine this. In addition to the high removal efficiency demonstrated by the PACs, the short residence times of &lt; 30 seconds associated with the filtration procedure, justifies further investigation as a mercury removal process option. The AgAC demonstrated the highest mercury loading of the granular and extruded carbon types. This may be attributed to the chemisorption or amalgamation of elemental mercury and it is recommended that mercury removal via amalgamation be investigated using a high surface area form of suitable metals such as silver and tin. A sulphur impregnated silicate material was also tested using batch and up-flow column tests. As was the case for the SIACs, the impregnated silicate material suffered from sulphur dissolution in the condensate. This material is therefore not recommended for further investigation. Each of the impregnated mesoporous silica based materials, except for the gold impregnated silica, demonstrated poor stability in condensate and should not be considered for further assessment or implementation. Although the gold impregnated silica was stable, and demonstrated effective mercury removal, it would be too expensive to justify for use on an industrial scale unless a process for regenerating the gold was developed. It did, however, further demonstrate the opportunity for tests involving mercury amalgamation. 3 Gas sparging was the most viable opportunity with ~ 80 % mercury removal demonstrated. The system involves steam sparging to volatilise mercury from the solution phase to a vapour phase, from which the mercury is compressed and re-condensed for collection. It was estimated that the system would cost approximately 4 million dollars to install with annual operating costs of approximately $ 500 000...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{samples of}} air {{were taken in}} 122 shops with the split air {{conditioning}} systems. The unfavorable changes of air quality were detected after switching of air-conditioning systems. Before switching of the air-conditioning systems, the provisionally pathogenic and pathogenic bacteria in the air were presented in 6. 4 % of samples, the mould fungi — in 27. 8 %, the yeast fungi — in 5. 7 %. After 30 minutes of split-systems operation, the provisionally pathogenic and pathogenic bacteria were found in 97. 5 % samples, mould fungi — in 72. 1 % and the yeast fungi — in 27. 9 %. Moreover, the species diversity of microorganisms in indoor air, after switching of split-system, was fully corresponded (100 %) to the microflora of biofilms in internal block of the split-systems.

40|$|Handling {{of water}} {{accumulation}} {{is still a}} key issue in fuel cell research. The presented study evaluates the <b>condensate</b> <b>removal</b> capability of three different flow field designs. The designs are compared regarding cell voltage at different current densities using the same operating conditions. The investigated type of meander shaped channels {{with a high degree}} of parallelization shows the best performance with stationary water thickness inside channels throughout the analyzed current densities. To develop and evaluate a <b>condensate</b> <b>removal</b> criterion for fuel cell construction, the pressure drop of each flow field is correlated to the water appearance visualized with neutron radiography. For a further insight, computational fluid dynamics simulation is used to calculate pressure drops present inside the characteristic regions of each flow field. Thus, a characteristic design limit of 20 mbar m 1 for meander shaped channels is proven to ensure the absence of channel blockage. The meander shaped channels show specific pressure drops around this limit depending on water production and gas supply. The two other analyzed flow fields suffer from higher channel filling rates the investigated straight channels with less parallelization fill up with time, while the pattern structured flow field demonstrates gravity as an additional influence on condensate remova...|$|E

The dropwise condensation process is frequently interrupted upon which nucleation restarts each time. Non-artificial drainage occurs at low frequencies of typically 4 large drops per second per dm^ 2. <b>Condensate</b> <b>removal</b> {{at such a}} frequency that does not allow formation of large drops artificially makes the initial phase of drop growth more important.

Recent engineering developments show that steam traps can be eliminated.

40|$|Enhancing {{condensation}} heat transfer {{is important for}} broad applications from power generation to water harvesting systems. Significant efforts have focused on easy removal of the condensate, yet the other desired properties of low contact angles and high nucleation densities for high heat transfer performance have been typically neglected. In this work, we demonstrate immersion condensation on oil-infused micro and nanostructured surfaces with heterogeneous coatings, where water droplets nucleate immersed within the oil. The combination of surface energy heterogeneity, reduced oil-water interfacial energy, and surface structuring enabled drastically increased nucleation densities while maintaining easy <b>condensate</b> <b>removal</b> and low contact angles. Accordingly, on oil-infused heterogeneous nanostructured copper oxide surfaces, we demonstrated approximately 100 % increase in heat transfer coefficient compared to state-of-the-art dropwise condensation surfaces {{in the presence of}} non-condensable gases. This work offers a distinct approach utilizing surface chemistry and structuring together with liquid-infusion for enhanced {{condensation heat}} transfer. PUBLISHEDpeer-reviewe...|$|E
3000|$|Wire mesh, vane {{type and}} {{cyclonic}} separators are standard as mist extractors {{for the small}} liquid droplets that are not separated by gravity in {{the main body of}} the separator (Gas Processors Suppliers Association 2004). These cyclones are used for water and <b>condensate</b> <b>removal</b> but have not been applied for removing condensed contaminants, such as CO_ 2 or H_ 2 S. [...] This is because cyclones can only handle condensing droplet sizes above 10  μm (Gas Processors Suppliers Association 2004; Clift 1997; Svarovsky 1984). To achieve such droplet, sizes requires unrealistically large droplet growth pipes. It is well known in laboratory chemical applications that microcyclones can separate micron-sized droplets having diameters as small as 1 μm, but then the flow is very small and orders of magnitude less than the flow in gas well applications. Alternatively, one can improve separation efficiency by increasing swirl velocity to supersonic velocity but at the costs of large pressure drops (Schinkelshoek et al. 2008).|$|E
40|$|A {{two-stage}} {{procedure for}} pretreatment of fast-growing willow with steam has been investigated. The first stage was performed at {{temperatures in the}} range 180 °C to 220 °C for times between 6 and 10 minutes while the second stage was performed at 220 °C for 10 minutes. The fibrous material was washed between the two stages to remove the pentosans and thus increase the pentose yield. The pretreatment was assessed in terms of glucose yield and xylose yield in the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. The maximum yields, around 70 % for both glucose and xylose, were obtained for a pretreatment temperature of 200 °C in the first stage. The {{major part of the}} xylose was found in the first rinsing water while almost all the glucose was recovered from the final fibrous material. The glucose yield was increased to above 80 % when wet material (30 % ODM) was used in the first stage. This required a modification of the steam pretreatment unit, allowing for <b>condensate</b> <b>removal</b> during steaming.

40|$|Color {{images of}} steady state water vapor {{condensing}} on smooth and nanostructured hydrophobic surfaces are presented. Figure 1 a shows {{a snapshot of}} classical filmwise condensation on hydrophilic copper. A thin liquid film forms on the high surface energy substrate and acts as a conduction barrier for heat transfer. Figure 1 b shows dropwise condensation on a copper tube made hydrophobic via deposition of a tri-chloro silane (TFTS). Discrete droplets form on the surface and, upon reaching a size comparable to the capillary length (≈ 2. 7 mm), depart from the surface by gravitational sweeping. Figure 1 c shows jumping-droplet condensation on a nanostructured superhydrophobic copper oxide (CuO) surface. When droplets coalesce on this surface, the resulting droplet can jump due {{to the release of}} excess surface energy (Figure 2 b), and as a result, rapid droplet jumping is observed at micrometric length scales (R < 20 μm). Figure 1 d shows a novel mode of condensation called ‘immersion’ condensation, where nucleation density is drastically increased while maintaining easy <b>condensate</b> <b>removal</b> (R < 500 μm) and low contact angles (< 120 ˚). This approach utilizes an oil-infused nanostructured CuO surface with a heterogeneous coating which allows droplets to nucleate immersed within the oil (Figure 2 c). The increase in nucleation density is achieved due to the combined effect of surface energy heterogeneity and a reduced oil-water interfacial energy. Figure 2 a shows a schematic of the experimental setup. The visualizations provide insight into the complex droplet-surface interactions, which are important for the development of enhanced phase change surfaces. If designed properly, these surfaces not only allow for easy droplet removal at micrometric length scales during condensation but also promise to enhance heat transfer performance...|$|E
40|$|Space Station Freedom (SSF) {{presents}} {{the opportunity to}} perform long term fluid and thermal experiments in a microgravity environment. This presentation provides perspective {{on the need for}} fluids/thermal experimentation in a microgravity environment, addresses previous efforts, identifies possible experiments, and discusses the capabilities of a proposed fluid physics/dynamics test facility. Numerous spacecraft systems use fluids for their operation. Thermal control, propulsion, waste management, and various operational processes are examples of such systems. However, effective ground testing is very difficult. This is because the effect of gravity induced phenomena, such as hydrostatic pressure, buoyant convection, and stratification, overcome such forces as surface tension, diffusion, electric potential, etc., which normally dominate in a microgravity environment. Hence, space experimentation is necessary to develop and validate a new fluid based technology. Two broad types of experiments may be performed on SSF: basic research and applied research. Basic research might include experiments focusing on capillary phenomena (with or without thermal and/or solutal gradients), thermal/solutal convection, phase transitions, and multiphase flow. Representative examples of applied research might include two-phase pressure drop, two-phase flow instabilities, heat transfer coefficients, fluid tank fill/drain, tank slosh dynamics, <b>condensate</b> <b>removal</b> enhancement, and void formation within thermal energy storage materials. In order to better support such fluid/thermal experiments on board SSF, OSSA has developed a conceptual design for a proposed Fluid Physics/Dynamics Facility (FP/DF). The proposed facility consists of one facility rack permanently located on SSF and one experimenter rack which is changed out as needed to support specific experiments. This approach will minimize the on-board integration/deintegration required for specific experiments. The FP/DF will have acceleration/vibration compensation, power and thermal interfaces, computer command/data collection, a video imaging system, and a portable glove box for operations. This facility will allow real-time astronaut interaction with the testing...|$|E
40|$|Polyesters and {{polyamides}} are commercially important polymers {{prepared by}} polycondensation. The conventional solution to melt polymerization techniques {{stop at a}} low or medium molecular weight product, due to problems arising from severe increase of the melt viscosity and operating temperatures. Higher molecular weights may be reached by Solid State Polymerization (SSP) at temperatures between the glass transition and the onset of melting. Polycondensation progresses through chain end reactions in the amorphous phase of the semicrystalline polymer, which in most cases {{is in the form}} of flakes (mean diameter > 1. 0 mm) or powder (mean diameter < 100 mum); reaction by-products are removed by application of vacuum or through convection caused by passing an inert gas. The advantages of SSP include low operating temperatures, which restrain side reactions and thermal degradation of the product, while requiring inexpensive equipment, and uncomplicated and environmentally sound procedures. Disadvantages of SSP focus on low reaction rates, compared to melt phase polymerization, and possible solid particle processability problems arising from sintering. The review begins with a theoretical background regarding SSP, the fundamentals of techniques and equipment, including the use of inert gas in reactive systems. Further, it is explained how SSP progress involves both chemical and physical steps, since it is controlled by reaction kinetics, reactive chain-end mobility in the amorphous phase, and <b>condensate</b> <b>removal</b> through diffusion. The reaction temperature emerges as the most important parameter of SSP rate variation, due to its interaction with all aspects of the process. High prepolymer molecular weight affects positively the SSP rate, since it is accompanied by elevated degrees of crystallinity; this implies more effective confinement of the amorphous phase and, therefore high concentration and homogeneous distribution of reactive chain ends in the non-crystalline regions. Similarly, refinement in reacting particle size distribution and morphology, in conjunction with high gas flow rates, increases the interfacial area per unit volume and the effectiveness of convective by-product elimination. Finally, the SSP rate increases principally by the use of phosphorous catalysts, which also reduce agglomeration. In the following sections of this review, emphasis is on the progress in experimentally determining the intrinsic rate constants of principal relevant chemical reactions. The corresponding kinetic models are either based on the Flory theory, where the rate expressions are in terms of end-group concentrations, or on a power-law description of the rate with respect to reaction time. Recent advances in modeling and large scale simulation of the various physical and chemical processes occurring within a SSP reactor are reported. The goal is to describe the dynamic evolution of all chemical species within the particle and its surroundings, and assess its dependence on basic process variables. Finally, special focus is given on methods of manipulating the molecular weight distribution of the SSP product, by varying prepolymer particle size distribution, initial stoichiometry and condensate content in the surroundings.
