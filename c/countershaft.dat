2500|$|Scott's first {{experiments}} with a two-stroke {{were in a}} motor boat, where {{he was able to}} make tests and obtain 'diagrams' under working conditions. His first attempt at a motor cycle was fitting an engine of his own design to a Premier bicycle in 1901. This twin cylinder engine had steel cylinders with shrunk on aluminium radiator 'flanges', and drove the front wheel via friction directly to the tyre. He described the drive system as 'useless in the wet', and he could not prevent the cylinders from scoring. His next engine had cast iron cylinders of 2 1/4" [...] bore, and eventually drove by belt to clutch <b>countershaft</b> and then by chain to the rear wheel. Various ingenious ignition arrangements were used including link work driven by a pin placed mid-way on the connecting rod. In parallel to this he continued work on a 4" [...] bore, 4" [...] stroke marine engine which developed 10HP at 800rpm, fitted with a large water-cooled brake wheel (a dynamometer). By recording brake and indicator readings he was able to experiment with port shapes and piston shapes, developing the 'curved top' (deflector) piston.|$|E
50|$|Like other {{transmission}}s, {{a manual}} transmission has several shafts with various gears and other components attached to them. Typically, a rear-wheel-drive transmission has three shafts: an input shaft, a <b>countershaft</b> and an output shaft. The <b>countershaft</b> {{is sometimes called}} a layshaft.|$|E
50|$|Under one {{possible}} design, the transmission's input shaft has just one pinion gear, which drives the <b>countershaft.</b> Along the <b>countershaft</b> are mounted gears of various sizes, which rotate when the input shaft rotates. These gears {{correspond to the}} forward speeds and reverse. Each of the forward gears on the <b>countershaft</b> is permanently meshed with a corresponding gear on the output shaft. However, these driven gears are not rigidly attached to the output shaft: although the shaft runs through them, they spin independently of it, which is made possible by bearings in their hubs. Reverse is typically implemented differently; see the section on Reverse.|$|E
50|$|Modern jackshafts and <b>countershafts</b> {{are often}} hidden inside large {{machinery}} as {{components of the}} larger overall device.|$|R
50|$|There are two semi-elliptic springs on each axle. The {{back axle}} is located {{by a pair}} of {{distance}} rods fixed to the main frame by the same brackets as the final drive and gearbox. Used to tension the chains they are free to swing about the same centre but place no strain on the <b>countershaft's</b> bearings.|$|R

5000|$|Distance {{between the}} {{centerline}} of the mainshaft and the <b>countershaft</b> is 85mm.|$|E
50|$|In some {{transmission}} designs (Volvo 850 and V/S70 series, for example) {{there are}} actually two countershafts, both driving an output pinion meshing with the front-wheel-drive transaxle's ring gear. This allows the transmission designer to make the transmission narrower, since each <b>countershaft</b> need only be half {{as long as a}} traditional <b>countershaft</b> with four gears and two shifters.|$|E
5000|$|Truck {{transmissions}} use many physical layouts. For example, {{the output}} of an N-speed transmission may drive an M-speed secondary transmission, giving a total of N*M gear combinations; for example a 4-speed main box and 3-speed splitter gives 12 ratios. Transmissions may be in separate cases with a shaft in between; in separate cases bolted together; or all in one case, using the same lubricating oil. The second transmission is often called a [...] "Brownie" [...] or [...] "Brownie box" [...] after a popular brand. With a third transmission, gears are multiplied yet again, giving greater range or closer spacing. Some trucks thus have dozens of gear positions, although most are duplicates. Sometimes a secondary transmission is integrated with the differential in the rear axle, called a [...] "two-speed rear end". Two-speed differentials are always splitters. In newer transmissions, there may be two <b>countershafts,</b> so each main shaft gear can be driven from {{one or the other}} countershaft; this allows construction with short and robust <b>countershafts,</b> while still allowing many gear combinations inside a single gear case.|$|R
50|$|Because the {{flywheels}} are {{a mechanical}} power source, {{it is not}} necessary to use an electric motor or generator as an intermediary between it and a diesel engine designed to provide emergency power. By using a transmission gearbox, the rotational inertia of the flywheel can be used to directly start up a diesel engine, and once running, the diesel engine can be used to directly spin the flywheel. Multiple flywheels can likewise be connected in parallel through mechanical <b>countershafts,</b> without the need for separate motors and generators for each flywheel.|$|R
500|$|Examples of {{the agency}} {{agreements}} in place can be found from in the American Machinist of June 1897. They include: the Hamilton Machine Tool Company of Ohio (who were advertising a 16" [...] sliding head drill); Baker Bros of Toledo, Ohio (advertising a combined sprocket turning and boring machine); Flather & Co, Nashua, N.H. (lathes); Warner & Swasey, Cleveland, Ohio (turret engine lathes); Chas. A. Strelinger & Co, Detroit (grinding and polishing machinery and pull <b>countershafts</b> by Builders' Iron Foundry, Providence, R.I.); and American Gas Furnace Co, New York (oil gas plants, gas blast furnaces and high pressure blowers). He had {{much to say about}} the correct manner of packing all of this equipment.|$|R
5000|$|The term <b>countershaft</b> is {{somewhat}} older. In 1828, {{the term was}} {{used to refer to}} an intermediate horizontal shaft in a gristmill driven through gearing by the waterwheel and driving the millstones through bevel gears. [...] An 1841 textbook used the term to refer to a short shaft driven by a belt from the line shaft and driving the spindle of a lathe through additional belts. The <b>countershaft</b> and the lathe spindle each carried cones of different-diameter pulleys for speed control. [...] In 1872, this definition was given: [...] "The term <b>countershaft</b> is applied to all shafts driven from the main line [...] when placed at or near the machines to be driven ..." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{transverse}} casing of the <b>countershaft</b> {{the differential}} and the gearbox is of aluminium alloy and it covers the entire transmission gear. The change-speed lever {{is mounted on}} this casing. The transmission has eight ring-lubricator type bearings fed by pipes from feeders with gauge glasses visible from beneath the car. Power is transmitted from the transverse <b>countershaft</b> to each rear wheel by 1Â½ inch pitch roller chains. When necessary the complete gearbox may be removed downwards.|$|E
50|$|The gear {{selector}} does not engage or disengage the actual gear teeth which are permanently meshed. Rather, {{the action of}} the {{gear selector}} is to lock one of the freely spinning gears to the shaft that runs through its hub. The shaft then spins together with that gear. The output shaft's speed relative to the <b>countershaft</b> is determined by the ratio of the two gears: the one permanently attached to the <b>countershaft,</b> and that gear's mate which is now locked to the output shaft.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{energy and}} {{resource}} efficient manufacture of consumption and investment products {{is becoming a}} competitive advantage and companies are increasingly interested in optimal manufacturing chain design and process operation. Based on the discrete events modeling approach empirically parameterized process models for heating, hot-rolling, forging and turning are combined to two alternative manufacturing chains for the manufacture of <b>countershafts.</b> The discrete events also consider specific NC codes (e. g. for turning) and allow for time-depended consumption profile calculations. Further defining and structuring all parameters of the manufacturing chains with all their processes in so-called system entity structures provides {{the basis for a}} numerical optimization by artificial intelligence tools. A genetic algorithm in combination with a fitness function has been employed to find the manufacturing chain design and process parameter set with the lowest energy and resource consumption for the manufacture of the shafts in an effective way...|$|R

50|$|Accommodating {{the longer}} {{swingarm}} {{was another reason}} the CBR1000RR power plant shared nothing with the 954. Shortening the engine compared to the 954 meant rejecting the conventional in-line layout. Instead, engineers positioned the CBR1000RR's crankshaft, main shaft and <b>countershaft</b> in a triangulated configuration, with the <b>countershaft</b> located below the main shaft, dramatically shortening the engine front to back, and moving the swingarm pivot closer to the crankshaft. This configuration was first successfully introduced by Yamaha with the YZF-R1 model in 1998 and inspired superbike design in the following years.|$|E
50|$|On a {{conventional}} rear-drive transmission, {{there are three}} basic shafts; the input, the output, and the <b>countershaft.</b> The input and output together are called the mainshaft, since they are joined inside the transmission so {{they appear to be}} a single shaft, although they rotate totally independently of each other. The input length of this shaft is much shorter than the output shaft. Parallel to the mainshaft is the <b>countershaft.</b> There are a number of gears fixed along the <b>countershaft,</b> and matching gears along the output shaft, although these are not fixed, and rotate independently of the output shaft. There are sliding dog collars, or dog clutches, between the gears on the output shaft, and to engage a gear to the shaft, the collar slides into the space between the shaft and the inside space of the gear, thus rotating the shaft as well. One collar is usually mounted between two gears, and slides both ways to engage one or the other gears, so on a four-speed there would be two collars. A front-drive transmission is basically the same, but may be simplified. There often are two shafts, the input and the output, but depending on the direction of rotation of the engine, three may be required. Rather than the input shaft driving the <b>countershaft</b> with a pinion gear, the input shaft takes over the countershaft's job, and the output shaft runs parallel to it. The gears are positioned and engaged just as they are on the <b>countershaft</b> and output shaft of a rear-drive. This merely eliminates one major component, the pinion gear. Part of the reason that the input and output are in-line on a rear drive unit is to relieve torsional stress on the transmission and mountings, but this isn't an issue in a front-drive as the gearbox is integrated into the transaxle.|$|E
50|$|The car {{was unusual}} in having the {{air-cooled}} engine mounted outside the {{body on the}} front right hand side The first cars had a basic 2 seater body with the seats side by side and 4 hp single-cylinder, four-stroke JAP engine. Subsequent cars had a variety of engines, some with two cylinders. The engine drove a <b>countershaft</b> mounted across the car. From this two forward gears were provided by belts to either of the rear wheels with ratios selected by clutches on different diameter pulleys on {{either end of the}} <b>countershaft.</b> Braking was by blocks bearing on the drive pulleys.|$|E
50|$|The Hill & Stanier was an English automobile, a six-horsepower cyclecar with a V twin, {{air-cooled}} engine. Drive was to {{the rear}} wheels by belt to a <b>countershaft</b> and then by chain to the wheels.|$|E
50|$|In large ships, an {{emergency}} stop button pulls the <b>countershaft</b> for the fuel pumps to the stop position, cutting off the fuel supply and stopping the engines. With a controllable-pitch propeller, the stop button may declutch the engine from the propeller.|$|E
50|$|Many {{transmissions}} and {{gears used}} in automotive and truck applications {{are contained in}} a cast iron case, though more frequently aluminium is used for lower weight especially in cars. There are usually three shafts: a mainshaft, a <b>countershaft,</b> and an idler shaft.|$|E
50|$|In many {{transmissions}} {{the input}} and output components of the mainshaft can be locked {{together to create a}} 1:1 gear ratio, causing the power flow to bypass the <b>countershaft.</b> The mainshaft then behaves like a single, solid shaft: a situation referred to as direct drive.|$|E
50|$|An {{exhaust box}} {{is mounted on}} the near (left) side between the <b>countershaft</b> and the back axle. After passing through this box the gases are led {{across the back of}} the car in a pipe with a {{perforated}} underside to minimise the dust stirred up.|$|E
50|$|This {{new design}} {{departed}} from the previous approach of building electric locomotives with a slow running, large motor and went for four smaller electric motors. The drive was {{divided into two groups}} within a single frame. Each group had two motors, that drove a common <b>countershaft</b> using cogs. The <b>countershaft</b> drove a jackshaft via inclined driving rods which was coupled to two driving axles with coupling rods. In order to ensure that the permitted axle load was not exceeded the engines were given a leading and trailing bogie. The locomotive body with its two driver's cabs was built on the frame. The vehicle components were manufactured by Maffei and the electrical equipment by WASSEG, a joint venture of AEG and SSW.|$|E
5000|$|The car was {{powered by}} an 8 hp JAP V-twin engine. This was coupled to a <b>countershaft</b> by a rubber belt. Different [...] "gear" [...] ratios were {{available}} {{by moving the}} position of the belt with final drive by a further belt to the right hand rear wheel.|$|E
50|$|Front-wheel and rear-wheel-drive {{transmissions}} operate similarly. When {{the transmission}} {{is put in}} neutral and the clutch is disengaged, the input shaft, clutch disk and <b>countershaft</b> can continue to rotate under their own inertia. In this state, the engine, the input shaft and clutch, and the output shaft all rotate independently.|$|E
50|$|The 1078 cc, air-cooled, Precision V {{twin engine}} with RAC rating of 9 hp was coupled to a {{friction}} drive which gave a varying drive ratio {{by moving the}} driven wheel along a cone. This then used bevel gerars to connect to a <b>countershaft</b> and thence to the rear wheels by a belt.|$|E
50|$|The Burney {{engine was}} a side-valve of 81mm bore and 96mm stroke, with an {{external}} 11 inch flywheel. Transmission was by a three speed Sturmey-Archer <b>countershaft</b> gearbox with kick starter. It {{had a hand}} controlled clutch, and all chain transmission. It had aluminium guards over {{the front and rear}} chain and an aluminium silencer.|$|E
50|$|From 1907 a 350 cc Douglas {{version was}} on sale, {{similar to the}} Fairy with the engine in-line mounted high in the frame, but without the chain driven <b>countershaft</b> beneath, and with belt final drive. Around 1911 the frame was {{modified}} to make the engine lower, and in 1912 the automatic inlet valves were replaced by mechanically operated valves.|$|E
50|$|The Ranger was an {{off-road}} Harley-Davidson motorcycle without lights, {{made only}} in 1962. It had an extra-low final-drive ratio of 7.0:1 (12-tooth <b>countershaft</b> gear and 84-tooth rear sprocket) with neither lighting system nor front fender. It {{is believed to}} have been built to consume their supply of 165 cc engines, which would not be needed for their other models.|$|E
50|$|Engine {{differences}} {{from the previous}} Model A included a single cam wheel with two cams replacing separate cam wheels for the inlet and exhaust valve, and new design of cylinder casting. Valve head diameter was enlarged and the valves were spaced further apart. The Model H was fitted with a Sturmey-Archer three-speed <b>countershaft</b> gearbox operated by a hand gear change lever.|$|E
50|$|All road wheels {{as well as}} the easily {{adjusted}} {{steering gear}} and the steering-heads have ball-bearings. There is no mention of suspension or braking systems. The omission of a mention of brakes was remedied in the advertisement displayed below - there was a pedal operated brake on the <b>countershaft</b> and a hand operated lever on internal acting brakes on the back wheels.|$|E
5000|$|The vehicle had a four-cylinder two-block {{in-line engine}} with 5,699 cc of displacement. It {{developed}} over a four-speed <b>countershaft</b> gearbox and a propeller shaft, which drove the rear wheels. The claimed maximum output was [...] at 1650 or 1750 rpm, supporting {{a top speed}} of 90 km/h (56 mph). The foot brake operated via a mechanical linkage on the drive shaft.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Century Engineering and Motor Co' of Willesden Junction, London {{produced}} motorcycles from 1902 to 1905.In 1904 their Tandem forecar {{model was}} equipped with either a 5 h.p. Aster engine, (or 6.5 h.p. with 'Begbie Audin' water cooled radiator) driving a <b>countershaft</b> by chain. The rear axle was driven by one of two chains, to give high and low speeds. A tradesman's carrier model was also listed.|$|E
