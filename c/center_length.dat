5000|$|Studies {{have been}} {{performed}} looking at the reactivity of tropocoronand complexes with biologically relevant nitric oxide (NO). The electronic structure, metal ion <b>center,</b> <b>length</b> of the polymethylene chain linker, and other variables all influence the reactivity of a tropocoronand complex with nitric oxide. In varying the aforementioned elements, the mononitrosyl, nitrito, and dinitrosyl complexes have been formed in various conditions. For example, Mn(THF)(TC-5,5) favors the mononitrosyl complex after adding stoichiometric additions of NO whereas the nitrito complex is the favored tropocoronand product when {{in the presence of}} excess NO respectively. [...] Fe(TC-5,5) also promotes NO disproportionation when in the presence of excess NO; however, in contrast to Mn, the final product is Fe(NO)(TC-5,5-NO2), where the iron retains the nitrosyl and the nitrite becomes bound to the ligand.|$|E

Methods: From a large hospital cohort of HIV-infected patients followed up in the Paris area between 1998 and 2006, we examined the effect of early syphilis on plasma HIV- 1 RNA levels and CD 4 cell counts. We compared 282 HIV- 1 –infected men diagnosed as having incident primary or secondary syphilis with 1233 syphilis-free men matched for age (± 5 years), sexual orientation, participating <b>center,</b> <b>length</b> of follow-up (± 6 months), and immunologic and virologic status before the date of syphilis diagnosis (index date).

40|$|Background: Trauma {{centers have}} {{historically}} been staffed by attending surgeons and varying levels of surgery and emergency residents. With the imposition of resident work hour restrictions {{there was a need}} for staffing solutions. One of the options that has been utilized is the addition or replacement of residents by physician assistants (PAs). What is the impact of PAs on the outcomes of trauma patients at level I centers when compared with resident only teams? Methods: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was conducted using Medline-OVID, CINAHL, and Web of Science. The keywords used for each search were: physician assistant, trauma <b>center,</b> <b>length</b> of stay, patient readmission, and hospital mortality. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to focus the search. Results: Three retrospective studies met criteria and were included and assessed for this systematic review. One study compared a resident based team with a team that added PAs and found no change in mortality rates and a reduction in length of stay (LOS). Another study compared three groups: a resident based team, an attending surgeon only team, and a PA based team. This study showed a reduction in mortality and LOS. A third study compared a PA based team with the National Trauma Data Bank. That study showed a reduction in mortality and LOS when normalizing for injury severity. Conclusion: When PAs were added to or replaced residents on trauma teams there was either no change or a reduction in patient mortality and length of stay. PAs can be a helpful and productive addition or replacement on resident based teams without negatively impacting patient outcomes...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{describe}} initial {{results and}} experimental error measurement of a protocol analyzing Human posture through sagittal intersegmental moments. METHODS: Postural analysis has been recently improved by development of three-dimensional radiographic imaging systems. However, in various situations such as global sagittal anterior malalignment interpretation of radiographs may {{not represent the}} real alignment of the subject. The {{aim of this study}} was to present initial results of a 3 D biomechanical protocol. This protocol is obtained in a free standing position and characterizes postural balance by measurement of sagittal intersegmental net moments. After elaboration of a specific marker-set, 4 successive recordings were done on two volunteers by three different operators during three sessions in order to evaluate the experimental error measurement. A supplementary acquisition in a 'radiographic' posture was also obtained. Once the data acquired, joint <b>center,</b> <b>length,</b> anatomical frame and the center of mass of each body segment was calculated and a mass affected. Sagittal net intersegmental moments were computed in an ascending manner from ground reaction forces at the ankles, knees, hips and the lumbosacral and thoraco-lumbar spinal junctions. Cervicothoracic net intersegmental moment was calculated in a descending manner. RESULTS: Based on average recordings, clinical interpretation of net intersegmental moments (in N. m) showed a dorsal flexion on the ankles (8. 6 N. m), a flexion on the knees (7. 5 N. m) and an extension on the hips (8. 5 N. m). On the spinal junctions, it was flexion moments: 0. 34 N. m on the cervico-thoracic; 6. 7 N. m on the thoraco-lumbar and 0. 65 N. m on the lumbo-sacral. Evaluation of experimental error measurement showed a small inter-trial error (intrinsic variability), with higher inter-session and inter-therapist errors but without important variation between them. For one volunteer the 'radiographic' posture was associated to significant changes compared to the free standing position. CONCLUSION: These initial results confirm the technical feasibility of the protocol. The low intrinsic error and the small differences between inter-session and intertherapist errors seem to traduce postural variability over time, more than a failure of the protocol. Characterization of sagittal intersegmental net moments can have clinical applications such as evaluation of an unfused segment after a spinal arthrodesis...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLength {{and width}} spatial {{interactions}} {{associated with a}} small test line centered on a rectangular background were measured at 0, 5 and 10 deg retinal eccentricities. Results indicated an elongated central region of summation with antagonistic flanks and end-zones comparable to earlier results [Yu and Essock (1996). Vision Research 36, 2883 – 2896]. The extent of the end-zones, flanks and <b>centers</b> (<b>length</b> and width) exhibited significantly different spatial scaling, which was steepest for the end-zones (E 2 = 0. 45 deg), less steep for the flanks (E 2 = 0. 77 deg) and least steep for the centers (E 2 = 2. 05 deg). Perceptive fields measured with concentric circular stimuli showed center and surround scaling equivalent to center and flank scaling, respectively, in line target experiments. These results suggest that: (1) psychophysical end-stopping and flank-inhibition reflect different underlying cortical neural processes; and (2) the spatial interactions apparent on the conventional Westheimer paradigm are partly governed by cortical factors.

40|$|In {{order to}} analyze x ray data, {{it is nearly}} always {{necessary}} to extract source and background events from a data set. Typically, this is done by defining geometric spatial regions of the data set to describe the source and background. For example, one might wish to extract source events from a circular or elliptical region centered at a particular pixel, and background events from a circular or elliptical annulus whose inner radius matches the source region. At the same time, it might be necessary to exclude one or more nearby sources from the source or background region in question. Thus, it might be necessary to define a pie-shaped region or even an entirely irregularly-shaped region to exclude. A spatial filtering scheme called REGIONS was implemented in IRAF/PROS to support these {{and other types of}} spatial region extraction. It allows users to create a spatial mask by specifying one or more ASCII geometric shape descriptors (box, circle, ellipse, pie, point, annulus, and polygon) as regions to be included or excluded in the mask. In addition, two or more shapes can be combined using Boolean algebra to create an infinite variety of sophisticated regions. Each geometric shape has a specific set of parameters that describe that shape. For example, a circle is described by a center and a radius, while a box is described by a <b>center,</b> <b>length,</b> width, and rotation angle. These quantities can be specified in units of pixels or, in cases where the target image contains world coordinate system information, they can be described in units such as RA and Dec. Users can create region mask files by feeding an ASCII region descriptor to the IRAF/PROS plcreate task. Temporary masks can also be created from ASCII region descriptors by individual applications that call the routines in the region creation library. This library implements a yacc-based region parser that compiles the ASCII descriptors into 'software CPU' instructions which are then executed to create the mask. The mask created from these region descriptors is a standard IRAF PLIO mask. It can be combined with other PLIO masks (e. g., exposure masks) to provide complete spatial filtering capabilities. The capabilities of the region filtering scheme are described. It also discusses the design philosophy guiding our work, as well as our plans for the future...|$|E

40|$|Variation {{of lower}} {{resonance}} frequency with <b>center</b> strip <b>length</b> {{is shown in}} Figure 7 (b). It is found that resonance frequency decreases with increasing width of notch (i. e. <b>center</b> strip <b>length).</b> Results of proposed method are {{similar to that of}} FDTD method. Little variation in the two results is due to approximation involved in the cavity theory that is used for equivalent circuit model. The variation of lower resonance frequency as a function of side strip length is shown in Figure 7 (c) along with the reported results. It is observed that the resonance frequency decreases with side strip length and the results from proposed method are in good agreement with the FDTD method. It may be mentioned that all the data obtained from proposed method are almost in good agreement with reported results. This validates the veracity of proposed method of analysis. 5. CONCLUSION It may therefore be inferred from this analysis that H-shaped patch exhibits dual resonance behavior and the resonance frequency are very sensitive to the dimensions of the notch.

40|$|BACKGROUND Estimation of age {{at death}} {{is one of the}} {{demographic}} characteristics that has extensively been studied by anthropologists, which has immense forensic importance. Age is a primary identification characteristic of an individual. The various methods employed in age estimation includes odontology, ossification centers, radiological examination, age related changes in bones and various regression formulas, etc. MATERIALS AND METHODS The present study is undertaken for the estimation of age from morphological examination of thyroid cartilage for a period of one year at Department of Forensic Medicine, Kozhikode. The study samples included thyroid cartilages from the dead bodies of 200 males and 200 females subjected to post mortem examination. The age of the study sample was taken from the data provided by the police in the requisition for post mortem examination. The observations were statistically evaluated. RESULTS The estimation of age from thyroid cartilage from morphological features includes gross examination by serial sectioning for ossification <b>centers,</b> <b>length</b> and breadth of alae, angle between alae and weight of the cartilage and mathematical calculation of these values. CONCLUSION However, none of the method stands as a gold standard as a single index as there exists considerable variations between individuals and populations. Hence, combination of different methods are often preferred for more accurate estimation of age. Thyroid cartilage has been used since ages for estimation of age using the parameters like ossification center, calcification, etc...|$|R
