5000|$|In 2002, the {{composer}} created the entire soundtrack of the Manuel Boursinhac’s film La Mentale (soundtrack Naïve). He then {{took up the}} challenge of responding to a commission (to accompany a film with music) exclusively using elements of his own musical style. In 2004, to celebrate his 20 years of career, the anthology Alezane was released as a double disc with a rich booklet designed by painter and graphic artist Eric Roux-Fontaine. Alezane is a selection of Titi’s recordings presented as two thematic CDs: Le jour offers rhythmic dance tracks, La Nuit, more intimate songs, embellished with unpublished ones, including a couple of remixed versions and reinterpreted songs. In 2005, two sets of Parisian productions took place: four nights at the Bouffes du Nord in February, five nights at the Cabaret Sauvage in November, {{on the occasion of}} the release of the new album: Ces vagues que l’amour soulève (Naïve, October 2005). While the recording sessions of previous records were often the opportunity to invite many musicians with whom Titi Robin did not necessarily tour on stage, but were ideally suited to the interpretation of one or more songs. He invited this time a more limited group of musicians, who were largely similar to those around him during the shows. Foremost is the faithful trio (Francis Varis on accordion, Kalou Stalin on bass and Ze Luis Nascimento on percussion) that accompanies him all year in Jivula (The musical and <b>choreographic</b> <b>creation</b> of Titi Robin and Gulabi Sapera), the quintet and trio, he wished omnipresent in this disc. Cantaor flamenco singer Jose Montealegre, who sings in the quintet came to enrich a suite written around the oud. The Saadna brothers (Los Rumberos Catalans), with whom he played for many years, joined him to end the disc in gypsy festivities. During the composing of the soundtrack of Manuel Boursinhac’s film, for the first time, there was a string orchestra, mainly consisting of composed of violas, cellos and basses (based on the arrangements of Renaud Gabriel Pion). Titi Robin has extended this present experience thanks to arrangements of Francis Varis on three themes. That same year, the formation [...] "En famille" [...] appeared, gathering around Gulabi Sapera and Titi Robin a new generation: Maria, Colombe “La Coque” and Dino Banjara. Maria, singing, and La Coque, at the percussions, also joined in the studio for the recording of this album. In 2005, Titi Robin composed (assisted by Silvio Soave who is his sound engineer since the early 90’s) the soundtrack of Florence Quentin’s film OLE!(Naïve). Amongst the abundant tours of the artist in France and abroad, he was invited by Alain Bashung during his carte blanche at the Cité de la Musique in June. The two musicians met on several occasions in 2006, showing a great relationship and mutual respect.|$|E

40|$|In {{continuity}} with the American Performance Art {{of the years}} 1960 - 1970, the generation of young French choreographers of the late 20 th century seems to have somewhat stepped away from dance, being {{more interested in the}} speculative dimension of <b>choreographic</b> <b>creation,</b> whether it deals with questions of identity, with the definition {{of the nature of the}} body or of dance as art. With this perspective, the texts – the dancers' readings and writings – play a central role within the creative process, in terms of poetic inspiration or of construction of meaning. The article intends to show the creative effects of the relationship between the texts and dance, starting with the choreographer Jérôme Bel's readings of the philosopher Roland Barthes, and analyzing in particular the show Nom donné par l'auteur (1994) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE THESISUsing Dance to Communicate Issues of Climate CommunicationByAmelia Rose UnsickerMaster of Fine Arts in DanceUniversity of California, Irvine, 2016 Assistant Professor Shaun Boyle, ChairClimate {{change may}} be one of the most {{pressing}} issues of our time, and yet the topic is frequently communicated inadequately, using confusing jargon and Doomsday narrative. This often makes it difficult to understand the effects of climate change on human beings and what actions we should take. Dance has the potential to convey some of the emotional attributes of climate change, impacting the dancer’s awareness of issues and influencing audiences who watch that dance performance. History tells us that choreographers create works expressing issues of their time and several serve as examples for addressing social and environmental issues in their work. This research includes the artistic approaches of six American female choreographers: Anna Sokolow, Anna Halprin, Liz Lerman, Karole Armitage, Jody Sperling, and Cassie Meador. Interviews were conducted with Karole Armitage, and with University of California, Irvine Professor of Earth Systems Science Julie Ferguson. The science behind climate change is summarized, and the issues with climate communication are presented. Both live performance and screendance are introduced as forms for climate communication. As a whole, this paper supports my <b>choreographic</b> processes, the <b>creation</b> of a live performance and a screendance, all of which express my response to issues of climate change and human interaction with nature...|$|R

DECO is a pedagogical project funded by the Institute of Learning and Teaching at the University of Northampton. The aim of the project is to develop an Open Educational Resource to support the development of <b>choreographic</b> practice. This <b>creation</b> of this resource will draw on my choreography teaching practice and my existing practice of documenting, archiving and reflecting on my choreographic work on tumblr. The project specifically aims to investigate how ‘tagging’ {{can be used to}} catalogue, arrange and rearrange materials to create an interactive, non-linear OER. It extends •	my existing research exploring social media platforms as alternative educational interfaces to traditional Virtual Learning Environments •	my practice of using tumblr to documentation, archive and critically reflect on my choreographic practice The presentation at Digital Echoes will draw on the documentation and digital preservation of a work made on first year students at the University of Northampton from September-December 2014. As part of the module Foundations in Choreography, the tutor leads a choreography project making an original work on/with the students. This approach allows students to learn about the choreographic process from within, critically engaging with and reflecting on the different tasks and decision-making processes of a choreographer. The tumblr blog for this work, Fall and Swell, acts as a blended learning resource for students alongside studio work, and as a vehicle for documentation and reflecting on my own practice. The presentation will address: •	The value of the blog as a blended learning tool to support studio practice and a documentation of learning, using my own reflections and focus groups with the student cohort •	The efficacy of documenting practice ‘as you go’ My interest in tumblr as a platform is due to its facility for tagging, as the multiple points of entry and non-linear engagement with materials sits more comfortably with creative processes, which are themselves non-linear. The presentation will therefore also address some initial conclusions about tagging as a process to arrange and catalogue content, and as a process of navigation and best practice...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} sheds a {{new light}} on collective creativity by studying the dynamics of <b>choreographic</b> <b>creation.</b> Ten choreographers were interviewed about their backgrounds, choreographic processes and collaborative approaches. The interviews were semi-­‐ structured and guided by Hargadon and Bechky’s framework on collective creativity (2006). This model was thus applied to a purely creative setting, with some interesting implications for research on collective creativity and for organizations and managers. Firstly, several important issues regarding co-­‐creation were highlighted by the unique setting, including the informal and compulsory nature of collaborative creative relationships {{and the fact that}} co-­‐creativity can be implemented differently and affected by different factors depending on several distinct approaches to the creation process. In addition, this research identified a possible fifth dimension to the model: collective research. Secondly, in terms of practical implications, this study shows the importance of professionalizing creativity, the need in some creative roles to have continuum-­‐related careers, and the need to adapt creativity-­‐reinforcing actions to the particular team and task. ...|$|E
