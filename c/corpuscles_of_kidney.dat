40|$|The cells <b>of</b> the <b>corpuscles</b> <b>of</b> Stannius {{appeared}} to be more active in eels acclimated to sea water than in eels acclimated to fresh water. In acclimated eels, however, total and ionic plasma calcium concentrations and stanniocalcin titers did not differ. This suggests that levels of stanniocalcin in freshwater-acclimated eels are sufficient to maintain normocalcemia in sea water. When freshwater-acclimated eels were transferred directly to sea water, total and ionic calcium concentrations in the plasma increased significantly within 24 h {{but there was no}} apparent effect on the <b>corpuscles</b> <b>of</b> Stannius within the same time. This suggests that changes in secretory activity <b>of</b> the <b>corpuscles</b> <b>of</b> Stannius do not occur rapidly when they are presented with a hypercalcemic challenge. Conversely, when seawater-acclimated eels were transferred to fresh or distilled water there {{appeared to}} be a very rapid reduction in secretory activity in the <b>corpuscles</b> <b>of</b> Stannius, as indicated by the rapid accumulation of secretory granules. These data suggest that stanniocalcin turnover is more rapid in seawater-acclimated eels and that the secretory activity <b>of</b> the <b>corpuscles</b> <b>of</b> Stannius is rapidly reduced when a hypercalcic challenge is removed...|$|R

In low calcium water acclimated fish, ambient cadmium induced significant hypocalcemia, while {{the structure and}} morphometry of type- 1 and type- 2 cells <b>of</b> <b>corpuscles</b> <b>of</b> Stannius were not affected on day 2 and 4. Subsequently on day 14 and 35, recovery of plasma calcium to normal levels was observed followed by a decrease in <b>corpuscles</b> <b>of</b> Stannius index (CSI), cell size, volume of granular endoplasmic reticulum (p< 0. 05) of type- 1 cells in both, fish exposed to ambient or dietary cadmium. The type- 2 cells were not affected. In high calcium water acclimated fish both, ambient and dietary cadmium caused a significant reduction of plasma calcium levels on day 2 and 4. In these fish, {{there was a significant}} transient increase in the size <b>of</b> <b>corpuscles</b> <b>of</b> Stannius on day 4, followed by recovery on day 14 and 35. Ultrastructural observations <b>of</b> <b>corpuscles</b> <b>of</b> Stannius revealed that cadmium did not cause any cellular damage on type- 1 and type- 2 cells during 35 days exposure. In low or high calcium water acclimatized tilapia exposed to ambient or dietary cadmium had no effect on the calcium and phosphate composition of the scales, operculum and vertebrae. Thus, it is unlikely that recovery of hypocalcemia was due to the dissolution of calcium from bony tissues. This study also revealed that cadmium does not mediate stimulation <b>of</b> the <b>corpuscles</b> <b>of</b> Stannius gland, and that high Ca 2 + water had a protective effect against ambient and dietary cadmium...|$|R

Methods: Fish {{were subjected to}} 2. 47 mg/L and 0. 618 mg/L of E. royleana for short-term and long-term exposure, respectively. Blood samples were collected on 24, 48, 72 and 96 h in short-term and after 7, 14, 21, and 28 d in long-term experiment and analyzed for serum calcium levels. <b>Corpuscles</b> <b>of</b> Stannius were fixed on these intervals. Results: Serum calcium levels of H. fossilis decline progressively from 48 h until 96 h following the E. royleana exposures. Serum calcium levels decreased on 7 d. This decrease continued until close of the experiment. After 96 h treatment, AF–positive cells of CS exhibit increased granulation. Nuclear volume of these cells exhibited no change throughout short-term treatment. Increased nuclear volume of AF– negative cells of CS is noticed at 96 h. Nuclear volume of AF-positive cells decreases after 14 d and onwards. The AF–positive cells exhibit increased granulation following 21 d exposure. After 28 d these changes are intensified and few degenerating cells have been encountered. AF–negative cells of CS increase in their nuclear volume 21 d onwards. Conclusion: The botanical pesticide induced severe changes in the <b>corpuscles</b> <b>of</b> Stannius of catfish. This gland controls the calcium level in fish and thus the use of E. royleana should not be done near water reservoirs. ...|$|R

No staining by the antiserum was observed in fibroblasts, muscle of any type, cartilage, blood vessel, nerve tissue, iris or lens epithelium, or the glomerular or tubular cells <b>of</b> the <b>kidney.</b> In contrast, the antiserum stained the cells of most epithelia of the intestinal tract, urinary tract (urethra, bladder, ureter, collecting ducts <b>of</b> <b>kidney),</b> female genital tract (cervix, cervical glands, uterus, and oviduct), and respiratory tract (trachea and bronchi). Epithelial cells of the fine ductal system in the pancreas and submaxillary gland also stained well. When primary cultures of epithelial cells derived from bladder, intestine, kidney, and trachea were grown on glass coverslips and stained with anti-keratin, fiber networks similar to those of cultured keratinocytes were observed. These results show that keratins constitute a cytoskeleton in epithelial cells of diverse morphology and embryological origin.

In this report, we provide evidence for the existence of STC-like proteins in vertebrates other than fishes, in particular, humans. By using a well-characterized RIA for salmon STC, sera from vertebrates as diverse as sharks and humans contained measurable levels of STC-like immunoreactivity in the concentration range commonly observed in fishes, and all of these sera exhibited parallelism in the assay. By using Western blot analysis, proteins were also identified in human kidney extracts that shared several properties with the fish hormone in addition to their cross-reactivity with salmon STC antiserum. The same antiserum was used to identify a discrete population of cells in human kidney tubules that could be the source of serum immunoreactivity. Human kidney extracts containing the STC-immunoreactive proteins also had STC-related effects when injected into fishes.
