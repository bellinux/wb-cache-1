40|$|The {{purpose of}} this degree project is to examine power outages that has {{occurred}} during the years 2009 and 2016 on Mälarenergi Elnät distribution grid. Interruptions that has occurred on 10 kV voltage level and on overhead lines or underground cable was examined. The examined interruptions {{are based on the}} DARWin data from Mälarenergi Elnät. The examined interruptions resulted in four different test grids. Test grid A are overhead line grid in rural area, test grid B are mixed grid in rural area, test grid C are underground <b>cable</b> <b>grid</b> in semi urban area and test grid D are underground <b>cable</b> <b>grid</b> in urban area. Test grid C and D which have the highest customer density were then used for reliability analysis. The reliability analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel. The main focus for the reliability analysis were the impact of different sectioning times. Another focus for the reliability analysis was introducing breakers at key-points in test grid C. The primarily cause of interruptions on overhead line grids are weather related events and on underground cable grids it is digging and fabrication or material errors. It is concluded that with quicker sectioning times, the reliability of the grid increases linearly. The introduction of breakers at key-points in the grid results in increased reliability...|$|E
40|$|The rural {{power grid}} has {{traditionally}} mostly consisted of overhead power lines. In {{recent years the}} trend has been to replace the overhead lines with cables instead. The reason is that overhead lines are relatively vulnerable, strong winds and storms can cause trees and branches to fall over the power lines and cause a phase to ground fault. This will then trip the ground fault relays and disconnect the faulty power line. A <b>cable</b> <b>grid</b> is not vulnerable in the same way, and {{could be considered a}} solution to make the power grid more reliable. A <b>cable</b> <b>grid</b> does come whit other types of problems instead. It generates about 50 times more phase to ground capacitance compared with the same length of overhead lines. When a phase to ground fault occurs the capacitance in the healthy phases will generate a current to ground and then through the fault. On average a <b>cable</b> <b>grid</b> generates about 2 A per kilometer. Large cable grids can therefore cause very large capacitive currents to flow through the fault.   To counter this, a reactor is placed between the neutral point of the transformer and ground. When a phase to ground fault occurs, the reactor will generate an inductive current which is in the opposite phase compared to the capacitive current. This current will flow through the faulty line and cancel out the capacitive current. In a perfectly tuned power grid the only component left in the fault is a smaller resistive current. Large cable grids will require a large reactor to generate the large inductive current, which might need to flow over a great distance in the grid to reach the fault location. To reduce the inductive current from the central reactor, it is possible to install smaller local reactors in the grid. These will then {{in the event of a}} phase to ground fault generate a part of the inductive current, which will reduce the currents from the central reactor. This report will look at the factors related to grounding systems and how these factors affect the ground fault currents. The purpose of the report is to give recommendations to Umeå Energi on where in their grid they should install additional local reactors and also which factors they should consider when doing future expansions and rebuilds of their power grid. ...|$|E

Transmitting data over the ubiquitous power <b>cable</b> <b>grid</b> of build-ings, vehicles, factories and the Smart Grid instead of deploying dedicated communication wires is cost effective and provides the ability to reduce a vehicle’s weight. Unfortunately the power wires also act as good antennas at the frequencies used for powerline communications. That means alien radio frequency transmissions need to be taken into account when designing PLC systems. Currently deployed PLC modems do not transmit data in certain frequency bands to avoid interference with services which could operatie in them. However, this also means they are wasting potential throughput if there is no foreign transmission at the particular location and time of the system. There are different methods to analyze and detect ongoing transmissions. The student’s task is to get an overview of current approaches and analyse the most promising one in further detail.

The distributed generation, storage and new appliances can cause high variation of load and reverse power flow, nevertheless the LV <b>cable</b> <b>grid</b> was not designed to these new stresses. The aggregate load and generation can surpass the rated capacity of the cable lines causing short term temperature increasing. This temperature stress can decrease the expected lifetime of the cable lines. In this study the short term thermal overload of LV distribution cables was investigated. The experiments were executed on PVC insulated LV cable samples and electrical and mechanical properties of the cable jacket were investigated. The effect of these short-term overloads on the expected lifetime of cables is introduced and non-destructive measurement for tracking {{the effect of the}} short term thermal overloads on the cable is suggested...|$|E
40|$|With the {{background}} of experience from field investigations in cable networks, multiple pre-strikes and re-ignitions are known to occur during switching operations, causing high frequency, steep fronted transient voltages and currents. Off-shore collection grids consist of vast amount of cables, with different length and connection points, which have low surge impedance compared with overhead lines. Consequently multiple pre-strikes and re-ignitions of switching apparatus with cables can cause transient overvoltages with higher time-derivatives than with overhead lines. The validation test circuits specified in the IEC standards developed for impulses due to fulmination on overhead lines do not consider the conditions of large <b>cable</b> <b>grid</b> and repetitive overvoltages due to switching. With the increase of cable grids and particularly wind parks, it has become important to characterize a collection grid cable system and the related transients during manoeuvres with different switching apparatus. The main contribution of this work is the experimental verification of the transient overvoltage phenomena in cable systems.

Efforts are made to stimulate development of sustainable energy sources, such as wind turbines and PV-systems. Also the {{combined heat and power}} production is encouraged. This has lead to an increasing penetration of small generating units in medium voltage (MV) grids. Small generation units, also distributed generation (DG), can {{have a significant impact on}} power flow, voltage profile, power quality and grid protection. In this article the effect of DG on grid protection is studied in detail. The paper gives an overview of current protection practices in MV-grids and shows how these practices are influenced by DG. A procedure is derived to determine the impact on protection systems in advance which can be helpful in the planning stage. To illustrate the effects a 3 -bus test grid and an existing 20 kV <b>cable</b> <b>grid</b> including high penetration of DG-units is modelled in professional software. In the models the grid protection and the protection of the DGunits are modelled as well. The simulations show that protection problems in compact cables grids are not likely.

40|$|The Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) Life Cycle Cost Assessment (OLCCA) {{is a study}} {{performed}} {{by members of the}} Lockheed Martin (LM) OTEC Team under funding from the Department of Energy (DOE), Award No. DE-EE 0002663, dated 01 / 01 / 2010. OLCCA objectives are to estimate procurement, operations and maintenance, and overhaul costs for two types of OTEC plants: -Plants moored to the sea floor where the electricity produced by the OTEC plant is directly connected to the grid ashore via a marine power <b>cable</b> (<b>Grid</b> Connected OTEC plants) -Open-ocean grazing OTEC plant-ships producing an energy carrier that is transported to designated ports (Energy Carrier OTEC plants) Costs are developed using the concept of levelized cost of energy established by DOE for use in comparing electricity costs from various generating systems. One area of system costs that had not been developed in detail prior to this analysis was the operations and sustainment (O&S) cost for both types of OTEC plants. Procurement costs, generally referred to as capital expense and O&S costs (operations and maintenance (O&M) costs plus overhaul and replacement costs), are assessed over the 30 year operational life of the plants and an annual annuity calculated to achieve a levelized cost (constant across entire plant life). Dividing this levelized cost by the average annual energy production results in a levelized cost of electricity, or LCOE, for the OTEC plants. Technical and production efficiency enhancements that could result in a lower value of the OTEC LCOE were also explored. The thermal OTEC resource for Oahu, HawaiÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂi and projected build out plan were developed. The estimate of the OTEC resource and LCOE values for the planned OTEC systems enable this information to be displayed as energy supplied versus levelized cost of the supplied energy; this curve is referred to as an Energy Supply Curve. The Oahu Energy Supply Curve represents initial OTEC deployment starting in 2018 and demonstrates the predicted economies of scale as technology and efficiency improvements are realized and larger more economical plants deployed. Utilizing global high resolution OTEC resource assessment from the Ocean Thermal Extractable Energy Visualization (OTEEV) project (an independent DOE project), Global Energy Supply Curves were generated for Grid Connected and Energy Carrier OTEC plants deployed in 2045 when the predicted technology and efficiencies improvements are fully realized.

40|$|The actual {{context of}} the energy {{transition}} is leading to the increase of renewable energy, but as a consequence, to larger investments on electricity transmission systems. While knowledge and research about environmental consequences of systems for power generation is abundant, data and available studies on environmental impacts for power transmission systems are somehow limited. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a tool for the systematic evaluation of the environmental aspects of a product or service system through all stages of its life cycle. LCA provides an adequate instrument for environmental decision support. The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), a world-wide federation of national standards bodies, has standardised this framework within the series ISO 14040 on LCA. The main phases of an LCA are: - Goal and Scope - Inventory Analysis - Impact Assessment - Interpretation By carrying out LCA of underground <b>cables,</b> <b>grid</b> system operators and cable manufacturers can evaluate and quantify the impacts of the cables during the different phases of their life cycle.

LCA is commonly used to orientate decision makers (political, companies, competent authorities [...] .). LCA studies of underground cable can be used to: - improve one given technology (for instance by identifying ways to reduce losses during operation phase); - compare different solutions or system (for instance underground cable versus over headline); - perform a study on the impact of new marine renewable energy, taking into account the connection to the electricity transmission system; - perform a broader study on the benefits/impacts of energy transition, taking into account the indirect effects on the electricity transmission system.

40|$|Transformers {{connected}} at the medium-voltage {{level in}} <b>cable</b> <b>grids,</b> such as wind park collection grids and industrial grids, {{are exposed to}} the stress of very fast transients. These electric transients are mainly generated during breaker switching operations and the rise time of the transient voltage in such systems is much shorter compared to the rise times of transients generated in transmission systems at a high-voltage level. In this paper, the internal voltage stress is studied during very fast transients generated during transformer energization. Instead of using a breaker, the energizing tests are performed using a low-impedance pulse generator that can generate lightning impulse-shaped waveforms and voltage steps with rise times varying between 35 and 500 ns. Experiments show that during very fast transients with a 35 -ns rise time and 1 -p. u. magnitude, the interturn voltage exceeds the level obtained with a lightning impulse-shaped voltage waveform of 4. 4 pu. Furthermore, during a specific switching scenario with delta-connected transformers, where the winding is excited from both ends, the same 1 -p. u. / 35 -ns voltage step generates an interturn voltage that exceeds the 1 -p. u. level, which is more than 2. 5 times higher voltage stress than during a lightning impulse test...|$|R

To realize these corridors, Voltage Source Converter High Voltage Direct Current (VSC HVDC) offers several advantages over the currently widely used ac technology. The use of VSC HVDC in a large-scale meshed grid can provide the major reinforcements to the power system needed for the integration of massive amounts of renewable energy sources. Selective protection against dc side faults is essential to safely and reliably operate meshed HVDC grids. Since required operating times for HVDC grid protection are ten to hundred times faster than existing ac protection, HVDC grid protection algorithms are fundamentally different from those used in ac systems.
