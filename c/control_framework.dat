40|$|AbstractPurpose – Definition of Management <b>Controlling</b> <b>Framework</b> (MCF) had {{undergone}} many changes during {{a short period}} of time. Definition change mostly reflected a scope transformation during this system development. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate evolution of Management <b>Controlling</b> <b>Framework,</b> to compare different approaches and discuss outcomes, to propose future development directions based on historical background. It presents a historical revision of different trends of management controlling systems in organisations, according to four indicators: scope, outcome, tools and contradictions. Johnson and Kaplan (1987) suggestion was taken as the starting point of current investigation, as it significantly affected viewpoint change and further behaviour. Design/methodology/approach – A systematic literature review of publications in public sector, management and accounting journals since 1990 was conducted with the aim to answer the research questions: 1. How Management <b>Controlling</b> <b>Framework</b> are described? 2. What are the main characteristics of MCF? 3. How scope of Management <b>Controlling</b> <b>Framework</b> changed over time. 4. What are the main contradictions? Data analysis was performed using Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TIPS, TRIZ), and a special part of this theory — ‘Laws of (technical) systems evolution’ (LTSE). Findings – Overall, the results confirm that Management <b>Controlling</b> <b>Framework</b> (MCF) can be described and trended through Laws of (technical) systems evolution. These findings provide the following insights for future research such as solve contradictions: 1. Overview, but not overload (detalization problem). 2. Subsidiary independent, but over control (HQ involvement problem) 3. Managing Innovation versus Managing Operations (development problem). 4. Differentiation and unification (culture problem). 5. Leadership versus review (GM problem). 6. Common understanding on the control way and results quantification (Measurement identity problem). Research limitations/implications – Generalisation of research results is limited by three main <b>controlling</b> <b>frameworks</b> and Agency theory as additional lever.

40|$|Abstract: Situations {{can arise}} in which {{organizations}} have to merge {{policies that are}} based on different access <b>control</b> <b>frameworks,</b> such as Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and Mandatory Access Control (MAC). Integrating policies requires addressing the following question: How will the integration impact access to protected resources? In particular, one needs to determine that the integration does not result in security breaches or unavailability of resources. A way of addressing these concerns is to model the access <b>control</b> <b>frameworks,</b> compose the models, and analyze the resulting model to identify problems. In this paper we outline a technique for modeling and composing access <b>control</b> policy <b>frameworks.</b> Specifically, we model RBAC and MAC using a variant of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and show how to compose the models. The composed model {{can be used as a}} base for defining access control policies in a military domain.

40|$|Publication of {{this article}} was funded by the Stellenbosch University Open Access Fund. The {{original}} publication is available at [URL] today’s technologically advanced business environments, Information Technology (IT) has become the center of most, if not all, business activities; consequently, the King III report in South Africa dedicated a chapter to IT governance principles, making senior management responsible for implementing such principles. The King III’s implementation guidance lacks detail as to how to implement its principles. Although various guidelines in the form of IT <b>control</b> <b>frameworks</b> - models and standards - exist, it remains theoretical in nature. Companies tend to view these <b>control</b> <b>frameworks</b> on an individual basis, implementing them in an ad hoc manner, resulting in the implementation of an inefficient IT governance system that either addresses strategic areas, but not operational areas, of a business or vice versa. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop an IT best practices integrated framework that can assist management in implementing an effective IT governance system at both a strategic and operational level. The integrated framework was developed by performing a detailed literature review of selected best practice <b>control</b> <b>frameworks</b> and its underlying processes. By combining the relevant processes of the <b>control</b> <b>frameworks</b> and aligning them to general business’ imperatives, IT governance principles can be implemented at a strategic level. By identifying and linking the relevant business imperatives and control areas to the access paths of an IT system, IT governance principles can be implemented at an operational level. By making use of the integrated framework, an IT governance system can be implemented at both a strategic and operational level. Stellenbosch UniversityPublishers' versio...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis of}} this paper is that the {{management}} control package of small rapidly growing firms in turbulent environments needs to be based on a dynamic conception of balance. While many contemporary management <b>control</b> <b>frameworks</b> endorse balance as a guiding principle for management control, its specific features receive little attention and implicit conceptions are static. This paper first characterizes the balance of a control package in terms of situational requirements on component selection, component weight, relations and coherence. The paper then examines the consistency between balance in contemporary management <b>control</b> <b>frameworks</b> and implications for balance derived from firm attributes. The conclusions suggest that by considering balance as a state and as an act, acknowledging requirements of balance and imbalance, and recognizing situational and temporal dimensions of balance, we may advance the boundaries of management control research.

40|$|Abstract — Legged robots are {{typically}} in rigid {{contact with the}} environment at multiple locations, which add a degree of complexity to their control. We present a method to control the motion and {{a subset of the}} contact forces of a floating-base robot. We derive a new formulation of the lexicographic optimization problem typically arising in multi-task motion/force <b>control</b> <b>frameworks.</b> The structure of the constraints of the problem (i. e. the dynamics of the robot) allows us to find a sparse analytical solution. This leads to an equivalent optimization with reduced computational complex-ity, comparable to inverse-dynamics based approaches. At the same time, our method preserves the flexibility of optimization based <b>control</b> <b>frameworks.</b> Simulations were carried out to achieve different multi-contact behaviors on a 23 -degree-of-freedom humanoid robot, validating the presented approach. A comparison with another state-of-the-art control technique with similar computational complexity shows the benefits of our controller, which can eliminate force/torque discontinuities. I...|$|R
