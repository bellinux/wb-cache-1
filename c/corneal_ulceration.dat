5|$|Infection with {{smallpox}} {{is focused}} in small blood vessels {{of the skin}} and in the mouth and throat before disseminating. In the skin it results in a characteristic maculopapular rash and, later, raised fluid-filled blisters. V. major produced a more serious disease and had an overall mortality rate of 30–35 percent. V. minor caused a milder form of disease (also known as alastrim) which killed about 1 percent of those it infects. Long-term complications of V. major infection included characteristic scars, commonly on the face, which occur in 65–85 percent of survivors. Blindness resulting from <b>corneal</b> <b>ulceration</b> and scarring, and limb deformities due to arthritis and osteomyelitis were less common complications, seen in about 2–5 percent of cases.|$|E

40|$|The {{complications}} of photorefractive keratectomy with excimer laser for myopia depend on preoperative myopia and inter-individual variability in wound healing. Loss of best corrected visual acuity is induced by Haze, irregular astigmatism and decentration. Haze is more frequent after treatment of high myopia. Decentration is a severe complication because its treatment {{is not well}} defined and is difficult. <b>Corneal</b> <b>ulcerations</b> infectious and non-infectious have been reported. Other complications are described: induced astigmatism, over and under corrections, central islands, halos, loss of corneal sensitivity, abnormal epithelial healing, recurrent epithelial breakdown, sterile corneal infiltrates, elevated intraocular pressure, subretinal hemorrhage.

2500|$|Diagnosis of FVR {{is usually}} by {{clinical}} signs, especially <b>corneal</b> <b>ulceration.</b> [...] Definitive diagnosis {{can be done}} by direct immunofluorescence or virus isolation. However, many healthy cats are subclinical carriers of feline herpes virus, so a positive test for FHV-1 does not necessarily indicate that signs of an upper respiratory tract infection are due to FVR.

2500|$|Much of {{the pain}} {{associated}} with <b>corneal</b> <b>ulceration</b> {{is due to the}} secondary uveitis and miosis, and effective relief can often be gained with topical atropine(1%), leading to mydriasis. [...] Dosing is generally q4h initially, and then as required to maintain dilation. [...] Mydriasis is also important to avoid some of the complications associated with uveitis, such as synechiae formation and glaucoma. [...] Pain is also associated with inflammatory response occurring in the adjacent sclera and conjunctiva, and systemic analgesia in the form of NSAIDs is usually indicated, for example, flunixin meglumin 1.1mg/kg, BID. [...] Topical NSAIDs are available (diclofenac, flurbiprofen) and effective, but have been shown to increase corneal healing time.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{symptoms}} {{can vary}} greatly between affected individuals, even those {{within the same}} family, symptoms normally begin in infancy and are typically a result of thickening skin and mucous membranes. [...] The first symptom is often a weak cry or a hoarse voice due to a thickening of the vocal cords. [...] The hoarse voice {{can be one of}} the most striking clinical manifestations of the disease. Lesions and scars also appear on the skin, usually the face and the distal parts of the limbs. This is often the result of poor wound healing and the scarring continues to increase as the patient ages, leaving the skin with a waxy appearance. [...] Skin may be easily damaged as a result of only a minor trauma or injury, leaving many blisters and additional scars. The skin is also usually very dry and wrinkly. [...] White or yellow infiltrates form on the lips, buccal mucosa, tonsils, uvula, epiglottis and frenulum of the tongue. This can lead to upper respiratory tract infection and sometimes requires tracheostomy to relieve the symptom. Too much thickening of the frenulum can restrict tongue movement and may result in speech impediments. Beading of the papules around the eyelids is a very common symptom and is often used as part of a diagnosis of the disease. [...] Some other dermatological symptoms that are sometimes seen but less common include hair loss, parotitis and other dental abnormalities, <b>corneal</b> <b>ulceration,</b> and focal degeneration of the macula.|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Nicorandil is an {{antianginal}} drug {{used for}} 20 years in Japan and introduced in France in 1994. Since 1997, side effects such as mucocutaneous ulcerations have regularly been reported. OBJECTIVE: To describe {{the first case}} of a patient with a spontaneous corneal perforation associated with mucocutaneous ulcerations while taking Nicorandil. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 81 -year-old patient, with no past history of ocular disease but a long past history of cardiovascular disease, presented with a spontaneous paracentral corneal perforation. This was consecutive to 5 months of recurrent keratoconjunctivitis and mucocutaneous ulcerations resistant to conventional therapy. (He was taking nicorandil for 5 years.) A penetrating keratoplasty was performed in emergency. RESULTS: Inflammatory and infectious causes of spontaneous corneal perforation were ruled out. After initial uneventful post-operative wound healing, an epithelial ulcer appeared on the graft. Dermatologists suggested the iatrogenic role of nicorandil and the drug was discontinued. Both mucocutaneous and <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcerations</b> resolved rapidly. DISCUSSION: Although mucocutaneous ulcerations have been attributed several times to nicorandil, this is, to our knowledge, the first major corneal damage due to this antianginal drug. Timing, pattern of illness, absence of other aetiology, recurrence of epithelial <b>ulceration</b> on the <b>corneal</b> graft and its spontaneous healing after nicorandil discontinuation make it highly apparent probable that nicorandil was directly involved in this corneal perforation. CONCLUSION: Ophthalmologists and dermatologists {{should be aware of}} the risk of severe but reversible <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcerations</b> in patients treated with nicorandil. A pharmacovigilance warning statement should be compulsory...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) Visante provides easy, high-resolution observation free {{of contact}} with the cornea and anterior segment. We present the progression of a neurotrophic corneal ulcer treated with amniotic membrane grafts studied with this system. METHODS: A 71 -year-old patient with facial nerve paresis secondary to vestibular schwannoma surgery presented with a neurotrophic perforated corneal ulcer. Since medical treatment had failed, we performed an amniotic membrane graft. The OCT Visante was used for follow-up for 2 months. RESULTS: Progression was slow but the perforation eventually closed. Cicatrization of the corneal ulcer was followed with the OCT Visante to document the healing process and corneal thickness.

40|$|We {{report a}} patient with bilaterally {{symmetrical}} perforated corneal ulcers with formation of anterior staphyloma associated with scrofuloderma. A 22 -year-old female in her third month postpartum presented with multiple perforated corneal ulcers bilaterally. There was a presence of a skin lesion that was consistent with scrofuloderma. Fine needle aspiration cytology of preauricular lymph nodes showed evidence of granulomatous inflammation consistent with tuberculosis. Corneal scraping revealed the presence of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. She was treated with topical fortified combination antibiotics (cefazolin and tobramycin). The corneal ulcer resolved with formation of anterior staphyloma in both eyes. The patient underwent anterior staphylectomy and tectonic keratoplasty in both eyes.

40|$|Triple A or Allgrove {{syndrome}} (AS) (MIM 231550) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} disorder of adreno cortico tropic hormone (ACTH) resistant adrenal insufficiency, achalasia and alacrimia (1). While alacrimia is often present at birth, and if untreated may lead to acute keratopathy and <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcerations</b> (2), achalasia manifests with age with dysphagia and feeding difficulties together with adrenal insufficiency (3, 4). This core phenotype may evolve with progressive neurological degeneration, cutaneous alterations (palmoplantar hyperkeratosis), short stature and osteoporosis (5 – 7), the first cause of death being an undiagnosed ‘adrenal crisis’. AS is caused by mutations in the AAAS gene (8 – 10), encoding Aladin, {{a member of the}} nucleoporin family at the nuclear pore complex (NPC), composed of a central 170 -aa domain with four WD repeats (11).

40|$|PURPOSE: Ocular mucous {{membrane}} pemphigoid (OMMP) is an autoimmune disease involving {{the eye and}} characterized by subepithelial detachment resulting from an immunologic reaction against conjunctival basal membrane zone (BMZ) antigens. Lyell syndrome (LS) is a drug-induced, T cell-mediated, cytotoxic reaction involving the mucocutaneous areas. Two patients with LS are presented in whom OMMP developed. DESIGN: Report of 2 cases. PARTICIPANTS: Two male patients, 80 and 60 years old, with persistent <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcerations,</b> <b>corneal</b> melting, and inflammation some months after an LS episode. METHODS: Conjunctival biopsy samples were obtained to perform direct immunofluorescence (DIF) and histologic analyses. Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) also were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Immunodeposit findings on the conjunctival BMZ obtained by DIF and IIF, inflammatory infiltration of the corneoconjunctival samples studied by histologic analysis, and autoantibodies of patient sera directed against BMZ antigens tested by ELISA. RESULTS: Direct immunofluorescence analyses showed immunoglobulin G and complement 3 component deposits along the BMZ in a linear pattern. Histologic analysis revealed the presence of eosinophils, neutrophils, and mast cells with fibrin deposition in the substantia propria of both patients; the data confirmed the clinical suspicion of OMMP. The IIF and ELISA results were negative. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic eye surface injury associated with LS may promote autoimmunization against ocular epithelial BMZ antigens, playing a strategic role in the subsequent onset of OMMP. The occurrence of OMMP after LS could be an occasional finding, or conversely, LS could be an underestimated predisposing factor {{in the development of}} OMMP...|$|R
40|$|Acanthamoeba castellani and Acanthamoeba polyphaga are {{free-living}} amebae {{that cause}} keratitis and granulomatous encephalitis in humans. We have analyzed the early morphological and electrophysiological changes occurring during the in vitro interaction of cultured amebae with intact or physically damaged corneas obtained from hamsters. Both species of Acanthamoeba produced similar cytopathic changes, {{as seen by}} light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. After adhesion to the epithelial surface, trophozoites formed clumps and migrated toward the cell borders, causing the separation of adjacent cells at 1 h of coculture. At later stages (2 to 4 h), some amebae were found under desquamating epithelial cells whereas others were seen associated with damaged cells or forming amebostome-like structures to ingest detached epithelial cells. Control corneas incubated in culture medium conditioned with amebae showed a cytoplasmic vacuolization and blurring of the epithelial-stromal junction. The early stages of corneal epithelial damage caused by amebae were also analyzed by measuring the transepithelial resistance changes in corneas mounted in Ussing chambers. Both species of Acanthamoeba caused a rapid decrease in electrical resistance. The present observations demonstrate that under in vitro conditions, Acanthamoeba trophozoites rapidly cause significant damage to the corneal epithelium. Furthermore, in our experimental model, previous physical damage to the corneas was not a prerequisite {{for the development of}} amebic <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcerations...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus 1 (HSV- 1) strainMcKrae is highly virulent {{compared}} to other wild-type strains of HSV- 1. To help us better understand the genetic determinants that lead to differences in the pathogenicity of McKrae and other HSV- 1 strains, we sequenced its genome. Comparing the sequence of McKrae’s genome to that of strain 17 revealed that the genomes differ by at least 752 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 86 insertion/deletion events (indels). Although {{the majority of these}} poly-morphisms reside in noncoding regions, 241 SNPs and 10 indels alter the protein-coding sequences of 58 open reading frames. Some of these variations are expected to contribute to the pathogenic phenotype of McKrae. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV- 1) is a double-stranded DNA,enveloped virus of theHerpesviridae family. HSV- 1 infections can be asymptomatic or cause cold sores, <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcerations,</b> or life-threatening encephalitis (9). Studies examining a variety of HSV- 1 strains show a broad spectrum of virulent and pathogenic phenotypes. Notably, the HSV- 1 strain McKrae reactivates at a high frequency and is more neurovirulent in animal models than other strains of HSV- 1 (4, 7, 8, 10, 11).
