5|$|On October 30, 1970, {{less than}} two months after introduction, 26,000 Pintos were {{recalled}} to address a possible problem with the accelerator sticking on once engaged at more than halfway. On March 29, 1971, Ford recalled 220,000 Pintos, all Pintos manufactured prior to March 19, 1971, to address a possible problem with fuel vapors in the engine air filter igniting by a backfire through the <b>carburetor.</b>|$|E
5|$|The engine used {{a single}} updraft carburetor; early {{versions}} used a Stromberg unit, which {{was replaced by}} a Schebler unit. The <b>carburetor</b> was {{on the right side of}} the engine, the mixture went into a passage through the engine block to the intake manifold on the left side of the engine. Ignition was by Delco coil and breaker points, with the distributor at the end of the generator/starter unit.|$|E
5|$|Underground mine shafts, some {{reaching}} depths over , {{were created}} for the extraction of metal ores. Borehole drilling and derricks were used to lift brine to iron pans where it was distilled into salt. The distillation furnaces were heated by natural gas funneled to the surface through bamboo pipelines. Dangerous amounts of additional gas were siphoned off via <b>carburetor</b> chambers and exhaust pipes.|$|E
50|$|The XZ550 was {{the first}} Yamaha model to feature automotive-style {{downdraft}} <b>carburetors</b> with the air cleaner box mounted atop the <b>carburetors,</b> as opposed to most motorcycles' sidedraft <b>carburetors</b> with their side-mounted air cleaners. While downdraft <b>carburetors</b> flow air into the engine more efficiently than sidedraft <b>carburetors,</b> {{the height of the}} <b>carburetors</b> and their airbox required Yamaha to design a large tunnel {{into the bottom of the}} gas tank. While the tank holds 17 liters(4.5 gallons) of fuel, it looks much larger thanks to the tunnel and suggests that the bike is top-heavy, which it is not.|$|R
50|$|Note: <b>Carburetors</b> {{are largely}} {{dependent}} on {{air volume flow}} and vacuum, and neither directly infers mass. Consequently, <b>carburetors</b> are precise, but not accurate fuel metering devices. <b>Carburetors</b> were replaced by more accurate fuel metering methods, such as fuel injection in combination with an air mass flow sensor (MAF).|$|R
25|$|After 1938 high {{performance}} aircraft engines were equipped with floatless pressure <b>carburetors,</b> especially those engines used in combat aircraft. These <b>carburetors</b> {{were a big}} step forward in technology, and could be looked upon as mechanical counterparts of today's electronic fuel control computers. These floatless pressure <b>carburetors</b> are the topic of this article.|$|R
5|$|The Indianapolis Motor Speedway complex {{was built}} in 1909, inaugurating {{a new era in}} history. Most Indiana cities within 200 miles of Detroit became part of the giant {{automobile}} industry after 1910. The Indianapolis speedway was a venue for auto companies to show off their products. The Indianapolis 500 quickly became the standard in auto racing as European and American companies competed to build the fastest automobile and win at the track. Industrial and technological industries thrived during this era, George Kingston developed an early <b>carburetor</b> in 1902; in 1912, Elwood Haynes received a patent for stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights {{wrote to}} several engine manufacturers, but none met {{their need for}} a {{sufficiently}} lightweight powerplant. They turned to their shop mechanic, Charlie Taylor, who built an engine in just six weeks in close consultation with the brothers. To keep the weight low enough, the engine block was cast from aluminum, a rare practice for the time. The Wright/Taylor engine had a primitive version of a <b>carburetor,</b> and had no fuel pump. Gasoline was gravity-fed from the fuel tank mounted on a wing strut into a chamber next to the cylinders where it was mixed with air: the fuel-air mixture was then vaporized by heat from the crankcase, forcing it into the cylinders.|$|E
5|$|The Ford Model T, {{produced}} from 1908 through 1927, was {{fitted with a}} <b>carburetor</b> with adjustable jetting, allowing use of ethanol, gasoline or kerosene (each by itself), {{or a combination of}} the first two mentioned fuels. Other car manufactures also provided engines for ethanol fuel use. Henry Ford continued to advocate for ethanol as fuel even during the prohibition. However, cheaper oil caused gasoline to prevail, until the 1973 oil crisis resulted in gasoline shortages and awareness on the dangers of oil dependence. This crisis opened a new opportunity for ethanol and other alternative fuels, such as methanol, gaseous fuels such as CNG and LPG, and also hydrogen. Ethanol, methanol and natural gas CNG were the three alternative fuels that received more attention for research and development, and government support.|$|E
5000|$|Multiple <b>carburetors</b> can {{be mounted}} on a single engine, often with {{progressive}} linkages; two four-barrel <b>carburetors</b> (often referred to as [...] "dual-quads") were frequently seen on high performance American V8s, and multiple two barrel <b>carburetors</b> are often now seen on very high performance engines. Large numbers of small <b>carburetors</b> have also been used (see photo), though this configuration can limit the maximum air flow through the engine {{due to the lack}} of a common plenum; with individual intake tracts, not all cylinders are drawing air at once as the engine's crankshaft rotates.|$|R

5000|$|Dell'Orto is an Italian company, {{headquartered}} in Cabiate, specialized {{in the construction}} of <b>carburetors</b> and electronic injection systems. The company was founded in 1933 as [...] "Società anonima Gaetano Dell'Orto e figli" [...] (Gaetano Dell’Orto and Sons). Their first products were <b>carburetors</b> that came fitted as standard to new vehicles.Shortly before the Second World War they began producing <b>carburetors</b> with aluminium bodies for use in motorcycle racing.|$|R
5|$|These flights covered {{performance}} tests {{such as we}} do on planes undergoing Navy tests. The very first flight exposed weaknesses of the Zero which our pilots could exploit with proper tactics... immediately apparent {{was the fact that}} the ailerons froze up at speeds above 200 knots so that rolling maneuvers at those speeds were slow and required much force on the control stick. It rolled to the left much easier than to the right. Also, its engine cut out under negative acceleration due to its float-type <b>carburetor.</b> We now had the answer for our pilots who were being outmaneuvered and unable to escape a pursuing Zero: Go into a vertical power dive, using negative acceleration if possible to open the range while the Zero's engine was stopped by the acceleration. At about 200 knots, roll hard right before the Zero pilot could get his sights lined up.|$|E
5|$|Dew {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew point is a saturation point. When the dew point temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The dew point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the dew point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the dew point determines the specific humidity of the air. The dew point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of <b>carburetor</b> icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E
25|$|The {{diaphragm}} located closest the <b>carburetor</b> body is the air metering diaphragm. It {{measures the}} difference in air pressure taken from two locations within the <b>carburetor.</b> Chambers A and B are {{on opposite sides of}} the air metering diaphragm.|$|E

50|$|Modern digital {{electronic}} {{fuel injection}} systems optimize these competing objectives more effectively and consistently than earlier fuel delivery systems (such as <b>carburetors).</b> <b>Carburetors</b> {{have the potential to}} atomize fuel better (see Pogue and Allen Caggiano patents).|$|R
50|$|In modern times, fuel {{injection}} has replaced <b>carburetors</b> in both production cars and most modern motor racing, although Weber <b>carburetors</b> are still used extensively in classic and historic racing. They are also supplied as high quality replacements for problematic OEM <b>carburetors.</b> Weber fuel system components are distributed by Magneti Marelli, Webcon UK Ltd., and, in North America, by several organizations, including Worldpac, marketing under the Redline name. Other suppliers include Overseas Distributing and Pierce Manifolds.|$|R

5000|$|Ford {{purchased}} the Auto Dash factory and nearby property and in 1938 opened a plant, officially {{known as the}} [...] "Pettibone Creek Hydroelectric Station," [...] on the Upper Mill Pond. [...] The plant consisted of two hydroelectric powerhouses (the Huron River and Pettibone Creek stations) and a manufacturing facility. The facility was designed by Albert Kahn. The Milford site was used to produce <b>carburetors.</b> The initial capacity of the facility was 2,450 <b>carburetors</b> per day; a renovation in 1945 increased the capacity to 3,200 <b>carburetors</b> per day.|$|R
