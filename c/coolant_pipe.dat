5000|$|The Design Basis Accident (DBA) for {{a nuclear}} power plant is the most severe {{possible}} single accident that the designers of the plant and the regulatory authorities could reasonably expect. It is, also, by definition, the accident the safety systems of the reactor are designed to respond to successfully, even if it occurs when the reactor is in its most vulnerable state. The DBA for the BWR consists of the total rupture of a large <b>coolant</b> <b>pipe</b> in the location that is considered to place the reactor in the most danger of harm—specifically, for older BWRs (BWR/1-BWR/6), the DBA consists of a [...] "guillotine break" [...] in the coolant loop of one of the recirculation jet pumps, which is substantially below the core waterline (LBLOCA, large break loss of coolant accident) combined with loss of feedwater {{to make up for the}} water boiled in the reactor (LOFW, loss of proper feedwater), combined with a simultaneous collapse of the regional power grid, resulting in a loss of power to certain reactor emergency systems (LOOP, loss of offsite power). The BWR is designed to shrug this accident off without core damage.|$|E
5000|$|The reactor {{was placed}} {{to allow for}} access from above for refueling. The 74-MW reactor is a tall, narrow cylinder, housed in a {{cylindrical}} containment vessel with rounded ends and a 14 ft diameter vertical cylindrical projection housing the control rods and refueling equipment. The 50 ft long containment vessel houses the pressurized-water reactor, the primary coolant loop and the steam generator. The steel vessel has a wall thickness varying from 2.5 in to 4 in, designed to accommodate the [...] (gauge) pressure generated by a ruptured primary <b>coolant</b> <b>pipe.</b> There are two 42 in diameter manholes {{in the top of}} the containment vessel. Two 24 in by 18 in manholes in the bottom of the containment vessel are designed to admit water to the containment vessel if the ship sinks in more than 100 ft of water to prevent the pressure vessel's collapse. The containment vessel was not occupied under operational conditions, but could be accessed within 30 minutes of reactor shut-down. The lower half of the containment vessel is shielded by a 4 ft concrete barrier. The upper half is shielded by 6 in of lead and 6 in of polyethylene. A collision mat shields the sides of the vessel with alternating layers of 1 in steel and 3 in of redwood in a 24 in assembly.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} forces on a <b>coolant</b> <b>pipe</b> in wetwell from waterjets {{after a full}} scale loss-of-coolant-accident(LOCA) in a nuclear reactor. The waterjets {{are part of a}} {{pressure}} suppression system constructed {{to be able to take}} care of ruptures in the reactor. Thermodynamical simulations in RELAP 5 show that, at the bottom of dry- well, there is an initial pressure wave in drywell during the first 20 ms. After this the pressure rises almost linearly during the first second to 324 kPa gauge pressure. Fluid flow simulations in FLUENT show that the water initially standing in the blowdown pipes is blown out 570 ms after the LOCA with a final speed of 14 m/s. As the <b>coolant</b> <b>pipe</b> is hit by the jet it experiences oscillating forces with a maximum of 13 kN/m after 900 ms. The simulations were per- formed using the k − ε model.

40|$|The {{design basis}} for a loss of coolant {{accident}} in nuclear power plants has previously been {{based on the assumption that}} the largest size <b>coolant</b> <b>pipe</b> instantaneously undergoes a double ended “guillotine ” break (DEGB) and the resulting loss of water must be mitigated by an emergency core cooling system (ECCS) to maintain core cooling after shutdown. The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is close to allowing a risk-informed design basis break size, called the Transition Break Size (TBS), to be used for LOCA break size assumptions for ECCS design. The TBS approach will require full safety redundancy for an ECCS system sized to handle a break of the next largest reactor <b>coolant</b> <b>pipe</b> size (rather than the largest reactor <b>coolant</b> <b>pipe</b> size), and it will allow relaxed system redundancy requirements for handling the largest pipe break size. The TBS will thereby reduce the cost of the safety-grade ECCS system in new plant designs and will increase operational flexibility in existing plants. The TBS approach is based on the results of NRC elicitation studies with piping experts regarding historical pipe performance and risk of sudden failure. The approach is non-deterministic and is a conceptual change from the largest-pipe-size break assumption. The conceptual discontinuity between deterministic and elicitation-based break size assumptions could be uncomfortable for those schooled in strictly deterministic accident analyses. In this paper we explore the “leak-before-break ” (LBB) methodology as it applies to large pipe break analyses in nuclear piping systems, and show through examples that the elicitation-based TBS approach is indeed conservative when TBS results are compared with deterministic LBB evaluations of similar piping systems. Thus, LBB provides a deterministic means for showing defense in depth against LOCAs greater than the TBS break size...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to study the {{fundamental}} physical phenoena associated with air ingress in very high temperature reactors (VHTRs). Air ingress may occur due to a nupture of primary piping and a subsequent breach in the primary pressure boundary in helium-cooled and graphite-moderated VHTRs. Significant air ingress is a concern because it introduces potential to expose the fuel, graphite support rods, and core to a risk of severe graphite oxidation. Two of the most probable air ingress scenarios involve rupture of a control rod or fuel access standpipe, and rupture in the main <b>coolant</b> <b>pipe</b> on {{the lower part of}} the reactor pressure vessel. Therefor, establishing a fundamental understanding of air ingress phenomena is critical in order to rationally evaluate safety of existing VHTRs and develop new designs that mimimize these risks. But despite this importance, progress toward development these predictive capabilities has been slowed by the complex nature of the underlaying phenomena. The combination of interdiffusion among multiple species, molecular diffusion, natural convection, and complex geometries, as well as the multiple chemical reactions involved, impose significant roadblocks to both modeling and experiment design. The project team will employ a coordinated experimental and computational effort that will help gain a deeper understanding of multiphased air ingress phenomena. THis project will enhance advanced modeling and simulation methods, enabling calculation of nuclear power plant transients and accident scenarios with a high degree of confidence.

40|$|In {{support of}} a small column ion {{exchange}} (SCIX) process for the Savannah River Site waste processing program, a transient two-dimensional heat transfer model that includes the conduction process neglecting the convection cooling mechanism inside the crystalline silicotitanate (CST) column has been constructed and heat transfer calculations made for the present design configurations. For this situation, a no process flow condition through the column was assumed {{as one of the}} reference conditions for the simulation of a loss-of-flow accident. A series of the modeling calculations has been performed using a computational heat transfer approach. Results for the baseline model indicate that transit times to reach 130 degrees Celsius maximum temperature of the CST-salt solution column are about 96 hours when the 20 -in CST column with 300 Ci/liter heat generation source and 25 degrees Celsius initial column temperature is cooled by natural convection of external air as a primary heat transfer mechanism. The modeling results for the 28 -in column equipped with water jacket systems on the external wall surface of the column and water <b>coolant</b> <b>pipe</b> {{at the center of the}} CST column demonstrate that the column loaded with 300 Ci/liter heat source can be maintained non-boiling indefinitely. Sensitivity calculations for several alternate column sizes, heat loads of the packed column, engineered cooling systems, and various ambient conditions at the exterior wall of the column have been performed under the reference conditions of the CST-salt solution to assess the impact of those parameters on the peak temperatures of the packed column for a given transient time. The results indicate that a water-coolant pipe at the center of the CST column filled with salt solution is the most effective one among the potential design parameters related to the thermal energy dissipation of decay heat load. It is noted that the cooling mechanism at the wall boundary of the column has significant impact on maximum and wall temperatures of the column. In addition, the results computed by the present model were verified by the theoretical results. The analysis results will provide quantitative information associated with the process heat control and management of the CST base design. For example, transient responses of the CST system under a loss-of-flow accident condition will provide safety design information for an emergency cooling system of the column...|$|E

40|$|In {{support of}} a small column ion {{exchange}} (SCIX) process for the Savannah River Site waste processing program, transient and steady state two-dimensional heat transfer models have been constructed for columns loaded with cesium-saturated crystalline silicotitanate (CST) or spherical Resorcinol-Formaldehyde (RF) beads and 6 molar sodium tank waste supernate. Radiolytic decay of sorbed cesium results in heat generation within the columns. The models consider conductive heat transfer only with no convective cooling and no process flow within the columns (assumed column geometry: 27. 375 in ID with a 6. 625 in OD center-line cooling pipe). Heat transfer at the column walls was assumed to occur by natural convection cooling with 35 C air. A number of modeling calculations were performed using this computational heat transfer approach. Minimal additional calculations were also conducted to predict temperature increases expected for salt solution processed through columns of various heights at the slowest expected operational flow rate of 5 gpm. Results for the bounding model with no process flow and no active cooling indicate that {{the time required to}} reach the boiling point of {approx} 130 C for a CST-salt solution mixture containing 257 Ci/liter of Cs- 137 heat source (maximum expected loading for SCIX applications) at 35 C initial temperature is about 6 days. Modeling results for a column actively cooled with external wall jackets and the internal <b>coolant</b> <b>pipe</b> (inlet coolant water temperature: 25 C) indicate that the CST column can be maintained non-boiling under these conditions indefinitely. The results also show that the maximum temperature of an RF-salt solution column containing 133 Ci/liter of Cs- 137 (maximum expected loading) will never reach boiling under any conditions (maximum predicted temperature without cooling: 88 C). The results indicate that a 6 -in cooling pipe {{at the center of the}} column provides the most effective cooling mechanism for reducing the maximum temperature with either ion exchange material. Sensitivity calculations for the RF resin porosity, the ambient external column temperature, and the cooling system configuration were performed under the baseline conditions to assess the impact of these parameters on the maximum temperatures. It is noted that the cooling mechanism at the column boundary (forced versus natural convection) and the cooling system configuration significantly impact the maximum temperatures.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to perform thermo-mechanical {{analyses}} and design optimization of the Helium Cooled Pebble Bed Test Blanket Module (HCPB-TBM) box. In {{the frame of the}} EU-TBM Consortium of Associates, and with the support of Fusion for Energy (F 4 E), the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) designed and developed the HCPB-TBM. The TBM works as first wall, breeding blanket, shielding and structure. In particular the TBM box has to withstand extremely severe thermo-mechanical conditions. The thermal and mechanical analyses have been carried out with the Finite Element commercial code ANSYS and have been compared by a theoretical approach. Starting from the reference configuration of the HCPB-TBM box and its loading conditions, steady state and transient thermal analyses of the box and its internal components have been performed, under normal and accidental conditions. Subsequently design optimizations of the reference configuration have been proposed and analyzed in order to improve the thermal behavior of the components. Moreover the TBM first wall has been analyzed. Steady state and transient thermal analyses have been performed in order to identify critical areas and to investigate the impact of key design parameters on the FW thermal performances. Two transient thermal analyses have been carried out. The first transient thermal analysis simulates an ITER pulse, while the second has been based on accidental scenario, that is an ex-vessel loss of coolant accident (LOCA) caused by a double-ended pipe break of a helium <b>coolant</b> <b>pipe.</b> Ex-vessel LOCA is considered {{as one of the most}} critical accident for the HCPB TBM. The loss of helium could cause an immediate loss of the TBM cooling capabilities, and would initiate a prompt plasma shutdown. Even after the plasma shutdown the temperature on the TBM FW could increase above the design limit and the accident sequence could cause the break of the TBM box. Models sensitivity studies were performed. The sensitivity studies have been performed for all subcomponents in order to analyze the model response to the variation of the input parameters. The sensitivity studies allow to take into account the uncertainties of the input data and their impact on the temperature distribution. After the thermal studies, mechanical analysis of the TBM first wall, based on a simplified model was performed. FE simulations as well as theoretical approaches have been compared. The obtained stresses have been compared with the allowable stress limits prescribed by SDC-IC ITER structural codes...|$|E
40|$|The project 'Strength and {{fracture}} behaviour of branch {{connections and}} elbows under internal pressure load and superimposed external bending moment' (BV IV) {{was carried out}} at MPA Stuttgart from 1989 to 1993. The objective of the project BV IV was to extend the foundations for a safety-relevant assessment of the main coolant pipes (MCP) of primary systems of pressurized water reactors (PWR). This was made by enhancing the state of knowledge of the load bearing behaviour (stress state) {{as well as the}} failure and fracture behaviour (crack initiation, crack propagation, leak-before-break) of degraded branch connections (T-branches) and elbows. The manufacture and design of the T-branches and elbows was performed according to the conditions in the plants KWO, KKS, KWB A, GKN- 1, KKU and KWB B. The dimensions corresponded to those of the main <b>coolant</b> <b>pipe,</b> resp. to the T-branch of the surge line. The T-branches and Elbows were on the one hand made of the material 20 MnMoNi 5 5 (upper shelf impact energy C_v, _t_r_a_n_s_v_e_r_s_e > 150 J) {{and on the other hand}} of a MnMoNiV-special melt (upper shelf impact energy C_v, _t_r_a_n_s_v_e_r_s_e #approx# 50 J). Both materials dispose of comparable strength properties. The loads applied during the tests covered the loading types and levels occurring in the plants as well as those postulated for accidents. In the case of the T-branches the flaws were applied on the inside of the nozzle corner shaped as a quarter-elliptical nozzle corner flaw longitudinal to the run pipe axis, in the case of the elbows the flaws (spark eroded notches, prefatigue cracks) were applied longitudinally on the inside in the area of the bend flanks. The flaw size was chosen in a way to be definitely found by nondestructive examination methods. Five tests with T-branches consisting of a run pipe with set-on nozzle and six tests with 90 elbows were carried out. An external bending moment (in the case of elbows in-plane bending moment with opening mode, in the case of T-branches in-plane at the branch pipe) was applied reaching maximum load resp. until occurrence of leakage (quasistatic load, in the case of elbows also pulsating load). This took place in the tests after attaining the test temperature (temperature of the upper shelf impact energy, for one T-branch made of the special melt the test temperature corresponded to the transitional range of the C_v-T-curve with T 30 C) as well as the static internal pressure (operational pressure, exception one test with T-branch with p_i = 11 MPa).

40|$|The {{design of}} {{engineering}} systems, involving two-phase flow, such as nuclear water reactors, requires {{the ability to}} model and predict the detailed behavior of those flows and the phenomena that they manifest, with a required degree of accuracy. In the past {{a significant amount of}} effort has been addressed to the development of intrusive and nonintrusive measurement techniques of two-phase flows, with special application to the determination of mass flow rates. Many extensive experiments are being performed to investigate in detail loss of coolant accidents (LOCA). During these experiments the coolant is released as a two-phase mixture through a simulated break of a <b>coolant</b> <b>pipe,</b> and the measurement of the mass flow rate of the two phases was required to analyze the accident evolution and consequences. In this context, most flow meters have been designed to measure the single-phase flow of a Newtonian fluid, and then used to measure quantities in more complex fluids. The key to fundamental understanding of two-phase flow is still the careful development of specialized instrumentation, in particular for special and complex geometrical applications. Within the framework of an Italian R&D program on Nuclear Fission, supported by the Ministry of Economic Development, the SPES 3 experimental facility, able to simulate the innovative small and medium size PWR nuclear reactors, is being built and will be operated at SIET Company laboratories. In such facility some design and beyond design basis accidents, like LOCAs, with and without the emergency heat removal systems, will be simulated. In most accident simulations, a two-phase flow mixture will occur in the lines, during the transient evolution, due to the simulated strong depressurization of the system. An accurate accident analysis requires the measurement of the mixture mass flow rate and for this reason, instruments and methodologies to evaluate different two-phase flow parameters need to be developed. Typically a set of instruments (Spool Piece - SP) must be installed in order to evaluate the mass flow rate of the phases in a large range of flow patterns, pressures and temperatures. An ideal SP is a control volume constituted by different measurement instruments, fed with a two-phase flow. In single-phase flow, each instrument is able to measure a well defined flow parameter, while the instrument signal interpretation, in two-phase flow, is not easy due to the different flow patterns and the to the large number of parameters that influence the flow, so that a model of the SP, depending on the geometry and on the SP orientation, is required. Moreover the selection of the instruments strongly depends on the experimental conditions: pressure, temperature and phases velocities. The thesis work consists in the development of special instrumentation and in the development of models, based on the analysis of experimental data, that are able to interpret the measurement signals for many possible two-phase conditions. The two different measurement fields, internal flow structure investigation and instrument modeling for phases mass flow rate reconstruction purposes, have been analyzed. In the first field the instrumentation must be able to characterize momentum, mass, energy balance with a resolution sufficient to investigate local phenomena and characteristic structure (interface evolution, void profiles, liquid film level, characteristic frequencies, etc [...] ). The investigation of an horizontal two-phase flow has been performed by means of a Wire Mesh Sensor. Local, chordal, cross-section void fraction values are derived from the sensor data {{in a wide range of}} phases superficial velocities, and a new signal methodology, able to characterize the flow in terms of phases distribution (flow patterns) and time evolution, has been developed. Moreover the methodology allows the extraction of important flow information, such as the local and time average void fraction, the interface evolution, and characteristic frequencies. The evolution of the void fraction profiles has been related to the superficial velocity of the two-phases (Jg and Jl) and the flow evolution in time and space has been analyzed and discussed, showing that such methodology is useful to identify and characterize in detail the two-phase flow. Concerning the second measurement field, the analysis of the instruments used for two-phase flow measurement applications has been described. This bibliographic research allowed the definition of the candidate instruments suitable to be installed in a nuclear safety experimental facility, and their measurement characteristics. The selection of the candidate instruments has been made defining some fundamental criteria that should be satisfied: range of measurement, dynamic response, installation requirements, materials/electrical compatibility with pressure and temperature conditions, flow velocity compatibility. The selected instruments have been experimentally studied in different pipe configurations, and different models have been developed for each one. Different instrument combinations have been tested, and the performance of each one has been analyzed in terms of estimation of the mass flow rate of the two phases. The performed research allows the identification of the advantage and drawbacks of the different instrument combinations, and the identification of the phases mass flow rate measurement accuracy achievable for each SP configuratio...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLocalized {{corrosion}} of cast {{duplex stainless}} steel Z 3 CN 20. 09 M, which used widely in primary <b>coolant</b> <b>pipes</b> {{of nuclear power}} plants, has been investigated after thermally aged at 400 °C for 100, 300, 1000 and 3000 h by making use of electrochemical method. Double loop electrochemical potentiodynamic reactivation (DL-EPR) and potentiodynamic polarization tests were used for assessing intergranular corrosion (IGC), pitting and general corrosion resistance, respectively. The experimental {{results showed that the}} general corrosion resistance of Z 3 CN 20. 09 M did not change almost with increase of thermal aging time, however, IGC and pitting corrosion resistance decreased. In the polarization curves, the peak anodic current density of general corrosion was not found to change almost with increase of thermal aging time, but DL-EPR results showed that the value of Ir/Ia increased. The deterioration in localized corrosion resistance of thermally aged specimen was directly related to the precipitation of alpha prime phase in ferrite by spinodal decomposition...|$|R

50|$|The first {{launch of}} the ECA variant on 11 December 2002 ended in failure when a main booster problem caused the rocket to veer off-course, forcing its self-destruction three minutes into the flight. Its payload of two {{communications}} satellites (Stentor and Hot Bird 7), valued at about EUR 630 million, {{was lost in the}} ocean. The fault was determined to have been caused by a leak in <b>coolant</b> <b>pipes</b> allowing the nozzle to overheat. After this failure, Arianespace SA delayed the expected January 2003 launch for the Rosetta mission to 26 February 2004, but this was again delayed to early March 2004 due to a minor fault in the foam that protects the cryogenic tanks on the Ariane 5. As of June 2017, the failure of the first ECA launch was the last failure of an Ariane 5; since then, all subsequent launches have been successful, with 80 consecutive successes that stretch back to 9 April 2003 with the launch of INSAT-3A and Galaxy 12 satellites.|$|R
