5000|$|<b>Cyclopentolate</b> is a {{medication}} commonly used during pediatric eye examinations that dilates the eye (mydriatic), prevents accommodation {{of the eye}} to different distances (cycloplegic), and blocks specific receptors called muscarinic receptors (muscarinic antagonist). [...] <b>Cyclopentolate</b> is also administered as an atropine substitute to reverse muscarinic and central nervous system effects of indirect cholinomimetic (anti-AChase) administration.|$|E

50|$|Important muscarinic antagonists include atropine, Hyoscyamine, hyoscine butylbromide and hydrobromide, ipratropium, tropicamide, <b>cyclopentolate,</b> and pirenzepine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyclopentolate</b> drops act {{rapidly to}} dilate the pupil. They have a shorter {{half-life}} than atropine. Pupil dilation can {{last up to}} 96 hours, with patients advised not to drive a vehicle or operate machinery for at least 12 hours. The pupils become wider when <b>cyclopentolate</b> is administered, making the eyes more sensitive to light. Close objects (and possibly distant objects) will also appear blurred.|$|E

50|$|Cycloplegic {{drugs are}} {{generally}} muscarinic receptor blockers. These include atropine, <b>cyclopentolate,</b> homatropine, scopolamine and tropicamide. They are indicated {{for use in}} cycloplegic refraction (to paralyze the ciliary muscle {{in order to determine}} the true refractive error of the eye) and the treatment of uveitis.

5000|$|Cycloplegia is {{paralysis}} of the {{ciliary muscle}} of the eye, {{resulting in a}} loss of accommodation. [...] Because of the paralysis of the ciliary muscle, the curvature of the lens can no longer be adjusted to focus on nearby objects. This results in similar problems as those caused by presbyopia, in which the lens has lost elasticity and can also no longer focus on close-by objects. Cycloplegia with accompanying mydriasis (dilation of pupil) is usually due to topical application of muscarinic antagonists such as atropine and <b>cyclopentolate.</b>|$|E

Various parameters {{involved in the}} enantioseparation such as the type and the concentration of chiral selectors, pH value and {{a wide range of}} organic solvents were investigated. The maximum enantioselec-tivity (a = 2. 13) and optimum distribution coefficients (KR = 0. 85, KS = 0. 40) were obtained under the following conditions: 0. 10 mol/L HP-b-CD in aqueous phase and 0. 20 mol/L D-tartaric acid ditertbutyl ester in decanol as organic phase. <b>Cyclopentolate</b> is present as a racemic mixture to the aqueous phase.

40|$|SUMMARY <b>Cyclopentolate</b> 1 % is {{significantly}} less effective than atropine 1 % at producing cycloplegia in 1 -year-old children. If cycloplegic refraction {{is to be}} used for investigation or screening children for visual defects during the sensitive period, the more prolonged and profound cycloplegia following atropine could potentially have a disastrous effect on the development of vision. <b>Cyclopentolate</b> 1 % would have to be used, and allowance made for its inadequacy as a cycloplegic. The feasibility study of screening 1 -year-old children (Ingram et al., 1979) was followed up and extended into adjacent parts of this district using atropine 1 % and <b>cyclopentolate</b> 1 % for cycloplegia. If retinoscopy after cycloplegia {{is to be used}} for further investi-gation of the possibility of preventing amblyopia and squint, and if it is ever to become a recognised method of screening large numbers of infants for visual defects, the choice of cycloplegic drug might be important. The advantages and disadvantages of atropine and <b>cyclopentolate,</b> the 2 drugs that are probably most commonly used, need to be compared, particularly with regard to (1) their efficiency as a cycloplegic; (2) their side effects and safety; (3) whether the mothers had a preference for one or the other, because it is no good having an efficient screening test if the public cannot be persuaded to use it.

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} on 10 g/L <b>cyclopentolate</b> and 10 g/L atropine on cycloplegia in children before optometry. METHODS: Eighty eyes of 40 children among 4 - 12 {{years old with}} refractive error were recruited in this study. 10 g/L <b>cyclopentolate</b> eye drops were topically administered once per 5 min for 3 times and optometry was performed after 45 min. Three days after that, 10 g/L atropine sulfate eye gel then was used 3 times per day for consecutive 3 d and again the refractive diopter was obtained at the 4 th d. The differences of the results in retinoscopy refraction were compared between 10 g/L <b>cyclopentolate</b> eye drops and 10 g/L atropine sulfate eye gel. RESULTS: Therefraction results of those given 10 g/L <b>cyclopentolate</b> eye drops and 10 g/L atropine sulfate eye gel were no statistical different in both 4 - 8 years group and 9 - 12 years group with myopia(≤- 3. 00 D) (P = 0. 411, 0. 924). The differences of refraction results of both the drugs were significant in 4 - 8 years group with low hypermetropia, medium hypermetropia and high hypermetropia(P = 0. 007, 0. 007, 0. 009).

40|$|Recently, a {{population}} of nerves has been described in the aganglionic mouse vas deferens, in which electrically evoked contractions were insensitive to high concentrations of the adrenergic neurone blocker, bretylium. In this paper, the pharmacology of this nerve-evoked contraction has been examined in more detail. Bretylium (20 [*]μM) revealed, after 5 [*]h exposure, a new residual neurogenic contraction (20 stimuli at 10 [*]Hz) that was tetrodotoxin-sensitive. The muscarinic antagonist, <b>cyclopentolate</b> (0. 1 and 1 [*]μM), reduced this residual component and the inhibition was reversed by the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, neostigmine (1 and 10 [*]μM). Nicotine (30 [*]μM) enhanced the residual component revealed by bretylium, suggesting that there are prejunctional nicotinic receptors (nAchRs) influencing acetylcholine (Ach) release. In the presence of prazosin (0. 1 [*]μM), a selective α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist, and α,β-methylene ATP (1 [*]μM), a purinergic agonist that desensitise P 2 X receptors, neostigmine increased the hump component of contraction and yohimbine (0. 3 [*]μM), an α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, enhanced both components of the electrically evoked stimulation. The contraction was blocked by <b>cyclopentolate</b> (1 [*]μM). In the absence of bretylium, neostigmine alone increased the hump component of contraction in a frequency-dependent manner. This increase was reversed by atropine (1 [*]μM) and <b>cyclopentolate</b> (1 [*]μM) to control levels. However, in control experiments, atropine or <b>cyclopentolate</b> did not detectably influence the delayed neurogenic contraction. Ach (10 [*]μM) induced a contraction in the mouse vas deferens, either when applied alone or {{in the presence of}} neostigmine. Thus, it has been demonstrated unequivocally that the mouse vas deferens is innervated by functional cholinergic nerves, whose action is terminated by cholinesterase.

40|$|Background: In {{order to}} perform {{cataract}} surgery, adequate dilatation of the pupil is essential. This is traditionally achieved by preoperative topical mydriatic eye-drops, commonly <b>cyclopentolate</b> and phenylephrine. This routine has several disadvantages. First, the slow penetration through the cornea delays {{the onset of}} mydriasis. Second, the limited bioavailability of topically administered substances with significant systemic absorption may increase the risk for systemic side effects. Third, even if good mydriasis is achieved initially with topical mydriatics (TM), the effect tends to wear off during surgery. In relation to cataract surgery a transient postoperative corneal oedema is sometimes noted, indicating effects on the corneal endothelial pump function. These effects have been ascribed to ultrasonic or mechanical trauma from the phacoemulsification procedure. Corneal endothelial cell loss (ECL) is a commonly studied variable, not least because it {{is associated with the}} long-term risk for corneal decompensation. But, there has been a debate whether postoperative corneal swelling after phacoemulsification cataract surgery correlates to ECL. Aims: To evaluate an alternative mydriatic regimen for phacoemulsification cataract surgery: intracameral injection of mydriatics mixed with lidocaine (ICM). Additionally, to determine the correlation between early transient postoperative corneal oedema and permanent ECL after phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Methods: Pupil dilatation with ICM (150 µl of lidocaine 1 %, phenylephrine 1. 5 %, and <b>cyclopentolate</b> 0. 1 %) was compared to TM (phenylephrine 10 % and <b>cyclopentolate</b> 1 %) prior to cataract surgery. Additionally, two ICM-groups were randomized to receive either 0. 6 µg/ml epinephrine added to the irrigating balanced salt solution or no epinephrine in the irrigation solution. Furthermore, two randomized ICM-groups, with or without <b>cyclopentolate,</b> were analyzed. The patients planned for cataract surgery were examined with ultrasonic pachymetry, specular microscope endothelial photography and Orbscan II slit-scan tomography pre- and postoperatively. Results: With ICM, mydriasis reached 95 ± 3 % of its final value within 20 seconds. In the ICM-group, the pupils were smaller than in the TM-group (mean 6. 7 ± 1. 0 mm versus 7. 7 ± 1. 0 mm, P<. 001), but did not contract intraoperatively as the TM pupils did. Conversely, with ICM the pupil sizes generally increased during the cataract procedures. This increase was significantly greater without epinephrine in the irrigating solution (13 ± 19 % versus 4 ± 14 %; p = 0. 02). No significant differences in pupil sizes were observed between the patients who were given ICM with or without <b>cyclopentolate.</b> The central corneal swelling at the first postoperative day was strongly correlated to the central ECL at 3 months, R 2 = 0. 785, P < 0. 001. Conclusions: ICM is a rapid and safe alternative to TM in phacoemulsification cataract surgery. An irrigating solution without epinephrine can safely be used with ICM. <b>Cyclopentolate,</b> administrated intracamerally, has no immediate additive mydriatic effect to intracameral lidocaine combined with phenylephrine.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} topically applied 1 % <b>cyclopentolate</b> hydrochloride on anterior segment parameters obtained with a Pentacam rotating Scheimpflug camera in healthy young adults. Methods: Anterior segment analyses of 25 eyes from 25 young adults (Group 1), before and after 45 min of 1 % <b>cyclopentolate</b> hydrochloride application, were performed. For a control group (cycloplegia-free, Group 2), 24 eyes of 24 age- and sex-matched healthy cases were evaluated twice at 45 min intervals. The results obtained from the groups were compared statistically. Results: The mean ages of the groups were 23. 04 &# 177; 3. 42 (range, 18 - 29) and 22. 4 &# 177; 2. 05 (range, 18 - 27) years for Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p= 0. 259). In Group 1, measurements between the two analyses were significantly different for the values of anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber angle (ACA), and anterior chamber volume (ACV) (p< 0. 05), whereas no statistical difference was found for the central corneal thickness (CCT) and keratometry (K 1, K 2) measurements. In Group 2, none of these parameters were statistically different between the two analyses.

Atropine, though the gold standard cycloplegic agent for refraction in children, has a long duration of action and more severe side effects compared to short-acting cycloplegic agents. The aim {{of the study was}} to compare the cycloplegic effect of atropine with <b>cyclopentolate</b> and tropicamide combination in children with hypermetropia. Subjects and Methods: This was a crossover interventional study in children with hypermetropia. Cycloplegic refraction using two separate regimens of cycloplegic drugs was done on all subjects. Data were analyzed using the statistical software SPSS version 22. 0. The mean spherical equivalent values of regimen 1 (atropine 1 %) and regimen 2 (<b>cyclopentolate</b> 1 % and tropicamide 1 %) were presented as mean and standard deviation. A P ≤ 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: One hundred and twenty-six eyes of 63 subjects aged 5 - 12 years were examined. The mean spherical equivalent values for regimen 1 and regimen 2 for the right eyes were 4. 73 ± 2. 1 DS and 4. 54 ± 1. 9 DS, respectively (P = 0. 59). The mean spherical equivalent values for regimens 1 and 2 for the left eyes were 4. 74 ± 2. 0 DS and 4. 54 ± 1. 8 DS, respectively (P = 0. 56). Conclusion: The combination of 1 % <b>cyclopentolate</b> and 1 % tropicamide could be a useful alternative to atropine 1 % for cycloplegic refraction in children with hypermetropia...|$|E
