5000|$|Chocolate chip {{cookie dough}} baked {{in a baking}} dish instead of a <b>cookie</b> <b>sheet</b> results in a {{chocolate}} chip bar cookie.|$|E
50|$|A sheet pan {{that has}} a {{continuous}} lip around all four sides may be called a jelly roll pan. A pan {{that has a}}t least one side flat, so that it is easy to slide the baked product off the end, may be called a <b>cookie</b> <b>sheet.</b>|$|E
50|$|Roskette {{dough is}} {{historically}} rolled into a log {{the size and}} length of a pencil. The dough is either formed into a coil, or into a pretzel. Some shape {{the dough into a}} ball then flatten the dough with the tines of a fork. The cookies are baked on a greased <b>cookie</b> <b>sheet</b> till moderately or lightly browned.|$|E

50|$|A sheet pan, {{baking tray}} or baking sheet is a flat, {{rectangular}} metal pan {{used in an}} oven. It is often used for baking bread rolls, pastries and flat products such as <b>cookies,</b> <b>sheet</b> cakes, swiss rolls and pizzas.|$|R
5000|$|To dry the material, {{silica gel}} is spread on open pans or <b>cookie</b> <b>sheets</b> in a layer ½ to ¾ inch thick. Materials to be {{preserved}} are then baked in an oven at 250˚Celsius for about an hour, or until the moisture-indicating crystals, if present, are blue again. Material is then stirred several times while drying.|$|R
5000|$|Jessamine Shumate {{was also}} famous {{for some of}} her unusual works. One of the most {{interesting}} was a burned <b>cookie</b> <b>sheet.</b> [...] "Mrs. Jessamine Shumate... is perhaps the only local artist to use a burned <b>cookie</b> <b>sheet</b> and a blow torch to do some of her painting." [...] And another writer from Roanoke said: [...] "When it come to experimental material {{it is quite possible that}} Jessamine Shumate takes some kind of cake for painting on a <b>cookie</b> <b>sheet.</b> For me this is actually one of the most delightful items in the show. No one would guess that her bright, “Pebbly Abstract No. 3” is the result of a near kitchen disaster. Jim Yeatts, gallery owner, tells us that the artist left the cookie tin in the oven too long one day and tried desperately to get it clean. When it didn’t begin to shine properly, she decided to paint it and frame it. “Cookie Sheet”, done in “mixed media”, is a delightful addition to the show. It may also be some sort of inspiration to other kitchen artists, who prefer paint brushes to scouring pads." [...] The art piece is an example of “Found art”, in that it is presented by the artist as a work of art, but the object was originally designed for a non-art function. Jessamine Shumate had taken something that was “found” and made it into another, more artistic, representation.|$|E
5000|$|Spoons {{are also}} {{widely used in}} cooking and serving. In baking, batter is usually thin enough to pour or drop from a spoon; a mixture of such {{consistency}} is sometimes called [...] "drop batter”. Rolled dough dropped from a spoon to a <b>cookie</b> <b>sheet</b> can be made into rock cakes and other cookies, while johnnycake may be prepared by dropping spoonfuls of cornmeal onto a hot greased griddle.|$|E
50|$|Thermal inertia {{measurement}} is a remote-sensing {{technique that}} allows scientists to distinguish fine-grained from coarse-grained {{areas on the}} Martian surface. Thermal inertia {{is a measure of}} how fast or slow something heats up or cools off. For example, metals have very low thermal inertia. An aluminum <b>cookie</b> <b>sheet</b> taken out of an oven is cool to the touch in less than a minute; while a ceramic plate (high thermal inertia) taken from the same oven takes much longer to cool off.|$|E
50|$|The {{kitchen is}} {{supplied}} with dishes, cutlery, utensils, {{pots and pans}} and bake ware (including roasting pans, <b>cookie</b> <b>sheets,</b> bread pans and muffin pans). There is a full size propane oven, {{as well as some}} two-burner propane stoves for cooking. The hut is lit by several propane lights. Propane is supplied by the Alpine Club via a large outdoor tank.|$|R
50|$|The {{kitchen is}} well {{supplied}} with dishes, cutlery, utensils, {{pots and pans}} and bake ware (including roasting pans, <b>cookie</b> <b>sheets,</b> coffee percolator, bread pans and muffin pans). There is a full size propane oven, {{as well as some}} two-burner propane stoves for cooking. Propane is supplied by the Alpine Club via a large outdoor tank. Drinking water is available from a small stream fed by Kiwetinok lake (a day hike) running through the meadow 60 m south of the hut. It is advisable to boil or treat the water before drinking it. In the winter you can dig down to the creek or melt snow for water.|$|R
50|$|Maud Lewis {{accompanied}} {{her husband on}} his daily rounds peddling fish, bringing along Christmas cards that she had drawn. She would sell the cards for twenty five cents each. These cards proved popular with her husband's customers as he sold fish door-to-door and encouraged her to begin painting. She started painting on various other surfaces such as pulp boards (beaverboards), <b>cookie</b> <b>sheets,</b> and Masonite. Lewis was a prolific artist and painted on more or less every available surface in their tiny home: walls, doors, breadboxes, and even the stove. She completely covered the simple patterned commercial wallpaper with sinewy stems, leaves, and blossoms. Everett encouraged Lewis to paint, and he bought her her first set of oils.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the ratio}} of {{ingredients}} and mixing and cooking times, some recipes are optimized to produce a softer, chewy style cookie while others will produce a crunchy/crispy style. Regardless of ingredients, the procedure for making the cookie is fairly consistent in all recipes: First, the sugars and fat are creamed, usually {{with a wooden spoon}} or electric mixer. Next, the eggs and vanilla extract are added followed by the flour and leavening agent. Depending on the additional flavoring, its addition to the mix will be determined by the type used: peanut butter will be added with the wet ingredients while cocoa powder would be added with the dry ingredients. The titular ingredient, chocolate chips, as well as nuts are typically mixed in {{towards the end of the}} process to minimize breakage, just before the cookies are scooped and positioned on a <b>cookie</b> <b>sheet.</b> Most cookie dough is baked, although some eat the dough as is, or use it as an addition to vanilla ice cream to make chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.|$|E
5000|$|The early {{peanut butter}} cookies were rolled thin {{and cut into}} shapes. They were also dropped and made into balls. They did not have fork marks. The first {{reference}} to the famous criss-cross marks created with fork tines {{was published in the}} Schenectady Gazette on July 1, 1932. The Peanut Butter Cookies recipe said [...] "Shape into balls and after placing them on the <b>cookie</b> <b>sheet,</b> press each one down with a fork, first one way and then the other, so they look like squares on waffles." [...] Pillsbury, one of the large flour producers, popularized the use of the fork in the 1930s. The Peanut Butter Balls recipe in the 1933 edition of Pillsbury's Balanced Recipes instructed the cook to press the cookies using fork tines. The 1932 or 1933 recipes do not explain why this advice is given, though: peanut butter cookie dough is dense, and without being pressed, it will not cook evenly. Using a fork to press the dough is a convenience; bakers can also use a cookie shovel.|$|E
50|$|The barftending {{treatment}} finishes up {{with five}} players {{who did not}} quit. The guests then get sleep; an hour and eleven minutes of it. They were then asked how long {{they thought they were}} sleeping. Based on how close their guesses were to the actual amount of time they slept decided how many guns they received in the first test of this season. The test had them choosing another guest who would then use one of their guns and shoot themselves. Everyone had one gun filled with fake blood, and the rest were filled with water. If they were chosen by a player, then they had to randomly choose a gun and shoot themselves. If the guest shoots itself with fake blood, he/she is eliminated from the test and the guest who made the selection gets to choose again. Last two guests had to choose between five new guns and the last person standing wins the test. Val then released a fact about every guest, and asked each player based on that fact, if the guest should be rewarded or punished. If they got more votes for a reward, then they got a slice of pizza. If they got more votes for punish, then they got sirens. Lastly the guests went into their next treatment. They had an assortment of items that they had to slap themselves with such as a toy hand, <b>cookie</b> <b>sheet,</b> baseball bat, & a spatula to make a sound meter go into the red zone. Guests were also given baby oil to reduce the pain from the slaps but also lowers sound friction. If they didn't complete a round, they had to smack themselves in the butt with a hard wooden paddle within a time limit.|$|E
5000|$|Cookie cutting sheet: Used {{for larger}} volumes, a {{production}} <b>cookie</b> cutting <b>sheet</b> {{is a piece}} of study plastic the size of a full sheet pan that essentially has dozens of cutout cookie cutters mounted on to it. [...] Rather than rolling out the dough and pressing the cutter into the top of the dough, the cutting sheet is placed of the baking sheet, cutting side up. A <b>sheet</b> of <b>cookie</b> dough, already rolled to the correct thickness, is laid on top of the cutting sheet, and a rolling pin is used to press the dough down on to the sharp edges of the cutting <b>sheet.</b> The cut <b>cookies</b> fall through the holes into the sheet, into their properly spaced positions on the baking sheet. The scrap dough and cutting sheet are removed, and the pan is ready for baking. <b>Cookie</b> cutter <b>sheets</b> allow high volume production without the time or risk of moving cut <b>cookies</b> to baking <b>sheets,</b> resulting in rapid production of a more uniformly shaped and spaced product.|$|R
5000|$|A {{baking stone}} is a {{portable}} cooking surface used in baking. They {{may be made}} of ceramic, stone, or more recently, salt. [...] Food is put on the baking stone, which is then placed in the oven, though sometimes the stone is heated first. Baking stones are used much like <b>cookie</b> <b>sheets,</b> but may absorb additional moisture for crispier food. Due to the thermal mass of baking stones and the material's property as a poor heat conductor, food {{is less likely to}} burn when using a baking stone than when using metal or glass bakeware. Baking stones are a variation on hot stone cooking {{which is one of the}} oldest cooking techniques known. Baking [...] "stones" [...] may be purchased as unglazed ceramic tiles, unglazed fired clay tiles and quarried tiles, very cheaply from tile shops and hardware stores.|$|R
5000|$|Kitchens today. Modern kitchen {{design has}} {{improved}} {{partly as a}} result of ergonomic research. Functionality is important; one research study had [...] "anthropological scientists" [...] observing homeowners [...] "interact" [...] with their kitchen cabinets. Kitchens are larger and have more cabinets; some kitchens may have as many as fifty drawers and cabinet doors. New features today include deep drawers for cookware, pull-out shelves to avoid excess bending, sponge trays on the front of sink cabinets, pullout hideaway garbage/recycling containers, pull-out spice cabinets, lazy susans in corner cabinets, vertical storage for <b>cookie</b> <b>sheets,</b> full-extension drawer slides, and drawers and doors with so-called soft-close/positive-close mechanisms enabling drawers to shut quietly, or which shut fully after being pushed only partially. As housing stocks get older, many homeowners face problems with visually unappealing older kitchen cabinets; in such situations, there is a choice to buy new (most expensive), reface existing (less expensive), or to strip and refinish existing (least expensive if done by the homeowner) cabinets. By 2009, there was more emphasis on cabinets designed with environmental factors in mind. So-called [...] "green cabinets" [...] were becoming more popular. As homes in Western countries became more airtight to save on heating and cooling costs, air quality has sometimes suffered as gases which are released from resins as they cure. Resins, organic materials which convert from liquid to solid form, are used to manufacture engineered wood (e.g., particleboard) frequently used to build kitchen cabinet carcases can be a factor.

40|$|Objectives: Experiment with thermal convection. Illustrate how {{thermal energy}} (heat) can {{generate}} motion (flow) in a fluid. The thermal convection {{in this model}} {{is similar to the}} convection that is inferred for the Earth's mantle. Convection can produce horizontal flow that can cause (or is related to) plate motions. Investigate the viscosity of a fluid and illustrate that the Earth's mantle {{can be thought of as}} a solid for short duration processes (such as the propagation of seismic waves), and as a very viscous fluid for long duration processes (such as mantle convection and plate tectonic movements).

40|$|According to Clark’s (1996) {{joint action}} hypothesis, {{language}} use fundamentally involves {{the coordination of}} individual linguistic acts and broader joint actions between participants of a usage event. Although this view on language as resonating on both psychological and social processes may seem uncontroversial to usage-based models such as cognitive linguistics (CL), the social-interactional dimension of language use is traditionally relegated to the periphery in cognitive research (Kemmer & Barlow 2000 : ix; Deppermann 2002; Tummers et al. 2005). Only recently, {{a number of studies}} in cognitive-functional linguistics have started to explore the cognitive structure and interpersonal dynamics of interactional discourse in response to a growing appeal within CL to extend its scope of investigation towards authentic, multi-agent discourse (Langacker 2001; Dirven 2005; Deppermann 2007). One of the key features of multi-agent discourse that provides a valuable gateway to the cognitive-social underpinnings of joint actions is the establishment of structural mapping relations across turns in a conversational setting, as described in the model of ‘dialogic syntax’ (Du Bois 2001, 2003; Sakita 2006). Whereas traditional linear syntax describes structural relations within single sentences, dialogic syntax deals with structural similarities between immediately co-present segments in a broader conversational context. A key concept of this model is resonance, which is defined as the ‘activation of intrinsic potential affinity across instances of dialogic language use’ (Du Bois 2001 : 8). In the present paper, we zoom in on two dimensions of resonance activation that have not been fully developed in dialogic syntax: (i) the creative cognitive processes involved in establishing cross-turn mapping relations, and (ii) the interpersonal aims and effects of resonance activation in multi-agent discourse. The example in (1) illustrates the potential of resonating structure for communicative, creative and interpersonal purposes (acknowledgment, disagreement, irony, etc.) : (1) Marci: [(TSK) Don’t forget] to buy yourself a <b>cookie</b> <b>sheet,</b> [...] before you go to make cookies Kevin: [And don’t forget] to take the Tupperware out of the oven, Wendy: you] [...] Kevin: before you turn it on (Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English, Pt I, Appease the Monster) (Sakita 2006 : 470) In order to systematically analyze the impact of creative and humorous resonance activation, we conducted a qualitative and quantitative corpus study, {{on the basis of the}} Corinth Corpus (Corpus Interactional Humor), a newly compiled Dutch corpus of spontaneous interactions. First, we show how the technique of lexical chaining can be used to automatically retrieve cross-turn resonance patterns in multi-agent discourse settings. Second, on the basis of the output of the corpus retrieval technique we propose a typology of creative resonance phenomena. We show how speakers opportunistically reframe linguistic input at different levels of linguistic representation, exploring the vast potential of language in its semantic and sociocommunicative function. status: publishe...|$|E
