50|$|The Somers <b>Cove</b> <b>Light</b> was a screw-pile {{lighthouse}} {{located near}} Crisfield, Maryland. Dismantled early, its remains are a landmark to watermen in the area.|$|E
50|$|Lighting specialists {{recommend}} installing <b>cove</b> <b>lighting</b> {{at least}} 18 {{in from the}} ceiling and 6 ft from the floor. In kitchens, <b>cove</b> <b>lights</b> can be installed {{on the top of}} kitchen cabinets. Luminaire strips should overlap the tubes to reduce the shadow effect at the lamp ends.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cove</b> <b>lighting</b> {{is a form}} of {{indirect}} lighting built into ledges, recesses, or valences in a ceiling or high on the walls of a room. It directs light up towards the ceiling and down adjacent walls. It may be used as primary lighting, or for aesthetic accent, especially to highlight decorative ceilings. <b>Cove</b> <b>lighting</b> is valued because it hides the fixtures, and because it provides a very even, warm light.|$|R
50|$|One {{method of}} {{installing}} <b>cove</b> <b>lighting</b> is by using T5 fluorescent tubes. T5 luminaires are an energy-efficient alternative to larger luminaires (such as T8 lamps) because they save on materials. An even better energy-efficient {{alternative is to}} use LED strips, mounted on an aluminium profiles for optimum heat dissipation, with prismatic covers. With a dimming controller (either analog 1..10V controls or digital, DALI based), the <b>cove</b> <b>lighting</b> can be dimmed. A wide range of LEDs are available, from warm white, daylight and even colour changing RGB modules.|$|R
5000|$|The Tarpaulin <b>Cove</b> <b>Light</b> is a {{historic}} lighthouse on Naushon Island, one of the Elizabeth Islands of southern Massachusetts. It {{is located in the}} town of Gosnold, Massachusetts. Built on the site of a light station first established privately in the 18th century, the current tower dates from 1891. A keeper's house built at the same time has not survived. The light is 78 ft above Mean High Water, and its white light is visible for [...]|$|E
50|$|Anna Flyover {{has been}} beautified with other {{elements}} such as water fountains, landscaping of its 24000 sq ft traffic islands, <b>cove</b> <b>lighting</b> under the traffic movement area, restoration of the horse statue, a toilet for the police personnel, murals depicting social messages, and so forth.|$|R
50|$|David McBeath (1860 - 1872) {{of all the}} {{fascinating}} stories the Isle of <b>Coves</b> <b>Light</b> station has to tell, nothing compares with the drama of David Mc Beath and his family running out of food with the lake already freezing. Provisions finally arrived on a steamship before they starved.|$|R
50|$|This long {{lifetime}} {{has created}} a practical market for neon use for interior architectural <b>cove</b> <b>lighting</b> {{in a wide variety}} of uses including homes, where the tube can be bent to any shape, fitted in a small space, and can do so without requiring tube replacement for a decade or more.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Cove</b> Point <b>Light</b> is a {{lighthouse}} {{located on the}} west side of the Chesapeake Bay in Calvert County, Maryland, United States.|$|R
50|$|The architects {{designed}} the interior spaces to be reserved yet dramatic. The entrance lobby is both {{one and two}} stories in height and forms an irregular polygonal footprint with walls that splay outward. The space is defined by piers sheathed in black Alberene, a type of soapstone, and grey marble covers the walls. Recessed <b>cove</b> <b>lighting</b> illuminates the lobby. The first floor elevator lobbies are lit by a luminous rear wall. The elevator doors have a satin bronze finish with fluted horizontal bands.|$|R
50|$|The Warren <b>Cove</b> Range <b>Lights</b> are a set {{of range}} lights on Rocky Point, Prince Edward Island, Canada. They were built in 1907, and are still active.|$|R
40|$|The idea {{to improve}} the quality of {{lighting}} design in interior spaces has gained importance in the last years. This experimental study concentrateson the quality of lighting and the relation between lighting arrangements and perception. A room having four different lighting arrangements was prepared and the differences between the perception of the participants under each lighting arrangement was analysed. The results suggested that different lighting arrangements affect perception. Wall washing enhanced the impressions of clarity and order, <b>cove</b> <b>lighting</b> enhanced spaciousness and order and uplighting made the same space relaxing, private and pleasant...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates whether {{different}} lighting types have {{an effect}} on the visual performance of office workers. Wall washing, <b>cove</b> <b>lighting</b> and uplighting were tested as they are the most widely used lighting types in offices, after general lighting. The lighting level chosen was 275 lx. The experiments were conducted in a controlled environment with different lighting types. Ninety participants took part in three groups of thirty. The performance measurements for each group were done in different lighting sequences. The data collected were statistically analysed. The effects of age, gender and eye deficiency of the participants on performance were also investigated...|$|R
50|$|The Faulkner Planetarium {{opened in}} November, 1995, {{as the largest}} planetarium theater in Idaho, seating 144 under a 50' (15.2 m) dome. When first opened the theater {{featured}} {{one of the first}} Evans & Sutherland Digistar II digital graphics projectors, 49 random access slide projectors, three video projectors, and an 11,500 W sound system. An upgrade to an Evans and Sutherland Digistar 5 fulldome video system, LED <b>cove</b> <b>lighting,</b> a Dolby 5.1 surround sound system and an Astrofx theater control system took place in the fall of 2013. Programs are offered for school groups and the public throughout the year.|$|R
5000|$|The Bank of America Hall {{provides}} {{space for}} hosting private receptions, banquets, meetings, seminars, recitals, small tradeshows and exhibits. The 3150 sq ft. room features a barrel vaulted ceiling, <b>cove</b> <b>lighting,</b> hardwood flooring {{and a full}} range of A/V production equipment. A catering prep kitchen is located adjacent to the room to assist caterers with servicing these occasions. Depending on the setup of the room, it can hold up to 180 for a seated dinner and up to 300 for receptions. Pre/post-event activities may also be held in the Bank of America Hall in conjunction {{with the use of the}} larger performance venue.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} {{built in the}} International Style with an {{asymmetric}} shape, smooth undecorated siding, and flat roofs with a rooftop terrace. Inside there are elements of Art Moderne including rounded edges on walls and the fireplace, recessed <b>cove</b> <b>lighting,</b> built-in cabinets, a glass-block wall in the bathroom, and a round window by the front entrance. Miller designed three art pieces for the interior: a low-relief sculpture of a woman over the fireplace, a recessed decorative tile of a woman on a beach, and a metal door-pull on a built-in hallway cabinet. These objects {{were still in the}} house in 2009, when it was declared a Chicago Landmark.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Cove</b> Island <b>Light,</b> {{located near}} Tobermory {{is one of}} the six famous [...] "Imperial" [...] lighthouses built in the 1850s by John Brown which {{can be found on the}} {{mainland}} and on nearby islands of the northern Bruce Peninsula.|$|R
50|$|Passing {{through all}} {{ground-level}} rooms and {{on both sides}} of the auditorium are continuous flat <b>lighting</b> <b>coves.</b> Clad in stained plywood with an angled timber fascia, the undersides of the <b>lighting</b> <b>coves</b> are pierced by regularly spaced square lights. The ceiling above these coves is clad in perforated plywood. Other light fittings are generally circular. Throughout the building the footings of the laminated timber arches are exposed.|$|R
50|$|Right turn lanes were {{reinstated}} for westbound {{traffic at}} the intersection of Parklands Avenue and Centennial Avenue, Lane <b>Cove.</b> Street <b>lighting</b> was upgraded. As the final construction activity, Epping Road between Mowbray Road and Pacific Highway was resurfaced with new asphalt and new line marking.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} stands {{three stories}} tall and has 57000 sq ft of floorspace. [...] It is constructed of granite, limestone, slate, and copper, which {{is intended to}} match the older buildings on campus. [...] The tower element {{on the left side}} of the building is intended to match the most prominent building on campus, Old Main. [...] The 30-degree bend at one end created a [...] "cornerstone" [...] effect on the campus' northeast property line. [...] A false chimney houses mechanical equipment. [...] The entrance plaza includes a fountain and a grassed bowl area in the lower plaza. [...] The interior of the Burnett Center consists of cherry wood trim and doors, veneer plaster, wool carpet, and <b>cove</b> <b>lighting.</b> [...] The railings include cast iron fleur-de-lis balusters from Hays Hall, the first dormitory on campus that was demolished in 1994. [...] The first floor has atrium spaces and a main staircase. [...] The large vertical ribbon window assemblies provide a view of the rest of campus.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{entering}} the casino, guests see a contemporary, retro-1960s interior. <b>Light</b> <b>coves</b> between overhead vaults, back-lit fabric draped between frames, and conically shaped light fixtures create a complex, ornate ceiling above the casino floor.|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. This study explores whether {{different}} lighting arrangements (general lighting, wall washing and <b>cove</b> <b>lighting)</b> and different illuminances (500 and 320 lux) {{could affect the}} perception of the same space. An experimental study was conducted to investigate how the qualitative aspects of space (the impressions of a space) could be enhanced with lighting. Hundred participants were first asked to choose the most suitable lighting arrangement for each impression (clarity, spaciousness, relaxation, privacy, pleasantness and order) under the 500 lux illuminance. In the second stage, they were asked to compare the two illuminances (500 and 320 lux) for the lighting arrangement they selected in the first stage. There was a statistically significant relation between impressions and lighting arrangements, also between impressions and lighting levels. Thus, different lighting arrangements and lighting levels could be used to enhance the clarity, spaciousness, relaxation, privacy, pleasantness and order of a room. The results of this study found most suitable lighting arrangements with their illuminances for each impression, which is reported in the paper. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|The facade to Hay St had a {{symbolic}} skyscraper effect. There were tall strips of windows; the centre third {{was taller than}} and projected from the remainder. Stepping from the centre of this central bay was the vertical sign which projected above the roof and curved back and down into the modern ziggurat roof form. The auditorium was rather simple in fibrous plaster, striated lines and straight ceiling coves accentuated the long dimension of the room. The slightly lower sections {{each side of the}} ceiling, as well as incorporating indirect <b>lighting</b> <b>coves</b> to wash <b>light</b> across upper ceiling levels and down the walls, probably boxed in the airconditioning ducts.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Cove</b> Island <b>Light,</b> at Gig Point on the island, {{is located}} in Fathom Five National Marine Park, on the Bruce Peninsula, Ontario Canada. It has been a navigational aid in the narrow channel between Lake Huron and Georgian Bay since 30 October 1858. It {{was the first of}} six stone Imperial Towers to be completed; all were {{illuminated}} by 1859. Most other lighthouses of the era were built of brick, wood, iron or concrete.|$|R
50|$|The {{entrance}} foyer has vinyl {{floor tiles}} {{and a low}} ceiling clad in perforated panels with decorative cover strips. Round columns support the gallery above. One panel of a sliding decorative metal screen remains in its track under the <b>lighting</b> <b>cove.</b>|$|R
50|$|From 1983 to 1987, the {{convention}} center and Public Auditorium were both extensively renovated. The Exhibition Hall below Public Auditorium was radically changed, with a lobby/ballroom created out of former service space {{at the north end}} of the hall. A stone staircase was built in this area to connect the space to the hall above. This area could accommodate up to 2,000 people. The rest of the old Exhibition Hall was turned into 15 meeting rooms (ranging in size from 10 to 700 seats), office space, a cocktail lounge, and a piano bar arranged around a central block. A corridor hugged the exterior wall of the old hall, providing access to the meeting rooms. This corridor had decorative stone panels on one side and painted wood on the other, and was lined with sturdy chair upholstered in luggage fabric. The old asphalt floor was covered with concrete, and then tiled and carpeted. <b>Cove</b> <b>lighting</b> lit the corridor and meeting rooms. The Lakeside Exhibition Hall was converted into a ballroom with kitchen, and the north wall of the hall torn out and replaced with a glass curtain wall that had views of Lake Erie.|$|R
5000|$|The {{renovation}} plans {{drawn up}} by the architectural firms of Mancini•Duffy and Peter Silling & Associates called for 12 suites and 27 standard guest rooms. Additional architectural work was provided by Michael Winstanley Architects & Planners. Each guest room featured trayed ceilings, <b>cove</b> <b>lighting,</b> millwork manufactured in Europe, hardwood parquet flooring from a demolished French château, and laser-cut marble sinks, tiles, and decorative work. Each suite also had a fireplace. Each guest room was unique, with its own color and design scheme and unique furnishings (designed by Silling & Associates). Furnishings in each room included one-of-a-kind artworks; silk curtains; custom, hand-upholstered furniture; and glass-enclosed rainfall showers. Each guest room contained a television, but in suites these were mirror TVs. Anticipated hotel amenities included an indoor bar, rooftop cocktail lounge, fitness center, [...] "signature" [...] restaurant, outdoor dining area along the canal, spa, indoor and outdoor swimming pool, and wine cellar with attached wine bar. The lobby of the hotel could be accessed only by an electronic key. The lobby was designed {{to look like the}} living room of a wealthy home, with built-in bookshelves, chandelier, and floor-to-ceiling fireplace.|$|R
50|$|Along the ridgeline, {{natural light}} enters the hall through {{sections}} of translucent roof sheeting. A suspended, arched <b>light</b> <b>cove</b> partially shields {{views of the}} roof structure and five large metal ventilators along the ridgeline. The arched roof is clad with corrugated metal sheeting.|$|R
2500|$|MD 497 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 2 and MD 4, which run concurrently as Solomons Island Road, in Lusby. [...] The state highway heads east as a two-lane road and intersects the old alignment of MD 2, MD 765 (H.G. Trueman Road). [...] MD 497 continues east along Cove Point Park before intersecting Little Cove Point Road, {{which leads to}} the Chesapeake Ranch Estates community and the Chesapeake Ranch Airstrip. [...] The state highway passes by the entrance to the Cove Point Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal and through a forested area before reaching its eastern terminus {{at the entrance to the}} Cove Point community. [...] The roadway continues as county-maintained Lighthouse Boulevard to the <b>Cove</b> Point <b>Light.</b>|$|R
50|$|The front {{portion of}} the former library has been {{converted}} into an office with no early joinery remaining. The floor is carpeted and the brick walls have been lined and painted. The rear portion, accessed from inside the hall, has had modern partition walls inserted to form two store rooms. Remnant cork flooring remains attached to the concrete slab, revealing the location of original walls which enclosed a workroom and children's outdoor reading room. The original ceiling and <b>lighting</b> <b>coves</b> remain throughout.|$|R
60|$|Guy {{ran across}} the court, round to {{the west side of}} the house, and {{struggled}} up the slope in the face of the wind, which almost swept him down again; and when at length he had gained the summit, came rushing against him with such force that he could hardly stand. He did, however, keep his ground, and gazed out over the sea. The swell was fearful; marked by the silver light on one side, where it caught the moonbeams, and the black shade on the other, ever alternating, so that the eye could, not fix on them for a moment; the spray leapt high in its whiteness, and the Shag stood up hard, bold, and black. The waves thundered, bursting on the cliff and, high as he stood, the spray dashed almost blinding in his face, while the wind howled round him, as if gathering its might for the very purpose of wrenching him from the cliff; but he stood firm, and looked out again, to discern clearly what he thought he had seen. It was the mast of a vessel, seen plainly against the light silvery distance of sea on the reef west of the Shag. It was in a slanting direction, and did not move; he could not doubt that the ship had struck on the dangerous rocks at the entrance of the bay; and as his eyes became more accustomed to the unusual light, and made out what objects were or were not familiar, he could perceive the ship herself. He looked with the glass, but could see no one on board, nor were any boats in sight; but observing some of the lesser rocks, he beheld some moving figures on them. Help!--instant help!--was his thought; and he looked towards the <b>Cove.</b> <b>Lights</b> were in the cottage windows, and a few sounds came up to him, as if the fishing population were astir.|$|R
50|$|It {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{preserved}} classic diners in America, with close to 100% of the original features still intact. Key features include elaborate stainless steel ornamentation on the exterior, rounded interior ceiling with hidden <b>lighting</b> <b>cove</b> on all sides, a counter with stools and booths for patron seating, and terrazzo concrete floor. O'Mahony was one of the most significant and prolific diner manufacturing companies of all time and is often regarded as the company that set the highest standards for diner construction quality and craftsmanship. Every aspect of the structure's form and function was very carefully designed and optimized.|$|R
