During The Blitz of 1940-1941, Coventry, a British {{industrial}} city, was severely bombed by the Luftwaffe on the night of 14-15 November. There was heavy damage and numerous civilian casualties.

40|$|Objectives: Although <b>clear</b> <b>advances</b> {{have been}} {{achieved}} {{in the study of}} early-onset schizophrenia (EOS), little is known to date about premorbid and prodromal neuropsychological functioning in EOS. Method: Here, we report on a case of an adolescent male with EOS who underwent neuropsychological testing before and after illness onset. Results: Marked cognitive deficits in the domains of attention, set-shifting, and verbal memory were present both pre-onset and during the course of schizophrenia, though only deficits in verbal memory persisted after illness-onset and antipsychotic treatment. Conclusion: The findings of this case study suggest that impairments in the verbal memory domain are particularly prominent symptoms of cognitive impairment in prodromal EOS and persist {{in the course of the}} disorder, which further demonstrates the difficult clinical situation of adequate schooling opportunities for adolescent patients with EOS...|$|R
40|$|In this Seminar {{we discuss}} {{developments}} {{from the past}} 5 years in the diagnosis, neurobiology, and treatment of major depressive disorder. For diagnosis, psychiatric and medical comorbidity have been emphasised as important factors in improving the appropriate assessment and management of depression. Advances in neurobiology have also increased, and we aim to indicate genetic, molecular, and neuroimaging studies that are relevant for assessment and treatment selection of this disorder. Further studies of depression-specific psychotherapies, the continued application of antidepressants, {{the development of new}} treatment compounds, and the status of new somatic treatments are also discussed. We address two treatment-related issues: suicide risk with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and the safety of antidepressants in pregnancy.

Though the need for improved process control is <b>clear,</b> <b>advanced</b> control methodologies have had only limited acceptance and application in industrial practice. The reason for this gap between control theory and practice is that existing control methodologies do not adequately address all of the following control system requirements and problems associated with control design: ffl The controller must be insensitive to plant/model mismatch, and perform well under unmeasured or poorly modeled disturbances. ffl The controlled system must perform well under state or actuator constraints. ffl The controlled system must be safe, reliable, and easy to maintain. ffl Controllers are commonly require [...] ...|$|R
