50|$|Another {{criticism}} {{is that the}} calculation includes capital gains taxes but not capital gains income, thus overstating the tax burden. For example, in the late 1990s the US Tax Freedom Day moved later, reaching its latest date ever in 2000, but this was largely due to capital gains taxes on the bull market of that era rather than an increase in tax rates. In other words, variations in capital gains income and their associated taxes cause changes {{in the amount of}} taxes, but not in the income used in the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tax</b> Freedom Day.|$|E

50|$|A {{fiscal year}} (or {{financial}} year, or sometimes budget year) is the period used by governments for accounting and budget purposes, which vary between countries. It {{is also used}} for financial reporting by business and other organizations. Laws in many jurisdictions require company financial reports to be prepared and published on a generally annual basis, but generally do not require that the reporting period be calendar year, 1 January to 31 December. Taxation laws generally require accounting records to be maintained and taxes calculated {{on an annual basis}}, which usually corresponds to the fiscal year used for government purposes. The <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> on an annual basis is especially relevant for direct taxation, such as income tax. Many annual government fees—such as Council rates, licence fees, etc.—are also levied on a fiscal year basis, while others are charged on an anniversary basis.|$|E
