5|$|Although Beebe {{continued}} to use Nonsuch Island as his base of operations throughout the 1930s, {{with the onset of}} World War II in 1939 it was announced that the ferry linking Bermuda to New York would soon be making its final run, requiring Beebe and his team to hastily abandon their station there. Transportation to and from Bermuda resumed in 1940, and Beebe returned there in May 1941, but the environment was slowly being transformed due to the war. The large number of military ships made docking difficult, most of the island's reefs were being destroyed in order to construct an airfield, and the combination of construction activity and pollution made observation of the sea life impossible. Appalled by the destruction, Beebe finally rented his station at Nonsuch Island to a military <b>contractor</b> <b>and</b> returned to New York.|$|E

5|$|From their {{foundation}} in 2005 until 2014, F.C. United were based at Bury F.C.'s Gigg Lane stadium. F.C. United's first proposed stadium {{was announced in}} 2010 for Newton Heath, the original home of Manchester United. The development was planned to be located {{on the site of}} the Ten Acres Lane sports centre and would have cost £3.5million, to be financed by public donations, a Community Shares issue and grant funding. However a year later, in March 2011, Manchester City Council backed out from funding the stadium. The Broadhurst Park site in Moston, north-east Manchester, was announced in April 2011. Detailed information about the new facility was released in June 2011 and Manchester City Council approved the planning permission for the site on 27 October 2011. F.C. United had to overcome some obstacles including funding agreements, <b>contractor</b> <b>and</b> lease negotiations and a legal challenge from local residents which caused a further two-year delay before building commenced in November 2013.|$|E

5|$|Louise Nevelson {{was born}} Leah Berliawsky in 1899 in Perislav, Poltava Governorate, Russian Empire, to Minna Sadie and Isaac Berliawsky, a <b>contractor</b> <b>and</b> lumber merchant. Even though the family lived comfortably, Nevelson's {{relatives}} {{had begun to}} leave the Russian Empire for America in the 1880s. The Berliawskys had to stay behind, as Isaac, the youngest brother, had to care for his parents. While still in Europe, Minna gave birth to two of Nevelson's siblings: Nathan (born 1898) and Anita (1902). On his mother's death, Isaac moved to the United States in 1902. After he left, Minna and the children moved to the Kiev area. According to family lore, young Nevelson was so forlorn about her father's departure that she became mute for six months.|$|E

Other investors include relatives of Daley's political adviser Timothy Degnan, two neighbors of the mayor, Ray Chin, an O'Hare Airport <b>contractor,</b> <b>and</b> Rick Simon, a controversial figure who runs a janitorial business {{and sits on the}} board of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau.
