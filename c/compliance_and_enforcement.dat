[...] By doing so, they intend to “protect human health, particularly vulnerable populations such as children and the poor.” [...] In order to accomplish these goals in Africa, EPA programs are focused on strengthening the ability to enforce environmental laws as well as public compliance to them.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the issues arising from state <b>compliance</b> with <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> of {{international human rights}} treaty provisions. The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 1950, provides the main focus for this analysis. On the issue of state compliance with treaty provisions, this thesis explores the applicability of existing theories surrounding state compliance with international law in a specific European Convention Context. Concerning state enforcement oftreaty provisions, this thesis has been written {{at a time when}} reform of the enforcement machinery within the European Convention system is ongoing. The main component parts of this programme of refonn are outlined and critiqued. Specifically within the European Convention context, special attention will be paid to the derogation provisions contained in Article 15 of the Convention. This will operate as a prism through which to explore the conceptual and policy difficulties associated with securing state <b>compliance</b> with <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> of such treaty provisions. Arguing that the securing of state <b>compliance.</b> with <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> of their treaty obligations is at its most important during situations of emergency (when the potential for state abuse of fundamental rights and freedoms is heightened), this thesis advocates a series of specific, well-targeted refonns. If implemented, these refonns could help to ensure that the European Convention's <b>enforcement</b> <b>and</b> derogation frameworks are capable ofproviding continued high level rights protection {{even in the face of}} the challenges posed to rights protection in this post September 11 th (2001) era.

We introduce an event ontology part of a policy and rules ontology for <b>compliance</b> modeling <b>and</b> <b>enforcement.</b> The policy <b>and</b> rules ontology is able to take decisions depending {{on the state of}} an enterprise model. In our work, events are used to support modeling complex decision-making patterns and propagation.
