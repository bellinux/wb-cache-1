40|$|Introduction: {{treatment}} of locoregional advanced hypopharyngeal <b>cancers</b> <b>of</b> grades III and IV would be surgery and/or radiotherapy. An {{increasing number of}} authors has emphasized favorable effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy with potentiation. The aim: the authors presented therapeutical results of three-year survived patients with squamocellular <b>cancers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypopharynx</b> (SCC Hy), grades III and IV, in relation to specific modalities of therapeutical approach. Methods: a series of 207 patients with grades III and IV of SCC Hy, treated in the period 1982 to 2002, was analyzed. Group I consisted of 131 patients who had surgery and postoperative radiotherapy (SUR-RT). Group II included 16 patients who underwent induction chemotherapy, surgery and postoperative radiotherapy (IC-SURRT). Group III consisted of 60 patients, who had primary radiotherapy (RT). Group IV involved 29 patients who were treated, in the period 2003 - 2006, by neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy with potentiation (CHT-RT). Results: three-year survival in Group I was 67. 94 %, Group II - 50 %, Group III - 30 %, and in Group IV was 51. 72 %. Five-year survival was analyzed only in group IIII.

40|$|Various surgery {{techniques}} {{performed on}} 26 advanced cancer patients using forehead, deltopectoral(D-P) and musculocutaneous(M-C) flaps were reviwed. The D-P flap presents few cosmetic {{problems in the}} head and neck region and can be used in elder patients because of little operative invasion. The M-C flap allows for reconstruction of defects in a one-stage operation which may shorten hospitalization and permit an ealier return to social life. The forehead flap is the most durable and reliable flap among them for reconstructive surgery, though it offers some cosmetic problems. In reconstruction of the esophagus after a pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy for <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypopharynx</b> and the cervical esophagus, it seems more advantageous to use a hige flap in reconstruction than Bakamjian's original method since early detection of a local recurrence of the tumor is rendered easier with the former.

40|$|Cancer {{incidence}} among English south Asians (residents in England {{with ethnic}} origins in India, Pakistan or Bangladesh) is described and compared with non-south Asian and Indian subcontinent rates. The {{setting for the}} study was areas covered by Thames, Trent, West Midlands and Yorkshire cancer registries. The study identified 356 555 cases of incident cancer (ICD 9 : 140 – 208) registered between 1990 and 1992, including 3845 classified as English south Asian. The main outcome measures were age specific and directly standardized incidence rates for all cancer sites (ICD 9 : 140 – 208). English south Asian incidence rates for all sites combined were significantly lower than non-south Asian rates but higher than Indian subcontinent rates. English south Asian rates were substantially higher than Indian subcontinent rates {{for a number of}} common sites including lung cancer in males, breast cancer in females and lymphoma in both sexes. English south Asian rates for childhood and early adult cancer (0 – 29 years) were similar or higher than non-south Asian rates.

Surgical intervention needs {{to take into consideration}} the resultant quality of life, in particular fundamental functional outcomes such as speech and swallowing. The aim {{of this study is to}} look at these long-term functional outcomes, following pharyngolaryngectomy and free jejunal reconstruction. A total of 19 patients, each undergoing a pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal graft was included. Each had a primary tracheoesophageal puncture for insertion of an indwelling voice prosthesis for speech. Functional outcomes of speech and swallow were assessed by a qualified speech pathologist. The impact on patients' quality of life was assessed under 4 domains: impairment, disability, handicap, and well being. The mean time period to follow-up was 4 years. Eighteen of the 19 patients were tolerating an oral diet, with one patient reliant on percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeds. Seventeen patients (89 %) were assessed as either having either no-or only a mild degree-of dysphagia, with no evidence of aspiration. Of the 19 patients, 15 were utilizing tracheosophageal speech for communication with 11 (73 %) having no-or only a mild degree-of dsyphonia. Patients assessed as having no evidence of dysphagia or dysphonia also reported reduced levels of handicap and distress compared with patients experiencing any degree of dysphagia (P = 0. 46) or dysphonia (P = 0. 01). While rates of pharyngolaryngectomy increase, most patients have a poor long-term prognosis, heightening the significance of postoperative outcomes.

DESIGN [...] Cancer registrations were obtained from the Yorkshire Regional Cancer Registry for the six year period 1979 - 1984. Registrations relating to persons of Asian background were extracted using forenames and surnames. Data were analysed by disease category and age and sex specific incidence rates were calculated. These were compared with expected incidence rates for the non-Asian population and with rates for the Indian subcontinent derived from the Bombay Cancer Registry. SETTING [...] Data collection was confined to the Bradford Metropolitan District, population 449, 897 (1981). SUBJECTS [...] The Asians studied originated from Pakistan (65 %), India (28 %), Bangladesh (4 %), and East Africa (3 %). The total Asian population of the Bradford Metropolitan District was approximately 45, 000. MAIN RESULTS [...] Over the study period there were 178 Asian cancer registrations. The overall standardised registration ratio was 53. 7 for males (100 cases, 95 % confidence interval 43 - 64), and 43. 5 for females (78 cases, 95 % CI 34 - 53). The standardised registration ratios for <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypopharynx</b> in males and gall bladder in females were significantly raised. There was a particularly low incidence of cancer of the stomach, large bowel, lung, skin, and bladder in males, and of skin, breast, cervix (in situ), and ovary in females. The analyses suggested that lung and breast cancer incidence may be increasing towards the non-Asian level. In situ cancer of cervix in Asians shows no evidence of the high rates found in younger non-Asian age groups. CONCLUSIONS [...] Lower incidence of many cancers in Asians may be due to lower exposure to major risk factors. Demographic change resulting in increased exposure to these risk factors can be expected to result in an increase in cancer incidence in Asians...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Background. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the feasibility and efficacy of hyperfractionated ac-celerated radiotherapy (HFRCB) combined with simultaneous chemotherapy with weekly cisplatin (CDDP) in locally advanced inoperable head and neck cancer. Methods. From August 1999 to December 2002, 37 patients (median age, 59 years) with Union Internationale Contre le Can-cer stage III (n = 2) and stage IV (n = 35) squamous cell <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oropharynx and <b>hypopharynx</b> were treated in a prospec-tive phase I/II trial. Concomitant boost radiotherapy (1. 8 Gy, days 1 – 38 and 1. 5 Gy boost, days 22 – 38, twice daily with at least a 6 -hour interval; total dose 69. 9 Gy) and simultaneous cisplatin, 40 mg/m 2 weekly, were given. Results. The median treatment duration was 42 days (range, 38 – 46 days). Toxicity was manageable, with neutropenia grade III/IV and thrombocytopenia grade IV in seven and one patients, and mucositis grade III/IV in 27 and five patients, respectively. Chemotherapy was restricted to four weekly applications in 29 patients mainly because of mucosal toxicity with a median dose intensity of 160 mg/m 2 (0 – 200) of cisplatin in 5. 5 weeks. With a median follow-up of 28 months for living patients, the 2 -year overall survival rate was 67 %. The median overall and relapse-free survival times were 36 and 31 months, respectively. Conclusion. HFRCB in combination with weekly cisplatin achieves a high rate of locoregional control and survival. Four weekly cycles of 40 mg/m 2 cisplatin seem to be the dose limit fo...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with {{advanced}} <b>cancers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larynx and <b>hypopharynx</b> {{have been treated}} with total laryngectomy at <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Head and Neck Surgery, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney in the past. Increasingly, these patients are being managed with organ-sparing protocols using chemo-therapy and radiotherapy. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{present study was to}} review complication, recurrence and survival rates following total laryngectomy. METHODS: Patients who had total laryngectomy for squamous carcinomas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larynx or <b>hypopharynx</b> between 1987 and 1998 and whose clinicopathological data had been prospectively accessioned onto <b>the</b> computerized database <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Head and Neck Surgery, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, were reviewed. Patients whose laryngectomy was a salvage procedure for failed previous treatment were included. RESULTS: A total of 147 patients met the inclusion criteria for the study, including 128 men and 19 women with a median age of 63 years. Primary cancers involved the larynx in 90 patients and hypopharynx in 57. There were 30 patients who had recurrent (n = 24) or persistent disease (n = 6) after previous treatment with radiotherapy (26 larynx cases and four hypopharynx cases). Pharyngo-cutaneous fistulas occurred in 26 cases (17. 7 %) and, using multivariate analysis, the incidence did not correlate with T stage, previous treatment or concomitant neck dissection. Local control rates were 86 % for the larynx and 77 % for the hypo-pharynx groups and neck control was 84 % and 75 %, respectively. Five-year survival for the larynx cancer group was 67 % and this was significantly influenced by T stage and clinical and pathological N stage. Survival in <b>the</b> <b>hypopharynx</b> group was 37 % at 5 years and this did not significantly correlate with T or N stage. There was a non-significant trend to improved survival among previously treated patients whose laryngectomy was a salvage procedure. CONCLUSION: Patients with <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larynx had a significantly better survival following total laryngectomy than patients with hypopharyngeal cancer. Those whose laryngectomy was carried out as a salvage procedure following failed previous treatment did not have a worse outcome than previously untreated patients...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Primary {{hypopharynx}} {{involvement of}} small cell carcinoma {{is very rare}} and very few cases {{have been reported in}} the literature. Here, we report a case of primary small cell carcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypopharynx</b> in a male patient. Case Report. A 50 -year-old man presented with a 6 -month history of sore throat and swellings in <b>the</b> right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck. Direct laryngoscopy and biopsy revealed small cell carcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypopharynx</b> located in <b>the</b> right pyriform sinus. Discussion. Small cell carcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypopharynx</b> has no clear treatment modality due to <b>the</b> rarity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} (SCC) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypopharynx</b> represents a distinct clinical entity among other <b>cancers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{head and neck}} region. Despite recent advances in chemoradiotherapy, surgery remains the preferred therapeutic option for locally advanced disease and salvage for failure after chemo-radiotherapy. In this article, several aspects of surgical and non-surgical approaches in <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> hypopharyngeal <b>cancer</b> are discussed. METHODS: A search in pubmed was made for publications with regard to <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> hypopharyngeal carcinoma. RESULTS: In early-staged hypopharyngeal cancer, the overall and disease-specific survival rates after organ-preserving radiotherapy is comparable to that after surgery. However, for advanced staged disease, the results initial surgery with post-operative adjuvant radiotherapy was superior to chemoradiotherapy alone. <b>The</b> incidence <b>of</b> occult nodal metastasis {{is found to be}} more than 20 %. Selective neck dissection removing cervical lymph node level II-IV is <b>the</b> procedure <b>of</b> choice for patients with clinically N 0 neck. Contralateral nodal clearance may also be considered in tumors involving <b>the</b> medial wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyriform recess, post-crioid region or the posterior wall, and those with ipsilateral palpable nodal metastasis and clinical stage IV disease. Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) has the potential value as the minimally invasive procedure for <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> carcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypopharynx.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> treatment strategy for carcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypopharynx</b> has been evolving with time. Organ preserving chemoradiotherapy has been <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> choice for early stage disease, with surgical resection and reconstruction reserved for advanced and recurrent tumors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Two {{patients}} with primary small cell carcinoma (SmCC) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypopharynx,</b> an extremely rare site for <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> SmCC, are reported and nine additional well-documented cases are reviewed. Methods. Case {{report and review}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature concerning primary SmCC <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypopharynx.</b> Results. On <b>the</b> final analysis, we reviewed eleven cases of primary SmCC <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypopharynx.</b> <b>The</b> tumors contained mixed elements of SmCC and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in six (55 %) of eleven patients. Out of eleven patients, two patients had distant metastasis at the initial presentation. Even though nine patients presented with locoregional disease, development of distant metastasis after treatment was seen in five patients (56 %), whereas there was no report of treatment failure on the primary site. To achieve more than two-year survival, patients should have received more than 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Conclusion. We report two cases of primary SmCC <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypopharynx</b> with a review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature. In more than half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases, combined carcinomas with SCC are seen.
