Forest management, natural disturbances, and the fate of carbon in wood products strongly influence carbon sequestration and emissions in the forest sector.

40|$|Food {{consumption}} {{may account}} for upwards of 15 % of U. S. per capita greenhouse gas emissions. Online <b>carbon</b> <b>calculators</b> can help consumers prioritize among dietary behaviors to minimize personal "carbon footprints," leveraging against emissions-intensive industry practices. We reviewed the fitness of selected <b>carbon</b> <b>calculators</b> for measuring and communicating indirect GHG emissions from food consumption. Calculators were evaluated based on the scope of user behaviors accounted for, data sources, transparency of methods, consistency with prior data and effectiveness of communication. We found food consumption was under-represented (25 %) among general environmental impact calculators (nÂ =Â  83). We identified eight <b>carbon</b> <b>calculators</b> that accounted for food consumption and included U. S. users among the target audience. Among these, meat and dairy consumption was appropriately highlighted as the primary diet-related contributor to emissions. Opportunities exist to improve upon these tools, including: expanding the scope of behaviors included under calculations; improving communication, in part by emphasizing the ecological and public health co-benefits of less emissions-intensive diets; and adopting more robust, transparent methodologies, particularly where calculators produce questionable emissions estimates. Further, all calculators could benefit from more comprehensive data on the U. S. food system. These advancements may better equip these tools for effectively guiding audiences toward ecologically responsible dietary choices.

40|$|The direct {{emissions}} {{of greenhouse gases}} (GHG) from agriculture accounted for around 10 % of total European Union (EU) emissions in 2010. It has been estimated that in the United Kingdom the agri-food sector as whole contributes around 19 % of GHG emissions when life cycle emissions are taken into account. To reduce the farming-related GHG emissions appropriate policy instruments and supporting tools that promote low carbon farming practices must be developed. This paper describes an on-going project that aims at assessing the policy options to promote low carbon farming practices in the EU. The project includes: i) a review of existing farm-level life-cycle based carbon calculators and climate-related certification and labelling schemes, ii) the development of a user friendly open-source <b>carbon</b> <b>calculator</b> suitable for assessing the life cycle GHG emissions from different types of farming systems across the whole EU, and iii) the design/assessment of policy options for promoting low carbon farming practices. The <b>carbon</b> <b>calculator</b> is expected to quantify direct and indirect GHG emissions according to the general-level and sector-specific international standards and guidelines on Life Cycle Assessment and carbon footprint. In addition to the GHG emission quantification, the tool is also expected to propose mitigation options and sequestration actions suitable for single farms. Specific farming practices will be recommended on the basis of emission reduction potential, potential leakage effects, inherent costs of implementation, and impact on other environmental issues. The practicality and acceptability of the <b>carbon</b> <b>calculator</b> will be tested on around a hundred farms across the EU. Finally, a range of options for making widespread use of the <b>carbon</b> <b>calculator</b> will be outlined, including e. g. public or private certification schemes, incentive payments to farmers, and legal obligations for farmers to reduce GHG emissions.
