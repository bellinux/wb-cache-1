40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} stress distribution of side plates on the logging truck’s <b>cable</b> <b>reel,</b> {{and find the}} cause of side plates cracking, an elastic-plastic finite element model of three-dimension is set up. Based {{on a series of}} computations, the distributions of displacement and equivalent stress under the working conditions are analyzed, as well as the influence of the number of side plate floors on stress distribution. The results indicate the maximum equivalent stress is on the outside connection between side plate and <b>cable</b> <b>reel,</b> and the floors take the most part loads from steel cables. When the number of floors is greater than 11, increasing the floor number will not decrease the maximum equivalent stress obviously. The conclusion provides useful method and foundation for resolving floor cracking on logging trucks...|$|R

40|$|The main {{consideration}} of any reeling {{system is the}} effect it has on cable tensions and hence cable life. This paper explains the relationship of <b>reel</b> torque to <b>cable</b> tensions and the reasons why this relationship is so important. Such system is characterized by variable parameters, primarily a variable moment of inertia and a variable diameter of the coiled cable. For these reasons, {{in order to ensure}} proper dimensioning of the drive, it is necessary to know the motor torques that need to be developed {{as a function of the}} coiled cable. The motor should be able to develop the required torques in a very wide speed range. It is shown that for properly sizing the motor it is necessary take into account the dynamics of the <b>cable</b> <b>reel</b> drive. In this paper monospiral motorized <b>cable</b> <b>reel</b> for winding power cable in crane applications with frequency converter fed induction motor is analyzed. Also, the equipment selection procedure for the real crane with concrete data is shown. Experimental results are recorded during the crane commissioning in real condition...|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{electric}} locomotives were used only {{where it was}} economical to string overhead line for power. This limited their usage for gathering loads at the mine face, where trackage was temporary and frequently relocated. This motivated the development of battery locomotives, but {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century the first successful electric gathering locomotives used <b>cable</b> <b>reels.</b> To run on tracks away from overhead lines, the power cable was clipped to the overhead line and then automatically unreeled as the locomotive advanced and reeled up as the locomotive returned.|$|E

40|$|A stand alone, mobile {{photovoltaic}} {{power system}} along with a cable deployment system was designed and constructed {{to take part in}} the Desert Research And Technology Studies (RATS) lunar surface human interaction evaluation program at Cinder Lake, Arizona. The power system consisted of a photovoltaic array/battery system. It is capable of providing 1 kW of electrical power. The system outputs were 48 V DC, 110 V AC, and 220 V AC. A <b>cable</b> <b>reel</b> with 200 m of power cable was used to provide power from the trailer to a remote location. The <b>cable</b> <b>reel</b> was installed on a small trailer.
