40|$|The {{prognostic}} {{importance of}} ploidy and proliferative index (%S + G 2) assessed by flow cytometry, mitotic and centroblast counts, and histological growth pattern were evaluated in biopsy specimens taken before treatment from 60 cases of <b>centroblastic-centrocytic</b> non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cases {{with a high}} proliferative index (greater {{than or equal to}} 18 %) or DNA aneuploidy showed significantly poorer survival than those with a low proliferative index (less than 18 %). A high mitotic count was also associated with a poor prognosis. On multiple regression analysis the flow cytometric assessments and mitotic counts were significant predictors of survival. Assessments of proliferative activity clearly have prognostic potential in <b>centroblastic-centrocytic</b> lymphoma and may permit more accurate characterisation of individual tumours...|$|E
40|$|The {{sizes of}} {{follicle}} centre cells in 15 specimens of follicular (<b>centroblastic-centrocytic)</b> non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 15 specimens of reactive follicular hyperplasia have been measured. The findings differ from previous studies, where nuclei of cells from follicle centres and interfollicular areas were measured and {{revealed no significant}} difference between follicular lymphoma and reactive follicular hyperplasia. In the current study, by measuring only follicle centre cell nuclei, it has been found that, in reactive follicular hyperplasia, the mean nuclear maximum diameter (Dmax) and area are significantly greater than in <b>centroblastic-centrocytic</b> follicular lymphoma. In addition, the standard deviation of these data is greater for reactive follicular hyperplasia than follicular lymphoma, implying greater "scatter" or heterogeneity of the nuclear sizes in the follicle centre cells of the former than the latter. Thus, the size of these cells appears to be of value as an histological discriminator between these benign and malignant conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{group of}} 424 lymphomas {{diagnosed}} as <b>centroblastic-centrocytic</b> lymphomas at the Lymph Node Registry in Kiel was subdivided into small (S), mixed (M) and large (L) cell groups, {{according to the}} "working formulation" proposed in a National Cancer Institute sponsored study. Histological epidemiological and clinical parameters were studied. It was found that in group S a follicular growth pattern was most frequent and in group L a follicular and diffuse growth, while group M took an intermediate position. No statistically {{significant differences were found}} in respect to epidemiological factors or overall survival. However, in the first 6 years after the diagnosis the survival in group S was better than in group M, but thereafter a reversal occurred. Group L appeared to have the worst survival throughout. Growth pattern and sclerosis were found to be of limited influence on survival within the cytological groups...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} 92 {{malignant}} lymphomas of the gastrointestinal tract and mesentery {{obtained from a}} population-based registry was studied to assess whether the newly defined concept of mucosa-associated lymphoma has clinical relevance. The cases were grouped according to localization; gastric, intestinal, and mesenteric lymphoma. All cases were reviewed histologically, graded according to the Working Formulation, and reclassified according to the Kiel classification, which was modified to include the categories low- and high-grade mucosa-associated lymphoma. Clinical data, as well as staging and follow-up data, were related to both the original diagnosis and the diagnosis after reclassification. The {{results showed that the}} distribution of the types of lymphoma is related to site: centroblastic lymphoma was predominant in the stomach, lymphoblastic in the bowel, and follicular <b>centroblastic-centrocytic</b> in the mesentery. Gastrointestinal lymphoma was disseminated in approximately 50 % of the patients at presentation. Survival analysis revealed that classification according to the original Kiel classification and grading according to the Working Formulation provided important prognostic information, whereas introduction of mucosa-associated lymphoma as an entity did not. It was concluded that modification of current classifications to include a separate category for mucosa-associated lymphoma is not useful...|$|E
40|$|Two-hundred and twenty-one {{bone marrow}} biopsies with lymphoid infiltrates were studied histologically and immunohistochemically, {{to assess the}} {{incidence}} and the pattern of follicular dendritic cells. Three monoclonal antibodies selective for follicular dendritic cells were used: CD 21, CD 35 and DR 53, all reactive on paraffin-embedded material. Follicular dendritic cells were present in two of 38 benign lymphoid aggregates, 92 of 134 low grade B-cell lymphomas (45 of 62 lymphocytic, 16 of 27 lymphoplasmacytoid, 0 of six hairy cell leukaemias, five of six centrocytic, 19 of 21 <b>centroblastic-centrocytic,</b> seven of 12 low grade NOS), one of 23 high grade B-cell lymphomas, 0 of 10 T-cell lymphomas, 0 of three Hodgkin's disease and four of 13 suspicious infiltrates. Follicular dendritic cells were found in lymphomatous involvement with nodular, patchy and massive growth pattern, but not in interstitial ones. They formed follicle-like networks, whose number and size were directly correlated to the tumour mass. The origin and frequency distribution of follicular dendritic cells in bone marrow biopsy lymphomas is discussed and the diagnostic relevance of follicular dendritic cell immunostaining in routine bone marrow biopsy lymphoid infiltrates is assesse...|$|E
40|$|BCL- 6 {{is a novel}} {{proto-oncogene}} that {{codes for}} a zinc-finger protein sharing homologies with many transcription factors. It has recently been shown that BCL- 6 is involved in chromosome band 3 q 27 aberrations in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) and BCL- 6 rearrangements have been detected in 34 - 45 per cent of diffuse large cell lymphomas with B immunophenotype. We have studied the BCL- 6 gene configuration by Southern blot analysis in 60 cases of B-cell NHL and in 17 cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD). BCL- 6 was rearranged in 15 / 46 (32. 6 per cent) diffuse B-large cell lymphomas, mainly with centroblastic morphology, and in 2 / 11 (18. 2 per cent) follicular (<b>centroblastic-centrocytic)</b> lymphomas. Conversely, all cases of HD, including four cases of lymphocyte predominant, nodular type (nodular paragranuloma), had a germline configuration. These findings confirm that BCL- 6 is rearranged in {{a significant percentage of}} diffuse B-large cell lymphomas, suggesting that this proto-oncogene might have a pathogenetic role in this subset of NHLs, but our preliminary analysis suggests that BCL- 6 lesions are not involved in the pathogenesis of HD. However, further investigations using more sensitive techniques are required to confirm these finding...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of the t(14; 18) chromosome translocations that occur in non-Hodgkin <b>centroblastic-centrocytic</b> follicular lymphoma can be detected by various methods. During the translocation process the bcl- 2 gene located on chromosome 18 (18 q 21) is translocated to the JH region of the immunoglobulin gene of chromosome 14 (14 q 32). The most frequent type of bcl- 2 translocations is the mbr type, whereas the immunoglobulin gene breaks mainly at the JH 1 - 6 exons. About one of the 10 (5) cells bearing the translocation can already be detected by using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Eight patients suffering from follicular lymphoma were included in this study, which considered {{the usefulness of the}} PCR method. The results are in good agreement with those obtained by conventional diagnostic methods. Translocation can be detected, however, in patients with non-malignant diseases such as SjÃ¶gren's syndrome (about 5 % of the patients) and in a patient with Whipple disease. In addition, translocation was detected in lymphocytes of peripheral blood of a healthy donor. Since lymphomas are detected in patients with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome with a relative high frequency, an early diagnosis of the translocation could improve the treatment of the disease. Nevertheless, a diagnosis of lymphoma is valid only in cases of bone marrow translocation-positivity...|$|E
40|$|Mouse erythrocyte-rosette-forming cells (MRFC) were {{determined}} in 76 cases of {{chronic lymphocytic leukaemia}} (CLL), 19 cases of <b>centroblastic-centrocytic</b> follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), five cases of hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) and in 62 control patients. The mean percentage of MRFC in B-CLL was 54. 8 % +/- 24. 4 %, in nodular centro-follicular NHL 2. 3 % +/- 3 %, in hairy cell leukaemia 14. 6 % +/- 14. 7 % and among the controls 3. 2 % +/- 1. 9 %. Thus, MRFC {{appear to be an}} excellent marker of B-CLL and sometimes the only B cell marker as in 11 cases of SIg negative CLL. There is no correlation between the percentage of MRFC and clinical staging according to Rai classification whereas patients with stage 2 in Binet's classification (isolated splenomegaly) have a significantly lower MRFC percentage (23. 4 % +/- 27. 7 %; P less than 0. 05). There is no correlation with prognosis, nor with serum Ig levels. We found no correlation with surface phenotype IgM, IgM-IgD or IgG. Thus, this study does not confirm the hypothesis that MRFC might characterize and immature stage in the B lymphocyte differentiation. However, these results are consistent with another hypothesis which states that lymphocytes in CLL possibly originate from a clonal expansion of a normal B lymphocyte subset, characterized by a low concentration of SIg and a receptor for mouse erythrocytes...|$|E
40|$|The bcl- 2 proto-oncogene, rearranged and {{deregulated}} in B-cell lymphomas {{bearing the}} t(14; 18) translocation, encodes an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that blocks apoptotic cell death. We {{have developed a}} sensitive immunofluorescence assay for the single- and multicolor flow cytometric analysis of bcl- 2 protein {{in relation to other}} markers and cell cycle, based on a fixation-permeation step of cells with paraformaldehyde and Triton X 100 and the use of a bcl- 2 specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb). As an application of this method, we have examined the expression of bcl- 2 in normal and neoplastic lymphoid cells. We have found that greater than 80 % of normal T-and B-cells are bcl- 2 positive; following in vitro mitogen activation, the bcl- 2 reactivity decreased slightly in the former but markedly in latter cells. In both cases the bcl- 2 expression was not restricted to a specific phase of the cell cycle, as evidenced by two-color analysis. On lymphoblastoid cell lines, the bcl- 2 staining intensity was variable and not necessarily correlated to molecular rearrangements of the bcl- 2 gene. Among fresh B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHL), most sporadic Burkitt's cases were bcl- 2 negative. Of four <b>centroblastic-centrocytic</b> cases with rearrangements of the bcl- 2 gene, only two presented elevated amounts of bcl- 2 protein, indicating that the levels of bcl- 2 are not diagnostic of the translocation.

40|$|At histopathological {{diagnosis}} of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) {{the mean number}} of mitoses in 10 high power fields (X 40) was determined in thin sections (2 micron) and designated 'mitotic index' (MI). In 38 patients the thymidine labelling index (LI) of the lymphoma cells was also determined. There was a close correlation between MIs and LIs (r = 0. 81, P less than 0. 001) indicating that MI reflects the proliferative activity in NHL. Among 101 patients with NHL classified according to the Kiel nomenclature MIs were generally lower in lymphomas of low grade malignant type than in the high grade malignant lymphomas. The variation of MIs within morphological subgroups was especially pronounced in high grade lymphomas. Only 18 of 49 patients (37 %) with MI {{greater than or equal to}} 2 have survived for 2 years in contrast to 37 of 52 patients (77 %) with MI less than 2 (P = 0. 001). For patients with histologically low grade lymphomas and MI greater than or equal to 2. 0 the median survival was 23 months and for those with MI less than 2. 0 58 months (P = 0. 09). Patients with high grade lymphomas and MI greater than or equal to 2. 0 had a median survival of 15 months compared to 57 months for those with MI less than 2. 0 (P = 0. 04). In a multivariate analysis of 50 patients with <b>centroblastic-centrocytic</b> (CB-CC) or centroblastic (CB) lymphomas the importance of different prognostic factors was analysed. Among the variables age, MI, growth pattern (follicular vs. diffuse), cell type (CB-CC vs. CB), clinical stage (I vs. II-IV), initial chemotherapy (active vs. less active) only age and MI gave significant prognostic information. It is concluded that the assessment of mitoses in NHL gives prognostic information in addition to histopathologic classification. The method is simple and the proliferative activity and histopathological diagnosis can be ascertained routinely on the same occasion...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is both hepatotropic and {{lymphotropic}} and a dear-cut {{association has}} been proposed between HCV infection and mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC), a benign lymphoproliferative disorder, which sometimes evolves into a frank malignant B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL). Moreover, the presence of antibodies to HCV, {{as well as of}} HCV-specific genomes has been reported in the sera of over 37 % patients with B-NHL, not associated with MC. Thus, we decided to perform both a serologic and a molecular study to give insights into a possible relationship between HCV infection and neoplastic lymphoproliferations. We used ELISA and RIBA tests to show that anti-HCV antibodies were present in the serum of 29 out of 69 unselected B-NHL patients (42 %), while seropositivity in a healthy population was about 1 %. The prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies was low in definite subsets of B lymphoid disorders, including multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance. Then, using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we detected HCV sequences directly in the pathologic lymph node biopsies in 13 out of 34 B-NHL cases, and in particular in six out of eight low-grade lymphomas of MALT type and in five out of eight <b>centroblastic-centrocytic</b> follicular lymphomas. In contrast, the peripheral blood samples from 10 B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients resulted negative for the presence of HCV genomes. Similarly, viral sequences were absent in 10 T cell NHL, while only one out of the 14 Hodgkin's disease cases tested resulted positive. Finally, we used a PCR-based assay to characterize the genotypes (I-IV) present in the positive lymphomatous tissues. The presence of both serologic and molecular markers of HCV infection in a high percentage of certain types of B-NHL, not associated with cryoglobulinemia, and its absence from other lymphoproliferative diseases extends the spectrum of HCV-associated lymphoproliferations arguing in favor of some role of this viral infection in the pathogenesis of the malignant proliferation of definite B lymphoid populations...|$|E
