50|$|In {{the early}} days of {{coordinate}} measurement, mechanical probes were fitted into a special holder {{on the end of the}} quill. A very <b>common</b> <b>probe</b> was made by soldering a hard ball to the end of a shaft. This was ideal for measuring a whole range of flat, cylindrical or spherical surfaces. Other probes were ground to specific shapes, for example a quadrant, to enable measurement of special features. These probes were physically held against the workpiece with the position in space being read from a 3-Axis digital readout (DRO) or, in more advanced systems, being logged into a computer by means of a footswitch or similar device. Measurements taken by this contact method were often unreliable as machines were moved by hand and each machine operator applied different amounts of pressure on the probe or adopted differing techniques for the measurement.|$|E

When mutated to cysteine, residues in this region render minK susceptible to covalent blockade by methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonate and alter reversible inhibition by tetraethylammonium.

Since inhibition by external tetraethylammonium is sensitive to voltage and to the internal concentration of permeant ions, we argue that tetraethylammonium blocks by occluding the external end of a water-filled transmembrane pore.

Because of the lack of proper materials, nickel and ceramic cements were used. Soon, though, small high-temperature probes with guards and thermocouples can be made with tantalum and alumina tubes.

30|$|In this paper, {{photolithography}} is used {{to initiate}} contact to silver nanowire junctions using gold electrodes. Using a <b>common</b> <b>probe</b> station, current is driven through the electrodes and, hence, the nanowires {{for the purpose of}} welding the two nanowires together. A welding procedure is prepared and tested for reliable welding of silver nanowires, which destroys intermediate layers and welds the two nanowires. This procedure requires two steps, which is contrary to Joule heating recipes presented previously. Due to a lack of significant intermediate layers, other researchers were able to weld nano-objects together using constant current [13, 14] or constant voltage [15]. This method of welding is insufficient with this type of nanowire due to large initial resistances and breakdown behavior. This process is also applicable to other corrosion-prone nanowires such as copper and aluminum nanowires, as well as for other metal nanowires where fabrication processes introduce intermediate layers at the contacts.|$|E

We analyze the transport coefficients in detail and identify the type of Lifshitz transitions as neck or void type to gain information on the Fermi surface of YbNi 4 P 2. The large number of Lifshitz transitions observed within this small energy window is unprecedented and results from the particular flat renormalized band structure with strong 4 f-electron character shaped by the Kondo lattice effect.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Due to {{the unique}} {{physicochemical}} properties of nanomaterials (NM) and their unknown reactivity, the possibility of NM altering the optical properties of fluorometric/ colorimetric probes {{that are used to}} measure their cyto- and genotoxicity may lead to inaccurate readings. This could have potential implications given that NM, such as ultrafine superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USPION), are increasingly finding their use in nanomedicine and the absorbance/ fluorescence based assays are used to assess their toxicity. This study looks at the potential of dextran-coated USPION (dUSPION) (maghemite and magnetite) to alter the background signal of <b>common</b> <b>probes</b> used for evaluating cytotoxicity (MTS, CyQUANT, Calcein, and EthD- 1) and oxidative stress (DCFH-DA and APF). In the present study, both forms of dUSPION caused an increase in MTS signal but a decrease in background signal from calcein and 3 '-(p-aminophenyl) fluorescein (APF) and no effect on CyQUANT and EthD- 1 fluorescence responses.

40|$|We propose an all-fiber-based dual-modal {{imaging system}} that {{combines}} noncontact photoacoustic tomography (PAT) and {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT). The PAT remotely measures photoacoustic (PA) signals with a 1550 -nm laser {{on the surface of}} a sample by utilizing a fiber interferometer as an ultrasound detector. The fiber-based OCT, employing a swept-source laser centered at 1310 nm, shares the sample arm of the PAT system. The fiber-optic probe for the combined system was homemade with a lensed single-mode fiber (SMF) and a large-core multimode fiber (MMF). The compact and robust <b>common</b> <b>probe</b> is capable of obtaining both the PA and the OCT signals at the same position without any physical contact. Additionally, the MMF of the probe delivers the short pulses of a Nd:YAG laser to efficiently excite the PA signals. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed dual-modal system with a phantom made of a fishing line and a black polyethylene terephthalate fiber in a tissue mimicking solution.

Direct comparison of the newly developed probes with previously used ones would be {{an important step in}} assessing possible applications.

Our results indicate that PSP 1 efficiently targeted apoptotic cells and generated apoptosis/ tumor-specific signals after cancer treatment in the animal model, whereas a similar dose of annexin V showed weak signals. The formation of a stable complex of PSP 1 with PS might be one reason for the efficient in vivo targeting.

40|$|The {{idea that}} a quantum magnet could act like a liquid crystal, {{breaking}} spin-rotation symmetry without breaking time-reversal symmetry, holds an abiding fascination. However, {{the very fact that}} spin nematic states do not break time-reversal symmetry renders them "invisible" to the most <b>common</b> <b>probes</b> of magnetism - they do not exhibit magnetic Bragg peaks, a static splitting of lines in NMR spectra, or oscillations in muSR. Nonetheless, as a consequence of breaking spin-rotation symmetry, spin-nematic states do possess a characteristic spectrum of dispersing excitations which could be observed in experiment. With this in mind, we develop a symmetry-based description of long-wavelength excitations in a spin-nematic state, based on an SU(3) generalisation of the quantum non-linear sigma model. We use this field theory to make explicit predictions for inelastic neutron scattering, and argue that the wave-like excitations it predicts could be used to identify the symmetries broken by the otherwise unseen spin-nematic order.
