In general, the product ion spectra were qualitatively similar for both modes of ionization, but electrospray ionization was strikingly more efficient in generation of abundant carboxylate anions that could be collisionally activated to yield product ion spectra. Collision-induced dissociation fragmentation mechanisms were described generally by α-hydroxy fragmentations directed by relative positions of double bonds and were consistent with stable isotope labeling studies. Rearrangement of the <b>conjugated</b> <b>triene</b> system in dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids may be described by formation of a cyclohexadiene structure.

This work was focused on the metabolism of fatty acids owning conjugated and/or trans double bonds, i. e.

We have shown that C 18 : 1 TFA isomers could be processed differently in intestinal cells and that c 9 t 11 CLA, either directly added to cells or converted from trans-vaccenic acid (TVA), undergoes the same metabolic processing as the ω- 3 or ω- 6 C 18 fatty acids.

Finally, we showed that the t 11 t 13 CLA isomer might also be a source of c 9 t 11 CLA. This work highlights that Caco- 2 cells cultivated in serum-free conditions are able to absorb, accumulate and metabolize TFA, CLA and CLnA, sometimes very efficiently, and underlines that c 9 t 11 CLA could be produced from different pathways and fatty acid precursors.

During the {{refrigeration}} of minced meat, {{there are}} two major oxidative processes responsible for changing the colour and smell of meat: myoglobin oxidation and the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. Researches have shown that polyphenols extracted from plants have the capacity to reduce lipids and proteins oxidation processes in meat. In this study we aimed to determine the antioxidant effect of polyphenols extracted from dog rose (Rosa canina) fruits on myoglobin and lipids in refrigerated minced beef. Oxidative processes of myoglobin and lipids have been evaluated by assessing myoglobin (Mb) and metmyoglobin (MMb) concentration, conjugated dienes (CD), <b>conjugated</b> <b>trienes</b> (CT) and compounds that react with thiobarbituric acid (TBARS). The results showed that the antioxidant activity of polyphenols extracted from dog rose fruits is dependent on their concentration. In concentrations of 50, 100 and 150 μg gallic acid equivalent/g minced meat, polyphenols had a gradual antioxidant effect, while the concentration of 200 μg gallic acid equivalent/g minced meat showed a slight prooxidant effect compared to 150 μg GAE/g minced meat concentration. Due to the antioxidant activity exerted on myoglobin and lipids, polyphenols extracted from dog rose fruits can be used to maintain colour and flavour of minced beef subject to refrigeration...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study {{was carried out}} to investigate the extent of changes in sunflower oil under auto-,and -photo-oxidation conditions. Freshly prepared refined, bleached and deodorized (RBD) samples of Sunflower oil (SFO) were subjected to auto- and photo-oxidation. The free-fatty acid (FFA) contents of the auto- and-photooxidized samples increased from 0. 056 to 0. 290 % and from 0. 056 to 0. 369 %,respectively. The relative increase in thevalues of RI (40 oC), Peroxide value, P-anisidine, <b>conjugated</b> dienes, <b>conjugated</b> <b>trienes</b> of the auto- and- photooxidized samples {{were found to be}} 1. 4635 - 1. 4671 and 1. 4635 - 1. 4672, 0. 85 - 7. 09 and 0. 85 - 17. 3 meq/kg, 1. 45 - 10. 03, 1. 45 - 17. 16, 0. 09 - 15. 5 and 0. 09 - 19. 3, 0. 15 - 13. 4 and 0. 15 - 15. 5,respectively. The iodine values were found to decrease from 139 - 127. 5 and 139 - 123. 3 for auto- and- photo- oxidized samples, respectively. From the Results of various investigated parameters, it was concluded that the oxidative deterioration level of the photo-oxidized SFO samples is more as compared to that of auto- oxidation. Based on this study, it is proposed that efforts should be made to minimize the hazard of photo-oxidation during the transportation and storage of such oils...|$|R
40|$|Mouse {{resident}} macrophages are potent {{sources of}} arachidonic acid (20 : 4) 1 metabolites generated via both the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways (1 - 5). The phospholipids of this cell are highly enriched with 20 : 4, and upon appropriate membrane stimulation, up to 50 % of endogenous 20 : 4 is released and metabolized to {{a mixture of}} prostaglandins, hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), and leukotriene C, a slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (2 - 3). Resident macrophages also {{have the capacity to}} quantitatively convert exogenously supplied 20 : 4 {{in the absence of a}} stimulus to a qualitatively different mixture of oxygenated products (4). The overall proportion of lipoxygenase products is enhanced compared to the metabolites generated from endogenous 20 : 4, but the formation of leukotriene C is diminished. Finally, the metabolites produced from either endogenous or exogenous sources of 20 : 4 are altered by the activation state of the macrophage (4 - 5). In this report, we show that resting macrophages have a considerable capacity to both incorporate mono-HETEs into cell phospholipid and metabolize these hydroxy acids. The major metabolite generated from 5 -HETE is a <b>conjugated</b> <b>triene,...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe indanedione {{series of}} vinyl ketone spin-labelling {{reagents}} {{has been extended}} in two ways: by increasing {{the length of the}} rigid spacer between the reactive centre and the nitroxide ring, or by introducing an electrophilic substituent (that could also hinder its rotation) at the bridge head position of the nitroxide ring. Three reagents of this new series have been used to spin label the Class II thiol groups of membranous Na,K-ATPase from Squalus acanthias. With a conjugated diene spacer, the majority of spin labels are strongly held but a minor population is relatively mobile at 37 °C. With a <b>conjugated</b> <b>triene</b> spacer, the nitroxide is still strongly held but a portion of the label is non-covalently bound. The 4 -bromo-pyrroline derivative (with short vinyl spacer) is tightly held at the attachment site, and the conventional electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra distinguish between the two enantiomeric structures which differ in their mobility at 37 °C. Saturation transfer EPR (ST-EPR) spectra of this label at 4 °C have been used to determine the dependence of the protein rotational mobility on ionic strength. Electrostatic repulsion contributes to the lateral interactions between Na,K-ATPase molecules...|$|E
40|$|The {{low energy}} {{collision}} induced dissociation (CID) of the carboxylate anions generated by electrospray ionization of leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) and 16 of its metabolites was studied in a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer. LTB 4 is a biologically active lipid mediator whose activity is terminated by metabolism {{into a wide}} variety of structural variants. The collisioninduced dissociation spectra of the carboxylate anions revealed structurally informative ions whose formation was determined by the position of hydroxyl substituents and double bonds present in the LTB 4 metabolite. Major ions resulted from charge remote α-hydroxy fragmentation or charge directed α-hydroxy fragmentation. The <b>conjugated</b> <b>triene</b> moiety present in some metabolites was proposed to undergo cyclization to a 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene structure prior to charge remote or charge driven a-hydroxy fragmentation. The mechanisms responsible for all major ions observed in the CID spectra were studied using stable isotope labeled analogs of the LTB 4 metabolites. In general, the collision-induced decomposition of carboxylate anions produced unique spectra for all LTB 4 derived metabolites. The observed decomposition product ions from the carboxylate anion could be useful in developing assays for these molecules in biological fluids...|$|E
40|$|Olive oil flavour {{represents}} {{the most important}} factor that influences customer’s perception for quality. In this study, an innovative aromatisation approach that enhanced quality and shelf life of olive oil is tested by means of in situ ultrasound-assisted extraction of Carum carvi L. seeds in olive oil. After the flavouring process, carvone and limonene, representing 99 % of caraway essential oil, were identified in virgin olive oil as revealed by headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatograph coupled to mass spectrometer (HS-SPME gas chromatograph (GC) /mass spectrometer (MS)) analyses. Furthermore, kinetic studies indicate that flavouring rate in ultrasound-assisted system is faster than conventional aromatisation producing very stable aromatised oil with no changes in quality. This fact is attributed to ultrasound contribution to mass transfer intensification of essential oil components from seeds to the bulk medium, confirmed by scanning electron micrograph (SEM) micrographs in which cell damage and exudation of its main content are illustrated. However, {{it is important to note}} that ultrasound-treated samples produce higher degrees of conjugated dienes and <b>conjugated</b> <b>trienes</b> compared to conventional maceration. Nevertheless, this increase is not alarming and remains within permitted values of the European Community and the International Olive Oil Council (IOOC). Ultrasoundflavouring system stands as a fast alternative aromatisation method, which allows on top shelf life enhancement and olive oil quality preservation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the research {{carried out in}} the development of novel homogeneous gold(I) -catalysed reactions. It is written in such a format as to describe chronologically the process in which the study and our understanding evolved. Chapter one provides an introduction to homogeneous gold catalysis and in particular the development and reactivity of gold(I) catalysts as powerful activators of unsaturated carbon-carbon species towards nucleophilic attack. Chapter two describes our initial work in this area and how we were able to show that gold(I) can catalyse the intramolecular rearrangements of cyclopropenes with ester functionalities. Chapter three presents the intermolecular addition of alcohol to 3, 3 -dialkyl and aryl cyclopropenes catalysed by gold(I). Chapter four describes how we were able to utilise our knowledge of gold(I) -catalysed reactions with cyclopropenes to completely switch the regiochemistry of gold(I) -catalysed hydroalkoxylation of allenes from producing primary alkyl allylic ethers to tertiary alkyl allylic ethers. We were also able to show that by trapping the vinyl gold intermediate we could further functionalise the tertiary allylic ether. Chapter five {{describes the}} results of the addition of furan to cyclopropenes catalysed by gold(I) to produce functionalised <b>conjugated</b> <b>trienes.</b> Chapter six presents initial work into the gold(I) catalysed addition of indoles to cyclopropenes. Also described in this chapter are the attempted reactions with a variety of alternative nucleophiles...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{determine}} the acylglycerols composition, quality characteristics, and protective role of dietary pumpkin seed oil (PSO) in rabbits. PSO was thermally oxidized and analyzed for quality characteristics and acylglycerols composition using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). Oxidized and un-oxidized oil samples were fed to the rabbits in different doses for 2 weeks. The changes in the serum biochemistry, hematology, and liver histology were studied. The levels of quality parameters such peroxide value (PV), anisidine value (AV), total phenolic contents (TPC), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), conjugated dienes (CD) and <b>conjugated</b> <b>trienes</b> (CT) significantly increased with thermal treatment. HPLC analyses revealed 10 individual triacylglycerols (TAGs), total di-acylglycerols (DAGs), mono-acylglycerols (MAGs), and total oxidized TAGs. Trilinolein (LLL), 1 -oleoyl- 2, 3 -dilinolinoyl glycerol (OLL), triolein (OOO) and 1, 2 -distearoyl- 3 -palmitoyl glycerol (SSP) were present in higher amounts and decreased with thermal treatment. Animal's studies showed that oxidized oils decreased the whole body weight, which was ameliorated by the co-administration of un-oxidized oils. The levels of serum biochemical parameters were improved by co-administration of pumpkin seed oils. There were no significant effects of both oxidized and un-oxidized PSO on the hematological and histological parameters of rabbits. In conclusion, nutritionally important triacylglycerols were present in PSO with protective role against the toxicity of its corresponding oxidized oils...|$|R
