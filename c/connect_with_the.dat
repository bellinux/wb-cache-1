5|$|Construction of a two-laned {{extension}} west to <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Ojibway Parkway (Highway18) {{began by}} the end of that year.|$|E
5|$|A tunnel at 76th Street {{that would}} {{connect to the}} Second Avenue Line that would run under the East River and <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{existing}} Long Island Rail Road main line.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} to the Northwestern Highway was again proposed in 1966 to <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> proposed I-275 extension. The I-275 project was then cancelled in 1977. The section of Northwestern Highway under state control between the West Bloomfield Township–Farmington Hills border into Southfield was numbered M-4 in 1979.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, {{three major}} {{commuter}} groups in New Jersey made expansion proposals. One {{of them would}} have involved an extension of the IRT Flushing Line under the Hudson River with a three-track tunnel and then <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad.|$|E
5|$|In the process, Highway62 was {{truncated}} {{at the new}} bypass; the removed {{section was}} redesignated Highway148, giving it the same number as the route in Quebec that it served to <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Trans-Canada Highway.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September 1868 {{the small}} Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway (A) was opened. It ran south from the London and North Western Railway's Oxford to Bletchley line at Verney Junction, via Quainton Road railway station, to <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Great Western Railway at Aylesbury.|$|E

5|$|Also in Brooklyn, the BMT Canarsie Line {{would gain}} an eastern branch to Spring Creek, serving Starrett City (now Spring Creek Towers). The {{mainline}} {{would also be}} lengthened from its southern terminus at Rockaway Parkway to a new terminus in Midwood and Flatlands near the existing Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College IRT station. The reroute would not use the existing segment between New Lots Avenue and Rockaway Parkway. Later plans suggested extending the line as far west as McDonald Avenue near the Avenue I station of the IND Culver Line or possibly to New Utrecht Avenue to the New Utrecht Avenue/62nd Street station, creating crosstown service through central Brooklyn. It was also proposed to relocate the Canarsie Line west of its current right-of-way south of Broadway Junction, along the parallel LIRR Bay Ridge Branch (currently a freight-only branch) or in the median of the proposed Queens Interboro Expressway and Cross Brooklyn Expressway, {{which would have been}} built along both the LIRR branch and Linden Boulevard. The re-alignment would have facilitated both extensions. The current Bushwick Avenue, Broadway Junction and Atlantic Avenue stations would have been consolidated into one station on the Bay Ridge Line, new Sutter Avenue and Livonia Avenue stations would have been built, and the East 105th Street station would be replaced with a station at Rockaway Avenue on the Bay Ridge Line. Additional stations would have been built at Remsen Avenue, Ralph Avenue, Utica Avenue to <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Utica Avenue Line, Nostrand Avenue to <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Nostrand Avenue Line, Avenue H to <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Brighton Line, and McDonald Avenue to connect to the Culver Line before terminating at New Utrecht Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Although {{described}} as a satellite terminal, the terminal building is connected by an above-ground corridor to Terminal 2. Departures {{take place on the}} lower deck (similar to the A380 boarding lounges currently in use at Gates 9 and 11), with arrivals streamed on to the first floor to <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> current first floor arrivals deck. All gates including 18 and 20 are now handling passengers.|$|E
5|$|Even {{following}} the conversion to cylindrical smokeboxes, {{it was still}} possible to distinguish some non-streamliners from ex-streamliners. On the former (Nos. 46230-46234 and 46249-46252, but not 46253-46257) the running plates veered downwards {{at right angles to}} <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> buffer beam {{in the style of the}} Princess Royal Class. The ex-streamliners did not have any such connection, except No.46242 City of Glasgow which was rebuilt in 1952 following a serious collision.|$|E

5|$|Llullaillaco {{appears to}} have been the most {{important}} Inca sacred mountain in the region. Archeological sites are also found in the valleys that drain Llullaillaco towards the Salar de Punta Negra, including the Quebrada Llullaillaco and the Quebrada de las Zorritas. The paths <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> major north-south axis that runs between San Pedro de Atacama and Copiapo. This axis is associated with the extensive Inca road system.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnant of}} the IRT Ninth Avenue Line at 155th Street would <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> IRT Lenox Avenue Line, giving riders of the Jerome Avenue Line service to Manhattan's West Side. This project was never {{undertaken}} {{because of the high}} cost of modifying the third rail in the Sedgwick Avenue and Anderson–Jerome Avenues tunnel section to accommodate new subway cars.|$|E
5|$|A forward {{command post}} of the HV General Staff was moved from Ogulin to Slunj, and it assumed direct {{command of the}} 1st Guards Brigade, the 14th Home Guard Regiment and the 99th Brigade. The 14th Home Guard Regiment secured the Slunj area and {{deployed}} to the left bank of Korana to <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> advancing Karlovac special police. Elements of the regiment and the 99th Brigade secured the national border in the area. The 1st Guards Brigade advanced towards Kordun, as the Karlovac Corps reoriented its main axis of attack. The 110th Home Guard Regiment and elements of the 104th Brigade reached a largely deserted Vojnić in early afternoon, followed by the 1st Guards Brigade, the 143rd Home Guard Brigade and the 137th Home Guard Regiment. Other HV units joined them by evening.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the closure}} of the tramway allowed {{planning}} to go ahead for a railway, the planning for the replacement railway line suffered various delays in the 1930s due to funding issues: the line's construction competed with a proposal to electrify the Illawarra Line to Waterfall, and there were disputes over {{the point at which the}} line would connect to the main line. Two early proposals to join the line at Como and north of Sutherland Station were rejected. Despite the delays, Parliament finally gave approval to the line on 2 March 1936, and a route with five new stations was surveyed that would <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> main line at the southern side of Sutherland station. The new line was opened on 16 December 1939.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the most}} {{powerful}} individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> concerns of the plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon. He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities. In 28BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, M-35 from Negaunee to Big Bay to L'Anse {{was officially}} {{canceled}} {{as a state}} trunkline highway. Constructed portions were turned over to local control, becoming Skanee Road in Baraga County and CR510 in Marquette County. This left a discontinuous routing for 13years. The southern segment of M-35 ran from Menominee to Negaunee, and the northern segment ran from Baraga to Ontonagon along the modern M-38. The two segments were rejoined in 1953, closing the gap left by the cancelled Huron Mountain route. M-35 signs were added to existing highway signs westward {{from the end of}} the southern segment at Negaunee along US41/M-28 and US41 to Baraga, to <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> northern segment westward to Ontonagon.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{construction}} began {{on a new}} arterial highway—known as the North–South Arterial—through downtown Utica. The first portion of the highway to open was the segment between River Road and Trenton Road, which was completed by 1956. It was extended southward to Oriskany Street (NY5A) by 1961 and completed entirely by 1964; however, NY8 was not initially realigned to follow the highway. In the mid-1960s, plans were made to construct a new limited-access highway along the NY8 corridor from Clayville north to New Hartford, where it would <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> North–South Arterial.|$|E
