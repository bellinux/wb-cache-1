5|$|Republican Rep. Joe Stengel was term-limited in 2006 and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> for {{re-election}} to the Colorado House of Representatives from House District 38; both Rice and Republican Matt Dunn sought election to Stengel's house seat. The race {{was a top}} target for the Colorado GOP, who unsuccessfully {{tried to keep the}} seat in Republican hands during a year where Republicans lost ground both nationally and in Colorado.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) reluctantly {{responds}} to Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) call on Christmas Eve {{to investigate a}} haunted house in Maryland. He explains that during Christmas of 1917, a young couple {{living in the house}} agreed to a lovers' pact, one killing the other and the remaining one committing suicide. He explains that they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> the thought of being alone after the other died and during the afterlife; they wanted to spend all eternity together. Now, Mulder claims, they haunt the house every Christmas Eve.|$|E
5|$|On 29 May 2000, Suharto {{was placed}} {{under house arrest}} when Indonesian {{authorities}} began to investigate the corruption during his presidency. In July 2000, {{it was announced that}} he was to be accused of embezzling US$571 million of government donations to {{one of a number of}} foundations under his control and then using the money to finance family investments. But in September court-appointed doctors announced that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> trial because of his declining health. State prosecutors tried again in 2002 but then doctors cited an unspecified brain disease. On 26 March 2008, a civil court judge acquitted Suharto of corruption but ordered his charitable foundation, Supersemar, to pay US$110m (£55m).|$|E
60|$|Decidedly, I <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> <b>stand</b> it; without {{responding}} I gave {{my hand to}} Caroline Spencer. She {{looked at}} me an instant with her little white face and expanded eyes, and as she showed her pretty teeth I suppose she meant to smile.|$|R

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{construction}} of Test Track, numerous problems occurred causing delays in the ride opening. One problem that Imagineers had to overcome was that the wheels used on the ride vehicles <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> up to the demand of the ride course and speed. This problem was resolved but a second, more severe problem caused the ride to be delayed by over a year. In order for Test Track to run with the highest hourly capacity possible, twenty-nine ride vehicles would be needed. The ride programming system could only handle operating a maximum of six cars over the layout of the ride. One by one, programmers were able to get the computer system able to run twenty-nine ride vehicles all at once. After these problems were resolved, Test Track soft-opened to the public on December 19, 1998. The ride was still prone to breakdowns and didn't officially open until March 17, 1997.|$|E
5|$|Brothers Robert and Dennis Skotak {{were hired}} to {{supervise}} the visual effects, having previously worked with Cameron on several Roger Corman movies. Two stages were used to construct the colony on LV-426, using miniature models that were on average six feet tall and three feet wide. Filming the miniatures was difficult because of the weather; the wind would blow over the props; however, it proved helpful to give the effect of weather on the planet. Cameron used these miniatures and several effects to make scenes look larger than they really were, including rear projection, mirrors, beam splitters, camera splits and foreground miniatures. Due to budget limits, Cameron {{said he had to}} pay for the robotic arm used to cut into Ripley's shuttle in the opening scene. Practical effects supervisor John Richardson (who won a special effects Oscar for his part in the film) declared his biggest challenge was creating the forklift power loader exoskeletons, which required only three months of work and had Cameron complaining about visual details during construction. The model <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> on its own, requiring either wires dangling from the shoulders or a pole through the back attached to a crane. While Sigourney Weaver was inside the power loader model, a stunt man standing behind it would move the arms and legs.|$|E
5|$|Haakon's councillors {{had sought}} to {{reconcile}} Haakon and Skule by proposing marriage between Haakon and Skule's daughter Margrete in 1219. Haakon accepted the proposal (although {{he did not think}} it would change much politically), but the marriage between Haakon and Margrete did not take place before 1225, partly due to the conflict with Ribbung. The relationship between Haakon and Skule nevertheless deteriorated further during the 1230s, and attempts of settlements at meetings in 1233 and 1236 only distanced them more from each other. Periodically, the two nonetheless reconciled and spent a great amount of time together, only to have their friendship destroyed, according to the saga by intrigues derived from rumours and slander by men who played the two against each other. Skule was the first person ever in Norway to be titled Duke (hertug) in 1237, but instead of control over a region gained the rights to the incomes from a third of the syssels scattered across the whole of Norway. This was part of an attempt by Haakon to limit Skule's power. In 1239 the conflict between the two erupted into open warfare when Skule had himself proclaimed king. Although he had some support in Trøndelag, Opplandene and in eastern Viken, he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> up to Haakon's forces. The rebellion ended when Skule was killed in 1240, leaving Haakon the undisputed king of Norway. This revolt is generally taken to mark the final end of Norway's civil war era.|$|E

5|$|The highest {{promoted}} match, {{second only}} to the main event in importance, scheduled for Victory Road was between the tag team pairings of America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) (AMW) and Triple X (Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper) (XXX), with them competing in an Elimination Last Team Standing match. In this match, the teams fought each other until both members of one team <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> up before the referee counted to ten. The build up to this match began on the previous weekly PPV, when Storm was not cleared to wrestle so XXX took AMW's place in challenging for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. Daniels was injured early in the evening after a scripted assault by The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens). Harris was written into the plotline to replace Daniels in challenging and defeating The Naturals for the tag team championship at the PPV. On the September 24 episode of Impact!, Daniels and Storm were forced to team together and challenge Skipper and Harris for the championship, which they were successful in winning. Storm and Daniels later lost the championship to Team Canada (Bobby Roode and Eric Young) on the October 15 episode of Impact!. Harris and Storm then re-joined together to continue as AMW, while Daniels and Skipper did the same as XXX. After a few brawls between the two teams on Impact!, AMW challenged XXX to a Last Team Standing match at Victory Road on the October 29 episode of Impact!.|$|E

25|$|While three {{inspectors}} {{from the}} League of Nations Committee {{were sent to}} the region to oversee the situation in 1924, the Sheikh Said rebellion, beginning in 1924 and escalating until 1927, set out to establish a new government positioned to cut Turkey's link to Mesopotamia. The relationship between the rebels and Britain was questioned. British assistance was sought after the rebels realised that the rebellion, or its expected outcome, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> by itself.|$|E
25|$|But overweening vanity {{formed a}} strong part of Cruikshank's character.

Had he been connected with Fielding, he would no doubt have asserted that he wrote a great portion of Tom Jones. Moreover, he was excessively troublesome and obtrusive in his suggestions.

25|$|Clifford {{stated that}} what motivates him {{was much more}} than just money - he said he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> {{hypocrisy}} in public life, reserved a particular disgust for lying politicians, and watched with growing anger what he thought happened to the NHS over the past 20 years. For this reason, and because of his working class background, Clifford was a traditional Labour supporter who worked to bring down the government of John Major because he felt that the National Health Service was being mismanaged.|$|E
25|$|Wuornos told several {{inconsistent}} {{stories about}} the killings. She claimed initially that all seven men had raped her while she {{was working as a}} prostitute but later recanted the claim of self-defense, citing robbery and a desire to leave no witnesses as the reason for murder. During an interview with filmmaker Nick Broomfield, when she thought the cameras were off, she told him that it was, in fact, self-defense, but she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> being on death row—where she had been for ten years at that point—and wanted to die.|$|E
25|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1990, {{opposition}} to Thatcher's policies on local government taxation, her Government's perceived mishandling of the economy (especially high interest rates of 15%, which were undermining her core voting base within the home-owning, entrepreneurial and business sectors), and the divisions opening within her party over the appropriate handling of European integration made her and her party seem increasingly politically vulnerable. Her increasingly combative, irritable personality also made opposition to her grow fast and by this point, even many in her own party <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> her.|$|E

25|$|Most of the English kingdoms, {{being in}} turmoil, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> against the Vikings, but King Alfred of Wessex {{defeated}} Guthrum's army at the Battle of Edington in 878. There followed the Treaty of Wedmore {{the same year}} and the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum in 886. These treaties formalised {{the boundaries of the}} English kingdoms and the Viking Danelaw territory, with provisions for peaceful relations between the English and the Vikings. Despite these treaties, conflict continued on and off. However, Alfred and his successors eventually drove back the Viking frontier and retook York.|$|E
25|$|Even with Naresuan's reforms, the {{effectiveness}} of the royal government over the next 150 years was unstable. Royal power outside the crown lands-—although in theory absolute—was in practice limited by the looseness of the civil administration. The influence of central government and the king was not extensive beyond the capital. When war with the Burmese broke out in late eighteenth century, provinces easily abandoned the capital. As the enforcing troops were not easily rallied to defend the capital, the city of Ayutthaya <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> against the Burmese aggressors.|$|E
25|$|However, {{recent studies}} suggest many problems. Although the Paraguayan army had between 70,000 and 100,000 {{men at the}} {{beginning}} of the conflict, they were badly equipped. Most infantry armaments consisted of inaccurate smooth-bore muskets and carbines, slow to reload and short-ranged. The artillery was similarly poor. Military officers had no training or experience, and there was no command system, as all decisions were made personally by López. Food, ammunition and armaments were scarce, with logistics and hospital care deficient or nonexistent. The nation of about 450,000 people <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> against the Triple Alliance of 11 million people.|$|E
