50|$|In 1982 the USDA {{ordered that}} {{imported}} Niger seed must be heat sterilized {{to kill the}} contaminant dodder seed. This treatment, however, was insufficient to kill seeds of other Federal noxious weeds, including Asphodelus fistulosus (onion weed), Digitaria spp. (includes African <b>couchgrass),</b> Oryza spp. (red rice), Paspalum scrobiculatum (kodo millet), Prosopis spp. (includes mesquites), Solanum viarum (tropical soda apple), Striga spp. (witchweed), and Urochloa panicoides (liver-seed grass). In 2001 a new treatment required that imported Niger seed must be heat treated at 120 °C (248 °F) for 15 minutes.|$|E
40|$|Wet storage (sprinkling) of wood offers {{valuable}} {{protection against}} drying out and biological attack, {{but at the}} same time there are disadvantages to be considered. Negative effects in the forms of reduction in wood quality and the environmental impact of log yard run-off must be minimised in order to make wet storage effective. In the work underlying this thesis, the effect of different sprinkling water qualities on changes in wood properties during storage was studied. A new method for treating log yard run-off by using it to irrigate soil-plant systems was also evaluated. Sprinkling experiments were conducted both indoors and outdoors in which the effects of sprinkling on the wood quality of Norway spruce (Picea abies) pulpwood piles were examined. Soil-plant systems with willows (Salix schwerinii x Salix viminalis), alder (Alnus glutinosa) and <b>couchgrass</b> (Elymus repens) were irrigated with Norway spruce log yard run-off and evaluated both in lysimeters and in the field (<b>couchgrass)</b> for their purification capacity. Sprinkling water quality, in terms of salinity, did not affect the inorganic content of wood during storage. Brackish waters can be used without increasing the risk for raising the inorganic contents. Neither did sprinkling with fresh or recycled water affect wood brightness. Factors other than those studied determine the optimal wet storage regime. The composition of different log yard run-offs is very different, but they are all rich in oxygen-consuming organic material. Irrigation of soil-plant systems purifies log yard run-off even at very high irrigation intensities and is a convenient method for practical use. The irrigation intensity, rather than the soil type or plant species, is the major factor for the efficiency since lower intensities lead to both better purification and greater possibilities for long-term sustainability...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} investigations: {{the seeds of}} the wild-growing and sort samples of species of multi-year kin <b>Couchgrass</b> (Elymus L.), the tribes wheat (Triticeae Dum.) : couch grass Siberian (Elymus sibiricus), couch grass rough-stem (E. trachycaulus), couch grass new-English (E. novae-angliae) and some other species with the differing genome constitution. The purpose of the work: the electrophoretic study of {{variation}} and specificity of the reserve proteins of the couch grass endosperm as compared with other representatives of the tribe. The method of extraction of the minor cowpea weevils endosperm proteins, being in the base of the electrophoretic method of identification of the multi-year cereals genotypes of the wheat tribe has been developed. The multiple allelism of genes, controlling the prolamin-gluteline complex of the multi-year cereals, has been shown. The electrophoretic spectres of the reserve proteins reflect the genome constitution and, mainly, the type of the taxons pollination. The results of the work can be used in the field of introduction of the food grasses, biosystematics and the populated geneticsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|After {{more than}} 30 {{years in which}} ‘Tifgreen’ and ‘Tifdwarf’ were the only greens-quality {{varieties}} available, the choice for golf courses and bowls clubs in northern Australia has been expanded to include six new Cynodon hybrids [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers x Cynodon transvaalensis Burtt-Davy]. Five of these – ‘Champion Dwarf’ (Texas), ‘MS-Supreme’ (Mississippi), FloraDwarf™ (Florida), ‘TifEagle’ (Georgia), MiniVerde™ (Arizona) - are from US breeding programs, while the sixth, ‘TL 2 ’ (marketed as Novotek™) was selected in north Queensland. The finer, denser and lower growing habit of the “ultradwarf” cultivars allows very low mowing heights (e. g. 2. 5 mm) to be imposed, resulting in denser and smoother putting and bowls surfaces. In addition to the Cynodon hybrids, four new greens quality seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum O. Swartz) cultivars including ‘Sea Isle 2000 ’, Sea Isle Supreme™, Velvetene™ and Sea Dwarf™ (where tolerance of salty water is required) expands the range of choices for greens in difficult environments. The project was developed to determine (a) the appropriate choice of cultivar for different environments and budgets, and (b) best management practices for the new cultivars which differ from the Cynodon hybrid industry standards ‘Tifgreen’ and ‘Tifdwarf’. Management practices, particularly fertilising, mowing heights and frequency, and thatch control were investigated to determine optimum management inputs and provide high quality playing surfaces with the new grasses. To enable effective trialling of these new and old cultivars it was essential to {{have a number of}} regional sites participating in the study. Drought and financial hardship of many clubs presented an initial setback with numerous clubs wanting {{to be involved in the}} study but were unable to commit due to their financial position at the time. The study was fortunate to have seven regional sites from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia volunteer to be involved in the study which would add to the results being collected at the centralised test facility being constructed at DEEDI’s Redlands Research Station. The major research findings acquired from the eight trial sites included: •	All of the new second generation “ultradwarf” couchgrasses tend to produce a large amount of thatch with MiniVerde™ being the greatest thatch producer, particularly compared to ‘Tifdwarf’ and ‘Tifgreen’. The maintenance of the new Cynodon hybrids will require a program of regular dethatching/grooming as well as regular light dustings of sand. Thatch prevention should begin 3 to 4 weeks after planting a new “ultradwarf” <b>couchgrass</b> green, with an emphasis on prevention rather than control. •	The “ultradwarfs” produced faster green speeds than the current industry standards ‘Tifgreen’ and ‘Tifdwarf’. However, all Cynodon hybrids were considerably faster than the seashore paspalums (e. g. comparable to the speed diference of Bentgrass and <b>couchgrass)</b> under trial conditions. Green speed was fastest being cut at 3. 5 mm and rolled (compared to 3. 5 mm cut, no roll and 2. 7 mm cut, no roll). •	All trial sites reported the occurrence of disease in the Cynodon hybrids with the main incidence of disease occurring during the dormancy period (autumn and winter). The main disease issue reported was “patch diseases” which includes both Gaumannomyces and Rhizoctonia species. There was differences in the severity of the disease between cultivars, however, the severity of the disease was not consistent between cultivars and is largely attributed to an environment (location) effect. In terms of managing the occurrence of disease, the incidence of disease is less severe where there is a higher fertility rate (about 3 kgN/ 100 m 2 /year) or a preventitatve fungicide program is adopted. •	Cynodon hybrid and seashore paspalum cultivars maintained an acceptable to ideal surface being cut between 2. 7 mm and 5. 0 mm. “Ultradwarf” cultivars can tolerate mowing heights as low as 2. 5 mm for short periods but places the plant under high levels of stress. Greens being maintained at a continually lower cutting height (e. g. 2. 7 mm) of both species is achievable, but would need to be cut daily for best results. Seashore paspalums performed best when cut at a height of between 2. 7 mm and 3. 0 mm. If a lower cutting height is adopted, regular and repeated mowings are required to reduce scalping and produce a smooth surface. •	At this point in time the optimum rate of nitrogen (N) for the Cynodon hybrids is 3 kg/ 100 m 2 /year and while the seashore paspalums is 2 to 3 kg/ 100 m 2 /year. •	Dormancy occurred for all Cynodon and seashore paspalum culitvars from north in Brisbane (QLD) to south in Mornington Peninsula (VIC) and west to Novar Gardens (SA). Cynodon and Paspalum growth in both Victoria and South Australia was less favourable as a result of the cooler climates. •	After combining the data collected from all eight sites, the results indicated that there can be variation (e. g. turfgrass quality, colour, disease resistance, performace) depending on the site and climatic conditions. Such evidence highlights the need to undertake genotype by environment (G x E) studies on new and old cultivars prior to conversion or establishment. •	For a club looking to select either a Cynodon hybrid or seashore paspalum cultivar for use at their club they need to: - Review the research data. - Look at trial plots. - Inspect greens in play that have the new grasses. - Select 2 to 3 cultivars that are considered to be the better types. - Establish them in large (large enough to putt on) plots/nursery/practice putter. Ideally the area should be subjected to wear. - Maintain them exactly as they would be on the golf course/lawn bowls green. This is a critical aspect. Regular mowing, fertilising etc. is essential. - Assess them over at least 2 to 3 years. - Make a selection and establish it in a playing green so that it is subjected to typical wear. ...|$|E
