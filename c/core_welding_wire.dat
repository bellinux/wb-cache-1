Welded joints exhibited different corrosion potential due to the dilutions of alloy elements such as Cr, Ni, Ti, Nb and Mo. To reveal the corrosion resistance of welded joints using different welding processes, some significant characterization parameters such as Ecorr, Eb, △E and Icorr in polarisation curves were analyzed and compared.

The column reinforcement consisted of only <b>welded</b> <b>wire</b> fabric, {{without the use of}} any reinforcing bars. The increase in confinement was relatively small. The ductility enhancement was also limited. It was concluded that, unless special size <b>welded</b> <b>wire</b> fabric was used to have adequate percentage of steel, the standard size mesh was not suitable for use as column reinforcement. The test results were compared against analytical predictions obtained from the use of Saatcioglu and Razvi model for confined concrete.

30|$|The beams {{reinforced}} with <b>welded</b> <b>wire</b> mesh achieved better cracking performance than those {{reinforced with}} X 8 expanded steel mesh {{regardless of the}} number of reinforcing steel layers and the type of core material.

The better performance of the beams reinforced with <b>welded</b> <b>wire</b> mesh could be attributed to the material properties of the two types of steel meshes which resulted in higher tensile strength of the mortar-mesh composite for the case of <b>welded</b> <b>wire</b> mesh in comparison to that of the X 8 expanded steel mesh as explained in Eqs.

Surfacing of Fe-Al {{alloy layer}} is {{achieved}} {{on the surface}} of Q 235 steel plate by using the twin wire consisting of one aluminum <b>welding</b> <b>wire</b> and one steel <b>welding</b> <b>wire</b> in the shielding of pure argon. When the ER 1100 aluminum <b>welding</b> <b>wire</b> of Φ 1. 6 mm and ER 50 - 6 steel <b>welding</b> <b>wire</b> of Φ 1. 2 mm are selected as the master wire and slave wire respectively, with preheating and interlayer temperature reaching 350 ℃ by controlling filling volume of aluminum and steel, the Fe-Al alloy layer featured by well-formed welding line is thus gained with no macroscopic defect. As the mechanical performance testing shows, the shear strength of surface combining surfacing layer and steel substrate is higher than 270 MPa. The rupture position is located in surfacing layer and {{it turns out to be}} brittle fracture; the micro-hardness of surfacing layer ranges from 320 HV to 420 HV. Abrasion resistance testing indicates that abrasion resistance of surfacing layer is better than that of base material. According to micro-structure observation, the welding line is a coarsening columnar structure with a great deal of precipitated phase. According to EDAX, the aluminum content of precipitated phase in surfacing layer ranges from 24 % to 32 % (at), and the steel content ranging from 76 % to 68 % (at) - it is thus considered a Fe 3 Al structure through XRD.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2016 Modernization and {{industrialization}} have {{paved the}} way for the construction industry of India to expand. On the other hand the Indian construction industry is set to face an acute workforce shortage. The shortage of construction workers has in fact slowed down the growth of this industry in major cities across the country and escalated its cost by 40 percent. An alternative way to replace the labor force is by automation techniques. This study is a numerical analysis to evaluate structural behavior of simply supported concrete beams reinforced with <b>welded</b> <b>wires</b> in comparison with mild steel reinforced concrete beams. Welding conventional steel bars (60 ksi) reduces their shear strength by 50 percent. <b>Welded</b> <b>Wire</b> Reinforcement (80 ksi), with its greater strength, higher durability, significantly lower placing and overall cost, provides an alternative and perhaps a better substitution for mild steel bars. The commercial finite element analysis program, ABAQUS, was used to model the non-linear behavior of reinforced concrete beams. In order to evaluate the structural behavior of <b>welded</b> <b>wire</b> reinforced concrete beams, different configurations of longitudinal and transverse wires have been considered. First, different types of stirrup configurations in a rectangular reinforced concrete beam are compared with a conventional reinforced beam. Second, a structurally performing <b>welded</b> <b>wire</b> configuration is compared with a Mexican chair styled reinforcement configuration.
