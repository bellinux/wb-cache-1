40|$|The Strip Algorithm (SA) is a {{constructive}} heuristic {{which has been}} tried on the Euclidean Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and other planar network problems with some success. Its attraction is its efficiency. In its simplest form, it can find tours of length Ω (n−−√) in O (n log n) operations where n {{is the number of}} nodes. Here, we set out to investigate new variants such as the 2 -Part Strip Algorithm (2 -PSA), the Spiral Strip Algorithm (SSA) and the Adaptive Strip Algorithm (ASA). The latter is particularly suited for Euclidean TSPs with non-uniform distribution of cities across the grid; i. e problems with <b>clustered</b> <b>cities.</b> These cases present an overall low density, but high localised densities. ASA takes this into account in that smaller strips are generated where the density is high. All three algorithms are analysed, implemented and computationally tested against each other and the Classical Strip Algorithm. Computational results are included...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. As the {{urbanization}} {{of cities}} is rapidly developing in China, metropolitan regions establish the clustered power network planning scheme on {{the background of}} the clustered city planning of the adjacent areas. Base on the functional orientation and difference of clusters, as well as the theory of hierarchical clustered city planning, the article puts forward the power network planning thoughts and methods. As cluster becomes a planning unit, the load density method is applied in the differential load forecast and the location of substations as well as the path of transmission lines is selected with the thoughts of separation according to different layers and areas. And then, the results will be compared and verified with the planning scheme of the other <b>clustered</b> <b>cities</b> which have the similar function orientation and planning strategy. Finally, the planning methods will be standardized. The application in the power network of Cluster of Livable Education City in Zhengzhou has proved that the methods and steps of the power planning method proposed is able to meet the demand of the network development under the situation of the rapid growth of load...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with novel Nature-Inspired heuristics for the so called NP-hard problems of optimisation. A particular algorithm which has been recently introduced and shown {{to be effective in}} continuous optimisation is the Plant Propagation Algorithm or PPA. Here, we intend to extend it to cope with combinatorial optimisation. In order to show that our extension is viable and effective, we consider three types of problems which are good representatives of the whole topic. These are the Travelling Salesman Problem or TSP, the Knapsack Problem or KP and the scheduling problem of Berth Allocation as arises in container ports or BAP. Because PPA is a population-based search heuristic, we devote a chapter to the important issue of generating good and yet computationally relatively light initial populations of solutions to kick start the search process. In the case of the TSP we revisit and extend the Strip Algorithm (SA). We introduce the 2 -Part SA and show that it is better than the classical SA. We also introduce new variants such as the Adaptive SA and the Spiral SA which cope with <b>clustered</b> <b>cities</b> and instances with cities concentrated around the center of the unit square, respectively. In the case of KP we adapt the Roulette Wheel selection approach to generate solutions to start with PPA. And in the case of BAP, we introduce a number of simple heuristics which consider a schedule as a flat box with one side being the processing time and the other the position of vessels on the wharf. The heuristics try to generate schedules by avoiding overlap as much as possible. All approaches and algorithms are implemented and tested against well established algorithms. The results are recorded and discussed extensively. The thesis ends with a conclusion and ideas for further research...|$|E

40|$|En Caracas, como en la mayoría de las ciudades socialmente segregadas, la distribución modal del transporte está muy {{relacionada con}} los ingresos. El objetivo de este trabajo es proporcionar una explicación cuantitativa del fenómeno, identificar de las {{variables}} sociológicas que han provocado los cambios observados en la elección entre modos de transporte para la clase de ingresos más altos y establecer la influencia de la promoción del metro y de autobús de metro en este comportamiento. El análisis de los datos recogidos por CA Metro sobre la distribución modal de los ingresos muestra la existencia de una fuerte correlación entre la calidad del transporte público y la distribución del ingreso de los usuarios, que no puede explicarse sólo por las tarifas. La serie de datos recopilados en los últimos años permiten un análisis econométrico de la evolución de la tendencia. Una serie de entrevistas con el metro y los administradores de metro-bus, así como sociólogos y psicólogos sociales han ayudado a identificar las variables sociológicas de mayor influencia en el comportamiento de viaje de la población de altos ingresos y los atributos de calidad de metro y autobús de metro con más atractivo. Los resultados podrían ser indicativos de cómo las políticas de éxito para inducir un cambio en la elección modal de los vehículos al transporte público, podría ser aplicado incluso en ciudades donde la segregación social es extrema. In Caracas, {{as in most}} socially <b>clustered</b> <b>cities,</b> modal split is highly related to income. High income population is mostly car dependant, while lower income people are captive of public transport. This typical situation is explained by world-wide social values and fashion {{but also by the}} fact that new, segregated residential areas for the upper social levels have been located in areas poorly served by public transport, creating a dependency on the private car. It is not surprising that, during the 1970 's, a high proportion of Caracas's middle and high-income citizens were systematically using their car even in areas where there was a good offer of public transport. What is more unusual is to realise that, since 1983 when the metro system was inaugurated, there is a new pattern of travel behaviour. The metro has mainly attracted high-income people. Besides the few of them who have transferred from surface to underground public transport, many of the wealthier patrons seem to be regular car users that presently take the metro when it provides a good alternative. Currently, the transit system in Caracas is comprised of four main modes: the metro (since 1983); the "por puesto", which are minibus vehicles of 18 to 32 seats; the jeeps, which are dual traction vehicles of up to 12 seat (most of them serving hilly areas, basically slums); and the bus system, consisting of metro-bus and private operators. CA Metro operates the metro and, since 1987, metro-bus lines, which are bus feeder services to its heavy rail metro operation that extend the cover area of the system into the less central zones of the city. While the metro and metro-bus offer transit services to middle and high income users, the mini-buses and jeeps provide flexible transit service to low income groups. The metro and metro-bus services are more reliable and offer higher quality that mini-buses and jeeps. This higher quality service {{is one of the main}} attributes attracting the wealthier people to metro and metro-bus. Also, since the inauguration of the metro, a strong advertising of the service has been promoting its use and creating a different civic behaviour of the system's users. It is well known in Caracas that local people are much more civilised when underground". The aim of the paper is to provide a quantitative explanation of the phenomenon, identifying the sociological variables that have induced the observed changes in modal choice for the higher income class and establishing the influence of the promotion of the metro and metro-bus services in this behaviour. The analysis of the data collected by CA Metro on modal split by income show the existence of a strong correlation between the quality of public transport and the income distribution of users, which can not be explained by tariffs only. The series of data collected over the years allow an econometric analysis of the evolution of the trend. A series of interviews with metro and metro-bus managers, as well as sociologists and social psychologists have helped identify the sociological variables with the highest influence in the travel behaviour of high income population and those quality attributes of metro and metro-bus with most attractiveness. The results could be indicative on how successful policies to induce a change in modal choice from cars to public transport could be implemented even in cities where social segregation is extreme...|$|E

30|$|A <b>city</b> <b>cluster</b> {{is defined}} as a group of cities that are {{geographically}} colocated and linked by interdependencies in improving their competitiveness and economic development. In modern China, the collective economic capacity and interdependency of <b>city</b> <b>clusters</b> have influenced regional and national social and economic development (Shao et al. 2006; Zhang 2009). The role of <b>city</b> <b>clusters</b> can be seen in many aspects: comprising only 25 % of China’s total area, the 23 <b>city</b> <b>clusters</b> concentrated 62 % of the Chinese population, 80 % of the national GDP, 70 % of investment in fixed assets, 76 % of total retail sales of social consumer goods, and 85 % of college students in 2012. Overall planning for and development of industries, markets, the environment, infrastructure, and social security have been relatively integrated in each <b>city</b> <b>cluster</b> (Fang et al. 2005; Fang 2014). Particularly in recent years, a large number of government policies have been formulated that target the coordinated and integrated development of urban agglomerations and <b>city</b> <b>clusters</b> due to their spatial proximity, economic connections, and the shared climate, environment, culture, and development potential among <b>cities</b> within these <b>clusters.</b> The increasing impact of climate disasters on China’s urban areas, especially in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), the Pearl River Delta (PRD), and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region of eastern China and other densely populated urban areas and industrial clusters (Dong et al. 2010; Du et al. 2013), makes it important to examine regional differences in health impacts in order to facilitate the development of regional risk reduction strategies and policies. In contrast to a focus on individual cities, comparison of <b>city</b> <b>clusters</b> as aggregated units of analysis offers a unique advantage for investigating issues and impacts driven by regional scale events, such as climate extremes.|$|R
