40|$|As the {{diversity}} of the United States voting population has increased, many have debated how American political and legal structures can best incorporate citizens with limited English proficiency (2 ̆ 2 LEP 2 ̆ 2) into the electoral system. Some argue that government-provided language accommodations are necessary to ensure that all citizens can exercise their right to vote. Others expect that all citizens should be sufficiently proficient in English if they choose to vote, or should rely on their families, linguistic communities, or political campaigns for assistance. This Article argues for the necessity of accommodations that reach all LEP voters and incorporate them into the electoral system. It offers a detailed critique of current federal and state accommodationist policies and proposes a flexible legal infrastructure to address existing inadequacies in government protections. The proposed model—assistance by federally <b>certified</b> <b>translators,</b> increased involvement of LEP community groups and organizations in determining the extent of coverage under federal law, and improved enforcement of court orders by federal courts—is an attempt to seek accommodations that are tailored to serve all voters who require language assistance in order to act as equal participants in our American democracy...|$|R
30|$|The aim was {{to develop}} a conceptually {{equivalent}} translation written in contemporary Swedish. The translation process included: two forward translations performed independently by two native Swedish speaking, <b>certified</b> <b>translators</b> from a professional translation agency (TransPerfect Ltd., NY, USA); reconciliation of the forward translations and cultural adaptations by an expert review panel; a back translation from Swedish to English by a native English speaking, certified translator; and finally a reconciliation of the final version based on results of the back translation [13]. Discrepancies or problems in the translation were resolved by discussions between the translator, back-translator and the expert review panel. The panel consisted of researchers experienced in questionnaire development and PROMs with special insight into respondents’ difficulties in responding to the SF- 36 [14]. A special feature in this translation process is the fact that a Swedish version of the SF- 36 already exists, translated in cooperation with the creator of SF- 36, John Ware, and culturally adapted using IQOLA methodology [7]. Although the original English versions of SF- 36 and RAND- 36 are identical, a new translation is bound to differ from an existing translation. To ensure that these differences did not impact on the content validity of the questionnaire, comparisons with the Swedish version of the SF- 36 were made throughout the translation process.|$|R

40|$|Background: Dyspnoea, {{the feeling}} of {{breathing}} discomfort, consists of multiple dimensions that can vary in intensity, including the level of unpleasantness, qualities or descriptors of the sensation, emotional responses, and impact on function. No validated instrument for multidimensional measurement of dyspnoea is available in Swedish. The Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP) was recently developed to measure the unpleasantness, sensory qualities, and emotional responses of dyspnoea across diseases and settings. We aimed to take forward a Swedish version of the MDP. Methods: Translation and linguistic validation of the MDP was conducted in collaboration with a specialised company in the field (Mapi, Lyon, France). The structured process involved forward and backward translations by two independent <b>certified</b> <b>translators,</b> input from an in-country linguistic consultant, the developers, and three respiratory physicians. Understandability and acceptability were evaluated through in-depth interviews with five patients with dyspnoea in accordance with international guidelines. Results and Conclusion: A Swedish version of the MDP was obtained and linguistically validated. The MDP includes 11 rated items: the immediate unpleasantness of the sensation, the presence and intensity of five sensory qualities, {{and the intensity of}} five emotional responses to dyspnoea. The time period of measurement is specified by the user. The MDP is copyrighted by the developers but can be used free of charge in the context of non-funded academic research. Conclusion: The MDP is the first instrument for measuring multiple dimensions of dyspnoea available in Swedish and should be validated across diseases and settings. Multidimensional measurement is essential for improved assessment and management of dyspnoea in research and clinical care...|$|R

40|$|Vietnam is a South East Asian {{country which}} has been immensely {{influenced}} by Confucian ideology. This heritage has been transferred down through generations, and has greatly affected {{the development of the}} love of learning in Vietnamese intellectually gifted adolescents. Furthermore, moral reasoning has been found to differ between gifted students and students not identified as gifted in Western studies. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to compare two groups (Vietnamese gifted students and those not identified as gifted) in terms of the adoption of Confucian values and moral reasoning. A total of 354 high school students (intellectually gifted adolescents = 50. 6 %, and students not identified as gifted = 49. 4 %) participated in a survey containing 40 items selected from previous studies published in scholarly English journals on the adoption of Confucian values in various cultural settings. To measure moral reasoning, the Defining Issues Test, a psychometric test with high reliability and validity widely used in Western cultures, was utilised in this study. The two research instruments were translated into Vietnamese by two NAATI (National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters) - <b>certified</b> <b>translators</b> and back-translated into English to ensure their accuracy. Exploratory factor analysis using oblique rotation (SPSS 18. 0) eliminated six items and yielded four correlated factors with high factor loadings: (1) harmony based on ethical conduct, (2) conservativeness, (3) social responsibility, and (4) self-control. These four factors constitute a scale to measure Confucian values in Vietnam as well as other countries in East Asian regions or to assess the extent of the influence of Confucianism on migrant students with East Asian backgrounds. Additionally, a multivariate analysis of variance revealed that Vietnamese intellectually gifted adolescents expressed higher levels of social responsibility, self-control, and moral reasoning than their age-peers who were not identified as gifted. Although both groups endorsed harmony with ethical conduct, the gifted students appeared to be less conservative. The above-mentioned features by Vietnamese gifted adolescents are considered Neo-Confucianism, an adaptive version of Confucianism in modern time. Implications of the study have been provided to school teachers, parents, counsellors, principals and policy makers, and especially to the gifted students...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is {{customary}} {{to write}} performance-critical parts of arithmetic functions in assembly: this enables finely-tuned algorithms that use specialized processor instructions. However, such optimizations make formal verification of arithmetic functions technically challenging, {{mainly because of}} many bit-level manipulations of data.

It consists in the implementation in the Coq proof assistant of (1) a Hoare logic for assembly programs augmented with loops and (2) a <b>certified</b> <b>translator</b> to ready-to-run assembly with jumps. To properly handle formal verification of bit-level manipulations of data, we propose an original encoding of machine integers. For concreteness, we use the SmartMIPS assembly language, {{an extension of the}} MIPS instruction set for smartcards, and we explain the formal verification of an optimized implementation of the Montgomery multiplication, a de facto-standard for the implementation of many cryptosystems. ...|$|E

After the translation of the questionnaire by a <b>certified</b> <b>translator,</b> and after its cultural adaptation, it was applied in eight patients {{in order to identify}} the difficulties and doubts related {{to an understanding of the}} questions and of its terminology, not only to evaluate the quality of the translation, but to verify practical aspects of its application, as well. Afterward, a second translation was done from Spanish to English, and sent back to the authors to ensure the original content of the questionnaire was maintained, and to obtain endorsement for its use. Results: During the cultural adaptation phase, the sample was constituted by 6 men and 2 women, with an average age of 61 years. The Spa-nish version of the LINQ, as well as the cultural adaptation, was easy to use and did not show any discrepancies with the original version during the re-translation process. Conclusions: The LINQ’s translation to Spanish and the cultural adaptation proved to be adequate, because the patients did not express any difficulties in understanding and answering the questions.

40|$|Numerous Thai {{older people}} fall each year. Although {{it has been}} shown that only 3. 1 % of fallers {{sustained}} fractures (Nevitt, Cumming, Kidd, & Black, 1989), injuries in older people are often more serious. For example, hospital charges for older adult fall injuries are about US $ 2, 000 per person higher than for young fallers (Ellis & Trent, 2001). Moreover, falling can lead to social isolation, physical restraint, disability and institutionalisation (Donald & Bulpitt, 1999; Tideiksaar, 1994). Therefore falling in old age results in a considerable burden on, not only the individual concerned, but also the whole society. Internationally, a successful falls prevention program usually employs a multidimensional approaches (Alexander & Edelberg, 2002; Mosley, Galindo- Ciocon, Peak, & West, 1998). However, limited information about fall prevention has been reported in Thailand. A survey indicated that Thai elderly fall outside their homes which is different from the findings in Western countries (Jitapunkul et al., 1998). This suggests that adoption of fall prevention strategies from Western countries might not be successful in Thailand. Prior to this study, details of fall circumstances in terms of location, time, associated activity, hazards and type of falls in Thai older people were not available. Moreover, there was no information about fear of falling and activity restriction. These are important fall consequences that impact on quality of life and themselves are risk factors for falls. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of fear of falling, and to describe activity restriction in fallers and non-fallers, and the circumstances associated with falls in Thailand. No fear of falling measurement tools for Thai older people were available prior to the study. Therefore the Survey of Activities and Fear of Falling in the elderly (SAFE) has been modified for use with Thai elderly people. The SAFE was translated to Thai by a <b>certified</b> <b>translator,</b> checked for cultural relevance and back-translated by a second translator; reliability testing then took place in Thailand. Face validity and cultural appropriateness were tested with a sample of convenience of 10 bilingual Thai elderly people living in Perth, Australia. After translation into Thai, 4 items showed less than 80 % agreement and required adjustment to capture the equivalent meaning of the original version. The ‘take a show/wash yourself with a basin of water’ was added because the participants reported that taking a tub bath is not common or traditional in Thailand. However, the item ‘take a tub bath’ was retained until the examination in the main study confirmed that less than 1 % of Thai older persons had taken a tub bath and inclusion of the item confounded actual fear of falling results. Interrater reliability was tested; nine 4 th year occupational therapy students and 15 older persons living in the Chiang Mai community were recruited. The intraclass correlation coefficient of fear of falling of activities done, activities not done and activity restriction scores were. 9845,. 9236 and. 9718 respectively (p < 0. 001). Four raters and 50 older community dwellers participated in the intrarater and test-retest reliability tests. The results showed that intrarater reliability of all raters exceed 0. 8 in every scores (p <. 001). The test-retest also demonstrated good reliability:. 9960,. 9376 and. 9849 (p < 0. 0001) for fear of falling of activities done, activities not done and activity restriction scores respectively. Five hundreds and forty six Thai older adults were then recruited by multistage random sampling. Fall history, fall circumstances, fear of falling and activity restriction data were obtained by structured interview and using the Thai version of the SAFE. The results demonstrated that prevalence of falls, fear of falling and activity restriction in Thai older people were 21 %, 48 % and 18 %, respectively. Comparison between fallers and non-faller showed that fallers were more likely to be older (p <. 001), female [χ 2 (1, N = 546) = 6. 133; p =. 013], not married [χ 2 (4,N= 546) = 61. 102;~=. 001], living alone[χ 2 (l,N= 546) = 4. 313;p=, 041, rated their health as poorer [χ 2 (4, N = 546) = 13. 232; p <. 001], had fear of falling [χ 2 (1, N = 546) = 6. 265; p =. 015] and activity restriction [χ 2 (1, N = 546) = 5. 488; p =, 0271]. Older persons with a fear of falling tended to be older (p =. 005), lower educated (p <. 001), female [χ 2 (1, N = 546) = 29. 602; p =. 001], rated their health as poorer [χ 2 (4, N = 546) = 69. 70; p <. 001], had fallen [? (1, N = 546) = 6. 265; p =, 0151 and had activity restriction [χ 2 (l, N = 546) = 23. 267; p <. 001]. Older adults who curtailed their activities tended to be married [χ 2 (1, N = 546) = 6. 188; p =, 0131, rated their health as poorer [χ 24, N = 546) = 14. 302; p =, 0061, have a fall history [χ 2 (1, N = 546) = 5. 488; p =, 0271 and have a fear of falling [χ 2 (1, N = 546) = 23. 267; p <. 001]. Using Chi-square test, the results showed that there were significant associations between falls and fear of falling χ 2 (l,N= 546) = 6. 265;p=. 015], falls and activity restriction [χ 2 (l,N= 546) = 5. 488; p =, 0271] and fear of falling and activity restriction [χ 2 (1, N = 546) = 23. 267; p <. 001]. Fall circumstances of 114 falls demonstrated that most falls took place outdoors (65 %), were associated with work (40 %), involved environmental hazards (76 %), occurred during the daytime (90 %). Moreover most falls were falls on the same level from slipping, tripping or stumbling (61 %). Logistic regression analysis indicated that risk factors for fear of falling in Thai older people were age (odds ratio = 1. 025), unmarried-female (odds ratio = 5. 979), married female (odds ratio = 1. 903), poor self perceived health (odds ratio = 3. 383) and more than 2 falls experience (odds ratio = 7. 202). The protective factors were unmarried marital status for men (odds ratio = 0. 344) and level of education (odds ratio = 0. 933 2 or less falls and = 0. 5625 if more than 2 falls in 12 months). The logistic model also provided a logistic equation for individual prediction of probability of fear of falling. To calculate the probability of having fear of falling, 6 parameters are required: age, gender, marital status, level of education, self-perceived health and number of falls in the past 12 months. The equation predicts with 70 % accuracy and can be used for screening fear of falling in Thai elderly people. In conclusion, this study has modified a measurement tool (the SAFE Thai version) and developed a screening tool (logistic equation) for fear of falling. Both of them appear to be appropriate to further examine FOF in Thai elderly. The survey results showed a considerably number of Thai elderly people have fall experiences, fear of falling and activity restriction. The predisposing factors for each problem have been identified. The association between 3 problems implicated that fear of falling and activity restriction interventions are necessary for fall prevention. The fall circumstances data show that conditions of falls in Thai elderly people were similar and dissimilar to those in Western countries. The preventive efforts to reduce falls should consider these distinctive fall circumstances...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{problem of}} {{violence}} in healthcare is not new. International literature has demonstrated how certain characteristics of patients, of health professionals, of staff-patient interactions and of work environments {{are associated with the}} occurrence of patient and visitor violence. However, there is minimal research focusing on patient and visitor violence in general hospital settings. The Survey of Violence Experienced by Staff (SOVES), the shortened Perception of Aggression Scale (POAS-S) and the Perception of Importance of Intervention Skills Scale (POIS) are three validated instruments to study multiple dimensions of patient and visitor violence at the clinical level in a variety of general hospital settings. This study aims to psychometrically test the Dutch version of the SOVES, the POAS-S, and the POIS for use in general hospital wards in Flanders. Methods. Translations were conducted by four professionally <b>certified</b> <b>translators.</b> Content validity was evaluated by an expert panel in the field of aggression in the healthcare system. Face validity, feasibility and user-friendliness were appraised by 13 practicing nurses, and the expert panel. Stability was studied in a sample of 81 nursing students with experience in nursing practice. Internal consistency and construct validity of the instruments were assessed in a sample of 238 nurses working in general hospital settings. Internal consistency was tested by calculating Cronbach’s alpha and construct validity was evaluated by exploratory factor analysis and the known groups technique. Results. The SOVES, POAS-S and POIS showed good content validity as evaluated by the expert panel. The face validity was good with no fundamental remarks given. Chi-square tests of the SOVES indicated there were significant relationships between encountering more patient and visitor violence and the amount of patient contact time (X 2 = 3. 941, P = 0. 047), the patients’ ages nurses work with (X 2 = 11. 453, P < 0. 001) and the nurses’ degrees (X 2 = 14. 022, P < 0. 001), which suggests construct validity. The instruments produced similar results during stability testing. Exploratory factor analysis of the POAS-S and the POIS identified the same two-factor structure as described in earlier studies, explaining 46. 7 % and 68. 5 % of the variance respectively. Cronbach’s alpha of the POAS-S was 0. 64 (factor 1) and 0. 70 (factor 2), while the α values of the POIS were 0. 88 (factor 1) and 0. 84 (factor 2). Conclusion. The Dutch version of the Survey of Violence Experienced by Staff (SOVES); the shortened Perception of Aggression Scale (POAS-S) and the Perception of Importance of Intervention Skills Scale (POIS) showed acceptable to good psychometric properties. These instruments are recommended to be used in nursing practice and nursing research to assess patient and visitor violence in general hospitals. status: accepte...|$|R

However, Formosa’s Ministry of Education has not developed key bilingual educational programs or curriculum for the Pilagá. Moreover, only a few schools (six {{of a total of}} sixteen) have Pilagá-speaking aides working together with <b>certified</b> teachers as <b>translators.</b> However, the program is rather ineffective for lack of scope or sequence for Pilagá instruction and few didactic materials. Even though Pilagá use in daily communication between adults connotes solidarity, younger speakers use code-switching apparently to fill gaps in their knowledge of the vernacular language. Those areas where Pilagá language and traditions are best preserved are the rural communities. However, the lack of native-language schooling to Pilagá children makes the future of the language bleak.|$|R

As {{a result of the}} two examination sessions held, 10 sworn interpreters were certified. Since then, and particularly since the abovementioned Oficina discontinued the inclusion of Basque, Catalan and Galician in 1992, the Basque and Navarra autonomous governments have not created their own mechanisms for <b>certifying</b> new sworn <b>translators</b> and interpreters. As most sworn translators and interpreters are functionaries and are not allowed to work outside the purview of their institutional employment, only the Basque government, through its Official Translation Service, offers the possibility of certifying “the accuracy and legal equivalence of translations into Basque and from Basque to Spanish”. In this paper we present the Basque Language Translators Association’s (EIZIE) position and also the type of demand for sworn translation and interpretation in Basque...|$|R
