40|$|Mixed and multi-layered forest {{ecosystems}} are sometimes more productive than monospecific and single-layered ones. It {{has been suggested}} that trees of different species and sizes occupy complementary positions in space which would act as a mechanism to increase <b>canopy</b> <b>light</b> interception and wood production. However, greater <b>canopy</b> <b>light</b> interception reduces the average amount and variability of transmitted radiation offering fewer opportunities for all species to regenerate and to maintain forest heterogeneity in the long-run. We investigated whether increasing overstory heterogeneity indeed results in greater <b>canopy</b> <b>light</b> interception and lower variability in transmittance. We modeled the three-dimensional structure of forest stands with 3 typical forest structures, 10 mixtures of four tree species, and 3 different basal areas. We used the forest light interception model SAMSARALIGHT and performed three-way analyses of covariance to analyze the effects of the three varied components of forest heterogeneity. We found no evidence that increasing heterogeneity increases <b>canopy</b> <b>light</b> interception. In contrast, homogeneous stands intercept more light than heterogeneous stands. Variability in transmittance increased in some cases with compositional heterogeneity and, to a lesser extent, with tree size inequalities.

Different approaches {{have been used}} to measure <b>canopy</b> <b>light</b> interception in the field. The use of a manually operated light-bar or multiple light-bars mounted on stationary devices and connected to a datalogger is costly and relatively inflexible. Difficulties with these approaches have led us to develop a portable prototype system for multi-strata measurement of light interception. The ability of the devices to take accurate simultaneous multi-strata <b>canopy</b> <b>light</b> interception measurements was tested on field-grown corn plants produced under a range of N fertilization levels with: (1) hybrids exhibiting a wide range of canopy architectures, and (2) different planting patterns. The device allowed accurate and instantaneous measurement of crop <b>canopy</b> <b>light</b> interception at various depths, allowing calculation of percent light transmitted at various canopy strata. The prototype system could hold up to six 1 -m long light-bars, thus simultaneously collecting data at six canopy levels.

40|$|Light is an {{important}} factor governing seedling establishment and tree growth in tropical forests. A series of hemispherical lens canopy pictures were taken in a long-term, permanent tree plot at Cocha Cashu Biological Station, Manu National Park, Madre de Dios, Peru in 2003 and 2008.

The resulting light data was then correlated with tree sapling data from the same plot, to determine the relationship between <b>canopy</b> <b>light</b> and sapling growth at the site. Extensive analysis of the canopy pictures and calculated light values revealed two important findings. The first is that grouped series of hemispherical photographs yield data that is internally consistent, and whose values correctly characterizing light conditions within a given study location. The second finding is that hemispherical pictures are weakly autocorrelated, making any attempt to spatially or temporally correlate individual sets of light values difficult.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of irradiating the abaxial leaf side compared to irradiating the adaxial side, in rose plants grown in glasshouse with the bending technique. The instantaneous effects on the optical properties and the light response of photosynthesis were analysed in intact leaves. Results demonstrated that the rate of net photosynthesis was higher when leaves were lighted from the adaxial side compared to the abaxial side. This was the consequence of both a higher light absorption and higher quantum yield (photosynthesis per unit absorbed light) in adaxial-lighted leaves...|$|E

Our {{goal is to}} minimize capture overhead; thus the only input required {{is a set of}} photographs of the tree taken at a single time of day, while allowing relighting at any other time. We first analyze lighting in a tree canopy both theoretically and using simulations. From this analysis, we observe that tree <b>canopy</b> <b>lighting</b> is similar to volumetric illumination. We assume a single-scattering volumetric lighting model for tree canopies, and diffuse leaf reflectance; we validate our assumptions with synthetic renderings. We create a volumetric representation of the tree from 10 - 12 images taken at a single time of day and and use a single-scattering participating media lighting model. An analytical sun and sky illumination model provides consistent representation of lighting for the captured input and unknown target times. We relight the input image by applying a ratio of the target and input time lighting representations. We compute this representation efficiently by simultaneously coding transmittance from the sky and to the eye in spherical harmonics. We validate our method by relighting images of synthetic trees and comparing to path-traced solutions.

40|$|Phytochromes phyB and phyA mediate a {{remarkable}} developmental switch whereby, early upon seed imbibition, <b>canopy</b> <b>light</b> prevents phyB-dependent germination, whereas later on, it stimulates phyA-dependent germination. Using a seed coat bedding assay where {{the growth of}} dissected embryos is monitored {{under the influence of}} dissected endosperm, allowing combinatorial use of mutant embryos and endosperm, we show that <b>canopy</b> <b>light</b> specifically inactivates phyB activity in the endosperm to override phyA-dependent signaling in the embryo. This interference involves abscisic acid (ABA) release from the endosperm and distinct spatial activities of phytochrome signaling components. Under the canopy, endospermic ABA opposes phyA signaling through the transcription factor (TF) ABI 5, which shares with the TF PIF 1 several target genes that negatively regulate germination in the embryo. ABI 5 enhances the expression of phytochrome signaling genes PIF 1, SOMNUS, GAI, and RGA, but also of ABA and gibberellic acid (GA) metabolic genes. Over time, weaker ABA-dependent responses eventually enable phyA-dependent germination, a distinct type of germination driven solely by embryonic growth...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the last}} few years, a new {{tendency}} has been created towards robotic harvesting of oranges and some of citrus fruits. The first step in robotic harvesting is accurate recognition and positioning of fruits. Detection through image processing by color cameras and computer is currently the most common method. Obviously, a harvesting robot faces with natural conditions and, therefore, detection must be done in various light conditions and environments. In this study, it was attempted to provide a suitable algorithm for recognizing the orange fruits on tree. In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm, 500 images were taken in different conditions of <b>canopy,</b> <b>lighting</b> and {{the distance to the}} tree.

As there exist a high percentage of the clustered oranges in images, any algorithm aiming to detect oranges on the trees successfully should offer a solution to separate these oranges first.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{an evaluation of}} gas station <b>canopy</b> <b>lighting</b> using 3 types of luminaires: drop-lens, non-cutoff luminaires, in which the lamp is visible from far away; flat-lens, full-cutoff luminaires; and drop-lens, cutoff luminaires, in which the lamp is not visible from far away. The evaluations considered photometric conditions, energy efficiency, the tendency of drivers to turn into the station, patron opinions, the opinions of a panel of community leaders, and gasoline sales. The evaluation was carried out between April 12 and May 11, 2001. All three installations had the same power density and, thus, energy consumption. The installation using the drop-lens, non-cutoff luminaires produced lower illuminances under the canopy but greater glare and more light trespass than the full-cutoff and cutoff luminaires. These findings were predictable from the luminous intensity distributions of the luminaires. The percentage of drivers turning in to the station and {{the mean number of}} gallons of gasoline sold daily increased immediately following the change of lighting from the drop-lens, non-cutoff luminaires to the flat-lens, full-cutoff luminaires, and again when the latter were changed to the drop-lens, cutoff luminaires. These changes in drivers ’ behavior suggest that better lighting encourages drivers to use a gas station, but a more comprehensive study should be conducted to validate these findings. As for opinions, the patrons saw little difference between the three lighting installations. However, the panel, which compared several gas stations, gave the highest level of acceptance for the drop-lens, cutoff lighting and the lowest (at a different gas station) for the drop-lens, non-cutoff luminaire. ...|$|E

However, crop models describing the dynamic changes in canopy structure with environmental conditions and the complex interactions between <b>canopy</b> structure, <b>light</b> interception, and dry mass production are only gradually emerging. Using tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) as a model crop, a dynamic functional-structural plant model (FSPM) was constructed, parameterized, and evaluated to analyse the effects of temperature on architectural traits, which strongly influence <b>canopy</b> <b>light</b> interception and shoot dry mass. The FSPM predicted the organ growth, organ size, and shoot dry mass over time with high accuracy (> 85 %). Analyses of this FSPM showed that, {{in comparison with the}} reference canopy, shoot dry mass may be affected by leaf angle by as much as 20 %, leaf curvature by up to 7 %, the leaf length: width ratio by up to 5 %, internode length by up to 9 %, and curvature ratios and leaf arrangement by up to 6 %. Tomato canopies at low temperature had higher canopy density and were more clumped due to higher leaf area and shorter internodes. Interestingly, dry mass production and light interception of the clumped canopy were more sensitive to changes in architectural traits. The complex interactions between architectural traits, <b>canopy</b> <b>light</b> interception, dry mass production, and environmental conditions can be studied by the dynamic FSPM, which may serve as a tool for designing a canopy structure which is 'ideal' in a given environment.

An understanding of the association between environmental factors and the prevalence of wasting disease in seagrass meadows is important for elucidating plant-pathogen interactions in coastal environments. We conducted a survey of 7 turtle grass-dominated beds within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary to assess the relationship between environmental and biological parameters on seagrass health. All sites contained Labyrinthula spp.; the most pathogenic strain was obtained from an anthropogenically impacted site. Leaf and total biomass, in addition to root/rhizome carbon content, <b>canopy</b> <b>light</b> and % light transmitted, all displayed strong negative correlations with a wasting index (WI).

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State UniversityInterception of photosynthetically active {{radiation}} (PAR) {{is fundamental}} to tree fruit canopy growth, fruit yield, and quality. Many studies have investigated PAR in traditional hedgerow orchard orchards but there are few reports from modern planar canopy architectures. This research aimed to develop a system capable of large-scale measurement of PAR interception and evaluate light relations in modern planar orchard systems. A mobile measurement system capable of continuously collecting high-density PAR data was developed. This system could maintain a constant spatial resolution 0. 01 × 0. 10 m/sample (traveling direction × perpendicular to traveling direction) between 0 - 3. 8 km/h. A graphic data acquisition interface was created for real-time monitoring data acquisition process. The mobile measurement system was utilized to develop a canopy mapping method and a light interception conversion method for obtaining the same measure basis. The canopy mapping method was designed to visualize the canopy shadow as though the sun were directly overhead (i. e., correcting distortion caused by the azimuth and zenith angles). This method was validated in a Y-trellis sweet cherry orchard at dormant and full canopy stages with average relative error of 3. 4 %± 3. 1 % and 4. 8 %± 2. 6 % respectively. An additional study determined {{the best time to}} take single measurement representative of daily canopy PAR interception based on diurnal and seasonal data. The optimum measurement time to represent diurnal PAR interception in a vertical fruiting wall architecture of sweet cherry was from 09 : 30 h to 10 : 30 h (daylight saving time) with ± 10 % tolerance interval of daily <b>light</b> interception. <b>Canopy</b> <b>light</b> interception varies according to measurement time and/or location, resulting different measure basis.
