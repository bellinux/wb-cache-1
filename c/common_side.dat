5|$|Fingolimod {{may give}} rise to {{hypertension}} and slowed heart rate, macular edema, elevated liver enzymes or a reduction in lymphocyte levels. Tentative evidence supports the short-term safety of teriflunomide, with <b>common</b> <b>side</b> effects including: headaches, fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and limb pain. There have also been reports of liver failure and PML with its use and it is dangerous for fetal development. Most <b>common</b> <b>side</b> effects of dimethyl fumarate are flushing and gastrointestinal problems. While dimethyl fumarate {{may lead to a}} reduction in the white blood cell count there were no reported cases of opportunistic infections during trials.|$|E
5|$|In {{adolescent}} and adults, <b>common</b> <b>side</b> effects reported include weight loss, constipation, dyslipidemia and, in women, dysmenorrhea.|$|E
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>side</b> {{effect is}} bleeding. Less <b>common</b> <b>side</b> effects may include areas of tissue damage and purple toes syndrome. Use is not {{generally}} recommended during pregnancy. It {{is recommended that}} the effects of warfarin typically be monitored by checking prothrombin time (INR) every one to four weeks. Many other medications and dietary factors can interact with warfarin, either increasing or decreasing its effectiveness. The effects of warfarin may be reversed with phytonadione (vitamin K1), fresh frozen plasma, or prothrombin complex concentrate.|$|E

50|$|Sir Francis Verney (1584 - 6 September 1615) was an English adventurer, {{soldier of}} fortune, and pirate. A nobleman by birth, he left England after the House of <b>Commons</b> <b>sided</b> with his {{stepmother}} {{in a legal}} dispute over his inheritance, and became a mercenary in Morocco and later a Barbary corsair.|$|R
50|$|<b>Common</b> (>1%) <b>side</b> effects include insulin resistance, {{hyperglycemia}} and lipodystrophy.|$|R
5|$|<b>Common</b> <b>side</b> effects include nausea, diarrhea, rash, {{and pain}} {{at the site}} of injection. It {{increases}} the risk of hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile colitis about fourfold. Other antibiotics may be recommended instead due to this reason. It appears to be generally safe in pregnancy. It is of the lincosamide class and works by blocking bacteria from making protein.|$|E
5|$|The Pythagorean tiling is {{the unique}} tiling by squares of two {{different}} sizes that is both unilateral (no two squares have a <b>common</b> <b>side)</b> and equitransitive (each two squares {{of the same size}} can be mapped into each other by a symmetry of the tiling).|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{side-effects}} of benzodiazepines {{are related to}} their sedating and muscle-relaxing action. They include drowsiness, dizziness, and decreased alertness and concentration. Lack of coordination may result in falls and injuries, in particular, in the elderly. Another result is impairment of driving skills and increased likelihood of road traffic accidents. Decreased libido and erection problems are a <b>common</b> <b>side</b> effect. Depression and disinhibition may emerge. Hypotension and suppressed breathing (hypoventilation) may be encountered with intravenous use. Less <b>common</b> <b>side</b> effects include nausea and changes in appetite, blurred vision, confusion, euphoria, depersonalization and nightmares. Cases of liver toxicity have been described but are very rare.|$|E

5|$|BZP also {{acts as a}} non-selective {{serotonin}} {{receptor agonist}} {{on a wide variety}} of serotonin receptors; binding to 5HT2A receptors may explain its mild hallucinogenic effects at high doses, while partial agonist or antagonist effects at the 5HT2B receptors may explain some of BZPs peripheral side effects, as this receptor is expressed very densely in the gut, and binding to 5HT3 receptors may explain the <b>common</b> <b>side</b> effect of headaches, as this receptor is known to be involved in the development of migraine headaches.|$|E
5|$|<b>Common</b> <b>side</b> effects {{include an}} upset stomach. More {{significant}} side effects include stomach ulcers, stomach bleeding, and worsening asthma. Bleeding risk is greater {{among those who}} are older, drink alcohol, take other NSAIDs, or are on blood thinners. Aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy. It is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of Reye's syndrome. High doses may result in ringing in the ears.|$|E
5|$|<b>Common</b> <b>side</b> effects include hair loss, {{bone marrow}} suppression, vomiting, rash, and {{inflammation}} of the mouth. Other serious side effects may include allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis, heart damage, tissue damage {{at the site of}} injection, radiation recall, and treatment-related leukemia. People often experience red discoloration of the urine for a few days. Doxorubicin is in the anthracycline and antitumor antibiotic family of medications. It works in part by interfering with the function of DNA.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the biggest}} issues with home siding is its {{propensity}} for rotting and warping at the seams. Majic manufactures and installs seamless siding to prevent these <b>common</b> <b>siding</b> issues. Majic is the exclusive provider of vinyl seamless siding in Southeast Michigan. With a classic wood-like appearance, Majic seamless siding is accepted in certain historical districts where traditional vinyl siding is not.|$|R
50|$|The siding {{accommodation}} at Hendford {{was very}} cramped, and to facilitate goods exchange traffic, the GWR built a short goods branch line to Yeovil Junction from the Weymouth line; it was officially {{referred to as}} the Clifton Maybank Siding, and it opened on 13 June 1864. It was broad gauge and there was no <b>common</b> <b>siding</b> accommodation; the exchange was by transhipping the goods.|$|R
50|$|The most <b>common</b> adverse <b>side</b> effects include redness, skin {{discoloration}} and pain. Other {{side effects}} include blistering and scarring.|$|R
5|$|Known as {{the castle}} by inmates, the prison had a turreted lodge at the entrance, {{with a side}} room called the pound, where new prisoners would wait until a room was found for them. The front lodge led to a {{courtyard}} known as the park. This had been divided in two by a long narrow wall, so that prisoners from the <b>common</b> <b>side</b> could not be seen by those on the master's side, who preferred not to be distressed {{by the sight of}} abject poverty, especially when they might themselves be plunged into it at any moment.|$|E
5|$|The euro {{is divided}} into 100 cents (sometimes {{referred}} to as euro cents, especially when distinguishing them from other currencies, and referred to as such on the <b>common</b> <b>side</b> of all cent coins). In Community legislative acts the plural forms of euro and cent are spelled without the s, notwithstanding normal English usage. Otherwise, normal English plurals are sometimes used, with many local variations such as centime in France.|$|E
5|$|The only <b>common</b> <b>side</b> {{effect of}} {{warfarin}} is bleeding. The risk of severe bleeding is small but definite (a typically yearly rate of 1-3% has been reported) and any benefit needs to outweigh this risk when warfarin is considered. All types of bleeding occur more commonly, {{but the most}} severe ones are those involving the brain (intracerebral hemorrhage/hemorrhagic stroke) and the spinal cord. Risk of bleeding is increased if the INR is out of range (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions). This risk increases greatly once the INR exceeds 4.5.|$|E
50|$|Due to its world, its {{diversity}} of industrial {{resources and the}} cultural {{diversity of}} the Venezuelan people, Venezuelan cuisine often varies greatly from one region to another. Its cuisine, traditional as well as modern, is influenced by its European (Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French), West African and Native American traditions. Food staples include corn, rice, plantain, yams, beans and several meats. Potatoes, tomatoes, onions, eggplants, squashes, spinach and zucchini are also <b>common</b> <b>sides</b> in the Venezuelan diet.|$|R
50|$|As a {{tetracycline}} derivative, tigecycline exhibits similar {{side effects}} {{to the class}} of antibiotics. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are the most <b>common</b> reported <b>side</b> effect.|$|R
5000|$|Macaroni and {{tomatoes}} — Macaroni {{and tomatoes}} is a <b>common</b> mountain-region <b>side</b> dish. Although {{there are many}} variations, the dish typically consists of cooked macaroni and canned tomatoes.|$|R
5|$|There was a bar {{run by the}} governor's wife, and a chandler's shop run in 1728 by a Mr and Mrs Cary, both prisoners, {{which sold}} candles, soap and a little food. There was a coffee shop run in 1729 by a {{long-term}} prisoner, Sarah Bradshaw, and a steak house called Titty Doll's run by another prisoner, Richard McDonnell, and his wife. There was also a tailor and a barber, and prisoners from the master's side could hire prisoners from the <b>common</b> <b>side</b> to act as their servants.|$|E
5|$|When {{given for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe antibiotic. It {{can be used in}} people of all ages and in people with liver disease or poor kidney function. <b>Common</b> <b>side</b> effects with short-term use include headache, diarrhea, rash, and nausea. Serious side effects may include serotonin syndrome, bone marrow suppression, and high blood lactate levels, particularly when used for more than two weeks. If used for longer periods still, it may cause sometimes irreversible nerve damage including optic nerve damage.|$|E
5|$|Patients {{and their}} guardians must be apprised of any serious risks and the <b>common</b> <b>side</b> effects of pain treatments. What {{appears to be}} an {{obviously}} acceptable risk or harm to a professional may be unacceptable to the person who has to undertake that risk or experience the side effect. For instance, people who experience pain on movement may be willing to forgo strong opioids in order to enjoy alertness during their painless periods, whereas others would choose around-the-clock sedation so as to remain pain-free. The care provider should not insist on treatment that someone rejects, and must not provide treatment that the provider believes is more harmful or riskier than the possible benefits can justify.|$|E
50|$|Medications and herbal {{supplements}} {{that affect}} body temperature and blood flow may cause piloerection. For example, {{one of the}} <b>common</b> reported <b>side</b> effects of the intake of Yohimbine HCL is piloerection.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, a {{restaurant}} that specializes in beefsteaks {{is known as a}} steakhouse, and typical steak dinner consists of a steak, optionally topped with sautéed onions and mushrooms, with a starchy side dish; usually baked or mashed potatoes, or thick cut french fries known as steak fries. Chili, rice, pasta, or beans are also <b>common</b> <b>sides.</b> A side salad or a small serving of cooked vegetables often accompanies the meat and side, with corn on the cob, green beans, creamed spinach, asparagus, tomatoes, mushrooms, peas, and onion rings being popular. A well-known accompaniment to steak is shrimp or a cooked lobster tail, a combination often called [...] "surf and turf" [...] or [...] "reef and beef" [...] and [...] "pier and steer". Rounding out an American steak dinner is some sort of bread, usually a dinner roll.|$|R

5|$|The few {{contraindications}} {{to surgery}} include inoperable tumor, massive obesity, a particularly high-risk operation, or {{a desire to}} preserve fertility. These contraindications happen in about 5–10% of cases. Women who wish to preserve their fertility and have low-grade stage I cancer can be treated with progestins, with or without concurrent tamoxifen therapy. This therapy can be continued until the cancer does not respond to treatment or until childbearing is done. Uterine perforation may occur during a D or an endometrial biopsy. Side effects of surgery to remove endometrial cancer can specifically include sexual dysfunction, temporary incontinence, and lymphedema, along with more <b>common</b> <b>side</b> effects of any surgery, including constipation.|$|E
5|$|When {{used for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe drug. <b>Common</b> <b>side</b> effects of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%). Fungal infections such as thrush and vaginal candidiasis may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called antibiotic candidiasis). Less common (and potentially more serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, and elevated transaminases, which {{may be a sign}} of liver damage. Unlike some antibiotics, such as erythromycin and the quinolones, linezolid has no effect on the QT interval, a measure of cardiac electrical conduction. Adverse effects in children are similar to those that occur in adults.|$|E
5|$|Reduction in the {{activity}} of the cholinergic neurons is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce the rate at which acetylcholine (ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of cholinergic neurons. There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage. Only donepezil is approved for treatment of advanced AD dementia. The use of these drugs in mild cognitive impairment has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of AD. The most <b>common</b> <b>side</b> effects are nausea and vomiting, both of which are linked to cholinergic excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10–20% of users, are mild to moderate in severity, and can be managed by slowly adjusting medication doses. Less common secondary effects include muscle cramps, decreased heart rate (bradycardia), decreased appetite and weight, and increased gastric acid production.|$|E
50|$|Very <b>common</b> (>10% frequency) <b>side</b> effects include headache, high heart rate, and palpitations.|$|R
50|$|In 1939 a new factory for the Morris Motors Pressing Branch was {{constructed}} on the <b>Common</b> Lane <b>side</b> of the Ward End Works. This was renamed Nuffield Metal Products in 1945. Production of Wolseley cars recommenced on September 4, 1945.|$|R
25|$|When {{the station}} was built, much of Battersea {{was the site of}} heavy {{industry}} while Clapham, a mile south-east of this point, was fashionable. The railway companies, to attract a middle- and upper-class clientele, seized the unindustrial parish calculating that being upon the slopes of Clapham's plateau would only re-inforce this distinction, leading to a long-lasting misunderstanding that the station is in Clapham. The railway companies were not alone in eschewing the name of Battersea; from the 1880s until the 1950s the imposing private houses forming the streets of the district were commonly recorded by property-owning residents as 'Clapham <b>Common</b> N. <b>Side,</b> London' and 'Clapham <b>Common</b> W. <b>Side,</b> London' despite being well away from those park-side streets.|$|R
