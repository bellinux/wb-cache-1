40|$|Initial tests {{results are}} {{presented}} for the novel process of hydrogen production called unmixed steam reforming (USR) using methane and sunflower oil fuels. The USR process relies on two mass transfer materials which operate on a two-step cycle: an oxygen transfer material (OTM) which provides the heat necessary for the steam reforming reaction, and a CO 2 sorbent which shifts the water gas reaction yielding a H 2 -rich reformate gas. A shortlist of Ni-based OTMs and a natural dolomite were tested during bench-scale investigation and optimisation stages following micro-reactor tests. Under near-isothermal conditions, we show the sequence via which the main reactions occurred. We unexpectedly found that thermal decomposition of the fuel {{played a significant role}} in the early H 2 production concurrent with coking conditions, by causing the OTM to initially reduce. The direct OTM reduction from the fuel via the unmixed combustion reaction then took over to a point where the steam reforming reaction could begin. Most importantly, <b>carbon</b> <b>lay-down</b> (coking) during the fuel/steam flow did not lower gradually the process efficiency, as it was shown to completely oxidise under the cyclic feeds of air and fuel/steam flows of the USR process. Both methane and sunflower oil were shown to be suitable fuels for the USR process...|$|E
40|$|C 2 to C 4 olefins are {{traditionally}} produced from steam cracking of naphtha. The necessity for alternative production routes for these major commodity chemicals via non-oil-based processes has driven research in past {{times during the}} oil crises. Currently, there is {{a renewed interest in}} producing lower olefins from alternative feedstocks such as coal, natural gas, or biomass, in view of high oil prices, environmental regulations, and strategies to gain independence from oil imports. This review describes the major routes for the production of lower olefins from synthesis gas with an emphasis on a direct or single step process, the so-called FTO or Fischerâˆ’Tropsch to olefins process. The different catalysts for FTO are outlined and compared, and the key issues and requirements for future developments are highlighted. Iron-based catalysts are prevailing for FTO, and reproducible lower olefin selectivities of 50 wt % of hydrocarbons produced have been realized at CO conversions higher than 70 % for 60 to 1000 h on stream. Remarkably the high selectivity to lower olefins has been achieved over a broad range of process conditions (P, T, H 2 /CO ratio, GHSV). A major challenge for further development and application of FTO catalysts is the suppression of <b>carbon</b> <b>lay-down</b> to enhance catalyst lifetime and to preserve their physical integrity under demanding reaction conditions...|$|E
