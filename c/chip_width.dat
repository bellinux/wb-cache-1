The computer simulations show that the method can not only fit the need of the low signal to noise ratio which is quite common in the detection of DSSS signals, but also can give the estimations of the symbol period and <b>chip</b> <b>width</b> in a simple way. Especially, the proposed method can give an exact estimation of the symbol period by increasing the processed sampling data when the sampling rate is fixed, which is very important for the detection of DSSS signals...|$|E

40|$|American Society of Mechanical EngineersThe {{measurement}} of cutting force systems {{is one of}} the most frequently used techniques for the monitoring of machining processes. Its wide spread application ranges from tool condition identification, feedback control, cutting system design, to process optimization. To gain fundamental understanding of the force system in machining, this paper presents the work of establishing a closed form expression for the cutting force in end milling as an explicit function of cutting parameters and tool/workpiece geometry. Based on the theoretical local cutting force model, the generation of total cutting forces is formulated as the angular convolution of three uncorrelated cutting process component functions, namely the elemental cutting force function, the <b>chip</b> <b>width</b> density function, and the tooth sequence function. The elemental cutting force function is related to the chip formation process in an elemental cutting area and it is characterized by the chip thickness variation, specific cutting pressure constants, and entry/exit angles. The <b>chip</b> <b>width</b> density function defines the <b>chip</b> <b>width</b> per unit cutter rotation along a cutter flute within the range of axial depth of cut as the function of the angular position of each cutting point. The tooth sequence function represents the spacing between flutes as well as their cutting sequence as the cutter rotates. The analysis of cutting forces is extended into the Fourier domain by taking the frequency multiplication of the transforms of the three component functions. Fourier series coefficients of the cutting forces are shown to be algebraic functions of various tool parameters and cutting conditions. Simulation results are presented in the frequency domain to illustrate the effects of process parameters. A series of end milling experiments are performed and their results discussed to validate the analytical model...|$|E

An experimental procedure is developed to highlight the impact of cutting speed and feed rate on the cutting process when machining the 18 MND 5 steel. Parameters based on dimensional characteristics of chips are introduced to quantify the morphology of chips generated by central, intermediate and external inserts of the complex BTA drilling tool. From observation of the chips morphology (flat, curved and spiral) and the measurement of the <b>chips</b> <b>width,</b> the provenance of each chip with respect to cutting inserts is identified.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} property-process {{correlations}} in simulated clinical abrasive adjusting {{of a wide}} range of dental restorative ceramics using a dental handpiece and diamond burs. The seven materials studied included four mica-containing glass ceramics, a feldspathic porcelain, a glass-infiltrated alumina, and a yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia. The abrasive adjusting process was conducted under simulated clinical conditions using diamond burs and a clinical dental handpiece. An attempt was made to establish correlations between process characteristics in terms of removal rate, chipping damage, and surface finish and material mechanical properties of hardness, fracture toughness and Young's modulus. The results show that the removal rate is mainly a function of hardness, which decreases nonlinearly with hardness. No correlations were noted between the removal rates and the complex relations of hardness, Young's modulus and fracture toughness. Surface roughness was primarily a linear function of diamond grit size and was relatively independent of materials. Chipping damage in terms of the average <b>chipping</b> <b>width</b> decreased with fracture toughness except for glass-infiltrated alumina. It also had higher linear correlations with critical stain energy release rates (R²= 0. 66) and brittleness (R²= 0. 62) and a lower linear correlation with indices of brittleness (R²= 0. 32). Implications of these results can provide guidance for the microstructural design of dental ceramics, optimize performance, and guide the proper selection of technical parameters in clinical abrasive adjusting conducted by dental practitioners...|$|R

In most machine shops, the profit margin is typically quite low. Optimized processing is required to ensure a profit. Simulation of metal-cutting processes provides substantial opportunities for enhancing throughput, decreasing costs and improving product quality. The use of computer simulations to avoid unstable cutting processes is one area where significant gains can be realized. Time domain simulation models were developed for both plunge feed turning and slender endmilling. Simulations were conducted using C++ computer programs. Chatter (i. e., excessive tool vibration) is shown to exist beyond a stability limit of <b>chip</b> <b>width</b> for both cases. Sinusoidal varying tool displacements are demonstrated to contribute to regenerative surface waviness (i. e., causing varying chip thickness) for all chip widths. A nominal tool displacement that is proportional to <b>chip</b> <b>width</b> arises due to the tool compliance and force exerted on the tool. When chip widths are below a limiting size for stability, displacement amplitudes decay towards the nominal tool displacement value. For chip widths at the stability limit, a constant amplitude of the tool displacement around the nominal value occurs. A constant growth of the displacement amplitude occurs for chip widths above the stability limit. Generally, the growth rate in the amplitude is fester for larger amounts of excessive chip widths. However, the amplitude growth is limited when the tool momentarily and repeatedly leaves the cut corresponding to chatter. Experimental verification was performed utilizing a Kistler force dynamometer, a Tektronix data acquisition system, a Renault lathe and a Mori-Seiki machining center.

40|$|We {{consider}} here a {{model from}} [1] for regenerative chatter in a drilling process. The {{model is a}} nonlinear delay differential equation where the delay arises {{from the fact that}} the cutting tool passes over the metal surface repeatedly. For any fixed value of the delay, a large enough increase in the width of the chip being cut results in a Hopf bifurcation from the steady state, which is the origin of the chatter vibration. We show that for zero delay the Hopf bifurcation is degenerate and that for small delay this leads to a canard explosion. That is, as the <b>chip</b> <b>width</b> is increased beyond the Hopf bifurcation value, there is a rapid transition from a small amplitude limit cycle to a large relaxation cycle.

Additionally, bond wires to the grounded coplanar waveguide pads at the RF input and output of the internal amplifier are added to ensure good ground connections to the waveguide package. The S-parameters of the module, not corrected for input or output waveguide loss, are measured at the waveguide flange edges. The amplifier module has over 10 dB of gain from 290 to 330 GHz, with a peak gain of over 14 dB at 307 GHz. The WR 2. 2 waveguide cutoff is again observed at 268 GHz.

The study was further expanded to microchannel surfaces. The optimal electrodeposition parameters were employed to selectively coat the fin tops of open microchannel structures. Effects of geometrical parameters of the microchannels were investigated on pool boiling performance at atmospheric pressure. A maximum value of critical heat flux of 3, 250 kW/m 2 was obtained for <b>Chip</b> 9 (fin <b>width</b> = 200 μm, channel width = 500 μm and channel depth = 400 μm) at a wall superheat of 7. 3 °C.

High speed images of the boiling process were obtained and the bubble dynamics and heat transfer mechanism were studied. The bubble growth and heat transfer processes are altered when the boiling takes place preferentially on the fin tops only.

Examples are modeling of active and passive devices and their low performance, highly attenuated channel and poor signal to noise ratio in the mmW. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate and develop new technologies enabling cost-effective implementation of mmW and sub-mmW imaging systems. To achieve this goal, an integrated active Rotman lens architecture is proposed as an ultimate solution to combine the unique properties of a Rotman lens with the superiority of CMOS technology for fabrication of cost effective integrated mmW systems. However, due to the limited sensitivity of on-chip detectors in the mmW, a large number of high gain, wide-band and miniaturized mmW Low Noise Amplifiers (LNA) are required to implement the proposed integrated Rotman lens architecture. A unique solution presented in this thesis is the novel Band Pass Distributed Amplifier (BPDA) topology. In this new topology, by short circuiting the line terminations in a Conventional Distributed Amplifier (CDA), standing waves are created in its artificial transmission lines. Conventionally, standing waves are strongly avoided by carefully matching these lines to 50 Ω in order to prevent instability of the amplifier. This causes that {{a large portion of the}} signal be absorbed in these resistive terminations. In this thesis, it is shown that due to presence of highly lossy parasitics of CMOS transistor at the mmW the amplifier stability is inherently achieved. Moreover, by eliminating these lossy and noise terminations in the CDA, the amplifier gain is boosted and its noise figure is reduced. In addition, a considerable decrease in the number of elements enables low power realization of many amplifiers in a small chip area. Using the lumped element model of the transistor, the transfer function of a single stage BPDAs is derived and compared to its conventional counter part. A methodology to design a single stage BPDA to achieve all the design goals is presented. Using the presented design guidelines, amplifiers for different mmW frequencies have been designed, fabricated and tested. Using only 4 transistors, a 60 GHz amplifier is fabricated on a very small chip area of 0. 105 mm 2 by a low-cost 130 nm CMOS technology. A peak gain of 14. 7 dB and a noise figure of 6 dB are measured for this fabricated amplifier. oreover, it is shown that by further circuit optimization, high gain amplification can be realized at frequencies above the cut-off frequency of the transistor. Simulations show 32 and 28 dB gain can be obtained by implementing only 6 transistors using this CMOS technology at 60 and 77 GHz. A 4 -stage 85 GHz amplifier is also designed and fabricated and a measured gain of 10 dB at 82 GHz is achieved with a 3 dB bandwidth of 11 GHz from 80 to 91 GHz. A good agreement between the simulated and measured results verifies the accuracy of the design procedure. In addition, a multi-stage wide-band BPDA has been designed to show the ability of the proposed topology for design of wide band mmW amplifiers using the CMOS technology. Simulated gain of 20. 5 dB with a considerable 3 dB bandwidth of 38 GHz from 30 to 68 GHz is achieved while the noise figure is less than 6 dB in the whole bandwidth. An amplifier figure of merit is defined in terms of gain, noise figure, <b>chip</b> area, band <b>width</b> and power consumption. The results are compared to those of the state of the art to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed circuit topology and presented design techniques. Finally, a Rotman lens is designed and optimized by choosing a very small Focal Lens Ratio (FL), and a high measured efficiency of greater than 30 % is achieved while the lens dimensions are less than 6 mm. The lens is designed and implemented using a low cost Alumina substrate and conventional microstrip lines to ease its integration with the active parts of the system. 1 yea...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the effects of channel surface wettability and temperature gradients on the boiling flow pattern in a single microchannel. The test section consists of a bottom silicon substrate bonded with a top glass cover. Three consecutive parts of an inlet fluid plenum, a central microchannel and an outlet fluid plenum were etched in the silicon substrate. The central microchannel had a width of 800 mu m and a depth of 30 mu m. Acetone liquid was used as the working fluid. High outlet vapor qualities were dealt with here. The flow pattern consists of a fluid triangle (shrinkage of the liquid films) and a connected long liquid rivulet, which is generated in the central microchannel in the timescale of milliseconds. The peculiar flow pattern is formed due to the following reasons: (1) the liquid rivulet tends to have a large contact area with the top hydrophilic channel surface of the glass cover, but a smaller contact area with the bottom silicon hydrophobic surface. (2) The temperature gradient in the <b>chip</b> <b>width</b> direction at the top channel surface of the glass cover not only causes the shrinkage of the liquid films in the central microchannel upstream, but also attracts the liquid rivulet populated near the microchannel centerline. (3) The zigzag pattern is formed due to the competition between the evaporation momentum forces at the vapor-liquid interfaces and the force due to the Marangoni effect. The former causes the rivulet to deviate from the channel centerline and the latter draws the rivulet toward the channel centerline. (4) The temperature gradient along the flow direction in the central microchannel downstream causes the breakup of the rivulet to form isolated droplets there. (5) Liquid stripes inside the upstream fluid triangle were caused by the small capillary number of the liquid film, at which the large surface tension force relative to the viscous force tends to populate the liquid film locally on the top glass cover surface.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to develop {{techniques}} for manufacturing anatomically-shaped substrates of implants made from calcium polyphosphate (CPP) ceramic. These substrates have tissue-engineered cartilage growing on their top surfaces and can be used as implants for osteochondral focal defect repair. While many research groups have been fabricating such substrates using standard material shapes, e. g., rectangles and circular discs, it is considered beneficial to develop methods that can be integrated in the substrate fabrication process to produce an implant that is specific to a patient’s own anatomy (as obtained from computer tomography data) to avoid uneven and/or elevated stress distribution that can affect the survival of cartilage. The custom-made, porous CPP substrates were fabricated with three-dimensional printing (3 DP) and computer numerically controlled (CNC) machining for the first time to the best of the author’s knowledge. The 3 DP technique was employed in two routines: indirect- and direct- 3 DP. In the former, 3 DP was used to fabricate molds for pre-shaping of the CPP substrates from two different powder size ranges (< 75 μm and 106 - 150 μm). In the latter, CPP substrates were produced directly from the retrofitted 3 DP apparatus in a layer-by-layer fashion from 45 - 75 μm CPP powder with a polymeric binder. The prototyped samples were then sintered to obtain the required porosity and mechanical properties. These substrates were characterized in terms of their dimensional shrinkage and density. Also, SEM images were used to assess the particle distribution and neck and bond formations. The substrates produced using the indirect- 3 DP method yielded densities (< 75 μm: 66. 28 ± 11. 62 % and 106 - 150 μm: 65. 87 ± 6. 12 %), which were comparable to the substrates used currently and with some success in animal studies. Geometric adjustment factors were devised to compensate for the slight expansion inherent in the 3 DP mold fabricating process. These equations were used to bring the plaster molds into true dimension. The direct- 3 DP method has proven to be the ultimate choice due to its ability to produce complex anatomically-shaped substrates without the use of a chemical solvent. In addition, it allows for precise control of both pore size and internal architectures of the substrates. Thus, the direct- 3 DP was considered to be superior than the indirect- 3 DP as a fabrication method. In the alternative CNC machining approach to fabrication, the ability to machine the CPP ceramic was feasible and by careful selection of the machining conditions, anatomically-shaped CPP substrates were produced. To develop strategies for optimizing the machining process, a mechanistic model was developed based on curve fitting the average cutting forces to determine the cutting coefficients for CPP. These cutting coefficients were functions of workpiece material, axial depth of cut, <b>chip</b> <b>width,</b> and cutter geometry. To explore the utility of this modelling approach, cutting forces were predicted for a helical ball-end mill and compared with experimental results. The cutting force simulation exhibits good agreement in predicting the fundamental force magnitude and general shape of the actual forces. However, there were some discrepancies between the predicted and measured forces. These differences were attributed to internal microstructure defects, density gradients, and the use of a shear plane model in force prediction that was not entirely appropriate for brittle materials such as CPP. The present study successfully developed 3 DP and CNC fabrication methods for manufacturing anatomically-shaped CPP substrates. Future studies were recommended to explore further optimization of these fabrication methods and to demonstrate the utility of accurate substrates shapes to the clinical application of focal defect repair implants...|$|E

Metal cutting {{subjects}} {{the material}} being cut to high strain rates (103 - 106 /s) and strains> 100 % within the primary shear zone (PSZ). This thesis {{is aimed at}} quantitative measurement of the strain, strain rate and flow stress in the PSZ {{in order to provide}} data {{that can be used to}} verify and improve high strain rate material models. An experimental study of the cutting forces, chip thickness, and velocity fields in the PSZ, has been carried out during the cutting of AISI 4340 steel in three different tempers; hot rolled steel, hardness 18 HRc, referred to as AISI 4340 HR; hot rolled steel with additional 50 % cold rolling, hardness 27 HRc referred to as AISI 4340 CR; Heat treated (quenched and tempered) steel, hardness 45 HRc, referred to as AISI 4340 HT; and Titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Kennametal make KC 510 M inserts with edge radius 6 μm is used for all the cutting experiments reported and is mounted on a tool holder which provides a rake angle of 30 o and a clearance angle of 4 o. The KC 510 M inserts are used in an effort to minimize the side spread of the material. A new type of ultra high-speed camera is used to capture sequential and high resolution microphotographs of the PSZ during machining at frame rates ranging from a few kHz to 1 MHz. The velocity fields are obtained by 2 D cross-correlation of sequential images and the gradient of the velocity field yields the strain rate field. Each experiment yields four to seven strain rate fields from which the average strain rate field is obtained. Average strain rate fields found in multiple experiments are averaged to obtain the overall average strain rate for the cutting condition. As the shear velocity (Vs) needs to be same throughout the <b>chip</b> <b>width</b> for the chip to be moving as a rigid body, the shear angle has to be constant from the sides to the mid-section of the chip. Two independent estimates of the shear angle, from the velocity field and from the chip thickness, show reasonable correlation. The shear angle from chip thickness is an average over each experiment, while the shear angle from velocities is an instantaneous value and is taken to be the true value. The 'indentation' component of the cutting forces is calculated from the measured cutting forces using the ratio of flow stress in the PSZ to the contact pressure observed in finite element analysis (FEA) simulations. The flow stress along the nominal shear plane is computed from the measured shear angle and cutting forces, after removal of the 'indentation' component. The thickness of the PSZ is smaller and the peak strain rate is higher for AISI 4340 CR compared to AISI 4340 HR, due to reduced work hardening. While the forces are found to be nearly the same, the vii shear angle is larger and the flow stress is smaller for the AISI 4340 CR material. For the AISI 4340 HT, the flow stress is found to be about 10 - 20 % larger compared to AISI 4340 HR. The PSZ is typically parallel sided and shows a single peak in the CD direction along the PSZ while cutting AISI 4340 HR, AISI 4340 CR, AISI 4340 HT and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. The strain rate near the cutting edge is high and gradually decreases as we move towards the free end while cutting AISI 4340 HR and AISI 4340 CR. The strain rate near the cutting edge and the free end of the PSZ is high but lower in the middle of the PSZ, while cutting AISI 4340 HT. The mode of deformation while cutting AISI 4340 HR and AISI 4340 CR is inhomogeneous, meaning the same regions of the work material accumulate deformation and the shear ‘plane’ moves with the material over time, till eventually switching over to a new shear ‘plane’. The high-speed images of the PSZ while cutting Ti- 6 Al- 4 V clearly show localized bands of shear separated by larger bands of less deformed material, implying the deformation continues to concentrate within the same region of the material. The chip is thinner and quantitatively shows that the shear band is at the same region with respect to the workpiece. We have compared and contrasted the deformation process of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V with that of AISI 4340 HR and AISI 4340 CR. For the same cutting speed and feed, the strain rate while machining Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is higher and the PSZ narrower when compared to AISI 4340 CR...|$|E
40|$|Optical Code Division Multiple Access (OCDMA) {{is capable}} of {{providing}} future local area networks with higher connectivity, asynchronous multiple access and flexible bandwidth management. Much of the increased activity in this area has resulted from improvements in Fibre Bragg grating (FBG) fabrication technology driven mainly by the stringent requirements of DWDM. It is now possible to design and reliably fabricate superstructured fibre Bragg gratings (SSFBGs) with truly complex amplitude and phase responses [1], opening {{the possibility of using}} SSFBG components to perform fundamental OCDMA functions such as the coding and decoding of chip patterns described herein. In earlier work we demonstrated the generation of seven-chip, direct sequence, unipolar (amplitude) code OCDMA bits at 125 MHz using a SSFBG, and demonstrated optical pattern recognition using a matched SSFBG filter as a decoder [2]. In this paper we present results on upgrading the SSFBG approach to both far higher data rates (10 Gbit/s) and far shorter chip-lengths (6. 4 ps) with far higher grating reflectivity (up to 50 %) than previously demonstrated by fabricating bipolar (phase) coding and decoding SSFBGs using our continuous scanning technique. We present the results of BER measurements at 10 GBit/s on a decoded pulse sequence both before and after transmission through 25 km of standard fibre which show there to be no noise-penalty associated with the either the coding:decoding process, or due to transmission of the coded pulse itself. Our experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1 a and comprises a 10 Gbit/s, ~ 2 ps pulse transmitter (based on a regeneratively mode-locked, soliton fibre ring laser operating at 10 GHz), bipolar coding and decoding gratings, and an (optional) 25 km standard fibre transmission span which had its dispersion compensated with a chirped FBG. We fabricated seven-chip M-sequence, bipolar coding and decoding gratings. The total grating length in each instance was 4. 64 mm (corresponding to a temporal code length of 44. 8 µs) and the individual <b>chip</b> <b>width</b> was 0. 66 mm (corresponding to a chip length of 6. 4 ps). The bipolar grating design is shown inset in Fig. 1 a, and is a pure phase-encoded structure with discrete n phase shifts at the (NRZ) chip transition boundaries. The experimental and theoretical plots are shown in Fig. lb. The agreement between the theoretical and experimental spectral responses of the bipolar SSFBG is seen to be excellent, highlighting the precision of our grating writing process. The decoder grating is essentially identical to the encoder grating other than it has a spatially-reversed refractive index superstructure. Note that all of gratings used in these experiments (including the dispersion compensating FBG) were written by appropriate W exposure through the same, uniform period phase mask. Since the SSFBGs are relatively weak and within the Fourier theory grating design limit, the impulse response of the grating in the time domain is given by the superstructure modulation profile used to write the grating. We examined the intensity autocorrelation functions of the incident 2 ps pulses on reflection from the individual coding:decoding gratings, and found the profiles to be in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions as shown in Fig. 2 a. This includes the decoder response to the code after it has propagated over the 25 km dispersion-compensated transmission line, there is evidence of some correlation signal degradation, however the effects are slight, and in fact negligible in terms of overall system performance. The spectral response of the decoded signal is also compared to the theoretical plot as shown inset in Fig 2 a. BER measurements were taken on the code:decode process, both with and without the 25 km transmission. The results are summarised in Fig. 2 b where it is seen that no power penalty associated with code-decode process is observed in either instance. Eye diagrams for both the simple code:decode and transmitted code:decode case are shown inset within Fig. 2 b. No evidence of temporal features away from the main, chip-length long, correlation peak is observed as expected. In conclusion we have demonstrated high-quality, 10 Gbit/s bipolar OCDMA coding and decoding using superstructured FBGs with a code chip rate of 160 Gbit/s. Error-free operation with no power penalty was obtained for the coding:decoding process after propagation of the code through 25 km of fibre. These results highlight the precision and flexibility of our particular grating writing process and point to further applications of SSFBGs in future high-speed optical networks. For example our results demonstrate the possibility of using SSFBGs for header recognition in 160 Gbit/s OTDM based networks. Fig 1 (a) Experimental set up.
