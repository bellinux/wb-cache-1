5000|$|Information gained {{during recent}} {{epidemics}} suggests that chikungunya fever {{may result in}} a chronic phase as well as the phase of acute illness. Within the acute phase, two stages have been identified: a viral stage during the first five to seven days, during which viremia occurs, followed by a <b>convalescent</b> <b>stage</b> lasting approximately ten days, during which symptoms improve and the virus cannot be detected in the blood. Typically, the disease begins with a sudden high fever that lasts from a few days to a week, and sometimes up to ten days. The fever is usually above [...] and sometimes reaching [...] and may be biphasic—lasting several days, breaking, and then returning. Fever occurs with the onset of viremia, and the level of virus in the blood correlates with the intensity of symptoms in the acute phase. When IgM, an antibody that is a response to the initial exposure to an antigen, appears in the blood, viremia begins to diminish. However, headache, insomnia and an extreme degree of exhaustion remain, usually about five to seven days.|$|E

Results: Among these 94 positive sera from <b>convalescent</b> <b>stages</b> of the illness and 82 sera from control farmers, the specificity of RDT was 100 % for both IgM and IgG tests.

A relative increase of OKT 8 + cells {{and at the same}} time of Leu 7 + cells was obtained in the active and convalescent BD stages. Double marker analysis revealed that the sub-population of cells expressing both the T 8 + and the Leu 7 + antigen (T 8 +/Leu 7 +) was increased in patients with active stage, and normal in the <b>convalescent</b> <b>stage.</b> The frequency of cells reactive with Leu 11 monoclonal antibody (active NK cells) was evaluated in patients with BD.

40|$|In healthy {{controls}} (n = 8) {{living in}} shigella endemic areas, accumulation of interferon gamma (IFN gamma) in the epithelial lining {{was seen in}} the rectal tissues. At the single cell level, however, few or no IFN gamma protein producing cells or mRNA expressing cells were detected at that site indicating the involvement of the whole large intestine in the production of IFN gamma in controls. Persistent numbers of IFN gamma producing cells were detected in the rectum of patients with Shigella dysenteriae type 1 infection (n = 8) throughout the course of disease with a tendency to increase in the <b>convalescent</b> <b>stage.</b> A significantly increased extra cellular deposition of secreted IFN gamma in tissue was seen in convalescence when compared with the acute stage (p < 0. 05). In addition, enzyme immunoassay showed increased stool concentration of IFN gamma in patients at the <b>convalescent</b> <b>stage</b> as well as in healthy controls. In situ hybridisation confirmed the results by showing increased frequency of IFN gamma mRNA containing cells at the late stage of the disease (p < 0. 05). Extensive message for IFN gamma was evident in cells in the lamina propria with no detectable transcripts in the surface epithelium. A colocalisation of IFN gamma with the IFN gamma receptor expression, predominantly found in the epithelial lining was detected by immunohistochemistry. Semiquantitative evaluation by computerised image analysis showed a gradual increased expression of IFN gamma and its corresponding receptor in the <b>convalescent</b> <b>stage</b> of shigellosis. This suggested progressive entrapment and binding of IFN gamma to its specific receptor at the local site. The enhanced surface expression of IFN gamma receptor evident at the <b>convalescent</b> <b>stage</b> of shigellosis was comparable to the constitutive level of expression in the healthy subjects. Thus, immunity to shigellosis correlated to up-regulation of IFN gamma production and expression of IFN gamma receptor...|$|E

40|$|When {{following}} Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada disease (VKH), indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) {{is crucial}} in the subacute and <b>convalescent</b> <b>stages</b> of the disease in order to detect subclinical choroiditis and prevent the development of ‘sunset glow’ fundus. Hypofluorescent dark dots (HDDs) indicate persisting granulomas in the choroid. However, probably {{as a result of}} the healing process of choroidal granulomas, stromal choroidal fibrosis can also be shown by HDDs. We present two cases where intravenous corticosteroid administration because of persistent HDDs led to resolution of lesions in one case while they persisted in the other case. We reviewed the medical history of two VKH patients. Complete routine work-up for patients with posterior uveitis was performed. The charts were screened for the presence of HDDs by ICGA in the subacute and <b>convalescent</b> <b>stages</b> of the disease before and after administration of body weight-adapted pulse intravenous methylprednisolone (PIM). The evolution of HDDs was studied and compared in both patients. A female patient presented with a persistent bilateral granulomatous panuveitis compatible with VKH. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis had shown lymphocytic pleocytosis. At presentation, therapy consisted of oral prednisone 80 mg/day. Prednisone was tapered down to 22 mg/day over 3 months, when a recurrence occurred with the presence of disseminated HDDs. PIM was administered, followed by oral corticosteroids. After 8 days of therapy, ICGA showed an almost complete disappearance of HDDs. A girl presented with bilateral panuveitis and widespread depigmented areas of her fundus. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed monocytic pleocytosis. Because of relative resistance to oral inflammation suppressive therapy (IST), PIM was administered for 3 days. Nevertheless, ICGA showed persistence of HDDs. Therapy was continued, and 3 months later, a follow-up ICGA still depicted numerous HDDs. Another PIM course was given, which had no effect on ICGA signs. HDDs in this case were interpreted as stromal choroidal scars. ICGA-guided therapy (mainly HDD evolution monitoring) helps to eradicate occult stromal disease in VKH and avoids ‘sunset glow’ fundus, by allowing precise adjustment of therapy. In some cases, HDDs do not represent active lesions but presumed intrastromal scars which need to be identified. A limited course of maximal IST including PIM can unmask such cases and avoid overtreatment of these patients...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Current imaging {{modalities}} used in {{the evaluation}} of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease include ultrasound, fluorescein angiogram, indocyanine green angiography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). However, they all fail to give detailed information on the ultrastructural changes of the choroid. A recent technique using OCT termed "enhanced depth imaging" produces high-resolution cross-sectional images of the whole thickness of the choroid. The {{purpose of the study was}} to describe a novel imaging finding in the choroid in cases of VKH uveitis and to assess for interobserver agreement of this new physical sign. METHODS: This is an age-matched, sex-matched, and spherical equivalent-matched, case-control, cross-sectional study. Six VKH patients in acute and <b>convalescent</b> <b>stages</b> underwent choroidal imaging using enhanced depth imaging spectral-domain OCT imaging. A horizontal enhanced depth imaging spectral-domain OCT scan across the fovea was selected for each eye and was compared with a scan from an age-matched, sex-matched, and spherical equivalent-matched control subject. A loss of focal hyperreflectivity, represented by a decrease in the number of hyperreflective dots in the inner choroid, was observed. This finding was assessed for interobserver agreement using five masked observers. Mean observed agreement and multirater kappa statistics (κ) were calculated. The average choroidal thickness was also calculated and compared among acute-phase VKH patients, convalescent-phase VKH patients, and control subjects. RESULTS: There was a significant loss of focal hyperreflectivity in the inner choroid of VKH patients compared with control subjects in both acute and <b>convalescent</b> <b>stages.</b> Analysis revealed substantial interobserver agreement on this finding. The mean observed agreement was 95 %, and the overall kappa coefficient (κ) was 0. 80 (P < 0. 01). The choroid of acute-phase VKH patients was thicker than that of convalescent-phase patients by 151 μm (P = 0. 043) and control subjects by 137 μm (P = 0. 001). There was no statistically significant difference in thickness between convalescent eyes and controls. CONCLUSION: Enhanced depth imaging spectral-domain OCT highlights a loss of focal hyperreflectivity in the inner choroid of eyes with VKH, a feature that is consistently observed by independent masked observers. The presence of this feature in both acute and convalescent phases could represent permanent structural change to small choroidal vessels caused by VKH uveitis. © The Ophthalmic Communications Society, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a {{small vessel}} {{vasculitis}} characterized by increased serum IgA and IgA-dominant immune complex deposition in lesions. The involvement of IgA implies a probable role for TGF-β, {{a major factor in}} IgA production, in the pathogenesis of HSP. Among IgA antibodies, serum IgA anti-cardiolipin antibodies (aCL) have been found in many diseases, including vasculitis. In addition to the clinical presentations and laboratory parameters, we further investigated the roles of IgA aCL and TGF-β in childhood HSP. Twenty-six Chinese children with the diagnosis of HSP were enrolled. Blood samples from these patients were collected at both acute and convalescent stages. Intracellular staining of lymphocytes was performed to enumerate type 1 (interferon-gamma-secreting), type 2 (IL- 4 -secreting), and type 3 (TGF-β-secreting) helper T cells. Serum levels of TGF-β were detected by ELISA. Serum IgA aCL of 21 of 26 patients at the acute stage, 11 of them at the <b>convalescent</b> <b>stage,</b> were measured by ELISA. The data showed that IgA aCL serum levels were significantly elevated in patients compared with healthy controls (P < 0 · 001), and those patients at the <b>convalescent</b> <b>stage</b> (P < 0 · 001). In addition, TGF-β-secreting T cells were significantly elevated during the acute stage, and decreased at the <b>convalescent</b> <b>stage.</b> Although more studies are needed, the high prevalence of IgA aCL and increased TGF-β-secreting T cells in children with acute HSP revealed some points which should permit {{a better understanding of the}} pathogenesis of HSP...|$|E

The present study was undertaken to investigate the ability of T cells from fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of such patients to produce hTCHF. The PBMC, as well as the individual subpopulations, were cultured for 24 h and the culture supernatants (CS) were assayed for hypoglycaemic activity. The activity was observed in the CD 8 + T cells. The hypoglycaemia in JE-confirmed patients coincided with the gradual rise in circulating glucagon level, with no significant alterations in insulin, growth hormone and cortisol levels. The hTCHF was purified by ion exchange chromatography and the purified protein was observed as a ∼ 25 kDa band on SDS-PAGE. Secretory hTCHF in the sera of patients and T cell CS was present in 88 % of convalescent serum samples.

A 75  g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was given in the acute stage of ocular inflammation before systemic corticosteroid therapy. The OGTT was repeated in the <b>convalescent</b> <b>stage</b> of VKH disease in the patients with glucose intolerance before treatment. Insulin response was examined {{at the same time}} as the OGTT when possible.  RESULTS— 55 % of VKH patients (11 / 20) showed glucose intolerance but no apparent insulin secretion deficiency was detected.

In Ivory Coast, the locality of Divo must be considered an at-risk zone in reason of the presence of anti-Paragonimus antibodies in several human sera and the presence of infected crabs at the local market...|$|R

Methods: The visual fields, electroretinograms (ERGs), and OCT images were reviewed in two women aged 24 and 33 years. The patients were followed for one and four years, respectively. Results: In both cases, the anterior and posterior segments were almost normal, although both patients had a sudden unilateral vision decrease and photopsia. Goldmann perimetry revealed enlarged blind spots and scotomas. The ERGs were reduced in both cases. SD-OCT showed that the junction of {{the inner and outer}} segment, the IS/OS line, of the photoreceptors was irregular or lost in the affected retinas. The retina in these areas was thinner due to a decrease in the thickness of both the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and inner nuclear layer (INL) in Case 2. Conclusions: The decrease in retinal thickness at the <b>convalescent</b> <b>stage</b> of AZOOR is most likely due to a shortening of not only the photoreceptors and ONL but also to a thinning of the INL in a severe case.

40|$|Production of cytokines by {{peripheral}} blood mononuclear cells from Shigella-infected patients was assessed. The frequencies of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), TNF-beta, and transforming growth factor beta mRNA-expressing cells were persistently upregulated {{during the course}} of shigellosis in comparison to those of healthy controls. In contrast, the frequency of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) mRNA-expressing cells was significantly reduced during the acute stage compared to that during the <b>convalescent</b> <b>stage</b> and to that of healthy Bangladeshi controls (P < 0. 01). Constitutive IFN-gamma production in Bangladeshi controls was significantly upregulated compared to that in Swedish controls...|$|E
40|$|The antilipopolysaccharide {{antibody}} {{response in}} sera obtained from subjects involved in 10 outbreaks of shigellosis occurring in Israeli military field units {{was determined by}} an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a passive hemagglutination test. Both tests {{were found to be}} sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of shigellosis. A significant antibody response was detected in 73 to 82 % of the symptomatic and 48 to 60 % of the asymptomatic subjects during the Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri outbreaks. Fifty percent of the symptomatic and none of the asymptomatic subjects showed a significant antibody response in the Shigella boydii outbreaks. An examination of the kinetics of the antibody levels over a 10 -week period after the onset of disease revealed that immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels were highest 2 weeks after infection and had declined to initial levels within 2. 5 months. In contrast, IgG levels at the late <b>convalescent</b> <b>stage</b> were half those measured at early convalescence, still being about twice as high as the initial titers. Although the IgM levels showed a pattern similar to that of IgA, their elevation at the early <b>convalescent</b> <b>stage</b> was less pronounced. We conclude that the detection of an increase in the level of the IgA fraction appeared to be the best indicator for recent symptomatic, as well as symptomatic, infections due to Shigella organisms...|$|E
40|$|The radial {{distribution}} of Plasmodium vivax malaria burden has evoked enormous concern among the global research community. In this study, we {{have investigated the}} serum proteome alterations in non-severe vivax malaria patients before and during patient recuperation starting from the early febrile to the defervescence and <b>convalescent</b> <b>stages</b> of the infection. We have also performed an extensive quantitative proteomics analysis to compare the serum proteome profiles of vivax malaria patients with low (LPVM) and moderately-high (MPVM) parasitemia with healthy community controls. Interestingly, some of the serum proteins such as Serum amyloid A, Apolipoprotein A 1, C-reactive protein, Titin and Haptoglobin, {{were found to be}} sequentially altered with respect to increased parasite counts. Analysis of a longitudinal cohort of malaria patients indicated reversible alterations in serum levels of some proteins such as Haptoglobin, Apolipoprotein E, Apolipoprotein A 1, Carbonic anhydrase 1, and Hemoglobin subunit alpha upon treatment; however, the levels of a few other proteins did not return to the baseline even during the convalescent phase of the infection. Here we present the first comprehensive serum proteomics analysis of vivax malaria patients with different levels of parasitemia and during the acute and convalescent phases of the infection...|$|R
40|$|We {{searched for}} {{antibodies}} against Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis proteins in the sera {{of patients with}} lower respiratory tract infection. Sera from 48 patients with M. catarrhalis and 39 patients without M. catarrhalis in their lower respiratory tract specimens were studied by a gel electrophoresis-immunoperoxidase technique; sera from 23 healthy adult blood donors were also included. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against a 28 -kDa protein were found significantly more frequently in patients with M. catarrhalis in lower respiratory tract specimens (71 %) than in patients without M. catarrhalis in lower respiratory tract specimens (28 %) or healthy adult blood donors (22 %). Seroconversion, from the acute to the <b>convalescent</b> <b>stages,</b> occurred in at least eight patients with M. catarrhalis and in one patient without detectable M. catarrhalis. IgG antibodies against other M. catarrhalis proteins were found in most sera, including those obtained from blood donors. By adsorption experiments the 28 -kDa protein was demonstrated to be surface exposed. IgM antibodies against an 85 -kDa protein were found in serum from one patient from whom M. catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were isolated from the lower respiratory tract, while IgA antibodies against M. catarrhalis proteins could not be detected in any serum specimen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Male {{and female}} Wistar rats 2 to 15 {{months of age}} were inoculated intranasally with sialoda-cryoadenitis (SDA) virus and killed at 8 to 2 1 days post-inoculation (PI). Submandibular glands were {{evaluated}} by light and electron microscopy, and levels of salivary gland epidermal growth factor (EGF) were quantitated by cytochemistry and competitive radioreceptor assay. Apical granules in the epithelial cells of the granular convoluted tubules (GCT) were selectively depleted during the acute and <b>convalescent</b> <b>stages</b> of the disease. In addition, levels of immunoreactive EGF were reduced in affected submandibular glands, especially at 8 to 14 days PI with SDA virus, but some evidence of EGF depletion was seen at up to 3 weeks PI. A corresponding transient depletion of EGF receptor reactive salivary EGF was seen between 1 and 3 weeks after experimental SDA infection. These studies suggest that a clinical (or subclinical) infection with SDA virus could have significant effects on experimental studies on EGF-dependent functions, including reproductive physiology and carcino-genesis. In 1962, Cohen isolated a protein from mouse sub-mandibular salivary glands which, when injected into newborn mice and rats, accelerated incisor eruption and eyelid ~ p e n i n g. ~ Referred to as epidermal growt...|$|R
