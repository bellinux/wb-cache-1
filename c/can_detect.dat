5|$|Because {{molecular}} diagnostics methods <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> sensitive markers, {{these tests}} are less intrusive than a traditional biopsy. For example, because cell-free nucleic acids exist in human plasma, a simple blood sample can {{be enough to}} sample genetic information from tumours, transplants or an unborn fetus. Many, but not all, molecular diagnostics methods based on nucleic acids detection use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to vastly {{increase the number of}} nucleic acid molecules, thereby amplifying the target sequence(s) in the patient sample. The detection of the marker might use real time PCR, direct sequencing, or microarray chipsprefabricated chips that test many markers at once. The same principle applies to the proteome and the genome. High-throughput protein arrays can use complementary DNA or antibodies to bind and hence <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> many different proteins in parallel.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium zinc {{telluride}} (CZT) is a semiconductive alloy {{that can}} be divided into an array of small sensing devices. These devices are similar to an integrated circuit and <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> the energy of incoming gamma ray photons. When behind an absorbing mask, the CZT sensor array can determine the direction of the rays.|$|E

CVPD is caused by gram negative bacteria, they <b>can</b> <b>detected</b> by using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of 16 S rDNA and electron microscopy. The mechanism of interaction of causal pathogen CVPD with plant is poorly known, so that this reseatch aimed to detect the pathogen in various citrus plant by PCR. The research resulted that the pathogen in various citrus plant is L. asiaticum, they <b>can</b> <b>detected</b> by PCR at 1160 bp...|$|R
5|$|Like other insects, flies have chemoreceptors that detect {{smell and}} taste, and mechanoreceptors that respond to touch. The third {{segments}} of the antennae and the maxillary palps bear the main olfactory receptors, while the gustatory receptors are in the labium, pharynx, feet, wing margins and female genitalia, enabling flies to taste their food by walking on it. The taste receptors in females {{at the tip of}} the abdomen receive information on the suitability of a site for ovipositing. Flies that feed on blood have special sensory structures that <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts, and many blood-sucking flies <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> the raised concentration of carbon dioxide that occurs near large animals. Some tachinid flies (Ormiinae) which are parasitoids of bush crickets, have sound receptors to help them locate their singing hosts.|$|E
5|$|Adult female rabbit fleas, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> the {{changing}} levels of cortisol and corticosterone hormones in the rabbit's blood that indicate {{it is getting}} close to giving birth. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they start producing eggs. As soon as the baby rabbits are born, the fleas make their way down to them and once on board they start feeding, mating, and laying eggs. After 12 days, the adult fleas make {{their way back to}} the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the eyes}} of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor visual acuity, no species is blind. Microbats have mesopic vision, meaning that they can only detect light in low levels, whereas other mammals have {{photopic}} vision, which allows colour vision. Microbats may use their vision for orientation and while they are travelling between their roosting grounds and their feeding grounds, as echolocation is only effective over short distances. Some species <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> ultraviolet (UV). As the bodies of some microbats have distinct coloration, {{they may be able}} to discriminate colours.|$|E

5|$|Amyloid imaging {{is likely}} to be used in {{conjunction}} with other markers rather than as an alternative. Volumetric MRI <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> changes in the size of brain regions. Measuring those regions that atrophy during the progress of Alzheimer's disease is showing promise as a diagnostic indicator. It may prove less expensive than other imaging methods currently under study.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{including}} {{birds and}} turtles <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> the Earth's magnetic field, {{and use the}} field to navigate during migration. Some {{researchers have found that}} cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north-south while relaxing, but not when the animals are under high-voltage power lines, suggesting that magnetism is responsible. Other researchers reported in 2011 that they could not replicate those findings using different Google Earth images.|$|E
5|$|Because the cuticle layers are {{arranged}} in rows, with a cylindrical curve, {{the amount of the}} second type of reflection is dependent on the polarization of the incoming light. This makes the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent. Many insects <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> polarization of light, so it has been proposed that this feature may be used as a visual signal between moths. This has not yet been studied, however.|$|E

5|$|Beetle {{antennae}} {{are primarily}} organs of sensory perception and <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> motion, odour and chemical substances, {{but may also}} be used to physically feel a beetle's environment. Beetle families may use antennae in different ways.

5|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) scans and Technetium-99m bone scans {{are also}} sometimes {{used to monitor}} the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), CT scans and MRI scans can show the exact location and extent of the lesion. Technetium bone scans <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> regional blood flow {{and the amount of}} osseous uptake. Both of these seem to be closely correlated to the potential for healing in the fragment.|$|E
5|$|For instance, the {{periodontal}} ligament <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> {{the pressure}} exerted when biting on something {{smaller than a}} grain of sand (10-30µm). When a tooth is intentionally stimulated, about 33% of people can correctly identify the tooth, and about 20% cannot narrow the stimulus location down {{to a group of}} three teeth. Another typical difference between pulpal and periodontal pain is that the latter is not usually made worse by thermal stimuli.|$|E

5|$|Grasshoppers {{have the}} typical insect body plan of head, thorax and abdomen. The head is held {{vertically}} {{at an angle}} to the body, with the mouth at the bottom. The head bears a large pair of compound eyes which give all-round vision, three simple eyes which <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> light and dark, and a pair of thread-like antennae that are sensitive to touch and smell. The downward-directed mouthparts are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in front of the jaws.|$|E
5|$|Great white sharks, {{like all}} other sharks, have an extra sense given by the ampullae of Lorenzini which enables them to detect the {{electromagnetic}} field emitted by the movement of living animals. Great whites are so sensitive they <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> variations of half a billionth of a volt. At close range, this allows the shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body's lateral line.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bivalves}} have no eyes, but a {{few members}} of the Arcoidea, Limopsoidea, Mytiloidea, Anomioidea, Ostreoidea, and Limoidea have simple eyes on the margin of the mantle. These consist of a pit of photosensory cells and a lens. Scallops have more complex eyes with a lens, a two-layered retina, and a concave mirror. All bivalves have light-sensitive cells that <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> a shadow falling over the animal.|$|E

5|$|Many insects possess very {{sensitive}} and, or specialized organs of perception. Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) {{is known for}} its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound; while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2kHz, and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively. For instance, some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats, which helps them avoid predation. Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds spend {{many months}} at a time at sea, so they must sleep in the water. Scientists have {{recorded}} them sleeping for minutes at a time while slowly drifting downward in a belly-up orientation. Like other marine mammals, seals sleep in water with half of their brain awake so that they <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> and escape from predators. When they are asleep on land, both sides of their brain go into sleep mode.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{can swim}} rather slowly by {{opening and closing}} its valves. It {{advances}} in this way with {{the rim of the}} shell to the front. It <b>can</b> <b>detect</b> the movement of nearby objects with its rudimentary eyes and, in order to escape predators, can move much more swiftly umbones first, by clapping its valves shut. A remotely controlled camera stationed on the sea bed is apt to find that all the scallops that were originally in its field of view have moved off to other locations.|$|E
