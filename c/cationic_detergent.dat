40|$|A {{study of}} the effects of {{synthetic}} detergents and wetting agents on respiration and glycolysis of Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms has led to the following conclusions. 1. All the <b>cationic</b> <b>detergents</b> studied are very effective inhibitors of bacterial metabolism at 1 : 3000 concentration, and several are equally active at 1 : 30, 000. Few of the anionic detergents inhibit as effectively as the cationic compounds. 2. Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms are equally sensitive to the action of the <b>cationic</b> <b>detergents.</b> On the other hand, all the anionic detergents included in our studies selectively inhibit the metabolism of Gram-positive microorganisms. 3. The inhibitory action of both types of detergents is influenced markedly by hydrogen ion concentration. <b>Cationic</b> <b>detergents</b> exhibit their maximum activity in the alkaline pH range, and the anionic, in the acid range. 4. Studies of homologous series of straight chain alkyl sulfates and sulfoacetates (C 8 to C 18) demonstrate that maximum inhibition is exerted by the 12, 14, and 16 carbon compounds (lauryl, myristyl, and cetyl). 5. It has been observed that three lauryl esters of amino acids are powerful inhibitors of bacterial metabolism. To our knowledge, the effects on bacterial metabolism of such <b>cationic</b> <b>detergents</b> (without the quaternary ammonium structure) have not been studied previously. Our results demonstrate that other <b>cationic</b> <b>detergents</b> can exhibit an inhibitory activity comparable to quaternary ammonium compounds. 6.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{influence}} of pH {{value on the}} antibacterial action of subtilin A has been demonstrated by survivor counts, inhibition of respiration, and pH gradient plates. Staphylococcus aureus is more sensitive to subtilin as the pH value increases; Eschmichia coli is more sensitive as the pH value decreases. The results are analogous to those obtained by other investigators working with <b>cationic</b> <b>detergents,</b> and {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that the basic surface-active antibiotics kill bacteria by the same general mechanism as do the quaternary ammonium germicides. A sur-vey of the growth inhibition of other organisms on pH gradient plates indicates that Bacillus cereus behaves like S. aureus, while B. wgaterium, Corpebactem'um poin-settiae, and Streptococcus faecalis behave like E. coli. A pH/rnobility curve for subtilin A, obtained by paper electrophoretic studies, indicates no striking changes in the charge of the molecule over the pH range 4 ~ 9, although the presence of at least one free a-amino group is indicated by inflexion points in the range of pH 6 - 7. The isoelectric point of subtilin A at ionic strength 0. 1 is approximately 6 - 7. The use of sectored, square-shaped Petri dishes for pH-gradient plate studies with germicides is described. The effect of pH value on the germicidal action of <b>cationic</b> <b>detergents</b> is complex: some organisms, including Staphylococcus aurm, are more suscep-tible as the pH value increases, others, including Escherichiu coli, are more sensitive as the pH value decreases (Salton, 1950). No explanation has been offered to account for this behaviour. Since the discovery by Dubos & Hotch-kiss (1942) that tyrocidine shares many of the antibacterial properties of the <b>cationic</b> <b>detergents,</b> a number of surface-active polypeptide antibiotics have been shown to belong to this group of germicides (Newton, 1953; Anderson...|$|R

40|$|P-glycoprotein-ATPase is an efflux {{transporter}} {{of broad}} specificity that counteracts passive allocrit influx. Understanding {{the rate of}} allocrit transport therefore matters. Generally, the rate of allocrit transport and ATP hydrolysis decrease exponentially with increasing allocrit affinity to the transporter. Here we report unexpectedly strong down-modulation of the P-glycoprotein-ATPase by certain detergents. To elucidate the underlying mechanism we chose 34 electrically neutral and <b>cationic</b> <b>detergents</b> with different hydrophobic and hydrophilic characteristics. Measurement of the P-glycoprotein-ATPase activity {{as a function of}} concentration showed that seven detergents activated the ATPase as expected, while 27 closely related ones reduced it significantly. Assessment of the free energy of detergent partitioning into the lipid membrane and the free energy of detergent binding from the membrane to the transporter revealed that the ratio q of the two free energies of binding determined the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Neutral (<b>cationic)</b> <b>detergents</b> with a ratio q= 2. 7 ± 0. 2 (q< 3) followed the aforementioned exponential dependence. Small deviations from the optimal ratio strongly reduced the rates ATP hydrolysis and flopping, respectively, while larger deviations lead to the lack of an interaction with the transporter.

40|$|By {{treating}} fibrin with <b>cationic</b> <b>detergent</b> in {{a medium}} containing 5 M urea, a fibrin-cationic detergent complex was formed. The complex was soluble in distilled water, and was observed {{to be in a}} dispersed state by electron microscopy. The complex was precipitated and resolubilized in the presence of salt. This behavior of the complex was due to adsorption of the salt anions onto the complex. When an aqueous solution of the complex was incubated with fresh serum, the complex soon aggregated and then was converted into a firm clot which was not soluble in distilled water. In the previous study (1), fibrinogen was found to bind <b>cationic</b> <b>detergent</b> effectively, and the detergent molecules were shown to remain attached to the protein even after the action of thrombin [EC 3. 4. 21. 5] and to in-hibit the series of reactions which result in the formation of fibrils.

40|$|Background: We have {{previously}} described {{a method for}} the refolding of chemically denatured proteins in which small molecules (‘artificial chaperones’, a detergent and cyclodextrin) assist renaturation. In a previous analysis of lysozyme refolding from the GdmCl-denatured, DTT-reduced state, we found that enzymatic activity is regained at indistinguishable rates for unassisted (absence of additives) and artificial-chaperone-assisted refolding. While unassisted and artificial-chaperone-assisted refolding rates could also be directly compared for GdmCl-denatured bovine carbonic anhydrase B (CAB), only <b>cationic</b> <b>detergents</b> {{could be used as}} assistants. We therefore set out to determine whether artificial chaperones could assist the refolding of urea-denatured CAB, whether the charge and structure of the detergent used affects refolding assistance, and, if so, whether the assistance is mechanistically similar to that observed for GdmCl-denatured CAB. Results: Our results indicate that CAB can be refolded from the urea-denatured state via the artificial chaperone process, using both anionic and <b>cationic</b> <b>detergents.</b> There is a distinctive product-determining step early in the artificial-chaperone-assisted refolding mechanism, but the rate-determining steps of the unassisted and artificial-chaperone-assisted processes are indistinguishable. Conclusions:Because the rate-determining steps of unassisted and artificial-chaperone-assisted refolding are indistinguishable, we conclude that the rate-determining step of CAB refolding is unaffected by the use of artificial chaperones. Our observations also suggest that denatured CAB undergoes a slow partial folding in concentrated urea solution...|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{renaturation}} for complementary DNA strands can {{be enhanced}} greater than 10 (4) -fold {{by the addition of}} simple <b>cationic</b> <b>detergents,</b> and the reaction is qualitatively and quantitatively very similar to that found with purified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A 1 protein. Under optimal conditions, renaturation rates are greater than 2000 -fold faster than reactions run in 1 M NaCl at 68 degrees C. The reaction is second-order with respect to DNA concentration, and reaction rates approach or equal the rate with which complementary strands are expected to encounter each other in solution. Renaturation can even be observed well above the expected melting temperature of the duplex DNA, demonstrating that some <b>cationic</b> <b>detergents</b> have DNA double-helix-stabilizing properties. The reaction is also extremely rapid in the presence of up to a 10 (6) -fold excess of noncomplementary sequences, establishing that renaturation is specific and relatively independent of heterologous DNA. This finding also implies that up to several thousand potential target sequences can be sampled per strand per second. Such reagents may be useful for procedures that require rapid nucleic acid renaturation, and these results suggest ways to identify and design other compounds that increase the kinetics of association reactions.
