5|$|Fructose, {{or fruit}} sugar, occurs {{naturally}} in fruits, some root vegetables, cane sugar and honey {{and is the}} sweetest of the sugars. It {{is one of the}} components of sucrose or table sugar. It is used as a high-fructose syrup, which is manufactured from hydrolyzed corn starch that has been processed to yield <b>corn</b> <b>syrup,</b> with enzymes then added to convert part of the glucose into fructose.|$|E
5|$|Both {{lifestyle}} changes and medications can decrease uric acid levels. Dietary and lifestyle choices that are effective include reducing intake of purine-rich foods {{of animal origin}} such as meat and seafood, alcohol, and fructose (especially high fructose <b>corn</b> <b>syrup).</b> Eating dairy products, vitamin C, coffee, and cherries may help prevent gout attacks, as does losing weight. Gout may be secondary to sleep apnea via the release of purines from oxygen-starved cells. Treatment of apnea can lessen the occurrence of attacks.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} {{state that}} colony collapse disorder is mainly {{a problem of}} feeding the bees a monoculture diet when they should receive food {{from a variety of}} sources/plants. In winter, these bees are given a single food source such as <b>corn</b> <b>syrup</b> (high-fructose or other), sugar and pollen substitute. In summer, they may only pollinate a single crop (e.g., almonds, cherries, or apples). The monoculture diet is attributed to bee rentals and migratory bee keeping. Honey bees are only being introduced to select commercial crops such as corn. These single pollen diets are greatly inferior to mixed pollen diets. However, there are a few pollens that are acceptable for honey bees to be introduced to exclusively, including sweet clover and mustard.|$|E

25|$|Heinz tomato ketchup’s {{ingredients}} are: {{tomato concentrate}} from red ripe tomatoes, distilled vinegar, high fructose <b>corn</b> <b>syrup,</b> <b>corn</b> <b>syrup,</b> salt, spice, onion powder, and natural flavoring. Tomato concentrate from red ripe tomatoes {{is the first}} ingredient on the list, which means it has {{the highest percentage of}} weight within the final product. Tomatoes have a complex composition of sugars, starch, pectin, ascorbic acids, organic acids, amino acids, steroids, carotenoids, lipids, free fatty acids, and volatiles. The second ingredient listed is distilled vinegar, which is eighty percent pure water and twenty percent acetic acid. Next is high fructose <b>corn</b> <b>syrup,</b> which is made up of 42% fructose, 53% glucose, and 5% other polysaccharides and sugars. <b>Corn</b> <b>syrup</b> is 100% glucose. Salt is the next ingredient listed and is composed of sodium and chloride ions. Spice, onion powder, and natural flavoring are the last ingredients on the list, meaning that they have the least percent weight. These three ingredients contribute to overall flavor of the product.|$|E

40|$|Commonly {{consumed}} carbohydrate sweeteners {{derived from}} sugar cane, palm, and <b>corn</b> (<b>syrups)</b> were investigated {{to determine their}} potential to inhibit key enzymes relevant to Type 2 diabetes and hypertension based on the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity using in vitro models. Among sugar cane derivatives, brown sugars showed higher antidiabetes potential than white sugars; nevertheless, no angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition was detected in both sugar classes. Brown sugar from Peru and Mauritius (dark muscovado) had the highest total phenolic content and 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity, which correlated with a moderate inhibition of yeast alpha-glucosidase without showing {{a significant effect on}} porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase activity. In addition, chlorogenic acid quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography was detected in these sugars (128 +/- 6 and 144 +/- 2 mu g/g of sample weight, respectively). Date sugar exhibited high alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, and ACE inhibitory activities that correlated with high total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Neither phenolic compounds or antioxidant activity was detected in <b>corn</b> <b>syrups,</b> indicating that nonphenolic factors may be involved in their significant ability to inhibit alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, and ACE. This study provides a strong biochemical rationale for further in vivo studies and useful information to make better dietary sweetener choices for Type 2 diabetes and hypertension management...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Basic and {{selected}} functional properties of sim-ple sugars, sugar alcohols, <b>corn</b> and maple <b>syrups,</b> honey, and high-fructose <b>corn</b> <b>syrups</b> are discussed. Properties {{that relate to}} sweetness and properties that play roles in component interaction {{as a basis for}} product formulation are described. The implications of such functionality are illustrated for the development of low-energy foods and for the microwave heating of foods. Among the properties discussed are solubility, hygroscopicity, crystallinity, and viscosity. Interrelations among water mobility, water activity, and hydration of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates are described in the context of food formulation.

40|$|International audienceTo {{examine the}} link between {{chalkbrood}} and treatments applied to honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies, growth of Ascosphaera apis was determined under chalkbrood-inducing conditions on agar containing crushed bee larvae as a mock infection. Treatments were tested at concentrations in the field, representative of beekeeping practice (at least in the USA). A chilling or warming stress known to heighten chalkbrood caused no growth enhancement of A. apis. Miticides had a negative effect; formic acid killed A. apis and oxalic acid reduced growth by 70  %. High-fructose <b>corn</b> <b>syrups</b> and sucrose syrup undiluted, a 50 : 50 mixture, alone, and with antibiotics did not alter growth of A. apis. We conclude that chalkbrood does not develop from a temperature- or treatment-induced activation of A. apis. Sugar syrups, miticides, and antibiotics point out other health problems that make bees prone to infection by A. apis. Thus, chalkbrood opportunistically infects bees under other forms of stress...|$|R

50|$|He {{began his}} {{research}} using maltose <b>syrups</b> (<b>corn</b> <b>syrups)</b> {{mixed with a}} small amount of water. He then tested shear stress versus shear rate of the solution to prove that the solution was a Newtonian fluid. This was done by using a R16 Weissenberg rheogoniometer (a rheogoniometer calibrated to measure specifically the behavior of a viscoelastic polymer solution) for the low range shear stress rates, and the high rates were measured using a capillary rheometer, a device used to measure shear stress rates under high stress. The data proved that there was a linear relationship between shear stress and shear rate with the slope being very close to one, meaning the maltose syrup was indeed a Newtonian fluid. Once 0.08% of the polymer polyacrylamide was added, the flow properties drastically changed. Elastic properties were introduced to the fluid while only a slight amount of shear thinning was observed, small enough to be ignored. The syrup solution had properties very similar to a polymer melt, but there was no shear thinning and the materials could be produced at room temperature.|$|R

30|$|Glucoamylase (EC 3.2. 1.3) is a hydrolytic {{enzyme that}} degrades starch and related oligosaccharides, {{leading to the}} {{production}} of β-d-glucose. Other sectors that benefit from glucoamylase include brewing, textile, food, paper, and pharmaceutical industries [1]. Glucoamylase is sourced from different microbial specimens like bacteria, yeasts, and fungi. The commercial production of glucoamylase has been mainly carried out using the genera Aspergillus and Rhizopus [2]. For the manufacture of high-fructose <b>corn</b> <b>syrups,</b> starch needs to be first converted to glucose by high-temperature liquefaction and saccharification [3]. A lot of focus is currently made on the high thermostability of glucoamylase used in the starch processing. Hence, a highly thermostable and environmentally compatible glucoamylase is very essential for industrial purposes [4]. The main benefits of using thermostable enzymes in the starch processing industry include increased reaction rates, decreased contamination risk and cost-reduction in terms of cooling system [5, 6]. The thermophilic fungus, Humicola grisea possesses an efficient hydrolytic system for the production of glucoamylase. Moreover, the enzyme is stable when exposed to high temperature for a longer duration. With regard to these advantages, glucoamylase derived from the thermophilic fungus, H. grisea MTCC 352 has been used in the current study [3].|$|R

Compared to the C-G group, the C-F mice consumed more food and less water, and gained more weight. The blood glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels were {{higher in the}} C-F than in the C-G mice. Thymoma implantation into the right flank caused a transient decrease in body weight followed by a steady increase due to tumour growth. Tumours were detected earlier and tumour size was the T-G mice. Tumour chemical composition was similar in both groups. greater in the T-F group than in Blood analysis showed that the T mice had lower glucose and higher insulin and triglyceride levels than the C group. Carcasses from the T groups contained more water and ash and less fat than their C counterparts, but the type of sugar did not affect the body composition of the C or T groups. The results suggest that dietary fructose may enhance the growth of tumour via its hyperinsulinaemic action.
