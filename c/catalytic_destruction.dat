40|$|The <b>catalytic</b> <b>destruction</b> {{of ethanol}} (0. 5 % v/v) over a typical {{three-way}} catalyst (Pt/Rh/Ce) and two base catalysts (1 % CuO and 10 % CuO on gamma-Al 2 O 3) was studied {{in a continuous}} flow reactor, under atmospheric pressure. The effect of the temperature (100 - 500 degreesC) and of the oxygen concentration (0 - 10 % v/v) on {{the operation of the}} tested catalysts and on the product profiles is presented. The formation of acetaldehyde during the <b>catalytic</b> <b>destruction</b> of ethanol, the main concern of ethanol addition to fuels, was extremely dependent on the oxygen concentration. It is noteworthy that more acetaldehyde was produced during the oxidation of ethanol in oxygen deficit conditions than during its decomposition in the absence of oxygen.

40|$|When {{the output}} of a complex {{chemical}} model is analysed, a typical topic is the determination of pathways, i. e. reaction sequences, that produce or destroy a chemical species of interest. A representative example is the investigation of <b>catalytic</b> ozone <b>destruction</b> cycles in the stratosphere. An algorithm for the automatic determination of pathways in any given reaction system is presented. Under the assumption that reaction rates are known, it finds all significant pathways, i. e. all pathways with a rate above a prescribed threshold. The algorithm forms pathways step by step, starting from single reactions. The chemical species in the system are consecutively considered as `branching points'. For every branching-point species, each pathway producing it is connected with each pathway consuming it. Rates proportional to `branching probabilities' are calculated. Pathways with a rate that is smaller than a prescribed threshold are discarded. If a newly formed pathway contains sub-pathways, e. g. null cycles, it is split into these simpler pathways. In order to demonstrate {{the performance of the}} algorithm, it has been applied to the determination of <b>catalytic</b> ozone <b>destruction</b> cycles and methane oxidation pathways in the stratosphere...|$|R

Large NO 2 enhancements in the polar winter mesosphere have been previously reported by several authors and have been attributed to NO production by solar proton or by energetic electron precipitations. The simultaneous occurrence of an intense mesospheric warming observed by the SABER/ TIMED instrument indicates that a strong air descent occurred in the polar region, transporting a large quantity of NO from the upper mesosphere-lower thermosphere to the lower mesosphere.

40|$|Solar cycle 23 was {{accompanied}} by eight very large solar proton events (SPEs) between 2000 and 2005, along with numerous smaller events. The very large SPE in July 2000, which {{was associated with the}} well-known 'Bastille Day Solar Storm,' caused very substantial changes in the polar mesosphere and stratosphere. Significant downward transport of the SPE-produced NO(x) from the polar lower mesosphere and upper stratosphere during the Southern Hemisphere winter period resulted in huge enhancements (> 100 %) in middle stratospheric NO(x) (NO+NO 2) during September 2000 in the polar vortex, which were measured by UARS HALOE (C. E. Randall et al., Geophys. Res. Lett., 28, 2385 - 2388, 2001). We have used the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) to study the longer-term impact of the July 2000 SPE, the third largest SPE period in the past 40 years. This very large SPE provided a wonderful opportunity to study the downward transport of energetic particle precipitation effects in the middle atmosphere. Not surprisingly, the WACCM-simulated polar Northern Hemisphere influences from the July (mid-summer) 2000 SPE were significant for a few months, but the constituent changes were not transported below about 20 hPa. However in the polar Southern Hemisphere (SH) region, the persistent downward transport in the vortex during the months of July-August-September resulted in significant modeled influences for about a year past the SPE. The SH odd nitrogen family, NO(y) (N, NO, NO 2, NO 3, N 2 O 5, HNO 3, HO 2 NO 2, ClONO 2, BrONO 2), was greatly enhanced by this SPE and these increases were transported to the lower stratosphere. The SPE-enhanced polar NO(y) resulted in long-lasting ozone decreases (from <b>catalytic</b> NO(y) <b>destruction</b> of ozone) and ozone increases (from NO(y) interference in the chlorine and bromine <b>catalytic</b> ozone <b>destruction</b> cycles). These ozone changes resulted in simulated SH polar stratospheric temperature decreases (1 - 2 K) and increases (1 - 3 K). ...|$|R

40|$|In a study {{concerning}} Antarctic ozone depletion, {{reactions of}} dinitrogen pentoxide {{with water and}} hydrochloric acid were studied on ice surfaces in a Knudsen cell flow reactor. The N 2 O 5 reacted on ice at 185 K to form condensed-phase nitric acid (HNO 3). This reaction may provide a sink for odd nitrogen, NO(x), during the polar winter, a requirement in nearly all models of Antarctic ozone depletion. The reaction of N 2 O 5 on HCl-ice surfaces at 185 K produced gaseous nitryl chloride (ClNO 2) and condensed-phase HNO 3 and proceeded until all of the HCl within the ice was depleted.

40|$|The {{question}} of midlatitude ozone erosion by chlorine free radical catalysis is examined. We present and analyze simultaneous, high-resolution observations of ClO, H 2 O, tropopause height, particle reactive surface area, and ice saturation occurrence frequency {{obtained from the}} NASA ER- 2 aircraft. The objective is {{to test the hypothesis}} that the existence of cirrus clouds or cold aerosols in the first few kilometers above the tropopause at midlatitudes is responsible for increasing the ratio of chlorine free radicals to total inorganic chlorine, thus amplifying the rate of <b>catalytic</b> ozone <b>destruction.</b> The observations reveal a sharp decrease in ice saturation frequency at the tropopause, a marked degree of undersaturation just above the tropopause, a corresponding sharp gradient in the product of cold aerosol reactive surface area and reaction probability, gamma-S(sub a), and, finally, the consistent absence of enhanced concentrations of ClO immediately above the tropopause.

40|$|The {{chemistry}} of Cl sub 2 O sub 2, the chlorine monoxide dimer, has been further investigated {{in order to}} better asses its potential role in <b>catalytic</b> ozone <b>destruction</b> cycles. The dimer has been generated in a flow system, in the 200 to 250 K temperature range, by using ozone and chlorine atoms as ClO precursors. The Cl-atoms are produced by a microwave discharge of either Cl sub 2, or of F sub 2 with subsequent addition of HCl. With this later scheme the dimer can be generated in the absence of Cl sub 2. The Fourier transform infrared spectra of the products clearly indicates the presence of two isomers, in agreement with earlier results (J. Phys. Shen., 91, 433, 1987). None of the observed IR bands can be attributed to a ClO-OClO adduct, since they all appear {{in the absence of any}} detectable amount of OCl. It is likely that the particles in the polar stratospheric clouds will have a relatively dilute nitric acid outer layer, even if the core is the nitric acid monohydrate, since the particles are in equilibrium with the ambient water vapor, which is present at levels of a few parts per million...|$|R

Rate constants were measured under pseudo-first-order conditions in separate experiments with first HO_ 2 and then BrO in excess in an effort to identify possible complications in the reaction conditions.

40|$|International audienceOnly recently, ground- and satellite-based {{measurements}} {{have reported}} {{high concentrations of}} IO in coastal Antarctica. The sources of such a large iodine burden in the Antarctic atmosphere remain unknown. We propose a novel mechanism for iodine release from sea-ice surfaces. The release is triggered by the biological production of iodide (I -) and hypoiodous acid (HOI) from marine algae, contained within and underneath sea-ice, and their diffusion through sea-ice brine channels to accumulate in the quasi-liquid layer {{on the surface of}} sea-ice. A multiphase chemical model of polar atmospheric chemistry has been developed to investigate the biology-ice-atmosphere coupling in the polar environment. Model simulations were conducted to interpret recent observations of elevated IO in the coastal Antarctic springtime. The results show that the levels of inorganic iodine (i. e. I 2, IBr, ICl) released from sea-ice through this mechanism account for the observed IO concentrations in the Antarctic springtime environment. The model results also indicate that iodine may trigger the catalytic release of bromine from sea-ice through phase equilibration of IBr. Considering the extent of sea-ice around the Antarctic continent, we suggest that the resulting high levels of iodine may have widespread impact on <b>catalytic</b> ozone <b>destruction</b> and aerosol formation in the Antarctic lower troposphere...|$|R

40|$|The {{chemical}} processes in daytime sprite streamers in the altitude range of 30 – 54 km are investigated {{by means of}} a detailed ion–neutral chemistry model (without consideration of transport). The focus lies on nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen species, and in particular on ozone perturbations. Initial effects of the breakdown electric fields at the tip of sprite streamers include a short-term loss of ozone due to ion–chemical reactions, a production of nitrogen radicals, and a liberation of atomic oxygen. The latter leads to a formation of ozone. In terms of relative ozone change, this effect decreases with altitude. The model results indicate that the subsequent ozone perturbations due to daytime sprites streamers differ considerably from the ones of night-time events. For night-time conditions, reactive nitrogen produced at the streamer heads is rapidly converted into significantly less reactive NO 2, and there is basically no ozone depletion. The situation is different for daytime conditions where NO x causes <b>catalytic</b> ozone <b>destruction.</b> As a consequence, there is significant ozone loss in sprite streamers in the daytime atmosphere, in particular at higher altitudes.

While the tropical oceans are a known source of these very short lived substances (VSLS), including e. g. bromoform (CHBr 3) and methyliodide (CH 3 I), the tropical Western Pacific waters are largely uncharacterized for these compounds. Coastal macro algae, regionally enhanced phytoplankton abundance, photochemical reactions and local anthropogenic sources are expected to contribute to strong marine emissions. As high convective activity with fast efficient uplift takes place throughout the year, the western Pacific is projected to be a hot spot for oceanic VSLS supply to the stratosphere. In this study, we present first results from the SHIVA Sonne expedition to the South China Sea during November 2011. The research cruise was embedded within the framework of the EU-project SHIVA (Stratospheric ozone: Halogen Impacts in a Varying Atmosphere).

The main objective of this work is investigation of <b>catalytic</b> tar <b>destruction</b> in order to evaluate two selected catalysts, namely dolomite, available in Lithuanian as natural resource, and char derived from pyrolysis of used tires. The effi-ciency of these catalysts were investigated as an ability to decompose tar hydrocarbons at high temperatures and op-timal process conditions were determined, which are base starting point for developing new functional material and technological solutions. Results of catalytic steam reforming of two main tar compounds from biomass gasification – benzene and naphtha-lene – are presented in this article.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{halogenated}} substances {{cause the}} ozone hole above Antarctica through <b>catalytic</b> ozone <b>destruction</b> and {{depletion of the}} stratospheric ozone layer, which shields the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Their emissions were regulated through the Montreal Protocol in 1989. Since {{the beginning of the}} 21 st century, the amount of chlorine and bromine in the stratosphere from long-lived ozone depleting substances (ODS) has been decreasing and stratospheric ozone has started to increase slowly. Under these circumstances the importance of natural halogenated substances for atmospheric composition and chemistry will increase in the future. Trace-gases with atmospheric lifetimes of less than half a year belong to the so-called very short-lived substances(VSLS). The most important bromine containing VSLS bromoform (CHBr 3, 17 days lifetime) and dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2, 150 days) from marine sources currently contribute about 25 % to the observed stratospheric bromine loading. In addition, the short-lived VSLS methyl iodide (CH 3 I, 3. 5 days) contributes to stratospheric iodine levels. Sulfur containing compounds, such as dimethylsulfide (DMS, 1 day), also influence stratospheric ozone. Sulfur supplies the stratospheric aerosol layer, which amplifies heterogeneous chemical ozone depleting reactions under high chlorine levels. DMS is a potential source of sulfur to the stratosphere. VSLS are naturally produced in the oceans by phytoplankton, macro algae, and photochemistry. They are primarily transported to the stratosphere with deep convection in the tropics and mainly enter the stratosphere over the Pacific warm pool in boreal winter and the Asian monsoon region in boreal summer. Major uncertainties still exist with respect to the oceanic emissions of halogenated VSLS from the Indian Ocean and their stratospheric entrainment through the Asian monsoon circulation.
