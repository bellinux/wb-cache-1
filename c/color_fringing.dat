40|$|This paper {{presents}} a 3 D small-field imaging system {{by using the}} <b>color</b> <b>fringe</b> projection technique to measure the small objects having large slopes and/or discontinuous surface. A stereo microscope is used to generate a small-field projecting field and to capture the deformed fringe patterns on the measured small objects, respectively. Three fringe sets having the optimum fringe numbers are coded into one major color channel to generate <b>color</b> <b>fringe</b> patterns having the maximum fringe contrast of the captured fringe images. Through one channel of the stereo microscope, a DLP (Digital Light Processing) projector projects these generated <b>color</b> <b>fringe</b> pattern images onto the measured objects surface. From another channel, the fringe patterns are deformed {{with regard to the}} object surface and captured by a color CCD camera. The absolute phase of each pixel can be calculated from the captured fringe patterns by using the optimum three-fringe numbers selection method. Experimental results on measuring 3 D shape of small objects show the accuracy and availability of the developed 3 D imaging system...|$|R

50|$|In 2015 {{a refined}} version used an {{achromatic}} metasurface to focus different wavelengths of {{light at the}} same point, employing a dielectric material rather than a metal. This improves efficiency and can produce a consistent effect by focusing red, blue and green wavelengths {{at the same point}} to achieve instant color correction, yielding a color image. The new flat lens does not suffer from the chromatic aberrations, or <b>color</b> <b>fringing,</b> that plague refractive lenses. As such, it will not require the additional bulky lens elements traditionally used to compensate for this chromatic dispersion.|$|E

5000|$|Color {{printing}} adds complexity to {{the printing}} process because very slight misalignments known as registration errors can occur between printing each color, causing unintended <b>color</b> <b>fringing,</b> blurring, or light/dark streaking {{along the edges}} of colored regions. To permit a high registration accuracy, some color laser printers use a large rotating belt called a [...] "transfer belt". The transfer belt passes in front of all the toner cartridges and each of the toner layers are precisely applied to the belt. The combined layers are then applied to the paper in a uniform single step.|$|E
50|$|The Vidster is {{appreciated}} for {{the unique}} aesthetic {{properties of the}} video footage it records. Since the M-JPEG video created by the Vidster is so highly compressed, the footage exhibits constantly visible macroblocks, or square blocky artifacts from encoding. The Vidster only has auto-exposure {{as a method of}} exposure control, and also is constantly automatically white-balancing itself. This leads to very accentuated alterations in the qualities of the image, even from small changes in a scene. The lens of the Vidster is extremely small, resulting in an image with slight vignetting of image sharpness. There is also significant <b>color</b> <b>fringing</b> and video noise, especially for low-light subjects.|$|E

5000|$|Radial {{distortion}} {{that depends}} on wavelength is called [...] "lateral chromatic aberration" [...] - [...] "lateral" [...] because radial, [...] "chromatic" [...] because dependent on color (wavelength). This can cause <b>colored</b> <b>fringes</b> in high-contrast areas in the outer parts of the image. This {{should not be confused}} with axial (longitudinal) chromatic aberration, which causes aberrations throughout the field, particularly purple fringing.|$|R
50|$|For {{people with}} a high degree of myopia, very strong eyeglass {{prescriptions}} are needed to correct the focus error. However, strong eyeglass prescriptions have a negative side effect in that off-axis viewing of objects, away from the center of the lens, results in prismatic movement and separation of colors, known as chromatic aberration. This prismatic distortion is visible to the wearer as color fringes around strongly contrasting colors. The fringes move around as the wearer's gaze through the lenses changes, and the prismatic shifting reverses on either side, above, and below the exact center of the lenses. <b>Color</b> <b>fringing</b> can make accurate drawing and painting difficult for users of strong eyeglass prescriptions.|$|E
5000|$|Convergence is {{the process}} of {{controlling}} the CRT beam deflection to keep the red, green and blue beams properly overlapped when scanning the raster (area illuminated by the scan lines on a CRT). As the electron gun scans across the screen, the shape of electron beams slightly varies as the beam reaches the outer edges of the screen. Misconvergence, the technical term used when this process is not completely accurate, appears as <b>color</b> <b>fringing</b> on the edge of an image displayed on the screen. For example, a CRT monitor with misaligned electron beams will show a white [...] "H" [...] on a black background with one of the primary or secondary colors shadowing its edges. Cromaclear provides deterrents to misconvergence, including the ELA guns and their tight mask pitch.|$|E
5000|$|In practice, {{a change}} from 30 to 32 Abbe {{will not have a}} {{practically}} noticeable benefit, but {{a change from}} 30 to 47 could be beneficial for users with strong prescriptions that move their eyes and look [...] "off-axis" [...] of optical center of the lens. Note that some users do not sense <b>color</b> <b>fringing</b> directly but will just describe [...] "off-axis blurriness".Abbe values even as high as that of (Vd≤45) produce chromatic aberrations which can be perceptible to a user in lenses larger than 40 mm in diameter and especially in strengths that are in excess of ±4D. At ±8D even glass (Vd≤58) produces chromatic aberration that can be noticed by a user. Chromatic aberration is independent of the lens being of spherical, aspheric, or atoric design.|$|E

2500|$|Similar <b>colored</b> <b>fringing</b> around {{highlights}} {{may also}} be caused by lens flare. <b>Colored</b> <b>fringing</b> around highlights or dark regions {{may be due to}} the receptors for different colors having differing dynamic range or sensitivity – therefore preserving detail in one or two color channels, while [...] "blowing out" [...] or failing to register, in the other channel or channels. On digital cameras, the particular demosaicing algorithm is likely to affect the apparent degree of this problem. Another cause of this fringing is chromatic aberration in the very small microlenses used to collect more light for each CCD pixel; since these lenses are tuned to correctly focus green light, the incorrect focusing of red and blue results in purple fringing around highlights. This is a uniform problem across the frame, and is more of a problem in CCDs with a very small pixel pitch such as those used in compact cameras. Some cameras, such as the Panasonic Lumix series and newer Nikon and Sony DSLRs, feature a processing step specifically designed to remove it.|$|R
50|$|Eyeglasses {{sometimes}} have unwanted effects including magnification or reduction, distortion, <b>color</b> <b>fringes,</b> altered depth perception, etc. Although {{many people think}} of lenses as magnifiers, the lenses within eyeglasses improve vision primarily by reducing blur.

Often, magnifiers are part of a regimen prescribed by low vision optometrists to help people with reduced vision.|$|R
5000|$|... 1975: E. Leitz APO-Telyt-R 180mm f/3.4 (West Germany): first {{apochromatic lens}} for {{consumer}} cameras (Leicaflex series SLRs). The refractive index of glass increases from red to {{blue of the}} light spectrum (color dispersion). Blue is focused closer to the lens than red causing rainbow-like <b>color</b> <b>fringing</b> (chromatic aberration). Most photographic camera lenses are achromatically corrected to bring blue and red to a common focus - leaving large residual green and violet chromatic aberrations that degrades image sharpness; especially severe in long focus or telephoto lenses. If red, green and blue are brought to a common focus (plus other aberration corrections) with very little residual aberration, the lens is called apochromatic. Chromatic aberration was an issue {{at the dawn of}} photography (daguerreotypes 1839 were blue sensitive only, while the human eye focused primarily using yellow), but apochromatic photographic lenses were considered unnecessary until the dominance of color film. The use of extra-low dispersion glasses made most 1980s professional telephotos and many 1990s amateur telephoto zooms apochromatic.|$|E

5000|$|Chromatic {{aberration}} is {{the phenomenon}} of different colors focusing at different distances from a lens. In photography, chromatic aberration produces soft overall images, and <b>color</b> <b>fringing</b> at high-contrast edges, like an edge between black and white. Astronomers face similar problems, particularly with telescopes that use lenses rather than mirrors. Achromatic lenses are corrected to bring two wavelengths (typically red and blue) into focus in the same plane. Apochromatic lenses are designed to bring three wavelengths (typically red, green, and blue) into focus in the same plane. The residual color error (secondary spectrum) can be up to {{an order of magnitude}} less than for an achromatic lens of equivalent aperture and focal length. Apochromats are also corrected for spherical aberration at two wavelengths, rather than one as in an achromat.Telescope objective lenses for wide-band digital imaging in astronomy must have apochromatic correction, as the optical sensitivity of typical CCD imaging arrays can extend from the ultraviolet through the visible spectrum and into the near infrared wavelength range. Apochromatic lenses for astrophotography in the 60-150 mm aperture range have been developed and marketed by several different firms, with focal ratios ranging from [...] to 7. Focused and guided properly during the exposure, these apochromatic objectives are capable of producing the sharpest wide-field astrophotographs optically possible for the given aperture sizes.|$|E

40|$|Single-chip color DLP {{projectors}} {{show the}} red, {{green and blue}} components one after another. When the gaze moves relative to the displayed pixels, <b>color</b> <b>fringes</b> are perceived. In order to reduce these artefacts, many devices show the same input image twice at the double rate, i. e. a 60 Hz source image is displayed with 120 Hz. Consumer stereo projectors usually work with time interlaced stereo, allowing to address each of these two images individually. We use this so called 3 D mode for mono image display of fast moving objects. Additionally, we generate a separate image for each individual color, taking the display time offset of each color component into account. With these 360 images per second we can strongly reduce ghosting, <b>color</b> <b>fringes</b> and jitter artefacts on fast moving objects tracked by the eye, resulting in sharp objects with smooth motion. Real-time image generation at such a high frame rate can only be achieved for simple scenes or may only be possible by severely reducing quality. We show how to modify a motion blur post processing shader to render only 60 frames=second and efficiently generate good approximations of the missing frames...|$|R
5000|$|Chronochrome's color {{quality was}} impressive, as {{surviving}} specimens attest, {{and because the}} three frames were exposed and projected simultaneously, Kinemacolor's color bombardment and <b>color</b> <b>fringes</b> around moving objects were avoided. However, because the camera's three lenses could not all photograph the scene from exactly the same viewpoint, subjects that were too near the camera would exhibit <b>color</b> <b>fringes</b> if the registration of the three projected images was optimized for {{the background of the}} scene, and vice versa. A method of notching the prints to trigger automatic adjustment of the projection optics was invented, but expert supervision of the presentation was still a requisite. Light loss due to the color filters and the constrained dimensions of the projection lenses resulted in an image that was too dim for showing in a large auditorium unless a highly reflective metalized screen or rear-projection onto a translucent screen was used, and either solution created a [...] "hot spot" [...] that made the views from the side sections of the auditorium very unsatisfactory. The films were seldom screened outside of Gaumont's own cinemas and the system soon fell into disuse.|$|R
