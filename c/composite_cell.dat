40|$|Abstract — A {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{to determine the}} average cel-lular geometry in high-resolution images of embryonic epithelia. The concept of a ‘composite cell ’ is used to represent the average cell shape. This <b>composite</b> <b>cell</b> can provide evidence of stresses present in the epithelia. A new adaptive contrast enhancement routine {{is applied to the}} input image first, followed by an iterative watershed segmentation. The <b>composite</b> <b>cell</b> is calculated from the segmentation results. Qualitative results show that this computationally inexpensive algorithm produces accurate results for a variety of image sizes, contrast levels, cell shapes and appearances.

40|$|A {{hybrid cell}} sheet {{engineering}} approach was developed using ultra-thin nanofiber arrays {{to host the}} formation of composite nanofiber/cell sheets. It was found that confluent aligned cell sheets could grow on uniaxially-aligned and crisscrossed nanofiber arrays with extremely low fiber densities. The porosity of the nanofiber sheets was sufficient to allow aligned linear myotube formation from differentiated myoblasts {{on both sides of}} the nanofiber sheets, in spite of single-side cell seeding. The nanofiber content of the <b>composite</b> <b>cell</b> sheets is minimized to reduce the hindrance to cell migration, cell-cell contacts, mass transport, as well as the foreign body response or inflammatory response associated with the biomaterial. Even at extremely low densities, the nanofiber component significantly enhanced the stability and mechanical properties of the <b>composite</b> <b>cell</b> sheets. In addition, the aligned nanofiber arrays imparted excellent handling properties to the <b>composite</b> <b>cell</b> sheets, which allowed easy processing into more complex, thick 3 D structures of higher hierarchy. Aligned nanofiber array-based <b>composite</b> <b>cell</b> sheet engineering combines several advantages of material-free cell sheet engineering and polymer scaffold-based cell sheet engineering; and it represents a new direction in aligned cell sheet engineering for a multitude of tissue engineering applications...|$|E

In the paper, characteristic of anisotropic transverse thermal conductivity of unidirectional natural hemp fiber bundle was numerically studied to determine the dependence of overall thermal property of the fiber bundle on that of the solid region phase. In order to efficiently predict its thermal property, the fiber bundle was embedded into an imaginary matrix to form a unit <b>composite</b> <b>cell</b> consisting of the matrix and the fiber bundle.

40|$|Abstract Background Mixed (<b>composite)</b> exocrine-neuroendocrine <b>cell</b> carcinomas {{are defined}} as an {{intimate}} admixture of neoplastic glandular exocrine and neuroendocrine cell types. Although gastric adenocarcinoma containing {{a small number of}} neuroendocrine cells is a relatively frequent occurrence, gastric neoplasms containing equal proportions of both cell types are rare. Case Presentation We present a case of <b>composite</b> exocrine (signet-ring <b>cell)</b> -neuroendocrine cell carcinoma, in which the neoplastic signet-ring cell exocrine and neuroendocrine constituents occurred in fairly equivalent amounts, whereas only the neuroendocrine carcinoma portion of the tumor represented the metastatic component.

Conclusion This study confirms the ability of pluripotent precursor cells to differentiate into either adenocarcinoma or neuroendocrine tumor and, justifying the designation of <b>composite</b> exocrine-neuroendocrine <b>cell</b> carcinoma as the appropriate classification for this tumor. The protracted clinical course further supports the notion that composite signet-ring cell/neuroendocrine carcinoma tumors behave relatively less aggressively than the pure forms of the former cell type. </p...|$|R

Methods: The simplex and graded HA/ZrO 2 compo-sites were prepared using dry-laid method. The surface to-pography of the composites was observed by {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM). The MSCs were isolated from rabbits and cultured on experimental groups (simplex HA/ ZrO 2 composite, graded HA/ZrO 2 composite, pure HA or pure ZrO 2 coatings respectively) and control group (ordinary culture plate).

Results: The SEM images confirmed that {{the surface of the}} simplex HA/ZrO 2 composite was coverd by discon-tiguous HA layer with clear visualization of the partial ZrO 2 matrix, while the surface of the graded HA/ZrO 2 composite was fairly rough with porosity. X-ray diffraction showed that after high temperature sintering, the ZrO 2 phase still remained, while the HA phase was transformed to β-Ca 3 (PO 4) 2, α-Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 and CaZrO 3 phases on the surface of both <b>composites.</b> <b>Cell</b> culture indicated that the HA/ ZrO 2 <b>composites</b> supported <b>cell</b> attachment.
