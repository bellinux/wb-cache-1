These drills have the helical flutes for <b>chips</b> <b>removal</b> with a special shape in order to allow an easy elimination of the chips. The designer gives the shape of the helical flute as sum of points, with a certain density, which describes the complex shape in a cross section on the axis of the cylindrical part.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, the {{wireline}} robot has received increasing attention {{due to the}} advantages of light weight, low cost, and flexibility compared to the traditional drilling instruments in space missions. For the lunar subsurface in situ exploration mission, we proposed a type of wireline robot named IBR (Inchworm Boring Robot) drawing inspiration from the inchworm. Two auger tools are utilized to remove chips for IBR, which directly interacted with the lunar regolith in the drilling process. Therefore, for obtaining the tools drilling characteristics, the <b>chips</b> <b>removal</b> principle of IBR is analyzed and its drilling load model is further established based on the soil mechanical theory in this paper.

40|$|Rational {{composting}} {{process control}} involves the interrelated factors of heat output, temperature, ventilation, and water removal. The heat is released microbially {{at the expense}} of organic material; temperature is an effect and, because it is a determinant of microbial activity, it is also a cause of heat output; ventilation supplies oxygen and removes heat, mainly through the vaporization of water; water removal results from heat removal. These relationships were implemented in a field-scale process of static-pile configuration, using a mixture of sewage sludge and wood <b>chips.</b> Heat <b>removal</b> was matched to heat output through a temperature feedback control system, thereby maintaining biologically favorable temperatures. The observations indicate that fundamentally {{there are two kinds of}} composting systems: those that are and those that are not temperature self-limiting. The self-limiting system reaches inhibitive temperatures (> 60 °C) which debilitate the microbial community, suppressing decomposition, heat output, and water removal.

40|$|Titanium has a {{wide variety}} of applications, {{particularly}} in the aerospace industry. However, because of its low thermal conductivity and high strength, machining of titanium is very difficult. The heat generated in machining can dramatically shorten the tool life. Rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) is a non-traditional machining process, and has been used to machine various difficult-to-machine materials. Investigations have been reported regarding effects of machining variables (including ultrasonic power, tool rotation speed, and feedrate) on several output variables in RUM, such as cutting force, torque, surface roughness, edge <b>chipping,</b> material <b>removal</b> rate, and tool wear. However, there have been few studies on cutting temperatures in RUM. This paper presents an experimental study on cutting temperature in RUM of titanium.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{understand}} surface morphology and fracture occurring on leucite-reinforced glass ceramic surfaces adjusted with coarse diamond burs. The surface roughness was quantitatively assessed using stylus profilometry and was analyzed statistically. The surface morphology was viewed using scanning electron microscopy. Surface phase transformations were preliminarily studied using Raman spectrometry. The results show that the surface roughness did not significantly depend on either depth of cut (p > 0. 05) or feed rate (p > 0. 05). However, when decreasing the depth of cut and the feed rate, a tendency for brittle-to-ductile transition existed. The surface morphology consisted of microfracture, <b>chipping,</b> ductile <b>removal</b> scratches, smear areas and debris. Brittle fracture was the primary mechanism for material removal. Lateral and radial cracks due to the mechanical impact of diamond burs were the major cause of surface fracture in the leucite-reinforced glass ceramic. The maximum adjusting temperatures on the adjusted surfaces were estimated based on heat transfer analysis. The Raman spectra of the adjusted and unadjusted surfaces show a strong temperature-dependence of Raman shifts near 525 – 529 cm− 1. This indicates the occurrence of temperature-induced cubic-tetragonal phase transformations in the adjusted leucite glass ceramic surfaces. These phase transformations are considered to contribute crack initiation and propagation on the adjusted surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Removal of anti-A/B {{antibodies}} from {{blood in}} the peri-transplantation period eliminates the risk of hyperacute rejection in ABO-incompatible transplantation. We are developing anti-A/B immunoadsorption devices, compatible with whole blood perfusion. In this study we developed a new antibody filtering device based on integrated microfiltration fibers with antibody capturing beads distributed within the interstitial fiber space (BSAF device). As blood flows through the fibers in BSAF devices, Starling flow carries plasma from the inner fiber lumen to the beads in the shell compartment where antibodies diffuse and bind to covalently attached antigens within the shell-side porous beads. We first investigated {{the possibility of using}} synthetic blood group A/B-trisaccharide epitopes, conjugated with poly-N hydroxyethylacrylamide spacers, as the immunoadsorbent material in our antibody filtering devices. The glycopolymers were equipped with biotin tags and deposited on streptavidin-coated sensor <b>chips.</b> Antibody <b>removal</b> capacity per unit surface area and kinetics of antibody binding to immobilized glycoconjugates were quantified using surface plasmon resonance. We then developed a simple mathematical model to guide the choice of key design and operational parameters for a clinical BSAF device. The model demonstrated that for a given flow rate and reservoir volume, antibody removal rate in a BSAF was dependent on the magnitude of a lumped dimensionless parameter which characterized the ratio of antibody uptake rate by the beads to the Starling flow rate in the device. The highest antibody removal rate was predicted for a perfusion limited regime. Once this maximum limit was obtained, any further increase in the antibody removal rate was only possible by increasing the flow rate in the device. Key model predictions were validated in a series of in vitro monoclonal anti-A antibody capture studies in BSAF devices packed with anti-A specific beads. Once validated, we used the model to design a BSAF device that would generate a clinically relevant rate of anti-A removal. We fabricated and tested scaled down prototypes of the "clinical" BSAF device and showed significant reduction in IgM and IgG anti-A antibody titers within two hours of whole blood perfusion through our fabricated BSAF devices...|$|R

The model simultaneously captures the atomistic mechanisms during material removal from the free surface and the long-range mobility of dislocations and their interactions without the computational cost of full atomistic simulations. The method also permits the simulation of system sizes that are approaching experimentally accessibly systems, albeit in 2 D. Simulations are performed on single crystal aluminum to study the atomistic details of material <b>removal,</b> <b>chip</b> formation, surface evolution, and generation and propagation of dislocations {{for a wide range of}} tool speeds (20 - 800 ?m/s) at room temperature. The results from these simulations demonstrate the power of the developed method in capturing both long-range dislocation plasticity and short-range atomistic phenomena during tool advance. In addition, we have investigated the effect of the scratching depth during the material removal process. Fluctuations of scratching tangential force are related to dislocation generation events during the material removal process. A transition from dislocation generation and glides at lower tool speeds to localized amorphization at high tool speeds is found to give rise to an optimal tool speed for low cutting forces.

40|$|AbstractIt is a {{challenging}} task to avoid ploughing effects in micro-milling. When one tooth of {{the cutting tool}} crosses the minimum chip thickness boundary, the tool would enter into the ploughing zone with no chip formation. Therefore, it is significant to predict the ploughing volume and forces in micro-milling. In this work, the ploughing mechanism for micro-milling is proposed by considering the minimum chip thickness effects. A 3 D chip geometry is developed to calculate chip thickness, ploughing volume and ploughing forces in micro 5 -axis flat-end milling with a flat-end mill. The local parallel sliced tool based method is then applied to get cutter-workpiece engagement domain where the cutting flutes entry and exit the workpiece, minimum chip thickness and depth of cut are required to predict ploughing forces. Local parallel sliced method divides the cutting tool into several slices that are perpendicular to the tool axis along the local coordinate system. On each layer, the <b>removal</b> <b>chip</b> area is dividing into ploughing zone and shearing zone by the minimum chip thickness. Ploughing zone is the area as chip thickness {{is less than the}} minimum chip thickness. In the shearing zone, chip thickness is larger than the minimum chip thickness.
