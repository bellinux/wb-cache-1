40|$|Nanostructured <b>colloidal</b> <b>semiconductors</b> with {{heterogeneous}} photocatalytic behavior {{have drawn}} considerable attention {{over the past}} few years. This is due to their large surface area, high redox potential of the photogenerated charge carriers, and selective reduction/oxidation of different classes of organic compounds. In the present paper, we have carried out a systematic synthesis of nanostructured CdS-TiO 2 via reverse micelle process. The structural and microstructural characterizations of the as-prepared CdS-TiO 2 nanocomposites are determined using XRD and SEM-EDS techniques.

5000|$|<b>Colloidal</b> <b>semiconductor</b> nanocrystals are {{synthesized}} from solutions, {{much like}} traditional chemical processes. The main {{difference is the}} product neither precipitates as a bulk solid nor remains dissolved. [...] Heating the solution at high temperature, the precursors decompose forming monomers which then nucleate and generate nanocrystals. Temperature is {{a critical factor in}} determining optimal conditions for the nanocrystal growth. It must be high enough to allow for rearrangement and annealing of atoms during the synthesis process while being low enough to promote crystal growth. The concentration of monomers is another critical factor that has to be stringently controlled during nanocrystal growth. The growth process of nanocrystals can occur in two different regimes, [...] "focusing" [...] and [...] "defocusing". At high monomer concentrations, the critical size (the size where nanocrystals neither grow nor shrink) is relatively small, resulting in growth of nearly all particles. In this regime, smaller particles grow faster than large ones (since larger crystals need more atoms to grow than small crystals) resulting in [...] "focusing" [...] of the size distribution to yield nearly monodisperse particles. The size focusing is optimal when the monomer concentration is kept such that the average nanocrystal size present is always slightly larger than the critical size. Over time, the monomer concentration diminishes, the critical size becomes larger than the average size present, and the distribution [...] "defocuses".There are colloidal methods to produce many different semiconductors. Typical dots are made of binary compounds such as lead sulfide, lead selenide, cadmium selenide, cadmium sulfide, indium arsenide, and indium phosphide. Dots may also be made from ternary compounds such as cadmium selenide sulfide.These quantum dots can contain as few as 100 to 100,000 atoms within the quantum dot volume, with a diameter of ~ 10 to 50 atoms. This corresponds to about 2 to 10 nanometers, and at 10 nm in diameter, nearly 3 million quantum dots could be lined up end to end and fit within the width of a human thumb.|$|E
40|$|<b>Colloidal</b> <b>semiconductor</b> nanocrystals have {{attracted}} continuous worldwide interest {{over the last}} three decades owing to their remarkable and unique size- and shape-, dependent properties. The colloidal nature of these nanomaterials allows one {{to take full advantage of}} nanoscale effects to tailor their optoelectronic and physical-chemical properties, yielding materials that combine size-, shape-, and composition-dependent properties with easy surface manipulation and solution processing. These features have turned the study of <b>colloidal</b> <b>semiconductor</b> nanocrystals into a dynamic and multidisciplinary research field, with fascinating fundamental challenges and dazzling application prospects. This review focuses on the excited-state dynamics in these intriguing nanomaterials, covering a range of different relaxation mechanisms that span over 15 orders of magnitude, from a few femtoseconds to a few seconds after photoexcitation. In addition to reviewing the state of the art and highlighting the essential concepts in the field, we also discuss the relevance of the different relaxation processes to a number of potential applications, such as photovoltaics and LEDs.

40|$|<b>Colloidal</b> <b>semiconductor</b> nanocrystals in {{the range}} 1 - 10 nm are {{promising}} building blocks for future nanodevices since they show strong quantum confinement effects even at room temperature [1, 2]. <b>Colloidal</b> <b>semiconductor</b> nanocrystals consist of an inorganic core, having the same crystal structure as the corresponding bulk semiconductor, surrounded by a shell of capping molecules. These cappping molecules have several functions. During synthesis, they limit {{the growth rate of}} the nanocrystals. This makes it possible to separate nucleation from growth, yielding monodisperse colloidal solutions. In addition, the capping prevents aggregation of the nanocrystal by steric stabilisation. After synthesis, the capping molecules determines the physical and chemical properties of the nanocrystals [2]. For instance, the capping may passivate surface states yielding nanocrystals with a high luminescence quantum yield or the capping molecules may contain functional groups that make it possible to bind nanocrystals to a substrate [3]. Capping engineering, i. e. capping a nanocrystal with molecules that give the nanocrystal a desired property, will be of importance for future work on <b>colloidal</b> <b>semiconductor</b> nanocrystals.

40|$|The charge {{injection}} {{dynamics of}} dye sensitization from a surface-bound dye (coumarin 343 (C 343)) to the conduction band (CB) of the TiO 2 is reported {{here for the}} first time. Ultrafast fluorescence dynamics demonstrate that the charge injection from the C 343 dye to the CB of the TiO 2 occurs on a time scale of ca. 200 fs. The charge injection efficiency is attributed to strong electronic coupling between the dye and TiO 2 energy levels. The results yield a rate of injection of 5 × 1012 s- 1. Photoinduced electron transfer between dyes and <b>colloidal</b> <b>semiconductors</b> plays a vital role in silver halide photography, electrophotography, and more recently in solar energy cells. Sensitizing semiconducting oxides such as TiO 2, 1, 2 SnO 2, 3 and ZnO 24 has proven an effective way to achieve electron injection for solar cells. 5 The photostability of TiO 2, combined with its ability to effectively and quickly separate charge, makes it a potentially attractive material for solar energy cells.

40|$|Incorporating nanocrystals into future {{electronic}} or optoelectronic devices {{will require}} a means of controlling charge-injection processes {{and an understanding of}} how the injected charges affect the properties of nanocrystals. We show that the optical properties of <b>colloidal</b> <b>semiconductor</b> nanocrystal quantum dots can be tuned by an electrochemical potential. The injection of electrons into the quantum-conÞned states of the nanocrystal leads to an electrochromic re-sponse, including a strong, size-tunable, midinfrared absorption corresponding to an intraband transition, a bleach of the visible interband exciton transitions, and a quench of the narrow band-edge photoluminescence.

30|$|QDs can be {{produced}} via a number of synthetic methods. These techniques have great advances in recent years, which have enabled the synthesis of monodisperse nanocrystals with good optical properties as well as different compositions and morphologies[4]. Up to now, the most successful method to prepare highly luminescent II-VI <b>colloidal</b> <b>semiconductors</b> is the organometallic synthetic route, which uses trioctylphosphine oxide and trioctylphosphine as surface ligands, {{in order to avoid}} nanocrystal growth and aggregation. Alternatively, organic metal salts such as Cd carboxylates or phosphonates can be reacted with the chalcogenide source in 1 -octadecene. However, these methods require high temperatures, and the resulting nanoparticles are insoluble in water, which makes the final product incompatible with the biological systems[5 – 7]. More recently, QDs have been prepared in aqueous medium because this synthetic approach is simpler, less toxic, and generates water-soluble nanocrystals that are directly biologically compatible[8]. Nevertheless, this method generally produces nanoparticles with lower fluorescence quantum yields, when compared to the synthesis in organic media. The lower florescence quantum yield is attributed to the defects and traps {{on the surface of the}} nanocrystals. Therefore, researchers have investigated the influence of the surface ligands so as to remove these defects and improve the optical properties[4, 9, 10].|$|R

On nanocrystalline CdSe capped with organic molecules the muons probably form states at the surface or substitute for hydrogen in the organic materials. The results obtained so far on nc-CdTe are suggestive of formation of a muonium state inside the nanocrystals, but further studies are needed to find a definitive proof...|$|R

40|$|Semiconductor {{materials}} are commonplace {{in everyday life}} and most people could not live without them. Recently, <b>colloidal</b> <b>semiconductor</b> nanocrystals have gained a lot of interest, due to the possibility to precisely tune their optoelectronic properties by tuning {{the size and shape}} of the nanocrystals. Nowadays, such <b>colloidal</b> <b>semiconductor</b> nanocrystals show potential use in applications such as television screens, solar cells and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the integration of semiconductor nanocrystals into devices is severely hindered by toxicity issues concerning the use of heavy metals such as Cd and Pb. Copper chalcogenide nanomaterials offer an interesting alternative, since they have shown to possess similar (e. g. photoluminescence), or novel (e. g. plasmonics), properties and are comprised of less toxic and more abundant elements such as Cu, Zn and Sn. Although a lot of research has been performed to obtain the same level of mastery over the synthesis of Cu-chalcogenide nanocrystals, as is currently available for Cd- and Pb-chalcogenide nanocrystals, and hence precisely tune the optoelectronic properties of colloidal Cu chalcogenide nanomaterials, there is still room for improvement. In this thesis, synthetic methodologies are discussed, that were developed to gain control over the synthesis and the optoelectronic properties of colloidal Cu-chalcogenide nanomaterials, with special emphasis on alternative synthesis approaches.

It {{is very difficult to}} obtain a controllable nucleation because the molecular bonds in III-V semiconductors are more covalent [1 – 4].

Here, we demonstrate {{the high degree}} of spectral tunability achievable through variation of the cation, metal, and halide composition as well as nanoplatelet thickness. We synthesize nanoplatelets of the form L 2 [ABX 3]n- 1 BX 4, where L is an organic ligand (octylammonium, butylammonium), A is a monovalent metal or organic molecular cation (cesium, methylammonium, formamidinium), B is a divalent metal cation (lead, tin), X is a halide anion (chloride, bromide, iodide), and n- 1 is the number of unit cells in thickness. We show that variation of n, B, and X leads to large changes in the absorption and emission energy, while variation of the A cation leads to only subtle changes but can significantly impact the nanoplatelet stability and photoluminescence quantum yield (with values over 20 %). Furthermore, mixed halide nanoplatelets exhibit continuous spectral tunability over a 1. 5 eV spectral range, from 2. 2 to 3. 7 eV. The nanoplatelets have relatively large lateral dimensions (100 nm to 1 μm), which promote self-assembly into stacked superlattice structures-the periodicity of which can be adjusted based on the nanoplatelet surface ligand length. These results demonstrate the versatility of colloidal perovskite nanoplatelets as a material platform, with tunability extending from the deep-UV, across the visible, into the near-IR. In particular, the tin-containing nanoplatelets represent a significant addition to the small but increasingly important family of lead- and cadmium-free <b>colloidal</b> <b>semiconductors...</b>|$|R
