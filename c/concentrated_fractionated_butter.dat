In conclusion, the Fr V, whose constituents were mainly condensed tannins, possessed the highest antioxidant and antiproliferative effects, and thus could be potentially applied as natural antioxidant and antiproliferative agents in both food, cosmetic, or pharmaceutical fields for health promotion...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to determine the manner in which monocytes increase mesangial matrices, particularly glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) which interact with various other matrix components such as collagens, laminin, fibronectin and lipoproteins. A supernatant of human peripheral blood monocyte cultures activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) contains stimulating factors for glycosaminoglycan synthesis in rat mesangial cells (MCs). The culture supernatant in this study was <b>concentrated</b> and <b>fractionated</b> by gel chromatography and the GAG-stimulatory factor was found to have a molecular weight of 10 - 17 kD. This factor was shown to be present in fractions different from that of IL- 1. Gel and ion-exchange chromatography studies of GAGs synthesized by MCs indicated the elution patterns of GAGs in the presence and absence of the monocyte culture supernatant to be essentially the same. Local infiltration of monocytes into the glomerulus, often seen in various types of glomerular injury, may be an important factor in the accumulation of the mesangial matrix...|$|R

The pure Brachionus calyciflorus were fed on Chlorella available in the laboratory. Algae was gradually replaced by yeast to reduce dependency on labour intensive live food. Maximum number of rotifers 413 ml - 1, was observed when they were fed on 160 : 32 yeast:algae ratio by weight combination. Ciliates and cyclops posed a major threat during culture and frequent crashes were observed due to this menace. Cyclops were selectively eradicated from the rotifer culture at 0. 09 DDVP after 20 h of exposure but not ciliates. There was no selective mortality in ciliates at any stage.

40|$|Mate {{attraction}} in Aplysia involves long-distance water-borne signaling via the secretion of the peptide pheromone attractin from the exocrine albumen gland during egg laying. Previous {{studies have shown}} that a second exocrine organ, the atrial gland, produces abundant egg-laying hormone (ELH) precursor-related peptides and mollusk-derived growth factor (MDGF), and crude extracts of the atrial gland are attractive in T-maze attraction assays. However, it is not known whether these peptides and proteins are secreted during egg laying. In this report, seawater eluates of freshly laid egg cordons were <b>concentrated</b> and <b>fractionated</b> by C 18 RP-HPLC, and the resulting major peaks were examined by amino acid compositional analysis, microsequence analysis, and electrospray mass spectrometry. Concentrated egg cordon eluates were also examined by immunoblot analysis using anti-MDGF antisera as probe. The combined data demonstrated that the atrial gland of Aplysia californica does not secrete detectable levels of either ELH precursor-related peptides or MDGF during egg laying. Although the atrial gland is the last major exocrine organ to make contact with eggs before they are laid, the gland does not appear to secrete water-borne peptide pheromones during egg laying. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are {{synthetic}} antibiotics of broad-spectrum {{antibacterial activity}} widely {{used to treat}} infections in farmed fish, turkeys, pigs, calves and poultry. Monitoring these substances residues is therefore regulated by law. For the detection of FQs, we studied the feasibility of coupling the simultaneous screening of several FQs, using a dual surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor immunoassay (BIA), in parallel, with an analytical chemical methodology for their identification. Six FQs were simultaneously screened at or below their maximum residue level (MRL) in chicken muscle using a multi-FQ BIA for norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, difloxacin and sarafloxacin, and a specific BIA for flumequine. The two BIAs were serially coupled in a multi-channel SPR biosensor featuring a dual BIA in a competitive inhibition format. The samples non-compliant during the screening with the dual BIA were further <b>concentrated</b> and <b>fractionated</b> with gradient liquid chromatography (LC). The effluent was splitted toward two 96 -well fraction collectors resulting in two identical 96 -well plates. One was re-screened with the dual BIA to identify the immunoactive fractions and direct the identification efforts toward the relevant fractions in the second well-plate with high resolution LC-electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOFMS).

The solubilized material was first applied onto an affinity chromatographic column of acetazolamide-oxirane-SepharoseR-CL- 4 B to remove contaminating cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase isozymes CA I and CA II. It was then added onto an affinity column of p-aminomethylbenzene sulfonamide coupled to CM Bio-gel AR to purify the membrane-bound carbonic anhydrase activity. This resulted in a 50 % pure enzyme. It was then <b>concentrated</b> and <b>fractionated</b> on an anion-exchange column, and desalted and purified to homogeneity (SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing) by gel filtration. The enzyme was now purified 411 -fold from extractable membrane protein. Its molecular weight was 34. 4 kDa from gel filtration and SDS-PAGE, and 36. 7 kDa from amino acid analysis. The amino acid composition differed {{from that of the}} cytoplasmic isozymes CA I, II, and III. Antisera, produced in rabbits against the purified SDS-treated enzyme, reacted with native nondenatured membrane enzyme protein but only weakly with CA II. Kinetically the enzyme was similar to CA II with respect to hydrase and esterase activities and to inhibition by various sulfonamides.

This work aimed at screening and identifying natural inhibitors of IL-induced NF-κB activation and NO production in human articular chondrocytes. Five essential oils obtained from four plants of the Iberian flora, Mentha x piperita L. (Lamiaceae), Origanum virens L. (Lamiaceae), Lavandula luiseri L. (Lamiaceae), and Juniperus oxycedrus L. subsp. oxycedrus (Cupressaceae), were screened for their ability to prevent IL- 1 -induced NO production. The oil showing higher inhibitory activity was <b>fractionated,</b> <b>concentrated,</b> analyzed for composition elucidation and prepared for further assays. For this purpose, the human chondrocytic cell line C- 28 /I 2 was used to evaluate NF-κB activation by determining the cytoplasmic levels of the total and phosphorylated forms of the inhibitory protein, IκB-α, and the NF- κB‑DNAbinding activity. The essential oil from the leaves of J. oxycedrus in a concentration of 0. 02 % (v/v) achieved the greatest inhibition (80 ± 8 %) of IL- 1 -induced NO production. Chemical analysis showed that this essential oil is predominantly composed of monoterpene hydrocabons, being α-pinene [2, 6, 6 -trimethyl-bicyclo(3. 1. 1) hept- 3 - ene] the major constituent (76 %). Similarly to the effect of the whole oil, a fraction containing 93 % α- pinene reduced significantly IL- 1 -induced IκB-α degradation.

40|$|Organic N-chloramines {{have long}} been {{recognised}} as disinfection by-products (DBPs) found in both chlorinated and chloraminated water, but have gained little attention from water authorities in the past. However, in recent years {{studies have shown that}} organic N-chloramines are molecules involved in inflammation and several chronic diseases including cancers. A recent study (Bull et al., 2006) has suggested that organic N-chloramines can be potential health risks but {{due to a lack of}} available toxicological information toxicity studies of compounds in this group have been recommended as a priority in DBPs research. The aim of this study was to investigate genotoxicity of individual organic N-chloramines utilising a mammalian cell-based genotoxicity assay to help determine which compound(s) should be subject to further in vivo studies. The flow cytometry-based micronucleus (FCMN) assay was optimised and validated for use as a rapid screening for genotoxicity of organic N-chloramine candidates. A number of assay validations were conducted on two mammalian cell lines (WIL 2 -NS and L 5178 Y) using model genotoxicants with various modes of action. Comparative studies on these two cell lines showed that WIL 2 -NS cells were suitable for the FCMN assay and therefore selected for use in all studies described in this thesis. For the genotoxicity investigation of organic N-chloramines, 16 compounds were synthesised by chlorination of amine precursors. At least 3 concentrations (in μM range) were subjected to screening for genotoxicity using the validated FCMN assay and confirmed by microscopic counting of micronuclei. This study found that of the 16 compounds, 4 were genotoxic to WIL 2 -NS cells by both FCMN and microscopy based MN assay. Oxidative stress was hypothesised as a possible genotoxic mechanism of these compounds and also was investigated in this study. Following exposure to the 4 genotoxic organic N-chloramines, it was found that although there was a small reduction of cellular glutathione the change in lipid peroxidation was not observed. This suggested that oxidative stress is unlikely to be a mechanism involved in genotoxicity of these organic N-chloramines. The final part of this research demonstrated an application of using the optimised FCMN assay to identify genotoxic DBP precursors in Australian water. We collaborated with Curtin University, Western Australia on this aspect. Highly coloured surface water was collected, <b>concentrated,</b> and <b>fractionated</b> based on molecular weight (MW) of the organic contents by researchers at Curtin University. Eight MW fractions (pre- and post chlorination) were tested for genotoxicity using the FCMN assay. No genotoxicity was observed in all pre-chlorinated MW fractions while significant genotoxicity was seen in chlorinated products of several fractions of medium to high MW. This result indicated that these fractions contain materials that are precursors to genotoxic DBPs and may lead to future studies such as characterisation of the genotoxic DBP precursors for their removal prior to the disinfection process.

40|$|The {{development}} of processes for {{the preparation of}} prebiotic compounds, namely inulin from tubers of Jerusalem artichoke (JA-Helianthus tuberosus L.), and lactulose from milk concentration permeate (MCP) was examined. Inulin was extracted from the whole JA tubers using hydrothermal extraction process, followed by clarification and concentration. The <b>concentrate</b> was <b>fractionated</b> using two different procedures i. e. ethanol fractionation and cold precipitation (+ 4 and/or - 24 C) into high- and low-molecular-weight components. The most satisfactory method was cold fractionation wherein the insoluble heavier inulin fractions were found to settle {{to the bottom and}} were separated and spray-dried to obtain inulin powder. Lactose in MCP was isomerised into lactulose using carbonate-based catalysts (oyster shell and egg shell powders) followed by clarification and concentration. Th e high-performance liquid chromatography with refractive index detector (HPLC-RID) chromatograms and changes in pH and colour values confirmed the conversion of lactose into lactulose and decomposition of lactulose into by-products. The results obtained showed the suitability of oyster shell powder for lactose isomerisation in lieu of egg shell powder. For preparing lactulose-enriched MCP with acceptable lactulose yield of 22 %, the optimum reaction conditions were found to be catalyst loading of 12 mg per mL of MCP and isomerisation time of 120 min at 96 C. The resulting products i. e. JAI concentrate and powder and lactulose-enriched MCP syrup (40 ºB) were tested for their prebiotic power in media broth and in fermented milk models. Prebiotic properties of these compounds were observed as supplementation levels increased from 0 - 2 % to 3 - 4 %. Based on the growth and acidification abilities of the probiotic strains tested, the combination of Lactobacillus casei LC- 01 with JAI, and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA- 5 with lactulose-enriched MCP syrup were found to be the best for {{development of}} synbiotic yoghurt. The prebiotic effect of JAIP was then compared with the two commercial chicory inulin products (Raftiline GR and Raftilose P 95). Probiotic yoghurts supplemented with 4 % inulin powders were prepared from reconstituted skim milk using mixed cultures of Lactobacillus casei LC- 01, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (1 : 0. 5 : 0. 5, w/w). The survival and acidifying activity of probiotic and lactic acid cultures were investigated during the shelf life of 28 days at 4 ºC. Incorporation of JAIP and chicory inulins resulted in a significant improvement in viability of LC- 01 compared with non-supplemented yoghurt, maintaining more than 107 CFU g- 1 throughout storage time. Additionally, the suitability of JAIP as fat replacer was determined in a set of fat-free yoghurt in comparison to three commercial chicory inulin products. Results of large deformation tests revealed that the firmness of JAIP-supplemented yoghurt was reduced to a similar level as the full-fat control yoghurt. However, small deformation results showed that the JAIP could not fully mimic milk fat to the same extent as Raftiline HP with an average DP of 23.

40|$|Recent {{analytical}} developments {{now make}} it possible to determine chalcophile and siderophile elements in situ in base metal sulfide minerals (BMS). Three points can be considered using these analyses: a) are the different elements preferentially concentrated in any particular BMS; b) what percentages of the siderophile and chalcophile elements are present in the BMS; c) what processes affect the distribution of the siderophile and chalcophile elements among the BMS. We have compared siderophile and chalcophile element distributions in pentlandite, chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite from platinumrich ore deposits that have undergone different cooling rates and degrees of metamorphism to address these questions. We found that Re, Os, Ir, Ru and Rh are concentrated in both pentlandite and pyrrhotite. In addition to these elements pentlandite concentrates Ni, Co and Pd. Copper, Zn, Cd and Ag are concentrated in chalcopyrite or cubanite. Gold and Pt do not preferentially concentrate in any particular BMS, with very little of these elements located in BMS. The BMS from sulfide droplets of the Noril'sk (Russia) host almost all of the siderophile elements (except Pt and Au) and much of the Co and Ag. Platinum occurs as Pt-bearing mineral inclusions within the BMS. The droplets occur in unmetamorphosed subvolcanic sills, which would have cooled relatively quickly. The high percentage of PGE in the BMS and the close association of the Pt-minerals with the BMS suggest that the model whereby a base metal sulfide liquid collected the siderophile and chalcophile elements to form the deposit is correct. We suggest that the Pt partitioned into the sulfide liquid and could have partitioned into the BMS at high temperatures, but that a lower temperatures the BMS structure would not accommodate the Pt and Pt-minerals exsolved during cooling. Alternatively, if Pt could not partition into the BMS then Pt would have <b>concentrated</b> in the <b>fractionated</b> sulfide liquid and crystallized as Pt-minerals from the final liquid. In the platinum-group element (PGE) reefs of unmetamorphosed layered intrusions (Busveld Complex, South Africa and Great Dyke, Zimbabwe) ∼ 30 to 60 % of the siderophile elements (except Pt and Au) are present in pentlandite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite. The balance is found in platinum-group minerals (PGM), which occur associated with the BMS. We suggest that the reason that a larger percentage of PGE are in the form of PGM {{is the result of the}} slower cooling of the BMS in the layered intrusion, which would allow more time for exsolution of the PGE than in the case of the BMS from subvolcanic sills. In the PGE-reefs from the metamorphosed layered intrusion (Penikat, Finland) the percentage of siderophile elements present in BMS covers a larger range, of ∼ 8 to 70 %. There are many more PGM present and there has been extensive recrystallization of the BMS. Most of the PGM are associated with BMS, but in many cases the Pd-bismuthotellurides and in a few cases the Pt-sulfarsenides and -arsenides are not found associated with BMS. Three processes could possibly have led to this. The BMS, which originally contained the PGM as exsolutions, dissolved during metamorphism, leaving behind insoluble PGM. Alternatively the bismuthotellurides, arsenides and sulfarsenides could have been locally remobilized from the BMS into the surrounding silicates during metamorphism. The third possibility is that Pd and to a lesser extent Pt could have been introduced to the PGE reef by fluids and precipitated as PGM from the fluid...|$|R
40|$|Polymers are omnipresent in {{the living}} world. All organisms contain {{different}} types of natural polymers {{that are responsible for}} different tasks, e. g. the formation of the molecular framework (lignin, cellulose) and energy reservoirs of plants (starch) or building up the genetic substance (DNA). Dead biomass is subjected to various abiotic and biotic transformation processes. With ongoing sedimentation the influence of increased temperature and pressure leads to further, partly significant, alteration of the original chemical structure, depending on its stability. Manmade macromolecules are another important group. These synthetic polymers are used in various fields of application and can be considered as ubiquitous. Some of them can be exposed to the environment in different ways and may disturb the aquatic and terrestrial biosphere. The chemical analysis of macromolecular substances is quite challenging due to their high molecular mass and, thus, their high boiling points. Spectroscopic methods as well as destructive degradation techniques are widely applied to characterise those polymers. The present study examined bisaccate pollen, handpicked out of six kerogen concentrates, with thermal maturities ranging from immature (0. 48 % VRr) to overmature (1. 45 % VRr). The main aim was the analysis of the thermal alteration of bisaccates in comparison to the bulk kerogens. Therefore, spectroscopic and pyrolysis methods were applied. The results obtained from invasive and non-invasive methods, as well as from micro- and macro analyses were compared. FTIR, µ-FITR and Laser-Pyrolysis–GC/MS (La-Py–GC/MS) analyses showed similar trends, for instance defunctionalisation and increasing aromatisation. Results from Curie Point–Pyrolysis-GC/MS (CP-Py–GC/MS) differed significantly, especially at higher stages of maturity. In addition to the spatially resolving analyses the kerogen <b>concentrates</b> were sieve <b>fractionated</b> (< 10 µm, 10 – 20 µm and 20 – 40 µm) and each fraction examined separately. The results of all fractionations were similar with regard to general trends with increasing maturation. The amorphous fraction (< 10 µm) released the highest amount of aliphatic compounds at all thermal maturity levels. In summary, this study indicated that invasive and non-invasive methods are suitable for bulk and spatially resolving analyses of fossil macromolecular materials and their combination provided comprehensive information about the chemical composition of the sample material. The high potential of La-Py–GC/MS as a spatially resolving and time efficient pyrolysis method for the analysis of tiny particles was shown {{in the first part of}} this study. However, the energy of the laser beam is quite difficult to control and the final temperature difficult to determine. Therefore, six biomacromolecules of different chemical composition, geological age and thermal maturity were subjected to La-Py–GC/MS and CP-Py–GC/MS. The main objective was to obtain information about the comparability of both methods and to estimate the temperature of the laser beam. The qualitative composition of the pyrolysates was similar in both methods, whereas La-Py–GC/MS released shorter aliphatic chains. Some samples showed linear trends of the relative composition with increasing pyrolysis temperature. Here, the laser-temperature was estimated to be higher than the highest Curie-temperature applied in this study (920 °C). All in all, La-Py–GC/MS is a suitable method for the analysis of highly mature and/or mainly aromatic materials, whereas for extant or immature materials CP-Py–GC/MS is more recommended. In the third part, three synthetic polymers that are commonly used in drilling fluids were examined to identify specific marker substances for the identification of contamination caused by drilling activities. Reference materials of the main constituents of these drilling fluids (CMC, HEC, PAA) were analysed to detect potential indicators. Additional analyses of seven CMC-, HEC- and PAA-based drilling fluids detected all previously identified compounds. Pyrolysis analysis of drill cuttings, with no information about the applied drilling fluid(s) provided no evidence for the use of one of the previously analysed samples but spiking experiments proved their traceability. All in all, this study confirmed pyrolysis to be a suitable analytical method for the chemical characterisation of various extant and fossil biomaterials as well as synthetic polymers. Its reproducibility (CP-Py) and spatial resolution (La-Py) combined with highly sensitive detector systems (GC/MS) provide significant advantages compared to other degradation methods...|$|R
