This article explores in detail the multiplicative {{complexity of}} symmetric Boolean functions. New techniques that allow such exploration are introduced. They are powerful enough to give exact multiplicative complexities for several classes of symmetric functions. In particular, the multiplicative complexity of computing the Hamming weight of n bits is shown to be exactly n−HN(n), where HN(n) is the Hamming weight of the binary representation of n. We also show a close relationship between the complexities of basic symmetric functions and the fractal known as Sierpinski’s gasket...|$|R

GEP undertook the development of NiMH technology for commercial cell applications in 1987. This program focused on wound cell technology for replacement of current NiCd technology. As an off shoot of this program small, wound cells were used to evaluate initial design options for aerospace prismatic cell designs. Early in 1991, the first aerospace prismatic cell designs were built in a 6 Ah cell configuration. These cells were used to initially characterize performance in prismatic configurations and begin early life cycle testing. Soon after the 6 Ah cells were on test, several 22 Ah cells were built to test other options. The results of testing of these cells were used to identify potential problem areas for long lived cells and develop solutions to those problems. Following these two cell builds, a set of 7 Ah cells was built to evaluate improvements to the technology. To date results from these tests are very promising. Cycle lives in excess of 2, 200 LEO cycles at 50 percent DoD were achieved with cells continuing on test. Results from these cell tests are discussed and data presented to demonstrate feasibility of this technology for aerospace programs...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} a new circuit sat based {{encoding}} of boolean formula is proposed. It makes an original {{use of the}} concept of restrictive models introduced by Boufkhad to polynomially translate any formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) to a circuit sat representation (a <b>conjunction</b> of <b>gates</b> and clauses). Our proposed encoding preserves the satisfiability of the original formula. The set of models of the obtained circuit w. r. t. the original set of variables is a subset of the models (with special characteristics) of the original formula. Each gate represents both a subset of clauses from the original CNF formula and a set of new additional clauses which constrains the set of models to those with a special structure. Using two variant of restrictive models, our circuit sat based encoding leads to a con- junction of two sub-formulas: a set of gates and a horn formula. We also provided a connection between our encoding and the satisfiability of the original formula i. e. when the input formula is satisfiable, our proposed translation delivers a full circuit formula. A new incremental preprocessing process is designed leading to interesting experimental improvements of Minisat a state-of-the-art satisfiability solver. Finally, using our circuit encoding, on many SAT instances interesting results are also obtained wrt. the backdoor set computation problem...|$|R

MIL 38 antibody, a mouse monoclonal antibody against Glypican 1, conjugated directly to the chelate via lysine residues, resulted in soluble (hydrophilic) and stable immunoconjugates. Indirect labeling of the antibody by a europium chelated secondary polyclonal antibody and a streptavidin/biotin pair was also performed. All of these bright luminescent conjugates were used to stain DU 145 cells, a prostate cancer cell line, using time gated luminescence microscopy for imaging, and their performances were compared to conventional FITC labeling.

40|$|Background-Sick sinus {{syndrome}} (SSS) is {{a common}} arrhythmia often associated with aging or organic heart diseases but may also occur in a familial form with a variable mode of inheritance. Despite the identifcation of causative genes, including cardiac Na channel (SCN 5 A), the pathogenesis and molecular epidemiology of familial SSS remain undetermined primarily because of its rarity. Methods and Results-We genetically screened 48 members of 15 SSS families for mutations in several candidate genes and determined the functional properties of mutant Na channels using whole-cell patch clamping. We identifed 6 SCN 5 A mutations including a compound heterozygous mutation. Heterologously expressed mutant Na channels showed loss-of-function properties of reduced or no Na current density in <b>conjunction</b> with <b>gating</b> modulations. Among 19 family members with SCN 5 A mutations, QT prolongation and Brugada syndrome were associated in 4 and 2 individuals, respectively. Age of onset in probands carrying SCN 5 A mutations was signifcantly less (mean±SE, 12. 4 ± 4. 6 years; n= 5) than in SCN 5 A-negative probands (47. 0 ± 4. 6 years; n= 10; P< 0. 001) or nonfamilial SSS (74. 3 ± 0. 4 years; n= 538; P< 0. 001). Meta-analysis of SSS probands carrying SCN 5 A mutations (n= 29) indicated profound male predominance (79. 3 %) resembling Brugada syndrome but with a considerably earlier age of onset (20. 9 ± 3. 4 years). Conclusions-The notable pathophysiological overlap between familial SSS and Na channelopathy indicates that familial SSS with SCN 5 A mutations may represent a subset of cardiac Na channelopathy with strong male predominance and early clinical manifestations...|$|R
40|$|Nanoscale {{control of}} charge doping in {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) materials permits {{the realization of}} electronic analogs of optical phenomena, relativistic physics at low energies, and technologically promising nanoelectronics. Electrostatic gating and chemical doping {{are the two most}} common methods to achieve local control of such doping. However, these approaches suffer from complicated fabrication processes that introduce contamination, change material properties irreversibly, and lack flexible pattern control. Here we demonstrate a clean, simple, and reversible technique that permits writing, reading, and erasing of doping patterns for 2 D materials at the nanometer scale. We accomplish this by employing a graphene/boron nitride (BN) heterostructure that is equipped with a bottom gate electrode. By using electron transport and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we demonstrate that spatial control of charge doping can be realized with the application of either light or STM tip voltage excitations in <b>conjunction</b> with a <b>gate</b> electric field.

Using phase-referenced observations at the VLBA, in <b>conjunction</b> with pulsar <b>gating</b> and in-beam calibration, we have measured the parallaxes and proper motions for 14 pulsars. The smallest measured parallax in our sample is 0. 13 +- 0. 02 mas for PSR B 1541 + 09, which has a most probable distance of 7. 2 + 1. 3 - 1. 1 kpc. We detail our methods, including initial VLA surveys to select candidates and find in-beam calibrators, VLBA phase-referencing, pulsar gating, calibration, and data reduction. The use of the bootstrap method to estimate astrometric uncertainties in the presence of unmodeled systematic errors is also described. Based on our new model-independent estimates for distance and transverse velocity, we investigate the kinematics and birth sites of the pulsars and revisit models of the Galactic electron density distribution. We find that young pulsars are moving away from the Galactic plane, as expected, and that age estimates from kinematics and pulsar spindown are generally in agreement, with certain notable exceptions. Given its present trajectory, the pulsar B 2045 - 16 was plausibly born in the open cluster NGC 6604. For several high-latitude pulsars, the NE 2001 electron density model underestimates the parallax distances by a factor of two, while in others the estimates agree with or are larger than the parallax distances, suggesting that the interstellar medium is irregular on relevant length scales. The VLBA astrometric results for the recycled pulsar J 1713 + 0747 are consistent with two independent estimates from pulse timing, enabling a consistency check between the different reference frames.

40|$|Primarily used as {{transparent}} electrodes in solar-cells, more recently, physical vapor deposited(PVD) {{transparent conductive oxide}} (TCO) materials (e. g. ZnO, In 2 O 3 and SnO 2) {{also serve}} as the active layer in thin-film transistor (TFT) technology for modern liquidcrystaldisplays. Relative to a-Si:H and organic TFTs, commercial TCO TFTs have reducedoff-state leakage and higher on-state currents. Additionally, since they are transparent, theyhave the added potential to enable fully transparent TFTs which can potentially improvethe power efficiency of existing displays. In addition to PVD, solution-processing is an alternative route {{to the production of}} displaysand other large-area electronics. The primary advantage of solution-processing is inthe ability to deposit materials at reduced-temperatures on lower-cost substrates (e. g. glass,plastics, paper, metal foils) at high speeds and over large areas. The versatility offered bysolution-processing is unlike any conventional deposition process making it a highly attractiveemergent technology. Unfortunately, the benefits of solution-processing are often overshadowed by a dramatic reductionin material quality relative to films produced by conventional PVD methods. Consequently,there is a need to develop methods that improve the electronic performance ofsolution-processed materials. Ideally, this goal can be met while maintaining relatively lowprocessing temperatures so as to ensure compatibility with low-cost roll-compatible substrates. Mobility is a commonly used metric for assessing the electronic performance of semiconductorsin terms of charge transport. It is commonly observed that TCO materials exhibit significantlyhigher field-effect mobility when used in <b>conjunction</b> with high-k <b>gate</b> dielectrics (10 to 100 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1) as opposed to conventional thermally-grown SiO 2 (0. 1 to 20 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1). Despite the large amount of empirical data documenting this bizarre effect, its physical ori- 2 gin is poorly understood. In this work, the interaction between semiconductor TCO films and high-k dielectrics isstudied with the goal of developing a theory explaining the observed mobility enhancement. Electrical investigation suggests that the mobility enhancement is due to an effective dopingof the TCO by the high-k dielectric, facilitated by donor-like defect states inadvertentlyintroduced into the dielectric during processing. The effect these states have on electrontransport in the TCO is assessed based on experimental data and electrostatic simulationsand is found to correlate with negative aspects of TFT behavior (e. g. frequency dispersion,gate leakage, hysteresis, and poor bias stability). Based on these findings, we demonstrate the use of an improved device structure, analogousto the concept of modulation doping, which uses the high-k dielectric film as an encapsulate,rather than a gate-dielectric, to achieve a similar doping effect. In doing so, the enhancedmobility of the TCO/high-k interface is retained while simultaneously eliminating the negativedrawbacks associated with the presence of charged defects in the gate dielectrics (e. g. frequency dispersion, gate leakage, hysteresis, and poor bias stability). This demonstratesimproved understanding of the role of solution-processed high-k dielectrics in field-effectdevices as well as provides a practical method to overcome the performance degradationincurred through the use of low-temperature solution-processed TCOs...|$|R
