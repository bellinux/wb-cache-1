This study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of treatments on raw material, the medium and pH extraction to the characteristics of the pectin produced from <b>cocoa</b> <b>skin,</b> and to analyse the economic feasibility of pectin production from <b>cocoa</b> <b>skin.</b> Production was started with pectin extraction using citric acid solvent to some variables : 1) type of raw material (fresh and dried), 2) extraction time (60 and 90 minutes), and 3) pH of the extraction (2. 5 and 3. 5), then was continued by clotting with 95 % ethanol, washing and drying of pectin. Economic analysis was done through analysis of break-even point (BEP) and the return cost ratio (RCR) to determine the level of benefits and feasibility of <b>cocoa</b> <b>skin</b> utilization. The results showed that the research treatments produced 5. 6 % - 6. 7 % pectin from initial weight of <b>cocoa</b> <b>skin</b> used, and the moisture content was 8. 7 % - 9. 58 %.

Parts of cocoa that have economic value are the seed, while the skin that is a waste of processing cocoa beans is often not utilized. <b>Cocoa</b> <b>skin</b> can cause environmental pollution problems. One way of handling waste is to extract <b>cocoa</b> <b>skin</b> becomes pectin. Known in the food industry pectin compounds is very important adjuvant because it is able to increase the viscosity of the fluid and form a gel with sugar and acid. The aim of this research was to determine the effect of pectin addition from cacoa skin waste on the quality of pineapple jam. There are four levels of the pectin addition in this study; 0, 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 %. Then the resulted pineapple jam was analysed; moisture content, total of dissolved solids, acidity, a smear of jam and hedonic sensory evaluation for appearance, aroma, flavor, texture and all vallue.
