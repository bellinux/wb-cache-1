5|$|Besides English {{translation}} and localization, the international version of Kingdom Hearts II {{differs from the}} original Japanese version {{in the content of}} gameplay and several scenes. The Hydra boss in the Hercules-themed world Olympus Coliseum had its green blood from the original Japanese version (which was taken from the film) <b>changed</b> <b>into</b> black and purple smoke in the English version. In one cutscene, Hercules fights the Hydra and uses his sword on its head, which eventually releases green blood from its mouth in the Japanese version; this was later <b>changed</b> <b>into</b> drool in the English version. There is also a scene in Disney Castle where, after chasing Donald around for missing a date, Daisy Duck pounds him on the backside in the Japanese version, whereas she merely tells him off inaudibly in the English version.|$|E

5|$|In {{an early}} account, Sophocles wrote that Tereus {{was turned into}} a large-beaked bird whom some {{scholars}} translate as a hawk while a number of retellings and other works (including Aristophanes' ancient comedy, The Birds) hold that Tereus was instead <b>changed</b> <b>into</b> a hoopoe. Various later translations of Ovid state that Tereus was transformed into other birds than the hawk and hoopoe, including references by Dryden and Gower to the lapwing.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Shepseskare continued {{the construction of the}} funerary complex of his predecessor. As Neferefre had died after a short reign, his pyramid complex was far from finished and neither the burial chamber nor the mortuary temple had been built. The planned pyramid was thus hastily <b>changed</b> <b>into</b> a square mastaba representing a stylized primeval hill and the accompanying mortuary temple was completed during the reign of Nyuserre.|$|E

5|$|According to the Shenboo Atlas of 1933, in the 1930s {{most people}} lived within the {{perimeter}} of the Xi'an Wall but still {{there were a lot of}} unoccupied open areas. Among the visitors who came to see the Xian Wall were American captain (later general) Stilwell in 1922 and the Czech sinologist Jaroslav Průšek (1906–1980) in 1933. In 1983, the administration of the Xi'an municipality carried out more renovations and additions to the wall. At that time, the Yangmacheng tower, the Zhalou sluice tower, the Kuixinglou dipper tower, the Jiaolou corner tower and the Dilou defense tower were all refurbished; the crumbling parts of the rampart were <b>changed</b> <b>into</b> gates; and the moat was restored. In May 2005, all of Xi'an's ramparts were inter-connected.|$|E
5|$|After the Norse occupation, the {{toponymy}} of Orkney {{became almost}} wholly West Norse. The Norse language <b>changed</b> <b>into</b> the local Norn, which lingered {{until the end}} of the 18th century, when it finally died out. Norn was replaced by the Orcadian dialect of Insular Scots. This dialect is at a low ebb due to the pervasive influences of television, education, and the large number of incomers. However, attempts are being made by some writers and radio presenters to revitalise its use and the distinctive sing-song accent and many dialect words of Norse origin remain in use. The Orcadian word most frequently encountered by visitors is peedie, meaning small, which may be derived from the French petit.|$|E

In the original screenplay, Chief was slated to die the same as in the novel, but Stevens did not want to have an on-screen death and modified the film so that he survived.|$|E

The Hotel and gardens were then sold, with plans published {{for the construction of}} a five-storey hotel to be built on the site. These plans were abandoned when the Empire Hotel was built on the opposite of the River Avon instead.|$|E

Thus his role was <b>changed</b> <b>into</b> a female hyena, Shenzi, who was voiced by Whoopi Goldberg.|$|E
