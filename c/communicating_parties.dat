25|$|Symmetric-key cryptosystems use {{the same}} key for {{encryption}} and decryption of a message, though a message or group of messages may have a different key than others. A significant disadvantage of symmetric ciphers is the key management necessary to use them securely. Each distinct pair of <b>communicating</b> <b>parties</b> must, ideally, share a different key, and perhaps each ciphertext exchanged as well. The number of keys required increases as {{the square of the}} number of network members, which very quickly requires complex key management schemes to keep them all consistent and secret. The difficulty of securely establishing a secret key between two <b>communicating</b> <b>parties,</b> when a secure channel does not already exist between them, also presents a chicken-and-egg problem which is a considerable practical obstacle for cryptography users in the real world.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{most of the}} {{existing}} identity-based key agreement schemes, it is usually assumed that either the <b>communicated</b> <b>parties</b> know each other’s identifier before the protocol starts or their identifiers are transferred along with the protocol messages. However, these schemes are not suitable for use in many real-world applications aimed to achieve unilateral identity privacy, which means that one <b>communicating</b> <b>party</b> {{does not want to}} expose his identifier to an outsider while his partner cannot know his identifier in advance. In this paper, we propose an efficient identity-based two-party key agreement scheme with unilateral identity privacy using pairing, and formally analyze its security in a modified Bellare-Rogaway key agreement security model. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Steganography is a {{technique}} used to conceal information {{in such a way}} that only the <b>communicating</b> <b>party</b> would know about the existence of the information. In this paper, Steganography is used to embed an encrypted QR Code into an image. The QR Code is encrypted using Triple DES algorithm in order to increase the level of security. The overall approach presented in this paper could potentially be used for secure communication and even for embedding signature/copyright information into an image. 1 Introduction to Steganography Steganography is {{a technique}} used to conceal information {{in such a way that}} only the <b>communicating</b> <b>party</b> would know about the existence of the information.

2500|$|Decimal {{fractions}} may {{be added}} {{to any of the}} three time elements. However, a fraction may only {{be added to}} the lowest order time element in the representation. A decimal mark, either a comma or a dot (without any preference as stated in resolution 10 of the 22nd General Conference CGPM in 2003, but with a preference for a comma according to ISO 8601:2004) is used as a separator between the time element and its fraction.

There is no limit on the number of decimal places for the decimal fraction. However, the number of decimal places needs to be agreed to by the <b>communicating</b> <b>parties.</b> For example, in Microsoft SQL Server, the precision of a decimal fraction is 3, i.e., [...] "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss".|$|E

In 2001, Yen el al. proposed an improved multiple-key agreement protocol to overcome the attacks that break the previous variants. However, the authors show that an impersonator can easily forge message without being detected, and can establish common session keys with the <b>communicating</b> <b>party.</b> To overcome all the weakness, we propose an improved scheme that also achieves better key utilization, compared to the previous variants.
