5|$|C. b. graptogyne, (Endangered) {{known as}} the {{south-eastern}} red-tailed black cockatoo, is found in southwestern Victoria and southeastern South Australia in an area bordered by Mount Gambier to the west, Portland to the south, Horsham to the northeast and Bordertown to the north. The smallest of the five subspecies, it was only recognised as distinct in the 1980s. It is predominantly dependent on stands of Eucalyptus baxteri (brown stringybark), Eucalyptus camaldulensis (river redgum) and Allocasuarina luehmannii (buloke) for feeding and nesting.

It has become rare on King Island, due to land <b>clearing</b> <b>and</b> possibly competition with the introduced common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) for nesting sites.

He organised a postal service to operate along the highways and public storehouses were built to alleviate starvation in drought-affected years. Gia Long enacted monetary reform and implemented a more socialized agrarian policy. However, the population growth far outstripped that of land <b>clearing</b> <b>and</b> cultivation. There was little emphasis on innovation in agricultural technology, so the improvements in productivity were mainly derived from increasing the amount of cultivated farmland.|$|E

In 1924 in northern Victoria, the red wattlebird was described as very wary, on account of being highly regarded (and shot) for its meat. Indeed, it was shot widely for food or sport, or because it was held to be a pest of vineyards or orchards. On occasion, red wattlebirds have raided vineyards and orchards for grapes, stone fruit, figs, olives, loquats, apples, pears and berries, which they puncture and extract the juice or flesh from.|$|E

40|$|Shoshana Smith {{now goes}} by her married name, Shoshana Brassfield: [URL] Descartes famously claims that {{everything}} we perceive clearly and distinctly is true. Although this rule {{is fundamental to}} Descartes’s theory of knowledge, readers from Gassendi and Leibniz onward have complained that unless Descartes can say explicitly what <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> distinct perception is, how we know when we have it, and why it cannot be wrong, then the rule is empty. I offer {{a detailed analysis of}} <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> distinct perception, showing how Descartes answers these questions. Many doubts about the usefulness of the clarity and distinctness rule arise from the mistaken assumption that in <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> distinct perception, like sense perception, we must be able to establish a correspondence between perception and reality before we can have knowledge. I show that Descartes has a different metaphysical picture of <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> distinct perception. <b>Clear</b> <b>and</b> distinct perception is direct perception, typically of essences. On this view, by relying on the intellect instead of the senses, we can have direct perception not only of our own ideas, but also of a mind-independent reality. Because <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> distinct perception is direct perception, problems of correspondence do not arise. My account of <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> distinct perception also yields unique insight into other issues in Descartes, such as the Cartesian Circle and the doctrine of the free creation of the eternal truths.
