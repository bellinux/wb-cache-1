50|$|Mongoose {{belong to}} a family closely related to civets. In China, they are {{considered}} beneficial animals because they eat rodents and snakes, which {{are considered to be}} pests. Mongoose have immunity from snake venom. Both the small Asian mongoose and <b>crab-eating</b> <b>mongoose</b> are found in southern China, Hainan and Taiwan.|$|E
50|$|The <b>crab-eating</b> <b>mongoose</b> {{is common}} in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, {{northern}} Myanmar and northeastern India. The species is rare in Bangladesh. It has been recorded at elevations from sea level to 1800 m.In Nepal, it inhabits subtropical evergreen and moist deciduous forests, and has also been observed on agricultural land near human settlements.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crab-eating</b> <b>mongooses</b> {{are usually}} {{active in the}} mornings and evenings, and were {{observed}} in groups of up to four individuals. They {{are supposed to be}} good swimmers, and hunt along the banks of streams and close to water.|$|R
50|$|In {{this part}} of the zoo, {{visitors}} can take a look at animals which are native to Taiwan, such as wild boar, <b>crab-eating</b> <b>mongooses,</b> clouded leopards, Formosan sika deer, European otters, Reeves's muntjac, Formosan rock macaques, Formosan pangolins, Formosan serow and Formosan black bears.|$|R
50|$|Chitwan is {{considered}} to have the highest population density of sloth bears with an estimated 200 to 250 individuals. Smooth-coated otters inhabit the numerous creeks and rivulets. Bengal foxes, spotted linsangs and honey badgers roam the jungle for prey. Striped hyenas prevail on the southern slopes of the Churia Hills. During a camera trapping survey in 2011, wild dogs were recorded in the southern and western parts of the park, as well as golden jackals, fishing cats, jungle cats, leopard cats, large and small Indian civets, Asian palm civets, <b>crab-eating</b> <b>mongooses</b> and yellow-throated martens.|$|R
50|$|H. urva is {{generally}} grey in color, {{with a broad}} white stripe on its neck extending from its cheeks to its chest. Its throat is steel-gray with white ends of its hair, rendering a salt and pepper appearance. Its hind feet possess hairy soles. Its tail is short and homogeneously colored with a fairer tip. The body of the <b>crab-eating</b> <b>mongoose</b> is 36 - 52 cm in length, and 1 - 2.3 kg in weight.|$|E
50|$|The <b>crab-eating</b> <b>{{mongoose}}</b> (Herpestes urva) is a mongoose species {{ranging from}} the northeastern Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia, southern China and Taiwan. Throughout its wide range there are many languages and therefore various common names for the species. In particular, according to at least some major dictionaries, {{the source of the}} species name urva (which at one time was also the name of the genus, as in: Urva urva) was the Nepali language urvá or arvá.|$|E
5000|$|The red-legged sun {{squirrel}} (Heliosciurus rufobrachium) is {{a species}} of rodent in the family Sciuridae, also {{commonly known as the}} <b>crab-eating</b> <b>mongoose</b> and the isabelline red-legged sun squirrel. It is native to tropical western and central Africa where its range extends from Senegal in the west, through Nigeria and the Republic of Congo to Uganda and Tanzania in the east. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and moist savanna. This species is thought to be common and has a very wide distribution, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
40|$|The food habits, {{movement}} and activity patterns, and habitat use of sympatric carnivores, and wildlife harvest and utilization, were {{studied at the}} Taohong Village, Jiangxi Province, southeastern China during 1992 – 1996. ^ Food habits of four species of sympatric carnivores were studied by scat analysis. <b>Crab-eating</b> <b>mongooses</b> (Herpestes urva) had the most diversified diet that included many water-edge food items. Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) consumed {{a large proportion of}} fruits. Both small Indian civets (Viverricula indica) and hog badgers (Arctonyx collaris) fed heavily on rodents. Though there was a certain degree of difference in habitat use among these species, the rather high diet overlap suggested that the population densities of these species were reduced to a very low level by constant harvest pressure and secondary poisoning so that the diet ceased to have relevant effect on the sympatry of these species. The food habits (based on scat analysis) of the sympatric dhole (Cuon alpinus) and wolf (Canis lupus) showed that their depredation on the endangered Sika deer (Cervus nippon kopschi), domestic animals and small carnivores was negligible. ^ Telemetry studies showed that small Indian civets, masked palm civets, and <b>crab-eating</b> <b>mongooses</b> did not have permanent dens but moved among their numerous daybeds. Small Indian civets used daybeds among the bushes and grass on the ground while other species used underground dens exclusively. Small Indian civets and crabeating mongooses limited their activity to the foothills at low altitude, while masked palm civets included habitat of higher altitude in their home ranges. Both small Indian civets and masked palm civets were nocturnal, but the latter had a low activity level in the daytime. <b>Crab-eating</b> <b>mongooses</b> were active in the daytime. ^ Ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) were strictly nocturnal. Their daybeds included both natural and man-made sites. The lack of direct conflict of interest with humans allowed them to live in close proximity to human settlement. ^ Wildlife harvest during the 1992 / 96 harvest seasons was studied by the method of participant observation. Wildlife harvesters comprised 1. 5 % of the local population, and a few professional harvesters accounted for {{a large proportion of the}} game yield. Shotguns and two kinds of traps were the most common harvest methods used. Muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) and hares (Lepus sinensis and L. capensis) were the most important game species. In spite of the steady increase in the price of wildlife parts, the game yields experienced a gradual decline due to reduced harvest efforts. Wildlife harvest was market-oriented and played an insignificant supplemental role in the local economy. Marketing channels for both pelt and game meat have been well established and are spreading. Wildlife harvest remained largely unregulated. The prospect of wildlife harvest at Taohong is discussed and recommendations to control harvest are proposed. ...|$|R
50|$|Since 2002 several {{surveys have}} been carried out to {{determine}} the faunal diversity of the protected area. In a field study carried out from July 2003 to July 2004, Indian leopard, jungle cat, large Indian civet, golden jackal, Himalayan black bear, yellow-throated marten, small Asian mongoose, Himalayan goral, barking deer, wild boar, rhesus monkey, Hanuman langur, Chinese pangolin, Indian crested porcupine, Himalayan pika, black-naped hare, Indian hare, Himalayan squirrel, fawn-colored mouse, brown-toothed shrew and black rat were identified. Clouded leopard, leopard cat, jungle cat, large Indian civet, masked palm civet, <b>crab-eating</b> <b>mongoose,</b> pangolin, rhesus macaque and yellow-throated marten, were camera trapped in 2010.In 2008, intermediate horseshoe, greater horseshoe and big-eared horseshoe bats were mist netted at the entrance of Nagarjuna cave inside the park.|$|E
50|$|Sepahijala Wildlife Sanctuary is a {{wildlife}} sanctuary in Tripura, India of some 18.53 km2, about 25 km {{from the city}} centre, located in Bishalgarh. It is a woodland with an artificial lake and natural botanical and zoological gardens. It {{is famous for its}} clouded leopard enclosures. The sanctuary contains a variety of birds, primates, and other animals. The terrain is green throughout the year and the weather is temperate except for the two humid summer months of March and April. It gives shelter to about 150 species of birds and the unique bespectacled monkey, Phayre's langur.The primate section consists of four species (rhesus macaque, pig-tailed macaque, capped langur and spectacled langur). The <b>crab-eating</b> <b>mongoose</b> (last sighted in the 1930s) has been resuscitated. The sanctuary has been developed both as {{a wildlife}} sanctuary and as an academic and research centre.About 150 species of birds live in the sanctuary, and migratory birds visit in winter. Initiated in 1972 the sanctuary has five sections: carnivores, primates, ungulates, reptiles and aviary. There are several lakes;among which Amrit Sagar named lake have boating facility.|$|E
30|$|Undigested {{leaves were}} found in the feces of the African civet Civettictis civetta and were thought to help with {{digestion}} and possibly to be of medicinal value (Bekele et al. 2008). Folded and undigested grass was also reported in the feces of the Chinese lesser civet Viverricula indica at various locations across Taiwan (Chuang and Lee 1997; H Su, unpublished data); however, this behavior and its possible function have not yet been described. Ecological studies of the Chinese lesser civet are limited. Its diet was studied and compared to two other sympatric carnivore species, the Formosan ferret-badger Melogale moschata and <b>crab-eating</b> <b>mongoose</b> Herpestes urva (Chuang and Lee 1997). The Chinese lesser civet was found to consume both animal and plant matter. Insects are the most important food item in its diet. It was also pointed out that the average daily travel distance of the civet is about 500 m (Lee and Chou 2004). Information on activity patterns and social organization is currently not available.|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{loss and}} {{fragmentation}} {{are a key}} threat {{to the survival of}} several small carnivore species in Southeast Asia. Enhancing habitat connectivity is therefore an important conservation strategy. In Peninsular Malaysia, the government plans to connect its fragmented forests via 17 habitat linkages to form a large contiguous forest complex known as the Central Forest Spine. Small carnivore species composition in these linkages remains poorly documented. Of the 12 species detected in and around Linkage 7, in the state of Terengganu, four are categorised as Vulnerable by The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species: Binturong Arctictis binturong, Banded Civet Hemigalus derbyanus, Oriental Small-clawed Otter Aonyx cinereus and Smooth-coated Otter Lutrogale perspicillata. A photograph of <b>Crab-eating</b> <b>Mongoose</b> Herpestes urva with young is the first record of this species from Terengganu, extending eastwards its known distribution in Peninsular Malaysia. Forests in and around this linkage are threatened by disturbance associated with an existing road, and the construction of a nearby dam. The study area’s relatively high recorded small carnivore species richness, and its complement of globally threatened small carnivore species, supports its inclusion into a proposed protected area (known as the Kenyir Wildlife Corridor). Information on small carnivores in other linkages warrants publication, especially from camera-trap surveys that consciously account for microhabitat use and behavioural variation between different species. This would allow a clearer understanding of small carnivore communities in Peninsular Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|Carnivores are at {{the higher}} trophic levels and have {{garnered}} much attention in conservation and management efforts. In this study, we attempted to understand resource partitioning among sympatric carnivores existing in a primary forest with minimal human disturbance in southern Taiwan by camera trapping after {{the disappearance of the}} top carnivore, the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa). Niche relationships were studied in terms of habitat, diet, and time dimensions. Six carnivore species were recorded, but the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus formosanus) was very rare. Canonical correspondence analysis of photographic rates and habitat factors of the other 5 carnivores showed that elevation was the strongest factor explaining the composition of the carnivore community in the habitat dimension. Carnivores could be divided into 3 groups. The low- to mid-elevation group consisted of the gem-faced palm civet (Paguma larvata taivana) and <b>crab-eating</b> <b>mongoose</b> (Herpestes urva formosanus) which had contrasting activity patterns and different diets; the mid- to high-elevation group consisted of yellow-throated marten (Martes flavigula chrysospila) and Siberian weasel (Mustela sibirica taivana). These 2 mustelids had similar diets, but Siberian weasels tended to avoid yellow-throated martens temporally. The Formosan ferret badger (Melogale moschata subaurantiaca) was more widely distributed along the elevational gradient. Ferret badgers partitioned resource use in either diet, activity patterns, or other habitat gradients from the other carnivores. Niche segregation and complementary resource use were observed in these 5 carnivores...|$|E
