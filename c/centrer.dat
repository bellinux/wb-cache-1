After shear the crystal displays other structures. At low volume fractions (0. 1 – 0. 3 %), some reflexions disappear by light scattering whereas a strong diffuse “prepeak" appears before the first Bragg peak for higher concentrations (2 – 12 %) evidenced by USAXS. This “prepeak" can be attributed to defects in the crystal. Osmotic pressures have been measured by difference between the hydrostatic pressure in the solution and in the reservoir separated by an hemipermeable membrane. The experimental data are very well reproduced by the Poisson Boltzmann Cell (PBC) theory which shows that the interaction between particles is purely repulsive. No attractive contribution has been experimentally detected. By calculating the mean square displacement of a particle inside its cage from the eccentric PBC model, we have verified that the Lindemann criterion for the existence of crystals (against melting) is satisfied. This study has allowed to determine the equation of state of an electrostatical colloidal crystal and is equivalent to an ultraprecise force/distance measurement between latex particles since the measured forces are of the order of 10 - 12 N for distances of the order of 4000 Å...|$|R

It is found that the year-to-year changes of the mean zonal winds in SH winter and spring (August, September and October) in that lower stratosphere have shown no clear trends during the period from 1980 to 1988,in contrast to the ozone depletion and temperature decline. However, there are apparent differences in the zonal wind comparison between the 19802 ̆ 7 s and the early 19702 ̆ 7 s which are cited from the new CIRA model compiled by BARNETT and CORNEY (1985,Handbook for MAP, Vol. 16, 47).

40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of {{clinical}} psychology and psychotherapeutic techniques, patient and therapist utterances frequently include linguistic metaphorsof the body. A metaphor {{is not only a}} stylistic device but also a tool for conceptualizing one’s experience. In Freud’s view, for example,the notion of the body as a “container” or “source” is one of the basic concepts of his psychodynamic theory: “According to a childhood belief,babies come from men urinating into a woman’s body” or “It is undeniable that the libido has somatic sources”. More specifically, thefollowing can be observed in psychotherapy: a) Variable-induction relaxation is based on therapeutic suggestions concerning sensations andimages. Patients are often surprised by these words and images because they had not succeeded in giving voice to their suffering and, as aresult, were confronted with an excess of sensations and feelings: “I feel sick at heart and full of bitterness”, “I feel like my head’s in a vise”,“my body had disappeared”; b) La Décentration is based on figurative utterances about the body. During initial instructions the therapist willsay, “Imagine that, starting at your toes, imagine that you are a small bubble and that you’re going to slowly move up inside your body; whenyou arrive at the tips of your fingers, stay there, waiting; you’re going to feel little hearts that beat at the tips of your fingers; you’re waiting,open to everything happening in your body”; c) Ericksonian hypnosis, developed by Milton Erickson, is characterized in part by the use ofindirect suggestions based on linguistic metaphors of the body: “You can wake up as a person [...] . but you don’t have to wake up as a body”;“You can wake up when your body wakes up, but you won’t recognize your body”. Also: “Now, of course, the first step toward dissolving yourlegs [...] . and [...] . dissolving your hands”. The importance of linguistic metaphors of the body in clinical psychopathology led us to view suchmetaphors as “indicators of conceptual metaphors of the body”. That is why the fields of psychiatry, psychoanalysis and psychotherapy werea necessary point of departure for our research. In addition, we wanted to extend our investigation to poetic literature because of its largenumber of highly creative figurative expressions. Firstly, the objective of our study was to identify different types of body conceptualizationsexpressed in psychoanalytic and psychiatric practise and in poetic works selected for their focus on this theme. Secondly, our objective was to organize these conceptualizations into categories of conceptual metaphors based on a model inspired by theresearch of Lakoff and Johnson. The analysis of psychiatric and psychoanalytic manuals and works of poetic literature showed differences inthe use of conceptual metaphors in these respective discourses. In psychiatric manuals, the conceptualization of the body centers on the ideaof the BODYAS CONTAINER, with no stereotyped mental images or specific mental images about body organs. In psychoanalysis, linguisticmetaphors of the body focus on the following terms: “genital organs”, “mouth”, “uterus”, “penis”, “phallus”, “anus”, “vagina”, and “bodyorifice”. Linguistic metaphors of the body in the selected works of poetic literature tended to conceptualize the body as an integrated systemof experiences. These metaphors focussed on various organs and bodily substances, such as “heart”, “blood”, “chest”, “arm(s) ”, “eye(s) ”,“breast(s) ”, “face”, “head”, “flesh”, “skin”, “hand(s) ” and “tongue”. Poetry offers us the opportunity to create, deepen and reconstruct emotionalexperiences through the richness of metaphorical thought. With the growth of the neurosciences, poetic thought could serve as animportant resource for the conceptualization of the body. Concerning methodology: • we searched for 178 words and their occurrence inmanuals and poetic works regarding the concept of corporality and the symbolic parts of the body; • the research corpus for poetry includednine poets (each poet representing a century); overall, we searched for nine works of Italian poetry (579, 469 words) from the 12 th to the 20 thcentury using LIZ 3. 0 software with textual analysis capabilities; • the research corpus for psychoanalysis included sections entitled “anorexianervosa”, or “eating disorders” in the most recent manual of Italian psychoanalysis schools (8, 640 words); a traditional French psychoanalyticglossary (195, 320 words); and a single French thematic index (760, 480 words) of Freud’sWorks; • the research corpus for psychiatryincluded a well-known Italian manual of psychiatry and psychotherapy; sections entitled “anorexia nervosa” or “eating disorders” in fivepsychiatric manuals (60, 779 words); and the entire corpus (563, 953 words) of DSM-IV. Our categorization provided an alternative to theanatomical description of the body; we called this alternative a perceptive-literary construction of the body. It is characterized by a bodilynarrative based on figurative utterances concerning anatomical and physiological features and conceptual metaphors of reference. Dans le domaine de la psychopathologie clinique et des techniques de psychothérapie, les énoncés des patients et des thérapeutes compor-tent fréquemment des métaphores linguistiques du corps. En effet, une métaphore n'est pas seulement une figure de style, mais également le support d'une conceptualisation de l'expérience. Dans un premier temps, notre étude a pour objectif de repérer les différents types de concep-tualisation du corps qui s'expriment dans la pratique psychanalytique, la pratique psychiatrique, et dans des ouvrages poétiques sélectionnés pour leur centration sur ce thème. Dans un second temps, notre objectif consiste à organiser ces conceptualisations en catégories de métapho-res conceptuelles selon un modèle inspiré des recherches de Lakoff et Johnson. L'analyse des traités de psychiatrie, des traités de psychana-lyse et des ouvrages poétiques montre que l'usage des métaphores conceptuelles dans ces discours respectifs est différent. Dans les traités de psychiatrie, la conceptualisation du corps est centrée sur l'idée d'un CORPS-CONTENANT, sans images mentales stéréotypées ni images mentales spécifiques sur des organes corporels. Dans la psychanalyse, les métaphores linguistiques du corps sont centrées sur les termes suivants : « organes génitaux », « bouche », « utérus », « pénis », « phallus », « anus », « vagin », « orifice corporel ». Les métaphores linguistiques du corps dans les ouvrages poétiques sélectionnés s'appliquent davantage à conceptualiser le corps comme un système intégré d'expériences. Ces métaphores portent sur différents organes et substances corporels : « coeur », « sang », « poitrine », « le/les bras », « oeil/yeux », « sein/s », « visage », « tête », « chair », « peau », « main/s », « langue ». On constate ainsi que ces catégorisations psycholo-giques et littéraires évitent toute description anatomique du corps pour <b>centrer</b> leur discours sur un domaine particulier que nous allons appeler « Construction perceptive-littéraire du corps »...|$|E

They scattered for the balance of the day, some going to Ekelsbeke, other to Arnèke, both sets listening to sermons, only to return at nightfall, this time to the chaplain's house,where they had something to eat and pocketed four candles. Afterward, they randomly searched private houses looking for objects the churchwardens might have hidden, or domestic altars or shrines. The next morning, they continued their efforts, overturning basins of holy oil, smashing up more altars, and shredding the priest's and chaplains's books.

We observe clear differences {{as a function of}} size and shape for all types of packing; in particular the surface aspect ratios (surface-to-bulk) of the shapes strongly influences the ‘growth curves’ {{as a function of the}} number of atoms for all packing types examined. Discrimination between the different types of structure based on the coordination shell occupancy appears possible, although is dependent on the type of packing. For fcc and hcp packing, structures comprising less than 200 atoms, and particularly less than 100 atoms, exhibit strong variation in the first shell coordination number as a function of shape. For bcc structures this dependency of the coordination shell number for small clusters is much less pronounced and in some cases (for higher shell (>N 4) coordination numbers) an opposite trend is observed in that the difference in coordination number as a function of shape becomes more marked with an increasing number of atoms. For the fcc bimetallic systems, model structures possessing distinct bimetal distributions, including both non-random and random alloy types, were simulated and examined. Clear variations in both the 1 st shell coordination number and in the simulated spectra were observed as a function of the bimetal structure. A dual edge analysis of the data and subsequent examination of the coordination shell numbers as a function of the bimetal distribution enables for the size, composition and distribution of the each species, to be determined...|$|R

40|$|International audienceInscription, instruction, sanction: The 'in-between' doing of a norm in {{the process}} of medical record {{computerization}} In this communication, we focus on the practical and agency of the norm rather than on the institutional dimensions by which it is usually studied. In doing so, we propose to question the norm's specificities that makes it a source of what Latour (1994, 2000) names the 'making-do' [le faire-faire]. As such, the norm is both the object of people's agency - what they act upon - and an agent that makes people act - what they deal with. The term of 'making-do' suggested by Latour underlines this dialectic dimension of agency. Following Souriau, we propose therefore to explore the 'in-between' of the doing of a norm, identifying the way it acts and the way people act under and possibly upon the norm. This communication is issued from a collective research program between two research teams, namely CERTOP - ECORSE in Toulouse, and ComSanté, in Montréal. The norm under study was enacted by the French National Healthcare Authority (Haute Autorité de Santé, hereafter HAS). This norm is nowadays the basis for the certification of French healthcare establishments, whose activities depend on this agreement. This communication is based on a longitudinal long-term case study, engaged in 2008, in a French hospital (and more specifically wards dedicated to oncology), involved {{in the process}} of computerization of medical records. Our observations began six months before the first implementation, that took place step by step, wards after wards, during nearly a year, with a follow up since then. For this paper, we will focus on an in-depth interview with a head nurse involved in the project team. This hour-and-a-half filmed interview has as main subject the evolution of clinical records, from the previous paper records and related practices to the current electronic ones, with demonstration and specific focus on main transformations all along the overall process of computerization. This process considered as a whole took place during more than ten years. Based on a discourse analysis, we have chosen to follow up the manifestation of one of the HAS' norms, that is the medico-legal reporting. With the computerization of medical records, the norm and its enactment have gained a renewed materiality that gives rise to an improved agency. To question this evolution, we rely on the notion of inscription as developed firstly in Science and Technology Studies, and mobilized thereafter in Organizational Studies (Akrich, 1992; Joerges & Czarniawska, 1998; Latour, 1993; Verbeek, 2006, Taylor & Van Every, 2000, 2011). We will focus more precisely on the forms of textualization of the norm that take place in the electronic medical records. The notion of inscription is useful here for analyzing the way the norm is textualized (or even more, in this case, instrumentalized) in the electronic medical records; this focus highlights the writing practices (who writes, when, where, how) involved in the medical record computerization as well as the authoring issues that the HAS' norm puts forward. The norm as textualized in/by the toolThe HAS advice specified in its certification handbook and followed up by the experts in charge of auditing provided the main arguments for medical record computerization. These arguments refer to an 'ideal' way of producing information, with great emphasis on a single registration of information, and on the continuity and control of data flows. According to this, the paperless wards and the computerization extended to the totality of the activities was seen as guarantying a good information treatment (Harper & al., 1997; Sellen & al., 2001). The medicolegal norm is put forward to legitimate the computerization, with a related argument concerning the potential legalization of the patient-practitioner relationship. A law published in France on March 2002 has strengthened the possibility for the patients to get access to their medical record. The patient is thus one of the quoted figures to legitimate the implementation of the electronic tool. The underlined quality of the tool is its capacity of strictly registering who wrote a specific information, who is the author and therefore the responsible for the medical act; so doing, the tool enables to decide who accounts for and who is accountable for. Because of the renewed materiality of the norm, of its inscription {{in the form of the}} computerized medical record, the norm's agency appears to be less visible, it seems more neutral, its origin is decontextualized, its authority is blurred. The apparently main agent is neither the norm nor the accreditation process, it is a supposed-to-be-neutral entity - that is to say, the technology - that is meant to treat the information efficiently and insure the accurate follow up of the patients. The enrolled norm is formally detached from its author; it is hidden behind the computerization process. Meanwhile, this norm gives form to the tool, setting up the framework of the dedicated software and databases, designed and operationalized according to the legal definition of employee territories and of tracking requirements. The related objective of the tool deals with being able to account for responsibilities through inscriptions. The incorporated norm prescribes the territories of agencies, their relations, and the people who are held responsible. So doing, it renews a traditional and legal hierarchy according to which the physicians are the writing masters. Writing practices and authoring issuesIn the hospital we studied, the computerization process is seen as an opportunity for the staff and the project team to select the authorized practices, to sustain the 'best' ones, and to bring back each employee to his/her authorized professional territory. Physicians are legally the exclusive authors of medical decisions. When implementing electronic medical records, the project team took this opportunity to specify who is authorized to write according to the type of documents and information that is required for the patient's follow-up. This writing practice in the electronic medical record strongly links an author/authority and a domain of information. Access codes and parameters play as filters to reallocate the roles and authorized practices to employees according to legal texts and registered protocols. In so doing, the link is strengthened between the norm, responsibility and potential sanction. The equipped norm helps specifying the practiced territories and related authorities. It aims at countering the inscriptions that were previously crossing the barriers, setting up forms of inter-relation and translation. Such translations and relations are set up to facilitate cure and care practices through the reconstruction of patient stories. However, part of these practices was infringing the legal rules. With the electronic tool, such practices are not possible anymore. This is more specifically the case of an element of the paper medical record that has been excluded from the electronic version. Conclusion: From authoring traces to de-authored texts [...] . a broken promise of the power of the norm?The computerization of medical record has been stated as a guarantee against gaps between legal authority and daily practices. It was supposed to supply a continuous tracking of activities in the case of potential sanction through identifying responsibilities. It was supposed to be a magic and powerful tool, capable to tell who does what, where and when. However, effective practices partly escape from this close-meshed net. The problem the tool was supposed to solve reoccurs somewhere else. Moreover, the main issue deals with sense making, with the meaning of the global text and its accuracy for care and cure. The produced text is made of a diversity of locally registered and signed writings. Taken as a whole, it can be seen as a de-authoredtext (Taylor & Van Every, 2011), the product of a collective writing (Callon, 2002), where authoring/authority is distributed and sometimes blurred in the mechanics of the computerization process. In the electronic tool design, a great concern as been devoted in identifying the local inscriptions and their authors. Yet the question of the overall sense making of the patient stories stays unanswered, as well as the plots discussed during the passing on (Boudes & al., 2005; Browning, 1992). With the focus dedicated to reallocating each employee in the limits of his legal territory, it seems that there is no possibility left to related stories, discussed plots, and translations. These plots and related stories give way to new forms of writing, which are non-authorized ones; they are also shared in conversations. Therefore, they escape from the tool and weaken the tracing project, the very reason for equipping the norm through a supposed to be omnipotent tool. Dans cette communication nous proposons d'appréhender la norme, non pas tant d'un point du vue institutionnel que du point de vue de l'action. Il s'agit alors de s'interroger sur les spécificités de la norme qui font d'elle une source de faire-faire (Latour, 1994) : ce sur quoi on agit mais qui en même temps nous fait agir. L'expression faire-faire comme le suggère Latour (2000) souligne le caractère dialectique de l'action redoublant les deux maîtrises, celle de la norme et celle de ceux qui la mobilisent. À l'instar de Souriau nous proposons ainsi d'explorer les entre-faire de la norme afin d'y déceler ce qu'elle fait et ce qui en est fait. Cette communication s'inscrit dans un programme de recherche associant deux équipes, l'une en France l'autre au Québec. La norme envisagée est celle qui est édictée en France par la Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS), et qui sert désormais de base à la certification des établissements de soins. Au fil du temps, cette certification est passée du statut de démarche recommandée pour améliorer la qualité et la sécurité des soins et pour faire preuve de ce travail de maîtrise, à une obligation qui conditionne pour les établissements concernés le fait de pouvoir poursuivre leur activité dans le domaine pour lequel ils ont été accrédités. L'étude porte sur un établissement de soins en France plus particulièrement sur des services de cancérologie Il s agit d une étude qualitative longitudinale initiée mi 2008 soit six mois avant le premier déploiement d'un dossier de soins informatisé (80 h d'observations dans les services, 10 réunions ou séances de formation, 18 entretiens). Dans le cadre plus spécifique de cette communication, nous mobiliserons un entretien filmé mené auprès d'un cadre de santé qui rend compte de la composition des précédents dossiers patients sur supports papier, des pratiques associées et de certains éléments clé de leur transformation au fil de leur informatisation. À partir d une analyse de discours nous retraçons les manifestations d'une des normes édictées par la HAS, la norme de reporting médico-légale. Le processus d'informatisation du dossier de soins met en relief les modes d'action associés à la matérialisation de la norme et ses usages. Afin d'aborder ces questions nous mobilisons la notion d'inscription développée à l'origine par les Science and Technology Studies et ensuite traduite dans les études sur les organisations (Akrich, 1992; Joerges Czarniawska, 1998; Latour, 1993; Verbeek 2006; Taylor Van Every 2000, 2011). Nous nous penchons plus particulièrement sur les formes de textualisation de la norme dans le processus d'informatisation du dossier patient. La notion d'inscription nous permet dans le cas étudié de <b>centrer</b> l'analyse sur la mise-en-texte (ou plutôt ici la mise-en-outil) de la norme dans le dossier de soins informatisé, les modalités d'écriture (qui écrit, où, quand et comment) et la question de la signature, des thèmes qui ressortent de notre analyse. La norme mise-en-texte dans par un outilL'informatisation est argumentée sur la base des recommandations de la HAS, qui dans son manuel de certification et par la voix des auditeurs qu'elle envoie dans les établissements, fait référence à un idéal de saisie unique de l'information et de continuité des flux d'informations dans une acception selon laquelle le tout informatisé et le zéro papier seraient la condition de félicité d'un bon traitement de l'information (Harper al 1997; Sellen al 2001). La légitimation de l'informatisation prend ainsi appui sur la référence à une norme de reporting médico légal; un argument associé concerne la possible judiciarisation de la relation de soins. La loi du 4 mars 2002 ayant renforcé le droit des patients d'accéder à leur dossier, le patient fait partie des figures invoquées pour légitimer le recours à un outil permettant d attribuer chaque écrit à son auteur pour être à même d'en rendre compte et de rendre des comptes. La matérialisation de cette norme voire son inscription dans le dossier informatisé vient d'une part neutraliser son agir, elle décontextualise son origine, brouillant les traces de l'auteur. Il ne s agit plus de la norme de reporting médico-légal, ni du processus d accréditation, il s'agit d'une entité présentée comme neutre - la technologie - qui assure le traitement adéquat de l'information et en bout de ligne le suivi du patient. La norme inscrite se détache de son auteur et d'une certaine manière se rend invisible, masquée par le processus d'informatisation. D'autre part, l'inscription de la norme dans cet outil technique vient aussi cadrer les modalités du système informatique, un système conçu et opérationnalisé en termes de définition des territoires et de traçabilité : "qui fait quoi et comment" étant la prémisse qui le sous-tend. La norme inscrite prescrit l'agencement et les aires d'action ainsi que les responsables. Ce faisant elle recrée une hiérarchie dans laquelle le médecin devient le maître écrivainLes modalités d écriture, la question de la signatureDans l'établissement étudié, l'informatisation est l'occasion de faire le tri, de dire ce que sont les bonnes pratiques et de ramener chacun sur son territoire autorisé d'intervention. Les praticiens ont l'exclusivité des décisions médicales. L'informatisation est l'occasion pour l'équipe projet de préciser qui est autorisé à faire quoi sur les documents - qui en est l'auteur - et de finaliser le paramétrage des documents et leur mode d accès en référence aux décrets et réglementations spécifiant les rôles des différents professionnels. En cela le lien entre la norme, la responsabilité et la possible sanction est renouvelé, renforcé. La norme équipée par l'outil vient repréciser les territoires d'auteur-autorité et contrer les écritures qui pouvaient traverser les frontières pour assurer des traductions Ces traductions étaient justifiées parce qu'elles facilitaient les pratiques de soins. Mais dès lors qu'elles contreviennent à la norme, elles ne sont plus autorisées. C'est le cas d'un élément du dossier patient qui a été exclu de la version informatisé et dont nous suivrons les transformations. Conclusion : Des traces signées aux textes sans auteur [...] . une promesse non tenue de toute puissance de la norme L'informatisation est présentée telle une garantie contre les ruptures dans l'autorité, et dans les traces mobilisables en cas de sanctions pour faire état des responsabilités. L'outil se voit attribuer un caractère magique de toute puissance, qui lui permettrait de tracer qui a fait quoi à quel moment et où. Mais les pratiques s'avèrent pour partie échapper à ce filet aux mailles pourtant étroitement tissées. Le constat est celui de listes diversement administrées, d'un déficit de traçabilité. Le problème que le dispositif technique était censé résoudre resurgit sous une autre forme. Plus encore, c'est la question même du sens du texte global ainsi produit qui est soulevée. Ce texte est fait de multiples contributions locales signées, mais pris dans sa totalité c est un texte sans auteur (Taylor, Van Every, 2011), le produit d une écriture collective (Callon, 2002). Dans ce texte collectif tout est fait pour réindividualiser les parties du texte en les assignant aux individus qui les ont produits. Mais la question des transmissions et du sens global des récits reste sans réponse (Browning, 1992). Tout se passe comme si, en réassignant chacun aux limites de son territoire, ce qui faisait traduction et mise en récit ne trouvait plus place dans le dossier officiel et devait chercher de nouvelles formes d'expression, au travers d'inscriptions non autorisées ou d'échanges oraux, échappant ainsi à la traçabilité exhaustive qui justifiait l'équipement de la norme par un outil supposé omnipotent...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the fifth}} {{of a series of}} reports from the {{research}} program Youth Culture in Sweden, FUS. In the first article, Johan Fornäs discusses how concepts such as sphere, space, field and institution may be used in order to understand processes of power and resistance. Specific attention is given to thinkers such as Habermas, Foucalt, Bourdieu and Willis, but Fornäs also discusses more recent feminist theory as well as theories of ethnicity and identity. In the second article, Magdalena Czaplicka analyses young people’s trajectories through the educational system and into the labour market. She focuses on how the choices and opportunities given to youth are structured by factors such as class and gender. Anders Löfgren applies the concepts of life project and arena on identity formation. Through the use of ideas from social theory and cultural geography, he argues that life projects in late modernity, although still grounded in local environments, {{are becoming more and more}} globalised. Mats Lieberg discusses the importance of public spaces for young people’s entrances into adulthood. He also analyses how young people make use of public spaces in their everyday life practices. Bo Reimer discusses the role of the mass media for young people in everyday life. He focuses on how the electronic media have changed social behaviour, and on how young people act – and react – in an environment saturated by the mass media. Ulf Boëthius discusses youth, popular culture and media through the use of the concept of moral panics. In an historical overview, he shows how the concept may be applied to a number of heated debates and conflicts <b>centrered</b> around youth and popular culture that have taken place during the latest century. He also discusses whether such panics still are possible in late modernity. Finally, Thomas Ziehe analyses the effects of modernization and rationalization in the spheres of education and science. He specifically focuses on the self-reflexivity which he argues cannot be avoided anywhere in late modernity...|$|R
5000|$|By 1978 a {{group of}} people <b>centrered</b> around a female member, one Um Sooin (born 1941), within the Witnesses of Jesus Church of God, claimed through a chain of scriptual eisegesis that they {{published}} in writing, that Um variously was [...] "the only bride", [...] "the Heavenly Jerusalem", [...] "the New Jerusalem" [...] on earth, [...] "the comforter sent by God", and they asserted that she was [...] "our mother who has come down from Heaven", and that Ahn was Christ. Um and the group around her claiming she was the spiritual mother were expelled from the church, and Ahn dedicated a book entitled Problems with the New Jerusalem, the Bride and Women's Veils (1980, reprinted 1983) to the controversy, in which he writes: This booklet was published to prevent troublemakers who misinterpret and behave fanatically, and explain the errors in the books that Um Sooin published ... women like Um Sooin have caused a great problem to arise with her corrupt ideas ... The Jerusalem in Heaven is Our Mother ... Um Sooin speaks as if she is out of her mind when she claims that the New Jerusalem is herself ... they assert that Um Sooin is our mother who has come down from Heaven. ... How extremely scandalous is this? With this type of misguided delusion, she has become a false prophet and has attempted to gain power. ... The New Jerusalem which is written of in ... is a spiritual building not a person. .... Nobody except someone who is not in their right state of mind can believe and follow after this. ... Because the interpretation of Um Sooin was made to match their claims, they have made these ridiculous interpretations. ... Ahn Sahng-hong, Problems with the New Jerusalem, the Bride and Women's Veils, 1980 & 1983 Ahn concludes his rebuking of Um Sooin: There is never a time when the activity of Satan is cut off in the true Church. The Apostle Paul has written as follows that the Devil will utilize women to cause confusion inside the Church:"A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner."In other words, whenever a woman makes assertions in the Church, the Church will fall under the deception of the Devil.
