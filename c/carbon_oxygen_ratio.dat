40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} reported here is the development of a methodology for the measurement of small scale variations in chemical elements concentrations, in particular of <b>carbon</b> to <b>oxygen</b> <b>ratio.</b> Knowledge of the C/O ratio is of importance to many problems in various fields. Here we single out the application in obtaining important information about the oilfields. The most fundamental reservoir parameters-oil, gas and water content-are critical factors in determining how each oilfield should be developed. It is well established that <b>carbon</b> to <b>oxygen</b> <b>ratio</b> log yields accurate and repeatable data {{that can be used to}} identify and monitor reserves depletion.

It is possible to modify the properties of carbon films in wide range by changing the deposition parameters. One of the key parameters is temperature. Temperature affects the structure of the films and also their characteristics. In this work, carbon films were deposited at different temperatures in atmospheric pressure and in vacuum by using plasma jet and inductively coupled plasma techniques. Temperature’s influence on coating surface morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope. The results of microscopy analysis revealed that increase in temperature resulted in more porous surface of carbon films deposited by plasma jet technique. Surface roughness of coating deposited in vacuum also increased when temperature increased. X–ray energy dispersive spectroscopy showed that raise in temperature caused the decrease of <b>oxygen</b> concentration in <b>carbon</b> films. <b>Carbon</b> to <b>oxygen</b> <b>ratio</b> in plasma sprayed coatings increased from 3, 1 to 7, 3 when temperature increased from ~ 1000 oC to ~ 1150 oC.

The <b>carbon</b> and <b>oxygen</b> isotopic {{compositions}} of limestones provide {{criteria for}} the evaluation of the depositional environment. For Jurassic and younger samples, the best discrimination between marine and fresh-water limestones is given by Z parameter, calculated as a linear correlation between δ 13 C and δ 18 O (‰ PDB). Rona Limestone (Upper Paleocene- Lower Eocene), outcropping on a small area in NW Transylvania (Meseş area) is a local lacustrine facies. There, it divides Jibou Formation into the Lower Red Member and the Upper Variegated Member, respectively. Recently, a sequence containing a marine nannoplankton assemblage was identified in the base of Rona deposits. The main goal of our study was to characterize, based on the isotopic record, the primary environment of formation of the deposit, as well as that in which some diagenetic processes (the formation of dolomite and of green clay around the siliceous chert nodules) took place. Ten samples representing limestones, dolomitic limestone, marls and the green carbonate-rich clay were studied from petrographical and mineralogical points of view, and the <b>carbon</b> and <b>oxygen</b> isotopic <b>ratios</b> from the carbonate (calcite) component were measured. In conclusion, {{it was found that the}} procedure of extraction of CO 2 we used enabled the discrimination between the isotopic prints of calcite vs. dolomite.
