25|$|When the Secretary lodged {{his formal}} <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{privilege}},</b> he invoked a privilege against revealing military secrets – {{one which is}} well established in the law of evidence.|$|E
25|$|When a <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> against {{revealing}} military secrets is invoked, {{the courts}} {{must decide whether}} the occasion for invoking the privilege is appropriate, and yet do so without jeopardizing the security which the privilege was meant to protect.|$|E
25|$|In this case, {{there was}} a valid <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> under Rule 34; and a {{judgment}} based under Rule 37 on refusal to produce the documents subjected the United States to liability which Congress did not consent by the Federal Tort Claims Act.|$|E
50|$|Many {{commentators}} {{have expressed concern}} that the courts never effectively scrutinize executive <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege.</b> Lacking independent national security expertise, judges frequently defer to the judgment of the executive and never subject executive claims to meaningful scrutiny.|$|R

25|$|When {{the formal}} <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> was {{filed by the}} Secretary, under the {{circumstances}} indicating a reasonable possibility that military secrets were involved, there was a sufficient showing of privilege to cut off further demand for the documents on the showing of necessity for its compulsion that had been made.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Federal Tort Claims Act {{expressly}} {{makes the}} Federal Rules of Civil Procedure applicable to suits against the United States. The judgment {{in this case}} imposed liability upon the Government by operation of Rule 37, for refusal to produce documents under Rule 34. Since Rule 34 compels production only of matters [...] "not privileged," [...] the essential question is {{whether there was a}} valid <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> under the Rule. We hold that there was, and that, therefore, the judgment below subjected the United States to liability on terms to which Congress did not consent by the Tort Claims Act." ...|$|E

2500|$|It is well {{established}} that the President is constitutionally charged with protecting information relating to national security. As the Supreme Court has stated, [...] "the authority to protect such information falls upon the President {{as the head of}} the Executive Branch and as Commander in Chief." [...] The state secrets privilege is not a mere [...] "common law" [...] privilege. Instead the courts have long recognized the privilege has a firm foundation in the Constitution as was noted in United States v. Nixon [...] where the Supreme Court noted the <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> [...] "relates to the effective discharge of the President's powers, it is constitutionally based." ...|$|E

Bear in mind that every <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege,</b> whether that of blood or property is abolished except that of {{the custody of the}} Ka'aba and of supplying water to the pilgrims. Bear in mind that for any one who is slain the blood money is a hundred camels. People of Quraysh, surely God has abolished from you all pride of the time of ignorance and all pride in your ancestry, because all men are descended from Adam, and Adam was made of clay." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{release of}} the {{classified}} documents, new litigation was attempted, {{based in part on}} a complaint that the classified material contained no secret information. Monetary damages were sought as a remedy. The initial new claim was to the Supreme Court for a writ of error in coram nobis, based on the claim that the use of the [...] "secret" [...] label in the original crash report was a fraud on the court. This was an attempt to overturn the settlement agreement of June 1953. This motion was denied on June 23, 2003 in In re Herring. [...] The case was refiled as Herring v. United States in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on October 1, 2003. The trial court found no fraud in the government's <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> in 1953.|$|E
5000|$|On July 17, 2007 Sanchez and Conyers {{notified}} White House Counsel Fred Fielding {{that they}} were considering the executive privilege claims concerning a [...] "subpoena issued on June 13 to Joshua Bolten, White House Chief of Staff, to produce documents." [...] They warned, [...] "If those objections are overruled, you {{should be aware that}} the refusal to produce the documents called for in the subpoena could subject Mr. Bolten to contempt proceedings". The panel ruled the <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> as invalid on a party-line vote of 7-3.|$|R
2500|$|... for compliance, White House counsel Fred Fielding {{argued that}} the subpoenas called for the {{production}} of [...] "extraordinarily sensitive national security information," [...] and he said much of the information—if not all—could be subject to a <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> executive <b>privilege.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Duncan v Cammel Laird, the House of Lords {{held that}} the court could never {{question}} a <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> State <b>privilege,</b> if the privilege was claimed in the proper form. But note the extreme conditions prevailing when this decision was taken.|$|R
2500|$|In 2005, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit {{upheld the}} {{decision}} in the new litigation, in which District Court determined [...] "there was no fraud because the documents, read in their historical context, could have revealed secret information about the equipment being tested on the plane and, on a broader reading, the <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> referred to both the mission and {{the workings of the}} B-29". Even without the broad reading that the claim included secrecy concerning the aircraft itself, the court found it possible that the documents' revelations [...] "that the mission required an 'aircraft capable of dropping bombs' and that the mission required an airplane capable of 'operating at altitudes of 20,000 feet and above'" [...] could have been [...] "seemingly insignificant pieces of information [...] would have been of keen interest to a Soviet spy fifty years ago." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{military}} aircraft {{on a flight}} to test secret electronic equipment crashed, and certain civilian observers aboard were killed. Their widows sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act and moved under Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for production of the Air Force's accident investigation report and statements made by surviving crew members during the investigation. The Secretary of the Air Force filed a formal <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege,</b> stating that the matters were privileged against disclosure under the Air Force regulations issued under R. S. section 161, and that the aircraft and its personnel were [...] "engaged in a highly secret mission." [...] The Judge Advocate General filed an affidavit stating that the material could not be furnished [...] "without seriously hampering national security," [...] but he offered to produce the surviving crew members for examination by the plaintiffs and to permit them to testify as to all matters except those of a [...] "classified nature." [...] In {{the absence of the}} documents which the Air Force failed to produce, the trial court directed a summary judgment for the plaintiffs against the Government. The Appeals Court of the Third Circuit affirmed the decision. The United States appealed to the Supreme Court in certiorari.|$|E
6000|$|Another infamy was to follow. After the arrest, {{and on the}} {{proceedings}} to obtain the assent of the Convention to the trial of Danton and others of its members, one only of their friends {{had the courage to}} rise and demand that they should be heard at the bar. Robespierre burst out in cold rage; he asked whether they had undergone so many heroic sacrifices, counting among them these acts of 'painful severity,' only to fall under the yoke of a band of domineering intriguers; and he cried out impatiently that they would brook no <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege,</b> and suffer no rotten idol. The word was felicitously chosen, for the Convention dreaded to have its independence suspected, and it dreaded this all the more because at this time its independence did not really exist. The vote against Danton was unanimous, {{and the fact that it}} was so is the deepest stain on the fame of this assembly. On the afternoon of the Sixteenth Germinal (April 5, 1794) Paris in amazement and some stupefaction saw the once-dreaded Titan of the Mountain fast bound in the tumbril, and faring towards the sharp-clanging knife. 'I leave it all in a frightful welter,' Danton is reported to have said. 'Not a man of them has an idea of government. Robespierre will follow me; he is dragged down by me. Ah, better be a poor fisherman than meddle with the governing of men!' ...|$|E

50|$|Former President: If {{the former}} President submits a <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> Executive <b>privilege,</b> the Archivist consults with the Attorney General, the Counsel to the President {{and any other}} {{relevant}} Federal agencies. Ultimately, the Archivist decides {{whether or not to}} honor the former President's request to privilege the records. Since only those records approved for release by the incumbent President are examined by the Archivist under this section of the Executive Order, the Archivist does not take this into account when determining whether or not to grant the <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> Executive <b>privilege</b> by a former President. If the Archivist decides to release the records notwithstanding a claim by a former President, he must notify both the incumbent and former Presidents no fewer than 30 days before the records are released.|$|R
5000|$|The {{conceptual}} thread {{running through}} {{many of the}} issues taken on by Turley is that they involve <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> executive <b>privilege.</b> For example, he said, [...] "the president’s <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> executive authority based on Article II would put our system on a slippery slope." [...] He has argued against national security exceptions to fundamental constitutional rights.|$|R
50|$|Whenever a <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{privilege}}</b> is made, {{the person}} making the claim has {{the burden of}} showing that the privilege applies. Therefore, it is generally the withholding party's burden to provide sufficient information on its privilege log to allow the opposing party to assess the <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege,</b> inquire further, or seek in camera review of the withheld documents or other Court involvement, if necessary.|$|E

40|$|The state secrets {{privilege}} is {{a common}} law evidentiary privilege, which enables the government to prevent disclosure of sensitive state secrets in the course <b>of</b> litigation. The <b>privilege</b> has never been clarified by statute. Congress undertook reform efforts in 2008 out of concerns that the Bush administration overreached in its <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> by seeking more dismissals during the pleadings stage, and that courts have not used a uniform standard to assess those claims. This Article considers the modern application <b>of</b> the <b>privilege</b> in Scotland, England, Israel, and India—an analysis that contextualizes both the current use of the U. S. privilege and the efforts at legislative reform. Such comparative analysis is necessary to fully understand the transnational implications of the U. S. application of the state secrets privilege that have recently come to light in litigation involving both the United States and England...|$|R
