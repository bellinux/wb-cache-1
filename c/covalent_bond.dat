5|$|Carboxypeptidase cleaves peptide {{linkages}} during digestion of proteins. A coordinate <b>covalent</b> <b>bond</b> {{is formed}} between the terminal peptide and a C=O group attached to zinc, {{which gives the}} carbon a positive charge. This helps to create a hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme near the zinc, which attracts the non-polar part of the protein being digested.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{oxidation}} {{states can}} occur as Zintl phases, as either free lead anions, as in Ba2Pb, with lead formally being lead(−IV), or in oxygen-sensitive ring-shaped or polyhedral cluster ions {{such as the}} trigonal bipyramidal Pb52− ion, where two lead atoms are lead(−I) and three are lead(0). In such anions, each atom is at a polyhedral vertex and contributes two electrons to each <b>covalent</b> <b>bond</b> along an edge from their sp3 hybrid orbitals, the other two being an external lone pair. They may be made in liquid ammonia via the reduction of lead by sodium.|$|E
5000|$|Bond triangles or van Arkel-Ketelaar triangles (named after Anton Eduard van Arkel and J. A. A. Ketelaar) are triangles used to show {{different}} {{compounds in}} varying degrees of ionic, metallic and <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding.</b> [...] The bond triangle shows that ionic, metallic and <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> are not just particular bonds of a specific type. Rather, bond types are interconnected and different compounds have varying degrees of different bonding character (for example, <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> with significant ionic character are called polar <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds).</b>|$|R
25|$|In the {{molecule}} , the hydrogen atoms share the two electrons via <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding.</b> Covalency is greatest between atoms of similar electronegativities. Thus, <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding</b> {{does not necessarily}} require that the two atoms be of the same elements, only that they be of comparable electronegativity. <b>Covalent</b> <b>bonding</b> that entails sharing of electrons over more than two atoms {{is said to be}} delocalized.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the compounds where a noble gas atom {{is involved in a}} <b>covalent</b> <b>bond,</b> noble gases also form non-covalent compounds. The clathrates, first described in 1949, consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances. The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (noble gas) atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice. For instance, argon, krypton, and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone, but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained. Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon also form clathrate hydrates, where the noble gas is trapped in ice.|$|E
5|$|Kinetic {{measurements}} taken {{under various}} solution conditions or on slightly modified enzymes or substrates often {{shed light on}} this chemical mechanism, as they reveal the rate-determining step or intermediates in the reaction. For example, the breaking of a <b>covalent</b> <b>bond</b> to a hydrogen atom is a common rate-determining step. Which of the possible hydrogen transfers is rate determining can be shown by measuring the kinetic effects of substituting each hydrogen by deuterium, its stable isotope. The rate will change when the critical hydrogen is replaced, due to a primary kinetic isotope effect, which occurs because bonds to deuterium are harder to break than bonds to hydrogen. It is also possible to measure similar effects with other isotope substitutions, such as 13C/12C and 18O/16O, but these effects are more subtle.|$|E
5|$|There {{is another}} {{opportunity}} for tennessine to complete its octet—by forming a <b>covalent</b> <b>bond.</b> Like the halogens, when two tennessine atoms meet {{they are expected}} to form a Ts–Ts bond to give a diatomic molecule. Such molecules are commonly bound via single sigma bonds between the atoms; these are different from pi bonds, which are divided into two parts, each shifted in a direction perpendicular to the line between the atoms, and opposite one another rather than being located directly between the atoms they bind. Sigma bonding has been calculated to show a great antibonding character in the At2 molecule and is not as favorable energetically. Tennessine is predicted to continue the trend; a strong pi character should be seen in the bonding of Ts2. The molecule tennessine chloride (TsCl) is predicted to go further, being bonded with a single pi bond.|$|E

40|$|This review {{summarizes}} {{the use of}} orthogonal dynamic <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> to build functional systems. Dynamic <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> are unique because of their dual nature. They can be as labile as non-covalent interactions or as permanent as <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds,</b> depending on conditions. Examples from nature, reaching from the role of disulfides in protein folding to thioester exchange in polyketide biosynthesis, indicate how dynamic <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> are best used in functional systems. Several synthetic functional systems that employ a single type of dynamic <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> have been reported. Considering that most functional systems make simultaneous use of several types of non-covalent interactions together, one would expect the literature to contain many examples in which different types of dynamic <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> are similarly used in tandem. However, the incorporation of orthogonal dynamic <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> into functional systems is a surprisingly rare and recent development. This review {{summarizes the}} available material comprehensively, covering a remarkably diverse collection of functions. However, probably more revealing than the specific functions addressed is that the questions asked are consistently quite unusual, very demanding and highly original, focusing on molecular systems that can self-sort, self-heal, adapt, exchange, replicate, transcribe, or even walk and “think” (logic gates). This focus on adventurous chemistry {{off the beaten track}} supports the promise that with orthogonal dynamic <b>covalent</b> <b>bonds</b> we can ask questions that otherwise cannot be asked. The broad range of functions and concepts covered should appeal to the supramolecular organic chemist but also to the broader community...|$|R
5|$|The boron {{nitrides}} are {{notable for}} {{the variety of}} structures that they adopt. They exhibit structures analogous to various allotropes of carbon, including graphite, diamond, and nanotubes. In the diamond-like structure, called cubic boron nitride (tradename Borazon), boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbons atoms in diamond, but one in every four B-N bonds {{can be viewed as}} a coordinate <b>covalent</b> <b>bond,</b> wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the Lewis base to a bond to the Lewis acidic boron(III) centre. Cubic boron nitride, among other applications, is used as an abrasive, as it has a hardness comparable with diamond (the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other). In the BN compound analogue of graphite, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), the positively charged boron and negatively charged nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane. Consequently, graphite and h-BN have very different properties, although both are lubricants, as these planes slip past each other easily. However, h-BN is a relatively poor electrical and thermal conductor in the planar directions.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{are known}} to {{eliminate}} three types of damage to their DNA by chemically reversing it. These mechanisms do not require a template, since the types of damage they counteract can occur in {{only one of the}} four bases. Such direct reversal mechanisms are specific to the type of damage incurred and do not involve breakage of the phosphodiester backbone. The formation of pyrimidine dimers upon irradiation with UV light results in an abnormal <b>covalent</b> <b>bond</b> between adjacent pyrimidine bases. The photoreactivation process directly reverses this damage by the action of the enzyme photolyase, whose activation is obligately dependent on energy absorbed from blue/UV light (300–500nm wavelength) to promote catalysis. Photolyase, an old enzyme present in bacteria, fungi, and most animals no longer functions in humans, who instead use nucleotide excision repair to repair damage from UV irradiation. Another type of damage, methylation of guanine bases, is directly reversed by the protein methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT), the bacterial equivalent of which is called ogt. This is an expensive process because each MGMT molecule can be used only once; that is, the reaction is stoichiometric rather than catalytic. A generalized response to methylating agents in bacteria is known as the adaptive response and confers a level of resistance to alkylating agents upon sustained exposure by upregulation of alkylation repair enzymes. The third type of DNA damage reversed by cells is certain methylation of the bases cytosine and adenine.|$|E
5|$|In aqueous solution, the {{alkali metal}} ions form aqua ions of the formula +, where n is the {{solvation}} number. Their coordination numbers and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii. In aqueous solution the water molecules directly {{attached to the}} metal ion are said {{to belong to the}} first coordination sphere, also known as the first, or primary, solvation shell. The bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a dative <b>covalent</b> <b>bond,</b> with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond. Each coordinated water molecule may be attached by hydrogen bonds to other water molecules. The latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere. However, for the alkali metal cations, the second coordination sphere is not well-defined as the +1 charge on the cation is not high enough to polarise the water molecules in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere, producing a more stable entity. The solvation number for Li+ has been experimentally determined to be 4, forming the tetrahedral +: while solvation numbers of 3 to 6 have been found for lithium aqua ions, solvation numbers less than 4 {{may be the result of}} the formation of contact ion pairs, and the higher solvation numbers may be interpreted in terms of water molecules that approach + through a face of the tetrahedron, though molecular dynamic simulations may indicate the existence of an octahedral hexaaqua ion. There are also probably six water molecules in the primary solvation sphere of the sodium ion, forming the octahedral + ion. While it was previously thought that the heavier alkali metals also formed octahedral hexaaqua ions, it has since been found that potassium and rubidium probably form the + and + ions, which have the square antiprismatic structure, and that caesium forms the 12-coordinate + ion.|$|E

25|$|Leigh and {{co-workers}} recently began {{to explore a}} strategy in which template ions could also {{play an active role}} in promoting the crucial final <b>covalent</b> <b>bond</b> forming reaction that captures the interlocked structure (i.e., the metal has a dual function, acting as a template for entwining the precursors and catalyzing <b>covalent</b> <b>bond</b> formation between the reactants).|$|E
25|$|Like {{a single}} <b>covalent</b> <b>bond,</b> double bonds can be {{described}} in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals, except that, unlike a single bond (which consists of a single sigma bond), a carbon–carbon double bond consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond. This double bond is stronger than a single <b>covalent</b> <b>bond</b> (611kJ/mol for C=C vs. 347kJ/mol for C–C) and also shorter, with an average bond length of 1.33 ångströms (133 pm).|$|E
25|$|Depending {{upon what}} {{substances}} are reacting, the reaction rate varies. Acid/base reactions, {{the formation of}} salts, and ion exchange are fast reactions.

30|$|Having linked {{a smaller}} 3 D ES barrier of Al with {{intrinsic}} <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding,</b> we now discuss {{the impacts of}} this link. It is possible to extrinsically modify local degree of <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding.</b> Surfactants {{have been used to}} modify diffusion, as well as nucleation, on surfaces [27, 28]. If a surfactant atom can modify the degree of local <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding,</b> it will change the 3 D ES barrier. For example, the introduction of Si atoms to Cu steps may promote the local sp electronic bonding and thereby the local <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding,</b> but to qualify as a surfactant, the atom (such as Si) also has to float on surfaces. That is, in addition to effects of atomic size and bonding strength, the control of degree of <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding</b> derived from surfactants is a new effect. This new effect may lead to another mechanism of controlling surface morphologies during growth, say by physical vapor deposition. There is a large body of literature reporting Cu nanorods by PVD [2, 3, 19], but none on Al nanorods by PVD without substrate cooling (at least none that we are aware of), consistent with the difference of intrinsic 3 D ES barriers of the two metals. If a surfactant extrinsically promotes local <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding,</b> growing Cu nanorods may turn into thin films. Similarly, if a surfactant extrinsically reduces the degree of local <b>covalent</b> <b>bonding,</b> growing Al thin films may turn into nanorods.|$|R
