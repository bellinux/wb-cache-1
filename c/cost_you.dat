2500|$|The bill {{divided and}} engendered a {{long-term}} {{change in the}} demographic support of both parties. President Johnson realized that supporting this bill would risk losing the South's overwhelming support of the Democratic Party. Both Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Vice President Johnson had pushed for {{the introduction of the}} civil rights legislation. Johnson told Kennedy aide Ted Sorensen that [...] "I know the risks are great and we might lose the South, but those sorts of states may be lost anyway." [...] Senator Richard Russell, Jr. later warned President Johnson that his strong support for the civil rights bill [...] "will not only <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> the South, it will <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> the election". Johnson, however, {{went on to win the}} 1964 election by one of the biggest landslides in American history. The South, which had five states swing Republican in 1964, became a stronghold of the Republican Party by the 1990s.|$|E

[...] The Australian video game talk show Good Games two reviewers gave the game a 7/10 and 7.5/10. Kotaku stated the level designs were unique, providing plenty of choke points in maps and opportunities to flank opponents.|$|E
2500|$|Matthew Empson Welsh (September 15, 1912 – May 28, 1995) was the 41st Governor of Indiana and {{a member}} of the Democratic Party, serving from 1961 to 1965. His term as {{governor}} saw a major increase in statewide taxation, including the first state sales tax, and the passage of several important civil rights bills, making Indiana one of the most friendly states to ethnic and religious minorities at that time. His tax hikes led to a near tax revolt in the state, and people began writing [...] "IndianaLand of Taxes" [...] on their license plates, at entry points into the state, in stores, and other public places. The situation killed any chance he had seeking higher office and earned him the moniker [...] "Sales Tax Matt". Despite numerous reforms and his popularity within the Democratic Party, he was defeated in a decisive when he ran for governor again in 1972. After leaving office, he served as chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party, as a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1964 until 1968, and as a federal commissioner on the International Joint Commission from 1966 until 1970. Throughout his life, Welsh was known for his personal motto, [...] "It doesn't <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> anything to be a gentleman." [...] After his retirement in 1972, he returned to Indianapolis, where he remained until his death in 1995.|$|E

2500|$|Less {{than three}} months after the murder of Smith, Dahmer {{encountered}} a 22-year-old Chicago native named Ernest Miller on the corner of North 27th Street. Miller agreed to accompany Dahmer to his apartment for $50 and further agreed to allow him to listen to his heart and stomach. When Dahmer attempted to perform oral sex upon Miller, he was informed: [...] "That'll <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> extra," [...] whereupon Dahmer gave his intended victim a drink laced with two sleeping pills. On this occasion, however, he had had only two sleeping pills to give his victim; therefore, he killed Miller by slashing his carotid artery with the same knife he used to dissect his victims' bodies. Miller bled to death within minutes. Dahmer then posed the nude body for various suggestive Polaroid photographs before placing the body in his bathtub for dismemberment. Dahmer repeatedly kissed and talked to the severed head while he dismembered the remainder of the body. He wrapped Miller's heart, biceps, and portions of flesh from the legs in plastic bags and placed them in the fridge for later consumption. Dahmer boiled the remaining flesh and organs into a [...] "jelly-like substance" [...] using Soilex, which again enabled him to rinse the flesh off the skeleton, which he intended to retain. To preserve the skeleton, he placed the bones in a light bleach solution for 24hours before allowing them to dry upon a cloth for one week; the severed head was initially placed in the fridge before also being stripped of flesh, then painted and coated with enamel.|$|E
2500|$|Clyde Engle, pinch-hitting for Wood, led {{off with}} an easy fly ball to Fred Snodgrass in center field. [...] Snodgrass dropped the ball, and Engle reached second base. [...] The next day's New York Times {{described}} the play as follows: [...] "And now the ball settles. It is full and fair in the pouch of the padded glove of Snodgrass. But he is too eager to toss it to Murray and it dribbles to the ground." [...] Hooper flied out to deep center—Snodgrass making a fine running catch right after his error—but Engle advanced to third. [...] Yerkes was then inexplicably walked by control expert Mathewson, putting the winning run on base. [...] Tris Speaker, who hit an even [...]300 in the 1912 World Series, lifted a foul popup [...] on the first base side, but first baseman Merkle, [...] pitcher Mathewson, and catcher Meyers allowed the ball to fall untouched in foul territory. Snodgrass later claimed that the Red Sox bench jockeys had disrupted the players' timing. Strangely, Mathewson called for catcher Meyers to take it even though Merkle was closer. [...] Meyers couldn't reach it and it fell to the ground. [...] Speaker then shouted, [...] "Well, you just called for the wrong man and it's gonna <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> the ball game!" [...] Given new life, he singled home Engle {{to tie the game}} 2–2, Yerkes advancing to third. [...] Mathewson walked Lewis intentionally, loading the bases and setting up a force at every base, but the next hitter, Larry Gardner, flied to Devore in right field deep enough for Yerkes to tag up and score, and the Red Sox won the 1912 World Series.|$|E

The looseness came close to cost, by Milan Belić (82') having a good time for guests, like Shaka Bangura in the last minute of normal time the match. Eventually the 1-0 remained until the end of Anorthosis with anxiety to celebrate the victory in a game that could clean it up sooner. MVP: Ricardo Laborde. The Colombian returned several appetite after absence for punishment, with its good performance to seal it with a certain artistic goals and actions. The defense of the Renaissance especially in the first part with anything they could to limit the action of Laborde.|$|E
