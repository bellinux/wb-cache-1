2500|$|It {{has been}} argued that Cosgrave fell into the {{category}} of being a [...] "chairman" [...] rather than a [...] "chief" [...] as far as the day-to-day running of his Government was concerned. He was meticulous in adhering to the implementation of the Fourteen Point Plan on which the National Coalition was elected. Many of his cabinet ministers were greater stars in their own right than he was. To the surprise of many, he appointed Richie Ryan rather than Garret FitzGerald as his Minister for Finance when the Labour Party leader, Brendan Corish, declined the position in 1973. Ryan, a Dublin solicitor, was of typically conservative Fine Gael stock. Nevertheless, Ryan (dubbed [...] "Red Richie" [...] by Fianna Fáil) implemented the Coalition's plans to replace death duties with a range of <b>capital</b> <b>taxes,</b> including Capital Gains Tax and Wealth Tax. Fianna Fáil bitterly opposed these new <b>capital</b> <b>taxes</b> and garnered considerable support from the wealthy and propertied classes as a result that would stand them in good stead in future elections.|$|E

40|$|Often an {{increase}} in the minimum wage is accompanied by a reduction in the <b>capital</b> <b>tax.</b> This paper analyzes the effects of interactions between the minimum wage and the <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> in the general equilibrium framework. The analysis is conducted in an inter-temporal search model in which firms post wages. A (binding) minimum wage provides a lower support for the distribution of wages. The paper finds that the interaction of these two policy instruments significantly modify labor market outcomes and welfare cost. In the presence of a binding minimum wage, a decrease in the <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> leads to {{an increase}} in wage dispersion. In contrast, when it is not binding, a lower <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> may reduce the dispersion in wages.

2500|$|High {{levels of}} {{conspicuous}} consumption {{may be seen}} as socially undesirable on two grounds; firstly, as it is often associated with high relative income, high levels of conspicuous consumption may be an indicator of high levels of income inequality, which may be found intrinsically or instrumentally objectionable; secondly conspicuous consumption differs from other forms of consumption in that the main reason for the purchase of positional goods is not due to the additional direct utility provided by the goods alleged high quality, but rather the social prestige associated with the consumption of that good. One downside of this search for status is that individual purchases of positional goods may at a social level be self-defeating due to external effects. In this case, the externality is status anxiety, the loss of social status suffered by people whose stock of high-status goods (positional goods) is diminished, in relation to the stocks of other conspicuous consumers, as they increase their consumption of high-status goods and services; effectively, status-seeking is a zero-sum game—by definition, the rise of one person in the social hierarchy can occur only {{at the expense of other}} people. Therefore, the conspicuous consumption of luxury goods and services (positional goods) is an economic loss—like competitive military spending (an arms race), [...] wherein each country must match the military expenditures of other countries in the arms race, or suffer a loss of relative military power. In the case of conspicuous consumption, taxes upon luxury goods diminish societal expenditures on high-status goods, by rendering them more expensive than non-positional goods. In this sense, luxury taxes can be seen as a market failure correcting [...] Pigovian tax—with an apparent negative deadweight loss, these taxes are a [...] more efficient mechanism for increasing revenue than 'distorting' labour or <b>capital</b> <b>taxes.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In November 1970, 3,000 {{scholarships}} were {{allocated to}} Mapuche children {{in an effort}} to integrate the Indian minority into the educational system, payment of pensions and grants was resumed, an emergency plan providing for the construction of 120,000 residential buildings was launched, all part-time workers were granted rights to social security, a proposed electricity price increase was withdrawn, diplomatic relations were restored with Cuba, and political prisoners were granted an amnesty. In December that same year, bread prices were fixed, 55,000 volunteers were sent to the south of the country to teach writing and reading skills and provide medical attention to a sector of the population that had previously been ignored, a central commission was established to oversee a tri-partite payment plan in which equal place was given to government, employees and employers, and a protocol agreement was signed with the United Centre of Workers which granted workers representational rights on the funding board of the Social Planning Ministry. An obligatory minimum wage for workers of all ages (including apprentices) was established, free milk was introduced for expectant and nursing mothers and for [...] {{children between the ages of}} 7 and 14, free school meals were established, rent reductions were carried out, and the construction of the Santiago subway was rescheduled so as to serve working-class neighbourhoods first. Workers benefited from increases in social security payments, an expanded public works program, and a modification of the wage and salary adjustment mechanism (which had originally been introduced in the Forties to cope with the country’s permanent inflation), while middle-class Chileans benefited from the elimination of taxes on modest incomes and property. In addition, state-sponsored programs distributed free food to the country’s neediest citizens, and in the countryside, peasant councils were established to mobilise agrarian workers and small proprietors. In the government’s first budget (presented to the Chilean congress in November 1970), the minimum taxable income level was raised, removing from the tax pool 35% of those who had paid taxes on earnings in the previous year. In addition, the exemption from general taxation was raised to a level equivalent to twice the minimum wage. Exemptions from <b>capital</b> <b>taxes</b> were also extended, which benefitted 330,000 small proprietors. The extra increases that Frei promised to the armed forces were also fully paid. According to one estimate, purchasing power went up by 28% between October 1970 and July 1971.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} consumer uncertainty on optimal fiscal policy in a model with capital. The consumers lack confidence about the probability model that characterizes the stochastic environment and so apply a max-min operator to their optimization problem.

It is shown analytically that the government, in responding to consumer uncertainty, no longer sets the expected <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> rate exactly equal to zero, {{as is the case}} in the full-confidence benchmark model. However, our numerical results indicate that the government does not diverge far from this value. Even though the <b>capital</b> income <b>tax</b> rate is close to zero in expectation, consumer uncertainty leads the altruistic government to implement a more volatile <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> rate across states.

In this setting, we are able to jointly analyze capital and labor income risk and derive analytical results regarding the optimal taxation of capital. We and that the optimal <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> is positive in the long run if there is only capital income risk.
