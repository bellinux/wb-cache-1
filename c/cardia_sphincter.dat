50|$|Both the {{esophagus}} and duodenum {{are also at}} risk for ulceration. Esophageal ulceration is partially prevented by {{the tone of the}} <b>cardia</b> <b>sphincter</b> to prevent reflux, as well as by saliva, which both washes {{the esophagus}} and contains mucins that can help protect its surface. The duodenum is protected by its motility which removes HCl, glands in its surface that produce mucins, and products from the pancreas, including bicarbonate, to help neutralize the acidity. Most duodenal ulcers occur in foals, and there appears to be an association between duodenal ulcers and enteritis in these animals. Duodenal ulcers may result in inflammation of the duodenum so profound it blocks gastric emptying, which can cause severe gastric ulcers and occasionally esophageal ulcers. Often this must be treated with a gastrojejunostomy, which is a risky procedure.|$|E
50|$|Heller myotomy is a {{surgical}} procedure {{in which the}} muscles of the <b>cardia</b> (lower oesophageal <b>sphincter</b> or LOS) are cut, allowing food and liquids to pass to the stomach. It is used to treat achalasia, a disorder in which the lower oesophageal sphincter fails to relax properly, making it difficult for food and liquids to reach the stomach.|$|R
