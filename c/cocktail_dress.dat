Subsequently, the song starts and Minogue is seen on a diving board, jumping into a pool, presumably dead. Mob members look towards her body in distance, but then look away towards Hauer. She starts singing the track in the pool, gets out of it, and walks towards the mob members who seem disinterested of her presence. The singer undresses herself and throws the dress out of the window, which captures their attention. She subsequently drives in a limousine and puts on accessories whilst the driver takes her to a casino. The artist enters a large room, and plays poker with several members, eventually winning.

According to Hauer, {{no one from the}} set—including the singer, and apart from Avery—knew he was appearing as a cameo. Regarding the on-screen relationship, the singer stated; [...] "In my opinion, the Rutger Hauer character is kind of like a minder or he's in charge of her, although there is that kind of strong sexual tension." [...] The artist wore three outfits in the video—a multi-coloured dress {{at the start of the}} visual, a black dress during her appearance at a casino in Monte Carlo, and a final blue <b>cocktail</b> <b>dress.</b> She had sported an estimated $2 million worth of jewellery and diamonds during filming, with a few security guards having to accompany her on the set.|$|E

In the 2010 extension, Swift bared a spangly, violet mini-dress. Jim Harrington of the San Jose Mercury News believed [...] "Picture to Burn"'s performance on April 11, 2010 [...] at the HP Pavilion in San Jose, California demonstrated how versatile Swift was as a performer, feeling equally at gusto with tender ballads and uptempo rockers.

Miller of The Patriot Ledger said, [...] "She strutted down the catwalk chastising another hapless ex-boyfriend".

[...] "Let me put the Internet at ease: Liz and Jack will never be together." [...] Alec Baldwin was asked if the two characters will ever hook-up, he responded [...] "I sincerely doubt it, and I think the show is better off that way.
