25|$|Neglecting {{electrical}} inefficiency, {{the antenna}} gain {{is equal to}} the directive gain, which is 1.5 (1.76 dBi) for a short dipole, increasing to 1.64 (2.15 dBi) for a half-wave dipole. For a 5/4 wave dipole the gain further increases to about 5.2 dBi, making this length desirable for that reason even though the antenna is then off-resonance. Longer dipoles than that have radiation patterns that are multi-lobed, with poorer gain (unless they are much longer) even along the strongest lobe. Other enhancements to the dipole (such as including a <b>corner</b> <b>reflector</b> or an array of dipoles) can be considered when more substantial directivity is desired. Such antenna designs, although based on the half-wave dipole, generally acquire their own names.|$|E
50|$|<b>Corner</b> <b>reflectors</b> {{have the}} same effect as chaff but are {{physically}} very different. <b>Corner</b> <b>reflectors</b> are many-sided objects that re-radiate radar energy mostly back toward its source.

The satellite is a 685-kg hollow sphere with {{a diameter of}} 2.15 meters, and the surface is covered with 318 mirrors for reflecting sunlight and 1436 <b>corner</b> <b>reflectors</b> for reflecting laser beams. [...] The mirrors are 10x10 inches, and the <b>corner</b> <b>reflectors</b> are one inch in diameter and grouped into 120 laser reflection assemblies.|$|R
2500|$|Short {{radio waves}} reflect from curves and corners {{in a way}} similar to glint from a rounded piece of glass. The most {{reflective}} targets for short wavelengths have 90° angles between the reflective surfaces. [...] A <b>corner</b> <b>reflector</b> consists of three flat surfaces meeting like the inside corner of a box. The structure will reflect waves entering its opening directly back to the source. They are commonly used as radar reflectors to make otherwise difficult-to-detect objects easier to detect. Corner reflectors on boats, for example, make them more detectable to avoid collision or during a rescue. For similar reasons, objects intended to avoid detection will not have inside corners or surfaces and edges perpendicular to likely detection directions, which leads to [...] "odd" [...] looking stealth aircraft. [...] These precautions do not completely eliminate reflection because of diffraction, especially at longer wavelengths. [...] Half wavelength long wires or strips of conducting material, such as chaff, are very reflective but do not direct the scattered energy back toward the source. The extent to which an object reflects or scatters radio waves is called its radar cross section.|$|E

40|$|LARES {{flight unit}} is under {{construction}} and will be launched with the VEGA maiden flight foreseen in 2011. The satellite belongs to the category of laser ranged satellites and as such it is passive. It is covered by Cube <b>Corner</b> <b>Reflectors</b> and will be primarily used to verify the General Relativity effect called Lense-Thirring. Objective of the mission is to measure the effect with a low error that can be reduced with this mission {{at a level of}} 1 %. Due to the different materials used for {{the main body of the}} satellite and consequently predicted higher temperature of LARES satellite with respect to the other laser ranged satellites, it has been considered important to verify experimentally the behaviour of the Cube <b>Corner</b> <b>Reflectors</b> in simulated space environment. Specifically the goal of this experimental test is to check if the Cube <b>Corner</b> <b>Reflectors</b> will be subjected to temperature gradients that could induce deformations affecting the Far Field Diffraction Pattern and consequently could cause degradation of the laser reflected signal from the satellite Cube <b>Corner</b> <b>Reflectors.</b> Copyright © 2010 by the International Astronautical Federation.

These theories allow individual backscattering mechanisms of the dihedral <b>corner</b> <b>reflectors</b> to be identified and provide good agreement with experimental results in the azimuthal plane. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the geometrical and physical theories are discussed in terms of their accuracy, usefulness, and complexity. Numerous comparisons of analytical results with experimental data are presented.

Similarly, in radar interpretation, an object that has multiple reflections from smooth surfaces produces a radar return of greater magnitude than might be expected from the physical size of the object.

40|$|The {{presented}} project {{works on}} {{evaluation of a}} slow landslide of a hill in Doubrava city, Czech republic, using satellite radar interferometry (InSAR). The hill is situated on place endangered by frequent flood activities. Since the hill is covered by a dense vegetation, {{it was necessary to}} utilize existing methods to overcome temporal and other decorrelation effects in processing C-band radar images from Envisat ASAR. The area will be processed by multitemporal InSAR techniques with filtering of radar wave delay through the atmospheric moisture using a GPS meteorology technique. To achieve more steadily reflecting points in five available ASAR images of the year 2010, specially designed <b>corner</b> <b>reflectors</b> were installed in the area of interest. They were mounted on hydrogeological drills every hour before acquisition time and then unmounted back, which is not a standard procedure since the needed radar wave phase is very sensitive to changes in the object position. This paper includes the description of designed <b>corner</b> <b>reflectors</b> together with results, main limitations and problems found of their appearance in the ASAR acquisitions. Possible errors in mounting of the <b>corner</b> <b>reflectors</b> and their turning to the satellite line of sight during sensing are depicted.
