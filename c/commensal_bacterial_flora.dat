40|$|Mutations in the Nod 2 gene {{are among}} the strongest genetic risk factors in the {{pathogenesis}} of ileal Crohn's disease, but the exact contributions of Nod 2 to intestinal mucosal homeostasis are not understood. Here we show that Nod 2 plays {{an essential role in}} controlling <b>commensal</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> in the intestine. Analysis of intestinal bacteria from the terminal ilea of Nod 2 -deficient mice showed that they harbor an increased load of commensal resident bacteria. Furthermore, Nod 2 -deficient mice had a diminished ability to prevent intestinal colonization of pathogenic bacteria. In vitro, intestinal crypts isolated from terminal ilea of Nod 2 -deficient mice were unable to kill bacteria effectively, suggesting an important role of Nod 2 signaling in crypt function. Interestingly, the expression of Nod 2 is dependent on the presence of commensal bacteria, because mice re-derived into germ-free conditions expressed significantly less Nod 2 in their terminal ilea, and complementation of commensal bacteria into germ-free mice induced Nod 2 expression. Therefore, Nod 2 and intestinal <b>commensal</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> maintain a balance by regulating each other through a feedback mechanism. Dysfunction of Nod 2 results in a break-down of this homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a {{multistage}} disease {{resulting from}} complex factors, including genetic mutations, epigenetic changes, chronic inflammation, diet, and lifestyle. Recent accumulating {{evidence suggests that}} the gut microbiota is a new and important player in the development of CRC. Imbalance of the gut microbiota, especially dysregulated gut bacteria, contributes to colon cancer through mechanisms of inflammation, host defense modulations, oxidative stress, and alterations in bacterial-derived metabolism. Gut commensal bacteria are anatomically defined as four populations: luminal commensal bacteria, mucus-resident bacteria, epithelium-resident bacteria, and lymphoid tissue-resident <b>commensal</b> bacteria. The <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> that are harbored in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract vary both longitudinally and cross-sectionally by different anatomical localization.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} to maintain homeostasis of the gut microbiota remains largely unknown despite its {{critical role in}} the body defense. In the intestines of mice with deficiency of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), the absence of hypermutated IgA is partially compensated for by the presence of large amounts of unmutated IgM and normal expression levels of defensins and angiogenins. We show here a predominant and persistent expansion of segmented filamentous bacteria throughout the small intestine of AID–/– mice. Reconstitution of lamina propria IgA production in AID–/– mice recovered the normal composition of gut flora and abolished the local and systemic activation of the immune system. The results indicate that secretions of IgAs rather than innate defense peptides are critical to regulation of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> and that the segmented filamentous bacteria antigens are strong stimuli of the mucosal immune system...|$|E

40|$|The {{resident}} prokaryotic microflora of the mammalian intestine influences diverse homeostatic {{functions of}} the gut, including regulation of cellular growth and immune responses; however, it is unknown how commensal prokaryotic organisms mechanistically influence eukaryotic signaling networks. We have shown that bacterial coculture with intestinal epithelial cells modulates ubiquitin-mediated degradation of important signaling intermediates, including β-catenin and the NF-κB inhibitor IκB-α. Ubiquitination of these proteins {{as well as others}} is catalyzed by the SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase, which itself requires regulated modification of the cullin- 1 subunit by the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD 8. Here we show that epithelia contacted by enteric commensal bacteria in vitro and in vivo rapidly generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Bacterially induced ROS causes oxidative inactivation of the catalytic cysteine residue of Ubc 12, the NEDD 8 -conjugating enzyme, resulting in complete but transient loss of cullin- 1 neddylation and consequent effects on NF-κB and β-catenin signaling. Our results demonstrate that commensal bacteria directly modulate a critical control point of the ubiquitin–proteasome system, and suggest how enteric <b>commensal</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> influences the regulatory pathways of the mammalian intestinal epithelia...|$|E

Neutrophils migrate through the oral mucosa and form nests within the biofilm mass. The cell wall polysaccharide beta-glucan is exposed during mucosal biofilm growth and is more uniformly present on the surface of biofilm organisms invading the oral mucosa. We conclude that C. albicans forms complex mucosal biofilms consisting of both <b>commensal</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> and host components.

40|$|National audienceA rapid {{increase}} {{in the incidence of}} Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in developed countries, the occurrence of Crohn's disease in spouses, and a lack of complete concordance in monozygotic twins are strong arguments for the role of environmental factors in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Research in the field of environmental factors in IBD is based upon epidemiological (geographical and case-control), clinical and experimental studies. The role of two environmental factors has clearly been established in IBD. Smoking is a risk factor for Crohn's disease and a protective factor for ulcerative colitis; appendectomy is a protective factor for ulcerative colitis. Many other environmental factors for IBD have been investigated, including infectious agents, diet, drugs, stress and social status. They are detailed in the present review. Among them, atypical Mycobacteria, oral contraceptives and antibiotics could play a role in Crohn's disease. To date, three hypotheses associate environmental factors with the pathophysiology of IBD (loss of tolerance of intestinal immune system towards <b>commensal</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora)</b> : the hygiene, infection and cold chain hypotheses. Much work remains to be done to identify risk factors for IBD. Research identifying environmental factors that might cause a predisposition to IBD is useful.

40|$|Bacteria of {{the family}} Pasteurellaceae are well known to exist in close {{relationship}} with mammalian hosts, mostly as constituents of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora.</b> However, at the same time, some species also {{have the ability to}} cause serious diseases. For example, Mannheimia haemolytica and Haemophilus somnus cause pneumonia in cattle (15); Pasteurella multocida is a common animal pathogen but occasionally causes meningitis in humans (40, 84); and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, although a commensal inhabitant of the oral cavity in humans, is also the leading agent of juvenile periodontitis (60), and in progressive dental disease, it can cause endocarditis (63). Other Actinobacillus spp., such as A. pleuropneumoniae, A. lignieresii, A. suis, and A. hominis, cause disease in animals. In humans, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Haemophilus influenzae account for about 10 % of the constant flora of the healthy upper respiratory tract, with H. parainfluenzae being more frequent but less pathogenic than H. influenzae. In particular, H. influenzae is capable of causing serious respiratory infections, and until the introduction of conjugative vaccines against the capsule, it was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in young children (53).

30|$|Recovered A. hydrophila, Vibrio spp., S. putrefaciens, Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., and Edwardsiella sp. {{bacteria}} are facultative pathogens or agents of food poisoning, and spoilage is of importance. Although {{the presence of}} these bacteria is not often associated with fish diseases or enteric diseases in man, the health implications of the introduction of these organisms into natural water via the fish faeces in the aquaculture wastewaters should not be ignored. Spoilage bacteria S. putrefaciens and Vibrionaceae are able to utilize trimethylamine oxide, resulting in off odors and flavors (Gennary et al. 1999). In order to prolong the shelf life of fish, it is essential to control these spoilage bacteria. S. putrefaciens count is probably not only a sufficient parameter for shelf life prediction, but is also useful in quality determination of fish. The results indicate that the microflora of the aqueous environment could influence the bacterial flora of apparently healthy carp and catfish and that the <b>commensal</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> which included facultative pathogens could give rise to fish epizootics at any stress condition.

A high dose of STZ (60 mg/kg, i. p.) was injected into Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to induce type I diabetes mellitus (T 1 DM). The diabetic rats were raised in the animal laboratory and at 8 months post-injection of STZ swab samples were taken from the bulbar conjunctiva for cultivation of aerobic bacteria.

In this study we determined the percentage of immunoglobulin-coated bacteria in the stools of patients and controls. METHODS: Faecal samples were obtained from 18 patients with IBD (one sample during exacerbation and one shortly after remission was achieved), 15 healthy volunteers, eight infectious colitis patients, and 13 IBD patients in long-term remission. Bacterial immunoglobulin coating was determined by flow-cytometry analysis. Faecal alpha- 1 -antitrypsin concentrations were determined by radial immune diffusion. RESULTS: IBD patients had 69 +/- 19 % immunoglobulin A (IgA) -, 56 +/- 32 % immunoglobulin G (IgG) - and 56 +/- 29 % immunoglobulin M (IgM) -coated bacteria in their faeces. Healthy controls had less immunoglobulin coating, respectively 36 +/- 12 %, 11 +/- 4 % and 11 +/- 7 %. Infectious colitis patients had 57 +/- 14 % IgA, 31 +/- 13 % IgG, and 42 +/- 16 % IgM; however, they had higher faecal alpha- 1 -antitrypsin concentrations than IBD patients. Shortly after remission, IBD patients had 65 +/- 20 % IgA, 32 +/- 18 % IgG and 40 +/- 21 % IgM. Long-term-remission IBD patients had normal IgG and IgM but increased IgA (50 +/- 16 %) coating. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with IBD had an increased percentage of immunoglobulin-coated faecal anaerobic bacteria, both in active disease and shortly after remission.

40|$|Influenza virus {{neuraminidase}} (NA) cleaves terminal sialic acid residues on oligosaccharide chains {{that are}} receptors for virus binding, thus playing {{an important role}} in the release of virions from infected cells to promote the spread of cell-to-cell infection. In addition, NA plays a role at the initial stage of viral infection in the respiratory tract by degrading hemagglutination inhibitors in body fluid which competitively inhibit receptor binding of the virus. Current first line anti-influenza drugs are viral NA-specific inhibitors, which do not inhibit bacterial neuraminidases. Since neuraminidase producing bacteria have been isolated from oral and upper respiratory <b>commensal</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora,</b> we posited that bacterial neuraminidases could decrease the antiviral effectiveness of NA inhibitor drugs in respiratory organs when viral NA is inhibited. Using in vitro models of infection, we aimed to clarify the effects of bacterial neuraminidases on influenza virus infection in the presence of the NA inhibitor drug zanamivir. We found that zanamivir reduced progeny virus yield to less than 2 % of that in its absence, however the yield was restored almost entirely by the exogenous addition of bacterial neuraminidase from Streptococcus pneumoniae. Furthermore, cell-to-cell infection was severely inhibited by zanamivir but restored by the addition of bacterial neuraminidase. Next we examined the effects of bacterial neuraminidase on hemagglutination inhibition and infectivity neutralization activities of human saliva in the presence of zanamivir. We found that the drug enhanced both inhibitory activities of saliva, while the addition of bacterial neuraminidase diminished this enhancement. Altogether, our results showed that bacterial neuraminidases functioned as the predominant NA when viral NA was inhibited to promote the spread of infection and to inactivate the neutralization activity of saliva. We propose that neuraminidase from bacterial flora in patients may reduce the efficacy of NA inhibitor drugs during influenza virus infection. (295 words) ...|$|E

In general, many of the claims for therapeutic efficacy have not been well substantiated, but the field is now poised for evaluation within the realm of evidence-based medicine. Alterations in <b>commensal</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> within the gastrointestinal tract are associated with susceptibility to pathogens such as Clostridium difficile and there is persuasive evidence that the normal flora may participate in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and other chronic diseases in genetically susceptible individuals. This has prompted various strategies to fortify or otherwise modify the enteric flora by dietary supplements containing probiotic formulations. Detailed comparisons of probiotic performance amongst different bacterial strains have not been performed in vivo in man or under clinical trial conditions, and the level of scientific characterisation of individual organisms has been variable. In addition, it cannot be assumed that the same probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Moreover, the heterogeneity of clinical disorders such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis implies that strain-specific properties may be required for subset-specific categories of patients. While cocktails of probiotics offer convenience, therapeutic progress may require clarification of the mechanism of probiotic action and may be delayed until individual bacterial components have been rigorously studied. More importantly, the full potential of therapeutic manipulation of the enteric flora with probiotics or other strategies may not be optimally realised until the composition and metabolic activities of the normal flora are better understood...|$|E

Little information exists {{on the impact of}} C. albicans on the vaginal <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> in vivo.

40|$|Aerobic <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> of {{eggs and}} larvae of milkfish, Chanos chanos, was investigated. Microflora in the {{incubating}} water of egg, rearing water of larvae, water source, and larval food was also analyzed. Aerobic <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> of milkfish eggs was largely {{influenced by the}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> in the incubating water. Both in eggs and in the incubating water Pseudomonas species were the dominant bacteria. During milkfish larval rearing, intestinal aerobic <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> was examined at days 1, 3, 7, 10, 15, 18, and 21. Bacterial number in the larvae and rearing water significantly increased during the culture period up to day 18 but dropped significant at day 21. Pseudomonas species were detected from yolk-sac larvae (day 1) as the dominant bacteria, similarly to the normal flora in the rearing water. However, intestinal bacteria were predominated with Vibrio species when the yolk-sac was absorbed on day 3. Larval rearing water, water source, and larval food contained predominantly Pseudomonas species...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{bioleaching}} efficiency of arsenic-rich gold concentrates, a mixed <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> had been developed, and the mutation breeding method was adopted to conduct the research. The original mixed <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> had been enrichedin acid mine drainage of Dexing copper mine, Jiangxi Province, China. It was induced by UV (ultraviolet), ultrasonic, and microwave, and their combination mutation. The most efficient <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> after mutation was collected for further bioleaching of arsenic-rich gold concentrates. Results indicated that the <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> after mutation by UV 60 [*]s combined with ultrasonic 10 [*]min had the best oxidation rate of ferrous, the biggest density of cells, and the most activity of total protein. During bioleaching of arsenic-rich gold concentrates, {{the density of the}} mutant bacterial cells reached to 1. 13 × 108 cells/mL at 15 days, more than 10 times compared with that of the original culture. The extraction of iron reached to 95. 7 % after 15 days, increased by 9. 9 % compared with that of the original culture. The extraction of arsenic reached to 92. 6 % after 12 days, which was increased by 46. 1 %. These results suggested that optimum combined mutation could improve leaching ability of the <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> more significantly...|$|R
