25|$|As Habermas argues, in due course, this {{sphere of}} {{rational}} and universalistic politics, free {{from both the}} economy and the State, was destroyed by the same forces that initially established it. This collapse was due to the consumeristic drive that infiltrated society, so citizens became more concerned about consumption than political actions. Furthermore, the growth of capitalistic economy led to an uneven distribution of wealth, thus widening economic polarity. Suddenly the media became a tool of political forces and a medium for advertising rather than the medium from which the public got their information on political matters. This resulted in limiting access to the public sphere and the political control of the public sphere was inevitable for the modern capitalistic forces to operate and thrive in the <b>competitive</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wilson envisioned The Open University {{as a major}} marker in the Labour Party's {{commitment}} to modernising British society. He believed that it would help build a more <b>competitive</b> <b>economy</b> while also promoting greater equality of opportunity and social mobility. The planned utilisation of television and radio to broadcast its courses was also supposed to link The Open University to the technological revolution underway, which Wilson saw as a major ally of his modernization schemes. However, from the start Lee encountered widespread scepticism and even opposition from within and without the Labour Party, including senior officials in the DES; her departmental head Anthony Crosland; the Treasury; Ministerial colleagues, such as Richard Crossman; and commercial broadcasters. The Open University was realized due to Lee's unflagging determination and tenacity in 1965–67, the steadfast support from Wilson, {{and the fact that}} the anticipated costs, as reported to Lee and Wilson by Arnold Goodman, seemed very modest. By the time the actual, much higher costs became apparent, it was too late to scrap the fledgling open university.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Fixed point {{theory is}} an {{important}} branch of modern mathematics and {{has always been a}} major theoretical tool in fields such as differential equations, topology, function analysis, optimal control, economics, and game theory. Its applicability has been increased enormously by the development of simplicial fixed point methods starting in the late 1960 s. These methods have become powerful tools for finding solutions to general systems of nonlinear equations, price equilibria, Nash equilibria, core elements, and so on. In this monograph, new simplicial fixed point methods are developed to solve various new fixed point problems to which the existing methods do not apply. The convergence and performance of the methods are thoroughly studied. The theoretical problems considered range from the stability and refinement of stationary points, through the existence of a continuum of fixed points, the existence of equilibria in <b>competitive</b> <b>economies</b> with several indivisible commodities and money, and the existence of equilibria in <b>competitive</b> <b>economies</b> with production, to the feasibility of integer programs and generalizations of the classical Sperner lemma and KKM lemma. ...|$|R

2500|$|Centralized {{planning}} is inherently undemocratic in Hayek's view, {{because it requires}} [...] "that the will of a small minority be imposed upon the people". The power of these minorities to act by taking money or property in pursuit of centralized goals, destroys the Rule of Law and individual freedoms. Where there is centralized planning, [...] "the individual would more than ever become a mere means, {{to be used by}} the authority in the service of such abstractions as the 'social welfare' or the 'good of the community'". Even the very poor have more personal freedom in an open society than a centrally planned one. [...] "hile the last resort of a <b>competitive</b> <b>economy</b> is the bailiff, the ultimate sanction of a planned economy is the hangman." [...] Socialism is a hypocritical system, because its professed humanitarian goals can only be put into practice by brutal methods [...] "of which most socialists disapprove".

2500|$|Ludwig Erhard (1897–1977) was {{in charge}} of {{economic}} policy as economics director for the British and American occupation zones and was Adenauer's long-time economics minister. Erhard's decision to lift many price controls in 1948 (despite opposition from both the social democratic opposition and Allied authorities), plus his advocacy of free markets, helped set the Federal Republic on its strong growth from wartime devastation. Norbert Walter, a former chief economist at Deutsche Bank, argues that [...] "Germany owes its rapid economic advance after World War II to the system of the Social Market Economy, established by Ludwig Erhard." [...] Erhard was politically less successful when he served as the CDU Chancellor from 1963 until 1966. Erhard followed the concept of a social market economy, and was in close touch with professional economists. Erhard viewed the market itself as social and supported only a minimum of welfare legislation. However, Erhard suffered a series of decisive defeats in his effort to create a free, <b>competitive</b> <b>economy</b> in 1957; he had to compromise on such key issues as the anti-cartel legislation. Thereafter, the West German economy evolved into a conventional west European welfare state.|$|E
