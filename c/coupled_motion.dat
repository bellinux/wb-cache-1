At shear rates larger than the solute diffusion rate, we observe a transition from <b>coupled</b> <b>motion</b> to sliding. Below a critical solute excess, the boundaries {{break away from the}} solute cloud and move in a <b>coupled</b> <b>motion.</b> At smaller shear rates, we observe extrinsic <b>coupled</b> <b>motion</b> at small stresses indicating that the coupling is aided by convective solute diffusion along the boundary.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of}} the network of <b>coupled</b> <b>motions</b> correlated to hydride transfer in dihydrofolate reductase is presented. Hybrid quantum/classical molecular dynamics simulations are combined with a rank correlation analysis method to extract thermally averaged properties that vary along the collective reaction coordinate according to a prescribed target model. <b>Coupled</b> <b>motions</b> correlated to hydride transfer are identified throughout the enzyme. Calculations for wild-type dihydrofolate reductase and a triple mutant, along with the associated single and double mutants, indicate that each enzyme system samples a unique distribution of <b>coupled</b> <b>motions</b> correlated to hydride transfer. These <b>coupled</b> <b>motions</b> provide {{an explanation for the}} experimentally measured nonadditivity effects in the hydride transfer rates for these mutants. This analysis illustrates that mutations distal to the active site can introduce nonlocal structural perturbations and significantly impact the catalytic rate by altering the conformational motions of the entire enzyme and the probability of sampling conformations conducive to the catalyzed reaction...|$|R

[Methods] Thoracic motion of twenty healthy male college students aged 23. 2 ± 3. 1 was examined. The <b>coupled</b> <b>motions</b> of the thoracic regions T 1 – 4, T 4 – 8, T 8 – 12 were measured using a three dimensional motion cap-ture system. [Results] Coupled axial rotation in the same direction as lateral bending was observed in T 1 –T 4 and T 4 –T 8 in the neutral, flexed, and extended postures of the thoracic spine. In T 8 –T 12, coupled axial rotation in the same direction as lateral bending were observed in the neutral and flexed postures, while coupled axial rotation in the opposite direction was observed in an extended posture. [Conclusion] The patterns of <b>coupled</b> <b>motions</b> in the thoracic spine demonstrated some variability between postures and regions in vivo.

The {{objectives}} were {{to show the}} feasibility of a wireless microelectromechanical system inertial measurement unit (MEMS-IMU) to assess the time-domain characteristics of cervical motion that are clinically useful to evaluate cervical spine movement. Methods. Cervical spine movements were measured in 18 subjects with wireless IMUs. All rotation data are presented in the Euler angle system. Amount of <b>coupling</b> <b>motions</b> was evaluated by calculating the average angle ratio and the maximum angle ratio of the <b>coupling</b> <b>motion</b> to the primary motion. Reliability is presented with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Results. Entire time-domain characteristics of cervical motion were measured with developed MEMS-IMU system. Cervical range of <b>motion</b> (CROM) and <b>coupling</b> <b>motion</b> range were measured with high ICCs. The acquired data and calculated parameters had similar tendency with the previous studies. Conclusions. We evaluated cervical motion with economic system using a wireless IMU of high reliability. We could directly measure the three-dimensional cervical motion in degrees in realtime. The characteristics measured by this system may provide a diagnostic basis for structural or functional dysfunction of cervical spine. This system is also useful to demonstrate the effectiveness of any intervention such as conventional medical treatment, and Korean medical treatment, exercise therapy...|$|R

Dynamic motion of two vortex with parallel and antiparallel relative chiralities of curling spins around the vortex cores have been examined after excitation by 1 -ns pulsed external field. With systematic variation in non-magnetic spacer layer thickness from 0 to 20 nm, the coupling between two cores becomes significant as the spacer becomes thinner.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop insight into the lower {{extremity}} joint <b>coupling</b> <b>motions</b> used in the maximal velocity phase of sprint running. Two-dimensional coordinate data were used to derive sagittal plane joint angle profiles of sprint running trials. Intralimb joint <b>coupling</b> <b>motions</b> were examined using a continuous relative phase (CRP) analysis. The knee-ankle (KA) coupling was more out of phase compared with the hip-knee (HK) coupling across the step phase (mean CRP: KA 89. 9 °; HK 34. 2 °) and produced a lower within-athlete CRP variability (VCRP) in stance. Touchdown (TD) produced more out-of-phase motions and a larger VCRP than toe-off. A destabilization of the lower extremity coordination pattern was considered necessary at TD {{to allow for the}} swing-to-stance transition. The key role that the KA joint motion has in the movement patterns used by healthy athletes in the maximal velocity phase of sprint running was highlighted...|$|R

We use {{the concept of}} a motion-system as a convenient abstraction for programming explicitly <b>coupled</b> <b>motions.</b> Motions, treated as processes, can communicate/affect one another through the use of control signals and the dynamics of the system are taken into account during the transitions between different motion states.

Using the simulating approach, {{it is possible for}} us to discuss the effects of the snowboarder (physical strength and mass), the snowboard control (technique and kind of snowboarding), the snowboard (shape and mechanical property), and the slope on the snowboarding turn. The reliability and accuracy of the simulating approach are important for a practical use, and they depend on the reliability and accuracy of the numerical approach for the <b>coupled</b> <b>motion</b> of the snowboard and slope.

40|$|Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen {{that can}} cause potentially lethal hospital-acquired infections. The cellular damage that it causes {{is the result of}} two large clostridial cytotoxins: TcdA and TcdB which act by glucosylating cytosolic G-proteins, mis-regulation of which induces apoptosis. TcdB is a large flexible protein that appears to undergo significant structural rearrangement upon accommodation of its substrates: UDP-glucose and a Rho-family GTPase. To characterize the conformational space of TcdB, we applied normal mode and hinge-region analysis, followed by long-timescale unbiased molecular dynamics. In order to examine the TcdB and RhoA interaction, macromolecular docking and simulation of the TcdB/RhoA complex was performed. Generalized Masked Delaunay analysis of the simulations determined the extent of significant motions. This combination of methods elucidated a wide range of motions within TcdB that are reiterated in both the low-cost normal mode analysis and the extensive MD simulation. Of particular interest are the <b>coupled</b> <b>motions</b> between a peripheral 4 -helix bundle and a small loop in the active site that must rearrange to allow RhoA entry to the catalytic site.

40|$|Objective This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} posture on the range of axial rotation of the thorax and the range {{and direction of the}} coupled lateral flexion. Methods The ranges of mid thoracic axial rotation and coupled lateral flexion were measured in 52 asymptomatic subjects (aged 18 - 43 years) using an optical motion analysis system. To examine the influence of posture on primary and <b>coupled</b> <b>motion,</b> we initiated axial rotation from a neutral sitting posture and from end-range thoracic flexion and extension. Results There was a significant decrease in the range of thoracic rotation in flexion compared with the neutral and extended postures (P <. 001). The mean range of coupled lateral flexion was 8. 9 % of the axial rotation range in the neutral posture and increased to 14. 3 % and 23. 2 % in the extended and flexed postures, respectively. Patterns of <b>coupled</b> <b>motion</b> varied between subjects, but an ipsilateral pattern was more common in the flexed posture, whereas a contralateral pattern was more common in the neutral and extended postures. Conclusions The ranges and patterns of <b>coupled</b> <b>motion</b> of the thorax appear to be strongly influenced by the posture from which the movement is initiated.
