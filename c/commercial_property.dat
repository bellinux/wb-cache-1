5|$|The {{municipal}} government has permitted denser development around the stations, where it wants most new housing and <b>commercial</b> <b>property</b> to be built. Development projects for Slettebakken, Wergeland, Paradis and Lagunen have been announced by private developers.

5|$|In 1917, landowners {{along the}} slough had formed three {{drainage}} districts to control floods. They dug ditches, deepened existing water channels, and built levees {{to keep the}} rivers and the slough from flooding agricultural, industrial, and <b>commercial</b> <b>property.</b> Hoping to flush the slough with clean water from the river, city engineers created the crosscutting Peninsula Canal. The project largely failed because daily tides reversed the slough's flow and because {{both ends of the}} canal were at nearly the same elevation.|$|E

Our estimates show a positive effect of the metro on sale values of both residential and <b>commercial</b> <b>properties,</b> although the effect is stronger for <b>commercial</b> <b>properties.</b> The models also reveal that the effect of the metro on the value of dwellings and <b>commercial</b> <b>properties</b> is largest within 701 to 900 meters of a metro station and is about 13 percent and 76 percent, respectively...|$|R

5|$|The club held an {{architecture}} competition, and received six bids. On 28 September 2005, Start Toppfotball {{announced that they}} had selected the design by Kjell Kosberg from Kosbergs Arkitektkontor, who had previously designed Aker Stadion and Briskeby Arena. The default proposal contained a spectator capacity for 9,948 people, but the plans were scalable, allowing for increased capacity if the club so wanted. Ernst Ravnaas, co-owner of the club, stated that given the recent high attendance, he {{wanted to build a}} larger stadium than the default proposal. Financing was planned with a free lot from Kristiansand Municipality, a NOK40 million loan from the municipality, a NOK20 million grant from Cultiva, a municipal culture fund, NOK20 in value added tax refund, NOK10 to 20 million in naming rights, the sale of <b>commercial</b> <b>property,</b> NOK30 to 40 million in a bank loan, and the remaining with share capital from Start Toppfotball.|$|E
5|$|When a film {{is highly}} exploitable as a <b>commercial</b> <b>property,</b> its {{ancillary}} revenues can dwarf its income from direct film sales. The Lion King earned over $2 billion in box-office and home video sales, but this {{pales in comparison}} to the $6 billion earned at box offices around the world by the stage adaptation. Merchandising can be extremely lucrative too: The Lion King also sold $3 billion of merchandise, while Pixar's Cars—which earned $462 million in theatrical revenues and was only a modest hit by comparison to other Pixar films—generated global merchandise sales of over $8 billion in the five years after its 2006 release. Pixar also had another huge hit with Toy Story 3, which generated almost $10 billion in merchandise retail sales in addition to the $1 billion it earned at the box office.|$|E
5|$|During the story, Tommy meets {{characters}} from various gangs. As the player completes missions for different gangs, fellow gang members will often defend the player, while rival gang members will recognise the player and subsequently shoot on sight. While free roaming the game world, the player may {{engage in activities}} such as a vigilante minigame, a fire fighting activity, and a taxi cab service. Completion of these activities grants the player with context-specific rewards. As Tommy builds his criminal empire, the player may purchase a number of properties distributed across the city, some of which act as additional hideouts where weapons can be collected and vehicles can be stored. There are also a variety of businesses which can be purchased, including a film studio, a taxi company, and several entertainment clubs. Each <b>commercial</b> <b>property</b> {{has a number of}} missions attached to it, such as eliminating competition or stealing equipment; once all missions are complete, the property begins to generate an ongoing income available for the player.|$|E

5|$|In December 2006, HSA sold Briskeby {{to a new}} company, Briskeby Gressbane AS (BG), {{which was}} owned 50 percent each by Ham-Kam and HSA. Another company, Briskeby Eiendom 1 AS (BE1), was {{established}} and owned 66 percent by HSA and 34 percent by BG. The latter was also given 50 percent of the shares in Hamar stadion. BG was non-commercial and was to own the stadium itself, while BE1 was commercial and was to rent out the <b>commercial</b> <b>property.</b> The two shared board, managing director and accountant. In May 2007, NCC was awarded the contract to build the new venue by BG and BE1. Although NCC was NOK8 million {{more expensive than the}} cheapest bid, they offered four months shorter construction time. Briskeby's lot needed to be expanded, which was done by purchasing neighbor lots for NOK34 million. Hamar stadion and the neighbor lot Fuglsetmyra were sold for NOK295 million in June 2007, of which NOK9 million was paid to BG and another NOK175 million was a guarantee which would be paid after the lot was re-regulated.|$|E
5|$|The {{pre-existing}} {{portions of}} the Silver Line, which became the Orange and Blue Lines, opened on July 1, 1977 from Stadium-Armory to Rosslyn, on December 11, 1979 from Rosslyn to Ballston, November 22, 1980 from Stadium-Armory to Addison Road, June 7, 1986 from Ballston-MU through East Falls Church and December 18, 2004 from Addison Road to Largo Town Center. Unlike all prior segments of the Metrorail system, which were designed and constructed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), this line will be designed and constructed by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) and operated by WMATA. The {{first phase of the}} project is funded 43% by $900 million of federal funding, 28% by a special tax district on <b>commercial</b> <b>property</b> proximate to the Silver Line route and 28% by a $0.50 toll increase on the Dulles Toll Road. Funding for {{the second phase of the}} project will be shared by Loudoun County, Fairfax County, the Commonwealth of Virginia and the MWAA.|$|E
5|$|With the {{appearance}} of both Ulysses and T. S. Eliot's poem, The Waste Land, 1922 was a key year {{in the history of}} English-language literary modernism. In Ulysses, Joyce employs stream of consciousness, parody, jokes, and virtually every other literary technique to present his characters. The action of the novel, which takes place in a single day, 16 June 1904, sets the characters and incidents of the Odyssey of Homer in modern Dublin and represents Odysseus (Ulysses), Penelope and Telemachus in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife Molly Bloom and Stephen Dedalus, parodically contrasted with their lofty models. The book explores various areas of Dublin life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Nevertheless, the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city, and Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt, brick by brick, using his work as a model. In order to achieve this level of accuracy, Joyce used the 1904 edition of Thom's Directory—a work that listed the owners and/or tenants of every residential and <b>commercial</b> <b>property</b> in the city. He also bombarded friends still living there with requests for information and clarification.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{the club}} {{stated that they}} would either have to {{renovate}} Aspmyra for NOK200 million or build a new stadium elsewhere to remain competitive at a premiership level. Funding was proposed to be a mix of public and sponsor grants, including DA-funds. As part of the planning of a joint Norwegian and Swedish bid for the Euro 2016, Bodø Municipality and Bodø/Glimt proposed that Bodø could build a stadium at Rønvikjordene, {{in the northern part}} of the town. The plans were presented in late July 2008; the venue was planned to have a capacity for 30,000 to 35,000 spectators, but would be rebuilt after the tournament to seat 10,000 to 15,000. It was estimated that Bodø/Glimt would need a capacity for 10,000 to 15,000 spectators. In comparison, the population of Bodø was 46,049 in 2008. The new venue was estimated to cost NOK500 to 700 million and was largely proposed financed with DA-funds. Minister of Culture, Trond Giske, stated that at least one of the venues would have to be in Northern Norway to receive government support for an application. Aspmyra was planned used as a training pitch. Bodø was discarded for the Scandinavian bid, which ultimately was never sent to UEFA. For Aspmyra, the municipality has stated that they have the long-term option to purchase the real estate north of the pitch and can build a new stand there. Alternatively, an estimated NOK3 million can be used to demolish the stand and redevelop it as a <b>commercial</b> <b>property.</b>|$|E
5|$|Start won the 2012 Norwegian First Division {{and were}} {{promoted}} to the top league for their 2013 season. Start Stadion {{had been involved in}} a legal suit with the Norwegian Tax Administration over whether value added tax was to be paid for the stadium's naming rights. The company lost the case both in Agder Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, resulting in the company having to pay NOK9 million in taxes. As the company did not have such values, it was forced to filed for bankruptcy on 23 May 2013. At the time the company had a debt of NOK107 million. At the time the municipality has commenced negotiations with Sparebanken Sør to purchase the stadium. Football economist Tor Geir Kvinen stated that Sparebanken Sør had by then spent NOK200 million on subsidizing Start and that in reality the municipality and bank were funding the repeated deficits in the club. The municipality announced a plan in October 2013, whereby they would purchase the bank's NOK54 million loan for NOK44 million and receive all the shares in the stadium company. The bank would then buy the naming rights for ten more years for NOK10 million and yet unsold <b>commercial</b> <b>property.</b> The municipality would then be owed NOK64 million by the stadium company, up from NOK46 million.|$|E
