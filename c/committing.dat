40|$|Modern {{software}} is often developed {{over many years}} {{with hundreds of thousands}} of <b>commits.</b> <b>Commit</b> metadata is a rich source of time-based characteristics, including the <b>commit’s</b> time of day and the <b>commit</b> frequency and seniority of its author. The “bugginess” of a <b>commit</b> is also a critical property of that <b>commit.</b> In this paper, we investigate the correlation between a <b>commit’s</b> time-based characteristics and its “bugginess”; such results can be useful for software developers and software engineering researchers. For instance, developers or code reviewers might be well-advised to thoroughly verify <b>commits</b> that {{are more likely to be}} buggy. In this paper, we study the correlation between a <b>commit’s</b> bugginess and the time of day of the <b>commit,</b> the day of week of the <b>commit,</b> the <b>commit</b> frequency and seniority of the <b>commit</b> authors, and whether or not the developers have marked a <b>commit</b> as a “stable” <b>commit.</b> We survey three widely-used open source projects: the Linux kernel, PostgreSQL, and the Xorg server...|$|R
