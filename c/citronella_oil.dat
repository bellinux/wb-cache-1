25|$|Genetic {{engineering}} algae {{has been}} used to increase lipid production or growth rates. Current research in genetic engineering includes either the introduction or removal of enzymes. In 2007 Oswald et al. introduced a monoterpene synthase from sweet basil into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a strain of yeast. This particular monoterpene synthase causes the de novo synthesis of large amounts of geraniol, while also secreting it into the medium. Geraniol is a primary component in rose oil, palmarosa oil, and <b>citronella</b> <b>oil</b> as well as essential oils, making it a viable source of triacylglycerides for biodiesel production.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic {{chemicals}} such as diethyltoluamide (often called DEET) {{dissolved in}} an oily carrier are sometimes used. Also {{there are various}} organic, botanical repellents such as <b>citronella</b> <b>oil</b> and neem oil. Typically various types of synthetic pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and permethrin are formulated in an oil or watery suspension suitable for application direct to the skin of animals at risk. This is usually done with a pour-on applicator along the back line of the host from where the insecticide spreads downwards through the hair coat. In addition, to protect against flies such as Stomoxys and Glossina species that feed on legs and belly the insecticide can be sprayed selectively to those regions. Also cattle can be treated using self-applicators such as back-rubbers made of large bundles of fiber impregnated with the insecticide, or in automatic walk-through sprayers. The same types of insecticides are also formulated into the plastic sheet of ear-tags for protecting cattle against Musca and similar flies feeding around the head of cattle. Insect growth regulators (juvenile hormones, chitin synthesis inhibitors, etc.) are available. For example, the insect growth regulator cyromazine is effective for the prevention or treatment of infestations with blowfly larvae. Botanical extracts such as azadirachtin from the neem tree can be formulated as repellents and insecticides, with the potential advantage of more rapid degradation to harmless forms in the environment, lower toxicity and potentially lower cost.|$|E

40|$|The {{terpenes}} {{constitute an}} important group amongst the naturally occurring organic compounds. They vary greatly {{in nature and}} character and {{a very large number}} of them are still of unknown constitution. An interesting number of these compounds have been termed terpene aliphatic alcohols. They are comparatively small in number and although non-cyclic in nature, they are closely related to cyclic compounds and prone to cyclize under certain conditions.

A brief historical review of the chemistry of the primary aliphatic terpene alcohols, namely, geraniol and citronellol, will be given. The attention attached to these compounds is largely due to their importance in the perfumery trade. Geraniol is a colourless liquid of sweet odour, recalling that of rose and pelargonium.

We found no repellency of D. citri from sweet orange resets that were treated with fir oil dispensers releasing 10. 4 g/day/tree as compared with control plots. However, we found a two-week decrease in populations of D. citri as compared with controls when the deployment rate of these dispensers was doubled.

Thyme oil at 66. 7 μL L− 1 significantly reduced anthracnose from 100 % (untreated control) to 8. 3 % after 4 days, and to 13. 9 % after 6 days in artificially wounded and inoculated ‘Fuerte’ and ‘Hass’ fruit with C. gloeosporioides. GC/MS analysis revealed thymol (53. 19 % RA), menthol (41. 62 % RA) and citronellal (23. 54 % RA) as the dominant compounds in thyme, peppermint and <b>citronella</b> <b>oils</b> respectively. The activities of defence enzymes including chitinase, 1, 3 -β-glucanase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and peroxidase were enhanced by thyme oil (66. 7 μL L− 1) treatment {{and the level of}} total phenolics in thyme oil treated fruit was higher than that in untreated (control) fruit. In addition, the thyme oil (66. 7 μL L− 1) treatment enhanced the antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} are: 1) to determine whether plant essential oil components influence the ability of Escherichia coli and several Pseudomonas species to form biofilms, and inhibit bacterial quorum sensing; 2) to understand the role of autoinducer- 2 (AI- 2) in biofilm formation by E. coli W 3110. The biofilm formation assays determined that cinnamon, cassia and <b>citronella</b> <b>oils</b> differentially affected growth-normalized biofilm formation by E. coli. Cinnamaldehyde (CA) also inhibited the swimming motility of E. coli. Subinhibitory concentrations of CA were effective at inhibiting two types of acyl homoserine lactone (HSL) mediated quorum sensing (QS), and also AI- 2 mediated QS. Because CA is widely used in the food and flavor industries, its potential to affect bacterial QS regulated processes should be recognized. The role of AI- 2 mediated QS expression in physiology of E. coli W 3110 was pleiotropic, including carbon utilization, fimbriae production, and the biofilm development. Overall, the research presented in this dissertation supported the concept that QS, biofilm formation, and cell adhesion may be broadly correlated.

40|$|Introduction: The {{discovery}} of new antimicrobials derived from plants could {{aid in the}} management of biofilm-associated infections, including denture-induced stomatitis (DS). DS is an oral infection caused by Candida biofilms on the surfaces of poorly cleansed dentures. Effective treatment of DS requires the use of an appropriate denture cleanser and preferably one that exhibits antimicrobial properties. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the anti-Candida and anti-biofilm efficacy of two essential plant oils from Cymbopogon winterianus (citronella) and Cinnamon cassia (cinnamon). Materials and methods: Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) and Minimum Fungicidal Concentrations (MFCs) were determined by broth microdilution, whilst anti-biofilm activity was measured against mature (cultured for 72 [*]h) biofilms on acrylic surfaces. Candida cell viability was assessed immediately (0 [*]h) after treatment (T 0) and 48 [*]h after biofilm re-growth (T 48). Biofilm structure was determined using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) at T 0 and T 48. Results: The respective MICs of cinnamon and <b>citronella</b> <b>oils</b> were 65 and 250 [*]μg/ml and these were also the MFC values. For anti-biofilm efficacy, both oils significantly (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) reduced the number of viable micro-organisms and accumulation of biofilms at T 0.

40|$|The {{specific}} biofilm formation (SBF) assay, {{a technique}} based on crystal violet staining, {{was developed to}} locate plant essential oils and their components that affect biofilm formation. SBF analysis determined that cinnamon, cassia, and <b>citronella</b> <b>oils</b> differentially affected growth-normalized biofilm formation by Escherichia coli. Examination of the corresponding essential oil principal components by the SBF assay revealed that cinnamaldehyde decreased biofilm formation compared to biofilms grown in Luria-Bertani broth, eugenol {{did not result in}} a change, and citronellol increased the SBF. To evaluate these results, two microscopy-based assays were employed. First, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to examine E. coli biofilms cultivated in flow cells, which were quantitatively analyzed by COMSTAT, an image analysis program. The overall trend for five parameters that characterize biofilm development corroborated the findings of the SBF assay. Second, the results of an assay measuring growth-normalized adhesion by direct microscopy concurred with the results of the SBF assay and CLSM imaging. Viability staining indicated that there was reduced toxicity of the essential oil components to cells in biofilms compared to the toxicity to planktonic cells but revealed morphological damage to E. coli after cinnamaldehyde exposure. Cinnamaldehyde also inhibited the swimming motility of E. coli. SBF analysis of three Pseudomonas species exposed to cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, or citronellol revealed diverse responses. The SBF assay could be useful as an initial step for finding plant essential oils and their components that affect biofilm formation and structure...|$|R

The use of topical insect repellents is a key recommendation by health authorities to prevent mosquito-borne disease. All products sold in Australia purporting to repel mosquitoes must be registered with the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority.
