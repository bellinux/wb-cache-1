50|$|Numbering and marking {{an object}} (usually with the object's {{accession}} number) {{is part of}} the initial cataloging process, which also includes standard procedures for measuring, photographing, and examining the condition of objects. Marking an object with its accession number (or temporary number if the object will not become part of the permanent collection) is how the object is identified and linked to its documentation. In order to track museum collections, to differentiate between permanent, loan, and subsidiary collections, and to provide access to the documentation of objects in the collection, systematic numbering schemes are used and each unique number is marked or tagged on the objects and prominently noted on all documentation associated with the objects. There are many ways to mark objects with their numbers. Depending on the type of object and desired permanence of the mark, some of the preferred methods include: archival quality paper tags with pencil, barrier coat with ink or paint, adhered labels, labels sewn with <b>cotton</b> <b>tape,</b> Reemay, or Tyvek, pencil directly on object (recommended for paper and photographs mostly), and Bar codes/RFID technology.|$|E
5000|$|The exact {{origins of}} the {{mouthguard}} are unclear. Most evidence indicates {{that the concept of}} a mouthguard was initiated in the sport of boxing. Originally, boxers fashioned rudimentary mouthguards out of <b>cotton,</b> <b>tape,</b> sponge, or small pieces of wood. Boxers clenched the material between their teeth. These boxers had a hard time focusing on the fight and clenching their teeth at the same time. [...] Since these devices proved impractical, Woolf Krause, a British dentist, began to fashion mouthpieces for boxers in 1892. Krause placed strips of a natural rubber resin, gutta-percha, over the maxillary incisors of boxers before they entered the ring. Phillip Krause, Woolf Krause’s son, is often credited with the first reusable mouthpiece. Phillip Krause’s invention was highlighted in a 1921 championship fight between Jack Britton and Ted [...] "Kid" [...] Lewis. Lewis was a school friend of Krauses’ and the first professional to utilize the new technology, then called a ‘gum shield.’ During the fight, Britton’s manager successfully argued that the mouthpiece was an illegal advantage. Philip Krause was an amateur boxer himself and undoubtedly used his own device before 1921.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the persistence of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) in the environment. Virus was impregnated onto two carrier materials (<b>cotton</b> <b>tape</b> and bovine liver) and exposed to environmental conditions on pasture during autumn in New Zealand. Samples were collected after 1, 10, 44 and 91 days and the viability of the virus was determined by oral inoculation of susceptible 11 - to 14 -week-old New Zealand White rabbits. Evidence of RHDV infection was based on clinical and pathological signs and/or seroconversion to RHDV. Virus impregnated on <b>cotton</b> <b>tape</b> was viable at 10 days of exposure but not at 44 days, while in bovine liver it was still viable at 91 days.

Aim: To study the performance of the latex biomembrane as an interface between the raw bone surface and the pack, and to analyze its role in cavity epithelization. Material and Methods: 64 ears of patients submitted to OCTM were studied. The biomembrane was used in the packing of 54 ears and in the 10 remaining ears the regular <b>cotton</b> <b>tape</b> packing was used. Results: In the majority of the cases where the biomembrane was used the packing was removed much easier with no bleeding or pain for the patient and also showed an earlier cavity epithelization.

40|$|We {{report a}} 70 -year-old lady who {{suffered}} from carcinoma of rectum with the lowest border of the tumor at 5 cm from the anal verge. Preoperative staging did not show any distant metastasis. Laparoscopic low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision was performed. The rectum was transected with endoscopic stapler and a double stapling anastomosis with a circular stapler was attempted. The spear of the circular stapler pierced through the rectal stump and attempt to remove the spear by pulling the suture attached to the spear failed. A pair of strong laparoscopic forceps was used {{in an attempt to}} remove the spear. The spear broke during the attempt of removal. The stapler was withdrawn through the anus with a pair of laparoscopic forceps following it. A new circular stapler was used and the tip was tied to a suture and <b>cotton</b> <b>tape.</b> The pair of forceps, which was still at the anus, was used to pull the <b>cotton</b> <b>tape</b> and the suture through the original perforation at the rectal stump.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the impact of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear personal protective equipment (CBRN-PPE) on the ability to secure an endotracheal tube (ETT) with either the Thomas Tube Holder™ or <b>cotton</b> <b>tape</b> tied in a knot. Seventy-five clinicians secured an ETT in a previously intubated manikin with the Thomas Tube Holder™ and <b>cotton</b> <b>tape.</b> A mixed quantitative and qualitative research design was used to gauge actual performance times and perceptions of difficulties. Following completion of the study, 25 clinicians were interviewed to gauge their experiences of securing the ETT with both devices while wearing CBRN-PPE. The mean time to apply the Thomas Tube Holder was 29. 02 seconds, compared with tape which took a mean of 58 seconds (p= 0. 001). Clinicians rated the Thomas Tube Holder as easier to use than tape (Mann-Whitney z= 9. 934; p< 0. 001), which was confirmed during interviews. Of the clinicians interviewed, 92 % perceived that the Thomas Tube Holder provided the better method for securing an ETT, none of the clinicians identified the tape as the best method for securing the endotracheal tube while wearing CBRN-PPE. Clinicians identified that the design of the Thomas Tube Holder facilitated the gross motor movement required for application.

40|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} {{of patients}} in intensive care units is common practice. Artificial airways are utilised to facilitate ventilation and the endotracheal tube (ETT) is most commonly used for this purpose. The ETT must be stabilised to optimise ventilation and avoid displacement or unplanned extubation. Tube movement {{is a major factor}} in causing airway trauma. A destabilised tube can cause fatal complications. A systematic review was conducted to identify and analyse the best available evidence on ETT stabilisation to determine which stabilisation method resulted in reduced tube displacement and the least amount of unplanned or accidental extubations. The types of stabilisations included one or a combination of the following methods: twill or <b>cotton</b> <b>tape,</b> adhesive tape, gauze, or a manufactured device. All relevant randomised controlled and quasi-experimental studies of ETT stabilisation practices, identified through electronic and hand searching, were assessed for inclusion in the study. One published randomised controlled trial and six published quasi-experimental studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were retrieved. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Results of the systematic review showed that no single method of ETT stabilisation could be identified as superior for minimising tube displacement and unplanned or accidental extubations. Rigorous randomised controlled trials with clearly identified and described ETT stabilisation methods are required to establish best practice. In addition, comparative research to evaluate cost effectiveness and nursing time requirements would also be of significant benefit to critical care nursing practice. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Background: Laparoscopic stoma {{formation}} {{has gained}} wide acceptance {{as an alternative}} to open abdominal surgery. Although laparoscopic stoma formation has a low morbidity, complications have been reported. Contributing factors to these complications are twisting of the bowel, maturing the wrong limb, or both of these. In this report, we describe a simple technique that can reduce these complications. Methods: The bowel segment to be exteriorized is grasped with a locking nontraumatic, nonrotating grasper. After the orientation of the bowel is verified, the surgeon ties the handle of the instrument to the trocar by using a <b>cotton</b> umbilical <b>tape.</b> The trocar and the instrument become one working unit, and if the umbilical tape is wrapped around the shaft of the instrument, then the bowel is twisted. It is easy to untwist it by aligning the umbilical tape with the shaft of the instrument. To mature the stoma, the umbilical tape is removed and the grasper is unlocked. Conclusion: Laparoscopic stoma is an effective treatment for several benign and malignant disorders, and in general has a low morbidity. Our report describes a simple technique that can reduce the rare but significant postoperative stoma or small bowel obstruction...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{material}} called [...] "duck tape" [...] {{was long}} strips of plain cotton duck cloth used in making shoes stronger, for decoration on clothing, and for wrapping steel cables or electrical conductors {{to protect them}} from corrosion or wear. For instance, in 1902, steel cables supporting the Manhattan Bridge were first covered in linseed oil then wrapped in duck tape before being laid in place. In the 1910s, certain boots and shoes used canvas duck fabric for the upper or for the insole, and duck tape was sometimes sewn in for reinforcement. In 1936, the US-based Insulated Power Cables Engineers Association specified a wrapping of duck tape as one of many methods used to protect rubber-insulated power cables. In 1942, Gimbel's department store offered venetian blinds that were held together with vertical strips of duck tape.

A superficial wound on the ventrorostral aspect of the lower jaw, contaminated with sand, was found. A slight swelling was present that appeared soft and elastic on palpation. Instability involving {{both sides of the}} mandible was observed. Whole body and skull radiographs in laterolateral and dorsoventral views were obtained. Radiographs revealed a disrupted outline of the Pars horizontalis of the mandible. The fracture line was oblique with a narrow pointed end ventrocaudally and osteolysis was suspected. Based on physical examination and radiographs, a diagnosis of an open, bilateral mandibular fracture and multiple rib fractures as a result of suspected malnutrition and trauma was made. An intraoral plate reaching over all teeth to the corner of the mouth was adapted, and a muzzle made from <b>cotton</b> cloth <b>tape</b> was applied in order to stabilize the fracture. For regular feeding and medication, an oesophagostomy tube was placed on the left lateral neck region. Postoperative treatment included analgesics and antibiotic treatment.
