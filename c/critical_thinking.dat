40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the <b>critical</b> systems <b>thinking</b> (CST) and its {{necessity}} and usability within a commercial company. <b>Critical</b> systems <b>thinking</b> is defined and explained from different perspectives, first as a specific way of approaching a problem, but {{as a tool for}} problem solving as well. The thesis also details the specific skills of <b>critical</b> systems <b>thinking</b> and systems archetypes and identifies some interrelations between CST and a specific commercial company with its needs. The practical part is focused on the process of solving specific problems using <b>critical</b> systems <b>thinking,</b> it also discusses the benefits and limitations and evaluates the overall necessity of CST for a commercial company...|$|R

40|$|Teaching of <b>critical</b> spatial <b>thinking</b> {{in higher}} {{education}} empowers graduates to effectively engage with spatial data. Geographic information systems (GIS) and science are taught to undergraduates across many disciplines; we evaluate how this contributes to <b>critical</b> spatial <b>thinking.</b> The discipline of GIS covers {{the whole process of}} spatial decision-making, but GIS modules often ignore the context setting of spatial problems, and just cover the technical aspects of how to use GIS software. We outline how some existing GIS practicals could be improved to focus on the development of <b>critical</b> spatial <b>thinking</b> skills, competences and abilities that are valuable to graduates. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
5|$|Western civilization {{could only}} be saved, Innis argued, by {{recovering}} the balance between space and time. For him, that meant reinvigorating the oral tradition within universities while freeing {{institutions of higher learning}} from political and commercial pressures. In his essay, A Plea for Time, he suggested that genuine dialogue within universities could produce the <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> necessary to restore the balance between power and knowledge. Then, universities could muster the courage to attack the monopolies that always imperil civilization.|$|E

As juniors and seniors, students engage in the rigorous two-year IB Diploma curriculum that requires a comprehensive study of world topics, literature, languages, science, and math. City College's IB certificate and diploma programs provide upperclassmen access to thirty advanced studies courses, which often translate into credit hours at colleges and universities worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Kubrick {{attended}} William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945. One of {{his classmates}} was Edith Gormezano, later known as the singer Eydie Gorme. Though he joined the school's photographic club, which permitted him to photograph the school's events in their magazine, he was a mediocre student, with a meager 67 grade average. Introverted and shy, Kubrick had a low attendance record, and often skipped school to watch double-feature films. He graduated in 1945, but his poor grades, combined with the demand for college admissions from soldiers returning from the Second World War, eliminated hope of higher education. Later in life, Kubrick spoke disdainfully of his education and of contemporary American schooling as a whole, maintaining that schools were ineffective in stimulating <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> and student interest. His father was disappointed in his son's failure to achieve excellence in school, of which he felt Stanley was fully capable. Jack also encouraged Stanley to read from the former's library at home, {{while at the same}} time permitting Stanley to take up photography as a serious hobby.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to {{introduce}} <b>critical</b> systems <b>thinking</b> into a new emerging research strand: the design of organizational space. The study revealed two things. First, <b>critical</b> systems <b>thinking</b> provides a thorough framework to understand the possibilities to connect organization and building; both in a conceptual understanding of the mutual relations and with regard to the practical implications that such connections have. Second, an application of <b>critical</b> systems <b>thinking</b> in an immersive virtual environment resulted in an inspiring debate around all sorts of facts and values of the current and expected future states of organizational space. It raised the awareness about a true interdisciplinary design in organization and architecture and allowed significant improvements to be made. This paper may be also regarded as an introduction to an application of <b>critical</b> systems <b>thinking</b> in other design processes where human and technical systems designs are interwoven.

40|$|AbstractThe {{increasing}} {{complexity and}} diversity of Information Technologies (IT) adoption in organisations may require a multidisciplinary approach to understand its challenges. This complexity is mainly caused by different stakeholder constituencies with different worldviews the organisations. This paper explores user perceptions on <b>critical</b> systems <b>thinking</b> approaches during IT adoption in organisations. It is based on two case studies. The study results indicate that <b>critical</b> systems <b>thinking</b> approaches may be useful during IT adoption in organisations. The results suggest that <b>critical</b> systems <b>thinking</b> approaches {{have the potential to}} improve IT adoption success in organisations through addressing both technical and social issues. The results also suggest that addressing these issues during IT adoption may result in positive outcomes...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} written to {{accomplish}} two objectives: first, {{to introduce the}} Emery-Trist systems paradigm to the <b>critical</b> systems <b>thinking,</b> a largely neglected and under-utilized paradigm; second using a <b>critical</b> systems <b>thinking</b> framework, to provide a rational justification {{in an attempt to}} track the developments in the ETSP so that an extended heuristic map is offered to the scholars interested in the Emery-Trist systems paradigm. Four tracks within ETSP are identified and analyzed to produce a liberation theme that has not previously been articulated. The liberation theme imminent in all four tracks of the paradigm development denotes the value and the promise of the ETSP to the <b>critical</b> systems <b>thinking</b> community as well as to other systems thinkers. © 1992 Plenum Publishing Corporation...|$|R
