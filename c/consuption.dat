40|$|Issues of material, {{cultural}} and relationship <b>consuption</b> in context of late modern society are being {{discussed in the}} thesis. Differences between {{the social context of}} city and rural areas are used to describe social functions of consumption. At first consumption is defined in sociological terms using the literature. Thesis contains basic theoretical approaches dealing with consumption. Major interest is being put on analytical part of thesis, which shows findings of research. Research is divided into two parts. Qualitative part with data from semi-structured interviews, which are used to create concepts and hypothesis in order to test them in quantitative part with questionners. Research is a case study and findings and interpretations can not be generalized to whole population of young people. Data provide solid empirical conclusion and hypothesis though. My findings support idea of <b>consuption</b> as complex and ambivalent social phenomenon related to individualization process. Yet another social functions of <b>consuption</b> are revealed in thesis. <b>Consuption</b> as a device to define and redefine identity of individual. Normative aspect of consumption, which express itself in social groups norms.

40|$|Combustion of liquids, solids and gases is re-sponsible {{for about}} 80 % {{of the energy}} {{produced}} in the world. Probably, this process will main-tain its importance for many decades. The in-creasing expectation for high eciency and low fuel <b>consuption</b> turns the combustion a eld of study in rapidly expansion [1, 3]. Combustion is a multidisciplinary eld of study. It involves the description of chemical reac-tion (rate of fuel <b>consuption</b> and pollutant for-mation), mass transfer of the chemical species (molecular diusion, convection and turbulent transport), heat transfer by chemical reac-tions (conduction, convection and radiative heat transfer) and ow eld that is in uenced by com-bustion [1, 2]. The goal of this work is the numerical study of a laminar jet diusion ame. The model de-scribes a process of molecular mixture with an one step, irreversible, exothermic chemical reac-tion between two species F (fuel) and O (oxi-dizer). These species react and yield a product P following the scheme vFF + vOO! vPP +heat, where vF; vO and vP are the stoichiometric coef-cients. The reaction is considered of rst order for each reacting specie and the specic reaction rate follows the Arrhenius kinetic [2, 3]. Considering the incompressible regime, several results were obtained. Programs based on the -nite dierence (FDM) and on the nite element (FEM) methods were developed: the last with linear triangular elements, linear rectangular el-ements and quadratic rectangular elements [4]. A direct comparasion of {{the results showed that}} equivalent results were obtained for both FEM and FDM. Now our objective is the numerical study of com-pressible combustion ows.

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we propose a novel {{parallel}} algorithm for frequent itemset mining. The algorithm is based on the filter-stream programming model, in which the frequent itemset mining process is represented as a data flow controlled by a series producer and consumer components (filters), and the data flow (communication) between such filters is made via streams. When production rate matches <b>consuption</b> rate, and communication overhead between producer and consumer filters is minimized, a high degree of asynchrony is achieved. Our algorithm is built on this strategy − it employs an asynchronous candidate generation, and minimizes communication between filters by transfering only the necessary aggregated information. Another nice feature of our algorithm is a look forward approach which accelerates frequent itemset determination. Extensive experimental evaluation comproves the parallel performance and scalability of our algorithm. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{consumer}} {{and the relationship}} between self, identity and <b>consuption</b> practices in light of postmodern theory. The main argument centers around the idea that the postmodern consumer creates meaning in his or her life through consumption and utilizes brands that have acquired cultural meanings through advertising as symbolic resources to form a personal narrative. As the postmodern condition de-centralizes and fragments the self, the consumer tries to form a personal narrative that creates meaning in his or her life. This process results in consuming objects for not only their functional reasons, but also for their symbolic meanings. Thus, the consumer becomes an active audience and interpreter of cultural resources such as brands, and utilizes them for a collection of cultural artifacts which symbolize his or her extended sel...|$|E
