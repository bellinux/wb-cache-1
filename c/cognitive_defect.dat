5000|$|Combining the {{cultural}} theory {{of risk and}} the psychometric paradigm, cultural cognition, its exponents claim, remedies difficulties with each.

They do so, moreover, {{in a manner that}} avoids [...] "functionalism," [...] a criticized form of analysis that identifies group interests, rather than individual ones, as a cause for human action. At the same time cultural theory, by asserting the orienting role of values, explains how the mechanisms featured in the psychometric paradigm can result in differences in risk perception among persons who hold different values.

It is emphasized that the significance of NNPDs in the general disease picture is now underestimated; in this connection their adequate therapy is not performed.

40|$|Mental {{retardation}} in Down syndrome (DS), {{the most}} frequent trisomy in humans, varies from moderate to severe. Several studies both in human and based on mouse models identified some regions of human chromosome 21 (Hsa 21) as linked to cognitive deficits. However, other intervals such as the telomeric region of Hsa 21 {{may contribute to the}} DS phenotype but their role has not yet been investigated in detail. Here we show that the trisomy of the 12 genes, found in the 0. 59 Mb (Abcg 1 -U 2 af 1) Hsa 21 sub-telomeric region, in mice (Ts 1 Yah) produced defects in novel object recognition, open-field and Y-maze tests, similar to other DS models, but induces an improvement of the hippocampal-dependent spatial memory in the Morris water maze along with enhanced and longer lasting long-term potentiation in vivo in the hippocampus. Overall, we demonstrate the contribution of the Abcg 1 -U 2 af 1 genetic region to <b>cognitive</b> <b>defect</b> in working and short-term recognition memory in DS models. Increase in copy number of the Abcg 1 -U 2 af 1 interval leads to an unexpected gain of cognitive function in spatial learning.

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{observed}} that overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) {{is accompanied by a}} persistent <b>cognitive</b> <b>defect,</b> suggesting that HE may not be fully reversible. The health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) {{has been shown to be}} impaired by cirrhosis, and, according to some reports, influenced by minimal HE. Little is known about the effect of previous HE on HRQoL. Aim: To investigate the relative impact of previous HE and minimal HE on HRQoL in a group of consecutively hospitalized cirrhotic patients. Patients/Methods: Seventy five consecutive cirrhotic patients were evaluated using the Psychometric HE Score (PHES) and simplified Psychometric HE Score (SPHES) to detect the presence of minimal HE and using SF- 36 to assess the HRQoL, both corrected for age and education. Eighteen of them had previous bouts of overt HE. Results: Minimal HE was significantly more frequent in patients with previous HE than in those without (p < 0. 001), independently on the method used for the diagnosis (PHES or SPHES). A deeper impairment in several domains of SF- 36 was observed in patients with previous bouts of overt HE, in those with ascites, as well as in those with decompensated cirrhosis. At multivariate analysis, ascites, MELD score and previous HE were independently related to the mental-component-summary (MCS) of SF- 36, whereas ascites was the only variable independently associated with the physical-component-summary (PCS) of SF- 36. Minimal HE (independently on the method used for its diagnosis) impaired only one domain of SF- 36. Conclusions: These data suggest that previous bouts of HE, despite their complete clinical resolution, play an independent role in producing a persistent impairment in HRQoL of cirrhotics...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Thy- 1 {{is a major}} cell-surface {{glycoprotein}} {{of mature}} neurons and certain other cells, {{including those of the}} lymphoreticular system. Despite being the simplest member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, the biological role of Thy- 1 has proved elusive. Analysis of Thy- 1 null mice has shown the presence of excessive GABAergic inhibition of neurotransmission in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation selectively, without any neurological or behavioural effects being apparent. Results: We show here that Thy- 1 null mice are unable to make the appropriate dietary choice in the test for social transmission of food preference, despite showing a normal level of social interaction with the demonstrator mouse, normal neophobia, and normal learning in a T-maze using scented food as cues. The mice also performed normally in tests of anxiety, locomotor activity, exploration of a novel environment, habituation to novelty and spatial learning. This phenotype is maintained on two different strain backgrounds, is rescued by transgenic expression of Thy- 1 and by administration of the GABAA receptor antagonist pentylenetetrazole. Conclusions: The test for social transmission of food preference is based on the normal ability of mice in a colony to learn from each other which foods are safe to eat. The lack of this key survival behaviour in Thy- 1 null mice could act as an evolutionary pressure point to conserve expression of Thy- 1. Furthermore, the specific <b>cognitive</b> <b>defect</b> caused by inactivation of the Thy- 1 gene suggests that it would be worthwhile to determine the role of Thy- 1 in certain human familial forms of mental retardation that map to chromosome 11 q 22 - 23 in the region of the Thy- 1 locus rather than the nearby ataxia telangiectasia locus...|$|E
40|$|In {{the brain}} of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, {{neurotoxic}} amyloid peptides accumulate and are deposited as senile plaques. A major therapeutic strategy aims to decrease production of amyloid peptides by inhibition of gamma-secretase. Presenilins are polytopic transmembrane proteins that are essential for gamma-secretase activity during development and in amyloid production. By loxP/Cre-recombinase-mediated deletion, we generated mice with postnatal, neuron-specific presenilin- 1 (PS 1) deficiency, denoted PS 1 (n-/-), that were viable and fertile, with normal brain morphology. In adult PS 1 (n-/-) mice, levels of endogenous brain amyloid peptides were strongly decreased, concomitant with accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) C-terminal fragments. In the cross of APP[V 717 I]xPS 1 (n-/-) double transgenic mice, the neuronal absence of PS 1 effectively prevented amyloid pathology, even in mice that were 18 months old. This contrasted sharply with APP[V 717 I] single transgenic mice that all develop amyloid pathology {{at the age of}} 10 - 12 months. In APP[V 717 I]xPS 1 (n-/-) mice, long-term potentiation (LTP) was practically rescued {{at the end of the}} 2 hr observation period, again contrasting sharply with the strongly impaired LTP in APP[V 717 I] mice. The findings demonstrate the critical involvement of amyloid peptides in defective LTP in APP transgenic mice. Although these data open perspectives for therapy of AD by gamma-secretase inhibition, the neuronal absence of PS 1 failed to rescue the <b>cognitive</b> <b>defect,</b> assessed by the object recognition test, of the parent APP[V 717 I] transgenic mice. This points to potentially detrimental effects of accumulating APP C 99 fragments and demands further study of the consequences of inhibition of gamma-secretase activity.

40|$|Wernicke-Korsakoff {{syndrome}} (WKS) is {{a life-threatening}} neuropsychiatric disorder caused by thiamine (vitamin B 1) deficiency. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome {{is associated with}} mammillary body edema and small vessel ischemia. Many patients who develop WKS {{have a history of}} serious alcoholism and self-neglect. It is a common condition as around 15 % of the alcoholics show specific WKS neuropathology. Originally, the syndrome was described as a triad of ataxia, eye movement disorders, and mental status change, but recent studies have suggested that patients frequently only show the mental status change [1]. Although it has been known for over 60 years that treatment with high doses of parenteral (intravenous or intramuscular) thiamine replacement therapy has the potency to improve the neuropsychiatric syndrome in the early stage of WKS [2], this is still uncommon medical practice. Recently published studies on treatment perspectives of WKS in general and psychiatric hospitals are alarming: European as well as American studies demonstrated that most patients did not receive thiamine at all or only received it orally in low doses [3] and [4]. Both types of treatment lead to unnecessary cases of chronic WKS (also Korsakoff's syndrome) characterized by severe amnesia and lifelong impaired autonomy [4]. Based on the currently available literature, we suggest that any sign of mental confusion, <b>cognitive</b> <b>defect,</b> or change in mobility in an admitted alcoholic should alarm a clinician for treatable WKS. Parenteral thiamine replacement therapy is well tolerated and regularly ameliorates neuropathology in WKS. According to the European Federation of Neurological Societies and the Royal College of Physicians, parenteral thiamine should be given 200 mg up to 500 mg 3 times daily until symptoms of acute WKS resolute [5]. Importantly, in many cases, the benefit of treating WKS outweighs the risks of treating unnecessarily. The treatment is lifesaving and has the potential to reverse this acute neuropsychiatric syndrome. It is recommended to have a high suspicion of WKS in alcoholic patients and preventively treat them as such...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Many {{dyslexic}} {{children are}} unable accurately {{to control the}} movements of their eyes {{even when they are}} not trying to read. This immaturity helps to explain their visual confusions. It may result from failure to develop dependable associations between retinal and ocular motor signals. These are essential to fix the true, as opposed to retinotopic, locations of objects in the outside world. We have used a new test to study retinal/ocular motor correspondence in dyslexic children and age/IQ matched normal readers. motor dominance. The idea that developmental dyslexia is ever the result of a primary visual disorder is not at present popular because conventional tests rarely reveal any disorder of a dyslexic's eyesight, while thousands of children with profoundly abnormnal vision neverthe-less learn to read successfully. Dyslexia is generally held to be a general <b>cognitive</b> <b>defect</b> rather than a perceptual one. ' Dyslexia is, however, often associated with abnormal movements of the eyes. 23 Although many people suggest that these are merely a consequence rather than a cause of reading difficulties, perhaps arising from children's inability to make sense ofwhat they see, 4 {{it is now clear that}} many dyslexics have unusual eye movements even when they are not trying to read. They are more likely than normal readers to show esophoria, 5 convergence insufficiency, 6 breakdown to saccadic jerks (cogwheeling) during attempts at smooth pursuit, 7 excessive numbers of regressions, and inability to maintain stable fixation when viewing sequentially illuminated light-emitting diodes. 8 These eye movement disorders may help to explain a child's difficulties with learning to read. Reading demands highly accurate ocular motor control, together with precise monitoring of eye position, since this is essential to determine true visual direction. When we look at a letter we can estimate its true position in space only if we know the exact angle of our gaze. The positions of the images of the lette...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Elderly {{patients}} {{have a long}} list of differentials for causes of acute confusion and altered consciousness levels, including infectious agents. In addition, elderly, retired patients often have more time to travel for tourism, particularly to exotic, warmer locations. Mediterranean countries such as Spain and Italy are popular holiday destinations for British and other tourists, especially during the winter months. However, these warm climates allow insect vectors to proliferate, increasing the risk of exposure to endemic vectorborne viral infections whilst on vacation. Such infections may not be routinely considered by geriatric medical teams. CASE PRESENTATION: An 87 -year old gentleman presented with a three-day history of worsening confusion, lethargy, ataxia, and fevers following a trip to Spain, where he may have sustained a sandfly bite. By the time of admission, he had a reduced GCS, was hallucinating, and was incontinent of urine and faeces, though blood pressure and heart rate were normal. He also appeared hyperaesthetic, and found even capillary blood sugar testing extremely painful. He had no history of <b>cognitive</b> <b>defect</b> or other neurological conditions. He had been previously independently active, with frequent trips to Spain where he maintained a holiday home. He probably sustained a sandfly bite during this most recent trip, whilst cleaning out a shed. Acute and convalescent sera demonstrated IgG antibodies to Toscana virus at extremely high titres of ≥ 1 : 10, 000 by immunofluorescence assay, though no Toscana virus RNA was detectable in these sera by the time of presentation. CONCLUSIONS: Toscana virus {{should be included in the}} differential diagnosis of any patients presenting with meningo-encephalitis who have recently returned from a Mediterranean country. Testing for Toscana virus infection is performed by serological testing on acute/convalescent paired sera, and/or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay on blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) if presenting within 5  days of illness onset. Making a diagnosis of Toscana virus meningitis/encephalitis (where no other pathogen is detected) has additional clinical utility in reducing or preventing unnecessary use of antibiotics, as well as reassuring the patient and family that generally, this illness is generally self-limiting and full recovery within a few weeks is expected, as in the case reported here.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>defects</b> after acute {{acyclovir}} treated {{herpes simplex encephalitis}} with those after other types of acute encephalitis. METHODS: Seventy seven consecutive patients between 1985 and 1995 and 29 normal controls were studied. Of the 77 patients without concomitant neurological conditions, 17 had herpes simplex, one virus encephalitis (HSVE group), 27 had some other identified aetiology (non-HSVE group), and in 33 patients the cause was unknown. Acyclovir treatment was started less than {{four days after the}} first mental symptoms in 12 of 17 patients with HSVE. A thorough neuropsychological assessment was carried out about one month after the onset. RESULTS: The HSVE group had deficits in verbal memory, verbal-semantic functions, and visuoperceptual functions more often than the non-HSVE group. The risk for <b>cognitive</b> <b>defects</b> was twofold to four-fold in the patients with HSVE compared with the non-HSVE patients. Two (12 %) of the patients with HSVE and 12 (44 %) of the non-HSVE patients were cognitively intact. Six patients with HSVE (46 %) and 17 (89 %) non-HSVE patients later returned to work. The lesions on CT or MRI were bilateral only in one patient with HSVE. The defects in the three patients with adenovirus infection were severe and resembled the amnesia after HSVE. Cognitive impairment, not previously reported, was found in encephalitis after rotavirus infection and epidemic nephropathy.
