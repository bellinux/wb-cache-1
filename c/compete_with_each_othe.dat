40|$|Foundation. The {{main goal}} of this two-semester course {{is to provide a}} {{friendly}} atmosphere to students to ease their transition into college life, learn about the department, and make friends with peers and seniors within the department. The ultimate objective is to provide better connection with the department to the new students to increase retention. The department head and nine upper-class students, who perform the role of mentors for the new students, facilitate the assembly, which is held once a month during each semester. The mentors also met twice in a semester outside the class with students in their assigned group for a fun activity of their choice, such as bowling, pool, or ice cream social. This activity provides time for further interactions in a relaxed atmosphere. During the assembly several icebreaking interactive activities and discussions on learning styles and myths and realities of being an engineering student are conducted. Other activities include short presentations by student groups and selected industry representatives. The students are also given an on-line questionnaire about the department and a group exercise of meeting their advisor. Teams of students build a robot to perform certain specified tasks from the “Lego MindstormsTM ” kit during the second semester. These teams <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>othe...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{electronic}} and magnetic properties of distorted monoclinic double perovskite Sr 2 CeIrO 6 were examined based on both experiments and first principles density functional theory calculations. From the calculations {{we conclude that}} low spin state Ir 4 5 d 5 forms a rare weakly antiferromagnetic AFM orbital ordered state derived from alternating occupation of slightly mixed c g pi symmetry states {{in the presence of}} spin orbit coupling SOC. This orbital ordering is caused due to the competition between the comparable strength of Jahn Teller structural distortion and SOC. We found both electron electron correlation and SOC are required to drive the experimentally observed AFM insulating ground state. Electronic structure investigation suggests that this material belongs to the intermediate SOC regime, by comparing our results with the other existing iridates. This single active site double perovskite provides a rare platform with a prototype geometrically frustrated fcc lattice where among the different degrees of freedom i. e., spin, orbital, and lattice SOC, structural distortion, and Coulomb correlation energy scales <b>compete</b> and interact <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>othe...</b>|$|R

40|$|According to Ian Hacking’s Entity Realism, unobservable {{entities}} that scientists carefully manipulate to study other phenomena are real. Although Hacking presents his case in an intuitive, attractive, and persuasive way, his argument remains elusive. I present five possible readings of Hacking’s argument: a no-miracle argument, an indispensability argument, a transcendental argument, a Vichian argument, and a non-argument. I elucidate Hacking’s argument according to each reading, and review their strengths, their weaknesses, and their compatibility <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>othe...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{system of}} weak {{normality}} equations constitutes {{a part in}} the complete system of normality equations. Solutions of each of these two systems of equations are associated with some definite classes of Newtonian dynamical systems in Riemannian manifolds. In this paper for the case of simplest flat Riemannian manifold M = R n with n > 0 3 we show that there exist solutions of weak normality equations that do not solve complete system of normality equations in whole. Hence associated classes of Newtonian dynamical systems do not coincide <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>othe...</b>|$|R
40|$|This book is {{the first}} of a {{continuing}} series of publications, composed of 56 articles written by first year students in the Department of Computing and Maths, in the first 6 weeks of their first semester as part of their assessed work for the Introduction to Computer Science module. The assignment was based on “The Impact on Computers on Everyday Life”. The task was to write an article analysing the impact of advances in computer technology over the last 25 to 30 years on one of the following areas: How people communicate <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>othe...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{describe}} how toddlers at pre-school interact <b>with</b> <b>each</b> other during the free play. The following research-questions have been chosen: In which ways are made visible when toddlers interact <b>with</b> <b>each</b> other during the free play? Which repeated patterns are there in toddler’s interaction <b>with</b> <b>each</b> other? The method that was used was observation. Implementing of observations happened during five days on a pre-school. Observations show that the interaction makes visible in various ways when it comes to toddlers, for example through observing, laughing and using the verbal communication. Repeated patterns that are shown are for example eye contact and smile occurs when toddlers interact <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>othe...</b>|$|R

40|$|Neural {{computation}} How synchronization protects from noise Synchronization {{has long}} {{been identified as a}} pervasive – and intriguing – characteristic of neuronal networks (Singer, 1993; Buzsaki, 2006; Tiesinga et al., 2008). A large number of studies have sought to unveil the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon, from both physiological (Hestrin & Galarreta, 2005; Fukuda et al., 2006) and computational (see for instance Pham & Slotine, 2007, and references therein) viewpoints. In addition, the functional role of synchronization has also attracted considerable interests and debates. In particular, synchronization may be a mechanism to allow distant sites in the brain to communicate and cooperate <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>othe...</b>|$|R
40|$|Patent {{analysis}} on a company level leads to many interesting {{insights into the}} technological strategy of telecommunications manufacturers. European companies are usually focused on telecommunications, whereas Japanese companies put higher emphasis on other fields such as data processing or audiovisual electronics and enter telecommunications from this angle. This might be decisive for the future markets. European companies target European markets and, in the second place, North America. They neglect Japan. US companies are oriented to both the European and the Japanese markets. Japanese patents are chiefly aimed at the US market and, on a lower level, the European.

40|$|In {{stationary}} {{sheet metal}} cutting processes, like guillotining and slitting, the sheet is cut progressively {{from one end}} to the other. This in contrary with transient processes (blanking) where the sheet is cut at once. Where transient shearing processes can be modelled in 2 -D (plain strain or axisymm.), stationary shearing processes have to be modelled in 3 -D. For the calculation of the steady state of the guillotining process a 3 -D finite element model is developed. Also plane strain shearing simulations are performed. The Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method is used for all simulations. The results of both cases are presented and compared <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>othe...</b>|$|R

30|$|In this article, {{we address}} the {{spectrum}} sharing {{problem in a}} cognitive radio environment, which consists of several SUs to <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> other to demand opportunistic spectrum access to a single PU. We formulate this situation as an oligopoly market, where a few firms (i.e., SUs) <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> other in terms of amount of commodity (i.e., the frequency spectrum) supplied to the market (i.e., PU) to gain the greatest profit.|$|R
