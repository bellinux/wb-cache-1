50|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of using aluminum for mullions {{is that its}} modulus of elasticity is about one-third that of steel. This translates to three times more deflection in an aluminum mullion compared to the same steel section under a given load. Building specifications set deflection limits for perpendicular (wind-induced) and in-plane (dead load-induced) deflections. It {{is important to note}} that these deflection limits are not imposed due to strength capacities of the mullions. Rather, they are designed to limit deflection of the glass (which may break under excessive deflection), and to ensure that the glass does not come out of its pocket in the mullion. Deflection limits are also necessary to control movement at the interior of the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall.</b> Building <b>construction</b> may be such that there is a wall located near the mullion, and excessive deflection can cause the mullion to contact the wall and cause damage. Also, if deflection of a wall is quite noticeable, public perception may raise undue concern that the wall is not strong enough.|$|R
40|$|<b>Curtain</b> <b>wall</b> <b>constructions</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} applied facade constructions today. Independently {{attached}} to the primary load bearing structure of the building they protect the building’s interior from external climate conditions and allow great design freedom. With continuously rising requirements in terms of energy savings the constructional principle has reached its limits and strategies for improvement are needed. Incrementally evolved over time it is closely related to the architectural design and building processes. Based on literature research and stakeholder interviews the dissertation maps out the traditional and craftsmanship related facade design and construction process currently employed. In a next step, future challenges for facade constructions to cope with a changing market environment are identified. A facade function tree is developed and the theory of product architecture is applied to create a comparative basis for analysing different historical and contemporary facade products and systems. The function tree as well as the analysis clearly show how the fragmented market structures has influenced contemporary facade construction and leads to extremely modular product architectures. Numerous case studies for a new approach are conducted and summarised in several matrices. The case studies show how different modular and integral constructional strategies can respond to the future challenges. The pros and cons of different facade solutions, their potential for innovation and robustness in terms of market conditions are investigated. The dissertation concludes that a greater diversity of fa. ade types with a more integral construction is needed to meet the sometimes conflicting future challenges. If this can be realised, a greater diversity of more integral design and construction processes will evolve simultaneously. The role of the different stakeholders will change and a new way of educating architects or facade specialists will be required in order to meet the needs of the future building market: Away from a purely application oriented towards a product architecture driven approach, which clearly includes the implications of facade product architecture on the structure of the design and construction process. </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{demonstrates}} how monitoring of construction during a laboratory mock-up {{test was used}} to diagnose proneness to air leakage and to devise improved details. The <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> was built on a moveable, rigid frame that simulates the load-bearing structure. Construction details and components were identical to those used in actual buildings. The frame brings the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> into contact with the test box, ensuring that the wall’s structural supports are not affected. Construction activities were monitored while the measurements included air flow rate versus air pressure difference across the wall, and horizontal deflections of wall mullions and beams. Locations of leakage points were detected using white smoke. The wall showed a density of air flow rate of 1. 5 m 3 m 2 h 1 at a pressure difference of 300 Pa, barely meeting the requirements for EN 12152 classification level A 2. Correlating leakage points with detected construction weaknesses led to remedial actions by the manufacturer. The tests were repeated, revealing an improved air-tightness (density of air flow rate less than 0. 6 m 3 m 2 h 1 at 350 Pa, and 0. 8 m 3 m 2 h 1 when extrapolated to 600 Pa), which meets the requirements for classification level E.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a system to}} handle and install exterior cladding on high-rise buildings. The system is innovative in that the cladding panels are installed from the building’s exterior {{without the use of}} a tower crane or man lift, and without on-floor staging. Accordingly, all work pertaining to the panels effectively is de-coupled from most other construction work going on concurrently on site. This results in flexibility and work that can progress at a fast, continuous pace, thereby also allowing for project schedule acceleration. The paper includes illustrations of the use of this innovative cladding installation system in the process of constructing the 70 -story Trump World Tower in New York City. The system was developed recognizing that tight handoffs between trades may lead to detrimental performance. De-coupling of interacting trades is one step towards implementing a lean construction system.

40|$|This article evaluates ‘simulation’ as a {{contributing}} factor in architectural design. While computers enhance simulation, {{they have yet to}} transform the art of architecture. A partial explanation is found at the extremes of design processes: Gaudí’s Sagrada Família Cathedral of Barcelona is an empiricist’s culminating achievement [...] faith expressed in stone. By contrast, SOM’s Sear’s Tower of Chicago is the modernist monument to rational process [...] (financial) faith engineered in steel and glass. Gaudí employed an understanding of the heritage of stone and masonry to fashion his design while SOM used precise relationships of mathematics and steel. However, the designs in both the Sear’s Tower and Sagrada Família are restricted by the solutions inherent in the methods. In contrast, student designs often have no inherent approach to building. While the solution may appear to be evident, the method must often be invented; this is potentially more costly and complex than the design itself. This issue is not new to computers, but its hyper [...] reality is potentially more complex and disruptive.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> {{system is}} widely used in {{high-rise}} buildings because of its many advantages. With the increasing demands for building energy efficiency, thermal performance has become an important consideration in developing <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> systems. Even though the relative impact of the edge effect becomes more important as the thermal performance of glazing and the frame increases, the percentages of the frame out of the total <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> area have not been considered in evaluating its thermal transmittance. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to evaluate the effect of the frame ratio on the thermal transmittance of the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system. The state of the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> frame ratio is analyzed by investigating recently constructed office buildings. Eight cases of different frame ratios and three types of glazing U-values are selected, and the total thermal transmittance of the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> (Ucw) for each case was calculated by using TRISCO 12. 0 W. This study found that when the higher frame ratio is applied to the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system, the thermal transmittance of <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> is higher. Furthermore, the frame ratio has greater effect on the thermal transmittance of <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> when high performance glazing is applied to the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system. It is recommended that the certificates of a <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system should show the frame ratio that was applied during testing or the accurate Ucw value considering actual frame ratio should be submitted for more reasonable building energy simulation...|$|R
