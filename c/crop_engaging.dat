40|$|This study {{attempts}} to understand institutional water resource management in irrigation schemes and its implication on livelihood activities in two study villages in Kilombero District, Tanzania. Mixed methods research was applied including both {{qualitative and quantitative}} research approaches. Ostrom’s design principles for long-enduring Common-Pool Resources (CPRs) are employed to evaluate irrigation schemes and its implications in smallholder farmers’ livelihoods. Sustainable Livelihood Approach (SLA) is brought from Ellis (2000) to analyze livelihoods and water dependence in the study villages. Design principles and SLA were used to analyze qualitative data and JMP statistical software was used to analyze quantitative data. On-farm activities account for 77 % of the household income in the total sample. Mkula and Msolwa A villages have 81 % and 76 % of on-farm income respectively. Rice and sugarcane are types of crops that constitute the major share of the household incomes. Non-farm (18 %) off-farm activities (3 %) and remittances (2 %) have lower shares in the household income. Higher income families have ten times higher income compared to lower income families. Irrigation schemes yield higher returns compared to rain-fed agriculture. This is linked to water availability and access. Land and water scarcity constrain agricultural activities in the villages. Land and water scarcity are linked to many variables including population growth per time, reduction of river flows, rainfall fluctuations, environmental pressure and similar reasons. Other limiting factors in agricultural activities include insufficient inputs access, inadequacy in farming practices, market infrastructure, lack of capitals, leveling problems in irrigation fields and other factors. Farmers applied various means to cope or adopt changes to secure livelihood outcomes. Capital diversification, renting out or selling properties, cultivating more than one crop, cultivating resilient <b>crops,</b> <b>engage</b> in wage labor, initiating rural trade and similar means are kinds of coping or adopting strategies applied by farmers in the villages. We used an institutional water resource management assessment, following Ostrom’s design principles for long-enduring CPRs evaluation and found inadequacies in clearly assigning boundaries, water rights, fulfilling duties and responsibilities, water monitoring and sanction systems. Failures in institutional water resources arrangements in all levels together with poor irrigation infrastructure caused ineffectiveness in controlling and regulating water in the catchment points and in the distribution systems. However, at the village levels smallholder farmers reported to have a fair decision making process and there were absence of external interference on village affairs regarding water arrangements. Contestations of water use between upstream and downstream were however reported, mostly during water shortage periods (dry seasons, July to November). The contribution of this study in practice {{based on the findings}} is that the State, various agencies, stakeholders, farmers and others should develop special attention to improve and develop irrigation projects in accessible areas because it yields sustainable livelihoods. Irrigation projects have increased productivity and provided much higher profits to the smallholder farmers in the study area. The agricultural sector employs a substantial share of Tanzanian’s population can be transformed and become more productive by improving and developing irrigation projects. This will help to improve rural livelihoods by increasing food security and poverty alleviation. It is also important to find ways to increase land productivity; to produce more with less land, less water and with more environmental focus, so we won’t be the last left living on this planet.

40|$|The Cossack {{community}} constituted one of {{the foundations}} of the tsarist absolutism. At the turn of the 20 th century, there were 11 Cossack military formations within the Russian Empire. Initially, Cossack society was characterized by military democracy and equal ownership of property. However, starting in the mid- 17 th century, the Cossack’s traditional social order was disrupted due to the immigration of new peoples to the Cossack lands {{as well as by the}} growing wealth of the Cossack elites. The Cossacks made their living off lands given to them by the state, enabling them to serve in military units that differed from the regular army. The size and value of the lands given to them varied according to their social position as well as the type of military units in which they served. The Cossacks rejected feudal systems, preferring instead to exist as a separate and isolated minority enjoying the privileges from and protection of the tsarist authorities. Thanks to this, they were able to raise stock, grow <b>crops</b> and <b>engage</b> in trade with the local non-Cossack population. The Enfranchisement Act of 1861 led to a wave of migrants from the other parts of the Russian Empire and the newcomers quickly became dominant in trade and industry, gaining an economic advantage over the Cossacks. At the end of the 19 th century, the tsarist authorities, seeking to gain the support of conservative Cossacks, introduced a series of legal acts to strengthen Cossack dominion over the migrants. These laws resulted in a major socio-economic confl ict in the Cossack lands that greatly impacted the region during the Russian Civil War.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays focusing on aspects of the economic development of the Paraguayan agricultural sector. The first essay assesses the relationship between farm size and productivity. Smaller farms are found to have higher net farm income per hectare than larger farms and to be more technically efficient than larger farms. The second essay attempts to explain the finding that rural Paraguayan households with female landowners have lower net farm income than those without female landowners, controlling for farm size. Households with female heads, female landowners and female farm managers are all found to have distinct agricultural production patterns compared to the corresponding group of males, planting subsistence rather than cash <b>crops</b> and <b>engaging</b> in livestock and dairy production rather than planting crops. Female-headed households have higher land productivity and rates of return on assets than dual-headed households, while those households with female landowners have lower productivity and rates of return. These results indicate that ownership of land is insufficient to ensure women 2 ̆ 7 s welfare: control over land is key. The third essay examines {{the claim that the}} land rental market can be an effective means of redistributing access to if not ownership of, land to the rural poor. The land sales market is also examined. The land rental market in Paraguay 2 ̆ 7 s rural areas is found to be very thin, due at least in part to a lack of available credit for inputs. Renting in substantial amounts of land is found to contribute significantly to household per capita income. From this collection of essays, three conclusions emerge: first, land redistribution is justified on efficiency as well as equity grounds; second, effective control over land is essential to improving the welfare of women; and third, without substantial state intervention to provide credit for inputs, the land rental market will continue to be ineffective at redistributing access to land or alleviating rural poverty. ...|$|R
40|$|The global {{agricultural}} economy is changing. Commodity prices are declining, and producers increasingly supply complex value chains. There is {{growing interest in}} how farmers can benefit from emerging market opportunities. Farmers are encouraged to produce high value <b>crops</b> and <b>engage</b> in value-adding activities such as agro-processing. Farmer organization and collective action are often seen as key factors in enhancing farmers' access to markets. Often too little attention is directed at a) the most appropriate types of organization, b) whether the public and/or private sector is best placed to support their formation, and c) the conditions necessary for ensuring their economic viability. This paper reports on research in Mexico and Central America that explored these issues for commodity maize and high value vegetables respectively. The benefits of farmer organization are more evident in the vegetable sector characterized by high transaction costs associated with market access. The research suggests that farmer organizations established by and directly linked to supermarkets may be more economically sustainable as opposed to organizations supported by non-governmental organizations. However, the most representative vegetable producer organizations in both Honduras and El Salvador include fewer than 5 percent of total horticultural producers. This is due to producer organizations' limited business skills and non-replicable organizational models for linking producers to markets. There is less incentive for maize farmers to organize themselves to access output markets as the transaction costs associated with market access are relatively low: {{there are so many}} buyers and sellers that farmer organizations would have little impact on, for example, prices. The benefits of farmer organization are clearer when it comes to accessing credit, seed, and fertilizer. Farmer organization is a critical factor in making markets work for the poor particularly in high value products, but the role and timing of the substantial public and private investment needed to establish and maintain these organizations is poorly understood.

The thesis finds that a confluence of legal, economic, technological and public policy developments contribute to the concentration of economic and political power in agriculture. This has tangible impacts on the lives of farmers creating a tendency for them to become propertied workers or contractors for major seed companies.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} livelihood {{responses to}} climate variability and other stressors in the Morogoro region in south-eastern Tanzania, with an aim {{to understand the}} implications of these responses to adapting to changing climate in the region in the future. The paper indicates how farmers have responded to draughts by expanding cultivations, reducing fallows, switching <b>crops</b> and <b>engaging</b> in wage employment or in charcoal, timber and brick production. Farmers also frequently migrate on temporary basis to locations which have favourable farming conditions or better access to markets. More permanent migration to towns and cities has also increased. Farming practices and heavy reliance on forest resources have resulted in soil erosion and deforestation which have reduced water retention, increased flooding after rains and reduced water flow between the rains. These environmental changes complicate living with increased climate variability in the future because reduced natural resource base {{may not be able to}} provide the same safety net functions as it currently provides during periods of stress. This would be particularly problematic for those who live in more remote rural villages and who suffer from limited access to markets, public services and utilities. Efforts to reduce vulnerability to increased climate variability in the region would need to safeguard the natural resource base, promote market access and augment human capital. Natural resource base demands attention because its safety net functions are important to large proportions of rural and urban population and because the loss of ecosystem services would increase the exposure of large downstream populations to floods and scarcity of water. The promotion of market participation can provide incentives to diversification and intensification and help reduce dependence on risky agricultural production. Finally, diversification of livelihoods is constrained by deficiencies in physical health, skills and knowledge. Therefore, public spending and programs related to health, education and wellbeing can facilitate diversification in the future.

30|$|Rice is {{the most}} {{important}} cereal crop in Kenya coming third after maize and wheat. It forms a very important diet for a majority of families in Kenya. The demand for rice in Kenya has seen a dramatic increase {{over the last few years}} while production has remained low. This is because rice production has been faced by serious constraints notably plant diseases of which the most devastating is rice blast. Rice blast is known to cause approximately 60 % - 100 % yield losses. It is caused by an Ascomycete fungus called Magnaporthe Oryzae. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of rice blast disease on the livelihood of the local farmers in Greater Mwea region and develop a rice blast disease distribution map using GIS approach. The study methodology employed a questionnaire survey which were subjected to sample population of households in the 7 sections with 70 blocks within Mwea region. The collected data was analysed using SAS Version 9.1. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the household characteristics, the farm characteristics and the farmers’ perceptions of rice blast disease. In the questionnaire, farmers’ response on whether they had been affected by rice blast disease and the total production per acreage was used to develop an attribute table with GPS points. The GPS points were interpolated to create a geographical distribution map of rice blast disease. From the research findings almost all the farmers’ had awareness and knowledge of rice blast disease, 98 % of the farmers interviewed were aware of rice blast disease. Out of the 98 % with knowledge and awareness 76 % have been affected by the disease, while 24 % have never been affected. Farmers attributed rice blast disease to a range of different causes, including excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer, water shortage, lack of proper drainage canal and due to climate change. Majority of the farmers interviewed (72 %) did not engage themselves in any other socio-economic activity even after being affected by the rice blast disease. 15 % opted to growing horticultural <b>crops,</b> 7 % <b>engaged</b> in trading activities while 2 % started livestock raring, wage earning and Boda boda business.|$|R
40|$|Fertility {{building}} {{crops are}} {{a key component of}} organic rotations where they help to provide nitrogen required for optimal crop performance. It is important that rotations and managements are planned which optimise the capture and use of this nitrogen. Some estimates are available of the nitrogen production from fertility building crops, but there was a need to produce a more comprehensive assessment of likely nitrogen fixation, release and availability under different circumstances. Thus the overall aim {{of the study was to}} provide guidelines to enable organic farmers to better estimate the nitrogen supply to a rotation following fertility building crops. This was done by a mix of literature review, empirical measurements, model development and farmer participation. The detailed objectives were: 1. To produce a literature review summarising the current knowledge on N capture and supply and secondary effects (e. g. pest/disease implications) following fertility building <b>crops.</b> 2. To <b>engage</b> the organic farming community to ensure that the most relevant issues were addressed within the project. 3. To produce an advisory leaflet summarising practical advice arising from the literature review. 4. To conduct field experiments to supply supplementary information that was required to develop a model for quantifying N supply from fertility building crops. 5. To develop a model for quantifying N supply from fertility building crops in organic systems. 6. To make on-farm measurements to validate this model. 7. To synthesise this information into practical advice for the industry in the form of a booklet on fertility building crops. The study was split into a number of interlinked work-strands: Literature review, Field experiments, On-farm monitoring, Industry engagement, Fertility building crops (FBC) model, Advisory leaflet and Guidelines booklet. The literature Review (Objective 1) was an essential first activity as it helped to guide the experimental programme (in terms of focus, techniques and approaches), avoided unnecessary replication of experimental work and provided an immediate synthesis of available information for the Industry (see Objective 3). The review also formed the basis of Objectives 5 and 7. Over 1000 references were assessed to produce a summary of the current state of knowledge in the following topic areas: • Nitrogen build-up, release and availability • Crops, pests, diseases and rotational issues The structure of the review exemplifies how the project tried to quantify N supply from fertility building crops, i. e. by separating the management process into N capture and N release. Many factors affect both of these processes. The conclusions that we were able to draw from the large body of work were able to serve three puposes: • Form the basis of advisory literature • Inform the research programme • Inform the FBC model development Industry engagement (Objective 2) was a key component of the study and there was good liaison with the organic farming industry at the beginning and throughout the duration of the project. This liaison was co-ordinated by The Organic Studies Centre at Duchy College in the South West, and by Abacus Organic Services Ltd in the East and North East. Feedback from producers was elicited throughout the project to help ensure that the industry’s requirements were met, notably with respect to trials (Objective 4) and advisory material (Objectives 3 and 7). Some of the farmers were also involved in on-farm monitoring, supplying fields which were used to take measurements of N supply from selected rotations (Objective 6). In all, the project findings were promoted at a total of 20 farmer meetings, and 7 articles were published in the popular press. A key early deliverable from the project was a summary advisory leaflet (Objective 3) based on the literature review. The draft leaflet addressed the main practical issues of fertility building crops and was presented at farmer meetings. Feedback on the leaflet was invited at these meetings and issues raised were addressed in the final version which is available on the project website and as an attachment to this report. The main field experiment (Objective 4) was designed to examine the effect of soil-N status on the quantity of N fixed and the impact on N-fixation of returning plant residues to the growing crop in cutting/mulching managements. The original project was extended with approval from Defra during 2004 to include measurements on the amount of N released following destruction of these legume management plots. As a result of industry feedback (see Objective 2), demonstration plots were also set up to look at novel legumes. The legume management data showed that in terms of fixation, maximum N yield (as measured by N offtake) occurred in the mulched grass/clover sward. But, using the measured data, separate estimates for the effect of mulching on N fixation showed it caused a reduction of between 9 and 61 kg N ha- 1. In the presence of FYM there appears to have been an interaction with mulching which was sufficient to depress N fixation by an amount roughly equal to the amount of N gained from the amendment. Availability of fixed N is also important and the amount of N released following destruction of the experimental swards was assessed by measuring the uptake of nitrogen in the following ryegrass crop. Irrespective of management history, N offtake was higher at the first cut where there had been a history of FYM applications. There was positive relationship between N capture (as measured by N offtake) and total N supply (as measured by SMN and N in crop residues) but the impact of the individual N supply components on this relationship varied between sites and between cuts. Recommendations to organic farmers from this part of the work, are therefore to cut and remove herbage during the fertility building phase. This may be difficult for non-livestock enterprises and care needs to be taken that the mulch does not kill out the receiving crop. Application of organic manures to legumes should also be avoided if the maximum amount of atmospheric N is to be fixed. On-farm monitoring (Objective 6) included measurements of N accumulation (as soil and crop N) and subsequent N supply (as soil N) in 12 commercially farmed fields covering a range of soil types and rotations. The data collected were used in the FBC model (Objective 5) and highlighted the high proportion of nitrogen held within the root component of the fertility building crops. The fertility-building crops model (Objective 5) is a spreadsheet-based calculation system for estimating available N in organic rotations based on N accumulation under fertility building crops, its subsequent release and associated losses. It is based on information from the literature review (Objective 1), other soil nitrogen models, results from the field trials (Objective 4) and on-farm monitoring (Objective 6). It was recognised in the original proposal that it would not be possible within the timescale of the present project to deliver a fully functional and validated model that was suitable for release to the industry. Accordingly, a much-simplified version of the model is presented as a flow diagram in the final deliverable...|$|R
