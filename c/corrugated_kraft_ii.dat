50|$|The {{resulting}} election saw the SPD-Green coalition win a nine-seat {{majority and}} allowed Kraft {{to remain in}} office. Cabinet <b>Kraft</b> <b>II</b> is quite similar to Cabinet Kraft I.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} was {{a coalition government}} of the center-left Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Green party, who formed a minority government that was short of one seat from the absolute majority in the state parliament, the Landtag. The government failed to get its budget approved by the Parliament in 2012, so the Parliament was dissolved. The subsequent election was won by the two governing parties {{who went on to}} form Cabinet <b>Kraft</b> <b>II.</b>|$|R

The {{objective of this}} research is to investigate whether the use of new coatings (micro or nano TiO 2) and different pulp types could bring savings in wood, energy, GHG emissions and other environmental impacts in comparison with conventional printing and writing paper. We studied three types of pulp, namely i) unbleached virgin <b>kraft</b> pulp, <b>ii)</b> recovered fiber, and iii) high yield virgin chemithermo-mechanical pulp (CTMP).

2500|$|Paper {{was made}} one sheet {{at a time}} by hand until {{development}} of the Fourdrinier paper machine (c. 1801) which made a continuous sheet. [...] Paper making was severely limited by the supply of cotton and linen rags {{from the time of}} the invention of the printing press until the development of wood pulp (c. 1850s)in response to a shortage of rags. [...] The sulfite process for making wood pulp started operation in Sweden in 1874. Paper made from sulfite pulp had superior strength properties than the previously used ground wood pulp (c. 1840). The kraft (Swedish for strong) pulping process was commercialized in the 1930s. [...] Pulping chemicals are recovered and internally recycled in the kraft process, also saving energy and reducing pollution. [...] Kraft paperboard is the material that the outer layers of corrugated boxes are made of. [...] Until <b>Kraft</b> <b>corrugated</b> boxes were available, packaging consisted of poor quality paper and paperboard boxes along with wood boxes and crates. Corrugated boxes require much less labor to manufacture than wooden boxes and offer good protection to their contents. [...] Shipping containers reduce the need for packaging.|$|R
50|$|Some tubas have {{a strong}} and useful {{resonance}} {{that is not in}} the well-known harmonic series. For example, most large B tubas {{have a strong}} resonance at low E (E1, 39 Hz), which is between the fundamental and the second harmonic (an octave higher than the fundamental). These alternative resonances are often known as false tones or privileged tones. Adding the six semitones provided by the three valves, these alternative resonances let the instrument play chromatically down to the fundamental of the open bugle (which is a 29 Hz B0). The addition of valves below that note can lower the instrument a further six semitones to a 20 Hz E0. Thus, even three-valved instruments with good alternative resonances can produce very low sounds in the hands of skilled players; instruments with four valves can play even lower. The lowest note in the widely known repertoire is a 16 Hz double-pedal C0 in the William <b>Kraft</b> piece Encounters <b>II,</b> which is often played using a timed flutter tongue rather than by buzzing the lips. The fundamental of this pitch borders on infrasound and its overtones define the pitch in the listener's ear.|$|R

The {{objective of this}} research is to investigate whether the use of new coatings (micro or nano TiO 2) and different pulp types could bring savings in wood, energy, GHG emissions and other environmental impacts in comparison with conventional printing and writing paper. We studied three types of pulp, namely i) unbleached virgin <b>kraft</b> pulp, <b>ii)</b> recovered fiber, and iii) high yield virgin chemithermo-mechanical pulp (CTMP). A life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted from cradle to grave. Applying attributional modeling, we found that wood savings amount to 60 % for the nanoparticle coated recovered fiber paper and 35 % for the micro TiO 2 coated CTMP paper. According to the ReCiPe single score impact assessment method, the new product configurations allow the reduction of the environmental impacts by 10 – 35 % compared to conventional kraft paper. Applying consequential modeling,we found larger energy and GHG emission savings compared to attributional modeling because the saved wood is used for producing energy, thereby replacing fossil fuels. The nanoparticle coated recovered fiber paper offered savings of non-renewable energy use (NREU) by 100 % (13 GJ/ton paper) and GHG emission reduction by 75 % (0. 6 ton CO 2 eq. /ton paper). Micro TiO 2 coated CTMP paper offered NREU savings by 25 % (3 GJ/ton paper) and savings of GHG emissions by 10 % (0. 1 ton CO 2 eq. /ton paper). The taking into account of all environmental impacts with the ReCiPe single score method leads to comparable results as that of attributional modeling. We conclude that the nanoparticle coated recovered fiber paper offered the highest savings and lowest environmental impacts. However, human toxicity and ecotoxicity impacts of the nanoparticles were not included in this analysis and need further research. If this leads {{to the conclusion that the}} toxicity impacts of the nanoparticles are serious, then the CTMP paper with micro TiO 2 coating is the preferred option...|$|R
