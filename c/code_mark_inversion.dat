50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} line codes {{designed to be}} polarity insensitive -- whether the data stream is inverted or not, the decoded data will always be correct.The line codes with this property include differential Manchester encoding, bipolar encoding, NRZI, biphase <b>mark</b> <b>code,</b> <b>coded</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion,</b> and MLT-3 encoding.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike with Manchester encoding, {{only the}} {{presence}} of a transition is important, not the polarity. Differential coding schemes will work exactly the same if the signal is inverted (e.g. wires swapped). Other line codes with this property include NRZI, bipolar encoding, <b>coded</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion,</b> and MLT-3 encoding.|$|R
50|$|In telecommunication, <b>coded</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion</b> (CMI) is a non-return-to-zero (NRZ) line code.

The level used for one bits alternates each time one is coded.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT⎯To fit {{the limited}} volume and power {{consumption}} of the passive radio frequency transmission system of the electronic time fuze, an improved <b>coded</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion</b> (CMI) is proposed in this letter. From the performance analysis, the energy transmission efficiency of this encoding method is at least 50 % {{higher than that of}} CMI and NRZ. Finally, the experiment results show that by adopting this improved CMI, the change of DC voltage through magnetic coupling is lower than 0. 2 V when the accuracy of data transmission is above 99. 5 %.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} various line coding schemes using VHDL on Xilinx Spartans- 6 XC 6 SLX 45 FPGA platform {{for the purpose of}} security, area optimization and can support efficient digital communication in varying channel environment. The choice of line code depends upon presence or absence of DC level, power spectral density, Bandwidth requirement, Bit error rate (BER) performance, ease of clock signal recovery and presence or absence of inherent error detection property. The line encoding schemes used are Unipolar RZ and NRZ, Polar RZ and NRZ, AMI and Manchester coding and Pseudo ternary encoding, <b>Coded</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Inversion</b> format. Select pin impinged on the chip enables the users to select any one of the line encoding technique according to their requirement.

50|$|MLT-3 {{encoding}} (Multi-Level Transmit) is a {{line code}} (a signaling method used in a telecommunication system for transmission purposes) that uses three voltage levels. An MLT-3 interface emits less electromagnetic interference and requires less bandwidth than most other binary or ternary interfaces that operate at the same bit rate (see PCM for discussion on bandwidth / quantization tradeoffs), such as Manchester <b>code</b> or Alternate <b>Mark</b> <b>Inversion.</b>|$|R

50|$|Modified AMI {{codes are}} a digital {{telecommunications}} technique to maintain system synchronization. Alternate <b>Mark</b> <b>Inversion</b> (AMI) line <b>codes</b> are modified by deliberate insertion of bipolar violations. There are {{several types of}} modified AMI codes, used in various T-carrier and E-carrier systems.|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} codes are bipolar codes, where the pulses can be positive, {{negative}} or absent. In the typical alternate <b>mark</b> <b>inversion</b> <b>code,</b> non-zero pulses alternate between being positive and negative. These rules may be violated to generate special symbols used for framing or other special purposes.|$|R
50|$|Vendor cables {{are often}} wired with tip and ring reversed—i.e. pins 1 and 2 reversed, or pins 4 and 5 reversed. This {{has no effect}} on the signal quality of the T1 signal, which is fully differential, and uses the Alternate <b>Mark</b> <b>Inversion</b> (AMI) {{signaling}} scheme.|$|R
40|$|<b>Marked</b> surface <b>inversions</b> occur most {{frequently}} in dry continental climates, where low atmospheric humidity allows heat transfer by long wave thermal radiation. In the northern latitudes, surface inversions reach their maximum intensity during the winter, when the incoming Sun's radiation is negligible and radiative cooling is dominant {{during the long}} nights. During winter, air mass boundaries are sharp, which causes formation of <b>marked</b> surface <b>inversions.</b> The existence of these inversions and sharp boundaries {{increase the risk of}} wind shear. The information should refer to <b>marked</b> <b>inversions</b> exceeding a temperature difference of 10 deg C up to 1000 feet. The need to determine the temperature range over which he information is operationally needed and the magnitude of the inversion required before a notification to pilots prior to departure is warranted are outlined...|$|R

50|$|The term digital {{baseband}} modulation (or digital baseband transmission) {{is synonymous}} to line codes. These are methods to transfer a digital bit stream over an analog baseband channel (a.k.a. lowpass channel) using a pulse train, i.e. a discrete number of signal levels, by directly modulating the voltage or current on a cable or serial bus. Common examples are unipolar, non-return-to-zero (NRZ), Manchester and alternate <b>mark</b> <b>inversion</b> (AMI) codings.|$|R
50|$|If the {{characteristics}} of the input data do not follow the pattern that every eighth bit is '1', the coder using alternate <b>mark</b> <b>inversion</b> adds a '1' after seven consecutive zeros to maintain synchronisation. On the decoder side, this extra '1' added by the coder is removed, recreating the correct data. Using this method the data sent between the coder and the decoder is longer than the original data by less than 1% on average.|$|R

50|$|T-carrier and E-carrier {{signals are}} {{transmitted}} using a scheme called bipolar encoding, a.k.a. Alternate <b>Mark</b> <b>Inversion</b> (AMI), where a ONE {{is represented by}} a pulse, and a ZERO is represented by no pulse. Pulses (which represent ones) always alternate in polarity, so that if, for example two positive pulses are received in succession, the receiver knows that an error occurred (a violation) in that one or more bits were either added or deleted from the original signal.|$|R
5000|$|One kind of bipolar {{encoding}} is a paired disparity code, {{of which}} the simplest example is alternate <b>mark</b> <b>inversion.</b> In this <b>code,</b> a binary 0 is encoded as zero volts, as in unipolar encoding, whereas a binary 1 is encoded alternately as a positive voltage or a negative voltage. The name arose because, {{in the context of}} a T-carrier, a binary '1' is referred to as a [...] "mark", while a binary '0' is called a [...] "space".|$|R
