5|$|A writer {{tends to}} find her {{characters}} in her self, so I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you...</b> that Nixon, Pat, Mme. Mao, Kissinger and the chorus were all 'me.' And the inner lives of Mao and Chou En-Lai, who I couldn't find in myself at all, were drawn {{from a couple of}} close acquaintances.|$|E
5|$|Men, I know you’ve {{all been}} waiting to learn what this cruise is about, and why we’re still headed southeast. Now, at last, I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{that we are going}} on the voyage which all submariners have dreamed of ever since they possessed the means of doing so. We have the ship and we have the crew. We’re going around the world, nonstop. And we’re going to do it entirely submerged.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for residents to access other remote areas by foot. Most locals <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how many days it would take to walk to most locations within the country. Walking often is the only way for people to get to their local villages anyway, as many local airstrips are in disrepair. The maintenance of airstrips is a Local Level Government responsibility, and many LLGs in the surrounding area are severely underfunded.|$|E
60|$|Norna. I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> little. From my hiding-place I {{heard her}} vow never to confess whose dagger {{had been found}} in her apartment, and her jealous lord, in his wild anger, murdered her.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} things about the fantastical creatures carved of wood is that every piece is removable, it's how you <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> have a piece carved by one of the original great carvers. The later carvers didn't learn the technique of making each piece fit so well that it could be removed and put back in again and again. Those pieces have more than tripled in value. The painting on these figures is also more intense and varied.|$|E
25|$|I {{must tell}} you that in Mauritania, freedom is total: freedom of thought, {{equality}} – of all men and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, this is in the past. There are probably former relationships – slavery relationships and familial relationships from old days and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But (slavery) is something that is totally finished. All people are free in Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. And I believe that I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that no one profits from this commerce.|$|E
25|$|This is {{something}} that a Muslim gynecologist <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{if you need to}} or not… There used to be a lady who used to do this for women, or, I mean, young girls. She is expected to cut only the tip of the sexual sensitive part in the girl, so that she is not hypersexually active. This is the purpose... you see in societies where circumcision of girls is completely prohibited, hypersexuality takes over the entire society, and a woman is not satisfied with one person, or two, or three. This, God forbid, is now happening even in Muslim societies where they prohibit circumcision. They use a mistake in practice to prohibit the tradition, and they end up causing a lot of damage on the extreme side of the sexual life of the woman.|$|E

He later said that [...] "We have no word for downhill in Senegalese because we have no mountains. I was so afraid I almost threw up.

500|$|On May 14, {{the day of}} the {{scheduled}} vote on Thorne-Begland's appointment, Republican Governor Bob McDonnell stated that the candidate's sexuality should not be an issue: [...] "All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> is what I've always said about judges, and that is that these ought to be merit-based selections solely based on a person's skill, ability, fairness, judicial temperament". Thorne-Begland also attempted to address concerns by pledging to [...] "neutrally apply the laws" [...] and avoid political advocacy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have left}} you forever, Blanche. God bless and reward you! God {{make you a}} happy woman in all your life to come! Cruel as you will think me, love, I have never been so truly your sister as I am now. I <b>can</b> only <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> this--I <b>can</b> never <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> more. Forgive me, and forget me, our lives are parted lives from this day." ...|$|R

500|$|While Larson {{was running}} up the score, the show's {{producers}} contacted Michael Brockman, then head of CBS's daytime programming department. In a 1994 TV Guide interview commemorating the Larson Sweep, conducted {{at the time the}} movie Quiz Show was released, he recalled [...] "Something was very wrong. Here was this guy from nowhere, and he was hitting the bonus box every time. It was bedlam, I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> and we couldn't stop this guy.

500|$|The Grand Prince Ferdinando was grievously {{ill with}} syphilis; {{he had become}} prematurely senile, not {{recognising}} anybody who came to see him. Cosimo despaired. He successfully requisitioned the assistance of Pope Clement XI with Anna Maria Franziska. He sent the Archbishop of Prague to reproach her. She cited the example of Marguerite-Louise, adding that the Pope did not bother himself to machinate a reconciliation. Cosimo wrote desperate missives to the Electress Palatine: [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> now, in case you are not informed, {{that we have no}} money in Florence..." [...] He added that [...] "two or three quarters of my pension are fallen into arrears." ...|$|E

500|$|Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "a breathless new biography" [...] by Herbert. In a review in the Herald Sun, Blanche Clark was critical and said, [...] "Herbert's loose timeline is irritating, as is some of her glib commentary, such as: 'When her parents took her out to restaurants, she would use the breadsticks as drum batons—music was clearly in the blood.'" [...] St. Petersburg Times book critic Colette Bancroft said of the images in the book, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> lots of the photos are fun, although a few are a little scary, {{like the one in}} which she looks like a space alien awaiting a gynecological exam." ...|$|E
500|$|Disappointed by {{the lack}} of {{progress}} on the film's production, aspiring screenwriter/comic book fan Alex Ford was able to have a script of his (titled Superman: The Man of Steel) accepted at the studio's offices in September 1998. Ford pitched his idea for a film series consisting of seven installments, and his approach impressed Warner Bros. and Peters, though he was later given a farewell due to creative differences. Ford said, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> they don't know much about comics. Their audience isn't you and me who pay $7.00. It's for the parents who spend $60 on toys and lunchboxes. It is a business, and what's more important, the $150 million at the box office or the $600 million in merchandising?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{most recent}} {{meeting between the}} two clubs was in the FA Cup semi-finals; the tie was decided by a replay as the initial game {{finished}} goalless. The match was settled in extra time when Giggs {{ran the length of}} the pitch and evaded several Arsenal players to score the winning goal. In the close season, Anelka was involved in a protracted transfer saga and vowed to never play for Arsenal again. He cited the media in England as a reason for wanting to leave the club: [...] "The one thing I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> is that I can't stand the English Press, who cause me enormous problems on a personal level," [...] but it was implied that his [...] "gold-digging brothers" [...] wanted Anelka to move abroad to make more money – they served as his agents.|$|E

"Yes, I can," [...] said Otto, [...] "for when I grow to {{be a man}} I {{will come}} again and marry thee, and when thou art my wife I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> all the stories that I know.

6000|$|... "Now {{a plague}} on thee, for a stupid hot-blood," [...] cried the jarl; [...] "if thou art so displeased with the word, I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> that it need never be used, for, if ye will take service with the King, {{he will give}} thee the charge and the {{revenues}} of a goodly district, where thou shalt be master and a jarl too." ...|$|R
500|$|.....of [...] that I have read, the {{negative}} ones often {{say something to}} the effect that the book is just like the game, so why read it? What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> is that the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E
500|$|Franken said {{he learned}} that 21% of Americans {{received}} most of their news from talk radio, an almost exclusively conservative medium. Said Franken, [...] "I didn't want {{to sit on the}} sidelines, and I believed Air America could make a difference." [...] In November 2003, Franken talked about moving back to his home state of Minnesota to run for the Senate. At the time the seat, once held by Wellstone, was occupied by Republican Norm Coleman. At a 2004 Democratic presidential campaign event, Franken tackled a man who was allegedly threatening other attendees and heckling Governor Howard Dean. [...] In 2005, Franken announced his move to Minnesota: [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> honestly, I don't know if I'm going to run, but I'm doing the stuff I need {{to do in order to}} do it." [...] In late 2005, Franken started his own political action committee, called Midwest Values PAC. By early 2007, the PAC raised more than $1 million.|$|E
500|$|Cheryl Caira, Rosemary Goring and Anne Johnstone {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} The Herald, and describe Halperin's experiences in the book as [...] "certainly entertaining, and at times scandalous". Ben Widdicombe of New York Daily News notes Halperin [...] "received the most offensive response imaginable" [...] when he asked a Scientology official who Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard would have voted for in the 2008 United States presidential election; according to Halperin, he asserted he spoke with a recruiter for Scientology, [...] "He said, 'I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> who shouldn't be President - Barack Obama, Condoleezza Rice and the Rev. Al Sharpton. They {{should not be allowed}} to run for office, they should be sweeping the office.'" [...] A review of the book in The Independent comments that the YouTube links provided throughout the book [...] "have the effect of making virtually everyone who tries to help him seem nice while presenting Halperin as an unscrupulous creep".|$|E
