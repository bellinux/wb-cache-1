Summary In 1998 - 2006, the main contributors of variation are GDP itself and rice shocks but are only GDP shocks in 2007 - 2016. Main drivers of inflation during 1998 - 2006 are its own innovations and shocks from external factors. Nevertheless, in the following period, they are its own shocks and shocks from oil price and domestic <b>credit</b> <b>aggregate.</b> Credit channel is found to have an important role in monetary transmission mechanism, while interest rate might not be the main instrument of the central bank to control inflation.

This paper presents new evidence consistent with standard economic theory and a more benign interpretation of cross-border private capital flows.

However, during periods of volatile growth, more flows {{have been associated with}} slower growth.

Specific orderings among a narrow monetary aggregate, a broad monetary aggregate and a <b>credit</b> <b>aggregate</b> differ depending upon the stability criterion being applied and the country under study. On balance, credit exhibits the most stable contemporaneous relationship among the three aggregates, while the narrow money stock exhibits the most stable dynamic relationship with credit in second place and the broad money stock third. Further tests for the same five economies also show that, within the total of nonfinancial debt comprising the aggregate, the respective publicand private debt components exhibit movements over time that offset one another, and hence act to maintain the stability of total credit in relation to economic activity. Finally, additional tests for these five economies do not support the notion that the comparability of the respective relationships of credit and money to nonfinancial economic activity is due to any straightforward process whereby "money causes income and income causes credit. " The interrelationships among money, credit, real income and prices in each economy are too complex to admit of any such simple interpretation. ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} thirty years there have been {{dramatic}} changes in the monetary policy transmission mechanisms in China. The People’s Bank of China (PBC) began functioning as the central bank in 1984 and since then monetary policy has been used to promote economic growth and control inflation rate. The PBC introduced the “credit growth quota system” in 1986, which was replaced by the window guidance system in January 1998. Meanwhile, financial markets (money market, bond market and stock market) have made significant progresses. During this transition, the intermediate and operating targets also switched to monetary aggregate (M 2) and monetary supply respectively, with the adoption of a combination of monetary policy instruments. In this circumstance, China’s monetary policy transmission mechanisms {{have been one of the}} most studied topics. First, we test whether an effective interest rate channel exists currently in China using a standard VAR method, because it is the core channel of policy transmission in neoclassical economics and short-term interest rates have been used as the operating target by central banks in all developed economies and most of emerging markets. We test the effects of weighted average 7 -day interbank money market interest rate and 7 -day repurchase rate on real output, general price level from 1996 :Q 1 to 2008 :Q 1 and find that changes in short-term interest rates could not impact on real output and general price level significantly as expected. However, an effective interest rate channel has not come into existence, though significant advancements in market-based interest rate reform have been made during the past two decades. Secondly, we identify bank lending channel in China based on quarterly data covering 1997 :Q 1 to 2008 :Q 4. We construct a VECM model using commercial bank one-year lending rate, bank <b>credit</b> <b>aggregate,</b> required reserve ratio, inflation rate and real output. The Johansen cointegration tests identified two cointegration relationships among them. To disentangle the forces between credit demand and credit supply, which drives the changes in <b>credit</b> <b>aggregate,</b> we impose joint restrictions on the two-cointegration relationships simultaneously, and find that the PBC could affect the bank credit supply using required reserve ratio in the long-run equation. The corresponding loading matrix shows us that short-run disequilibria in the long-run relationship could be corrected through bank lending rate. Thirdly, we evaluate the possibility of taking McCallum rule as a monetary policy guideline for the PBC using quarterly data from 1994 :Q 1 to 2009 :Q 1. A medium-term or long-term policy rule could provide a stable framework, which reduce uncertainty and increase the credibility and transparency of current and future government policies, monetary policy effectiveness would be improved if the policymaker were to follow a rule. We use a counterfactual simulation method to evaluate the original McCallum rule and an improved McCallum rule. The results show that following the McCallum rule could reduce the root mean square error between nominal GDP target and simulated nominal GDP significantly. Then, we use the historical analysis method to confirm this result. When the actual value of monetary base deviates from the rule-produced values dramatically, China’s economy encounters inflation or deflation problems. Therefore, this study argues for the McCallum rule as a policy guideline for China...|$|E
40|$|Assessing {{the risk}} of banking crises 1 Over the last two decades, banking crises have become more {{frequent}} and severe in both emerging market and industrial countries. 2 Their cost in terms of output lost has been high, typically double digit percentages of GDP. For this reason, considerable efforts have been made recently to develop “early warning indicators ” of crises that could allow policymakers to take remedial action in a more timely fashion. This special feature proposes a set of forward-looking indicators of banking distress. As in Borio and Lowe (2002) we argue {{that it may be}} possible recognise the build-up of one set of vulnerabilities that foreshadows banking distress with a reasonable degree of confidence, although the exact timing of the crises remains unpredictable. The corresponding indicators draw exclusively on ex ante information, are based on the interaction among a small set of variables, focus on the cumulative processes giving rise to distress and allow for variable horizons. Here we extend our previous work, which had mainly considered <b>credit</b> <b>aggregate</b> and asset prices, by examining the information contained in real exchange rate appreciations and the relative performance of indicators in industrial and emerging market countries. In the first section of this article we briefly discuss the origins of banking crises. In the second we motivate the choice of indicators and assess their performance. In the concluding section we note some caveats to the analysis and suggest areas for future work.

The effectiveness was measured by two indicators. They are: (1). how fast or how many time lag needed since the shock of monetary instruments (rSBI) until the realisation of intermediary target of monetary policy (monetary aggregate). (2). How strong the variables of Interest Rate Channel response the shock of SBI interest rate and other variable. This study used secondary data issued by Bank Indonesia. The result of the study shows that response velocity of variable in Interest Rate Channel towards shock instrument of monetary policy (SBI) until reach the final target about 4 months. While impulse response function of variables in this channel to the shock instrument of monetary policy (SBI) is quiet weak and the main variable in interest rate money market among bank (PUAB) able to explain diversity intermediary target of monetary policy (Monetary Aggregate) about 2, 82 %. This result once shows a weak Granger causality and predictive power between PUAB as the operational target with monetary aggregate as the intermediary target of monetary policy.

40|$|Key to the {{efficient}} conduct of monetary {{policy is the}} condition that it must exert a systematic influence on the economy in a forward-looking sense. A priori economic theory backed by some empirical evidence has identified the main channels through which monetary policy impacts its final targets, viz, output, employment and inflation. Broadly, the vehicles of monetary transmission can be classified into financial market prices (eg, interest rates, exchange rates, yields, asset prices, equity prices) or financial market quantities (money supply, <b>credit</b> <b>aggregates,</b> supply of government bonds and foreign denominated assets). It is recognized that, whereas these channels are not mutually exclusive, {{the relative importance of}} each channel may differ from one economy to another depending on a number of factors, including the underlying structural characteristics, the state of development of financial markets, the instruments available to monetary policy, the fiscal stance and the degree of openness.

40|$|Theoretical {{models of}} the role of credit in {{business}} cycles and of the transmission mechanism have largely concluded that, given capital market imperfections, credit conditions may amplify and propagate the effect of shocks in the economy. This paper compares the behavior of loans to households and loans to nonfinancial corporations in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Analyzing <b>credit</b> <b>aggregates</b> in these countries in a framework accounting for diverging economic environments allows for an assessment of how the amplifying and asymmetric effects of <b>credit</b> <b>aggregates</b> differ between market-based and bank-based financial systems.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of stylised facts {{relating}} to cyclical developments in money and <b>credit</b> <b>aggregates</b> and in interest rates {{since the start of the}} new millennium in all the major advanced regions of the world, including the euro area, that are puzzling. There would seem to be a new aspect to the way money has behaved in recent times, namely the acceleration in the growth rate of the money stock that occurred when one would have expected the opposite, i. e., a slowing down in response to the weaker growth as in the US (in the early years of the new millennium) and the slowing growth rate in the euro area (approximately over the same time period). This paper discusses these puzzles in monetary dynamics and proposes some possible explanations, primarily the democratisation of financial markets and sounder money. Furthermore, we discuss the role of uncertainty in money demand and chart its influence on monetary developments in the euro area. We conclude that there is a risk that the traditional effects of rapid growth in money and <b>credit</b> <b>aggregates</b> and low interest rates are merely being postponed and will show up later in an acceleration in the pace of aggregate demand which will not be matched by a corresponding increase in the capacity of the economy to supply goods and services and may therefore translate into accelerating inflation. 1...|$|R
