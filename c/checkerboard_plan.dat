40|$|The {{specified}} area {{is located}} in the city district Brno - Židenice, near the railway station. The theme of the thesis is the architectural study of selected part of the multifunctional intense urban structure, which was solved in the pre-diploma project. Draft uses the building site intensively, provides high plot ratio and density of population, a wide range of functions in a relatively small area is related to the elimination of transportation. By using topography the proposal creates a permeable areas, buildings with relations to the surroundings and with quality public spaces and attractive housing. Pick-up railway cancels barrier and makes a space with landscaping. Readability is achieved by linking the territory from east to west by straight streets and from north to south by passages. The development creates three centers, the commercial center of the north, center of culture {{in the heart of the}} area and the center of relaxation and sport in the south. Basic grid of development has a <b>checkerboard</b> <b>plan,</b> which reflects the grid of surrounding structure. The new development varies in its scale, from large scale buildings in the parterre decays into smaller scale. Function division is horrizontal. There are underground parking, a parterre with shops and services, a floor with offices and work study open to the courtyard and housing on the upper floors. Thus formed structure provides enough light in the courtyards and flats. The segmentation is supported by materials, bricks in the parterre contrast with the monotone plaster on the upper floors...|$|E
