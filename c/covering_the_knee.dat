5000|$|His grandson, Edward Livingston (1764-1836) {{described}} Robert of Clermont at eighty-four as: [...] "... a gentleman... {{tall and}} somewhat bent, but not emaciated by age which had marked, but not disfigured, a face once remarkable for its regular beauty of features, and still beaming with the benevolence and intelligence {{that had always}} illuminated it. He marked the epoch at which {{he retired from the}} world by preserving its costume: the flowing wool powered wig, the bright brown coat, with large cuffs and square shirts, the cut velvet waistcoast, with ample flaps and the breeches scarcely <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> the silk stocking, rolled over them with embroidered clocks, and shining square-toed shoes, fastened near the ankle and small embossed gold buckles. These were retained in his service, not to affect a singularity, but because he thought it ridiculous at his time of life to follow the quick succession of fashion." [...] He always rose at five and read until breakfast. The year before his death, he took up the study of German and spoke it fluently.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Air shower {{simulations}} with CORSIKA {{have shown}} that the muon charge ratio measured in EAS is an observable which can provide information about the primary mass of the cosmic particle producing the EAS and on the hadronic interactions governing the propagation. The EAS detection system is built in IFIN-HH Bucharest, consisting of a mini-array working in coincidence with rotatable WILLI, which measures the muon charge ratio. The detection principle is to measure in coincidence shower parameters with the mini-array and the muon charge ratio with the WILLI detector. The mini-array is formed by 12 detection systems, each consisting of 4 scintillation plates (0. 475 × 0. 475 m 2 area), read out by two PMTs. Based on simulations and taking into account the topological environment around WILLI, the optimum configuration of the array has been implemented. From first data, the reconstructed shower cores and incident direction of individual showers have been obtained. New simulations have been performed by adding other 12 stations for the mini-array to increase the sensitive area of shower detection. The quality of the reconstruction of shower parameters will significantly increase and the accessible energy range can be extended to around 1016 eV, i. e. <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> of the cosmic ray spectrum...|$|E

40|$|This thesis focusses on {{the ongoing}} quest of imaging in {{juvenile}} idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The innovations {{within the field of}} imaging in JIA are discussed, in order to increase the added value of imaging in the evaluation of disease activity and the management of patients with JIA. The thesis is divided in three parts, with topics <b>covering</b> both <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> and wrist (Part I), knee only (Part II) and wrist only (III). In general, the following items are discussed: international collaboration on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in JIA, preferred locations for JIA on MRI of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> and wrist, comparison of MRI of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> between unaffected children and clinically active JIA patients, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI in <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> and wrist and bone health of JIA patients as determined on X-ray of the hand...|$|R
5000|$|Chapter I, [...] "The Internal Empire", starts by <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> Wounded <b>Knee</b> Massacre, {{narrated by}} {{survivor}} Black Elk. It {{goes on to}} cover the Robber Barons (specifically J. P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, Jay Gould, and George Pullman); strikes during 1892 such as the Copper Miners Strike, the New Orleans General Strike, the Railroad Switchmen's Strike, and the Steelworkers' Strike; the 1894 Railroad Strike against the Pullman Palace Car Company and Eugene V. Debs involvement in it; the Monroe Doctrine and the Open Door Policy; the invasion of Hawaii in 1893; and the 103 interventions carried out in other countries by the U.S. between 1798 and 1895, including Japan (1853-54), Nicaragua (1853-54), Uruguay (1855), Argentina (1853-54), and Angola (1860).|$|R
50|$|Boardshorts are {{normally}} longer than many shorts or form-fitting speedo styles of swimwear, and often (other than the waist) {{they have a}} loose or baggy appearance. The major reason for the extra length {{is to protect the}} wearer's legs from wax on the board. Surfboards are covered with a layer of sticky wax, which allows the surfer to stand on the board without slipping off. However, this wax can rip leg hair off a surfer when sitting on the board waiting for waves. Long boardshorts cover the back of the leg when sitting on the board, preventing the wax from ripping out the leg hair. The length of boardshorts is also affected by fashion trends; the length can range from mid-thigh (old school) to below <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>knee.</b> In <b>the</b> 2000s, boardshorts were often worn low in the back, exposing the top of the buttocks. Many designs of board shorts use vibrant color, striking patterns including Hawaiian floral images, and highlighted stitching; however not all boardshorts have these features.|$|R
5000|$|On the {{foundation}} of a kosode (小袖), which is a white, slender garment <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> wearer to <b>knee</b> level, <b>the</b> Ookuchi-hakama, a pair of red, long hakama, is worn over the kosode and tied off on the wearer's left. Then, the hitoe is worn as an upper garment; a number of layers of akome is worn above the hitoe according to seasonal requirements. The ue-no-bakama, a shorter, white hakama, with an open fly, is worn above the akome, tied off to the right. The shitagasane, a garment typically white, with the characteristic [...] "tail" [...] of the sokutai, the covers the upper body of the wearer. Then, the hampi, a sleeveless vest, often featuring intricate embroidery, is worn over all these layers. The final outer robe is then worn over the hampi.|$|R
5000|$|Goal pads - Perhaps {{the most}} visible part of a goalie's equipment, goalie [...] "legs" [...] are thickly padded, flat-faced leg pads <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> top of the skate, the player's shin and <b>the</b> <b>knees,</b> and {{incorporate}} additional padding {{on the inside of}} <b>the</b> leg and <b>knee</b> to protect <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint when dropping into a [...] "butterfly". Pads are 11 or 12 in wide (recent NHL rule changes reduced the width of the pads) and sized to fit the individual player's legs. Most shots are blocked by some method of [...] "pad stop".|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{differences in}} sun-protection behaviours, and incidence of sunburn, between Australian adolescent female fake tan users and non-users. Design: Cross sectional survey. Method: 398 adolescent females aged 12 to 18 years {{participated in a}} survey at public venues, schools, and online. The main outcome measures were self-reported fake tan usage in the past 12 months, frequency of sunburns and habitual sun-protection behaviours. Setting: Surveys were completed in New South Wales, Australia. Results: The prevalence of self-reported use of fake tanning products in the past 12 months among Australian adolescent females was 34. 5 %. Female fake tan users were {{significantly less likely to}} report wearing a hat, wearing a shirt with sleeves or wearing pants <b>covering</b> to <b>the</b> <b>knees.</b> There was no difference between fake tan users and non-users in use of sunscreen, seeking shade, wearing sunglasses or avoidance of peak ultraviolet (UV) hours. Logistic regression modelling, when accounting for age, desire for a tan and skin type, revealed fake tan users were more likely to experience frequent sunburns and less likely to wear protective clothing. Conclusions: Our findings show that fake tan use among Australian female adolescents is associated with decreased sun protection, specifically reduced use of both upper and lower body protective clothing. Fake tan users {{were significantly more likely to}} experience repeated sunburns, after controlling for skin type. These findings provide impetus for the development of health education programmes targeting a new subgroup of adolescents with distinct tanning behaviours...|$|R
40|$|We {{observed}} {{a case of}} early-onset osteolysis in a cemented total knee arthroplasty. Preoperative radiographs suggested numerous radiopaque particles <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> polyethylene insert.

50|$|Stockings (also {{known as}} hose, {{especially}} in a historical context) are close-fitting, variously elastic garments <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> leg from the foot up to <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> or possibly part {{or all of the}} thigh. Stockings vary in color, design, and transparency. Today, stockings are primarily worn for fashion and aesthetics, usually in association with mid-length skirts.|$|R
50|$|The carving on {{the south}} wall {{to the east of}} the portico depicts Shiva and Parvati seated on their abode Mount Kailash. The four-armed Shiva is seen with a crown and a disc behind it (all damaged), the sacred thread across his chest, and a {{dressing}} gown <b>covering</b> up to <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> Parvati, dressed in her finery with her hair falling to the front, looks away. Behind her at the right is a woman attendant holding the child, identified with her son Kartikeya, the war-god. Many male and female attendants are seen behind the main figures. Shiva's attendant, the skeleton-like Bhringi, is seated at his feet. Other figures, not distinct, depict, among others, a royal-looking tall person, ascetics, a fat figure, a dwarf, a bull (the mount of Shiva), features of a Garuda, and two monkeys. The scenic beauty of the mountain is sculpted with the sky background amidst heavenly beings showering flowers on Shiva-Parvati. This scene is interpreted as a gambling scene, where Parvati is angry as Shiva cheats in a game of dice.|$|R
50|$|Elephant bells, {{popular in}} the mid-to-late 1970s, were similar to loon pants, but were {{typically}} made of denim. Elephant bells had a marked flare below <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> often <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> wearer's shoes. The preferred shoes were platform shoes with soles at least 2 in thick and heels 4 to 5 in to keep the pants' hems off the ground.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the other}} Tripuri, the {{traditional}} dress of the Reang {{is simple and}} plain. Men traditionally wear a hand woven loin cloth {{and a piece of}} cloth as a wrapper for the upper body. The women wear a long cloth called Mnai, a wraparound; from the waist to down to <b>the</b> <b>knees,</b> a Rsa <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> chest, and Rikatouh for <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> whole upper half of the body. The fabric is usually woven by the Reang women and very colourful. However moderisation has caught up with the Bru and most urban Reang no longer wear their traditional costumes.|$|R
50|$|The V-H move (also {{called the}} Split Butterfly or loading the post) is a move with which profly style goaltenders identify. This is a {{relatively}} recent tactical response to a shooter that is advancing from behind the net towards {{the front of the}} net, and has the option to pass. The goaltender places <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> farthest from <b>the</b> shooter down horizontally along the goal line. <b>The</b> <b>knee</b> closest to <b>the</b> puck remains vertical next to the goal post. The advantage is on coverage against quick shots to the near side of the net, while still <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> option to track passes {{to the front of the}} goal mouth.|$|R
50|$|However, it does {{sometimes}} feature metal parts. These mainly include light chainmail {{and wide}} metal plates fastened to leather belts <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> chest, shoulders, and back. The strongest and most agile warriors can also add a skirt of modestly sized metal plates joined by ring mail, which covers their legs to <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> or even lower, {{as well as}} a forged helmet with a terrifying iron mask.|$|R
5000|$|Modest {{clothing}} (1 Tim. 2:9), {{which is}} defined as loose <b>covering</b> from <b>the</b> neck to below <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> in all normal body postures (Exod. 20:26; 28:42-43). This would also include the strict prohibition of mixed bathing or public swimming.|$|R
5000|$|Breeches ( [...] ) are {{an article}} of {{clothing}} <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> body from the waist down, with separate coverings for each leg, usually stopping just below <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> though in some cases reaching to the ankles. The breeches were normally closed and fastened about the leg, along its open seams at varied lengths, and to <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> by either buttons or by a drawstring, or {{by one or more}} straps and buckle or brooches. Formerly a standard item of Western men's clothing, they had fallen out of use by the mid-19th century in favour of trousers. Modern athletic garments used for English riding and fencing, although called breeches or britches, differ from breeches in ways discussed below.|$|R
5000|$|The {{open end}} of the bore facing away from the player (the [...] "bell") may be covered to produce extra notes or effects. Because both hands are {{typically}} engaged in holding <b>the</b> recorder or <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> finger holes, <b>the</b> <b>covering</b> of <b>the</b> bell is normally achieved by bringing the {{end of the}} recorder in contact with <b>the</b> leg or <b>knee,</b> typically achieved through a combination of bending of the torso and/or raising of <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> Alternatively, in rare cases instruments may be equipped with a key designed to cover the bell ("bell key"), operated by one of the fingers, typically the pinky finger of the upper hand, which is not normally used to cover a hole. Fingerings with a covered bell extend the recorder's chromatic playable range above and below the nominal fingered range.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{the turn}} of the 18th century, the form of the kilt {{typically}} worn in the Scottish Highlands was what is now known as the belted plaid or great kilt, which consisted of a large tartan or multi-colored blanket or wrap (Gaelic felie, with various spellings) which was gathered into loose pleating and drawn about the body and secured by a belt at the waist, the lower part hanging down <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> legs to about <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b>|$|R
50|$|Here it diverges {{from the}} artery, and emerges {{from behind the}} lower edge of <b>the</b> aponeurotic <b>covering</b> of <b>the</b> canal; it descends {{vertically}} along the medial side of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> behind <b>the</b> sartorius, pierces the fascia lata, between the tendons of the Sartorius and Gracilis, and becomes subcutaneous.|$|R
5000|$|The Waverley Municipal Council {{decided that}} male surf bathers {{should be as}} well clothed in the surf as females. Their {{proposal}} was to require that a skirt reaching at least to <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> must be added and the arms concealed to near the elbows. The mayor of Waverley described the costume as: [...] "A combination, consisting of guernsey with trouser legs and reaching from near the elbow to the bend of <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> together with a skirt not unsightly but simply attached to <b>the</b> garment and <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> figure below the hips to the knee." [...] Loitering on the beach was also to be prohibited and all communication between bathers {{and the general public}} forbidden. The penalties for a breach of the regulation were proposed to be from £1 to £20.|$|R
25|$|Haredi {{women wear}} blouses <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> elbow and collarbone, and skirts that cover <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> while {{standing}} and sitting. The ideal sleeve and skirt length varies by community. Some women {{try not to}} follow fashion, while others wear fashionable, but modest, clothing. Haredi women avoid skirts with slits, preferring instead kick-pleats. They also avoid overly eye-catching colors, especially bright red, as well as clothing that is tight. Many will only wear closed-toe shoes, and always wear stockings, the thickness of which varies by community.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} costume of AgiasosThe {{distinctive feature}} of the traditional costume of Ayasos dating from the 18th century, are the pleated bloomers or breeches called a “salvari”. This loose fitting garment was worn in a number villages on the island, e.g. Plomari. These bloomers are usually six-leaved, with a width of three leaves. <b>The</b> material <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> inner part of the legs, from the crotch to below <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> named “kalamovrakia” or “klapatses” - are longer than the middle section i.e. {{the seat of the}} (bloomers).|$|R
50|$|A pāreu {{can be worn}} in many ways. Women {{will usually}} wrap it around their upper body, {{covering}} it from breasts to above <b>the</b> <b>knees.</b> Either they rely on their breasts for it not to slide down, or they may wrap a corner around their shoulder or their neck. In more traditional surroundings <b>the</b> <b>covering</b> of <b>the</b> upper body is less important, but <b>the</b> <b>covering</b> of <b>the</b> thighs is. Then it is worn as a longer skirt. Men wear it as a short skirt, or may even make shorts out of it, especially when fishing or working in the bush where freedom of movement of the legs is needed. But during quiet, cooler nights at home, they may wear it as a long skirt too.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike triathlons, {{which allow}} {{swimmers}} to wear wetsuits {{when the water}} is below a certain temperature (the standard is [...] at the surface or up to [...] for unofficial events.), most open water swim races either do not {{permit the use of}} wetsuits (usually defined as anything <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> body above the waist or below <b>the</b> <b>knees),</b> or put wetsuit-clad swimmers in a separate category and/or make them ineligible for race awards. This varies by locales and times of the year, where water temperatures are substantially below comfortable.|$|R
40|$|A 24 -year-old male {{presented}} {{after being}} involved in a motorcycle accident and {{was found to have}} soft tissue defects of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> with exposure of patella. Due to the severe injury from the popliteal fossa to the posterior aspects of the lower leg, repair with a free flap from anterolateral thigh perforator was planned instead of local calf muscle flap. Preoperative angiography was performed, and it showed that superior medial genicular perforator was patent compared with unreliable filling of the superior lateral genicular perforator. The soft tissue defect was repaired using the superior medial genicular perforator as the recipient vessel. This was performed by creating perforator to perforator anastomosis (supermicrosurgery). The flap survived successfully, and the patient was able to ambulate in a few weeks without serious complications. This case indicates that superior medial genicular perforator can be used as the recipient vessel for <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> soft tissue defects of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> caused by blunt injury...|$|R
40|$|Popliteal fossa is {{a diamond}} shaped intermuscular space {{posterior}} to <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint. It contains the popliteal vessels and terminal branches of sciatic nerve, {{embedded in the}} fat. Presence of any additional muscle slips in this region can entrap/compress the nerves and vessels, leading to neurovascular symptoms. We here report {{the presence of an}} additional muscle in the popliteal fossa. The muscle had a tendinous origin from <b>the</b> fascia <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> popliteal vessels. The fleshy belly of the muscle was lying superficial to the popliteal vessels and the tibial nerve. The tibial nerve passed from medial to lateral side undercover of the additional muscle. The muscle had a distal tendon that merged with the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle. It was innervated by a branch from the tibial nerve. The muscle was small and weak to cause any significant movement at <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint but was large enough to cause any neurovascular compression/entrapment symptoms...|$|R
40|$|A {{patient of}} {{essential}} hypertension stabilized on 10 mg amlodipine once daily developed brownish black petechial non-blanching macular rash bilaterally <b>covering</b> <b>the</b> limbs below <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> and dorsum of the feet. History, general and clinical examinations and lab investigations revealed no abnormalities. Temporal {{association of the}} onset of rash with amlodipine use, inability to explain rash by natural history of hypertension, possibility of rash with amlodipine and rash resolution on dechallenge placed this reaction in Naranjo score of 6, a probable adverse reaction to amlodipine. Hence the drug was replaced by enalapril. The rash resolved completely {{over a period of}} eight weeks...|$|R
50|$|Lack of {{stability}} in <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> is a {{main cause of}} rupturing the ACL in <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> Most advanced athletes struggle to gain enough stability within <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> while exercising causing the possibility of injury. The ACL exists to provide <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> stability {{but it is the}} athletes duty to make sure <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> is stable {{enough to be able to}} play out the game.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>knee</b> has a {{more complex}} {{movement}} pattern compared to the hip. At heel contact <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> extensor and flexor muscles co-contract to provide stability for <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint since it is almost maximally extended {{at that point in}} time. Shortly after, as the foot becomes flat on <b>the</b> ground, <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> gradually flexes approximately 10-15 degrees reaching the maximum at about 15% of the gait cycle. This small amount of knee flexion is controlled eccentrically by <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> extensor muscles which serve the purpose of cushioning the rate of loading on the lower-limb and preventing excessive knee flexion. Following through to mid-and terminal stance, <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> gradually extends with concentric activity of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> extensor muscles and approaches near full extension as heel off occurs (30-40% of gait cycle). At this point <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> flexor muscles concentrically flex <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> again for swing phase. <b>The</b> maximum <b>knee</b> flexion that occurs during swing is about 60 degrees.|$|R
50|$|Popliteal pulse: Above <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> in <b>the</b> popliteal fossa, {{found by}} holding <b>the</b> bent <b>knee.</b> <b>The</b> patient bends <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> at {{approximately}} 124°, and the physician holds it {{in both hands}} to find the popliteal artery in the pit behind <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> (Popliteal artery).|$|R
50|$|Another error where {{health of}} <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint is {{concerned}} is when <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> is not {{aligned with the}} direction of the toes. If <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> is not tracking over the toes during the movement this results in twisting/shearing of the joint and unwanted torque affecting the ligaments which can soon result in injury. <b>The</b> <b>knee</b> should always follow the toe. Have your toes slightly pointed out in order to track <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> properly.|$|R
