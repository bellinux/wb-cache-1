50|$|RCN (Residential Communications Network) was {{originally}} created in 1993 by developer David McCourt and Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc. Kiewit also owned MFS, a <b>Competitive</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Provider</b> (CAP). In {{a series of}} moves, RCN purchased C-TEC, the parent of Pennsylvania's Commonwealth Telephone, while MFS spun off its small residential telephone operations to RCN. MFS was later purchased by Worldcom. RCN/C-TEC became a competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) when the Telecom Act of 1996 passed.|$|E

50|$|Widespread {{introduction}} of automated mobile phone service in 1983 created two competing carriers in each city. Additional mobile carriers entered {{the market to}} provide digital service (such as GSM, introduced in 1991). In 1985, <b>competitive</b> <b>access</b> <b>providers</b> (CAPs) began to offer private line and special access services; originally based on PBX standards such as direct inward dial, these evolved into full competitive local exchange carriers (CLEC). The Telecommunications Act of 1996 required incumbent telephone companies to interconnect with the new entrants.|$|R
40|$|Local {{exchange}} companies (LECs) {{have argued}} that, because of entry, they {{will no longer}} be able to subsidize residential exchange service. The available economic data show that residential service is not subsidized. This finding casts doubt over the need for entrants to contribute to a universal service fund that would be used to subsidize residential service. Since 1984 there has been a radical decline in the cost of providing voice services. The failure of the LECs to adjust their rates to reflect the cost decline explains in part why <b>competitive</b> <b>access</b> <b>providers</b> have entered the market. ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} few years <b>competitive</b> <b>access</b> <b>providers</b> have {{deployed}} networks in selected major metropolitan areas across the USA and are offering local distribution services to long-distance companies in direct competition with telephone company services. To substantially expand the scope of the market in which they operate without dramatically increasing their network investment, they have requested state and federal regulatory agencies to allow the collocation of their transmission equipment inside telephone companies' local switching offices. Several major policy issues arise: If local telephone company access service prices continue to be tightly regulated, will the benefits of competition in the form of lower long-distance prices ultimately reach consumers? Would a national collocation policy simply redistribute industry revenues without directly benefiting the general public? And could collocation become a mechanism for long-distance companies to vertically integrate their operations into local exchange markets less than a decade after the massive effort to separate the toll and local markets that culminated in the AT&T divestiture?...|$|R
5000|$|CLECs {{evolved from}} the <b>competitive</b> <b>access</b> <b>providers</b> (CAPs) that began to offer private line and special access {{services}} in competition with the ILECs beginning in 1985. [...] The CAPs (such as Teleport Communications Group (TCG) and Metropolitan Fiber Systems (MFS) deployed fiber optic systems in the central business districts of the largest U.S. cities (New York, Chicago, Boston, etc.) A number of state public utilities commissions, particularly New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts, encouraged this competition. By the early 1990s, the CAPs began to install switches in their fiber systems. Initially, they offered a [...] "shared PBX" [...] service with these switches and interconnected with the ILECs as end users rather than as co-carriers. However, the New York Public Service Commission authorized the nation's first CLEC when it required the New York Telephone (the ILEC) to allow Teleport Communications Group's switches in New York City to connect as peers. Other states followed New York's lead {{so that by the}} mid-1990s most of the large states had authorized local exchange competition.|$|R
40|$|Fiber to the Home (FTTH) {{describes}} {{a set of}} emerging technologies {{with the potential to}} affect competition in local access. On one hand, the high cost of deploying fiber to the residence suggests limitations on facilities-based competition among FTTH networks. On the other hand, FTTH opens up new possibilities for service-level competition, defined as the sharing of a single network infrastructure by multiple higher-layer service providers, whether of the same or different services. Yet technology is hardly an exogenous factor that independently shapes future local access competition; the regulatory environment also plays a key role. By shaping expectations about future competitive requirements, current regulations influence network operators' deployment choices among competing FTTH technologies, as well as design choices made by vendors and standards bodies for technologies still under development. The current regulatory approach to FTTH is far from consistent. Network operators likely to deploy FTTH include Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILECs), incumbent cable operators, <b>competitive</b> <b>access</b> <b>providers</b> (including CLECs), independent telephone companies, and municipalities. This paper reviews the rules related to service-level competition that apply to each of these categories. In essence, the paper finds that if current regulatory trends continue, asymmetries in the regulation of service-level competition will be on steroids by the time FTTH starts being more commonly deployed. Current regulatory requirements are either non-existent, or extremely detailed and technology- and service- specific (e. g. UNEs). We argue that neither of these approaches is likely to achieve the desired result for FTTH, given the current state of flux in emerging FTTH technology. Comment: 29 th TPRC Conference, 200...|$|R
40|$|During {{the course}} of the network {{neutrality}} debate, advocates have proposed extending common carriage regulation to broadband Internet access services. Others have endorsed extending common carriage {{to a wide range of}} other Internet-based services, including search engines, cloud computing, Apple devices, online maps, and social networks. All too often, however, those who focus exclusively on the Internet era pay too little attention to the lessons of the legacy of regulated industries, which has long struggled to develop a coherent rationale for determining which industries should be subject to common carriage. Of the four rationales for determining the scope of common carriage—whether industry players (1) hold themselves out as serving all comers, (2) are “affected with a public interest,” (3) are natural monopolies, or (4) offer transparent transmission capability between points of the customers choosing without change—each has been discredited or is inapplicable to Internet-based technologies. Moreover, common carriage has long proven difficult to implement. Nondiscrimination is difficult to enforce when products vary in terms of quality or cost and forecloses demand-side price discrimination schemes (such as Ramsey pricing) that can increase economic welfare. In addition, the academic literature has long noted that the obligation to keep rates reasonable is difficult to apply, has trouble accommodating differences in quality, provides weak incentives to economize, creates systematic biases toward inefficient solutions, raises difficult questions about how to allocate common costs, deters innovation, and requires collusion by creating entry barriers, standardizing products, pooling information, providing advance notice of any pricing changes, and allowing the government to serve as the cartel enforcer. Three historical examples—early local telephone companies known as <b>competitive</b> <b>access</b> <b>providers,</b> the detariffing of business services, and Voice over Internet Protocol—provide concrete illustrations of how refraining from imposing common carriage regulation can benefit consumers...|$|R
