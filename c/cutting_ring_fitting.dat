40|$|An {{emergency}} {{spin recovery}} parachute is presented that is housed within a centrally mounted housing on the aft {{end of an}} aircraft and connected to a <b>ring</b> <b>fitting</b> within the housing. Two selectively latching shackles connected to separate towlines are openly disposed adjacent the <b>ring</b> <b>fitting.</b> The towlines extend in opposite directions from the housing along the aircraft wing to attachment points adjacent the wing-tips where {{the other end of}} each towline is secured. Upon pilot command, one of the open shackles latches to the <b>ring</b> <b>fitting</b> to attach the towline connected thereto, and a second command signal deploys the parachute. Suitable break-away straps secure the towlines to the aircraft surface until the parachute is deployed and the resulting force on the towline attached to the parachute overcomes the straps and permits the towline to extend to the point of attachment to exert sufficient drag on the spinning aircraft to permit the pilot to regain control of the aircraft. To employ the parachute as a drag chute to reduce landing speeds, both shackles and their respective towlines are latched to the <b>ring</b> <b>fitting...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{description}} is given of a modified lysimeter design and sampling procedure {{designed to prevent}} edge flow from occuring in large soil monolith lysimeters. An internal <b>cutting</b> <b>ring</b> {{at the base of}} the lysimeter casing produced a small annular gap between the soil monolith and the wall of the casing. This gap was filled with liquefied petrolatum, which provided a water-tight seal around the edge of the lysimeter. Water and solutes were unable to leak between the monolith and casing. The use of petrolatum as a sealant is suitable for water-flux and nutrient-leaching studies, but is not suitable for pesticide studies...|$|R

40|$|As {{introduced}} at ADASSI, a Fabry-Perot analysis package for IRAF is currently under {{development as a}} joint effort of ourselves and Frank Valdes of the IRAF group. Although additional portions of the package were also implemented, we report primarily {{on the development of}} a robust <b>ring</b> <b>fitting</b> task, useful for <b>fitting</b> the calibration <b>rings</b> obtained in Fabry-Perot observations. The general equation of an ellipse is fit to the shape of the rings, providing information on ring center, ellipticity, and position angle. Such parameters provide valuable information on the wavelength response of the etalon and the geometric stability of the system. Appropriate statistical weighting is applied to the pixels to account for increasing numbers with radius, the Lorentzian cross-section, and uneven illumination. The major problems of incomplete, non-uniform, and multiple rings are addressed with the final task capable of <b>fitting</b> <b>rings</b> regardless of center, cross-section, or completion. The task requires only minimal user intervention, allowing large numbers of rings to be fit in an extremely automated manner...|$|R

50|$|Hand-dug wells are {{excavations}} with diameters {{large enough}} to accommodate one or more people with shovels digging down to below the water table. The excavation is braced horizontally to avoid landslide or erosion endangering the people digging. They can be lined with laid stones or brick; extending this lining upwards above the ground surface to form a wall around the well serves to reduce both contamination and injuries by falling into the well. A more modern method called caissoning uses reinforced concrete or plain concrete pre-cast well rings that are lowered into the hole. A well-digging team digs under a <b>cutting</b> <b>ring</b> and the well column slowly sinks into the aquifer, whilst protecting the team from collapse of the well bore.|$|R

5000|$|The SRR was {{introduced}} by Pendry in 1999, {{and is one of}} the most common elements of metamaterials. As a nonmagnetic conducting unit, it comprises an array of units that yield an enhanced negative effective magnetic permeability, when the frequency of the incident electromagnetic field is close to the SRR resonance frequency. The resonant frequency of the SRR depends on its shape and physical design. In addition, resonance can occur at wavelengths much larger than its size. Evidently, further for the shape optimization of the specified elements it is expedient to use genetic and ant algorithms of optimization. With reference to multifrequency decisions it is meaningful to apply fractal’s frameworks Serpinsky on the basis of Kokh's broken line or others fractal's decisions instead of <b>cutting</b> <b>ring</b> or square SRR. Similar fractal's designs should be involved instead of rectilinear conductors.|$|R
40|$|The {{parallel}} computing power of commercial Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) is exploited to perform real-time <b>ring</b> <b>fitting</b> {{at the lowest}} trigger level using information coming from the Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector of the NA 62 experiment at CERN. To this purpose, direct GPU communication with a custom FPGA-based board {{has been used to}} reduce the data transmission latency. The GPU-based trigger system is currently integrated in the experimental setup of the RICH detector of the NA 62 experiment, in order to reconstruct ring-shaped hit patterns. The ring-fitting algorithm running on GPU is fed with raw RICH data only, with no information coming from other detectors, and is able to provide more complex trigger primitives with respect to the simple photodetector hit multiplicity, resulting in a higher selection efficiency. The performance of the system for multi-ring Cherenkov online reconstruction obtained during the NA 62 physics run is presented...|$|R

40|$|A new solar powered {{portable}} {{system for}} ice core drilling was developed especially {{for work on}} very high altitude glaciers requiring an extremely light {{and easy to use}} system. FELICS (Fast Electromechanical Lightweight Ice Coring System), with a net weight of 228 kg for the complete drilling system including power supply, represents a new design. The main features are the absence of an outer barrel and a tilting table, and the use of a one-piece <b>cutting</b> <b>ring,</b> which simplify utilisation of the device and make it very efficient. In addition, FELICS is designed to be installed inside a protective tent, effectively allowing a 24 hour working day. The new drilling system has been successfully employed in the European Alps and in the Andes (on Cerro Tapado, Chile at 5536 m a. s. l., on Illimani, Bolivia at 6300 m a. s. l. and on Chimborazo, Ecuador at 6250 m a. s. l.) with a drilling performance of 136 m in only 6 working days.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{fabricate}} micro surface textures on alumina ceramic, {{the effects of}} single pulse intervals processing and <b>ring</b> <b>cutting</b> processing on the laser surface textures were discussed. The advantages and disadvantages between the two kinds of processing method were compared. The crater diameter and depth increase {{with the increase of}} laser pulse energy, and the increasing number of pulses significantly affects the crater depth for the single pulse intervals processing. As for the <b>ring</b> <b>cutting</b> processing method, micro-pit depth changes with the average power, whereas the micro-pit diameter mainly changes with scan radium. By optimizing laser processing parameters the micro-pit dimensions could be independently controlled. These two methods could process micro-pits with different diameters and depth on alumina ceramic.

40|$|The {{study of}} 21 cm line {{observations}} of atomic hydrogen allows detailed {{insight into the}} kinematics of spiral galaxies. We use sensitive high-resolution Very Large Array data from The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) to search for radial gas flows primarily in the outer parts (up to 3 × r 25) of 10 nearby spiral galaxies. Inflows are expected to replenish the gas reservoir and fuel star formation {{under the assumption that}} galaxies evolve approximately in steady state. We carry out a detailed investigation of existing tilted <b>ring</b> <b>fitting</b> schemes and discover systematics that can hamper their ability to detect signatures of radial flows. We develop a new Fourier decomposition scheme that fits for rotational and radial velocities and simultaneously determines position angle and inclination as a function of radius. Using synthetic velocity fields we show that our novel fitting scheme is less prone to such systematic errors and that it is well suited to detect radial inflows in discs. We apply our fitting scheme to 10 THINGS galaxies and find clear indications of, at least partly previously unidentified, radial gas flows, in particular for NGC 2403 and NGC 3198 and to a lesser degree for NGC 7331, NGC 2903 and NGC 6946. The mass flow rates are of the same order but usually larger than the star formation rates. At least for these galaxies a scenario in which continuous mass accretion feeds star formation seems plausible. The other galaxies show a more complicated picture with either no clear inflow, outward motions or complex kinematic signatures...|$|R
25|$|Summer routes were {{introduced}} in 1932, <b>cutting</b> Sagene <b>Ring's</b> headway to fifteen minutes. Including slack a full round on the circle took 35 minutes. During a twelve-minute headway this went fine with three trams in each direction. The route {{could be done in}} 30 minutes, but without any slack. Oslo Sporveier ran the line with two trams per direction during the fifteen-minute headway services, but it was often difficult to keep the schedule with this scheme. During the summers 0 was combined with 13 so each service would run twice around the circle and then run on the Gamlebyen Line. From 1937 the reduced service and 0 and 13 combination was also run on Sundays. From 1940 line 13 was moved to the Sinsen Line.|$|R
