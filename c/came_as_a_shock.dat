5|$|The {{company had}} {{appeared}} {{to the public}} {{to be in good}} health during the 1920s, so its sudden collapse in 1929 <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock.</b> Bolckow Vaughan, effectively bankrupt, was forced by its bankers into a takeover by Dorman Long, which liquidated it. No company history was written.|$|E
5|$|By November 1944, Strong was {{reporting}} {{that there was}} a possibility of a German counteroffensive in the Ardennes or the Vosges. Smith sent Strong to personally warn Bradley, who was preparing an offensive of his own. The magnitude and ferocity of the German Ardennes Offensive <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock,</b> and Smith had to defend Strong against criticism for failing to sound the alarm. He felt Bradley had been given ample warning.|$|E

5|$|On his {{northern}} frontier Manuel expended considerable {{effort to}} preserve the conquests made by Basil II over one hundred years earlier and maintained, sometimes tenuously, ever since. Due to distraction from his neighbours on the Balkan frontier, Manuel was kept from his main objective, the subjugation of the Normans of Sicily. Relations had been good with the Serbs and Hungarians since 1129, so the Serb rebellion <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock.</b> The Serbs of Rascia, being so induced by Roger II of Sicily, invaded Byzantine territory in 1149.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Constantinople <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to the papacy, which {{ordered an}} {{immediate}} counter-attack {{in the form}} of a crusade. Only Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy responded but under the condition that a powerful monarch assist him; however, none would do so. Pope Pius II then ordered another crusade. Again, no substantial efforts were seen by any of Europe's major leaders of the time. This forced the Pope himself to lead a crusade. His death in 1464 led to the disbanding of the crusade at the port of Ancona.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a victory}} over the Buffalo Sabres after Christmas, and with the team still mired in 14th place in the Western Conference, General Manager and Executive Vice President Darryl Sutter {{announced}} his resignation from both positions on December 28, exactly eight years after {{he was hired by}} the team to become its coach in 2002. The move was not entirely Sutter's decision, as he was asked by the organization to step aside. The decision <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to many fans, even as it was believed to be inevitable following the team's decline in recent seasons. Jay Feaster assumed control of the team, serving as acting general manager.|$|E

5|$|It still <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to the Special Forces troopers at Lang Vei when 12 tanks {{attacked}} their camp. The Soviet-built PT-76 amphibious {{tanks of}} the 203rd NVA Armored Regiment churned over the defenses, {{backed up by}} an infantry assault by the 7th Battalion, 66th Regiment and the 4th Battalion of the 24th Regiment, both elements of the 304th Division. The ground troops had been specially equipped for the attack with satchel charges, tear gas, and flame throwers. Although the camp's main defenses were overrun in only 13 minutes, the fighting lasted several hours, during which the Special Forces men and Bru CIDGs managed to knock out at least five of the tanks.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick did {{not believe}} that there was any {{likelihood}} of another war with Germany in 1939, and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of the outbreak of the Second World War therefore <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock.</b> Determined not to spend another war in an internment camp, Chadwick made his way to Stockholm as fast as he could, but when he arrived there with his family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. They made their way back to England on a tramp steamer. When he reached Liverpool, Chadwick found Joseph Rotblat, a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. Chadwick promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English.|$|E
5|$|During the Prussian {{invasion}} of Hesse in June 1866, Victoria and Elisabeth {{were sent to}} England {{to live with their}} grandmother until hostilities were ended by the absorption of Hesse-Kassel and parts of Hesse-Darmstadt into Prussia. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, military hospitals were set up in the palace grounds at Darmstadt, and she helped in the soup kitchens with her mother. She remembered the intense cold of the winter, and being burned on the arm by hot soup. In 1872, Victoria's eighteen-month-old brother, Friedrich, was diagnosed with haemophilia. The diagnosis <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to the royal families of Europe; it had been twenty years since Queen Victoria had given birth to her haemophiliac son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, {{and it was the first}} indication that the bleeding disorder in the royal family was hereditary. The following year, Friedrich fell from a window onto stone steps and died. It was the first of many tragedies to beset the Hesse family.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos left Constantinople for Adrianople, {{situated}} {{close to}} the Byzantine–Bulgarian border, in order to monitor the events and to exploit the situation in Bulgaria in his favour. The demise of Constantine Tikh <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> for the Byzantines. Initially, Michael VIII considered marrying his daughter to Ivaylo, but eventually decided {{that it would be}} more favourable to install a protégé of his own. His candidate was Ivan, son of former Emperor Mitso Asen, who had sought asylum in Byzantium and possessed estates in Asia Minor. Ivan promptly married Michael VIII's daughter Irene, pledged allegiance to Michael VIII and was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria as Ivan Asen III. The Byzantines sent gifts to the Bulgarian nobles to incite them to support Ivan Asen III and envoys were dispatched to Tarnovo to arrange for his recognition and the surrender of Empress Maria. In the meantime, Ivan Asen III marched north {{at the head of a}} Byzantine army while Ivaylo was besieging Tarnovo.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} and ferocity of the German Ardennes Offensive <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> and Strong was criticised {{for failing to}} predict it. However Smith defended Strong against criticism for failing to sound the alarm, feeling that Strong have given ample warning, which had been discounted or disregarded by himself and others. By 19 December, Strong had become concerned that the Germans were going to split Bradley's armies, and he and Whiteley – who had already received Monty's opinion on the matter – went to Smith, recommending that the armies north of the Ardennes be transferred from Bradley to Montgomery's command. Smith realised the military and political implications of this, and knew that such a recommendation had to come from an American officer. On 20 December, Smith spoke to Eisenhower, who deferred judgement until the morning staff meeting. Eisenhower then phoned Bradley and Montgomery and ordered it. The decision was greatly resented by many Americans, particularly at 12th Army Group.|$|E
5|$|Mitch caused such {{massive and}} {{widespread}} damage that Honduran President Carlos Roberto Flores claimed it destroyed {{fifty years of}} progress in the country. Honduras, the country most affected by the hurricane, received significant aid for the millions impacted by the hurricane. Mexico quickly gave help, sending 700tons of food, 11tons of medicine, four rescue planes, rescue personnel, and trained search dogs. Cuba also volunteered, sending a contingent of physicians to the country. The U.S. administration offered at first troops stationed in Honduras, and then withdrew them {{a few days after}} the storm. They also at first offered only $2million (1998USD) in aid, which <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to residents, and president Carlos Roberto Flores alike. The U.S. later increased their offer to $70million (1998USD). The Honduran government distributed food, water, and medical services to the hurricane victims, including the more than 4million without water. In addition, the country initially experienced a sharp increase in the unemployment rate, largely due to the destruction of crop lands. However, rebuilding provided jobs in the following years. In Costa Rica, reconstruction after the hurricane increased the number of jobs by 5.9%, lowering the unemployment rate slightly.|$|E

50|$|Portraying a Samaritan in a {{positive}} light would have <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> to Jesus's audience.

Others, however, discount this allegory as unrelated to the parable's original meaning and see the parable as exemplifying the ethics of Jesus.|$|R

5|$|Rebuffed by Tarrasch, Lasker {{challenged}} the reigning World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz to {{a match for}} the title. Initially Lasker wanted to play for US $5,000 a side and a match was agreed at stakes of $3,000 a side, but Steinitz agreed {{to a series of}} reductions when Lasker found it difficult to raise the money. The final figure was $2,000, which was less than for some of Steinitz' earlier matches (the final combined stake of $4,000 would be worth over $495,000 at 2006 values). Although this was publicly praised as an act of sportsmanship on Steinitz' part, Steinitz may have desperately needed the money. The match was played in 1894, at venues in New York, Philadelphia, and Montreal. Steinitz had previously declared he would win without doubt, so it <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>shock</b> when Lasker won the first game. Steinitz responded by winning the second, and maintained the balance through the sixth. However, Lasker won all the games from the seventh to the eleventh, and Steinitz asked for a week's rest. When the match resumed, Steinitz looked in better shape and won the 13th and 14th games. Lasker struck back in the 15th and 16th, and Steinitz did not compensate for his losses {{in the middle of the}} match. Hence Lasker won convincingly with ten wins, five losses and four draws. Lasker thus became the second formally recognized World Chess Champion, and confirmed his title by beating Steinitz even more convincingly in their re-match in 1896–97 (ten wins, two losses, and five draws).|$|E

25|$|Branwell's health had {{deteriorated}} over two years, but its seriousness was disguised by his persistent drunkenness. He {{died on the}} morning of 24 September 1848.

The cause was recorded as chronic bronchitis – marasmus; though it is now believed he was suffering from tuberculosis.|$|E
