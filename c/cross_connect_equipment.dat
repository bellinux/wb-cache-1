Any error in optical-path routing due to failure in the <b>cross</b> <b>connect</b> can be detected without tapping off the power at the data wavelengths, and no dedicated monitoring light source is required. The scheme supports in-service surveillance. It can facilitate the network management in the optical layer of all-optical and reconfigurable transport networks.

50|$|An {{outgoing}} marker, being {{a complex}} control instrument {{with a short}} holding time, had the additional task of decoding the first three digits of the seven-digit telephone number to determine the routing to a distant exchange. A <b>cross</b> <b>connect</b> field had a terminal for each office code, which was <b>cross</b> <b>connected</b> to the coil of a route relay. When the office code point was grounded, it operated the route relay, whose contacts were wired in another <b>cross</b> <b>connect</b> or data field. Thus, the outgoing marker could select two office frames to search for idle trunks to the destination, and had pulsing information for the sender. The sender sent the telephone number to the distant terminating office. When one office was constructed, retired, or changed, staff in other offices received a Routing Letter, ordering the <b>cross</b> <b>connect</b> fields to be changed at a particular date and time, usually after midnight, to accommodate {{the change in the}} network. Translation <b>cross</b> <b>connect</b> fields such as these {{were among the first to}} be converted from soldered terminals to wire wrap.|$|R

40|$|MEMS based optical <b>cross</b> <b>connects</b> {{experience}} a growing market demand. They {{are used in}} optical fiber networks as well as optical measurement systems where they add functionality or increase {{the performance of the}} systems. 2 x 2 MEMS optical <b>cross</b> <b>connects</b> proved excellent performance and large optical <b>cross</b> <b>connects</b> with over 100 input and output channels are used to route the worldwide data traffic. However, large optical <b>cross</b> <b>connects</b> have a high cost. Medium sized optical <b>cross</b> <b>connects</b> having four to sixteen input and output ports and moderate price clearly cover an industry need. Therefore, the subject of this thesis is the development of a matrix type optical <b>cross</b> <b>connect</b> with four or eight input and output ports. The pitch of the individual mirrors was set to 250 µm to enable a simplified assembly to fiber ribbons. A novel two-sided etching process of 110 µm thin silicon wafers enabled to fabricate silicon structures with a high accuracy {{on both sides of the}} wafer. The optical mirrors are situated vertically on very compact actuators with a footprint of 250 x 250 µm 2. The actuators consist of a fixed electrode and a counterelectrode suspended by torsion beams with a diameter of 0. 8 µm. The simulation, fabrication and characterisation of microfabricated Graded Index lenses are presented. Theses lenses are needed to collimate the light exiting from the single-mode fibers, which is necessary to reduce losses originating from diffraction. The lenses are fabricated from a selected multi-mode fiber with a parabolic refractive index distribution in the fiber core. Since the diameter of the lenses equals the diameter of the signal carrying fibers they can be passively aligned in U-grooves that are etched into the silicon chip. The lenses yielded optical losses of less than 2 dB for a coupling length of 2 mm. The measurements of complete optical <b>cross</b> <b>connects</b> yielded encouraging results. The maximal operating frequency was measured to be larger than 200 Hz and the optical losses of some channels were close to the losses caused by the lenses, which means that the quality of the mirrors is good. However, some mirrors yielded losses that exceeded largely the targeted 3 dB. The reason was found to be the fragility of the silicon chip causing alignment problems after the assembly. A modification of the fabrication process allowing to fabricate more rigid mirror matrices is suggested...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} optical and electronic technologies in future high-capacity routers. In particular, optical and electronic technologies {{for use in the}} key router functions of buffering and switching are compared. The comparison is based on aggressive but plausible estimates of buffer and switch performance projected out to around 2020. The analysis of buffer technologies uses a new model of power dissipation in optical-delay-line buffers using optical fiber and planar waveguides, in-cluding slow-light waveguides. Using this model together with models of storage capacity in ideal and nonideal slow-light delay lines, the power dissipation and scaling characteristics of optical and electronic buffers are compared. The author concludes that planar integrated optical buffers occupy larger chip area than electronic buffers, dissipate more power than electronic buffers, and are limited in capacity to, at most, a few IP packets. Optical fiber-based buffers have lower power dissipation but are bulky. The author also concludes that electronic buffering will remain the technology of choice in future high-capacity routers. The power dissipation of high-capacity optical and electronic <b>cross</b> <b>connects</b> for a number of <b>cross</b> <b>connect</b> architectures is compared. The author shows that optical and electronic <b>cross</b> <b>connects</b> dissipate similar power and require a similar chip area. Optical technologies show a potential for inclusion in high-capacity routers, especially as the basis for arrayed-waveguide-grating-based <b>cross</b> <b>connects</b> and as components in E/O/E interconnects. A major challenge in large <b>cross</b> <b>connects,</b> both optical and electronic, will be to efficiently manage the very large number of interconnects between chips and boards. The general conclusion is that electronic tech-nologies are likely to remain as integral components in the signal transmission path of future high-capacity routers. There {{does not appear to be}} a compelling case for replacing electronic routers with optically transparent optical packet switches.
