5|$|Focusing on color terminology, with easily {{discernible}} {{differences between}} perception and vocabulary, Brown and Lenneberg published in 1954 {{a study of}} Zuni color terms that slightly support a weak effect of semantic categorization of color terms on <b>color</b> <b>perception.</b> In doing so they began a line of empirical studies that investigated the principle of linguistic relativity.|$|E
5|$|Any true {{physical}} color can {{be represented}} {{by a combination of}} pure spectral colors. As physical colors can be composed of any number of physical colors, the space of physical colors may aptly be represented by a Hilbert space over spectral colors. Humans have three types of cone cells for <b>color</b> <b>perception,</b> so the perceivable colors {{can be represented}} by 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The non-unique linear mapping from the Hilbert space of physical colors to the Euclidean space of human perceivable colors explains why many distinct physical colors may be perceived by humans to be identical (e.g., pure yellow light versus a mix of red and green light).|$|E
25|$|Thus human <b>color</b> <b>perception</b> is {{determined}} by a specific, non-unique linear mapping from the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space Hcolor to the 3-dimensional Euclidean space R3color.|$|E

50|$|The {{scientist}} Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) {{carried out}} experiments in visual perception {{and the other}} senses, including variations in sensitivity, sensation of touch, <b>perception</b> of <b>colors,</b> <b>perception</b> of darkness, the psychological explanation of the moon illusion, and binocular vision. Al-Biruni also employed such experimental methods in examining reaction time.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} <b>color</b> <b>perceptions</b> that by {{definition}} cannot be pure spectral colors due to desaturation {{or because they}} are purples (mixtures of red and violet light, from {{opposite ends of the}} spectrum). Some examples of necessarily non-spectral colors are the achromatic colors (black, gray, and white) and colors such as pink, tan, and magenta.|$|R
25|$|It {{remains unknown}} whether the Abney {{effect is a}} {{resulting}} phenomenon that occurs by chance during <b>color</b> <b>perception</b> or the effect plays a deliberate function {{in the way the}} eye codes for color.|$|E
25|$|Erwin Schrödinger, a {{theoretical}} physicist {{and one of}} the leading pioneers of quantum mechanics, also published in the areas of colorimetry and <b>color</b> <b>perception.</b> In several of his philosophical writings, he defends the notion that qualia are not physical.|$|E
25|$|In {{locations}} {{with little}} light pollution, the moonlit night sky is also blue, because moonlight is reflected sunlight, {{with a slightly}} lower color temperature due to the brownish color of the moon. The moonlit sky is not perceived as blue, however, because at low light levels human vision comes mainly from rod cells that do not produce any <b>color</b> <b>perception</b> (Purkinje effect).|$|E
50|$|During the {{emergence}} of Neo-Impressionism, Seurat and his followers strove to refine the impulsive and intuitive artistic mannerisms of Impressionism. Neo-impressionists used disciplined networks of dots and blocks of color in their desire to instill a sense of organization and permanence. In further defining the movement, Seurat incorporated the recent explanation of optic and <b>color</b> <b>perceptions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Similarly, {{most human}} <b>color</b> <b>perceptions</b> can be {{generated}} by a mixture of three colors called primaries. This is used to reproduce color scenes in photography, printing, television, and other media. There {{are a number of}} methods or color spaces for specifying a color in terms of three particular primary colors. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the particular application.|$|R

25|$|There are {{a number}} of color {{distance}} formulae that attempt to use color spaces like HSV with the hue as a circle, placing the various colors within a three dimensional space of either a cylinder or cone, but most of these are just modifications of RGB without accounting for differences in human <b>color</b> <b>perception</b> they will tend to be on par with a simple Euclidean metric.|$|E
25|$|Color {{temperature}} can be {{indicated in}} kelvins or mireds (1 million {{divided by the}} color temperature in kelvins). The color temperature of a light source is the temperature of a black body that has the same chromaticity (i.e. color) as the light source. A notional temperature, the correlated color temperature, the temperature of a black body which emits light of a hue which to human <b>color</b> <b>perception</b> most closely matches {{the light from the}} lamp, is assigned.|$|E
25|$|Many other light sources, such as {{fluorescent}} lamps, or LEDs (light emitting diodes) emit light {{primarily by}} processes other than thermal radiation. This {{means that the}} emitted radiation does not follow {{the form of a}} black-body spectrum. These sources are assigned what is known as a correlated color temperature (CCT). CCT is the color temperature of a black-body radiator which to human <b>color</b> <b>perception</b> most closely matches the light from the lamp. Because such an approximation is not required for incandescent light, the CCT for an incandescent light is simply its unadjusted temperature, derived from comparison to a black-body radiator.|$|E

A controversy involving Bales' influence at Harding, a dispute between Bales and a Harding Professor named James Atteberry, is also covered in Hicks' book.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this case {{study was to explore}} {{perceptions}} of students of color have regarding their experiences in college classrooms at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). The central areas of inquiry concerned students 2 ̆ 7 of <b>color</b> <b>perceptions</b> of the social interactions among students and faculty, and their perceptions of the curriculum as well as how students 2 ̆ 7 gender and/or race might influence both. The research questions for this study examined students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions across five dimensions of classroom environment: student learning style/preferences, instruction, student-student (group) activities, curriculum, and instructor-student interactions. ^ This study serves as a continuation of the findings of a quantitative pilot study conducted during the spring semester of 1999 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Ten students of color, representing members of four minority groups (African American, Asian American, Mexican American, and Native American), were interviewed and results analyzed to examine their perceptions on the five dimensions of classroom environment. ^ In addition, data were analyzed that led to several emergent themes from this case study and recent research relating to students 2 ̆ 7 of <b>color</b> <b>perceptions</b> of their college classroom experiences/environments (e. g., learning style/preference, instruction, curriculum, student-student interaction, and instructor-student interaction) was reviewed.

25|$|The {{observer}} would {{alter the}} brightness {{of each of the}} three primary beams until a match to the test color was observed. Not all test colors could be matched using this technique. When this was the case, a variable amount of one of the primaries could be added to the test color, and a match with the remaining two primaries was carried out with the variable color spot. For these cases, the amount of the primary added to the test color was considered to be a negative value. In this way, the entire range of human <b>color</b> <b>perception</b> could be covered. When the test colors were monochromatic, a plot could be made of the amount of each primary used {{as a function of the}} wavelength of the test color. These three functions are called the color matching functions for that particular experiment.|$|E
25|$|Transduction is {{the process}} through which energy from {{environmental}} stimuli is converted to neural activity for the brain to understand and process. The back of the eye contains three different cell layers: photoreceptor layer, bipolar cell layer and ganglion cell layer. The photoreceptor layer {{is at the very}} back and contains rod photoreceptors and cone photoreceptors. Cones are responsible for <b>color</b> <b>perception.</b> There are three different cones: red, green and blue. Rods, are responsible for the perception of objects in low light. Photoreceptors contain within them a special chemical called a photopigment, which are embedded in the membrane of the lamellae; a single human rod contains approximately 10 million of them. The photopigment molecules consist of two parts: an opsin (a protein) and retinal (a lipid). There are 3 specific photopigments (each with their own color) that respond to specific wavelengths of light. When the appropriate wavelength of light hits the photoreceptor, its photopigment splits into two, which sends a message to the bipolar cell layer, which in turn sends a message to the ganglion cells, which then send the information through the optic nerve to the brain. If the appropriate photopigment is not in the proper photoreceptor (for example, a green photopigment inside a red cone), a condition called color vision deficiency will occur.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{confusion}} concerning modularity exists in neuroscience because there is evidence for specific areas (e.g. V4 or V5/hMT+) and the concomitant behavioral deficits following brain insult (thus taken as evidence for modularity). In addition, evidence shows other areas are involved and that these areas subserve processing of multiple properties (e.g. V1) (thus taken as evidence against modularity). That these streams have the same implementation in early visual areas, like V1, is not inconsistent with a modular viewpoint: to adopt the canonical analogy in cognition, {{it is possible for}} different software to run on the same hardware. A consideration of psychophysics and neuropsychological data would suggest support for this. For example, psychophysics has shown that percepts for different properties are realized asynchronously. In addition, although achromats experience other cognitive defects they do not have motion deficits when their lesion is restricted to V4, or total loss of form perception. Relatedly, Zihl and colleagues' akinetopsia patient shows no deficit to color or object perception (although deriving depth and structure from motion is problematic, see above) and object agnostics do not have damaged motion or <b>color</b> <b>perception,</b> making the three disorders triply dissociable. Taken together this evidence suggests that even though distinct properties may employ the same early visual areas they are functionally independent. Furthermore, that the intensity of subjective perceptual experience (e.g. color) correlates with activity in these specific areas (e.g. V4), the recent evidence that synaesthetes show V4 activation during the perceptual experience of color, as well as the fact that damage to these areas results in concomitant behavioral deficits (the processing may be occurring but perceivers {{do not have access to}} the information) are all evidence for visual modularity.|$|E

5000|$|Unique hue is a {{term used}} in certain {{theories}} of color vision, which implies that human perception distinguishes between [...] "unique" [...] (psychologically primary) and composite (mixed) hues. A unique hue {{is defined as a}} color which an observer perceives as a pure, without any admixture of the other colors. There {{is a great deal of}} variability when defining unique hues experimentally. Often the results show a great deal of interobserver and intraobserver variability leading to much debate on the number of unique hues. Another source of variability is environmental factors in color naming. Despite the inconsistencies, often four <b>color</b> <b>perceptions</b> are associated as unique; [...] "red", [...] "green", [...] "blue", and [...] "yellow".|$|R

[...] The painting features one of the first examples of Monet's use of colored shadows, which would later become associated with the Impressionist movement. Monet and the Impressionists used colored shadows to represent the actual, changing conditions of light and shadow as seen in nature, challenging the academic convention of painting shadows black. This subjective theory of <b>color</b> <b>perception</b> was introduced to the art world through the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Michel Eugène Chevreul earlier in the century.|$|E

Dermal patches provide the character with beneficial effects—such as regeneration or increased melee attack power—but can cause detrimental side-effects, such as fatigue and distorted <b>color</b> <b>perception.</b> Attachable [...] "hardware" [...] may also be found, including energy shields and head-mounted lanterns. Increasingly advanced versions of this hardware may be obtained as the game progresses. When activated, most hardware drains from a main energy reserve, which necessitates economization. Certain hardware displays the effectiveness of attacks when active, with messages such as [...] "Normal damage". When an enemy is attacked, the damage is calculated by armor absorption, vulnerabilities, critical hits and a degree of randomness. Weapons and munitions deal specific kinds of damage, and certain enemies are immune, or more vulnerable, to particular types. For example, electromagnetic pulse weapons heavily damage robots, but do not affect mutants. Conversely, gas grenades are effective against mutants, but do not damage robots.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Color</b> <b>perception</b> {{mechanisms}} are {{highly dependent on}} evolutionary factors, of which the most prominent {{is thought to be}} satisfactory recognition of food sources. In herbivorous primates, <b>color</b> <b>perception</b> is essential for finding proper (immature) leaves. In hummingbirds, particular flower types are often recognized by color as well. On the other hand, nocturnal mammals have less-developed color vision, since adequate light is needed for cones to function properly. There is evidence that ultraviolet light plays a part in <b>color</b> <b>perception</b> in many branches of the animal kingdom, especially insects.

Papilio butterflies possess six types of photoreceptors and may have pentachromatic vision.

40|$|Objective of the Study The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to analyze what kinds of feelings and reactions visual communication on six distinct websites resonate in young Finnish adults. The aim was to investigate the associations which Finnish young adults would have with specific colors and images and whether these features support the mission of each of the three different charity organizations. Furthermore, the study concentrates on evaluating the differences between the reactions toward local and global versions of the organizations’ websites; is it beneficial for an organization to modify their websites based on local cultures? Methodology and the Theoretical Framework The theoretical framework is based on previous studies of Finnish <b>color</b> <b>perceptions</b> and studies which elaborated on the use of images in visual communication. The data for the study were gathered by creating an Internet based survey and distributing it through email and social media to various Finnish nationals in the age group of 20 - 29 -years-old. The survey respondents were asked to identify their personal color preferences and several color associations. Furthermore, they were asked to visit six different websites and describe their reactions to their visual communication. Findings and Conclusion The findings supported the previous studies of Finnish <b>color</b> <b>perceptions,</b> although some differences occurred. The study implies that all three charity organizations are identified in a very distinct manner based on the visual communication on their local and global websites. The results of the study show that young Finnish adults who participated in the survey prefer clear and simple visual communication on websites. These website visitors are more likely to become interested in the site if the images portray people in action. Static images were preferred to rotating ones, as the study shows that rotating images contribute to the perception of “messiness” on the site...|$|R
2500|$|Similar {{converging}} {{evidence suggests}} modularity for color. Beginning with Gowers’ finding [...] that {{damage to the}} fusiform/lingual gyri in occipitotemporal cortex correlates with a loss in <b>color</b> <b>perception</b> (achromatopsia), {{the notion of a}} [...] "color centre" [...] in the primate brain has had growing support. Again, such clinical evidence only implies that this region is critical to <b>color</b> <b>perception,</b> and nothing more. Other evidence, however, including neuroimaging and physiology converges on V4 as necessary to <b>color</b> <b>perception.</b> A recent meta-analysis has also shown a specific lesion common to achromats corresponding to V4. From another direction altogether it has been found that when synaesthetes experience color by a non-visual stimulus, V4 is active. On the basis of this evidence it would seem that color processing is modular. However, as with motion processing it is likely that this conclusion is inaccurate. Other evidence shown in Table 3 implies different areas’ involvement with color. It may thus be more instructive to consider a multistage color processing stream from the retina through to cortical areas including at least V1, V2, V4, PITd and TEO. Consonant with motion perception, {{there appears to be a}} constellation of areas drawn upon for <b>color</b> <b>perception.</b> In addition, V4 may have a special, but not exclusive, role. For example, single cell recording has shown that only V4 cells respond to the color of a stimuli rather than its waveband, whereas other areas involved with color do not.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "domain-centered" [...] {{approach}} {{selects a}} semantic domain and compares it across linguistic and cultural groups.

2500|$|Most placental mammals {{other than}} {{primates}} {{have only two}} types of color photoreceptor and are therefore dichromats, so {{it is possible that}} certain combinations of just two primaries might cover some significant gamut relative to the range of their <b>color</b> <b>perception.</b> [...] Meanwhile, birds and marsupials have four color photoreceptors in their eyes, and hence are tetrachromats.

40|$|Instability in {{the color}} {{appreciation}} of monochromatic flashes for a normal trichromat is studied {{with respect to the}} instability in the stimulus due to the statistical fluctuation in the number of incident quanta and the distribution of this number over the retinal receptors.

By comparison with the quantum theoretical studies conducted previously for absolute threshold values, it is found that for green excitation, three quanta, and for red, two quanta are required for a <b>colored</b> <b>perception.</b> For the long wave end two systems are sensitive, a “red” and a “colorless” system.
