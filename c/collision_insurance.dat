50|$|Some drivers opt {{to buy the}} {{insurance}} {{as a means of}} protection against costly breakdowns unrelated to an accident. In contrast to more standard and basic coverages such as comprehensive and <b>collision</b> <b>insurance,</b> auto repair insurance does not cover a vehicle when it is damaged in a collision, during a natural disaster or at the hands of vandals.|$|E

50|$|CAFE neither {{directly}} offers {{incentives for}} customers to choose fuel efficient vehicles nor directly affects fuel prices. Rather, {{it attempts to}} accomplish the goals indirectly, by making it more expensive for automakers to build inefficient vehicles by introducing penalties.The conservative Heartland Institute contends that CAFE standards do not work economically to consumers' benefit, smaller cars {{are more likely to}} be damaged in a <b>collision,</b> and <b>insurance</b> premiums for them are higher than for many larger cars. However, the Insurance Companies' Highway Loss Data Institute publishes data showing that larger vehicles are more expensive to insure.|$|R
25|$|The Insurance Fraud Bureau in the UK {{estimated}} {{there have}} already been more than 20,000 staged <b>collisions</b> and false <b>insurance</b> claims across the UK from 1999 to 2006. One tactic fraudsters use is to drive to a busy junction or roundabout and brake sharply causing a motorist to drive {{into the back of}} them. They claim the other motorist was at fault because they were driving too fast or too close behind them, and make a false and inflated claim to the motorist's insurer for whiplash and damage which can give the fraudsters up to £30,000. In the Insurance Fraud Bureau's first year or operation, the usage of data mining initiatives exposed insurance fraud networks and led to 74 arrests and a five-to-one return on investment.|$|R

Regarding life insurance, everyone dies, but what if the death occurs after the first payment of a premium for life insurance? they win and the insurance company loses.)

40|$|British Columbia, Canada is a {{geographically}} large jurisdiction with varied {{environmental and}} socio-cultural contexts. This cross-sectional study examined variation in motor vehicle crash rates across 100 police patrols {{to investigate the}} association of crashes with key explanatory factors. Eleven crash outcomes (total crashes, injury crashes, fatal crashes, speed related fatal crashes, total fatalities, single-vehicle night-time crashes, rear-end collisions, and collisions involving heavy vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists) were identified from police <b>collision</b> reports and <b>insurance</b> claims and mapped to police patrols. Six potential explanatory factors (intensity of traffic law enforcement, speed limits, climate, remoteness, socio-economic factors, and alcohol consumption) were also mapped to police patrols. We then studied the association between crashes and explanatory factors using negative binomial models with crash count per patrol as the response variable and explanatory factors as covariates. Between 2003 and 2012 there were 1, 434, 239 <b>insurance</b> claim <b>collisions,</b> 386, 326 police reported crashes, and 3, 404 fatal crashes. Across police patrols, there was marked variation in per capita crash rate and in potential explanatory factors. Several factors were associated with crash rates. Percent roads with speed limits ≤ 60 km/hr was positively associated with total crashes, injury crashes, rear end collisions, and collisions involving pedestrians, cyclists, and heavy vehicles; and negatively associated with single vehicle night-time crashes, fatal crashes, fatal speeding crashes, and total fatalities. Higher winter temperature was associated with lower rates of overall collisions, single vehicle night-time collisions, collisions involving heavy vehicles, and total fatalities. Lower socio-economic status was associated with higher rates of injury collisions, pedestrian collisions, fatal speeding collisions, and fatal collisions. Regions with dedicated traffic officers had fewer fatal crashes and fewer fatal speed related crashes but more rear end crashes and more crashes involving cyclists or pedestrians. The number of traffic citations per 1000 drivers was positively associated with total crashes, fatal crashes, total fatalities, fatal speeding crashes, injury crashes, single vehicle night-time crashes, and heavy vehicle crashes. Possible explanations for these associations are discussed. There is wide variation in per capita rates of motor vehicle crashes across BC police patrols. Some variation is explained by factors such as climate, road type, remoteness, socioeconomic variables, and enforcement intensity. The ability of explanatory factors to predict crash rates would be improved if considered with local traffic volume by all travel modes...|$|R
40|$|Many insurance-related {{decisions}} appear, {{at first}} glance, to be suboptimal. For example, many people pay added premiums that seem excessive to obtain automobile <b>collision</b> <b>insurance</b> {{with a low}} deductible.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{implications}} of endogenous product quality (and therefore endogenous output) in the empirical estimation of cost functions for regulated automobile <b>collision</b> <b>insurance</b> firms. It contains a structural model of such a firm and provides an illustration {{of the types of}} biases that can result if data on quality of service are unavailable or otherwise omitted. The analysis shows how the directions of biases depend {{on the nature of the}} variations in the observed (nonquality) data. A new test suggests that such bias is present in insurance cost functions. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{configuration}} of equilibrium {{in the market}} for automobile <b>collision</b> <b>insurance</b> is examined empirically by representing the premium-deductible menu and the demand function as a standard hedonic system. Using contractual data from a representative insurer, the authors estimate a reduced-form hedonic premium equation and the inverse of the marginal bid equation for insurance coverage. The data reveal an equilibrium with adverse selection and market signaling but lead the authors to reject the hypothesis that high risks receive contracts subsidized by low risks.

40|$|Auto {{insurance}} {{belongs to}} the most important areas of the insurance market from the quantitative {{point of view and}} based on its significance in covering auto-related risks. The significance of damage impact, particularly in liability insurance, requires a high degree of regulation. Standard products, auto liability and <b>collision</b> <b>insurance</b> are following the overall changes in insurance policies and are adjusting to the changing conditions. One of the major issues in the auto insurance in the Czech Republic and internationally is a toughening competition which results in changing insurance premiums. At the same time, new forms of auto insurance are introduced due to technological advances and demands for higher coverage...|$|E
40|$|The Year 2000 {{problem has}} forced the {{insurance}} industry world-wide to re-examine the impact of software quality on business-related insurance. Traditionally, corporations have purchased insurance to protect against hazards such as natural disasters and other calamities. But software and other IT problems are forcing businesses to face {{a new type of}} hazard, and the insurance industry has been reluctant to offer appropriate protections against these hazards. 1 Introduction Risk can be divided into two types: speculative and pure [4, 6]. Speculative risk can either result in a loss or a profit. An example is buying company stock. With pure risk the only potential consequence is loss. An example is automobile <b>collision</b> <b>insurance.</b> Insurance gives companies that produce goods and services an opportunity to order their business affairs so that a certain cost (premiums) are substituted for an uncertain cost (potentially disastrous loss of unacceptable magnitude). The ability to acquire insura [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Most {{insurance}} products pay indemnities based on actual losses incurred by the policyholder (e. g., automobile <b>collision</b> <b>insurance,</b> {{property and casualty}} insurance, etc.). This is also true of many Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP) {{insurance products}} that pay indemnities based on farm-level yield or revenue shortfalls. Yet for some commodities, such as hay, yield measurement is difficult and often imprecise, especially at the farm-level. Further, since the commodity is frequently used on the farm, rather than sold in the market, sales documents are often not available to verify historic production (and hence, yield) estimates. For other commodities (e. g., pasture and rangeland) farm-level yield measurement is practically impossible. How can one offer insurance protection for these commodities? USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA) is currently investigating whether new index insurance designs based on weather variables (e. g., precipitation) can provide farmers with useful risk protection in these situations. Index insurance products pay indemnities based {{on the value of}} an index rather than on actual losses experienced by the farmer. Even when it is possible to measure yield, index insurance products may offer som...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to develop an appropriate analytical basis for evaluating the illegal activity exclusion in the context of automobile comprehensive coverage. Because the illegal activity exclusion has not been the subject of any reported decision in the context of comprehensive coverage, this article attempts to achieve its goal by examining intentional injury and prohibitive use exclusions in the context of automobile liability and collision coverages, respectively. The purpose of this examination is to ascertain whether the analytical tools employed in the liability and collision coverages arenas are appropriate in the context of the primary thesis. Part II of this article details the most significant provisions of automobile insurance contracts. This part, though primarily introductory in nature, reflects the skepticism with which courts view attempts by insurers to limit coverage in general. Part II explores the intentional injury exclusion in the context of automobile liability insurance. This part attempts to identify the methodologies used by courts in assessing the validity of the exclusion. Part II demonstrates how public policy influences the manner in which courts construe the intentional injury exclusion, and concludes that the analytical standards used to determine the validity of such exclusions reflect the policy concerns inherent in mandatory automobile liability insurance. Part III examines prohibitive use restrictions contained in car rental agreements. Part III explores the relationship between collision damage waivers, prohibitive use provisions, and <b>collision</b> <b>insurance</b> policies in general. This part demonstrates that the validity of prohibitive use provisions contained in rental car agreements, though not technically insurance contracts, is determined according to general principles of insurance contract interpretation. Part III also details the analytical standards used by courts to assess the validity of prohibitive use restrictions. Parts IV and V document the relationship between collision and comprehensive coverages. They also examine the collision and comprehensive coverages insuring agreement. This insuring agreement affords coverage only for 2 ̆ 2 direct and accidental loss. 2 ̆ 2 The primary thesis emanates out of the difficulty of formulating a universal all-inclusive definition of the term 2 ̆ 2 accidental. 2 ̆ 2 Parts IV and V discuss the general rule that 2 ̆ 2 accidental 2 ̆ 2 for purposes of collision and comprehensive coverage is ascertained from the perspective of the insured. It also recognizes the presumption of validity generally accorded to property coverages exclusions. This presumption, however, merely favors the rights of insurers to include such provisions in the respective coverages and does not determine whether such exclusions are enforceable in the context of a specific case. Two conclusions are reached. First, a case-by-case approach should be used to determine if an insurer is relieved from its obligation to provide comprehensive coverage when (1) a vehicle has been used in an unlawful manner, or (2) an unlawful event may have occurred during its use by an insured. Second, traditional tools of insurance contract interpretations should be used to determine whether an accident has occurred for purposes of comprehensive coverage...|$|E
