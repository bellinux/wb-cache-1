5|$|Renewed {{interest}} in copper and nickel mining in northern Minnesota {{has also been}} a source of tension. While the mines would be situated south and west of the BWCAW, concerns about runoff that <b>could</b> <b>ultimately</b> enter the BWCAW's watershed have caused concerns among environmental and conservationist groups. A 2015 bill proposed by Representative Betty McCollum seeks to block nearby mining.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 {{study by}} {{researchers}} at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography concluded that the imbalance between global dimming and global warming at the surface leads to weaker turbulent heat fluxes to the atmosphere. This means globally reduced evaporation and hence precipitation occur in a dimmer and warmer world, which <b>could</b> <b>ultimately</b> lead to a more humid atmosphere in which it rains less.|$|E
5|$|In captivity, only Campbell's dwarf hamsters and Djungarian hamsters {{are able}} to interbreed and produce live {{offspring}} or hybrids. Although hybrids make suitable pets, the breeding of hybrids and cloning can cause health problems, due to inherited diseases. Because genetic information can be very similar, genetic health problems or vulnerabilities can easily be inherited by the offspring. The widespread breeding and distribution of hybrids could threaten the existence of both pure species and subspecies of the ecosystem. This <b>could</b> <b>ultimately</b> lead to the extinction of the subspecies. Each litter becomes smaller as more generations are produced and the young commonly begin to inherit many congenital problems.|$|E
50|$|Following Democritean atomism, the {{mechanical}} {{philosophy of the}} 17th century posited that all forces <b>could</b> be <b>ultimately</b> reduced to contact forces between the atoms, then imagined as tiny solid particles.|$|R
50|$|Elements of the {{regiment}} fought {{as long as}} they <b>could</b> but <b>ultimately</b> surrendered to the Soviet General Vasiljev on 29 or 30 January 1943. In the three months between 21 October 1942 and 21 January 1943 they had lost 540 of 983 troops fighting for the Red October factory.|$|R
5000|$|Icelandic {{communities}} {{in other countries}} may have lower levels of belief in huldufólk. Daisy L. Neijmann claims that among Icelanders in Canada, [...] "Belief in these creatures... was geographically bound seeing that {{they were part of}} the Icelandic landscape, and therefore they <b>could</b> not, <b>ultimately,</b> survive among Icelandic Canadians." ...|$|R
5|$|The X-Files is an American science fictionsupernatural {{television}} series that originally aired on the Fox network from September 10, 1993 to May 19, 2002. The series centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, and the skeptical Scully is assigned to make scientific analyses of Mulder's discoveries which <b>could</b> <b>ultimately</b> be used to discredit his work. Throughout the series the two develop a close friendship. During the eighth and ninth seasons of the series, Duchovny's role was reduced from lead actor to an intermittent lead role.|$|E
5|$|Renaudin, {{seeing the}} hapless {{condition}} of his ship, ordered his flags hoisted half-mast in surrender and distress around 14:00, but after her surrender no British ship {{managed to get}} men aboard to take possession. This left Vengeurs few remaining unwounded crew to attempt to salvage what they <b>could.</b> <b>Ultimately</b> the ship's pumps became unmanageable, and Vengeur began to sink. Only the timely arrival of boats from the undamaged HMS Alfred and Culloden, {{as well as the}} services of the cutter Rattler, saved any of the Vengeur's crew from drowning, these ships taking off nearly 500 sailors between them. Lieutenant John Winne of Rattler was especially commended for this hazardous work. By 18:15, Vengeur was clearly beyond salvage and only the very worst of the wounded and the dead remained aboard, though some possibly stayed aboard in the hope of being rescued by a French ship rather than a British and avoid captivity.|$|E
5|$|When the Persians {{arrived at}} Thermopylae in mid-August, they {{initially}} waited {{for three days}} for the Allies to disperse. When Xerxes was eventually persuaded that the Allies intended to contest the pass, he sent his troops to attack. However, the Greek position was ideally suited to hoplite warfare, the Persian contingents being forced to attack the phalanx head on. The Allies thus withstood two full days of battle and everything Xerxes could throw at them. However, {{at the end of}} the second day, they were betrayed by a local resident named Ephialtes who revealed to Xerxes a mountain path that led behind the Allied lines. Xerxes then sent his elite guards, the Immortals on a night march to outflank the Allied. When he was made aware of this maneuver (while the Immortals were still en route), Leonidas dismissed the bulk of the Allied army, remaining to guard the rear with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebians and perhaps a few hundred others. On the third day of the battle, the remaining Allies sallied forth from the wall to meet the Persians and slaughter as many as they <b>could.</b> <b>Ultimately,</b> however, the Allied rearguard was annihilated, and the pass of Thermopylae opened to the Persians.|$|E
50|$|The Evian Accords {{that gave}} Boupacha her freedom {{also meant that}} her torturers {{received}} the same immunity, who <b>ultimately</b> <b>could</b> not be prosecuted.|$|R
50|$|His {{tenure as}} Mayor of Corrientes led to controversy, however, when Aguad took an US$60 million loan to cancel Cecacor bonds {{previously}} {{issued by the}} province. The bonds, which had declined to junk status, <b>could</b> not <b>ultimately</b> be redeemed by the city government, and in 2009, Aguad was indicted for misfeasance related to their handling.|$|R
5000|$|Jaudon {{was noted}} as a skilled [...] "financial diplomat" [...] {{who managed to}} keep European capital flowing to the Bank amid the Panic of 1837, his efforts to abet U.S. cotton speculation, and dubious bond sales, but <b>could</b> not <b>ultimately</b> keep the bank afloat. It {{suspended}} payments in late 1839, and closed in 1841.|$|R
25|$|Upon {{entering}} the NBA, Fredette {{struggled to find}} his game, with Yahoo Sports' Michael Lee noting that Fredette's inability to adjust from being a scorer to more of a role player <b>could</b> <b>ultimately</b> usher an end to his career.|$|E
25|$|Early {{bicycles}} were {{an example}} of conspicuous consumption, being adopted by the fashionable elites. In addition, by serving as a platform for accessories, which <b>could</b> <b>ultimately</b> cost more than the bicycle itself, it {{paved the way for}} the likes of the Barbie doll.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Anthony founded North American Soccer League {{expansion}} club Puerto Rico FC. Despite {{the financial}} recession in Puerto Rico, Anthony saw this opportunity {{as a form}} of community outreach, as well as a long-term investment in a club that <b>could</b> <b>ultimately</b> be profitable.|$|E
50|$|In 1495, Hermann became coadjutor {{bishop of}} the Prince-Bishopric of Paderborn. He was elected Prince-Bishop of Paderborn on 7 March 1498. He set himself against Philip of Cleves, Dean of Strasbourg Cathedral and his brother John II, Duke of Cleves but <b>could</b> not <b>ultimately</b> prevail. Hermann was allied with Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor and Pope Alexander VI.|$|R
5000|$|Boise State quarterback Kellen Moore led the Broncos to a 37-26 {{win over}} Air Force, giving him 45 career wins as a starter. This tied the FBS record of Texas' Colt McCoy (2006-2009); after a bye week, Moore <b>could</b> (and <b>ultimately</b> did) take sole {{possession}} of the record at UNLV on November 5. He finished his career 50-3.|$|R
50|$|The {{breakwater}} {{was after}} this not continued with, {{as it was}} generally accepted that the calculations and more importantly the method of construction were wrong and that no benefit <b>could</b> be <b>ultimately</b> expected with its continuation.An easterly storm with associated snow {{on the night of}} Saturday 5 January 1867, swept away the remaining portion of the breakwater leaving the structure completely demolished.|$|R
25|$|In {{the design}} of a dam the energy of the fast-flowing stream over a {{spillway}} must be partially dissipated to prevent erosion of the streambed downstream of the spillway, which <b>could</b> <b>ultimately</b> lead to failure of the dam. This can be done by arranging for the formation of a hydraulic jump to dissipate energy. To limit damage, this hydraulic jump normally occurs on an apron engineered to withstand hydraulic forces and to prevent local cavitation and other phenomena which accelerate erosion.|$|E
25|$|Art Tatum died on November 5, 1956, at Queen of Angels Medical Center in Los Angeles, from {{complications}} of uremia (as {{a result of}} kidney failure). He was originally interred at Angelus Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles, but was moved by his wife, Geraldine Tatum, to the Great Mausoleum of Glendale's Forest Lawn Cemetery in 1991, so she <b>could</b> <b>ultimately</b> be buried next to him, although his headstone was left at Rosedale to commemorate where he was first laid to rest.|$|E
25|$|Spain gave {{permission}} in August 2014 for Repsol and {{its partners}} to explore oil and gas prospects off the Canary Islands, involving an investment of €7.5 billion over four years, to commence {{at the end of}} 2016. Repsol at the time said the area <b>could</b> <b>ultimately</b> produce 100,000 barrels of oil a day, which would meet 10 percent of Spain's energy needs. However, the analysis of samples obtained did not show the necessary volume nor quality to consider future extraction, and the project was scrapped.|$|E
50|$|The opening move of the Carthaginians {{to create}} a {{fortified}} position on the hill <b>could</b> have <b>ultimately</b> helped their position. The base was sound, but the natural features (ravines and rugged outcrops) neutralized the most potent element of the Carthaginians land forces, their cavalry and elephants. Consequently, the Roman army saw an opportunity to exploit their heavy infantry to smash the trapped enemy.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of lakes in the {{watershed}} of Buttermilk Creek. Major ones include Fords Lake on Buttermilk Creek itself and Lake Winola, which has an area of approximately 190 acre, on one of its tributaries. A 140 acre reservoir on the creek 0.25 mi upstream of its mouth was proposed in the 1970s. It <b>could</b> have <b>ultimately</b> provided 109,000 recreation days per year.|$|R
5000|$|He then {{sought help}} from St. Andrew's Church in Islamabad, {{where he was}} {{provided}} refuge. One Sunday, he met a man known as [...] "Mr. Smith," [...] {{who claimed to be}} a distant friend. Tochi claimed Smith gave him pocket money and food and offered to help him obtain a visa in Dubai. However, Tochi <b>could</b> not <b>ultimately</b> obtain the visa because he did not meet the appropriate requirements.|$|R
25|$|Cortical {{thickness}} {{and reduced}} white matter – {{in a recent}} study, voxel-based morphometry, an imaging technique used to explore structural differences in the brain, revealed a decrease in white matter concentration in the right inferior frontal gyrus of amusic individuals as compared to controls. Lack of extensive exposure to music could be a contributing factor to this white matter reduction. For example, amusic individuals may be less inclined {{to listen to music}} than others, which <b>could</b> <b>ultimately</b> cause reduced myelination of connections to the frontal areas of the brain.|$|E
25|$|In 2016 Casey Stoner {{returned}} to the Ducati Corse Team as a test rider for the 2016 MotoGP season, ending his five-year tenure with Honda. Stoner's main role with Ducati is being a test rider {{and it has been}} further proposed that he may appear in some races as a wild card entry. Whether it <b>could</b> <b>ultimately</b> lead to a 2017 permanent return is yet undisclosed. Stoner participated in the official pre-season tests at Malaysia and was the fastest Ducati rider on the grid. He finished the final day of testing with the 5th-best time overall.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opening}} {{weeks of the}} war, Japan conquered the Philippines and the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia. The Japanese advance reached its maximum extent by June 1942, when the U.S. Navy scored a decisive victory at the Battle of Midway. American and Australian forces then began a slow and costly {{progress}} called island hopping or leapfrogging through the Pacific Islands, {{with the objective of}} gaining bases from which strategic airpower could be brought to bear on Japan and from which Japan <b>could</b> <b>ultimately</b> be invaded. In contrast to Hitler, Roosevelt took no direct part in the tactical naval operations, though he approved strategic decisions. Roosevelt gave way in part to insistent demands from the public and Congress that more effort be devoted against Japan; he always insisted on Germany first. The strength of the Japanese navy was decimated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and by April 1945 the Allies had re-captured much of their lost territory in the Pacific.|$|E
50|$|The Land Rover, {{which had}} {{actually}} entered army service before the Champ (as early as 1949), was half the price, simpler {{to maintain and}} could do 80% of the tasks the Champ <b>could</b> do. <b>Ultimately</b> it replaced the Champ in all roles. The Champ served with the British Army in the UK, Africa, Germany, Cyprus, Libya and the Suez Campaign, and early vehicles were sent for troop trials {{at the end of}} the Korean War.|$|R
50|$|Yet {{the artists}} <b>could</b> not <b>ultimately</b> prevent the {{destruction}} of the other buildings and the sale of the estate - in December 1986, the Karlsruhe City Council authorised the premises to be demolished, including the enormous art installations in the industrial buildings. For their gesamtkunstwerk (total work of art) KUNSTRAUM IWKA, the artists group were awarded a project grant by the Kunstfond (Arts Fund) Bonn, which entailed a documentary exhibition in Bonn.|$|R
50|$|Although the pharaoh {{defeated}} them, Egypt <b>could</b> not <b>ultimately</b> {{prevent them}} from settling in the eastern parts of their empire decades later. With this conflict, and a subsequent second battle with invading Libyan tribes in Year 11 of Ramesses III, Egypt's treasury became so depleted {{that she would never}} fully recover her imperial power. The Egyptian Empire over Asia and Nubia would be permanently lost less than 80 years after Ramesses III's reign under Ramesses XI, the last king of Egypt's New Kingdom.|$|R
25|$|However, {{there was}} little {{pressure}} they could bring {{to bear on the}} people who <b>could</b> <b>ultimately</b> make changes, longtime team owners Wellington Mara and his nephew Tim, who inherited his father Jack's stake in the team after Jack Mara died in 1965. The two managed team operations closely, but feuded so bitterly with each other that at one point a partition had to be erected between their seats in the owners' box. The effects of this uncertainty and instability at the highest managerial level affected the team's play, most significantly when it came to some apparently inexplicable personnel decisions. It was not lost on fans that players (Craig Morton and Fran Tarkenton) and coaches (Tom Landry and Vince Lombardi) who had once been in the Giants' fold were now enjoying or had enjoyed great success elsewhere. The team also had passed over future stars for less able players in the annual draft.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{because of}} its reputation, the demand for places in the school has outstripped capacity, and entry was selective. The school was zoned {{at least since the}} 1960s. Since 2000, school zoning is {{determined}} by a state school enrolment scheme, which gives first preference to students living in a designated home zone, and then to brothers of current students who live outside the zone. The school argues that zoning increases house prices in the zone, reducing access to the school for students from lower socio-economic groups. Research by the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand shows there is a 30 percent premium ($257,000) on houses in-zone compared to those out of zone. In 2014, nearby One Tree Hill College and Selwyn College introduced enrolment schemes which initially planned to overlap parts of the Auckland Grammar zone. Both were forced to backtrack after opposition from parents in the overlapping areas, who feared it <b>could</b> <b>ultimately</b> lead to Auckland Grammar shrinking its zone and affecting the resale value of their homes.|$|E
500|$|Later on October 14, {{the system}} became much better defined, with {{increasingly}} organized shower and thunderstorm activity, as {{conditions in the}} upper levels of the atmosphere became significantly more favorable. It was then that the National Hurricane Center first indicated {{that it was possible}} for a tropical depression to develop in the area. Dvorak classifications were initiated on October 15. The system continued to organize, with the National Hurricane Center remarking the system <b>could</b> <b>ultimately</b> become a hurricane. By late on October 15, the surface circulation became defined well enough, with sufficiently organized deep convection, for the National Hurricane Center to designate the system as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four while it was located about [...] east-southeast of Grand Cayman.|$|E
