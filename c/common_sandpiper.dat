40|$|The main morphometric {{parameters}} describing {{the population of}} the <b>Common</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> Actitis hypoleucos were analyzed. The birds were captured in bringing forth nestlings in June - mid July, 1990 – 2007. The population of birds of the East coast of Ladoga does not differ from European ones according to its external parameters. Average wing length (N = 178) is 112. 8 ± 0. 22 (104 – 120) mm, tail (172) – 57. 3 ± 0. 22 (49 – 65 mm), tarso-metatarsus (119) – 24. 9 ± 0. 12 (21 – 29) mm, bill (159) – 28. 2 ± 0. 11 (24 – 32) mm. Yearling birds nestling {{for the first time on}} an average less than older individuals (wing length – 111. 9 ± 0. 47 mm and 113. 3 ± 0. 37 mm, respectively), the wings and tails length of senior birds can vary from year to year without any certain tendency. It is established that the wing length is reduced significantly by the end of a breeding season because of the gradual destruction of a plumage. The sizes of females and males overlap almost entirely. It is shown that the birds do not focus on size when forming pairs: the first partner of bird may be either smaller or larger. The effectiveness of sex determination of breeding <b>Common</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> with the help of morphometric indices calculated on the basis of transient birds’ measurements, needs verification as while calculating, the presence of mixed-aged individuals in samples is not considered as well as varying degrees of plumage destruction of females and males migrating in different time periods...|$|R
50|$|On the {{doorstep}} of the Peak District, the reservoir (as well as the surrounding woodland) is owned by United Utilities and supplies the town of Macclesfield with drinking water. Although a working environment, the area is a haven for wildlife. Perhaps {{best known for its}} heronry (thought to be the largest in the Peak District, with over 20 breeding pairs), the reserve is also home to ravens and birds of prey. Red deer are shy residents of the forest but can often be seen drinking from the reservoir in early morning. Changing water levels occasionally expose the reservoir banks, which become a popular feeding ground for small wading birds, including <b>common</b> <b>sandpipers,</b> green sandpipers and little ringed plovers. Flocks of crossbills are regularly seen feeding in the treetops, and winter visitors include goldeneyes and goosanders.|$|R

2500|$|Among {{crustacean}} prey, large mud crabs of {{the genus}} Scylla are frequently consumed, especially in mangrove habitats. Ground-living birds, such as the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) and different kinds of water birds, especially the magpie goose (Anseranas semipalmata), are the most commonly preyed upon birds, due to the increased chance of encounter. Even swift-flying birds and bats may be snatched if {{close to the surface}} of water, as well as wading birds while these are patrolling the shore looking for food, even down {{to the size of a}} <b>common</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (Actitis hypoleucos). Mammalian prey of juveniles and subadults are usually as large as the smaller species of ungulates, such as the greater mouse-deer (Tragulus napu) and hog deer (Hyelaphus porcinus). Various mammalian species including monkeys (i.e. crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis), long-tailed macaques (M. fascicularis) & proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus),), gibbons, wallabies, mongoose, civets, jackals (Canis ssp.), turtles, flying foxes (Pteropus ssp.), hares (Lepus ssp.), rodents, badgers, otters, fishing cats (Prionailurus viverrinus) and chevrotains are readily taken when encountered. A rare incidence of an adult, 2.6 m Saltwater Crocodile preying on an Indian Porcupine (Hystrix indica) was reported from Sri Lanka. [...] Unlike fish, crabs and aquatic creatures, mammals and birds are usually found only sporadically in or next to water so crocodiles seem to search for places where such prey may be concentrated, i.e. the water under a tree holding a flying fox colony or spots where herds of water buffaloes feed, in order to capture small animals disturbed by the buffalo or (if a large adult crocodile is hunting) weaker members of the buffalo herd.|$|E

6000|$|I confess that, when I {{think of}} it, I am {{astonished}} myself {{at such an}} experience, and to some it must seem almost incredible. It will be said, perhaps, that in the infinite variety of bird-sounds heard anywhere there must be innumerable notes which closely resemble, or are similar to, those of other species in other lands, and, although heard in a different order, the old images of cries and calls and songs are thus indirectly refreshed and kept alive. I {{do not think that}} has been any real help to me. Thus, I think of some species which has not been thought of for years, and its language comes back at call to my mind. I listen mentally to its various notes, and there is not one in the least like the notes of any British species. These images have therefore never received refreshment. Again, where there is a resemblance, as in the trisyllabic cry of the <b>common</b> <b>sandpiper</b> and another species, I listen mentally to one, then to the other, heard so long ago, and hear both distinctly, and comparing the two, find a considerable difference, one being a thinner, shriller, and less musical sound than the other. Still again, {{in the case of the}} blackbird, which has a considerable variety in its language, there is one little chirp familiar to every one--a small round drop of sound of a musical, bell-like character. Now it happens that one of the true thrushes of South America, a bird resembling our song-thrush, has an almost identical bell-like chirp, and so far as that small drop of sound is concerned the old image may be refreshed by new sense-impressions. Or I might even say that the original image has been covered by the later one, as in the case of the laughter-like cries of the Dominican and the black-backed gulls. But with regard to the thrushes, excepting that small drop of sound, the language of the two species is utterly different. Each has a melody perfect of its kind: the song of the foreign bird is not fluty nor mellow nor placid like that of the blackbird, but has in a high degree that quality of plaintiveness and gladness commingled which we admire in some fresh and very beautiful human voices, like that described in Lowell's lines [...] "To Perdita Singing":-- ...|$|E
