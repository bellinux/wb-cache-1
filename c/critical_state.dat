40|$|Our {{previous}} {{work on the}} temporal development of the genome-expression profile in single-cell early mouse embryo indicated that reprogramming occurs via a <b>critical</b> transition <b>state,</b> where the critical-regulation pattern of the zygote state disappears. In this report, we unveil the detailed mechanism of how the dynamic interaction of thermodynamic <b>states</b> (<b>critical</b> <b>states)</b> enables the genome system {{to pass through the}} <b>critical</b> transition <b>state</b> to achieve genome reprogramming right after the late 2 -cell state. Self-organized criticality (SOC) control of overall expression provides a snapshot of self-organization and explains the coexistence of <b>critical</b> <b>states</b> at a certain experimental time point. The time-development of self-organization is dynamically modulated by changes in expression flux between <b>critical</b> <b>states</b> through the cell nucleus milieu, where sequential global perturbations involving activation-inhibition of multiple <b>critical</b> <b>states</b> occur from the middle 2 -cell to the 4 -cell state. Two cyclic fluxes act as feedback flow and generate critical-state coherent oscillatory dynamics. Dynamic perturbation of these cyclic flows due to vivid activation of the ensemble of low-variance expression (sub-critical state) genes allows the genome system to overcome a transition state during reprogramming. Our findings imply that a universal mechanism of long-term global RNA oscillation underlies autonomous SOC control, and the critical gene ensemble at a critical point (CP) drives genome reprogramming. Identification of the corresponding molecular players will be essential for understanding single-cell reprogramming...|$|R

25|$|Shear {{strength}} {{is a term}} used in soil mechanics to describe {{the magnitude of the}} shear stress that a soil can sustain. The shear resistance of soil is a result of friction and interlocking of particles, and possibly cementation or bonding at particle contacts. Due to interlocking, particulate material may expand or contract in volume as it is subject to shear strains. If soil expands its volume, the density of particles will decrease and the strength will decrease; in this case, the peak strength would be followed by a reduction of shear stress. The stress-strain relationship levels off when the material stops expanding or contracting, and when interparticle bonds are broken. The theoretical state at which the shear stress and density remain constant while the shear strain increases may be called the <b>critical</b> <b>state,</b> steady state, or residual strength.|$|E

40|$|We derive a {{holographic}} dual for a gauged matrix {{model in}} general dimensions from a first-principle construction. The dual theory {{is shown to}} be a closed string field theory which includes a compact two-form gauge field coupled with closed strings in one higher dimensional space. Possible phases of the matrix model are discussed in the holographic description. Besides the confinement phase and the IR free deconfinement phase, there can be two different classes of <b>critical</b> <b>states.</b> The first class describes `holographic critical states' where strings are deconfined in the bulk. The second class describes `non-holographic critical states' where strings are confined due to proliferation of topological defects for the two-form gauge field. This implies that the <b>critical</b> <b>states</b> of the matrix model which admit holographic descriptions with deconfined string in the bulk form novel universality classes with non-trivial quantum orders which make the holographic <b>critical</b> <b>states</b> qualitatively distinct from the non-holographic <b>critical</b> <b>states.</b> The signatures of the non-trivial quantum orders in the holographic states are discussed.

It is also established that this system is statically and dynamically stable for the entire region of variation of the non-conservativeness load parameter, contrary to existing analyses. Moreover, it is deduced that the <b>critical</b> <b>states</b> corresponding to both types of instability may become unstable if a slight material non-linearity is included; then, the mechanism of divergence and flutter instability change from stable to unstable and vice versa for a critical value of the material non-linearity which depends on the non-conservativeness loading parameter. © 1992...|$|R
