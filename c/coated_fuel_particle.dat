Exposed heavy metal (HM) contamination levels must be reduced to {le} 1 E- 5 fraction. Particle coating breakage during the fuel compact fabrication process {{has been shown to}} be a major source of HM contamination in the final fuel compacts. Excessive forces are experienced by the coated fuel particles during matrix injection, which leads to coating failure. Adding a sacrificial, low Young`s modulus, overcoating of low density PyC in a fluidized particle bed, was shown to greatly increase the crush strength of TRISO coated fuel particles in 1986 studies (Ref. 2).

The small margin of safety between product quality and the specification limit dictated that additional process development of the TRISO-P particle design must be conducted.

Other irradiations indicated the successful development of a <b>coated</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>particle</b> which permits fabrication of fuel elements meeting the PBR design objectives of a fission-product release rate (R/B) ? /sup 10 - 6 /. beta plus gamma system activity in a 125 Mw(e) PBR is 490 c, assuming complete release of /sup lO- 6 / of all fission products volatile at or below 2500 deg F. The low R/B being obtained from PBR fuel elements indicates that decay during diffusion of the short-lived volatile precursors of nonvolatile daughter products will result in further reduction of this system activity, and an increase in the average half life of the fission products remaining in the system will increase the efficiency of a bypass clean-up system. The method of fabricating coated particles by the hydrolysis of metallic chlorides to produce oxides or pyrolysis of hydrocarbons to produce carbon on a suitable substrate, is described, and preirradiation test results are given. An accelerated coated-fuel-particle program is discussed as well as development work on the Pebble Bed REactor concept as a whole. aut...|$|E

As one part of this fuel {{development}} program a series of eight (8) fuel irradiation tests are planned for the Idaho National Laboratory’s (INL’s) Advanced Test Reactor (ATR).

40|$|High-temperature {{reactors}} {{make use}} of tri-structural coated fuel particles as basic fuel components. These TRISO particles consist of fissionable uranium dioxide fuel kernels, about 0. 5 mm in diameter, with each kernel individually encased in four distinct coating layers, starting with a porous carbon buffer, then an inner pyrolytic carbon (IPyC) layer, followed by a layer of ceramic silicon carbide (SiC) and finally an outer pyrolytic carbon layer (OPyC). Collectively, the coating layers provide the primary barrier that prevents release of fission products generated during burn up in the UO 2 fuel kernel. It is crucial {{to understand how the}} fission products contained within the fuel interact with the coating layers and how they are distributed within the fuel. The first step commonly performed to obtain the information on distribution is removal of the coating layers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the possible use of wet chemical etching techniques with the aim of removing the coating layers of ZrO 2 coated fuel particles in a controlled way and to establish experimental parameters for controlled dissolution of irradiated fuel particles. Stepwise dissolution of <b>coated</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>particle</b> coating layers, containing zirconia kernels has been investigated by chemical etching experiments with acidic solutions of different mixtures. The heating methods used include heating by conventional methods, hot plates and a muffle furnace, a reflux-heating system and microwave-assisted digestion. The etching mixtures were prepared from a number of oxidizing acids and other dehydrating agents. The capability of each reagent to etch the layer completely and in a controlled manner was examined. On etching the first layer, the OPyC, the reflux heating method gave the best results in removing the layer, its advantage being that the reaction can be carried out at temperatures of about 130 ºC for a long time without the loss of the acid. The experimental results demonstrated that a mixture composed of equal amounts of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acid mixed with chromium trioxide dissolves the OPyC layer completely. The most favourable experimental conditions for removal of OPyC from a single <b>coated</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>particle</b> were identified and found to depend on the etching solution composition and etching temperature. Light microscopy yielded first-hand information on the surface features of the samples. It allowed fast comparison of etched and untreated sample features. The outer surface of particles prior to chemical etching of the outer pyrolytic carbon layer appeared black in colour with an even surface compared to the etched surfaces which appeared to have an uneven metallic grey, shiny texture. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) examination of the chemically treated outer carbon layer samples gave information on the microstructure and it demonstrated that the outer pyrolytic carbon layer could be readily removed using a solution of HNO 3 /H 2 SO 4 /CrO 3, leaving the exposed SiC layer. Complete removal of the layer was confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) analysis of the particle surface. For etching the second layer, the silicon carbide layer, microwave-assisted chemical etching was the only heating technique found to be useful. However, experimental results demonstrated that this method has limited ability to digest the sample completely. Also common chemical etchants were found to be ineffective for dissolving this layer. Only fluoride containing substances showed the potential to etch the layer. The results show that a mixture consisting of equal amounts of concentrated hydrofluoric and nitric acid under microwave heating at 200 ºC yielded partial removal of the coating and localized attack of the underlying coating layers. The SEM analyses at different intervals of etching showed: partial removal of the layer, attack of the underlying layers and, in some instances, that attack started at grain boundaries and progressed to the intra-granular features. The SEM results provide evidence that etching of the silicon carbide layer is strongly influenced by its microstructure. From these findings, it is concluded that etching of the silicon carbide under the investigated experimental conditions yields undesirable results and that it does not provide complete removal of the layer. This method has the potential to etch the layer to some extent but has limitations. CopyrightDissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013. Chemical Engineeringunrestricte...|$|E
40|$|Gas-cooled {{nuclear reactor}} is a Generation IV reactor {{which has been}} {{receiving}} significant attention due to many desired characteristics such as inherent safety, modularity, relatively low cost, short construction period, and easy financing. High temperature reactor (HTR) pebble-bed as one of type of gas-cooled reactor concept is getting attention. In HTR pebble-bed design, radius and enrichment of the fuel kernel are the key parameter that can be chosen freely to determine the desired value of criticality. This paper models HTR pebble-bed 10 MW and determines an effective of enrichment and radius of the fuel (Kernel) to get criticality value of reactor. The TRISO particle <b>coated</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>particle</b> which was modelled explicitly and distributed in the fuelled region of the fuel pebbles using a Simple-Cubic (SC) lattice. The pebble-bed balls and moderator balls distributed in the core zone using a Body-Centred Cubic lattice with assumption of a fresh fuel by the fuel enrichment was 7 - 17 % at 1 % range {{and the size of}} the fuel radius was 175 - 300 µ m at 25 µ m ranges. The geometrical model of the full reactor is obtained by using lattice and universe facilities provided by MCNP 4 C. The details of model are discussed with necessary simplifications. Criticality calculations were conducted by Monte Carlo transport code MCNP 4 C and continuous energy nuclear data library ENDF/B-VI. From calculation results can be concluded that an effective of enrichment and radius of fuel (Kernel) to achieve a critical condition was the enrichment of 15 - 17 % at a radius of 200 µ m, the enrichment of 13 - 17 % at a radius of 225 µ m, the enrichments of 12 - 15 % at radius of 250 µ m, the enrichments of 11 - 14 % at a radius of 275 µ m and the enrichment of 10 - 13 % at a radius of 300 µ m, so that the effective of enrichments and radii of fuel (Kernel) can be considered in the HTR 10 MW.

40|$|The Very High Temperature gas-cooled Reactor (VHTR), {{which is}} {{currently}} being developed, achieves simplification of safety through reliance on ceramic-coated fuel particles. Each TRISO-coated fuel particle has its own containment which serves as the principal barrier against radionuclide release under normal operating and accident conditions. These fuel particles, {{in the form of}} graphite fuel compacts, are currently undergoing a series of irradiation tests in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to support the Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor (AGR) fuel qualification program. A representive <b>coated</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>particle</b> with an 235 U enrichment of 19. 8 wt% was used in this analysis. The fuel burnup analysis tool used to perform the neutronics study reported herein, couples the Monte Carlo transport code MCNP, with the radioactive decay and burnup code ORIGEN 2. The fuel burnup methodology known as Monte-Carlo with ORIGEN 2 (MCWO) was used to evaluate the AGR experiment assembly and demonstrate compliance with ATR safety requirements. For the AGR graphite fuel compacts, the MCWO-calculated fission power density (FPD) due to neutron fission in 235 U is an important design parameter. One of the more important AGR fuel testing requirements is to maintain the peak fuel compact temperature close to 1250 °C throughout the proposed irradiation campaign of 550 effective full power days (EFPDs). Based on the MCWO-calculated FPD, a fixed gas gap size was designed to allow regulation of the fuel compact temperatures throughout the entire fuel irradiation campaign by filling the gap with a mixture of helium and neon gases. The chosen fixed gas gap can only regulate the peak fuel compact temperature in the desired range during the irradiation test if the ratio of the peak power density to the time-dependent low power density (P/T) at 550 EFPDs is less than 2. 5. However, given the near constant neutron flux within the ATR driver core and the depletion of 235 U in the graphite fuel compacts versus EFPD, the P/T ratio was calculated to be 5. 3, which is unacceptable given the fuel compact temperature control requirement. To flatten the FPD profile versus EFPDs, two proposed options are – (a) add fertile (232 Th) particles to the fuel compact and (b) add burnable absorber (B 4 C) to the graphite holder. The effectiveness of these two proposed options to flatten the FPD profile versus EFPDs were investigated and the results are compared in this study...|$|E
40|$|Ion {{implantation}} and diffusion couple {{experiments were}} used to study silver transport through and release from CVD silicon carbide. Results of these experiments show that silver does not migrate via classical diffusion in silicon carbide. Silver release is, however, likely dominated by vapor transport through cracks in SiC coatings. The results of silver ion implantation in silicon carbide and subsequent annealing at 1500 Ê»C place an upper limit on the silver diffusion coefficient in SiC of 5 x 10 - 21 m 2 /s, a value which is roughly 6 orders of magnitude less than the previous values reported in the literature. Silver diffusion should have been easily observable, but was not detected in SiC plates after heat treatments at 1500 Ê»C for times ranging between 200 h and 500 h. A detailed investigation of the silver morphology within the SiC {{both before and after}} heating showed that silver was immobilized at SiC grain boundaries and did not diffuse along them as expected. Novel spherical diffusion couples were fabricated containing silver inside shells of either graphite or SiC which were coated with CVD SiC. Mass measurements clearly revealed silver release from the diffusion couples after heating, but no silver was detected during concentration profile measurements in the SiC. Leak testing results, however, gave evidence of the presence of cracks in many of the SiC coatings, which may have provided pathways for silver escape. A simple vapor flow model was applied to estimate crack sizes that would account for silver release from SiC coatings in the current diffusion couples and <b>coated</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>particle</b> tests from the literature. (cont.) These calculated crack sizes are small enough that they would not have been detected during normal investigation or post-irradiation examination. A diffusive mechanism has been assumed to control silver transport in silicon carbide based on silver release observations reported previously in the literature, but no direct evidence of silver diffusion has been offered. Additionally, variations in silver release from particle to particle indicate that silver transport does not occur equally in all silicon carbide samples and is not consistent with diffusion. The findings presented in this dissertation are important to coated particle fuel design and fabrication because they indicate that SiC can successfully retain silver but that some SiC coatings permit silver release. Future work must be directed at identifying the pathways for silver release and their root causes in order to prevent silver release from coated fuel particles. by Heather J. MacLean. Thesis (Ph. D.)

An optimal method of designing the two parameters to decrease the size of the blind zone is proposed so as to satisfy the testing requirements. Finally, the optimal method is verified by computer simulation and some practical identification results are presented. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{to adapt}} the Hydrolysis Process for the {{fabrication}} of carbide containing uranium oxide kernels for advanced <b>coated</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>particles</b> are described. From five different carbon black varieties the best suitable carbon black is selected and a method developed to get a homogeneous dispersion of the carbon black in a surfactant-free solution with C/U atomic ratios between 0, 38 and 1, 5. The process steps degassing, reduction, presintering and carbothermic reduction of the spherical particles are investgated in detail for a reproducible fabrication of carbide containing uranium oxide kernels. Methods are developed for a continuous control of the carbothermic reduction by measuring the CO release rate, for the graphical determination of the oxygen content in the carbide phase from measured C/U and O/U ratios and for determing the amount of carbide phase in the kernels by quantitative X-ray analysis. To explain the observed characteristics spherically symmetric carbide phase distribution in the kernels a possible mechanism is proposed. Finally, the fuel kernels are compared with kernels which were subjected to the same heat treatment program but prepared by other wet chemical fabrication processes...|$|R
40|$|For {{increasing}} {{the retention of}} solid fission products in <b>coated</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>particles,</b> investigations are made on oxide fuel kernels containing special refractory oxides, e. g. Al$_{ 2 }$O$_{ 3 }$. It is {{the aim of this}} work to test the possibility of retaining solid fission products in the kernel by formation of stable ternary oxides. Using the Hydrolysis Process, U 0 $_{ 2 }$ and (U,Th) O$_{ 2 }$ kernels are prepared which contain the solid fission products Sr, Ba, Ce in concentrations corresponding to a burnup of about 10 % fima. After an out-of-pile heat treatment of these kernels of the fission product release is measured. The Sr release at 1250 °C is found tobe smaller by a factor 20 to 100 if the kernels contain Al$_{ 2 }$O$_{ 3 }$ in amounts of 1 to 5 weight percent. The solid fission products are enriched in the inclusions of Al$_{ 2 }$O$_{ 3 }$ which is not soluble in the UO$_{ 2 }$ matrix of the kernel...|$|R
40|$|The {{safety and}} {{performance}} of the fuel of the High Temperature Reactor (HTR) is largely controlled by the anisotropy of the pyrolytic carbon (PyC) coatings in the tristructural isotropic (TRISO) <b>coated</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>particles</b> and the graphite matrix of its fuel compacts. The optical anisotropy factor (OPTAF) and diattenuation of several pyrolytic carbon (PyC) coatings were characterised by two modulator generalised ellipsometry microscopy (2 -MGEM). These results were compared to the texture values obtained from {{selected area electron diffraction}} patterns by transmission electron microscopy. The differences between "nano-, micro- and macro"-anisotropy are discussed. We established that previously observed sudden increase of PyC coating failure under neutron irradiation at OPTAF values above 1. 04 originates from the development of a microstructure with polyhedral growth features and graphene planes with a single preferred orientation. Three graphite fuel compacts (two cylindrical and one pebble) were also characterised. We have identified that the use of an overcoating on the TRISO particles can result in the formation of a macro-anisotropic area. JRC. E. 4 -Nuclear fuel...|$|R

The testing will be irradiated in an inert gas atmosphere without on-line temperature monitoring and control combined with on-line fission product monitoring of the sweep gas. The irradiation device contains two test rods, one has nine fuel compacts and the other five compacts and eight graphite specimens. Each compact contains about 260 TRISO-coated particles. The irradiation device is being loaded and irradiated into the OR 5 hole of the in HANARO core from August 2013. The device will be operated for about 150 effective full-power days at a peak temperature of about 1030 °C in BOC (Beginning of Cycle) during irradiation testing.

40|$|With {{a view to}} {{understanding}} the diffusion of radionuclides through the silicon carbide layers in Tristructural Isotropic (TRISO) <b>coated</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>particles,</b> density functional theory (DFT) calculations are applied to palladium, silver, tin and caesium with silicon carbide. The silicon carbide molecule (Si 2 C 2), crystalline cubic silicon carbide (β-SiC) and the (120) Σ 5 grain boundary of β-SiC are investigated to elucidate {{the differences in the}} interactions of silicon carbide with these elements. The calculations show that the electronic interactions {{have a significant effect on}} the way these elements interact with the silicon and carbon atoms of silicon carbide. The lowest energy structure of the AgSi 2 C 2 complex is unique to silver, although for all these elements low energy structures are formed where the metal atom lies to one side of a C-Si bond. By comparing the incorporation energies in the solid phases, it is possible to group these elements by similarities in the patterns of incorporation energies. Silver and palladium form a group with carbon, tin is grouped with silicon and caesium is on its own. JRC. E. 3 -Materials researc...|$|R
40|$|The Generation IV Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GFR) {{concept is}} {{proposed}} {{to combine the}} advantages of high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (such as efficient direct conversion with a gas turbine {{and the potential for}} application of high-temperature process heat), with the sustainability advantages that are possible with a fast-spectrum reactor. The latter include the ability to fission all transuranics and the potential for breeding. The GFR is part of a consistent set of gas-cooled reactors that includes a medium-term Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) -like concept, or concepts based on the Gas Turbine Modular Helium Reactor (GT-MHR), and specialized concepts such as the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR), as well as actinide burning concepts []. To achieve the necessary high power density and the ability to retain fission gas at high temperature, the primary fuel concept proposed for testing in the United States is a dispersion <b>coated</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>particles</b> in a ceramic matrix.

40|$|Silicon carbide (SiC) and {{pyrolytic carbon}} (PyC) {{coatings}} in tristructural isotropic (TRISO) <b>coated</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>particles</b> were characterised {{by a combination}} of 2 -modulator generalised ellipsometry microscopy (2 -MGEM), Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. We compared the values of anisotropy obtained from 2 -MGEM and Raman spectroscopy to investigate the effect of sampling area and microstructure. No linear correlation in anisotropy was found between these two techniques despite both sampling areas of 2 - 5 µm. The largest deviations were observed for highly anisotropic samples with optical anisotropy factors (OPTAF) above 1. 1. For medium and low anisotropy samples (OPTAF < 1. 1) the relationship is close to linear. The limited use of only the average value of diattenuation does not give an accurate representation of the characteristics of the coatings as significant areas can exist with considerably higher diattenuations that could increase the probability of failure under neutron irradiation. We also observe a change in the diattenuation of SiC due to the presence of α-SiC as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy was also used to perform semiquantitaive analysis of the Si and carbon excess in SiC in four TRISO particles. JRC. E. 4 -Nuclear fuel...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of <b>coated</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>particles</b> {{is essential for}} the development and deployment of High Temperature Gas Reactor (HTGR) systems for future power generation. Fuel performance modeling is indispensable for understanding the physical behavior of <b>fuel</b> <b>particles</b> and achieving their high reliability during operations and accidents through a guided design process. This thesis develops an integrated fuel performance model of <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> <b>fuel</b> to comprehensively study its mechanical behavior and define an optimum fuel design strategy with the aid of the model. Key contributions of the thesis include a pyrocarbon layer crack induced particle failure model with a fracture mechanics approach, mechanical analysis of particles with better representation of irradiation induced creep, a proposed fuel optimization procedure, the capability to simulate arbitrary irradiation histories, and the incorporation of Monte Carlo sampling to account for the statistical variation of particle properties. (cont.) Stress calculations in this model were benchmarked with the FUEL code and finite element calculations of Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) and with model predictions for High Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR) first- loading fuel. Fuel failure predictions were made for New Production-Modular HTGR irradiated fuel capsules, which show good agreements with experiments. Based on the simulations, it is suggested that in most cases the pyrocarbon crack induced fuel failure mechanism plays a much more important role in fuel performance than the more widely accepted pressure vessel fuel failure mechanism. After the establishment of the model, parametric study was conducted to find out the effects of various input variables on fuel performance, and fuel design and optimization procedure was proposed accordingly. Simulations with optimized fuel configurations demonstrate that superior fuel performance can be achieved with model analysis. The model also prepares interfaces for further improvements on various modules upon arrival of new information. by Jin Wang. Thesis (Ph. D.)
