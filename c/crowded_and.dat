5|$|The {{bright green}} {{cotyledon}} {{leaves of the}} seedlings are oblong to linear in shape and measure 1.5cm (0.6in) long by 0.3cm (0.1in) wide. The greenish red hypocotyl is hairy, as are the stems of young plants. The hairy seedling leaves are <b>crowded</b> <b>and</b> oppositely arranged. They measure 0.7–1.3cm (0.2–0.5in) in length and have recurved margins. Young plants often begin branching within {{their first year of}} life.|$|E
5|$|The main {{criticisms of}} the film were that its {{characters}} were underdeveloped, its script was <b>crowded,</b> <b>and</b> it was overlong. However, the special effects, chemistry between Stone and Garfield, Dane DeHaan's performance, the action scenes, and Hans Zimmer's musical score were met with high praise. Foxx's portrayal of Max Dillon/Electro was met with mixed reviews.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} {{the psychology of the}} <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> its impact on the individual. The main aim of this work is to understand the general characteristics of the <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> to apply this knowledge to the shopping <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> determine the factors that influence an individual in the shopping crowd the most. The thesis is divided into theoretical and practical part. The theoretical part illustrates the characteristics of collective behavior <b>and</b> of the <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> the factors influencing the crowd in general terms {{and in terms of the}} shopping crowd. The practical part is focused on the shopping <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> is composed of two parts. The first part contains a survey dealing with the mob behavior when purchasing, and its evaluation. The questionnaire of both genders and all age groups was used as a main part of survey. The second part based on outcomes of the theoretical part, survey and data from the media sets the factors influencing the behavior of the shopping crowd. The analysis concludes with a comprehensive evaluation of the thesis...|$|R

5|$|The {{remaining}} men aged 16 – 60 {{were immediately}} {{incorporated into the}} Volkssturm. However, some Volkssturm members, without basic military knowledge and training, escaped into the woods, hoping to simply survive. Refugee trains leaving East Prussia were also extremely <b>crowded,</b> <b>and</b> due to the very low temperatures, children often froze to death during the journey. The last refugee train left Königsberg on January 22, 1945.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{colliery}} site had become <b>crowded,</b> <b>and</b> included a brickworks that used fireclay and shale spoil from the pit. It was surrounded by housing and factories in what {{was one of the most}} industrial parts of Manchester. The ready supply of coal encouraged the development of Manchester's chemical industry around the colliery and in the northeast of the city generally. A factory producing carbolic acid from coal tar was established in 1857, and sulphuric acid and naphthalene were produced from 1865 in nearby Blackley, later the site of ICI's Dyestuff's Division.|$|E
5|$|Following the RPF victory, {{approximately}} two million Hutu fled to {{refugee camps in}} neighbouring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan genocide. The camps were <b>crowded</b> <b>and</b> squalid, and thousands of refugees died in disease epidemics, including cholera and dysentery. The camps were {{set up by the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide, who began rearming in a bid to return to power in Rwanda.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a configurable simulation tool that can simulate <b>crowd</b> movement <b>and</b> behaviour in real time. The tool has three main features: (1) demonstrate {{the impact of}} altering building layout (e. g. size of gates, positions of corridors); (2) highlight the effects on <b>crowd</b> behaviour <b>and</b> movement by varying the crowd composition; (3) demonstrate the influence of different external factors (e. g. signs, guide people) on crowd behaviour. The simulation results {{can be used to}} help improve building layout design or optimise navigation plans. This tool takes the multi-agent system approach to build a crowd model. Each agent re{{presents a}}n intelligent individual in the <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> has a unique set of parameters to distinguish it from others. Agent conducts its behaviour by combining basic steering behaviours. Steering behaviours contain steering forces that are calculated by considering surroundings (including <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> environment objects) as well as individual parameters. All of parameters and steering behaviours are configurable in order to fine-tune the <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> environment to fit various scenarios. Crowd are formed through interaction and collaboration between agents <b>and</b> environment. <b>Crowd</b> movement <b>and</b> behaviour can be observed from the real time simulator. By altering building structure layout, composition of <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> navigation plans, <b>crowd</b> movement <b>and</b> behaviour will change accordingly. Such observations and results will provide useful feedbacks to designers and planners...|$|R

5|$|The Van Cortlandt Golf Course, {{which opened}} on July 6, 1895, with nine holes, is located {{centrally}} {{on the park}} grounds. Within a year, the course became very <b>crowded</b> <b>and</b> disorganized, with crowds behaving poorly. Rules were set in 1896, with golfers paying caddies 15 cents per round or 25 cents per two rounds. Only caddies with badges could be hired, and bicycles, baby strollers, horse-riding, and horse-drawn carriages were banned from the course.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{has been}} called a masterpiece depiction of a battle scene, and much more than a simple depiction of a bloody battle. It is a complex picture, requiring more than a cursory look; a French critic, viewing it in Paris in 1879, declared that it was a museum in its own right, requiring eight days of study before one could properly appreciate it. At the same time, critics have pointed to the unrealistic depiction of the battle, and some anachronistic accessories present in the painting. Others have criticized the painting for being too <b>crowded</b> <b>and</b> chaotic.|$|E
5|$|The secotioid and gasteroid {{species in}} Lactarius and Russula {{are derived from}} agaricoid forms. Secotioid species still have a stipe but the cap does not open fully, while in gasteroid species, fruitbodies are {{completely}} closed and the stipe is reduced; in both cases, the spore-bearing structure {{is made up of}} convoluted gills that are more or less <b>crowded</b> <b>and</b> anastomosed. These closed-fruitbody species represent a continuum of secotioid to gasteroid, above-ground to below-ground fruitbodies, with spores forcibly discharged or not. Secotioid or gasteroid Lactarius exude latex just like their agaricoid relatives.|$|E

5|$|While Gens was {{in control}} of the ghetto, he {{continued}} to oversee the sanitary and health efforts in the ghetto, running that part of the ghetto administration like a military operation. Although conditions were very <b>crowded</b> <b>and</b> often unsanitary, the ghetto never suffered a major epidemic and there were fewer deaths due to disease than in other ghettos. A network of children's homes was set up in March 1942 on Gens' orders. These homes were for orphans or those with parents who could not care properly for them. A department of the ghetto administration was in charge of supervising bosses who employed {{children under the age of}} 16.|$|E
5|$|Confusion {{with the}} highly {{regarded}} miller or sweetbread mushroom (Clitopilus prunulus) {{is a common}} cause of poisoning in France; the latter fungus has a greyish-white downy cap and whitish decurrent gills which turn pink with maturity. Young fruit bodies of Entoloma sinuatum can also be confused with St George's mushroom (Calocybe gambosa), although the gills of the latter are <b>crowded</b> <b>and</b> cream in colour, and the clouded agaric (Clitocybe nebularis), which has whitish decurrent gills and an unusual odour. To complicate matters, it often grows near these edible species. Its overall size and shape resemble members of the genus Tricholoma, although the spore colour (white in Tricholoma, pinkish in Entoloma) and shape (angular in Entoloma) help distinguish it. The rare and edible all-white dovelike tricholoma (T.columbetta) has a satiny cap and stem and a faint, not mealy, odour. E.sinuatum may be confused with Clitocybe multiceps in the Pacific Northwest of North America, although the latter has white spores and generally grows in clumps. A casual observer may mistake it for an edible field mushroom (Agaricus campestris), but this species has a ring on the stipe, pink gills that become chocolate-brown in maturity, and a dark brown spore print. The poorly known North American species E. albidum resembles E.sinuatum but is likewise poisonous.|$|E
5|$|Folding@home is {{also used}} to study protein chaperones, heat shock {{proteins}} which play essential roles in cell survival by assisting with the folding of other proteins in the <b>crowded</b> <b>and</b> chemically stressful environment within a cell. Rapidly growing cancer cells rely on specific chaperones, and some chaperones play key roles in chemotherapy resistance. Inhibitions to these specific chaperones are seen as potential modes of action for efficient chemotherapy drugs or for reducing the spread of cancer. Using Folding@home and working closely with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, the Pande lab hopes to find a drug which inhibits those chaperones involved in cancerous cells. Researchers are also using Folding@home to study other molecules related to cancer, such as the enzyme Src kinase, and some forms of the engrailed homeodomain: a large protein which may be involved in many diseases, including cancer. In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the small knottin protein EETI, which can identify carcinomas in imaging scans by binding to surface receptors of cancer cells.|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{moved into}} the Führerbunker on 16 January 1945. He was joined by his senior staff, {{including}} Martin Bormann. In April 1945, Eva Braun and Joseph Goebbels {{moved into the}} Führerbunker while Magda Goebbels and their six children took residence in the upper Vorbunker. Two or three dozen support, medical, and administrative staff were also sheltered there. These included Hitler's secretaries (including Traudl Junge), a nurse named Erna Flegel, and telephone switchboard operator Sergeant Rochus Misch. Early on, Hitler continued to utilize the undamaged wing of the Reich Chancellery, where he held afternoon military conferences in his large study. Afterwards, he would have tea with his secretaries before going {{back down into the}} bunker complex for the night. After several weeks of this routine, Hitler seldom left the bunker except for short strolls in the chancellery garden with his dog Blondi. The bunker was <b>crowded</b> <b>and</b> the atmosphere was oppressive; air raids occurred daily. Hitler mostly stayed on the lower level, where it was quieter and he could sleep. Conferences took place for much of the night, often until 05:00.|$|E
5|$|The {{surge of}} air travellers, catalyzed by {{low-cost}} carriers {{and the rise}} of air-transport demands among Indonesia's rising middle class, has put intense stress on Indonesia's aging airports. Nevertheless, there has been some efforts to improve and upgrade airport facilities, such as the construction of Medan's brand-new Kuala Namu Airport to replace the overwhelmed, aging, and accident-prone Polonia Airport. Other newly built airports include Lombok Airport, replacing the old Selaparang Airport in Lombok; and Minangkabau Airport, replacing the old Tabing Airport in Padang. Existing airports that have undergone massive expansion and upgrades include Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali, Juanda Airport in Surabaya, and Sultan Hasanuddin Airport in Makassar. There are plans to build a second Bali airport in Kubu Tambahan near Singaraja, northern Bali, a new larger airport in Kulon Progo near Yogyakarta to replace the <b>crowded</b> <b>and</b> overwhelmed Adisutjipto Airport, and Kertajati Airport in Kertajati, Majalengka, to replace Bandung's Husein Sastranegara Airport and also to serve the vicinity of Cirebon. To improve transportation interconnectivity, the government plans to build railways connecting airports all over Indonesia with nearby city centers. Currently, only Kuala Namu and Adisutjipto airports have a railway connection to the city center, while airport railways are currently under construction in Soekarno–Hatta and Minangkabau airports.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the coal}} mines of Wales and {{northern}} England, the Cornish mines generally {{did not provide}} housing for their workers, largely owing to the casual nature of work under the tribute team system. Bal maidens would typically travel to the mines from their family homes, some families building homes near the mine. (Until the Inclosure Acts of the late 18th and early 19thcenturies, anyone moving to an area {{had the right to}} build a house on common land, provided they could build it overnight.) They would generally remain living with their families until marriage. (Much of early 19thcentury Cornwall retained the old custom of 'keeping company', by which a couple would not be formally married until the woman became pregnant, and the woman would continue to work and to live with her family until that time.) While some lived at or near the mine at which they worked, mine workers typically walked three to four miles (five to sevenkm) to and from work each day. The miners' cottages were generally <b>crowded</b> <b>and</b> squalid, sometimes with ten or more people living in each small cottage, while the abstraction of the region's water supplies for use in the mines led to serious problems with sanitation and the provision of fresh water.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBoth <b>crowding</b> <b>and</b> {{binocular}} rivalry impair object perception, but {{their influence on}} object perception has so far only been investigated in separate fields. Three experiments investigated the joint influences of <b>crowding</b> <b>and</b> rivalry on object perception (orientation discrimination). Experiment 1 investigated how <b>crowding</b> <b>and</b> rivalry influence orientation discrimination together. Experiment 2 tested whether rivalry between flankers affects crowding using an orientation discrimination task. Experiment 3 tested whether crowding affects the temporal dynamics of the rivalry between a target and a rival stimulus. In Experiment 1, judgments of target orientation were more impaired when <b>crowding</b> <b>and</b> rivalry were simultaneously induced than when they were separately induced and their effects were combined. In Experiment 2, judgments of target orientation were impaired even when flankers were undergoing rivalry, thus highlighting {{the importance of the}} presence of flankers. Experiment 3 showed that flankers presented in the neighborhood of a target undergoing rivalry shortened target dominance and prolonged target suppression. The augmented impairments of object perception found in Experiments 1 and 3 suggest that <b>crowding</b> <b>and</b> rivalry interact, presumably through signal suppression. The adverse effect of flankers shown in Experiment 2 suggests that inappropriate feature integration may have additionally contributed to this interaction...|$|R
