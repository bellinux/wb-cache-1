500|$|A {{species of}} {{parasitic}} phtilopterid louse, Rallicola extinctus, was only known {{to live on}} the huia, and apparently became extinct with its host. In 2008, a new species of feather mite, Coraciacarus muellermotzfeldi, was described from dried corpses found in the feathers of a huia skin held by a European museum. While the genus Coraciacarus has a wide range of hosts globally, the presence of a representative of the genus on a passerine bird was an [...] "enigmatic phenomenon". The discoverers suggested the mite could have been horizontally transferred from one of the two native, migratory species of cuckoo (<b>Cuculiformes).</b>|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, {{this group}} has been allied with the cuckoos in the order <b>Cuculiformes,</b> but the Sibley-Ahlquist {{taxonomy}} raises this group to a full order Musophagiformes. They have been proposed to link the hoatzin to the other living birds, but this was later disputed. Recent genetic analysis have strongly supported the order ranking of Musophagiformes.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] Indian cuckoo (Cuculus micropterus) is {{a member}} of the cuckoo order of birds, the <b>Cuculiformes,</b> that is found in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It ranges from India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka east to Indonesia and north to China and Russia. It is a solitary and shy bird, found in forests and open {{woodland}} at up to 3,600 m.|$|E
50|$|Of these, the {{relationship}} of the Strigiformes is uncertain, whereas the first three groups almost certainly do not belong here; sandgrouse (Pterocliformes) may not even be higher landbirds. The <b>Cuculiformes,</b> Piciformes (including toucans), Coraciiformes (including hornbills) and Trogoniformes seem to be very close to the Passeriformes on the other hand (Johansson & Ericson 2003), and one of these almost certainly is—among the living birds—the sister taxon of the Passeriformes.|$|E
5000|$|The taxonomical {{relations}} of F. panarium remain unclear. It is sometimes {{placed in a}} distinct family Foratidae. It {{may or may not}} be related to the <b>Cuculiformes</b> (including turacos) and is sometimes seen as a [...] "missing link" [...] between the cuckoos and/or turacos and the puzzling hoatzin of the Amazon. The latter might be related to any number of different modern birds however; its affinities constitute a major ornithological enigma.|$|E
5000|$|Pumiliornis tessellatus is {{an ancient}} bird from the Middle Eocene of Messel, Hesse, Germany. It is {{described}} as a wren-sized anisodactyl bird with a long, slender bill and strong hallux. Its species name tessellatus, meaning [...] "mosaic" [...] in Latin, is a reference to its unusual distribution of characters and uncertain phylogenetic placement. It has some anatomical affinities with <b>Cuculiformes,</b> but similar fossils that might be related to this taxon do not.|$|E
50|$|Zygodactyly (from Greek ζυγος, even) is an {{arrangement}} of digits in birds and chameleons, with two toes facing forward (digits 2 and 3) and two back (digits 1 and 4). This arrangement is most common in arboreal species, particularly those that climb tree trunks or clamber through foliage. Zygodactyly occurs in the parrots, woodpeckers (including flickers), cuckoos (including roadrunners), and some owls. Zygodactyl tracks have been found dating to 120-110 Ma (early Cretaceous), 50 million years before the first identified zygodactyl fossils. All Psittaciformes, <b>Cuculiformes,</b> the majority of Piciformes and the osprey are zygodactyl.|$|E
50|$|The Asian koel (Eudynamys scolopaceus) is {{a member}} of the cuckoo order of birds, the <b>Cuculiformes.</b> It is found in the Indian Subcontinent, China, and Southeast Asia. It forms a {{superspecies}} with the closely related black-billed and Pacific koels which are sometimes treated as subspecies. The Asian koel is a brood parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of crows and other hosts, who raise its young. They are unusual among the cuckoos in being largely frugivorous as adults. The name koel is echoic in origin with several language variants. The bird is a widely used symbol in Indian poetry.|$|E

5000|$|The hoatzin was {{originally}} described by German zoologist Statius Müller in 1776. There {{has been much}} debate about the hoatzin's relationships with other birds. Because of its distinctness it has been given its own family, the Opisthocomidae, and its own suborder, the Opisthocomi. At various times, it has been allied with such taxa as the tinamous, the Galliformes (gamebirds), the rails, the bustards, seriemas, sandgrouse, doves, turacos and other <b>Cuculiformes,</b> and mousebirds. A whole genome sequencing study published in 2014 places the hoatzin as the sister taxon of a clade composed of Gruiformes (cranes) and Charadriiformes (plovers).|$|E
50|$|Entire {{surface is}} pure black {{due to the}} {{presence}} of eumelanin pigmentation {{in all parts of the}} feathers with considerable extension of black pigment to the shanks and beaks. The head, hackle, back, saddle, sickles and wing bows of the may have a beetle-green to purple sheen that may be particularly rich in male birds but still very evident in females. The green and purple sheens are a structural coloration, not pigment. The feathers of chickens and nearly all birds which appear to have green feathers do not have any green pigment. Green pigment has only been found in turacos (<b>Cuculiformes,</b> Musophagidae), small African birds. Structural coloration is produced by the constructive interference of light reflecting from different layers of the structures in feathers.|$|E
50|$|The {{greater coucal}} or crow {{pheasant}} (Centropus sinensis), {{is a large}} non-parasitic member of the cuckoo order of birds, the <b>Cuculiformes.</b> A widespread resident in Asia, from India, Pakistan, east to south China, Nepal and Indonesia, it is divided into several subspecies, some being treated as full species. They are large, crow-like with a long tail and coppery brown wings and found in wide range of habitats from jungle to cultivation and urban gardens. They are weak fliers, and are often seen clambering about in vegetation or walking {{on the ground as}} they forage for insects, eggs and nestlings of other birds. They have a familiar deep resonant call which is associated with omens in many parts of its range.|$|E
50|$|In addition, the Eocene genus Hoatzi from Argentina {{has been}} allied {{to both the}} hoatzin and Foro and even been {{considered}} congeneric with the latter. What is certain is that the <b>Cuculiformes,</b> especially the turacos, are among the likelier candidates for the hoatzin's closest living relatives. There is an ancestral hoatzin, Hoazinoides, from the Early or Middle Miocene of Colombia, which would at least not contradict the assumption that Foro panarium was an ancient member of the hoatzin lineage or its predecessor. On the other hand, it has been proposed that the hoatzin belongs to a highly distinct clade of (probably) Cretaceous origin, the Metaves. As nothing certain about the evolutionary history of the hoatzin lineage throughout the Paleogene is known at all, F. panarium cannot support or contradict this hypothesis either.|$|E
50|$|Gnateaters are {{notable for}} their absence from these flocks, while swifts and {{swallows}} rarely join them, but will {{if there is}} for example an ant or termite swarm. Cotingidae (cotingas) are mainly opportunistic associates which rarely join flocks for long if they do so at all; {{the same holds true}} for most Muscicapoidea (mockingbirds and relatives), though some thrushes may participate on more often. And though most Tityridae rarely join mixed flocks, becards do so regularly. Tapaculos are rarely seen with mixed flocks, though the collared crescentchest, doubtfully assigned to that family, may be a regular member. Icteridae (grackles and relatives) are also not too often seen to take part in these assemblages, though caciques like the golden-winged or red-rumped cacique join mixed flocks on a somewhat more regular basis. <b>Cuculiformes</b> (cuckoos and allies) are usually absent from mixed feeding flocks, but some - for example, the squirrel cuckoo - can be encountered not infrequently.|$|E
50|$|On the {{territory}} of the Prioksko-Terrasny state nature biosphere reserve, covering 4945 ha, 134 species of birds from 14 orders (Ciconiiformes, Anseriformes, Falconiformes, Galliformes, Gruiformes, Charadriiformes, Columbiformes, <b>Cuculiformes,</b> Strigiformes, Caprimulgiformes, Apodiformes, Coraciiformes, Piciformes, Passeriformes) had been registered by 1991. Later 5 more species were observed here. Thus, by the present time, the list of species of birds registered in the Reserve numbers 139 species. About 55% from them are Passerines. Most of birds of the Reserve belong to migratory breeding species or to nomadic breeding species. Some species are vagrants in the Reserve and in the Moscow Region (nutcracker Nicifraga caryocatactes (L.), etc.). Birds, nesting in central parts of Russia and on {{the territory}} of the Prioksko-Terrasny Reserve, in autumn are migrating to south-west. Part of them are wintering in southern regions of Russia and near the Black Sea, others are flying to south-western part of Europe: the Balkans, the Apennines, South France, South Germany. The rest migrate across the Mediterranean Sea and fly to Northern Africa.|$|E
40|$|Têm-se notado vários estudos recentes em filogenia com os <b>Cuculiformes,</b> no entanto nestes trabalhos ainda há divergências. Apresenta-se aqui uma nova e ampla análise filogenética para os <b>Cuculiformes</b> com base em 250 caracteres da osteologia, comportamento e ecologia. Esta análise resultou em 18 cladogramas igualmente parcimoniosos (768 passos, IC = 0. 4779, IR = 0. 8080 e ICR = 0. 3861). De acordo com o cladograma de consenso estrito se pode observar: a) o monofiletismo dos Cuculiformes; b) a ordem dividida em dois grupos: a) Coua/Carpococcyx e; b) demais cucos (Neomorphidae, (Crotophagidae, (Tapera/Dromoccoccyx, (Cuculidae))), no entanto a posição sistemática de Centropus é ambígua entre estes dois grandes grupos; c) os cucos terrestres basais e parafiléticos e os cucos arbóreos derivados e monofiléticos. Ainda, propõe-se que o comportamento de parasitar ninho tenha surgido duas vezes independentemente (uma em Tapera/Dromoccoccyx e outra dentro de Cuculidae). Despite of many recent {{cladistic}} {{studies the}} classification of the order <b>Cuculiformes</b> is still controversial. Thus, we performed the most extensive cladistic analysis of the cuckoos, inferred based on 250 characters of the osteology, behavior and ecology. The resulting analysis provided 18 equally parsimonious trees (768 steps, CI = 0. 4779, RI = 0. 8080 and CRI = 0. 3861). According to the topology of the strict consensus cladogram: a) the monophyly of <b>Cuculiformes</b> order is corroborated; b) the order is divided in two groups: a) Coua/Carpococcyx and b) others cuckoos (Neomorphidae, (Crotophagidae, (Tapera/Dromoccoccyx, (Cuculidae))), being the systematic position of Centropus ambiguous between these two groups; c) the terrestrial cuckoos are considered basal and a paraphyletic group and the arboreal cuckoos are derived and monophyletic; d) brood parasitism evolved twice in the cuckoos (in Tapera/Dromoccoccyx and in Cuculidae) ...|$|E
40|$|The fossil species Parvicuculus minor was {{described}} by Harrison & Walker (1977) from the early Eocene London Clay deposits in England, and was hitherto known only from an incomplete tarsometatarsus. As indicated by its name, Parvicuculus was considered {{a member of the}} Cuculidae (cuckoos) by Harrison & Walker (1977). Cuculiform affinities of Parvicuculus were, however, disputed by Olson & Feduccia (1979), who instead assumed the taxon {{to be a member of}} the Eocene coraciiform Primobucconidae (Houde & Olson 1989, Mayr et al. 2004), in particular they considered a relationship to the alleged primobucconid ‘Neanis ’ kistneri Feduccia 1973 to be possi-ble. Harrison (1982) reevaluated the phylogenetic affinities of Parvicuculus and again considered it a member of the <b>Cuculiformes,</b> albeit not within the Cuculidae but in the new taxon Parvicuculidae. Assignment of Parvicuculus to the <b>Cuculiformes</b> was subse-quently questioned by Martin & Mengel (1984) and Baird & Vickers-Rich (1997); the taxon was placed in Aves incertae sedis by Mlíkovský (2002). Here we report on a second specimen of Parvicuculus from the early Eocene of Condé-en-Brie in France. The new specimen is an incomplete tarsometatarsus that exhibits almost the same state of preservation as the holotype of Parvicuculus minor. It is the second bird specimen described from Condé-en-Brie, in addition to a tarsometatar-sus of the Primobucconidae (Mayr et al. 2004). The age of the French locality is the same as that of Burnham-on-Crouch, the type locality of P. minor (Mammalian Paleogene 8 – 9, i. e. c. 52 million years ago; Mlíkovský 1996, Legendre & Lévêque 1997). Material and methods Osteological terminology follows Baumel & Witmer (1993), whilst measurements are in mm and represent the maximum length of the bone along its longitudinal axis. SEM photographs of sections of the French fossil were digitally composed to show the complete bone. The fossil specimens are deposited in the Muséum nation...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{intended}} to record the biodiversity status of selected village ponds in district Hisar (Haryana) from August, 2012 to July, 2013. Periodic fortnightly visits were carried out to determine the species composition and distribution pattern of birds, phytoplankton and zooplankton. A total number of 17 species of birds belonging to 9 orders (Anseriformes, Charadriiformes, Ciconiformes, Coraciifomes, <b>Cuculiformes,</b> Gruiformes, Passeriformes, Pelecaniformes and Psittaciformes) were identified in the study area. Charadriiformes was the most dominant order. The study revealed the presences of 18 species of phytoplankton belonging to Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Cyanophyceae and Euglenophyceae. Bacillariophyceae having 7 species {{was found to be}} dominant among all. In case of zooplankton, 11 species were encountered of which 7 were Rotifers, 3 were Cladocera and 1 was Copepoda.

40|$|A {{new species}} of mite from the family Analgidae, Megninia casuaricola sp. n., is {{described}} from the feathers of a southern cassowary, Casuarius casuarius (L.). Until now, cassowaries were among the few terrestrial birds thought to be without feather mites. The {{new species of}} mite is readily distinguished from other described species of Megninia Berlese {{by the lack of}} vertical setae (vi) in all stages, poorly developed tibial spurs on legs I and II, and elongate and deeply incised terminal lobes in the male. Megninia species are primarily associated with galliform birds, but are also known from Coliiformes, <b>Cuculiformes</b> and Columbiformes. Feather mites have now been collected from most living genera of ratites (Struthio L., Rhea Brisson, Apteryx Shaw, Casuarius Brisson, but not Dromaius Vieillot). Host ranges and phylogenetic affiliations of these mites do not support the common belief that ratites represent a primitive palaeognathous lineage; rather, they agree more readily with the hypothesis that ratites are descendants of relatively recent neognathous birds.

40|$|Comparative {{studies have}} yielded {{substantial}} {{insight into the}} functional relationships between the brain and behavior in birds. There are, however, important limitations to this method and problems can arise {{in the interpretation of}} the results. I use as an example, a test of whether interspecific brood parasitism is correlated with relatively smaller brains in the cuckoos and allies (<b>Cuculiformes).</b> Both conventional and phylogenetically based comparative statistics were used in conjunction with three alternative phylogenetic trees of the species examined. The comparisons between brood parasitism and relative brain size yielded mixed results, depending upon both the statistical method and the phylogeny employed. Although this could indicate that the evolution of interspecific brood parasitism is not related to relative brain size, the limitations of the comparative method in conjunction with the mixed results make it impossible to determine this with any certainty. The fact that different phylogenetic relationships yielded different results highlights the importance of phylogenetic relationships in assessing brain-behavior relationships. The continued use of phylogenetically based comparative methods should therefore be done cautiously, particularly with respect to interpretation of the results as the outcome may be as dependent upon the phylogeny as it is on the data itself...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS. Advances in {{molecular}} genetic {{techniques have}} provided new approaches for addressing evo-lutionary questions about brood parasitic birds. We review recent studies that apply genetic {{data to the}} systematics, population biology, and social systems of avian brood parasites and suggest directions for future research. Recent molecular systematics studies indicate that obligate brood parasitism has evolved indepen-dently in seven different avian lineages, a tally that has increased by one in cuckoos (<b>Cuculiformes)</b> and decreased by one in passeriforms (Passeriformes) as compared to conventional taxonomy. Genetic parentage analyses suggest that brood parasitic birds are less promiscuous than might be expected given their lack of nesting and parental care behavior. Host-specificity in brood parasites, which {{has important implications for}} host-parasite coevolution, has been evaluated using both population genetic and parentage analyses. Female lineages are faithful to particular host species over evolutionarily significant time scales in both common cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) and indigobirds (Vidua spp.), but differences in the host-specificity of male parasites has resulted in different patterns of diversification in these two lineages. Future research on brood parasitism will benefit from the availability of comprehensive molecular phylogenies for brood par-asites and their hosts and from advances in functional genomics...|$|E
