5|$|Phosphoryl {{chloride}} (commonly called phosphorus oxychloride) is a <b>colourless</b> <b>liquid</b> {{with the}} formula 3. It hydrolyses in moist air releasing phosphoric acid and choking fumes of hydrogen chloride.

5|$|Acetic acid , {{systematically}} named {{ethanoic acid}} , is a <b>colourless</b> <b>liquid</b> organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H or C2H4O2). When undiluted, {{it is sometimes}} called glacial acetic acid. Vinegar is roughly 3–9% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid {{the main component of}} vinegar apart from water. Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate. It is classified as a weak acid since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin.|$|E
5|$|Many other binary {{nitrogen}} hydrides are known, but {{the most}} important are hydrazine (N2H4) and hydrogen azide (HN3). Although it is not a nitrogen hydride, hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and hydrazine as well. Hydrazine is a fuming, <b>colourless</b> <b>liquid</b> that smells similarly to ammonia. Its physical properties are very similar to those of water (melting point 2.0°C, boiling point 113.5°C, density 1.00g·cm−3). Despite it being an endothermic compound, it is kinetically stable.

60|$|When he had {{a little}} {{recovered}} he filled the remaining glass from the bottle and drank--a <b>colourless</b> <b>liquid</b> it was, but not water, with a pleasing faint aroma and taste and a quality of immediate support and stimulus. He put down the vessel and looked about him.|$|E
6000|$|Yet was he cheerful. On his face, in mild degree, was {{depicted}} sensuous {{pleasure as}} he lethargically scratched his ribs with his one hand. He pawed over his food-scraps, debated, then drew a twelve-ounce druggist bottle from his inside coat-pocket. The bottle {{was full of}} a <b>colourless</b> <b>liquid,</b> the contemplation of which made his little eye burn brighter and quickened his movements. Picking up the tomato can, he arose, went down the short path to the river, and returned with the can filled with not-nice river water. In the condensed milk can he mixed one part of water with two parts of fluid from the bottle. This colourless fluid was druggist's alcohol, and as such is known in tramp-land as [...] "alki." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{contained}} a <b>colourless</b> <b>liquid</b> also; {{but it was}} only half the size of the first bottle, and not a drop had been taken. She waited, observing {{the difference between the two}} bottles with extraordinary attention. In this case also, the prescription was in her possession--but it was not the original. A line at the top stated that it was a copy made by the chemist, at the request of a customer. It bore the date of more than three years since. A morsel of paper was pinned to the prescription, containing some lines in a woman's handwriting:--"With your enviable health and strength, my dear, I should have thought you were the last person in the world to want a tonic. However, here is my prescription, if you must have it. Be very careful to take the right dose, because there's poison in it." [...] The prescription contained three ingredients, strychnine, quinine, and nitro-hydrochloric acid; and the dose was fifteen drops in water. Mrs. Farnaby lit a match, and burnt the lines of her friend's writing. [...] "As long ago as that," [...] she reflected, [...] "I thought of killing myself. Why didn't I do it?" ...|$|E
