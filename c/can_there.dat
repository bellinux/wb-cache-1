5|$|The soft fins, skin, and {{musculature}} of {{the false}} catshark suggest a sluggish lifestyle. An enormous oil-filled liver makes up 18–25% of its total weight, allowing it to maintain near-neutral buoyancy and hover off the bottom with little effort. This species likely captures prey via quick bursts of speed, with its large mouth allowing it to consume food of considerable size. It feeds mainly on bony fishes such as cutthroat eels, grenadiers, and snake mackerel, and also takes lanternsharks, squids, octopodes, and Heterocarpus shrimp. It likely also scavenges, as examination of stomach contents have found surface-dwelling fishes such as frigate mackerel, needlefishes, and pufferfishes. One specimen caught off the Canary Islands had swallowed human garbage, including potatoes, a pear, a plastic bag, and a soft drink <b>can.</b> <b>There</b> is a record of a false catshark found with bite marks from a great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias).|$|E

It may have been prudent, for aught I know, to impose a compliance in this matter with the insulting and reproachful demands of the first reformers; but to continue {{the practice of the}} Latin liturgy in the present state of things must be owing either to chimerical fears of innovation or to indolence and inattention in the first pastors of the national Churches in not joining to solicit or indeed ordain this necessary alteration.

25|$|A 2008 {{study by}} Earl Hunt {{published}} in the journal Intelligence found that sex differences on tests can result from recruitment factors, so that gender differences are only representative of those that actually participate in the studies. He also contested that not only <b>can</b> <b>there</b> be individual variations that studies consistently recruit, but that these studies wouldn't be representative of the general population especially if the participants only represent college students. A 2009 study by researcher Dominika Dykiert published Intelligence also found that sex differences in mean IQ scores can be partly created by male variability in cognitive abilities and sample restriction. Dykiert highlighted the need for representative samples for studying sex differences in intelligence to eliminate skewed results created by male variance and restriction of sample. Studies have also indicated that tests used to measure sex differences such as Raven's Progressive matrices is not a pure indicator of general intelligence or g factor and only shares 50% of its variance. Tests like WAIS have also been criticized as not directly measuring g factor in a 2002 study published in Intelligence. Lead researcher Roberto Colom has strongly asserted that g factor or general intelligence is the correlation among different test scores and not the summed scores on different tests, such as Raven's or WAIS. Roberto Colom has also pointed out that Raven's Progressive matrices test is biased against females because of the visuospatial nature of the test which tends to favor those with stronger visuospatial skills (i.e. males) instead of g factor. Therefore, he concluded that sex difference research should not be based on a single test but instead on multiple tests loaded with fluid intelligence.|$|E

For the next two months Broude met weekly with Halprin, educating her regarding the Friday night prayers.

He worked as a horse groomer and played semi-pro baseball, but drowned in an {{accident}} at age 37 in New York state. Doby's mother, who had divorced David before his death, moved to Paterson, New Jersey; Doby remained in Camden. He lived with his grandmother before moving {{to live with his}} father's sister and brother-in-law from 1934 to 1938. He attended Jackson School, which was segregated under South Carolina state law. His first opportunity to play organized baseball came as a student at Boylan-Haven-Mather Academy, a private school affiliated with the Methodist church. Richard Dubose, who had managed Doby's father and was known locally in African-American circles for his baseball expertise, gave Doby some of his first baseball lessons. Reflecting on his years growing up in South Carolina, including how he and playmates used worn down broom handles for bats, Doby said, [...] "Growing up in Camden, we didn't have baseball bats.

500|$|In January 1164 {{the king}} summoned a council at Clarendon. The bishops {{were asked to}} approve the Constitutions of Clarendon, which {{proposed}} restrictions on {{the powers of the}} Church and limits to papal authority in England; Becket's refusal led to the great dispute between king and archbishop, into which Foliot and his fellow bishops were inevitably drawn. When Becket appeared before the court with his archiepiscopal cross borne before him, a studied insult to the king, Foliot told the archbishop that [...] "If the king were to brandish his sword, as you now brandish yours, what hope <b>can</b> <b>there</b> be of peace between you?" [...] The king refused to see Becket, and negotiations between the two camps soon revealed that Becket had ordered the bishops to refuse to pass judgement on him and threatened them with suspension from ecclesiastical office if they did. Becket also threatened to appeal the case to the papacy. Both of these actions by the archbishop breached the Constitutions of Clarendon. During the subsequent {{back and forth between the}} bishops and the king, as well as the bishops and the archbishop, Foliot was asked by one of his fellow bishops to try and persuade Becket to modify his behaviour. Foliot replied that Becket [...] "was always a fool and always will be".|$|E
500|$|After {{the fact}} pattern, Cardozo began his {{discussion}} of the law with [...] "the conduct of the defendant's guard, if a wrong in its relation to the holder of the package, was not a wrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away. Relative to her it was not negligence at all." [...] Cardozo quoted Pollock on Torts and cited several cases for the proposition that [...] "proof of negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do." [...] Only if there is a duty to the injured plaintiff, the breach of which causes injury, <b>can</b> <b>there</b> be liability. He defended his decision, [...] "a different conclusion will involve us, and swiftly too, in a maze of contradictions." [...] Cardozo posed hypothetical situations: if a railway guard stumbles over a bundle of newspapers, and there are explosives within, will there be liability to an injured passenger {{at the other end of}} the platform? Will the result be different if the object containing the explosives is a valise instead? If there was negligence that day, Cardozo argued, it was only negligence that resulted in the fall and destruction of the package, and there was no wrong done by the railroad to Palsgraf for personal injury, [...] "the diversity of incidents emphasizes the futility of the effort to build the plaintiff's right upon the basis of a wrong to some one else." [...] The chief judge instructed, [...] "The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed". Cardozo did not absolve the defendant who knowingly unleashes a destructive force, such as by shooting a gun, just because the bullet takes an unexpected path. This is not such a case, Cardozo held: even if the railway guard had thrown down the package intentionally, without knowing the contents he could not knowingly risk harm to Palsgraf, and would not be liable. Negligence cannot impose liability where an intentional act would not.|$|E
