The trade-off between reliability and effective capacity maximization reveals that we can achieve higher reliability with limited sacrifice in effective capacity specially {{when the number of}} machines is small.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new {{reversible}} watermarking {{method is}} presented {{that reduces the}} size of a stereoscopic image sequence while keeping its content visible. The proposed technique embeds the residuals of the right frames to the corresponding frames of the left sequence, halving the total capacity. The residual frames may result in after a disparity compensated procedure between the two video streams or by a joint motion and disparity compensation. The residuals are usually lossy compressed before embedding because of the limited embedding capacity of the left frames. The watermarked frames are visible at a high quality and at any instant the stereoscopic video may be recovered by an inverse process. In fact, the left frames may be exactly recovered whereas the right ones are slightly distorted as the residuals are not embedded intact. The employed embedding method reorders the left frame into an array of consecutive pixel pairs and embeds a number of bits according to their intensity difference. In this way, it hides a number of bits in intensity smooth areas and most of the data in textured areas where resulting distortions are less visible. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed scheme is quite effective.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to show the {{influence}} of exoskeleton attachment, such as the pressure on the fixation cuffs and alignment of the robot joint to the human joint, on subjective and objective performance metrics (i. e. comfort, mental load, interface forces, tracking error and available workspace) during a typical physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) experiment. A mathematical model of a single degree of freedom interaction between humans and a wearable robot is presented and used to explain the causes and characteristics of interface forces between the two. The pHRI model parameters (real joint offsets, attachment stiffness) are estimated from experimental interface force measurements acquired during tests with 14 subjects. Insights gained by the model allow optimisation of the exoskeleton kinematics. This paper shows that offsets of more than ± 10 cm exist between human and robot axes of rotation, even if a well-designed exoskeleton is aligned properly before motion. Such offsets can create interface loads of up to 200 N and 1. 5 Nm in the absence of actuation. The optimal attachment pressure is determined to be 20 mmHg and the attachment stiffness is about 300 N/m. Inclusion of passive <b>compensation</b> <b>joints</b> in the exoskeleton is shown to lower the interaction forces significantly, which enables a more ergonomic pHRI...|$|R

The algorithm consists of two main steps. First, the noise and channel parameters are estimated using a nonlinear environment distortion model in the cepstral domain, the speech recognizer’s “feedback ” information, and the Vector-Taylor-Series (VTS) linearization technique collectively. Second, the estimated noise and channel parameters are used to adapt the static and dynamic portions of the HMM means and variances. This two-step algorithm enables <b>Joint</b> <b>compensation</b> of both Additive and Convolutive distortions (JAC). In the experimental evaluation using the standard Aurora 2 task, the proposed JAC/VTS algorithm achieves 91. 11 % accuracy using the clean-trained simple HMM backend as the baseline system for the model adaptation.
