50|$|The OT-64's engine, transmission, {{suspension}} and axles were produced in Czechoslovakia. The engine {{was produced by}} Tatra. The gearbox was manufactured by Praga Hostivař. It has a pre-select Praga-Wilson gearbox, (5 forward +1 reverse gears.) A gear is selected using the gear stick then when the gear is required the left pedal (gear change action/clutch combined) is pressed to the floor, giving a hiss of air sound, on release of the pedal the dry plate clutch engages after about half the return spring controlled movement. The drive then passes to an auxiliary gearbox with low, neutral and high ratios which needs to be selected before moving off, for road/neutral/off road use, this gives option to the driver of 10 forward and 2 reverse ratios. The gear <b>change</b> <b>pedal</b> is hydraulic and on action opens an air valve which causes the selected gear to engage. The armored hull and weapons were produced in Poland.|$|E

50|$|A {{substantial}} number of British buses built between about 1935 and 1960 had preselector transmission, particularly those built by Daimler and AEC, and some by Leyland. Some were mechanical, whereas the AEC RT type, universal in London at this period, had the gearbox air-operated (compressed air was also used for the brakes, windscreen wipers, etc.), which gave off a characteristic hiss when the <b>change</b> gear <b>pedal</b> was pressed. Typical operation of London buses was {{they had a very}} low first gear, only used on hills, so the driver when starting would select second gear, depress and release the <b>change</b> gear <b>pedal</b> to engage the transmission, and then select third ready for changing gear on the move, all this done while the bus was still stationary. On starting, just the accelerator pedal was pressed, the gear change to third made at about 15 mph by just pressing the left pedal, and that could well suffice to the next stop where the bus would be stopped in gear and the process repeated.|$|R

40|$|Optimising body {{position}} on the bicycle may improve performance and reduce overuse injury risk. However, effectiveness of bicycle configuration in preventing overuse injuries is unknown as methods to assess {{body position}} on the bicycle (usually via static assessment) lack accuracy and are limited to road cyclists. The aims of this thesis were to: 1) assess validity and reliability of methods for determining body position (kinematics) and pedalling kinetics in cycling; and 2) to analyse effects from changes in saddle height and horizontal position on pedalling kinetics and kinematics of cyclists and triathletes. Pedal force effectiveness, crank torque, joint angles and joint mechanical work during cycling on an ergometer were measured for recreational and competitive road cyclists and competitive triathletes, with and without lower limb pain, in five experimental studies. Analysis of static 6 o’clock crank position was not valid therefore body {{position on the}} bicycle should be measured using video from cycling motion. Instrumented pedals {{should be used for}} pedalling kinetics assessment as bilateral asymmetry was underestimated using the SRM® torque analysis system. Reliability of pedal forces from instrumented pedals computed seven days apart was high. Technique training using feedback from instrumented pedal forces at training workloads and high pedalling cadence improved power output. Using improved knee joint modelling, cyclists with and without pain had similar adaptations to changes in saddle height. Saddle height changes of 5 % of the self-selected preferred saddle height did not result in substantial <b>changes</b> in <b>pedalling</b> kinetics. Moving forward or backward on the saddle affected joint mechanical work but not knee joint forces. Saddle position <b>changed</b> <b>pedalling</b> technique similarly in cyclists and triathletes. To optimise cyclists and triathletes body position on the bicycle and their technique, instrumented pedals should be used to assess pedalling kinetics and video analysis should be used to assess kinematics...|$|R

50|$|In the 19th {{century and}} early 20th century, the pedal {{division}} also underwent <b>changes.</b> The <b>pedal</b> {{divisions of the}} Baroque era often included {{a small number of}} higher-pitched stops, which allowed performers to perform higher melodies on the pedalboard. In the 19th century and early 20th century, organ designers omitted most of these higher-pitched stops, and used pedal divisions which were dominated by 8′ and 16′ stops. This design change, which coincided with the musical trend for music with a deep, rich bass part, meant that the pedalboard was used mainly for the performance of bass parts.|$|R
40|$|This high-fidelity driving {{simulator}} study used a paired comparison design {{to investigate the}} effectiveness of 12 potential eco-driving interfaces. Previous work has demonstrated fuel economy improvements through the provision of in-vehicle eco-driving guidance using a visual or haptic interface. This study uses an eco-driving assistance system that advises {{the driver of the}} most fuel efficient accelerator pedal angle, in real time. Assistance was provided to drivers through a visual dashboard display, a multimodal visual dashboard and auditory tone combination, or a haptic accelerator pedal. The style of advice delivery was varied within each modality. The effectiveness of the eco-driving guidance was assessed via subjective feedback, and objectively through the pedal angle error between system-requested and participant-selected accelerator pedal angle. Comparisons amongst the six haptic systems suggest that drivers are guided best by a force feedback system, where a driver experiences a step change in force applied against their foot when they accelerate inefficiently. Subjective impressions also identified this system as more effective than a stiffness feedback system involving a more gradual <b>change</b> in <b>pedal</b> feedback. For interfaces with a visual component, drivers produced smaller pedal errors with an in-vehicle visual display containing second order information on the required rate of <b>change</b> of <b>pedal</b> angle, in addition to current fuel economy information. This was supported by subjective feedback. The presence of complementary audio alerts improved eco-driving performance and reduced visual distraction from the roadway. The results of this study can inform the further development of an in-vehicle assistance system that supports ‘green’ driving...|$|R

5000|$|The unified rear {{triangle}} or [...] "URT" [...] for short, {{keeps the}} bottom bracket and rear axle directly connected at all times. Suspension action is provided between the rear triangle, which unites rear axle and bottom bracket, {{and the front}} triangle, which unites seat and front axle. This design uses only one pivot, which keeps the number of moving parts down. The fixed length between bottom bracket and rear axle gives the URT the advantage of zero chain growth and consistent front derailleur shifting. Additionally the bike is easily modified into a single-speed. However, as the URT's suspension moves, the distance between seat and <b>pedals</b> <b>changes,</b> detracting from <b>pedaling</b> efficiency. Furthermore, when the rider shifts any weight from the seat to the pedals, {{he or she is}} shifting weight from the sprung part of the bike to the unsprung parts. As such, part of the rider's weight is no longer suspended by the suspension system. Since pedaling itself is a shift of this weight, the design is very prone to suspension bob.|$|R
25|$|Racing cyclists {{often have}} gears {{with a small}} {{relative}} difference of around 7% to 10%; this allows fine adjustment of gear ratios to suit the conditions and maintain a consistent pedalling speed. Mountain bikes and hybrid bikes often have gears with a moderate relative difference of around 15%; this allows for a much larger gear range while having an acceptable step between gears. 3-speed hub gears may have a relative difference of some 33% to 37%; such big steps require a very substantial <b>change</b> in <b>pedalling</b> speed and often feel excessive. A step of 7% corresponds to a 1-tooth change from a 14-tooth sprocket to a 15-tooth sprocket, while a step of 15% corresponds to a 2-tooth change from a 13-tooth sprocket to a 15-tooth sprocket.|$|R

Six male competitive cyclists participated. Each subject {{was asked to}} complete two separate hour long rides using traditional cleat placement and a novel heel placement, respectively. Expired gasses, kinematics, and EMG from 7 lower limb muscles were collected at three time intervals during each ride. No significant difference in O 2 utilization was seen (p= 0. 905). A significant difference was seen in sagittal plane knee angle (p= 0. 008) and angular velocity (p= 0. 003) in the heel condition, demonstrating a more extended knee and lower peaks in angular velocity. Musculo-tendon kinematic data showed no differences. Tibialis anterior (TA) iEMG was higher in the heel condition, and SOL and TA showed differences in timing between conditions.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of gradient on cycling gross efficiency and pedalling technique. METHODS: Eighteen trained cyclists were tested for efficiency, index of pedal force effectiveness (IFE), distribution of power production during the pedal revolution (dead centre size, DC) and timing and level of muscle activity of eight leg muscles. Cycling was performed on a treadmill at gradients of 0 % (level), 4 % and 8 %, each at three different cadences (60, 75 and 90 rev?min). RESULTS: Efficiency was significantly decreased at a gradient of 8 % compared with both 0 % and 4 % (P 0. 05). At a gradient of 8 % there was a larger IFE between 45 ? and 225 ? and larger DC, compared with 0 % and 4 % (P 0. 05). Uphill cycling increased the overall muscle activity level (P < 0. 05), mainly induced by increased calf muscle activity.

AIMS: To compare pedal ergometry with conventional treadmill testing. METHODS: A prospective study was performed where patients presenting with a diagnosis of intermittent claudication were assessed by both methods of testing. RESULTS: Of 78 patients studied with both tests, no exercise-induced ankle pressure changes occurred in 26, two were unable to complete either test despite normal pressure measurements, while 24 had exercise-induced pressure drop detected by both tests. Of patients who completed pedal ergometry, 21 were unable to complete the treadmill test, 14 of whom had negative ergometry, while seven had a pressure drop detected by pedal ergometry. Three had pressure <b>changes</b> with <b>pedal</b> ergometry, but not with treadmill testing and two had pressure changes on the treadmill not reproduced by pedal ergometry.

METHODS: Following a counterbalanced, cross-over design, eight professional cyclists (age (mean +/- SD) : 26 +/- 2 yr, VO 2 max: 74. 0 +/- 5. 7 mL x kg x min) performed three 6 -min bouts at a fixed PO (mean of 366 +/- 37 W) and at a cadence of 60, 80, and 100 rpm. RESULTS: Values of GE averaged 22. 4 +/- 1. 7, 23. 6 +/- 1. 8 and 24. 2 +/- 2. 0 % at 60, 80, and 100 rpm, respectively. Mean GE at 100 rpm was significantly higher than at 60 rpm (P < 0. 05). Similarly, mean values of VO 2, HR, rates of perceived exertion (RPE), lactate and normalized root-mean square EMG (rms-EMG) in both vastus lateralis and gluteus maximum muscles decreased at increasing cadences.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to (1) determine whether bilateral asymmetry in cycling <b>changed</b> systematically with <b>pedaling</b> rate, (2) determine whether the dominant leg as identi"ed by kicking contributed more to average power over a crank cycle than the other leg, and (3) determine whether the dominant leg asymmetry <b>changed</b> systematically with <b>pedaling</b> rate. To achieve these objectives, data were collected from 11 subjects who pedaled at "ve di!erent pedaling rates ranging from 60 to 120 rpm at a constant workrate of 260 W. Bilateral pedal dynamometers measured two orthogonal force components in the plane of the bicycle. From these measurements, asymmetry was quanti"ed by three dependent variables, the percent di!erences in average positive power (%AP), average negative power (%AN), and average crank power (%AC). Di!erences were taken for two cases * with respect to the leg generating the greater total average for each power quantity at 60 rpm disregarding the measure of dominance, and with respect to the dominant leg as determined by kicking. Simple linear regression analyses were performed on these quantities both for the subject sample and for individual subjects. For the subject sample, only the percent di!erence in average negative power exhibited a signi"cant linear relationship with pedaling rate; as pedaling rate increased, the asymmetry decreased. Although the kicking dominant leg contributed signi"cantly greater average crank power than the non-dominant leg for the subject sample, the non-dominant leg contributed signi"cantly greater average positive power and average negative power than the dominant leg.

40|$|Contemporary Etudes for Harp {{consists}} of twelve etudes dealing with two major areas. The primary {{area of concern}} is to expose the harpist {{to many of the}} compositional techniques used in twentieth-century harp music. A second concern deals with the way sounds can be produced on the harp as well as the involvement of the performer in producing sounds. Problems involved in the notation of these special effects are also addressed in these twelve etudes. Etudes I, II, III, IV, VII, IX, and X deal more specifically with compositional techniques that are frequently found in twentieth century harp music. Modality, polytonality, the use of synthetic scales, quartal harmony, non-traditional use of traditional harmony and scales, and mixed and changing meters are included in these chapters. Less-commonly used techniques are found in Etudes V, VI, VIII, XI, and XII. These deal with the use of sounds and silences and their durations, graphic notation, and a simple introduction into aleatoric music. Emphasis is also placed on pitch selection and organization {{through the use of a}} pitch class set and serialism. The level of the etudes ranges from medium to difficult and presupposes that the harpist would be capable of achieving an undergraduate degree in harp performance. The length of the etudes ranges from 2 1 / 2 minutes to 4 minutes. Some of the problems which contribute which contribute to the difficulty to these etudes are the use of rapid <b>pedal</b> <b>changes,</b> three-note <b>pedal</b> glissandos, using a tuning fork to change pitches on a given string, interpreting graphic notation, maintaining a musical sense of direction within a given time frame, and dealing with rapidly changing time signatures. The harpist must also make choices in the order in which events are to occur in the aleatoric piece. In the final etude using graphic notation, singing is required by the harpist. Because new compositional techniques and special effects are continually being introduced, this study is not intended to be all encompassing. It is instead intended to be used for score study and to provide musical studies which clearly demonstrate the specific techniques included in each other. Thesis (D. A. ...|$|R
