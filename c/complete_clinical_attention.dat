This study aimed to describe the clinical course of juvenile dermatomyositis and determine if any early clinical or laboratory features could predict outcome. MethodsMedical charts of patients aged ≤ 18 years and diagnosed with juvenile dermatomyositis (according to the criteria of Bohan and Peter) at the Pediatric Department, National Taiwan University Hospital, between 1989 and 2009 were reviewed. The endpoints for disease assessment were <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response and <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> remission. Cox's proportional hazards model was fitted to identify important predictors of <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> remission. ResultsA total of 39 patients with juvenile dermatomyositis were reviewed. Two-thirds were females, and the mean age at disease onset was 81. 97  ±  46. 63 months. The most common initial presentations were Gottron's papule (82. 1 %) and muscle weakness (82. 1 %). After excluding one patient with an incomplete record, the remaining 31 patients who had muscle weakness were analyzed; among them, 22 (70. 97 %) achieved <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response, but only six (19. 4 %) achieved <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> remission. Multivariate analysis showed that female sex, negative Gowers' sign at disease onset, and positive photosensitivity at disease onset were favorable factors to achieve <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> remission. Moreover, covariate-adjusted survival curves were drawn for making predictions of <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> remission. Only 13 (33. 33 %) patients were symptom free {{at the end of}} follow up, whereas the other 26 suffered from different kinds of complications. None of them developed malignancy, but two (5. 13 %) patients died during the follow-up period. ConclusionFactors such as male sex and Gowers' sign were unlikely to favor the achievement of <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> remission in juvenile dermatomyositis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Complete tumor {{regression}} may develop after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy for distal rectal cancer. Studies {{have suggested that}} selected patients with <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response may avoid radical surgery and close surveillance may provide good outcomes with no oncologic compromise. However, definition of <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response is often imprecise and may vary between different studies. The {{aim of this study}} is to provide a clear definition for a <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy in patients with distal rectal cancer in addition to actual endoscopic videos from patients managed nonoperatively. METHODS: Patients with nonmetastatic distal rectal cancer treated by neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy, including 50. 4 Gy and concomitant 5 -fluorouracil and leucovorin, were assessed for tumor response at least 8 weeks after chemoradiation therapy completion. <b>Complete</b> and incomplete <b>clinical</b> responses were defined based on clinical and endoscopic findings. Patients with <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response were not immediately operated on and were closely followed. Early and late endoscopic findings were recorded. RESULTS: Definition of a <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response should be based on very strict clinical and endoscopic criteria. The finding of any residual superficial ulceration, irregularity, or nodule should prompt surgical attention, including transanal full-thickness excision or even a radical resection with total mesorectal excision. Standard or incisional biopsies should be avoided in this setting. <b>Complete</b> <b>clinical</b> responders should harbor no more than whitening of the mucosa, teleangiectasia with mucosal integrity to be considered for a nonoperative approach. In the presence of these findings, regularly scheduled reassessments may provide a safe alternative to these patients with early detection of recurrent disease. CONCLUSION: Strict definition of the clinical and endoscopic findings of patients experiencing <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy may provide a useful tool for the understanding of outcomes of patients managed with no immediate surgery allowing standardization of classifications and comparison between the experiences of different institutions...|$|R

40|$|Background: Guidelines for {{anal cancer}} {{recommend}} assessment of response at 6 – 12 weeks after starting treatment. Using {{data from the}} ACT II trial, we determined the optimum timepoint to assess clinical tumour response after chemoradiotherapy. Methods: The previously reported ACT II trial was a phase 3 randomised trial of patients of any age with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed, squamous cell carcinoma of the anus without metastatic disease from 59 centres in the UK. We randomly assigned patients (by minimisation) to receive either intravenous mitomycin (one dose of 12 mg/m 2 on day 1) or intravenous cisplatin (one dose of 60 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 29), with intravenous fluorouracil (one dose of 1000 mg/m 2 per day on days 1 – 4 and 29 – 32) and radiotherapy (50 · 4 Gy in 28 daily fractions); and also did a second randomisation after initial therapy to maintenance chemotherapy (fluorouracil and cisplatin) or no maintenance chemotherapy. The primary outcome was <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response (the absence of primary and nodal tumour by clinical examination), in addition to overall survival and progression-free survival from time of randomisation. In this post-hoc analysis, we analysed <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response at three timepoints: 11 weeks {{from the start of}} chemoradiotherapy (assessment 1), 18 weeks from the start of chemoradiotherapy (assessment 2), and 26 weeks from the start of chemoradiotherapy (assessment 3) as well as the overall and progression-free survival estimates of patients with <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response or without <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response at each assessment. We analysed both the overall trial population and a subgroup of patients who had attended each of the three assessments by modified intention-to-treat. This study is registered at controlled-trials. com, ISRCTN 26715889. Findings: We enrolled 940 patients from June 4, 2001, until Dec 16, 2008. <b>Complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response was achieved in 492 (52 %) of 940 patients at assessment 1 (11 weeks), 665 (71 %) of patients at assessment 2 (18 weeks), and 730 (78 %) of patients at assessment 3 (26 weeks). 691 patients attended all three assessments and in this subgroup, <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response was reported in 441 (64 %) patients at assessment 1, 556 (80 %) at assessment 2, and 590 (85 %) at assessments 3. 151 (72 %) of the 209 patients who had not had a <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response at assessment 1 had a <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response by assessment 3. In the overall trial population of 940 patients, 5 year overall survival in patients who had a clinical response at assessments 1, 2, 3 was 83 % (95 % CI 79 – 86), 84 % (81 – 87), and 87 % (84 – 89), respectively and was 72 % (66 – 78), 59 % (49 – 67), and 46 % (37 – 55) for patients who did not have a <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response at assessments 1, 2, 3, respectively. In the subgroup of 691 patients, 5 year overall survival in patients who had a clinical response at assessment 1, 2, 3 was 85 % (81 – 88), 86 % (82 – 88), and 87 % (84 – 90), respectively, and was 75 % (68 – 80), 61 % (50 – 70), and 48 % (36 – 58) for patients who did not have a <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response at assessment 1, 2, 3, respectively. Similarly, progression-free survival in both the overall trial population and the subgroup was longer in patients who had a <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response, compared with patients who did not have a <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response, at all three assessments. Interpretation: Many patients who do not have a <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response when assessed at 11 weeks after commencing chemoradiotherapy do in fact respond by 26 weeks, and the earlier assessment could lead to some patients having unnecessary surgery. Our data suggests that the optimum time for assessment of <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> response after chemoradiotherapy for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anus is 26 weeks from starting chemoradiotherapy. We suggest that guidelines should be revised to indicate that later assessment is acceptable. Funding: Cancer Research UK...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess and compare the {{response}} to two forms of treatment-immobilization with zoledronic acid injection and immobilization with oral weekly Alendronate, in patients with diabetes mellitus and acute Charcot arthropathy (CA) of foot in terms of clinical and radiological parameters. Material and Methods: Patients attending the endocrinology and podiatry clinic with history of diabetes mellitus and Acute CA were taken for study. The patients were randomized into two treatment groups. Group Z-zoledronic acid injection along with total contact cast (TCC). Group A-Tab. Alendronate 70 mg. once a week till the <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> resolution of acute CA along with TCC. Forty-five patients were randomized and 40 of them completed the study. The primary end point was <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> resolution of acute CA-defined as temperature difference between normal and affected foot < 1 oF. Results: Among the 40 patients, 30 (75 %) had <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> resolution. The mean number of days taken for <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> resolution since the initiation of treatment (either Zoledronic acid or Alendronate) was approximately 122 days. There was no significant difference in a number of days required for <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> resolution, between the two forms of therapy. There was more than 50 % reduction in the visual score between the baseline and the final scan. The target to non-target ratio in the skeletal phase also showed an average of 40 % reduction from the baseline to the final skeletal scintigraphy. Conclusion: Both Intravenous Zoledronic acid and oral alendronate had comparable efficacy with respect to the time taken for attaining <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> resolution of acute CA of foot. However, Alendronate therapy was cost effective among the two. 99 m Tc MDP bone scan can be used as an adjuvant to the clinical parameters in assessing the response to therapy...|$|R
