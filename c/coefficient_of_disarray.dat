40|$|Unilocular {{calcareous}} benthic foraminifers {{were studied}} in the size fraction greater than 73 μm in 88 samples (upper Paleocene-Quaternary) from DSDP Site 525. The total number of taxa identified was 159. Comparison of the present data with our previous results for other DSDP Sites did not yield any interoceanic stratigraphic markers. The unilocular benthic calcareous foraminifers of the bathyal zone are of very limited value as guide fossils mainly due to their scarcity and broad vertical ranges. In addition, their use for stratigraphic purposes is seriously hindered by the state <b>of</b> <b>disarray</b> <b>of</b> their taxonomy. -from Author...|$|R
50|$|The {{most telling}} {{part of the}} state <b>of</b> <b>disarray</b> <b>of</b> the once {{powerful}} kingdom was that Takayutpi and his armies chose to retreat to Prome, another kingdom, rather than to their own territory of Martaban whose ruler Takayutpi simply did not trust. The course of retreat was through the Irrawaddy delta. The direct route from Pegu to Prome, though much shorter, involved crossing the Bago Yoma range, and was not practical for large armies. Takayutpi divided the retreating Hanthawaddy forces into two. Five divisions of the army marched by land. Takayutpi and the remaining troops sailed by river in 700 boats.|$|R
