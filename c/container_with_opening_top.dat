There is also an <b>opening</b> at the <b>top</b> of the spear that allows gas (usually carbon dioxide) to drive the beer out of the keg. The coupling fitting has one or two valves that control the flow of beer out of and gas into the keg. The keg {{must be in the}} upright position, that is, <b>with</b> the <b>opening</b> on <b>top,</b> for the beer to be dispensed. Kegs can be contrasted to casks, which have two or more openings and no spear. Most major breweries now use internally speared kegs.|$|R
50|$|These bats cling head-up to {{the smooth}} inner, ventral {{surfaces}} of the rolled up leaves <b>with</b> <b>openings</b> at the <b>top,</b> of Heliconia, sometimes Calathea, {{as well as other}} similar plants, using their adhesive disks. This manner of roosting is said to facilitate rapid escape {{in the event of a}} potential disturbance. The bat’s disks take the shape of concave cups, and are supported by an internal cartilaginous plate. An extrinsic muscle, the flexor pollicis brevis, attaches to the plate, such that contraction of the muscle alters overall disc shape, creating suction. In order to maintain the integrity of the disk, T. tricolor is observed to groom the disk, by frequently licking it. In addition to that, the disk contains sweat glands which discharge onto its peripheries, thereby maintaining it in a constantly moist condition.|$|R

The interface unit will {{become an integral part of}} the process equipment and will cover the functions of docking/undocking the container, opening/closing the door and alignment of wafers to the wafer handler. The functional model was tested with respect to its functions, reliability and particulate contamination. The results will become the basis for future development of interface products. The standardisation of the basic technology of these interface units as well as the transport containers was continued after the project AUTOWEC 2. A set of standards was prepared within the framework of SEMI and internationally discussed which resulted in a consensus of the industry and covers the technology of the functional model. In parallel, the majority of large IC manufacturers world wide decided to use this technology in their future fabs. This important decision of IC manufacturers was based on the technical project results as well as the successful international standardisation. (orig.)

40|$|In {{the design}} {{phase of a}} test site in Indonesia {{computational}} fluid dynamics {{has been used to}} design the construction of the plastic greenhouse. Greenhouses in Indonesia are built to protect the crop from heavy rain and insects. The climate in four different greenhouse designs is calculated without insect gauze and with two types of insect gauze in the openings. Two designs consist of greenhouses <b>with</b> a <b>top</b> <b>opening</b> at one side of the ridge, with different dimensions of the <b>top</b> <b>opening.</b> The third design has no <b>top</b> <b>opening,</b> and the fourth design is the conventional Indonesian design consisting of three spans <b>with</b> an <b>opening</b> {{on one side of the}} ridges. The walls of the greenhouses are open or covered by insect gaze. The ground area in the greenhouse is equal for all designs. The ventilation rate and the maximum temperature in the greenhouse have been used to evaluate the designs. The influence of the wind speed and direction has been investigated. The design without an <b>opening</b> in the <b>top</b> has the highest ventilation rate and the lowest maximum temperature in case of wind due to aerodynamics. In case of no wind the climate in the design without top ventilation is slightly worse than in the other designs. Increasing the length of the greenhouse reduces the ventilation for this design. The insect gauze reduces the ventilation by more than 50 %. Based on these results a new design has been developed <b>with</b> an aerodynamic <b>top</b> <b>opening.</b> This design proved to function with and without wind.
