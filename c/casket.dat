50|$|The {{mourning}} {{hall with}} several rooms where cinerary <b>caskets</b> are placed follows a similar rule: room number one {{has all of}} the cinerary <b>caskets</b> of deceased cadres / officers qualified {{to be buried in}} the graves in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Districts, and cinery <b>caskets</b> of all other deceased would be placed in other rooms. Arrangement of the cinerary <b>caskets</b> also follows the similar rule: the front wall of room number one is reserved for the cinerary <b>caskets</b> of deceased cadres of central government, while side walls of room number one are reserved for the deceased cadres who had no positions in the central government, but held ranks enough to have their cinerary <b>caskets</b> to be placed in room number one. Even for the same wall, there are similar rules for the levels at which the cinerary <b>caskets</b> are placed: the higher the ranks the deceased held, the higher the cinerary <b>caskets</b> is placed.|$|R

5|$|During {{a renewed}} {{investigation}} of the crime in 2005, the Department of Justice exhumed Till's remains to conduct an autopsy and DNA analysis which confirmed the identification of his body.

The <b>casket</b> was discolored and the interior fabric torn. It bore evidence that animals {{had been living in}} it, although its glass top was still intact. The Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. acquired the <b>casket</b> a month later.

50|$|The relics {{from both}} {{locations}} {{were taken to}} England {{and placed in the}} Victoria and Albert Museum, but some discrepancies between Cunningham's description of the <b>caskets</b> and the actual boxes in which the relics were deposited led to speculation that someone transferred the relics from Sanchi to the <b>caskets</b> discovered at Satadhara, and thus what became of the Sanchi steatite <b>caskets</b> is not concretely known.|$|R

5|$|After the match, an in {{ring segment}} {{took place in}} which The Big Show, entered the ring and asked the crowd whether they thought {{he should have been}} in the Championship Scramble for the WWE Championship. SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero, who portrays an {{on-screen}} authority figure for the SmackDown brand, then came to the ring and proceeded to insult the Big Show, and demanded that he leave the ring. Druids then came to the ring bringing a <b>casket,</b> and The Undertaker appeared on the TitanTron, telling Guerrero to either get in the <b>casket</b> herself or he would put her in it. Guerrero refused to enter the <b>casket</b> voluntarily, so The Undertaker began to come to ringside. The Big Show held back Guerrero as The Undertaker came to the ring. Once he was in the ring, The Undertaker began to choke Guerrero, but the Big Show turned heel, becoming a villainous character, by striking The Undertaker and freeing Guerrero. He proceeded to attack The Undertaker, and restrained him to allow Guerrero to slap him and spit in his face.|$|E
