Decrease of bound sialic {{acid and}} {{inhibitor}} in <b>chorioallantoic</b> <b>membranes</b> infected with influenza virus. J.

A further decrease occurred between 1 and 6 hr after infection, indicating that cleavage of the surface glycoprotein was continuing, and that the enzyme may have begun to act upon intracellular glycoprotein. Decreased levels of BSiA continued until 48 hr after infection, possibly {{as a result of}} continued intracellular enzyme activity plus destruction of glycoprotein as virus was released {{from the surface of the}} cells. BSiA began to increase 48 hr after infection, presumably because of regeneration of glycoprotein and its decreased destruction by the viral enzyme, since the process of infection was largely completed.
