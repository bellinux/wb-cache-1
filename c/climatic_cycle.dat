On 24 November, the earliest Total Fire Ban in forty years was proclaimed in Victoria. By February 1983, summer rainfall for Victoria was up to 75% less than in previous years. The first week of February was punctuated by intense heat, with record high temperatures experienced on 1 and 8 February. This combination further destabilised an already volatile fire situation in the forested upland areas surrounding the Victorian and South Australian capitals of Melbourne and Adelaide.|$|E

5000|$|A {{ritual is}} a stereotyped {{sequence}} of activities involving gestures, words, and objects, {{performed in a}} sequestered place, and designed to influence preternatural entities or forces {{on behalf of the}} actors' goals and interests. Rituals may be seasonal, hallowing a culturally defined moment of change in the <b>climatic</b> <b>cycle</b> or the inauguration of an activity such as planting, harvesting, or moving from winter to summer pasture; or they may be contingent, held in response to an individual or collective crisis. Contingent rituals may be further subdivided into life-crisis ceremonies, which are performed at birth, puberty, marriage, death, and so on, to demarcate the passage from one phase to another in the individual's life-cycle, and rituals of affliction, which are performed to placate or exorcise preternatural beings or forces believed to have afflicted villagers with illness, bad luck, gynecological troubles, severe physical injuries, and the like. Other classes of rituals include divinatory rituals; ceremonies performed by political authorities to ensure the health and fertility of human beings, animals, and crops in their territories; initiation into priesthoods devoted to certain deities, into religious associations, or into secret societies; and those accompanying the daily offering of food and libations to deities or ancestral spirits or both.

40|$|Results are {{reported}} of an irrigated experiment {{designed to determine}} the optimum levels of nitrogen for ratoon cane when cut at different ages, and {{at different times of}} the year. The adverse effects of excessive nitrogen on estimated recoverable sugar (e r s) are shown to be more extreme when young cane (12 months old) is cut at an unfavourable (May) compared with a favourable (November) time of the year. In contrast, the time of cutting is relatively unimportant, even at high levels of nitrogen, when the cane is 18 months of age. The uptake of N is more efficient in crops grown during a favourable <b>climatic</b> <b>cycle,</b> viz. November to November or November to 'May, compared with a less favourable cycle, viz. May to May or May to November. Lower levels of nitrogen could be used, therefore, for crops grown during a favourable <b>climatic</b> <b>cycle.</b> High levels of nitrogen would, in general, be more profitable when applied to long (18 -month) rather than to short (12 -month) ratoons.

40|$|International audienceThe Surduk loess {{section in}} Serbia {{provides}} a 20 m thick pedosedimentary {{record of the}} last interglacial–glacial <b>climatic</b> <b>cycle</b> (Upper Pleistocene). Based on optical dating, a chronostratigraphy could be established for the last <b>climatic</b> <b>cycle,</b> yielding the first numerical ages of a loess record from the middle Danube basin. Infrared-stimulated luminescence (IR-OSL) dating {{has been applied to}} the polymineral silt fraction using a multiple aliquot additive-dose protocol to determine the equivalent dose (DE). Within error limits, all age estimates are in stratigraphic order. Owing to the application of shine-plateau tests, the samples showed no evidence of insufficient bleaching. The Surduk loess section comprises three major periods of soil formation. Based on the IR-OSL chronostratigraphy, the lowermost pedocomplex is attributed to the Last Interglacial and to the Early Glacial (Marine Isotope Stage – MIS 5 e to 5 a). The middle part of the section exhibits a succession of weakly developed brown soils and a humic horizon, named 'Surduk soil', formed during MIS 3. On top of the section, recent soil formation is related to the Holocene. Thick loess deposits are preserved between these palaeosols and are attributed to the Lower and Upper Pleniglacials (MIS 4 and 2), respectively. Estimated mean sedimentation rates are 0. 1 – 0. 2 mm/yr for the last glacial cycle, with a strong increase to 0. 6 mm/yr with onset of the Pleniglacial...|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} model {{strategy is}} presented which enables {{the prediction of}} catchment hydrology and the dynamics of sediment transport within the alluvial river systems draining these catchments. The model is driven by AGCM-based weather predictions, generalised by using a stochastic weather generator, and by palaeo-climate and palaeo-environment reconstructions. The model consists of a lumped hydrological rainfall-runoff model, calibrated against modern daily discharge data and the AGCM control experiment, combined with simple modules for hillslope erosion, river channel geometry, sediment transport and fluvial planform type. We apply the model to a conceptualised <b>climatic</b> <b>cycle,</b> and investigate the response to brief climatic events.
