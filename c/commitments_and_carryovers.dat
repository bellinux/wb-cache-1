The former solves hedging rules based on a given poriod’s water supply weighting factor <b>and</b> <b>carryover</b> storage target, while the latter optimization model is used to optimize the weighting factor <b>and</b> <b>carryover</b> storage target based on the hedging rules. The coupling model gives the optimal poriod’s water supply weighting factor <b>and</b> <b>carryover</b> storage target to guide release. The conclusions achieved from this study as follows: (1) the water supply weighting factor <b>and</b> <b>carryover</b> storage target have {{a direct impact on}} the three elements of the hedging rule; (2) parameters can guide reservoirs to supply water reasonably after optimization of the simulation and optimization model; and (3) in order to verify the utility of the hedging rule, the Heiquan reservoir is used as a case study and particle swarm optimization algorithm with a simulation model is adopted for optimizing the parameter. The results show that the proposed hedging rule can improve the operation performances of the water supply reservoir...|$|R

Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to further investigate a relatively new type of therapeutic garment called TheraTogs™ and its effectiveness on the gait pattern and function of a child with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. Methods: A single subject design (ABA withdrawal) was conducted with a 7 year old female with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. The intervention of TheraTogs™ was worn for 6 consecutive hours everyday for 3 weeks. Gait parameters (cadence, velocity, stride length, degrees of toe in/out) were assessed using the GAITRite® system. Function was assessed with the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM). Data was analyzed using the two-standard deviation band method. Results: Statistically significant changes were made in the gait parameters of cadence, velocity, right toe-in/out either during the intervention or carryover phases. However, no statistically significant changes were made in the gait parameters of stride length or left toe-in/out. A decrease in the percentage of the standard deviation between the baseline and intervention phases and the baseline <b>and</b> <b>carryover</b> phases was found in all the gait parameters except for right toe in/out, indicating a decrease in the subject 2 ̆ 7 s gait variability over the course of the study.
