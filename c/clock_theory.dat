50|$|In the mid-1980s, McLeod {{encountered}} {{the work of}} Dutch composer Peter Schat, who had developed a post-tonal compositional technique called the Tone Clock. This technique emphasised the role on forming the chromatic aggregate through the transposition and inversion of three-note chords (trichords). McLeod expanded this technique to encompass all 223 possible set-classes (to use the terminology of Allan Forte's pitch-class set theory), and also developed an exceptionally coherent labelling, categorisation and analytical approach to the chromatic universe.

30|$|A {{key issue}} in the {{reconstruction}} of human peopling history is dating the events related to past human migrations. Population genetics is rather limited in this field compared to archaeology and paleoanthropology which can provide direct absolute dates of human settlements, although with large confidence intervals. However, the genetic literature is full of absolute dates for human prehistory. The main reason is that geneticists use the molecular <b>clock</b> <b>theory</b> to infer the time {{to the most recent}} common ancestor (TMRCA) of each set of haplotypes clustered together (i.e., each haplogroup) in the molecular phylogenies obtained for uniparentally inherited mtDNA and Y chromosome genetic markers. Depending on differences in frequencies or molecular diversity, a geographic origin and a geographic spread are also often inferred for each lineage (hence the term “phylogeography” for this kind of approach).|$|E
40|$|The article {{describes}} the origins and development of internal <b>clock</b> <b>theory.</b> The history is traced via body temperature studies in the 1920 s and 1930 s, with input from 19 th. century and early 20 th. century psychophysics, through to the landmark model of Treisman (1963). This model derived timed behaviour from an interaction of internal clock, memory store, and comparison processes. A successor to Treisman's model was the scalar expectancy theory (SET) of Gibbon and colleagues (1984). The origins of SET in animal Psychology are described, as is its application to human timing (in the early 1990 s), in particular recent work on {{the operation of the}} internal clock itself. Finally, a discussion of some recent developmental studies of timing illustrates both how internal clock models have been applied, and how modern research may require a reconceptualization of the operation of classical internal clock models. ...|$|E

Moreover, for such a distortion related to time, Anderson's team reviewed several models in which time distortion as a phenomenon is considered. They arrived at the [...] "clock acceleration" [...] model after completion of the review. Although the best model adds a quadratic term to defined International Atomic Time, the team encountered problems with this theory.

We argue that standard Einsteinian clocks can be defined in non-Riemannian theories of gravitation by adopting the Weyl group as a local gauge symmetry that preserves the metric and discuss the hypothesis that atomic clocks may be adopted to measure proper time in the presence of non-Riemannian gravitational fields. These ideas are illustrated in terms of a recently developed model of gravitation based on a non-Riemannian space-time geometry. 1 - 2 - 1...|$|R
50|$|According to {{the neutral}} theory, {{mutations}} appear at rate μ {{in each of}} the 2N copies of a gene, and fix with probability 1/(2N). This means that if all mutations were neutral, the rate at which fixed differences accumulate between divergent populations is predicted to be equal to the per-individual mutation rate, e.g. during errors in DNA replication; both are equal to μ. When the proportion of mutations that are neutral is constant, so is the divergence rate between populations. This provides a rationale for the molecular clock, although the discovery of a molecular <b>clock</b> predated neutral <b>theory.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{inhibition}} of spermidine and spermine synthesis by methylglyoxal-Bis(guanylhydrazone) (MeGAG) at concentrations of 5, 10 and 20 μM, induces a reversible metabolic quiescience of mouse embryos, cultured in vitro from the 2 -cell stage, {{at an average}} of 10. 2, 8. 5 and 6. 9 cell stages respectively. In contrast, the {{inhibition of}} putrescine synthesis by α-methylornithine (α-MeOrn) at concentrations up to 10 mM fails to inhibit blastocyst formation, as shown previously. Complete reversibility of this induced arrest of development is observed for treatments up to 31 h with MeGAG at 10 μM. In agreement with the biological <b>clock</b> <b>theory</b> of Smith & MacLaren's hypothesis, the delay in cavitation is proportional to the length of treatment. However, the average cell numbers of the 'delayed nascent blastocysts' of all treated embryos (21. 8 - 24. 2) are consistently lower than that of control embryos (33. 6) irrespective of the duration of treatment. It seems therefore that under some experimental conditions, DNA and chromosome replication {{on the one hand and}} cytoplasmic maturation on the other may be desynchronized. This suggests a role for a cytoplasmic factor in the induction of cavitation. SCOPUS: NotDefined. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterial}} flagellum is {{a highly}} complex prokaryotic organelle. It is the motor that drives bacterial motility, and despite {{the large amount of}} energy required to make and operate flagella, motile organisms have a strong adaptive advantage. Flagellar biogenesis is both complex and highly coordinated and it typically involves at least three two-component systems. Part of the flagellum is a type III secretion system, and it is via this structure that flagellar components are exported. The assembly of a flagellum occurs in a number of stages, and the “checkpoint control” protein FliK functions in this process by detecting when the flagellar hook substructure has reached its optimal length. FliK then terminates hook export and assembly and transmits a signal to begin filament export, the final stage in flagellar biosynthesis. As yet the exact mechanism of how FliK achieves this is not known. Here we review what is known of the FliK protein and discuss the evidence for and against the various hypotheses that have been proposed in recent years to explain how FliK controls hook length, FliK as a molecular ruler, the measuring cup theory, the role of the FliK N terminus, the infrequent molecular ruler theory, and the molecular <b>clock</b> <b>theory...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} evolutionary rate {{measures the}} frequency with which DNA or protein sequence mutations are fixed (i. e., shared by most individuals) in a population. On the other hand, the mutation rate refers to the amount of change in a DNA or protein sequence for a given unit of time. These two intrinsically related processes have been key to our basic understanding of molecular evolution. For example, the molecular <b>clock</b> <b>theory</b> (Zuckerkandl 2 ̆ 6 Pauling 1962) predicts an increase in fixed amino acid mutations of protein sequences as a function of time. The molecular evolutionary rate is then expected to be constant, assuming that mutation rates are the same across the evolutionary lineages of a given protein (Figure 1). The neutral theory of molecular evolution (Kimura 1983) explains this pattern by proposing that most mutations do not {{have an effect on the}} fitness of an organism. Under this model, fixed DNA nucleotide mutations that do not result in changes to protein sequences are referred to as neutral or synonymous substitutions. Also, beneficial mutations are expected to be rare and deleterious ones quickly removed by natural selection. Although the molecular clock and neutral theories are foundational to modern molecular biology, they do not always explain why evolutionary rates vary among genes, proteins, and species. As a result, biologists have begun to consider how organismal-level traits such as life history could influence variation in molecular evolution across the tree of life. This is a central pursuit in evolutionary biology as it is relevant to key concepts such as speciation and the ability of an organism to adapt...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to validate mathematically derived <b>clock</b> synchronization <b>theories</b> and their associated algorithms through experiment. Two theories are considered, the Interactive Convergence Clock Synchronization Algorithm and the Midpoint Algorithm. Special clock circuitry was designed and built so that several operating conditions and failure modes (including malicious failures) could be tested. Both theories are shown to predict conservative upper bounds (i. e., measured values of clock skew were always less than the theory prediction). Insight gained during experimentation led to alternative derivations of the theories. These new theories accurately predict {{the behavior of the}} clock system. It is found that a 100 percent penalty is paid to tolerate worst-case failures. It is also shown that under optimal conditions (with minimum error and no failures) the clock skew can be as much as three clock ticks. Clock skew grows to six clock ticks when failures are present. Finally, it is concluded that one cannot rely solely on test procedures or theoretical analysis to predict worst-case conditions...|$|R
2500|$|An {{alternative}} theory, {{proposed by}} Thomas Cavalier-Smith, was labeled the Neomuran revolution. The designation [...] "Neomuran revolution" [...] {{refers to the}} appearances of the common ancestors of eukaryotes and archaea. Cavalier-Smith proposes that the first neomurans emerged 850 million years ago. Other molecular biologists assume that this group appeared much earlier, but Cavalier-Smith dismisses these claims because {{they are based on}} the [...] "theoretically and empirically" [...] unsound model of molecular <b>clocks.</b> Cavalier-Smith's <b>theory</b> of the Neomuran revolution has implications for the evolutionary history of the cellular machinery for recombination and sex. It suggests that this machinery evolved in two distinct bouts separated by a long period of stasis; first the appearance of recombination machinery in a bacterial ancestor which was maintained for 3 Gy, until the neomuran revolution when the mechanics were adapted to the presence of nucleosomes. The archaeal products of the revolution maintained recombination machinery that was essentially bacterial, whereas the eukaryotic products broke with this bacterial continuity. They introduced cell fusion and ploidy cycles into cell life histories. Cavalier-Smith argues that both bouts of mechanical evolution were motivated by similar selective forces: the need for accurate DNA replication without loss of viability.|$|R

40|$|This {{portfolio}} {{is made up}} of eight works. Et Tu mixes both acoustic and electronic instruments. In addition to traditional compositional techniques it also utilizes digital effects as a means of enhancing the composition. Following that is a collection of four short piano etudes. These pieces were composed as studies of the Tone <b>Clock</b> <b>theory,</b> primarily as a means of acquainting myself with the principles behind the Tone Clock. The first etude, Tea with Chopin, is based on the third hour and utilizes a synthetic scale which I then harmonized to create a unique harmonic palette. Coffee with Beethoven is based on the second hour of the Tone Clock and relies heavily on the octatonic scale. Absinthe with Ligeti is based on the fourth hour. Unlike the previous etudes it is atonal and uses some very complex rhythms. The final etude, Early Morning Raindrops on a Misty Pond, is based on the ninth hour of the Tone Clock. The two hands of the piano play in a highly syncopated manner, creating a free flowing rhythmic texture. The way in which I used the Tone Clock in this piece, as well as its gesturing quality, provided the most insight into the composition of Symphony No. 2. Vengeance is a polystylist piece, blending popular and orchestral music. Through the use of vocals and spoken word it ponders the question of the nature of God and the place of religion in the world. The Call of Capistrano is a piece for solo classical guitar. It is based on sonata form and incorporates percussive elements such as striking the body of the guitar. The portfolio concludes with Symphony No. 2. It is contemporary in style, with little reference to the symphonic writing of the Classical and Romantic periods. Instead it draws inspiration from 20 th century composers such as Lutoslawski and Penderecki. While all the pitches are strictly controlled there are many aleatoric sections where certain liberties can be taken with the rhythms notated and each family of the orchestra will not always play together as a unified section...|$|E
40|$|In many situations, {{timing is}} crucial [...] {{individuals}} face a trade-off between gains from waiting versus {{the risk of}} being preempted. To examine this, we offer a model of clock games, which we then test experimentally. Each player's clock starts upon receiving a signal about a payoff-relevant state variable. Since the timing of the signals is random, clocks are de-synchronized. A player must decide how long, if at all, to delay his move after receiving the signal. We show that (i) delay decreases as clocks become more synchronized, and (ii) when moves are observable, players "herd" immediately after any player makes a move.

In fact, it will be shown that the empirical meaningfulness of both relativity theories depends on what, following Max Born, one might call the "principle of the physical identity of the units of measure".

40|$|In earlier papers {{we showed}} unpredictability beyond quantum {{uncertainty}} in atomic clocks, ensuing from a proven gap between given evidence and explanations of that evidence. Here we reconceive a clock, {{not as an}} isolated entity, but as enmeshed in a self-adjusting communications network adapted to one or another particular investigation, in contact with an unpredictable environment. From the practical uses of clocks, we abstract a clock enlivened with the computational capacity of a Turing machine, modified to transmit and to receive numerical communications. Such "live clocks" phase the steps of their computations to mesh {{with the arrival of}} transmitted numbers. We lift this phasing, known in digital communications, to a principle of logical synchronization, distinct from the synchronization defined by Einstein in special relativity. Logical synchronization elevates digital communication to a topic in physics, including applications to biology. One explores how feedback loops in clocking affect numerical signaling among entities functioning in the face of unpredictable influences, making the influences themselves into subjects of investigation. The formulation of communications networks in terms of live <b>clocks</b> extends information <b>theory</b> by expressing the need to actively maintain communications channels, and potentially, to create or drop them. We show how networks of live clocks are presupposed by the concept of coordinates in a spacetime. A network serves as an organizing principle, even when the concept of the rigid body that anchors a special-relativistic coordinate system is inapplicable, as is the case, for example, in a generic curved spacetime.
