40|$|Quality and {{productivity}} are {{closely associated with}} coolant clarity. "his is an accepted fact in metalworking industries. Part quality characteristics such as surface finish and conformance to dimensional tolerances, and manufacturing productivity indicators such as tool wear and coolant system maintenance are correlated with the amount and size of contaminants in the coolant. This logic and the associated costs vs performance {{provide a basis for}} the economic justification of a <b>coolant</b> filtration system. <b>Filter</b> systems using nonwoven filter media rolls have demonstrated the capability to handle large volumes of <b>coolant</b> flow, <b>filter</b> fine particulates without necessitating a pre-coat, and remove other contaminants from the coolant stream to achieve a functional level of clarity and stability. The component which does the actual filtering of the metalworking fluid is the nonwoven media, making it the single most important element in determinin...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary circuit}} with the VVER 1000 [...] 320 V reactor {{installed}} in the nuclear power plant Temel√≠n represents a world-unique technology in terms of reduction of concentration of corrosion products and activated corrosion products by means of mechanical, high-temperature and high-pressure filters. The technology uses continual filtration and its main advantage is cleaning of the primary coolant at operating parameters, i. e. without any adjustments of pressure and temperature of the <b>filtered</b> <b>coolant.</b> The <b>filter</b> is made of especially treated titanium, whose spongy form improves the required interception of undissolved corrosion products and activated corrosion products on its surface. It contributes to limitation of formation of radiation fields and it favorably affects reduction of the effective dose received by the plants operating personnel. In my thesis I have monitored behavior of the corrosion products and activated corrosion products intercepted on the mechanical, high-temperature and high-pressure filters. In the evaluation I have focused on efficiency of operation {{of one of the}} selected filters in case of changes in physicochemical parameters in the primary circuit during reactor shutdown and on determination of a potential release of corrosion products and activated corrosion products back into the primary coolant and resulting deterioration of a radiation situation in the proximity of the technological equipment before refueling...|$|R

40|$|Research in Institut fuer Produktionstechnik und Spanende Werkzeugmaschinen (Institute of Production Engineering and Machine Tools) at Technische Hochschule Darmstadt (Germany) {{and also}} other institutes show that by {{drilling}} is recognized a development potential in increasing of process precision and reducing of cutting time. With key word complete machining with high speed cutting {{and at the}} same time with high precision, this research is conducted to obtain accurate data and to find the possible potential occurred in this process. HSC-Drilling is machining process, that is different to HSC-turning or milling. By HSC-Drilling the chip removal is more difficult than the others, especially at sack hole. For effective HSC-Drilling, tools with inner coolants are required. This tools need minimal pressure 50 bars, a lot of <b>coolants,</b> and fine <b>filters.</b> Therefore the experiments are carried out at two type of steels 42 CrMo 4 V and 58 CrMoV 4 with carbide tools coated with diverse tools coating such as TiAlN, TiN, etc. As the conclusion resulting from these experiments is the tools coated with TiN (both as a single layer substrate and as multi layers substrate) show the best performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{coolant supply}} uses in typical {{applications}} of metal cutting manufacturing on average 50 % of the electrical energy. A main optimization option is the retrofit of demandbased control {{strategies in the}} supply system. The study {{of the state of}} the art shows that a high energy saving potential remains in central precoat <b>filter</b> systems for <b>coolant</b> cleaning. The achievable flow rate through the precoat filter with the filter pump is reduced in filter operation due to the rising filter resistance. The precoat filters in the filter system need to be regenerated as soon as the achievable flow rate through the filters falls below a certain level. So far the filter pumps are throttled and operated constantly with maximum speed since this allows triggering the regeneration based on the filter pressure. Thereby the filter systems are operated constantly on an excessive power level, independent on the coolant demand. Within this thesis, an automation procedure for an energy efficient operation of central precoat filter systems is presented. The flow rates through the filters are regulated demand-based with a follow-up control using variable speed pumps. Thereby the energy intake is adapted based on the current <b>coolant</b> demand. The <b>filter</b> pressure is no longer utilizable to trigger the filter regeneration due to the variation of the flow rate. Therefore the filter pressure which would arise in uncontrolled operation is reconstructed in controlled operation with measured variables using a model. The presented procedure was successfully implemented in an existing central precoat filter system. The energy saving potential using the existing pumps and throttle setting is 62 %. Simulation results using filter pumps which allow in addition a reduction of the throttle lead to the conclusion that the energy saving potential is 73 %...|$|R
50|$|The engine, {{because it}} is {{indirect}} injection, with a slower combustion burn time than direct injection, is suitable to run on SVO (pure vegetable oil). A feature of the Ricardo Comet pre-chamber design {{is that it makes}} the engine tolerant of low Cetane value fuels such as SVO. The viscosity of vegetable oil when cold is too great for rotary injection pumps, (in particular the weaker Lucas CAV pump, the Bosch VE fuel pump is superior), preventing it from acting as a lubricant and increasing the workload on the distributor/rotary injection pump and damaging it. The Lucas EPIC pump fitted to the 2.1 L 12 valve turbodiesel engine after 1995 is the weakest pump of all. Different fresh vegetable oils have different viscosities: thinnest are; sunflower, rapeseed (often only labelled vegetable oil, but with pictures of distinctive yellow flowers), then soya and corn oil, but palm oil (may be only marked vegetable oil) is thickest and may be solid at room temperature. Vegetable oils thicken when used for cooking, so used oils can be much thicker than any fresh oil, they may even solidify at room temperature. It is necessary for used oil to be very well filtered (ideally cold filtered to 1 micron), to avoid filter plugging and/or injection pump damage. Heavily used oil may be highly acidic and corrode the inside of the injection pump. Such oil can only be used as fuel without the risk of damage, if it has been chemically processed into bio-diesel. The open market price for used oil is often quite close to special offer supermarket prices for new oil, which can be used straight away. In order to reduce the viscosity of the SVO, it should be heated to engine coolant operating temperature, typically with a two tank system, in order to start and shutdown on diesel or bio-diesel. Versions of this engine from the early '90s onward, are typically fitted with a Peugeot-type <b>coolant</b> heated fuel <b>filter</b> that helps heat fuel and reduce viscosity. Fuel / engine coolant heat exchangers, usually required for straight vegetable oil conversions, are still needed for long term life expectancy, or there will be accelerated wear of the fuel injection pump. Heated vegetable oil is a good injection pump lubricant. This is especially important in cold weather ambient temperatures. Mixing with major oil company brand diesel, (which in winter is thinner and contains anti-waxing winterising agents) to thin the vegetable oil fuel, choosing a thin vegetable oil, winterising additive, or electric heating, or a combination of these are helpful especially when starting and warming up, as coolant heating will not yet be at operating temperature. The difference between the use of good quality fuel and supermarket diesel, in a diesel / vegetable oil fuel mix, will be very noticeable, especially at lower temperatures. The fuel systems used on this engine return heated fuel to the fuel tank. Running with half a tank of fuel instead of fully filling up, will allow the tank to be heated more effectively by this warmed fuel in low ambient temperatures. Due to different calorific values some oils will give less mpg and some more.|$|R
