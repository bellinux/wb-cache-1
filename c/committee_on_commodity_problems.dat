40|$|Abstract. The use {{of visual}} sensing for action {{generation}} in unknown environments {{is an attractive}} option due to the great representation power of vision, but it is challenging for two reasons. The representations used in vision are often not well suitable for planning, thus requiring complex learning approaches. Furthermore, an active agent needs to make decisions on-line, without the delay of o-line processing. This paper proposes to combine monocular visual SLAM with dense visual reconstruction techniques {{in order to build}} geometrically correct three-dimensional models, which can be used for action generation, such as path or grasp planning in a robotic system. We propose a vision only monocular solution which will run on-line <b>on</b> <b>commodity</b> hardware. The <b>problem</b> is very challenging and currently no complete solutions exist, though similar o-line systems are quite mature. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a performance-based {{technique}} to help synthesize high-bandwidth radar processors <b>on</b> <b>commodity</b> platforms. This <b>problem</b> is innately complex, {{for a number of}} reasons. Contemporary radars are very compute-intensive: they have high pulse rates, and they sample a large amount of range readings at each pulse. Indeed, modern radar processors can require CPU loads of in high-gigaflop to tera-flop ranges, performance which is only achieved by exploiting the radar's inherent data parallelism. Next-generation radars are slated to operate on scalable clusters of commodity systems. Throughput is only one problem. Since radars are usually embedded within larger realtime applications, they also must adhere to latency (or deadline) constraints. Building an embedded radar processor on a network of workstations (or a NOW) involves partitioning load in a balanced fashion, accounting for stochastic effects injected on all software-based systems, synthesizing runtime parameters for [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The wide {{adoption}} of non-executable page protections in recent versions of popular operating systems {{has given rise}} to attacks that employ return-oriented programming (ROP) to achieve arbitrary code execution without the injection of any code. Existing defenses against ROP exploits either require source code or symbolic debugging information, impose a significant runtime overhead, which limits their applicability for the protection of third-party applications, or may require to make some assumptions about the executable code of the protected applications. We propose kBouncer, an efficient and fully transparent ROP mitigation technique that does not requires source code or debug symbols. kBouncer is based on runtime detection of abnormal control transfers using hardware features found <b>on</b> <b>commodity</b> processors. 1 <b>Problem</b> Description The introduction of non-executable memory page protections {{led to the development of}} the return-to-libc exploitation technique [11]. Using this method, a memory corruption vulnerability can be exploited by transferring control to code that already exists in the address space of the vulnerable process. By jumping to the beginning of a library function such as WinExec(),the attacker can for example spawn a shell withou...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} multi {{commodity}} uncapacitated network design problem, {{which is known}} to be NP-complete. We also study the capacitated one facility non-bifurcated version of the problem in which flow of a commodity is restricted to flow on at most two paths. We describe an exact O(n 2 2 K + n 3 K) algorithm for these two versions of the multi <b>commodity</b> <b>problem.</b> This algorithm {{can also be used to}} solve the directed version of the Steiner tree problem and performs a little better than the O(n 2 2 K + n 3 K + n 3) dynamic programming based algorithm due to Dreyfus and Wagner (1971). We also describe the convex hull of integer solutions to the two <b>commodity</b> uncapacitated <b>problem</b> using O(m) variables and O(n) constraints. We show that the capacitated two <b>commodity</b> <b>problem</b> can be solved either by using any standard shortest path algorithm or by the O(n 2) algorithm described for the uncapacitated case.
