40|$|Germline {{stem cells}} in the Drosophila ovary are {{maintained}} by a somatic niche. The niche is structurally and functionally complex and contains four cell types, the escort, cap, and terminal filament cells and the newly identified transition cell. We find that the large Maf transcription factor Traffic jam (Tj) is essential for determining niche cell fates and architecture, enabling each niche in the ovary to support a normal complement of 2 - 3 germline stem cells. In particular, we focused {{on the question of}} how <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> form. <b>Cap</b> <b>cells</b> express Tj and are considered the key component of a mature germline stem cell niche. We conclude that Tj controls the specification of <b>cap</b> <b>cells,</b> as the complete loss of Tj function caused the development of additional terminal filament cells at the expense of <b>cap</b> <b>cells,</b> and terminal filament <b>cells</b> developed <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> characteristics when induced to express Tj. Further, we propose that Tj controls the morphogenetic behavior of <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> as they adopted the shape and spatial organization of terminal filament cells but otherwise appeared to retain their fate when Tj expression was only partially reduced. Our data indicate that Tj contributes to the establishment of germline stem cells by promoting the <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> fate, and controls the stem cell-carrying capacity of the niche by regulating niche architecture. Analysis of the interactions between Tj and the Notch (N) pathway indicates that Tj and N have distinct functions in the <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> specification program. We propose that formation of <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> depends on the combined activities of Tj and the N pathway, with Tj promoting the <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> fate by blocking the terminal filament cell fate, and N supporting <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> by preventing the escort cell fate and/or controlling the number of <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> precursors...|$|R
40|$|Accessory cells, {{which include}} glia and other cell types that develop in close {{association}} with neurons, {{have been shown}} to play key roles in regulating neuron development. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. A particularly intimate association between accessory cells and neurons is found in insect chordotonal organs. We have found that the <b>cap</b> <b>cell,</b> one of two accessory cells of v'ch 1, a chordotonal organ in the Drosophila embryo, strongly influences the development of its associated neuron. As it projects a long dorsally directed cellular extension, the <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> reorients the dendrite of the v'ch 1 neuron and tows its <b>cell</b> body dorsally. <b>Cap</b> <b>cell</b> morphogenesis is regulated by Netrin-A, which is produced by epidermal cells at the destination of the <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> process. In Netrin-A mutant embryos, the <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> forms an aberrant, ventrally directed process. As the <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> maintains a close physical connection with the tip of the dendrite, the latter is dragged into an abnormal position and orientation, and the neuron fails to undergo its normal dorsal migration. Misexpression of Netrin-A in oenocytes, secretory cells that lie ventral to the <b>cap</b> <b>cell,</b> leads to aberrant <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> morphogenesis, suggesting that Netrin-A acts as an instructive cue to direct the growth of the <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> process.

40|$|During spermatogenesis, several {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in a germ cell-specific manner. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} rat and mouse spermatogenic cells produce a 1, 700 -nucleotide proenkephalin RNA, while somatic cells that express the proenkephalin gene contain a 1, 450 -nucleotide transcript. Using cDNA cloning, RNA protection, and primer extension analyses, we showed that transcription of the rat and mouse spermatogenic-cell RNAs is initiated downstream from the proenkephalin somatic promoter in the first somatic intron (intron As). In both species, the germ <b>cell</b> <b>cap</b> site region consists of multiple start sites distributed over a length of approximately 30 base pairs. Within rat and mouse intron As, the region upstream of the germ <b>cell</b> <b>cap</b> sites is GC rich and lacks TATA sequences. A consensus binding site for the transcription factor SP 1 was identified in intron As downstream of the proenkephalin germ <b>cell</b> <b>cap</b> site region. These features are characteristic of several previously described promoters that lack TATA sequences. Homologies were also identified between the proenkephalin and rat cytochrome c spermatogenic-cell promoters, including the absence of a TATA box, a multiple start site region, and several common sequences. This promoter motif thus may be shared with other genes expressed in male germ cells...|$|E

METHODS: LNCaP cells transfected with PCDH-PC were tested {{for their ability to}} grow in vitro and in vivo in androgen-deprived conditions. PCDH-PC mRNA expression was evaluated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and by in situ hybridization. RESULTS: PCDH-PC expression induced Wnt signaling in <b>CaP</b> <b>cells</b> and permitted androgen-independent growth of hormone-sensitive <b>CaP</b> <b>cells.</b> Expression of PCDH-PC-homologous transcripts was low and restricted to some epithelial cells in normal tissue and to <b>CaP</b> <b>cells</b> in tumors.

Previous {{studies have suggested}} that the neurons may be separated into two anatomical subtypes on the basis of percent apposition (PA); that is, the percentage of the soma apposed by synaptic terminals. The present study combined tract tracing with synaptic immunolabeling to compare the soma area, relative number, and location of Type I (low PA) and Type II (high PA) commissural neurons in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) of rats. Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that 261 of 377 (69 %) commissural neurons have medium-sized somata with Type I axosomatic innervation. The commissural neurons also showed distinct topographical distributions. The majority of Type I neurons were located in the small <b>cell</b> <b>cap</b> of the VCN, which serves as a nexus for regulatory pathways within the auditory brainstem. Most Type II neurons were found in the magnocellular core.

To visualize GABAA binding sites, GABAB binding sites were blocked with +/-baclofen. To visualize GABAB binding sites, isoguvacine was used to block GABAA binding sites. GABAA binding sites predominated over GABAB, although there were marked regional differences {{in the distribution of}} binding. In the ventral cochlear nucleus, GABAA and GABAB binding sites were concentrated in the peripheral granule <b>cell</b> <b>cap,</b> with low binding levels in the central region. In the dorsal cochlear nucleus, binding was concentrated in the superficial (fusiform and molecular) layers, with a distinct laminar pattern. GABAA binding sites predominated in the fusiform cell layer. The molecular layer contained the highest level of GABAB binding sites in the entire cochlear nucleus. These results suggest that GABAergic inhibition in the cochlear nucleus is mediated both by GABAA and GABAB receptors, particularly in the dorsal cochlear nucleus. However, low levels of binding in areas such as the magnocellular regions of the ventral cochlear nucleus, known to contain abundant GABAergic synapses, suggest heterogeneity of GABA receptors in this auditory nucleus...|$|E
40|$|It is {{currently}} {{unclear whether the}} T cell dysfunctions observed during active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) reflect a disorder intrinsic to the T cell or defects that result from interaction with anti-T cell autoantibody. To determine whether a disorder intrinsic to the T cell exists in SLE, the T <b>cell</b> <b>capping</b> mechanism was selected {{as a model of}} cellular function. The normal T <b>cell</b> <b>capping</b> mechanism is a rapid, energy-dependent and coordinated sequence of membrane events that consists of microaggregation, capping, endocytosis, and regeneration of the surface molecule. The monoclonal antibodies OKT 3, OKT 4, and OKT 8, directed against the T cell-specific membrane glycoproteins T- 3, T- 4, T- 8, served as specific probes of the glycoproteins' mobility within the membrane and membrane glycoprotein regeneration. When compared with greater than 91 % T <b>cell</b> <b>capping</b> in normal and control subjects with active Sjögren's syndrome, active rheumatoid arthritis and active tuberculosis, only 49 - 60 % of T cells from active SLE patients completed the capping sequence (SLE vs. healthy controls; T- 3, P less than 0. 002; T- 4, P less than 0. 004; T- 8, P less than 0. 002). Colchicine (10 (- 5) M), which inhibits microtuble polymerization and augments the rate of normal T <b>cell</b> <b>capping,</b> failed to restore the abnormal capping. However, as judged by the elapsed time intervals to half-maximal capping, the capping kinetics of the T cells able to initiate capping were not significantly different from controls. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated an abnormal staining pattern characterized by microaggregation of ligand-glycoprotein complexes on resting T cells, coarse aggregation of ligand-glycoprotein complexes over the surfaces of cells that failed to cap, and cleaved or disrupted caps. After clearance of determinants by capping, greater than 94 % of T cells from healthy controls regenerated T- 3, - 4, and - 8 within 24 h. In contrast, only 20 - 40 % of <b>capped</b> T <b>cells</b> from active SLE patients reexpressed new determinants. With improving disease activity, the proportion of <b>cells</b> <b>capping</b> and regenerating T- 3, - 4, and - 8 increased, but remained significantly below control levels. In conclusion, this study has identified a disorder of T cell surface glycoprotein mobility and regeneration affecting the majority (60 - 80 %) of both the T- 3 +, T- 4 +, (inducer/helper), and T- 3 +, T- 8 + (suppressor) subsets during active SLE. Although the impaired capping and reexpression improve with disease remission, a residual defect persists. The data support the concept of a disorder intrinsic to the T cell in SLE...|$|R

Cells were clustered and attached to each other and to the substrate along their lateral margins. Most nests were covered with separate layers of soil (surface ornamented in various ways) that camouflaged the nest against natural enemies and protected it against extreme temperatures. The larva, after consuming its provision, spun a cocoon which closely adhered to the inner surface of the cell, and then voided its feces across the bottom of the cell. The post-defecated larva subsequently migrated to the anterior limit of the cell where it firmly appressed against the cocoon as it assumed a strongly decurved, overwintering, prepupal position.

40|$|The {{cochlear}} nucleus (CN) is {{the first}} auditory structure to receive binaural information via CN-commissural connections. In spite of an abundance of evidence that CN-commissural neurons are glycinergic and thus inhibitory, physiological, and anatomical evidence suggests that {{a small group of}} CN-commissural neurons are excitatory. In this study, we examined the excitatory portion of the CN-commissural pathway by combining anterograde tract tracing with immunohistochemistry of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) and retrograde tract tracing with immunohistochemistry of glycine and GABA. VGLUTs accumulate glutamate in synaptic vesicles and are prime markers for glutamatergic neurons. The terminal endings of CN-commissural projections were typically en passant or small terminal boutons, but large, irregular swellings were also observed, confined to the granule cell domain (GCD). Both small and large terminal endings in the GCD colabeled with VGLUT 2, but not VGLUT 1. In addition, some CN-commissural cells themselves received VGLUT 2 -positive puncta on their somata. After large injections into the CN, 37 % {{of the total number of}} retrogradely labeled commissural neurons was immunonegative to glycine or GABA. Retrograde labeling after a restricted GCD injection revealed a majority of putative excitatory CN-commissural neurons as multipolar, in the marginal regions of the ventral CN, medially as well as in the small <b>cell</b> <b>cap</b> region and deep dorsal CN. These results provide direct anatomical evidence that an excitatory commissural projection is present, and VGLUT 2 is associated with this pathway both as its source and as a recipient...|$|E
40|$|Apo E 3 -leiden {{transgenic}} mice express human dysfunctional apo E variant {{and develop}} hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis {{on a high}} fat/high cholesterol diet. We characterized diet-induced atherosclerotic lesions in apo E 3 -leiden transgenic mice using immunocytochemical methods {{in order to examine}} foam cell formation and determine whether advanced atherosclerotic lesions develop in these animals. Special attention was given to the presence of oxidized lipoproteins and expression of lipoprotein receptors. Plasma cholesterol levels in apo E 3 -leiden mice on an atherogenic diet increased from 2 to 36 mmol/l in 4 months. At this time apo E 3 -leiden mice had developed lesions, which ranged from early fatty streaks in thoracic and abdominal aorta to advanced lesions in aortic arch. Early fatty streaks were entirely composed of macrophages which also expressed scavenger receptors. Epitopes characteristic of oxidized LDL were present in macrophage-rich foam cells. Advanced atherosclerotic lesions also developed in apo E 3 -leiden mice including smooth muscle <b>cell</b> <b>cap</b> formation and erosion of the media. Macrophages and epitopes characteristic of oxidized LDL were present in core and shoulder regions. Scavenger receptors were expressed in macrophages in advanced lesions, whereas LDL-receptor-related protein (LRP) was mainly expressed in smooth muscle cells. It is concluded that: (1) macrophages are the major cell type in both early and advanced atherosclerotic lesions; (2) scavenger receptors and oxidized lipoproteins are present in lesion macrophages; and (3) LRP is mostly expressed in smooth muscle cells. Thus, lesions in apo E 3 -leiden transgenic mice have features in common with human atherosclerosis. Since lesion macrophages also retain their ability to synthesize endogenous apo E, apo E 3 -leiden transgenic mouse may be a useful model for studies on the development and genetics of atherosclerosis...|$|E

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Anatomy and PhysiologyDeryl L. TroyerMany cell types {{were known}} to have migratory {{properties}} towards tumors and different research groups have shown reliable results regarding cells as delivery vehicles of therapeutics for targeted cancer treatment. Present report discusses proof of concept for 1. Cell mediated delivery of Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and targeted Magnetic hyperthermia (MHT) as a cancer treatment by using in vivo mouse cancer models, 2. Cells surface engineering with chimeric proteins for targeted cancer treatment by using in vitro models. 1. Tumor homing cells can carry MNPs specifically to the tumor site and tumor burden will decrease after alternating magnetic field (AMF) exposure. To test this hypothesis, first we loaded Fe/Fe 3 O 4 bi-magnetic NPs into neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which were previously shown to migrate towards melanoma tumors. We observed that NPCs loaded with MNPs travel to subcutaneous melanoma tumors. After alternating magnetic field (AMF) exposure, the targeted delivery of MNPs by the NPCs resulted in a mild decrease in tumor size (Chapter- 2). Monocytes/macrophages (Mo/Ma) are known to infiltrate tumor sites, and also have phagocytic activity which can increase their uptake of MNPs. To test Mo/Ma-mediated MHT we transplanted Mo/Ma loaded with MNPs into a mouse model of pancreatic peritoneal carcinomatosis. We observed that MNP-loaded Mo/Ma infiltrated pancreatic tumors and, after AMF treatment, significantly prolonged the lives of mice bearing disseminated intraperitoneal pancreatic tumors (Chapter- 3). 2. Targeted cancer treatment could be achieved by engineering tumor homing cell surfaces with tumor proteases cleavable, cancer cell specific recombinant therapeutic proteins. To test this, Urokinase and Calpain (tumor specific proteases) cleavable; prostate cancer <b>cell</b> (<b>CaP)</b> specific (CaP 1 targeting peptide); apoptosis inducible (Caspase 3 V 266 ED 3) - rCasp 3 V 266 ED 3 chimeric protein was designed in silico.

Further, Urokinase (uPA) mediated cleavage and release of rCasp 3 V 266 ED 3 from engineered cells was tested (Chapter- 4). Animal models for cancer therapy are invaluable for preclinical testing of potential cancer treatments.

40|$|Overwintering larvae of Colletes kincaidii Cockerell were {{obtained}} by removing soil blocks from a large nesting site established in a hardened, vertical sandstone cliff at Bonny Doon, Calif. One sandstone block {{was placed in a}} greenhouse at Logan, Utah, where two emerging females established nests within glass tubes inserted into observation boxes and one female excavated a nest in soil beneath the sandstone block from which she emerged. Observations of nesting biology in glass tube nests showed {{for the first time that}} polyester cell linings are composed of a mixture of salivary and Dufour 2 ̆ 7 s gland materials. Salivary secretion is first brushed onto nest walls with the glossa; Dufour 2 ̆ 7 s gland liquid is deposited on top of the salivary layer and brushed into a thin cover layer with the bifid glossa. The careful sequence of glandular deposition, combined with physical evidence obtained during observations, suggests that salivary gland material may carry an enzyme that links lactones derived from the Dufour 2 ̆ 7 s gland into polyester chains that are incorporated into cell linings. Cell platform construction and how this platform is used to position the female during the act of egg deposition are described. The physical restructuring of the platform into a <b>cell</b> <b>cap</b> immediately after the egg is deposited is also described. Cell provisioning and methods used to deposit the egg are described in detail. Late embryogenesis and immature development were observed in the laboratory using in vivo and in vitro methods. These observations confirm the 1800 rotation of the embryo, eclosion from the egg chorion as a second instar, anus-to-mouth feeding habits of the larva, and the migration pattern of the larva from its position within the egg to the cup-shaped central position on the surface of the cell provisions. Supportive studies in the field confirmed that some females in a nesting population excavate their entire burrow system while others use abandoned nests and extend lateral burrows before constructing cell series in these new excavations; some females use abandoned nests to construct cell series only within the residue cell linings produced by previous generations. These studies also confirmed that anyone cell of C. kincaidii is provisioned with only one pollen host species, but any number of pollen host species can be used by the same individual, different individuals, or populations that are distributed across North America; and that Epeolus compactus Cresson and Paravilla fumosa Hall were found parasitizing C. kincaidii.

Top of membrane holder will be flush with bottom of slots in cell body. - Push filtrate exit tubing onto exit spout of membrane support. - Place stirrer assembly into cell body. When properly installed, arms of stirrer assembly will rest on small ridge inside top of cell body. - Introduce sample into cell. - With a twisting motion, push cap down onto cell body, orienting gas inlet port on cap opposite filtrate exit port on holder. If cap assembly does not slide easily, lubricate O-ring lightly with petroleum jelly. **Do not allow petroleum jelly to contact membrane!** - Set pressure-relief valve to horizontal (open) position. - Slide cell into retaining stand, fitting ring on cell base into hole in stand. Flattened edges on bottom flange of cap ensures that cell is inserted properly and prevents rotation of cell once inside stand. - Turn pressure-relief valve to vertical (closed) position. - Attach {{gas pressure}} line. ### Operation 1. Place cell on magnetic stirring table. - Connect inlet line to regulated gas pressure source (Nitrogen gas is recommended for pressurizing cell! Use of compressed air can cause large pH shifts due to dissolution of carbon dioxide. With sensitive solutions, oxidation can also occur, leading to other potential problems.) - Hold cell steady on the stirring table and pressurize according to instructions in membrane package. Generally ** 55 psi** (3. 7 kg/cm 2) is optimal, maximal 70 psi (4. 7 kg/cm 2) nitrogen gas pressure. Cap assembly moves upward, forming a secure lock with retaining stand once system is pressurized. - Turn on stirring table and adjust stirring rate until the vortex created is approximately one-third {{the depth of the}} liquid volume. - Monitor concentration. Do not allow retentate to run through. - Collect permeate. - Highly viscous solutions filter slowly, as do solutions containing particulate matter, such as colloids. Where the viscous agent (sucrose, glycerin, etc.) is to be removed, flow can often be increased by predilution. - **Prefilter or centrifuge** any solution containing particulate matter, such as cell debris or precipitates. - To maximize recovery of retained substances, continue stirring for a few minutes after depressurization. This will resuspend the polarized layer at the membrane surface. - When finished, turn off nitrogen pressure source and stirring table. - Vent pressure inside cell by slowly turning pressure-relief knob to horizontal position. Push cap down, then slide cell out from retaining stand. *Note: Overly rapid depressurization can cause the membrane to buckle up and rupture*. - Using a twisting motion, remove <b>cell</b> <b>cap</b> and the magnetic stirrer assembly. Always remove the cell top with the pressure-relief valve set to the horizontal (open) position. Removal in vertical (closed) position can create a partial vacuum which can rupture the membrane! Pour out solution. - Disassemble cell, then wash all components with a mild detergent/water solution, then rinse thoroughly. Caustic cleaning solutions may damage the anodized aluminum retaining stand. Leave ultrafiltration cell disassembled whenever it is unlikely to be used for several weeks. ### Limits - max. cell operating **pressure**: 75 psi (5. 3 kg/cm 2) - max. membrane operating pressure: 70 psi (4. 7 kg/cm 2) - pressure-relief valve preset: 90 psi (6. 3 kg/cm 2) - Although brief exposure to higher **temperatures** is possible, do not operate cell continuously above 85 °C (185 °F). - **pH** 2 to 10 - Do not use the following **chemicals**: Ketones (including acetone), Aromatic hydrocarbons (including toluene), Cellosolvers, Halogenated hydrocarbons, DMF, Aliphatic esters, DMSO, Polar Aromatics. *Note:The spring in the pressure-relief valve is not compatible with 0. 1 N NaOH*. ### Sterilization Amicon stirred ultrafiltration cells can be autoclaved at 121 °C (250 °F) for 30 minutes. They are compatible with standard sterilizing gas mixtures, 70 % ethanol, isopropanol or 5 % formalin. **CAUTION**: Tighten the base partially before autoclaving. ### Maintenance - Replace O-rings {{at the first sign of}} damage or wear. - If installation or removal of cap assembly becomes difficult, lubricate cap O-ring with a small amount of petroleum jelly. **Do not allow petroleum jelly to come in contact with membrane!** - Check stirrer periodically for rough edges that could possibly damage the membrane. - Replace transparent body immediately should it become cracked or crazed. ### Troubleshooting **Little or no filtrate obtained:** 1. Rotate pressure-relief valve to check for pressure. If not pressurized, check nitrogen source and regulator. - Make sure glossy side of disc membrane faces up. - If sample solution is highly viscous due to microsolutes, either dilute or diafilter to increase flow rate. - Check membrane holder and filtrate port for blockage. **Filtrate rate abnormally high:** 1. Check membrane for lesions, scratches, or roughness. - Make sure correct membrane type is being used. - Check stirrer assembly to ensure that stirring bar is not contacting the membrane surface. **Cell leaks:** 1. Be sure lower O-ring rests entirely on the membrane peripheral surface. - Check O-rings for nicks and cuts. - Make sure membrane support is seated properly, and that the base is screwed in firmly. - Make sure O-rings are not squeezed out of slots. - Check fittings on gas inlet tubing for correct order and position...|$|E
40|$|The human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) replicates to high titers {{in primary}} human fibroblast cell cultures. A variety of primary human cells and some tumor-derived cell lines do also support permissive HCMV replication, yet at low levels. Cell lines established by transfection of the transforming functions of adenoviruses have been notoriously resistant to HCMV replication and progeny production. Here, we provide first-time {{evidence that a}} permanent cell line immortalized by adenovirus type 5 E 1 A and E 1 B (CAP) is supporting the full HCMV replication cycle and is releasing infectious progeny. The <b>CAP</b> <b>cell</b> line had previously been established from amniotic fluid cells which were likely derived from membranes of the developing fetus. These cells can be grown under serum-free conditions. HCMV efficiently penetrated <b>CAP</b> <b>cells,</b> expressed its immediate-early proteins and dispersed restrictive PML-bodies. Viral DNA replication was initiated and viral progeny became detectable by electron microscopy in <b>CAP</b> <b>cells.</b> Furthermore, infectious virus was released from <b>CAP</b> <b>cells,</b> yet to lower levels compared to fibroblasts. Subviral dense bodies were also secreted from <b>CAP</b> <b>cells.</b> The results show that E 1 A/E 1 B expression in transformed cells is not generally repressive to HCMV replication and that <b>CAP</b> <b>cells</b> {{may be a good}} substrate for dense body based vaccine production...|$|R
5000|$|In Drosophila melanogaster, the GSC niche {{resides in}} the anterior-most region of each ovariole, known as the germarium. The GSC niche {{consists}} of necessary somatic cells-terminal filament <b>cells,</b> <b>cap</b> <b>cells,</b> escort cells, and other stem cells which function to maintain the GSCs. The GSC niche holds on average 2-3 GSCs, which are directly attached to somatic <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> and Escort stem cells, which send maintenance signals directly to the GSCs. [...] GSCs are easily identified through histological staining against vasa protein (to identify germ cells) and 1B1 protein (to outline cell structures and a germline specific fusome structure). Their physical attachment to the <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> is necessary for their maintenance and activity. A GSC will divide asymmetrically to produce one daughter cystoblast, which then undergoes 4 rounds of incomplete mitosis as it progresses down the ovariole (through the process of oogenesis) eventually emerging as a mature egg chamber; the fusome found in the GSCs functions in cyst formation and may regulate asymmetrical cell divisions of the GSCs. [...] Because of the abundant genetic tools available for use in Drosophila melanogaster and the ease of detecting GSCs through histological stainings, researchers have uncovered several molecular pathways controlling GSC maintenance and activity.|$|R
50|$|In {{developing}} mammary glands, {{the growing}} {{tips of the}} ductal network consist of two layers made up of luminal epithelial <b>cells</b> and <b>cap</b> <b>cells.</b> The luminal cells secrete netrin 1, which binds to the receptor neogenin (a homologue of DCC) on the <b>cap</b> <b>cells.</b> This allows for adhesion between the two cell layers, which {{is necessary for the}} proper morphogenesis of the terminal end buds (TEBs) in the mammary glands. Loss of the gene coding for either netrin 1 or neogenin led to the improper formation of the (TEBs), suggesting that rather than acting as a guidance molecule as in neuronal systems, netrin 1 serves as an adhesive in mammary tissue.|$|R

40|$|Cap 43 is {{a protein}} whose RNA is induced under {{conditions}} of severe hypoxia or prolonged elevations of intracellular calcium. Additionally, Ni and Co also induce Cap 43 because they produce a state of hypoxia in <b>cells.</b> <b>Cap</b> 43 protein is expressed at low levels in normal tissues; however, {{in a variety of}} cancers, including lung, brain, melanoma, liver, prostate, breast, and renal cancers, Cap 43 protein is overexpressed in cancer cells. The low level of expression of Cap 43 in some normal tissues compared with their cancerous counterparts, combined with the high stability of Cap 43 protein and mRNA, makes the Cap 43 gene a new, important cancer marker. We hypothesize that the mechanism of Cap 43 overexpression in cancer cells involves a state of hypoxia characteristic of cancer <b>cells</b> where the <b>Cap</b> 43 protein becomes a signature for thi...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} concanavalin A (Con A) induced changes in the locations of actin, myosin, 120 K, and 95 K (~-actinin) {{to determine the extent}} to which actin and myosin are reorganized during capping and the roles that 120 K and 95 K might play in this reorganization. We observed the location of each protein by indirect immunofluorescence using affinity purified antibodies. Four morphological states were distinguished in vegetative Dictyostelium amebae: ameboid cells before Con A binding, patched <b>cells,</b> <b>capped</b> <b>cells,</b> and ameboid <b>cells</b> with <b>caps.</b> The location of each protein was distinct in ameboid cells both before and after capping. Actin and 120 K were found in the cell cortex usually associated with surface projections, and myosin and 95 K were diffusely distributed. Myosin was excluded from surface projections in ameboid cells. During patching, all four proteins were localized below Con A patches. During capping, actin, myosin, and 95 K protein moved with the Con A patches into the cap whereas 120 K protein was excluded from the cap. During the late stages of cap formation actin and myosin were progressively lost from the cap, and 120 K became concentrated in new actinfilled projections that formed away from the cap. However, 95 K remained tightly associate...|$|R
40|$|Cyclase-associated {{proteins}} (CAPs) {{are highly}} conserved actin monomer binding proteins {{present in all}} eukaryotes. However, the mechanism by which CAPs contribute to actin dynamics has been elusive. In mammals, the situation is further complicated {{by the presence of}} two CAP isoforms whose differences have not been characterized. Here, we show that CAP 1 is widely expressed in mouse nonmuscle <b>cells,</b> whereas <b>CAP</b> 2 is the predominant isoform in developing striated muscles. In cultured NIH 3 T 3 and B 16 F 1 <b>cells,</b> <b>CAP</b> 1 is a highly abundant protein that colocalizes with cofilin- 1 to dynamic regions of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Analysis of <b>CAP</b> 1 knockdown <b>cells</b> demonstrated that this protein promotes rapid actin filament depolymerization and is important for cell morphology, migration, and endocytosis. Interestingly, depletion of CAP 1 leads to an accumulation of cofilin- 1 into abnormal cytoplasmic aggregates and to similar cytoskeletal defects to those seen in cofilin- 1 knockdown <b>cells,</b> demonstrating that <b>CAP</b> 1 is required for proper subcellular localization and function of ADF/cofilin. Together, these data provide the first direct in vivo evidence that CAP promotes rapid actin dynamics in conjunction with ADF/cofilin and is required for several central cellular processes in mammals...|$|R
40|$|International audienceVarroa {{destructor}} is a parasitic mite of A. mellifera. Female mites reproduce on both drone {{and worker}} brood; {{but they are}} found 5 - 9  times more often on drone brood. We examined larval tending by brood nest bees to determine if this behavior could provide an explanation for these differences. We observed workers tending worker and drone larvae in three observation colonies commencing 60 h prior to the completion of <b>cell</b> <b>capping,</b> an interval that includes the susceptible periods of both types of brood. Workers invested 2. 78 times more time tending drone larvae than worker larvae, a difference due primarily to {{a greater number of}} tending acts directed towards drone brood.
