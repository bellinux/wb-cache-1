5|$|Hurricane Pauline lightly {{affected}} {{the state of}} Chiapas, but severely affected Oaxaca and Guerrero, two of the poorest regions of Mexico. The area most impacted was the region in and around Acapulco. Throughout the country, Hurricane Pauline resulted in $447.8million in damage (1997USD). A report issued by the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs reported 137deaths three days after Hurricane Pauline. Four days {{after the passage of}} the hurricane, a Reuters news report stated there were 173dead with about 200missing, while the government of Mexico issued a statement reporting 149deaths. Ultimately, media reports indicated a death toll of at least 230people, and the Mexican Red Cross estimated 400dead and at least 1,900missing. The <b>Church</b> <b>World</b> <b>Service</b> estimated at least 500people were killed. Relief Web suggests that 217 fatalities were reported and 600,000 people were impacted. Approximately 300,000 people were left homeless due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic {{community}} in Afghanistan is mainly made of foreigners, especially aid workers, and no Afghans {{are known to}} be currently part of the Church, mainly due to great social and legal pressure not to convert to non-Islamic religions. Some Afghans have converted while overseas, but they keep it secret when they return. Two Christian groups, <b>Church</b> <b>World</b> <b>Service</b> and Norwegian Church Aid, were accused of proselytizing while doing aid work in Afghanistan, which they denied, and 1,000 Afghans protested in Mazar-i-Sharif and burned the pope in effigy. Despite this, the community has grown from only a few sisters to a full Sunday Mass of around 100. Church attendance dipped in 2012 due to security concerns and less emphasis on religion among the foreigners in Afghanistan in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Despite growing {{protests and}} the {{increasing}} death toll, President Zedillo did not initially request for international aid, believing that the country had the necessary resources, although by October15 he changed his position. The office of Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan issued a statement of condolences to those affected by the tragedy. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) donated $100,000 on October13. The European Commission approved €1million (1999euros) in aid to be distributed through the German and Spanish Red Cross agencies. The <b>Church</b> <b>World</b> <b>Service</b> launched an appeal on October8 to raise funds, and provided $47,000 worth of blankets and bedding. The Catholic Relief Services pledged $100,000 for flood victims in Mexico. Thousands of residents in Mexico donated 500tons of food, along with water, clothes, and medicine to the Mexican Red Cross. After additional flooding in Tabasco, the Mexican Red Cross sent 254metric tonnes of food, water, medicine, and clothing to the state. The American Red Cross donated about $100,000 to its Mexican counterpart. Direct Relief International sent two loads of medicine and blankets to Oaxaca. Adventist Development and Relief Agency provided food for about 25,000people.|$|E

5|$|Further funds {{came from}} the United States Agency for International Development, which offered US$25,000 by mid-January. The French Polynesian {{assembly}} in Tahiti also provided US$770,000 worth of relief supplies and aid. The main industry of Tonga, tourism, was devastated by the storm as no tourists were allowed {{to travel to the}} region for at least two weeks after Waka's passage. The Government of Tonga requested a total of US$39.2million in international aid, most of which was dedicated to rehabilitation of infrastructure. Medical supplies and personnel were later deployed by the World Health Organization. In early March, a relief fund based on donations was set up by the United Methodist Committee on Relief to provide US$210,000 for 30 families impacted by the storm. About 180 people were given assistance in rebuilding their homes by the <b>Church</b> <b>World</b> <b>Service</b> later that month. As food shortages became severe in April, emergency supplies were sent to the outlying Niuas islands of Tonga. In May, US$5.85million was approved for emergency funds by the World Bank to assist in infrastructural rehabilitation.|$|E

Upon the Soviet {{occupation}} of Latvia in 1940, her parents and older sister Inta fled to Germany, survived the refugee-despising Nazi regime, and then lived in a United Nations supported Latvian refugee camp in Esslingen am Neckar, Baden-Württemberg.
