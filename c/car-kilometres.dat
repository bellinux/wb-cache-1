40|$|In {{part one}} of this report, general {{transport}} and transport-flow measures are described. By using other modes of transport than road-vehicles, {{it is possible to}} save energy. An advanced park-and-ride system can lead to a 27 % reduction in energy use per passengerkilometre; in 2040 at most 10 % {{of the total number of}} passengerkilometres can be replaced by public transport. For freight transport intermodal goods transport can lead to energy-gains of about 50 %, and here also a maximum of 10 % of the total amount of tonkilometres can be replaced. Within the (public) collective transportation systems, gains in energy-efficiency of about 50 % (per passengerkilometre) can be achieved by introducing light-rail systems. By using traffic information and contral systems, the number of <b>car-kilometres</b> can, theoreticalIy, be reduced by some 20 %. In part two, electric vehicles are discussed. By using more advanced batteries or, in future fuel-cells, the energy-efficiency of electric vehicles can be improved by 43 % (advanced batteries) or 25 % (fuel-cells). Probably battery-powered vehicles will not offer the same performance as vehicles with an internal combustion engine, but fuel-cell powered electric vehicles possibly will. Part of the gains can be obtained by better batteries (higher loading/unloading efficiency), but another part of the gains can be achieved by improvements on electric motors, transmission systems and motor and battery management systems. Disadvantages of electric vehicles are the low chain energy-efficiency (power plants) and the battery or fuel-cell costs: only in the more distant future prices of electric vehicles will be comparable with prices of internal combustion engine vehicles. In part three, hybrid electric/internal combustion vehicles are discussed. These vehicles offer a performance comparable with internal combustion engine vehicles. However, the energy-benefits are not as big as with full electric vehicles. In this third part regenerative braking systems are discussed too. By using these systems, in passenger cars some 5 % of the brake -energy losses can be "recuperated"; in busses these gains mount to about 30 %. Energy can temporarily be stored as hydraulic pressure, as kinetic energy (in flywheels) or as electric energy maybe in so called super-capacitors. With advanced automatic transmission systems vehicles can be made even more energy-efficient. The transmission systems themselves are somewhat less efficient than manual gearing systems, but with the advanced transmission systems, engines can be used in the most efficient way. The net efficiency gains are about 5 %. In part four, improvements on internal combustion engines are discussed. By using multivalve technology, ceramic elements, multipoint injection and turbo (intercooling) systems, energy-efficiency gains of 23 % (otto-engines) to 30 % (diesel-engines) seem to be possible at relatively low costs. As an alternative to steady-state internal combustion engines in, for example, hybrid vehicles, free piston engines can be used : these engines are expected to be cheaper, lighter in weight and more energy-efficient (33 % gain). Furthermore, these engines can be used in so called 'mobile equipment'. In this fourth part, improvements in vehicle construction are discussed too. By reducing weight, rolling resistance (partly by reducing the weight, partly by other tires) and airdrag, efficiency gains of about 26 % (compared to 1994 vehicles) seem to be possible and this at relatively low extra costs.
