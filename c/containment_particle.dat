40|$|Background: Nano-specific {{inhalation}} exposure models {{could potentially}} be effective tools to assess and control worker exposure to nano-objects, and their aggregates and agglomerates (NOAA). However, {{due to the lack}} of reliable and consistent collected NOAA exposure data, the scientific basis for validation of the existing NOAA exposure models is missing or limited. The main objective of this study was to gain more insight into the effect of various determinants underlying the potential on the concentration of airborne NOAA close to the source with the purpose of providing a scientific basis for existing and future exposure inhalation models. Method: Four experimental studies were conducted to investigate the effect of 11 determinants of emission on the concentration airborne NOAA close to the source during dumping of ~ 100 % nanopowders. Determinants under study were: nanomaterial, particle size, dump mass, height, rate, ventilation rate, mixing speed, <b>containment,</b> <b>particle</b> surface coating, moisture content of the powder, and receiving surface. The experiments were conducted in an experimental room (19. 5 m 3) with well-controlled environmental and ventilation conditions. Particle number concentration and size distribution were measured using real-time measurement devices. Results: Dumping of nanopowders resulted in a higher number concentration and larger particles than dumping their reference microsized powder (P < 0. 05). Statistically significant more and larger particles were also found during dumping of SiO 2 nanopowder compared to TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 nanopowders. Particle surface coating did not affect the number concentration but on average larger particles were found during dumping of coated nanopowders. An increase of the powder's moisture content resulted in less and smaller particles in the air. Furthermore, the results indicate that particle number concentration increases with increasing dump height, rate, and mass and decreases when ventilation is turned on. Discussion: These results give an indication of the direction and magnitude of the effect of the studied determinants on concentrations close to the source and provide a scientific basis for (further) development of existing and future NOAA inhalation exposure models...|$|E

Without <b>containment,</b> liquids and <b>particles</b> involved in experiments on board the Space Station would float about the cabin. This could cause damage to equipment or harm the crew.|$|R
5|$|Prion {{aggregates}} {{are extremely}} stable and accumulate in infected tissue, causing tissue damage and cell death. This structural stability means that prions {{are resistant to}} denaturation by chemical and physical agents, making disposal and <b>containment</b> of these <b>particles</b> difficult. Prion structure varies slightly between species, but nonetheless prion replication is subject to epimutation and natural selection just like other forms of replication.|$|R
40|$|The dynamic moition of the ions {{contained}} in the trapped (199) Hg+ frequency standard contributes to {{the stability of the}} standard. In order to study these dynamics, a macroscopic analog of the (199) Hg+ trap is constructed. <b>Containment</b> of micron-sized <b>particles</b> in this trap allows direct visual observation of the particles' motion. Influenced by the confining fields and their own Coulomb repulsion, the particles can form stable arrays...|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} or remediation of contaminants at some sites is neither technically nor economically feasible. Containment or stabilization of these subsurface contaminants, therefore, {{may be the}} only viable alternative for the protection of human and ecological health. The overall goal of the proposed research is the development of reactive membrane barriers which dramatically enhance <b>containment.</b> Reactive <b>particles</b> in these barriers serve to either immobilize or transform contaminants within the membrane, and thus increase the time to breakthrough. These membranes are a powerful, novel, and versatile technique to contain and stabilize subsurface contaminants. This work focuses on reactive membrane barriers containing either zero-valent iron (Fe 0) particles (which can reduce metals and chlorinated solvents) or crystalline silicotitanate (CST, a selective ion exchanger of cesium and strontium) particles...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, optical micromachines {{based on}} forces exerted by {{strongly}} focused beams of light {{have started to}} provide unprecedented access to nonintrusive measurement and manipulation of matter on submicron length scales. However, the sharpness of the present optical tweezers is restricted by the spatial gradients of light attainable with diffraction-limited optics. Here, we demonstrate a technique for optical trapping of single particles in a fluid, {{which is based on}} the intense near-field gradients around small apertures in a metal film. Our scheme should be able to trap smaller particles with a fraction of the laser intensity required by conventional optical tweezers. Detailed simulations of the electromagnetic fields near apertures and the resulting forces they can produce are described. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment in which the trapping of latex beads is demonstrated by following the time evolution of their fluorescence. Our scheme allows <b>containment</b> of <b>particles</b> in free solution in nanometer sized “beakers ” opening the way for research on single nanoparticle chemistry, microrheology in confined environments, and ultrahigh sensitivity sensors...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{report on the}} identification and optimization of independent variables which affect the ion density and confinement time in a bumpy torus plasma is presented. The independent variables include the polarity, position, and number of the midplane electrode rings, the method of gas injection, and the polarity and strength of a weak vertical magnetic field. Some characteristic data taken under condition {{when most of the}} independent variables were optimized are presented. The highest value of the electron number density on the plasma axis is 3. 2 x 10 to the 12 th power/cc, the highest ion heating efficiency is 47 percent, and the longest <b>particle</b> <b>containment</b> time is 2. 0 milliseconds...|$|R
50|$|In {{particle}} physics, a calorimeter is {{an experimental}} apparatus that measures {{the energy of}} particles. Most particles enter the calorimeter and initiate a particle shower and the particles' energy is deposited in the calorimeter, collected, and measured. The energy may be measured in its entirety, requiring total <b>containment</b> of the <b>particle</b> shower, {{or it may be}} sampled. Typically, calorimeters are segmented transversely to provide information about the direction of the particle or particles, as well as the energy deposited, and longitudinal segmentation can provide information about the identity of the particle based on the shape of the shower as it develops. Calorimetry design is an active area of research in particle physics.|$|R
40|$|Measurements of the {{composition}} of the cosmic rays at high energies, and of the energy spectra of the individual components provide the basis for the understanding of the sources, of the acceleration mechanism, and of the galactic <b>containment</b> of these <b>particles.</b> A brief review of the presently available information and a recent measurement performed on the Space Shuttle to substantially extend the range of energies in which the elemental composition is known are described. Results, and recent data on the electron component of cosmic rays are discussed and summarized. The body of data now available contains several features that are difficult to explain within current models of galactic shock acceleration and 'leakly box' containment. The need for further measurements is emphasized and possible opportunities for future work are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{behavior}} of ELMs in NBI-heated H-mode plasmas in NSTX. It is observed that the size of Type I ELMs, characterized by the change in plasma energy, decreases with increasing density, as observed at conventional aspect ratio. It is also observed that the Type I ELM size decreases as the plasma equilibrium is shifted from a symmetric double-null toward a lower single-null configuration. Type III ELMs have also been observed in NSTX, as well as a high-performance regime with small ELMs which we designate Type V. These Type V ELMs are consistent with high bootstrap current operation and density approaching Greenwald scaling. The Type V ELMs are characterized by an intermittent n= 1 MHD mode rotating counter to the plasma current. Without active pumping, the density rises continuously through the Type V phase. However, efficient in-vessel pumping should allow density control, based on <b>particle</b> <b>containment</b> time estimates...|$|R
40|$|A {{toroidal}} plasma {{is confined}} and heated by the simultaneous application of strong d. c. magnetic fields and electric fields. Strong radial electric fields (about 1 kilovolt per centimeter) are imposed by biasing the plasma {{with up to}} 12 negative electrode rings which surround its minor circumference. The plasma containment {{is consistent with a}} balance of two processes: a radial infusion of ions in those sectors not containing electrode rings, resulting from the radially inward electric fields; and ion losses to the electrode rings, each of which acts as a sink and draws ions out the plasma {{in the manner of a}} Langmuir probe in the ion saturation regime. The highest density on axis which has been observed so far in this steady-state plasma is 6. 2 x 10 to the 12 th power particles per cubic centimeter, for which the <b>particle</b> <b>containment</b> time is 2. 5 milliseconds. The deuterium ion kinetic temperature for these conditions was in the range of 360 to 520 eV...|$|R
40|$|The {{toroidal}} ring of plasma {{contained in}} the NASA Lewis Bumpy Torus facility may be biased to positive or negative potentials approaching 50 kV by applying dc voltages of the respective polarity to 12 or fewer midplane electrode rings. The radial electric fields, which are responsible for raising the ions to high energies by E x B/B-squared drift, then point out of or into the plasma. A preliminary report is given on the identification and optimization of independent variables which affect the ion density and confinement time in the Bumpy Torus plasma. The independent variables include the polarity, position, and number of the midplane electrode rings, the method of gas injection, and the polarity and strength of a weak vertical magnetic field. Some characteristic data taken under conditions {{where most of the}} independent variables were optimized are presented. The highest value of the electron number density on the plasma axis is 3. 2 trillion per cu cm, the highest ion heating efficiency is 47 %, and the longest <b>particle</b> <b>containment</b> time is 2. 0 msec...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree of}} {{toroidal}} symmetry of the plasma, {{the number of}} midplane electrode rings, the configuration of electrode rings, {{and the location of}} the diagnostic instruments with respect to the electrode rings used to generate the plasma are discussed. Impurities were deliberately introduced into the plasma, and the effects of the impurity fraction on ion kinetic temperature and electron number density were observed. It is concluded that, if necessary precautions are taken, the plasma communicates extremely well along the magnetic field lines and displays a high degree of symmetry from sector to sector {{for a wide range of}} electrode ring configurations and operating conditions. Finally, some characteristic data taken under nonoptimized conditions are presented, which include the highest electron number density and the longest <b>particle</b> <b>containment</b> time (1. 9 msec) observed. Also, evidence from a paired comparison test is presented which shows that the electric field acting along the minor radius of the toroidal plasma improves the plasma density and the calculated containment time more than an order of magnitude if the electric field points inward, relative to the values observed when it points (and pushes ions) radially outward...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this pilot study were to (a) develop and test an instrument and methodology to assess subjectively cleanroom garment comfortand (b) evaluate comfort and <b>particle</b> <b>containment</b> of a traditionalfabric hood and complete coverage hood with remote breathing device. A female subject wearing coveralls, boots, gloves, and either a fabric or complete coverage hood assembly used a subjective comfort instrument to identify garment wearing sensations, thermal comfort, and perceived physical state. The subject {{was able to}} distinguish between the level of thermal comfort of the two hoods with the complete coverage hood being more comfortable than the fabric hood. She identified heaviness as a sensation that differed between the two hoods; the complete coverage hood was felt to be heavier than the fabric hood. The subject was less likely to feel energetic, interested, and attentive while wearing the complete coverage hood Early evidence indicates that a human perception approach can provide useful information on cleanroom garment comfort. Recommendations are made for refinement of the comfort assessment methodology. The complete coverage hood was more effective than the traditional fabric hood in containing particle contamination from face and head. Cleanroom production personnel and the protective garments they wear are considered to be a major source of particle contamination in the microelectronics industry...|$|R
40|$|A novel type of rotor-stator {{spinning}} disk {{device is}} proposed {{which allows for}} the entrapment of solid particles solely by hydrodynamic means. In this new configuration, the solid rotating disk is replaced with two conjoined rotors with a variable gap spacing. Liquid is fed through the top stator and can flow out again through the rotor-rotor interior and the hollow rotation axis. Moreover, the volume between the two rotors is optionally filled with a highly porous reticulated carbon foam. It was found that <b>particle</b> <b>containment</b> was strongly improved {{by the presence of}} this reticulated foam as it hinders the buildup of centripetal boundary layer flow near the disks in the interior of the rotor-rotor assembly. These centripetal boundary layers drag along particles resulting in a loss of containment. Experiments utilizing glass beads showed that particles with a diameter down to 17. 8 µm can be completely entrapped when a carbon foam is placed between the two conjoined disks at rotor speeds up to the maximum investigated value of 178 rad s- 1. Additionally, the rotor-rotor gap did not {{have an effect on the}} particle entrapment level when the reticulated carbon foam was omitted and can be ascribed to the build-up of boundary layers, which is independent of rotor-rotor distance. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineer...|$|R
40|$|Adenovirus (Ad) {{mediated}} {{expression of}} therapeutic proteins from salivary glands {{can result in}} the delivery of biologically active proteins into the circulation where they impart their physiological function. In recent years, Ad vector delivery to salivary glands (SGs) has emerged as a viable option for gene therapy. Here, we engineered a variant of human proinsulin (hProinsulin-B 10) into an Ad vector and demonstrated its ability to transduce cell lines, and express a bioactive protein that induces the phosphorylation of AKT, a key insulin signaling molecule. We also examined its expression in mice following delivery of the vector to the parotid gland (PTG), the submandibular gland (SMG) or to the liver via the tail vein and assessed transgenic protein expression and vector containment for each delivery method. In all cases, hProinsulin-B 10 was expressed and secreted into the circulation. Lower levels of circulating hProinsulin-B 10 were obtained from the PTG while higher levels were obtained from the tail vein and the SMG; however, vector <b>particle</b> <b>containment</b> was best when delivered to the SMG. Expression of hProinsulin-B 10 in the SMG of chemically induced diabetic mice prevented excessive hyperglycemia observed in untreated mice. These results demonstrate that hProinsulin-B 10 can be expressed and secreted into the circulation from SGs and can function physiologically in vivo. The ability to remediate a diabetic phenotype in a model of type 1 diabete...|$|R
5000|$|Filtered oxygen masks {{have the}} ability to prevent exhaled, {{potentially}} infectious particles from being released into the surrounding environment. These masks are normally of a closed design such that leaks are minimized and breathing of room air is controlled through a series of one-way valves. Filtration of exhaled breaths is accomplished either by placing a filter on the exhalation port, or through an integral filter {{that is part of the}} mask itself. These masks first became popular in the Toronto (Canada) healthcare community during the 2003 SARS Crisis. SARS was identified as being respiratory based and it was determined that conventional oxygen therapy devices were not designed for the <b>containment</b> of exhaled <b>particles.</b> [...] Common practices of having suspected patients wear a surgical mask was confounded by the use of standard oxygen therapy equipment. In 2003, the HiOx80 oxygen mask was released for sale. The HiOx80 mask is a closed design mask that allows a filter to be placed on the exhalation port. Several new designs have emerged in the global healthcare community for the containment and filtration of potentially infectious particles. Other designs include the ISO- oxygen mask, the Flo2Max oxygen mask, and the O-Mask. The use of oxygen masks that are capable of filtering exhaled particles is gradually becoming a recommended practice for pandemic preparation in many jurisdictions.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} closed access, it was {{published}} in the Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry [© Royal Society of Chemistry]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] technical note describes the development of Laser Ablation of a Sample In Liquid (LASIL), a technique where the ablation occurs at a solid sample surface submerged in a liquid. LASIL can be performed in a 25 µl isolated, freestanding droplet that acts as a micro-laser cavity, to produce a suspended particulate that can be analysed either directly, or following in-droplet chemistry, by calibration against aqueous standards. The technique is robust and easy to implement being carried out in air, offline to the detection apparatus. The analytical characteristics of LASIL are its ease of quantification, <b>containment</b> of <b>particles,</b> the ease of generating suspended solids in solution from insoluble materials and the control over dissolution and dilution to generate measurable concentrations. NIST 611 (trace elements in glass) was employed as a test sample as it is a commonly used reference material in conventional Laser Ablation (LA) studies. Droplet LASIL allowed the quantification of trace elements in NIST 611 and also investigation of the particle sizes and shapes generated by the ablation process. Particle sizes were found to vary with laser fluence, with higher fluences producing a wider particle size distribution with greater variation in shape. The types of particles found were: jagged particles of 1 – 2 µm in diameter most probably created by micro-jet impingement, spherical nanometre sized particles from vapour condensation and melt ejection, and thin, string-like particles from particle agglomeration or liquid jet fragmentation. At lower fluences the particle morphology tended towards spherical shapes and formed agglomerates. At this small particle size (below 250 nm), Brownian motion ensures a very slow settling rate in the liquid medium yielding solutions that are stable for analysis over several days. Alternatively, as demonstrated here, post-ablation chemistry can be carried out in the droplet, e. g. acid dissolution, or clean up using micro-extraction techniques. The liquid droplet was analysed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with calibration against aqueous standards. The ablation yield from the sample was normalised using the found versus known concentration of uranium in the sample and ratioing measured elemental concentrations to this factor. LASIL on a sample immersed in liquid facilitated the study of the effect of the solution composition on the LASIL process...|$|R
2500|$|The {{higher the}} energy of the gamma rays, the thicker the {{shielding}} made from the same shielding material is required. Materials for shielding gamma rays are typically measured by the thickness required to reduce the intensity of the gamma rays by one half (the half value layer or HVL). For example, gamma rays that require [...] (0.4″) of lead to reduce their intensity by 50% will also have their intensity reduced in half by [...] of granite rock, 6cm (2½″) of concrete, or 9cm (3½″) of packed soil. However, the mass of this much concrete or soil is only 20–30% greater than that of lead with the same absorption capability. Depleted uranium is used for shielding in portable gamma ray sources, but here the savings in weight over lead are larger, as portable sources' shape resembles a sphere to some extent, and the volume of a sphere is dependent on the cube of the radius; so a source with its radius cut in half will have its volume reduced by a factor of eight, which will more than compensate uranium's greater density (as well as reducing bulk). In a nuclear power plant, shielding can be provided by steel and concrete in the pressure and <b>particle</b> <b>containment</b> vessel, while water provides a radiation shielding of fuel rods during storage or transport into the reactor core. The loss of water or removal of a [...] "hot" [...] fuel assembly into the air would result in much higher radiation levels than when kept under water.|$|R
