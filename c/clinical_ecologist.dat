40|$|In July 1992 Dr Keith Mumby, a <b>clinical</b> <b>ecologist,</b> {{appeared}} before the professional conduct committee of the General Medical Council on five charges {{to do with his}} practice of clinical ecology. He was found guilty of two of the charges [...] touting for publicity and failing to give a patient adequate medical attention [...] and admonished. The GMC failed, however, {{to address the issue of}} the nature of Mumby's treatments [...] clinical ecology itself. This is based on the idea that some patients are unusually susceptible to their environment, the diagnosis and treatment are based on an unstandardised provocation-neutralisation test. A variety of medical bodies have failed to find scientific foundation for the technique. The GMC's policy on advertising services to patients is inconsistent, and in this case it has shown a regrettable reluctance to deal with the issue of treatments that are not scientifically validated...|$|E

5000|$|The Society for Clinical Ecology {{was founded}} in 1965, and {{inspired}} by the ideas of Theron Randolph. <b>Clinical</b> <b>Ecologists</b> claimed that exposure to low levels of certain chemical agents harm susceptible people, causing multiple chemical sensitivity and other disorders.|$|R
5000|$|Clinical ecology was {{the name}} given by proponents in the 1960s to a claim that {{exposure}} to low levels of certain chemical agents harm susceptible people, causing multiple chemical sensitivity and other disorders. <b>Clinical</b> <b>ecologists</b> are people that support and promote this offshoot of conventional medicine. [...] They often have a background {{in the field of}} allergy or otorhinolaryngology, and the theoretical approach is derived in part from classic concepts of allergic responses, first articulated by Theron Randolph. <b>Clinical</b> <b>ecologists</b> support a cause-and-effect relationships for non-specific symptoms reported by some people after low dose exposure to chemical, biologic, or physical agents. This pattern of low dose reaction is not generally accepted by toxicologists. Although some of the mainstream medical community continue to reject these claims, the concept is gaining in recognition under the modern and more clearly articulated classification of environmental medicine.|$|R
40|$|In 1981 the California Medical Association (CMA) {{adopted the}} {{position}} that clinical ecology does not constitute a valid medical discipline and that scientific and clinical {{evidence to support the}} diagnosis of “environmental illness” and “cerebral allergy” or the concept of massive environmental allergy is lacking. As a result of requests from <b>clinical</b> <b>ecologists</b> for an opportunity to present to CMA evidence justifying their diagnostic and treatment methods, the chair of the CMA Scientific Board, Allen W. Mathies, Jr, MD, appointed a task force in 1984 to review clinical ecology. The task force conducted an extensive literature review and held a hearing...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{hypersensitivity}} {{disorder is}} reputed to cause multiple allergic responses in susceptible people after exposure to common substances in the environment. The seriously afflicted, who believe {{themselves to be}} unable {{to live in the}} modern world, often become severely disabled. After a careful search of the literature, I am unable to find any scientific evidence for the validity of the theories, testing methods, or treatments given to these patients by <b>clinical</b> <b>ecologists.</b> This paper critically examines the concepts of environmental hypersensitivity and reviews scientific studies on this subject. It concludes that these patients are a heterogeneous group, and that many of them suffer from treatable psychiatric disorders. Guidelines are given for their management...|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of GMO {{food and the}} increased use of herbicides on food crops has resulted in an increased interest in the area of environmental sensitivities. A polarized debate has grown between supporters of the new agri-technology who characterize themselves as rational scientists and opponents as ignorant alarmists. On the other hand, the opponents characterize the supporters as dogmatic industry shills and themselves as critical thinkers and environmentalists. Both groups claim to be the majority opinion, although the only consensus that has weight is within the government organizations that rule on safety. At issue is the non-industry science that characterizes herbicides and the genetically engineered pesticides of GMO crops as endocrine disruptors. That disruption also triggers autoimmune system responses consistent with those observed by <b>clinical</b> <b>ecologists.</b>|$|R
40|$|Twentieth-century disease”, or “total allergy syndrome”, is a {{condition}} attributed to hypersensitivity to the environment that may sometimes be seen as so serious that the patient is incapable {{of living in the}} modern world. Although the popular media frequently carry stories about it, there is little scientific literature. It is diagnosed by <b>clinical</b> <b>ecologists,</b> who maintain, among other theories, that susceptible individuals experience an overload in assaults by artificial materials in the environment. The patients usually have multiple ill defined symptoms for which no organic cause can be found, but they vigorously resist psychiatric referral, as they attribute their symptoms to allergy. A group of 18 patients who were purportedly suffering from 20 th-century disease were referred to a university psychiatric consultation liaison service. They virtually all had a long history of visits to physicians, and their symptoms were characteristic of several well known psychiatric disorders. The case histories and management of three of them are presented. Although this group of patients may have been atypical in that they had more severe psychologic symptoms, the experience indicates that a psychiatric diagnosis ought to be considered. The symptoms of 20 th-century disease have much in common with other conditions known to physicians for centuries...|$|R
40|$|Objectives It is {{important}} for designers to become knowledgeable on multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) {{as it relates to}} indoor air quality (IAQ). It is also important to design spaces and specify materials for the built environment that promotes good IAQ. Theoretical/conceptual framework MCS is a condition in which a person reports sensitivity or intolerance to a number of chemicals and other irritants at very low concentrations (EPA, 2003). Within the medical community, MCS has been controversial and still is today regarding its name, definition, diagnosis, and treatment. Some physicians consider MCS a psychological illness or phenomenon, while others physicians and <b>clinical</b> <b>ecologists</b> treat patients with MCS. However, research indicates that many individuals have become ill from chemicals emitted from materials within interior spaces. Summary of Analysis A consensus on MCS within the medical community is essential. The relevance of MCS for the design community is that many materials used in building construction, interior finishes and furnishings, and products for installations contain chemicals that may trigger MCS. Therefore, it is essential that designers specify safe, healthy materials. Conclusions Since many designers (architects and interior designs) are working to improve IAQ, they could take the initiative for change by working collaboratively on research with the medical community and individuals with MCS; by educating other designer about appropriate product specifications; and by becoming a legislative advocate...|$|R
