5|$|After McCoy {{told them}} they were the Miami Showband, Thomas Crozier (who had a notebook) asked the band members for their names and addresses, while the others bantered with them about {{the success of their}} {{performance}} that night. As Crozier took down the information, a <b>car</b> <b>pulled</b> up and another uniformed man appeared on the scene. He wore a uniform and beret noticeably different from the others. He spoke with an educated English accent and immediately took charge, ordering a man who appeared to have been the leader of the patrol, to tell Crozier to obtain their names and dates of birth instead of addresses.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{maintained}} his start line advantage and withstood Häkkinen's attempts to pass him {{going into the}} first corner. Further around the lap, a collision involving four cars prompted the deployment of the safety car and a fire marshal Paolo Gislimberti {{was struck by a}} flying wheel. When the safety <b>car</b> <b>pulled</b> into the pit lane on lap eleven, Michael Schumacher began to immediately pull clear from Häkkinen and kept the lead until his pit stop on the 39th lap. When Häkkinen made his own pit stop three laps later, Michael Schumacher regained the lead which he held to clinch his sixth victory of the 2000 season; Häkkinen finished almost four seconds behind.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher, the {{eventual}} Drivers' Champion, led the Championship {{going into the}} race and started from fourth position alongside Barrichello. At the first corner BAR's Ricardo Zonta ran into the rear of Michael Schumacher. The incident forced the German to retire and caused a safety car deployment. After the safety <b>car</b> <b>pulled</b> in after one lap Häkkinen and Coulthard extended a comfortable lead {{over the rest of}} the field. When Häkkinen made his pit stop on lap 38, he rejoined behind Coulthard, but ahead of Barrichello. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 41, allowing Häkkinen back into the lead which he held to clinch his second victory of the 2000 season.|$|E

5|$|The race began {{behind the}} safety car but was stopped after three laps {{because of a}} large amount of {{standing}} water on the circuit. After a 45-minute delay, the race was restarted and the safety <b>car</b> <b>pulled</b> into the pit lane after thirteen laps. Pole sitter Sebastian Vettel maintained his lead going into the first corner. A second safety car deployment caused by the collision of Mark Webber and Nico Rosberg on lap nineteen closed up the field but Vettel retained the lead. Alonso maintained second position until a botched pit stop during a third safety-car period caused him to drop to third. At the restart on lap thirty-five, Hamilton ran wide at the first corner, allowing Alonso back into second place. Vettel's engine failed eleven laps later, allowing Alonso to move into the lead, which he maintained to win the race.|$|E
5|$|The safety <b>car</b> <b>pulled</b> {{into the}} pit-lane {{at the end}} of the secondlap. Vettel {{retained}} his lead into the firstcorner, followed by Kovalainen, Webber, Rosberg and Massa. Kubica passed Heidfeld at the first chicane; Glock passed Alonso later in the lap. Vettel immediately opened a lead of twoseconds over Kovalainen; the McLaren driver experienced visibility problems as a result of the spray off the back of the Toro Rosso. Alonso regained seventh from Glock when he passed him at the first chicane on lapfour as the track began to dry. Räikkönen and Hamilton passed Coulthard on the same lap to take 12th and 13thpositions, respectively. The next lap, Hamilton attempted to pass Räikkönen at the third corner, but overshot, cutting the chicane. Emerging ahead of the Ferrari, he gave the place back, returning the advantage and avoiding a penalty. Glock spun on lapseven, losing oneplace to Kubica.|$|E
5|$|The safety <b>car</b> <b>pulled</b> off {{the track}} {{at the end of}} lap twenty-three and the race resumed with Vettel leading from Alonso and Hamilton. Vettel began to {{gradually}} pull clear {{from the rest of the}} field. On the twenty-fourth lap while battling with Senna for twenty-first place, Trulli collided with Senna after attempting a passing manoeuvre around the inside; Trulli's front wing was knocked off. Trulli drove to his garage for repairs. Button, who was in fifth, started to place Massa under pressure on the same lap. Kobayashi passed Yamamoto on lap twenty-six but ran wide and fell down the order, while Trulli rejoined the race. Di Grassi lost control of his car at turn fourteen after trying to pass Yamamoto on lap twenty-seven; he made light contact with the wall which caused him to retire.|$|E

5|$|On lap 25, a man {{appeared}} {{beside the}} barriers of the circuit on the straight heading towards turn 2. He {{ran across the}} track to avoid being caught by marshals. The incident prompted the deployment of the safety car. Teams immediately brought their drivers into the pit lane {{to take advantage of}} the scenario with Trulli and de la Rosa the first to make pit stops. McLaren called in Häkkinen to the pit lane on lap 27 and Coulthard remained out on worn tyres. The Scot pitted on the following lap and emerged in sixth place. On the same lap, the man was caught and escorted off the circuit. Racing resumed on lap 29 when the safety <b>car</b> <b>pulled</b> into the pit lane. Trulli immediately came under pressure from Barrichello and withstood the Brazilian's attempts to pass him. Ralf Schumacher spun at turn 3 on lap thirty and Verstappen was forced wide in avoidance. Later on Alesi collided with Diniz and struck the barriers, having lost his car's two left wheels. The safety car was once again deployed as carbon fibre was scattered across the grass.|$|E
5|$|Liuzzi {{pulled over}} {{to the inside of}} the circuit on the third lap, at turn ten, with left-rear {{suspension}} damage resulting from contact with the wall. His retirement triggered the deployment of the safety car as marshals were required to push his car away from the track. Webber was the only top running driver to pit for the medium compound tyres during the safety car period on lap four. Red Bull had told Webber to enter the pit lane, assuring him that it was the right decision, though he questioned the move. Several drivers towards the rear also chose to pit. Racing resumed at the end of lap five when the safety <b>car</b> <b>pulled</b> into the pit lane. Webber immediately pushed hard and passed Glock for tenth position and a line of cars began to form behind Glock. Alonso began to pull away from Vettel as he set consecutive fastest laps. Webber passed Kobayashi at turn five to move into ninth on lap seven, and withstood an attempt to Kobayashi to reclaim ninth heading into turn seven. Hülkenberg and Petrov's wheels made contact and both drivers went off the circuit on the same lap; Hülkenberg managed to move ahead of Petrov with Massa taking advantage to pass Petrov. Webber caught Schumacher on lap 11 and passed the latter on the same lap at turn five after Schumacher ran wide. Vettel was told by his team to cool his brakes on the same lap as Alonso continued to extend his lead. Sutil got ahead of Glock for eleventh place three laps later and started to pull away from the queue behind Glock. Hülkenberg ran wide at turn seven on the same lap but did not lose any positions. Hülkenberg passed Glock in the first sector of the track for twelfth on lap16.|$|E
5|$|On lap 27, Marcus Ericsson's Sauber {{came to a}} halt on track, {{bringing}} out the proper safety car. At this halfway point of the race, the order stood as: Rosberg, Hamilton, Ricciardo, Kvyat, Verstappen, as Vettel used the safety car period for a tyre change, moving him back into sixth. When the safety <b>car</b> <b>pulled</b> into pit lane at the end of lap 32, Vettel was back in fifth after Verstappen had also made a pit stop for new tyres. The German moved ahead into fourth at Kvyat's expense into turn one at the restart and went on to overtake the other Red Bull of Ricciardo some turns later. However, Ricciardo fought back to regain the place in the next corner. Vettel was able to make the move stick going into turn one on the subsequent lap. Meanwhile, Kvyat was further demoted when Verstappen moved ahead into fifth, followed by Hülkenberg. On lap 35, Verstappen overtook the second Red Bull of Ricciardo to move into fourth. When Nico Hülkenberg attempted to do the same one lap later, he and Ricciardo collided, forcing the German to retire. Ricciardo was able to continue, but was overtaken by his teammate, with Jenson Button behind in seventh place. When another virtual safety car period was declared to clear Hülkenberg's car, Rosberg decided to pit, moving him back to fourth behind Hamilton, Vettel and Verstappen. By lap 40, when the safety car period was over, Rosberg was up into third at the expense of Verstappen, while Alonso moved up several places into sixth, with teammate Button in fifth. Running on newer tyres, Rosberg was able to overtake Vettel on lap 42.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} factor crucial to LRT is the train operator. Unlike rail rapid transit, which can travel unattended under {{automatic train operation}} (ATO), safe, high-quality LRT operation relies on a human operator as a key element. The reason that the operator is so important is because the train tracks often share the streets with automobiles, other vehicles, and pedestrians. If trains were fully automated on roads, nobody would be there to stop the train if a <b>car</b> <b>pulled</b> in front of it. Light rail trains are actually very sturdily built for passenger safety, and to reduce damage from impacts with cars.|$|E

25|$|The {{conception}} of Vicki Fowler in 1985 {{was one of}} the first controversial storylines featured in EastEnders since its inception that February, as it involved the pregnancy of a schoolgirl, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). Exploiting a whodunnit angle, viewers were not initially told who was the father, and press interest in the fledgling show escalated as journalists attempted to guess. The audience finally discovered his identity in October 1985 on episode 66. Written by series co-creator/script-editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, it was considered a landmark episode in the show's history. Four possible suspects were seen leaving the Square early in the episode: Tony Carpenter (Oscar James), Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). As Michelle waited by their rendezvous point, a <b>car</b> <b>pulled</b> up and the fluffy white legs of the soap landlord's poodle Roly leapt out of a car and gave it all away: Den Watts had fathered Michelle's baby. After this storyline the programme started to appear in newspaper cartoons as it moved more and more into the public mainstream.|$|E
25|$|According to the woman, another <b>car</b> <b>pulled</b> {{over and}} tried to help Bermúdez Zacarías by telling a nearby {{security}} officer to call the police. The eyewitness then made a U-turn and followed the alleged assassins in her car. Tho two men went into hiding in an abandoned lot a few blocks away. She noticed that the lot was gated, {{and returned to the}} crime scene to see if any police officers had arrived. When the first policemen arrived, she reportedly told them that she saw two men walk into an abandoned lot. A third policemen went to inspect the lot, but came back to the murder scene after not seeing anything suspicious. The eyewitness complained to the press that the policemen were slow to act and may not have checked the abandoned lot thoroughly since she said there were several large bushes where the two men may have been hiding. A few days after her confession, the eyewitness stated that she was harassed by people who were presumably armed outside her home and in a vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial of}} Doherty {{and the other}} members of the M60 gang began in early May 1981, on charges {{including}} three counts of murder. On 10 June, Doherty and seven other prisoners, including Angelo Fusco {{and the other members}} of the IRA unit, took a prison officer hostage at gunpoint in Crumlin Road Jail. After locking the officer in a cell, the eight took other officers and visiting solicitors hostage, also locking them in cells after taking their clothing. Two of the eight wore officers' uniforms while a third wore clothing taken from a solicitor, and the group moved towards the first of three gates separating them from the outside world. They took the officer on duty at the gate hostage at gunpoint, and forced him to open the inner gate. An officer at the second gate recognised one of the prisoners and ran into an office and pressed an alarm button, and the prisoners ran through the second gate towards the outer gate. An officer at the outer gate tried to prevent the escape but was attacked by the prisoners, who escaped onto Crumlin Road. As the prisoners were moving towards the car park where two cars were waiting, an unmarked RUC <b>car</b> <b>pulled</b> up across the street outside Crumlin Road Courthouse. The RUC officers opened fire, and the prisoners returned fire before escaping in the waiting cars. Two days after the escape, Doherty was convicted in absentia and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum recommended term of thirty years.|$|E

He was taken into an anteroom, and his car was moved. Whitlam maintained that the purpose in moving Fraser's car was to ensure that the Prime Minister was not tipped off by seeing it, stating, [...] "Had I known Mr. Fraser was already there, I would not have set foot in Yarralumla." [...] Kelly doubted Whitlam would have recognised Fraser's car, which was an ordinary Ford LTD from the car pool. According to Fraser biographer Philip Ayres, [...] "A white <b>car</b> <b>pulled</b> up at the front would signify nothing in particular—it would simply be in the way".|$|E
500|$|Kobayashi {{attempted}} to pass {{around the outside}} of Schumacher on lap31 but the two made contact with Schumacher subsequently hitting a barrier. Kobayashi damaged his Sauber, losing control of his rear-end, and crashed at the exit of turn 18 after his front wing was knocked off entering the corner. Senna was slow to react and buried his Hispania nose-first into the barrier alongside Kobayashi. These incidents called for the race's second safety car period to allow removal of both cars from the circuit which were on the racing line. Klien was pushed into his garage to retire with an hydraulic problem on lap34. The safety <b>car</b> <b>pulled</b> into the pit lane {{at the end of}} lap35 and the race resumed with Alonso leading. Hamilton got a run on Webber who was caught behind di Grassi and lined up an overtaking manoeuvre on Webber, and overtook him on the Raffles Boulevard straight. Webber's front-right tyre hit Hamilton's left-rear tyre at turn seven. He escaped without significant damage, while Hamilton had a punctured tyre and pulled off the circuit to retire for the second consecutive race. However, Webber did feel vibrations on the front-end of his Red Bull. His tyre, which made contact with Hamilton's, had been pushed [...] off its normal mounting on the rim, and Button drew closer to Webber who managed to maintain a good pace. On lap37, Schumacher went into Heidfeld's rear-end and limped back to the pit lane to replace his damaged front wing creating sparks as it was dragged along the surface of the track, while Heidfeld retired after hitting a barrier. Button was urged by his McLaren mechanics on lap42 to push Webber whose tyres were older, while Vettel gradually closed the gap with Alonso. Hülkenberg, in ninth, made a mistake on lap44 which allowed Massa to momentarily take advantage, but he fought back and retained ninth position. Kubica sustained a right-rear puncture on lap46 and made a pit stop on the same lap, rejoining in 13th.|$|E
