50|$|Ultrapure {{water is}} easily {{contaminated}} by traces {{of carbon dioxide}} from the atmosphere passing through tiny leaks or diffusing through thin wall polymer tubing when sample lines are used for measurement. Carbon dioxide forms conductive carbonic acid in water. For this reason, <b>conductivity</b> <b>probes</b> are most often permanently inserted directly into the main ultrapure water system piping to provide real-time continuous monitoring of contamination. These <b>probes</b> contain both <b>conductivity</b> and temperature sensors to enable accurate compensation for the very large temperature influence on the conductivity of pure waters. <b>Conductivity</b> <b>probes</b> have an operating life of many years in pure water systems.

5000|$|Blend time, {{sometimes}} termed mixing time, is {{the time}} to achieve a predefined level of homogeneity of a tracer in a mixing vessel. Blend time is an important parameter to evaluate the mixing efficiency of mixing devices. [...] In order to make this definition valid, the tracer should be in the same physical phase (e.g. liquid) as the bulk material. [...] Blend time can be determined either with experiments or numerical modeling, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The experimental methods to determine the blend time in liquid include conductivity method and discoloration method. The conductivity method requires a <b>conductivity</b> <b>probe</b> to present in the target system, which make it an intrusive method because the existence of the probe might change the mixing efficiency of the mixing device. Discoloration method does not require any probe which makes it a non-intrusive method. However, the color detection device (sometimes the human eye) needs to be calibrated against the conductivity method. [...] Both methods are usually applied to monitor the concentration of the tracer in the most difficult to mix locations such as the area adjacent to the impeller shaft.|$|E

40|$|Of {{the energy}} {{dissipation}} {{that takes place}} in violent breaking waves, some is accounted for by work done against the buoyancy of bubbles, and some by work done in generating splashes that may rise to elevations far above the crest. In deep water the probability of encountering air in such conditions varies from almost zero at large submergences to almost unity at high elevations. Between these extremes in regular long-crested waves, there is a two dimensional continuum of time-dependent ensemble-averaged void fractions. A detailed knowledge of this distribution would represent a major contribution {{to a better understanding of}} the process of wave breaking, but largely for practical reasons, little of this information exists. Previous studies of air entrainment beneath breaking waves have made use of a variety of techniques including local <b>conductivity</b> <b>probes</b> (Cox & Shin, 2003; Hoque 2002), global <b>conductivity</b> <b>probes</b> (Lamarre & Melville, 1994), acoustic techniques and laser methods (Hwung & Jih, 1993). Many of these have shortcomings such as large measurement volumes, limited sensitivity at at least one end of the range of void fractions, or probes that are significantly intrusive. This paper describes detailed measurements made with an instrument that detects individual air/water interfaces over extremely small areas at high frequency.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of reactor systems is predicted using advanced computational codes {{in order to}} determine the safety characteristics of the system during various accidents and to determine the performance characteristics of the reactor. These codes generally utilize the two-fluid model for predictions of two-phase flows, as this model is the most accurate and detailed model which is currently practical for predicting large-scale systems. In the two-fluid model, it is important to give an accurate prediction of the interfacial area concentration due to the existence of the interfacial transfer terms. In order to achieve this goal, the interfacial area transport equation (IATE) has been developed. This research focuses on the study of the IATE in a scaled rod bundle geometry both in source and sink term modeling and experiment instrument development. ^ By using <b>conductivity</b> <b>probe</b> in a scaled stainless steel rod bundle test section, an adequate local measurement database is established ranging from bubbly flow to churn turbulent flow regime in two pressure conditions. With proper interpolation method and area averaging, an accurate model of interfacial area source and sink terms is developed and benchmarked. Result shows that in most of the flow conditions, the relative error of interfacial area prediction is less than 15 %. ^ Since previously developed <b>conductivity</b> <b>probe</b> cannot catch the droplet information, the interfacial area concentration database from churn turbulent to annular flow regime is limited. In order to solve this problem, a droplet capable <b>conductivity</b> <b>probe</b> (DCCP) is developed and benchmarked for the measurement in churn turbulent to annular flow regime. Comparing with the high speed camera and flow rate measurements, the probe can measure the droplet fraction, velocity, interfacial area concentration, Sauter mean diameter and flow rate within ± 5 % error. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 This thesis {{examines}} {{two techniques}} for measuring two-phase flow parameters in an air/water system using intrusive conductivity probes.
