Tharreau eventually charged Soult with insubordination; Soult had outright refused to go to Ney's assistance, despite specific, and direct, orders to move his division to Ney's flanks.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, {{the leading}} {{industries}} of St. Louis included brewing, flour milling, slaughtering, paper making, machining, and tobacco processing.

However, during the 1890s, manufacturing growth slowed dramatically. The Panic of 1893 and subsequent depression and the overproduction of grain made St. Louis mills <b>considerably</b> <b>less</b> productive and valuable.

50|$|DBD devices {{can be made}} in many configurations, {{typically}} planar, using parallel plates {{separated by}} a dielectric or cylindrical, using coaxial plates with a dielectric tube between them. In a common coaxial configuration, the dielectric is shaped in the same form as common fluorescent tubing.

Due to the atmospheric pressure level, such processes require high energy levels to sustain. Common dielectric materials include glass, quartz, ceramics and polymers.
