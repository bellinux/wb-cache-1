5|$|Jinnah {{rejected}} Gandhi's {{proposal and}} called for Direct Action Day, on 16 August 1946, to press Muslims to publicly gather in cities and support his proposal for partition of Indian subcontinent into a Muslim state and non-Muslim state. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the Muslim League Chief Minister of Bengal – now Bangladesh and West Bengal, gave Calcutta's police special holiday to celebrate the Direct Action Day. The Direct Action Day triggered a mass murder of Calcutta Hindus and the torching of their property, and holidaying police were missing to contain or stop the conflict. The British government did not order its army to move in to contain the violence. The violence on Direct Action Day led to retaliatory violence against Muslims across India. Thousands of Hindus and Muslims were murdered, {{and tens of thousands}} were injured in the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> in the days that followed. Gandhi visited the most riot-prone areas to appeal a stop to the massacres.|$|E

40|$|Why {{is it so}} hard {{to break}} out <b>of</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence?</b> This paper focuses on the {{challenges}} associated with breaking out <b>of</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and why futures thinking may provide a potential solution. Research suggests that people living in violence lack the ability to think about a peaceful future, or any future for that matter. Addressing this inability may hold a critical key to breaking out <b>of</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b> While there is mounting theory to support this idea, evidence based research is still lacking...|$|R

25|$|Hardboiled (or hard-boiled) {{fiction is}} a {{literary}} genre that shares {{some of its}} characters and settings with crime fiction (especially detective stories). The genre's typical protagonist is a detective who witnesses the violence of organized crime that flourished during Prohibition (1920–1933) and its aftermath, while dealing with a legal system that has become as corrupt as the organized crime itself. Rendered cynical by this <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> the detectives of hardboiled fiction are often antiheroes. Notable hardboiled detectives include Philip Marlowe, Mike Hammer, Sam Spade, Lew Archer, and The Continental Op.|$|E
25|$|Police officers, soldiers, or militiamen {{have been}} implicated {{in most of the}} hundred or so murders of journalists since {{democracy}} was restored in 1986. Employed by corrupt politicians or hired as contract killers, they usually target local radio presenters who have upset the people they are working for. The same modus operandi is nearly always used: two masked men on a motorcycle gun the journalist down as he is leaving his place of work. For a few thousand dollars, they eliminate the person who has been too outspoken. The <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> has never ended because the culture of impunity is so strong, especially on Mindanao.|$|E
25|$|In the January 1955 {{elections}} Mapai won 40 {{seats and}} the Labour Party 10, Moshe Sharett became {{prime minister of}} Israel {{at the head of}} a left-wing coalition. Between 1953 and 1956, there were intermittent clashes along all of Israel's borders as Arab terrorism and breaches of the ceasefire resulted in Israeli counter-raids. Palestinian fedayeen attacks, often organized and sponsored by the Egyptians, were made from (Egyptian occupied) Gaza. Fedayeen attacks led to a growing <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> as Israel launched reprisal attacks against Gaza. In 1954 the Uzi submachine gun first entered use by the Israel Defense Forces. In 1955 the Egyptian government began recruiting former Nazi rocket scientists for a missile program.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are four}} themes {{which can be}} {{associated}} with Kurosawa's filmmaking technique which recur from his early films to the films he made {{at the end of his}} career. These include his interest in (a) the master-disciple relationship, (b) the heroic champion, (c) the close examination of nature and human nature, and (d) the <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b> Regarding Kurosawa's reflections on the theme <b>of</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> these found a beginning with Throne of Blood (1957), and became nearly an obsession with historical <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> inexorable savage violence—what Stephen Prince calls [...] "the countertradition to the committed, heroic mode of Kurosawa's cinema" [...] which Kurosawa would sustain as a thematic interest even toward the end of his career in his last films.|$|R
25|$|After {{ten years}} of {{wandering}} and struggles, Rama arrives at Panchavati, {{on the banks of}} river Godavari. This region had numerous demons (rakshasha). One day, a demoness called Shurpanakha saw Rama, became enamored of him, and tried to seduce him. Rama refused her. Shurpanakha retaliated by threatening Sita. Lakshmana, the younger brother protective of his family, in turn retaliated by cutting off the nose and ears of Shurpanakha. The <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> escalated, ultimately reaching demon king Ravana, who was the brother of Shurpanakha. Ravana comes to Panchavati to take revenge on behalf of his family, sees Sita, gets attracted, and kidnaps Sita to his kingdom of Lanka (believed to be modern Sri Lanka).|$|E
25|$|Ristovski also {{intended}} {{the film to}} portray social conditions in post-independence Macedonia, depicting it as a society plagued by anomie, violence and corruption. He saw these conditions {{as part of a}} larger regional unease whose history included civil conflict in former Yugoslav territories. Critics have similarly interpreted the film as an allegory of these social and regional concerns. In this context, Marko's transition from victimhood to criminality embodies the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> endemic in such conditions, while his failed hopes serve as a cautionary warning against the dangers of empty idealism in such situations. One critic saw Paris' bullet in Marko's chess set (see figure on the right) as a metaphor for the threat of violence ever-present in their world.|$|E

Bono rewrote the Edge's initial lyrics, attempting to contrast the two events with Easter Sunday, but he has said that the band were too inexperienced at the time to fully realise that goal, noting that [...] "it was a song whose eloquence lay in its harmonic power rather than its verbal strength." ...|$|E

500|$|Others are {{somewhat}} less negative—Brysk, after {{noting that the}} work of the missionaries opened the area to outside intervention and led to the deterioration of the culture, says that the SIL also informed the Huaorani of their legal rights and taught them how to protect their interests from developers. Boster goes even further, suggesting that the [...] "pacification" [...] of the Huaorani was a result of [...] "active effort" [...] by the Huaorani themselves, not the result of missionary imposition. He argues that Christianity served as a way for the Huaorani to escape the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> in their community, since it provided a motivation to abstain from killing.|$|E
500|$|Before {{their first}} {{peaceful}} contact with outsiders (cowodi) in 1958, the Huaorani fiercely defended their territory. Viewing all cowodi as cannibalistic predators, they killed rubber tappers {{around the turn}} of the 20th century and Shell Oil Company employees during the 1940s, in addition to any lowland Quechua or other outsiders who encroached on their land. [...] Furthermore, they were prone to internal violence, often engaging in vengeance killing of other Huaorani. Raids were carried out in extreme anger by groups of men who attacked their victims' longhouse by night and then fled. Attempts to build truces through gifts and exchange of spouses became more frequent as their numbers decreased and the tribes fragmented, but the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> continued.|$|E
500|$|UN Women {{believe that}} {{violence}} against women [...] "is rooted in gender-based discrimination and social norms and gender stereotypes that perpetuate such violence", and advocate moving from supporting victims to prevention, through addressing root and structural causes. They recommend programmes that start early in life and are directed towards both genders to promote respect and equality, an area often overlooked in public policy. This strategy, which involves broad educational and cultural change, also involves implementing {{the recommendations of the}} 57th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (2013). To that end the 2014 UN International Day of the Girl Child was dedicated to ending the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b> In 2016, the World Health Assembly also adopted a plan of action to combat {{violence against women}}, globally.|$|E
25|$|A 'wind of violence' rapidly {{took hold}} of the country, foreboding civil war between the two communities.

500|$|For the {{upcoming}} God of War title, Barlog explained that Kratos {{had to change}} his <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> {{and learn how to}} control his rage. He said that Kratos had made many bad decisions, which led to the destruction of Olympus, and wanted to know what would happen if Kratos made a good decision. The birth of Barlog's own son influenced the idea of Kratos' character change. The canceled live-action Star Wars television series was also an influence. The bond between Kratos and his son {{is at the heart of}} the game and Barlog said [...] "This game is about Kratos teaching his son how to be a god, and his son teaching Kratos how to be human again." [...] Referencing the Marvel Comics character Hulk, Barlog said that in regards to Kratos, [...] "We've already told the story of The Hulk. We want to tell the story of Banner now." [...] Christopher Judge, best known as Teal'c from Stargate SG-1, replaces T.C. Carson as the voice of Kratos in the game; Carson had voiced Kratos since the original God of War.

There are too many problems with the concept; the nature/nurture debate {{has been going on for}} decades, and this ep throws the whole thing out the window in about two minutes. No other cause for BJ's actions is ever given... That's some lazy writing right there." [...] Meghan Deans from Tor.com gave the episode a mixed review and wrote that it was [...] "sort of good [...] sort of a terrible idea". She cited the theme of [...] "breaking the cycle of abuse" [...] as a plus for the entry, noting that it was a [...] "revenge story [...] a woman righting the wrongs of her male ancestors and breaking the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> outside the family". However, Deans was critical of various elements of the episode, most notably, the genetic theory conceit and the idea of a [...] "activator baby" [...] that caused Morrow's past ancestors to work through her.|$|E

500|$|In {{describing}} {{the premise of}} the novel, Le Guin stated [...] "the hero of the book, the protagonist, he has a different gift, it isn’t magic at all, in fact, it’s another kind of talent. And his problem is to realize that he doesn’t have the kind he’s supposed to have, he has this other one. Which is a problem, actually, {{a lot of young people}} face: What is my gift?" [...] Reviewers have described Orrec's search for his own identity, in contrast to the identity that has been thrust upon him, as one of the major themes of the novel. This theme is related to the other major theme of the novel, that of power and responsibility. As he comes to terms with his identity, Orrec questions whether he is betraying his power by refusing to try to use it. Gry, too, is unwilling to use her gift to call animals to be hunted, and wonders whether [...] "all the gifts are backward.... They could have been healing, to begin with." [...] The novel ends with the two protagonists realizing that they are unwilling to remain in the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and retribution in the Uplands, and leaving to keep their integrity; but they are also running toward a place where they can use their gifts as they please, rather than simply running away. A part of Orrec and Gry's process of growing up is to see beyond the binary choices they are presented with by society. Orrec is faced with a choice of whether to use his power, or to be blindfolded; Gry has to use her power to hunt, or not. Gry realizes that all of the upland powers can be used in two ways: for control and dominion, or for healing and nurturing. This recognition allows them to take a third choice, and leave. This wrestling with choice has been compared to the choices the characters are forced to make in Le Guin's novella The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas.|$|E
