30|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on the {{development}} of a prototype of an optical liquid sensor. The prototype is based on a refined sensor that was originally developed for gloss inspection from rough surfaces in field measurement conditions, such as <b>cold-rolling</b> <b>products</b> in metal industry [17]. We have modified such a glossmeter by implementing a removable sensor head that was used in laboratory conditions for the detection of authentic and adulterated diesel oils.|$|R
50|$|Cold rolling {{occurs with}} the metal below its {{recrystallization}} temperature (usually at room temperature), {{which increases the}} strength via strain hardening up to 20%. It also improves the surface finish and holds tighter tolerances. Commonly <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>products</b> include sheets, strips, bars, and rods; these products are usually smaller than the same products that are hot rolled. Because of the smaller size of the workpieces and their greater strength, as compared to hot rolled stock, four-high or cluster mills are used. Cold rolling cannot reduce the thickness of a workpiece as much as hot rolling in a single pass.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen an {{increase}} in the use of structural stainless steel, mainly owing to its aesthetic and architectural qualities alongside durability. Among stainless steels, ferritic grades are characterized by low nickel content resulting in a more cost-stable and economic material compared with austenitic stainless steels, allowing a balanced approach between economic and environmental aspects. As an introduction, this paper presents the recent research outcomes especially concerning the currently ongoing RFCS project “Structural Applications of Ferritic Stainless Steels”. Then, attention is paid to the advantages and challenges {{associated with the use of}} this material in recent construction projects in view of sustainability. Life cycle analysis is explained. The background of the new European standard EN 15804 is described, including Module D, which takes now into account the end-of-life phase. Life cycle inventories of stainless steel <b>products</b> (<b>cold-rolled</b> coils and quarto plate) are presented.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen an {{increase}} in the use of stainless steel in buildings, mainly owing to its corrosion properties and therefore long service life. Among stainless steels, ferritic and lean duplex grades are characterized by low nickel content resulting in a more cost-stable and economic material compared to austenitic stainless steels. These grades have comparable (or even higher) strength than carbon steel and good corrosion resistance at lower cost. That is why, lately, they have been more often used in structural components. In this paper, attention is firstly paid to the advantages {{associated with the use of}} stainless steel in recent construction projects in view of sustainability. Secondly, life cycle analysis and the background of the new European standard EN 15804 are introduced, including Module D, which allows credits to be taken now for the eventual reuse or recycling of material in the future, at the end-of-life stage. Life cycle inventories of stainless steel <b>products</b> (<b>cold-rolled</b> coils and quarto plate) are presented. Depending on the fraction of material recovered at the end of the lifespan, two potential impacts (Primary Energy Demand and Global Warming Potential) are presented for four grades: 1. 4301 (AISI 304) and 1. 4401 (AISI 316) austenitic grades, 1. 4016 (AISI 430) ferritic grade and 1. 4462 (AISI 2205) duplex grade.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{life cycle}} inventories (LCI) {{of stainless steel}} <b>products</b> (<b>cold-rolled</b> coils) {{with a focus on}} the challenges associated to the use of this material in the construction domain: roofs, façades, technical equipment, structural components. After an introduction describing recent applications of stainless steel in the construction domain, an overview of the challenges related to the use of this material is presented. In this section, a special attention paid to the Leadership in Environmental and Engineering Design (LEED) developed by the US Green Building Council (USGBC), {{that was one of the}} world’s first green building rating system (1990) and most widely used internationally. The most recognized European environmental assessment methods will also be mentioned. Several grades will then be described with regard to their mechanical (resistance and ductility) and physical properties (solar reflectance, thermal emittance) as well as surface finishes available for the construction domain. Afterwards, three grades in the form of cold-rolled coils (grades 304, 316 and 430) will be compared in terms of life-cycle inventory from cradle to gate including the end-of-life treatment. Indeed, since stainless steel is recycled to more than 90 % at the end of its life and recyclable and indefinite number of times, the method that will be taken into account is referred as “allocation for scrap inputs and outputs using the closed material loop recycling methodology”. A short description of the reference method will also be provided. Last, depending on the recycling rate and thus net recycling content, several impacts such as the energy demand and CO 2 emissions will be compared. The influence of the end-of-life credit method will be underlined and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Hot-dip {{galvanising}} {{is commonly}} used in industry to increase the corrosion resistance of <b>cold-rolled</b> steel <b>products</b> for commercial use such as roofing and walling of buildings. Traditionally, the zinc coated steel surface is characterised by a relatively smooth surface with large spangle relief which is detrimental to corrosion resistance. One of the techniques to modify the surface appearance consists of a water-mist spray solution which allows {{for the creation of}} a large number of nucleation sites giving rise to micro rather than macro spangles, thereby producing a much smoother surface. In addition, controlling the spray parameters allows the hot, zinc coated, steel surface to be ‘roughened’ facilitating its bonding to concrete or for lamination. The proper control of water droplet impact parameters such as impact velocity, droplet diameter and crater size is essential for a successful implementation of this technique. Certain aspects of the second of these processes, the production of rough, non-skid galvanised steel sheet surfaces, has been addressed by this thesis. Although an experimental investigation of the effect of such water droplet parameters on the formation of zinc surface characteristics such as crater diameter and depth would provide a great deal of valuable data it is fraught with difficulties. The presence of hot metal surfaces exceeding 450 oC and the boiling and evaporation of water droplets taking place at very small timescales (microseconds) all combine to make an experimental study difficult to implement not to say unsafe. On the other hand computer simulations with a properly constructed mathematical model are a valuable tool for the investigation of these parameters. A comprehensive modelling of the process would include the process of heat transfer: such as conduction through a vapour layer, internal droplet and vapour convection, radiation from the hot surface, solidification of the zinc liquid layer; as well as the fluid dynamical aspects: such as surface tension at the droplet-air, droplet-zinc and zinc-air interfaces, the droplet impact phenomena such as spreading and splashing and the formation of impact craters and wave propagation in a thin viscous zinc layer. As a first stage in the modelling exercise this thesis will concentrate on an investigation of single water droplet impact on a thin liquid zinc layer with a steel substrate which provides a simplified and computationally tractable model of the spraying process. The objectives of this thesis are twofold: firstly, the development and construction of an accurate, robust mathematical model and, secondly, the solution of the model for the impact of a single water droplet onto a thin liquid layer of zinc on a steel substrate. This model must be able to deal with rapidly deforming moving interfaces and maintain stability in the presence of very large density and viscosity ratios. This moving boundary problem requires the tracking of three fluid interfaces while also maintaining incompressibility. The Godunov-Marker-Particle Projection Scheme developed in this thesis is able to satisfy these requirements. Through a combination of approximate projection methods, Godunov convective differencing, Marker-Particle interface tracking and velocity filters the method is able to treat viscous, multi-fluid free surface flows. The modelling of free surface flows with more than two separate immiscible fluids, to the author’s knowledge not yet published in the literature, is a secondary aim of the thesis. A major part of the thesis deals with the thorough testing of each aspect of the combination of numerical methods used: firstly, the Poisson solver with discontinuous coefficients and homogeneous boundary conditions used in the approximate projection method, analytical solutions for the construction of an initial solenoidal velocity field, testing of the projection and velocity filters and kinematic tests of the Marker-Particle method for tracking of fluid interfaces; secondly, dynamical tests of the viscous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for: an exact solution, the Lid-Driven Cavity and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The combined method is also successfully tested on the limited two-fluid droplet-solid and droplet-liquid impact problems before solving the thesis problem. It is shown that, for the impact of a single water droplet onto a thin liquid zinc layer, impact crater growth, diameter and depth, are linearly dependent on impact velocity. For a given impact velocity, crater diameter is not effected by increasing zinc layer depth although crater depth is linearly dependent. The time at which the droplet commences penetration of the zinc layer is inversely dependent on impact velocity and the maximum crater diameter and depth are nonlinearly dependent on impact velocity. The model shows that, within the convective timescale, droplet impact on thin liquid zinc layers can be approximately described by droplet spreading on a solid zinc surface. The droplet is shown to spread preferentially to the zinc layer splashing after completion of spreading. This shows that adjustment of the droplet impact velocity or zinc layer depth can vary the surface roughness appropriately...|$|R
