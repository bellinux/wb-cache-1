Since the governmental resources are scarce in most transitional countries, as isthe case in Kosova, they need to be allocated based on priority needs, in order to ensure greater efficiency. In post-war Kosova the primary objectives of drafting policies were concentrated around establishingbudgeting systems, collecting revenues by means of the tax system and development of a comprehensivereconstruction programme, it could be said that these goals were achieved within a short period of time. When we take into account the fact that the <b>Central</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Authority</b> of Kosova (CBAK) is still unableto completely manage the monetary policy, and does this only to a certain extent, and the fact that Kosovauntil now did not have access to additional foreign financing, these elements make it all the more necessaryto be more careful in preserving fiscal sustainability, since the fiscal policy, until now, was the sole meansof macroeconomic policies {{at the hands of the}} government.

40|$|The {{effects of}} changes in {{interest}} rates and their impacts on the stock returns {{is a very interesting}} topic especially for academics, regulators and professional practitioners, both in the private and the public sectors. This issue is also important in matters related to risk management practices, monetary policy formulation by the <b>central</b> <b>banking</b> <b>authority,</b> as well as the valuation of securities. However, despite that most researchers devoted in this specific area, their related findings have been found to fluctuate with changes in macro-economic changes. This paper scrutinizes the effect of expected and unexpected interest rate changes on the stock returns of the United Kingdom (UK) firms. The economic policy shock is created from the alteration in the three-month real London Inter Bank Offer Rate future contracts. An event study is to be conducted in order to evaluate the effect of expected changes in the financial strategy on stock returns. The results from the regression model are expected to indicate a noteworthy relationship between interest rates and the UK stock returns of companies operating in different sectors of UK economy. The paper will also help to observe the effect of macroeconomic variables such as interest rates, GDP, inflation on stock returns in the UK. The main objective of the paper is to observe the peculiarities in terms of the influence of chosen macroeconomic variables on stock returns in the London Stock Market.

We also study the impact in terms of policy effectiveness of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> communication before the actual operations. Our results suggest that appropriate speeches clarifying the current intervention policy can have marginally virtuous effects, both in terms of exchange rate level and exchange rate volatility. This leads us to conclude that, in general, actual interventions on the market should still be employed, provided that official statements are used to clarify the nature and purpose of these interventions.

On the 15 November on the same year has been established the Central Bank of Kosovo entitled as the Banking and Payment Authority of Kosovo (BPK). Now there are ten years past from {{the establishment of the}} Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo and the initial functioning of Kosovo financial system. With the development of Kosovo economical environment in general and its financial system development in particular, the need for enlargement of objectives and functions of this institution showed up.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{standard}} macroeconomic models are {{combined with the}} Hayek-Garrison model of the business cycle in order to demonstrate in which way modern <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> are prone to initiate boom-bust-cycles through monetary policy. It is shown under which conditions such a policy will occur and why <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>authorities</b> tend to be misled by an apparently stable price-level. Without <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> interference, productivity increases due to technological advances, other cost reductions or an increased supply of cheaper labor would bring about temporary deflation. Left to its natural path, rising profits and a higher purchasing power would move the economy towards an expansion and increased expenditures. However, with <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> interventions that are directed at maintaining the so-called price level, the monetary authorities will expand the money supply and transform a productivity-led wealth increase into a debt-driven boom, which produces {{the foundation for the}} bust later on.

40|$|Macroprudential regulation, {{which has}} emerged as a new {{departure}} in financial regulation (albeit with a longer heritage), since the financial crash, is in a fluid, evolving and highly experimental phase. Understanding its future political economy requires engaging with macroprudential's constituent concepts and how they interrelate to one another. This paper argues that the emerging political economy of macroprudential regulation revolves around five paradoxes. The first three of these are paradoxes that characterise the financial system and are identified by the macroprudential perspective. In seeking to respond to these paradoxes, macroprudential policy, generates a further two distinctly institutional and political paradoxes. The last of these is a central bankers' paradox which relates to the source of independent <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>authority</b> and the difficulty of building legitimacy and public support for macroprudential regulation. Functioning macroprudential regulation is about executing a technocratic control project that rests on a depoliticisation strategy, that in turn risks politicising <b>central</b> <b>banks,</b> exposing their claims to technical authority to critical scrutiny and potential political backlash. This is the ultimate central bankers’ paradox in the era of post-crash political economy. <b>Central</b> <b>banks</b> conducting macroprudential regulation {{need to be aware of}} this paradox and handle it with great care...|$|R

The information on the distribution of the underlying asset thus obtained is very important to the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>authorities</b> since this allows them to monitor market expectations regarding future price movements. Alternatively, market reaction to <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> monetary policy changes may be judged this way.

In that situation, the information on the distribution recovered from highly traded products from the exchange may be used as representative for the OTC products as well.
