The <b>wire</b> <b>clamp</b> is piezoelectrically actuated and a two-stage flexure-based amplification was designed to obtain large and parallel jaw displacements. The grasping forces of the <b>wire</b> <b>clamp</b> were evaluated based on finite element analysis (FEA), and the force measurement was presented. The <b>wire</b> <b>clamp</b> was manufactured using wire EDM technique and the position and force transfer functions were obtained based on the frequency response approach. The position/force switching control strategy was employed to regulate the motion position and grasping force, and the position/force switching controller composed of a PID controller for position control and a sliding model controller (SMC) for force control was designed. Experimental tests were carried out to investigate the performance of <b>wire</b> <b>clamp</b> with the position/force switching controller during the grasping and releasing operations.

40|$|In this paper, two {{procedures}} are developed for lumped-parameter circuit modeling of injection probes for {{bulk current injection}} (BCI). Both {{procedures are}} based on frequency domain scattering-parameter measurements, and refer to a <b>clamped</b> <b>wiring</b> composed of a single-ended interconnection. One procedure exploits a black-box approach, requires a calibration fixture, and is suited for practical implementation. The other is based on circuit interpretation of coupling and propagation effects, and is aimed at a theoretical analysis of injection. The former procedure requires an accurate deembedding of fixture-related effects, and the latter requires a detailed knowledge of the geometry of the probe interior parts. The two procedures lead to probe circuit models topologically equivalent, with lumped-Pi structure, performing well in the frequency band of interest for BCI. In the derivation, it is shown that the probe input impedance is the central quantity for the characterization of the frequency-dependent properties of the ferrite core, and for the modeling of inductive coupling (dominant effect). The probe circuit models developed in this paper go over the frequency limitations of previous models, and allow for accurate description of the frequency-dependent voltage transfer ratio and series impedance of the probe...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the study}} was to find a proper {{technique}} to fix tendon grafts into an INSTRON loading machine. From 8 human cadavers, 40 grafts were collected. We removed the bone-patella tendon-bone grafts, the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons, the quadriceps tendon-bone grafts, the Achilles tendons, and the peroneus longus tendons from each lower extremity. We tested the tendon grafts with five different types of fixation devices: surgical thread (Premicron 3), general mounting <b>clamp,</b> <b>wire</b> mesh, cement fixation, and a modified clamp for an INSTRON loading machine. The mean failure load in case of surgical thread fixation was (381 N ± 26 N). The results with the general clamp were (527 N ± 45 N). The wire meshes were more promising (750 N ± 21 N), but did not reach the outcomes we desired. Easy slippages of the ends of the tendons from the cement encasements were observed (253 N ± 18 N). We then began to use Shi’s clamp that could produce 977 N ± 416 N peak force. We combined Shi’s clamp with freezing of the graft and the rupture of the tendon itself demonstrated an average force of 2198 N ± 773 N. We determined that our modified frozen clamp fixed the specimens against high tensile forces...|$|R

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that <b>clamping</b> a tensioned <b>wire</b> {{can cause a}} reduction in wire tension. Tension (about 1275 N) was applied to a wire that was subsequently clamped, using cannulated bolts, to the steel half-ring of an Ilizarov external fixator. The tension in the wire was monitored before, during and after clamping. The apparatus was disassembled and the deformations in the wire caused by the clamps were measured. This experiment was repeated 15 times. When the <b>wire</b> was <b>clamped</b> to the frame, the wire tension was reduced by 22 +/- 7 per cent (mean +/- standard deviation, SD). The drop in wire tension was linearly correlated (r = 0. 96; p < 0. 001) with the deformation caused by the bolts. A finite element (FE) model of the wire was also constructed. The model was pre-stressed (tensioned), and the clamping effect replicated. This analysis showed that <b>clamping</b> the <b>wire</b> could be considered to squeeze the wire outwards (like toothpaste from a tube) and so reduce its tension during fixator assembly. To assess {{the magnitude of this}} effect in the clinical situation, the FE model analysis was repeated to replicate clamping a 1. 8 -mm-diameter wire to a 180 -mm-diameter steel Ilizarov ring component. The analysis showed that for these conditions the tension reduced by 8 - 29 per cent. The results of this study highlight a general engineering problem: how can a tensioned wire be secured to a structure without an appreciable loss of tension? If the performance of the structure depends on the wire tension, this performance will change when the wire is secured...|$|R

The mechanism of settling after load cycling is investigated. Detension under load is a major problem of wires. By means of vibration frequency measurements, tests on single wire allow determination of reduction in wire tension due to transverse loading: it is found that, almost independently from the amount of clamp tightening, the tension reaches a lower limit related only to the transverse load and not related to pretension. It is shown that, for higher <b>clamp</b> tightening torques, <b>wire</b> detension must be attributed to permanent plastic deformation of the wires; moreover, it is shown that the unavoidable errors in the spacing of the tensioned wires lead to marked decrease of their stiffness under transverse loa...|$|R
50|$|One of the {{fundamental}} goals of most hose clamps is to ensure a tight seal between the hose and the barb, preventing the working fluid from escaping. To this goal, {{they are designed to}} provide even pressure on all sides, with no gaps. An example of this would be <b>wire</b> <b>clamps.</b> An obvious design would seem to be simply having a wire around the hose, one end attached to a nut, and the other end to the screw, and when tightened, pulling the ends of the wire towards each other. However, this will leave a gap where no pressure is applied (underneath the screw), and cause a leak. To combat this, the more complicated and weaker design of having the ends overlap and then be pushed apart from each other is used, as this ensures pressure around the entire circumference of the hose.|$|R
40|$|The wire–bolt {{interface}} in an Ilizarov frame {{has been}} mechanically tested. The optimal torque {{to be applied}} to the frame locking-bolts during physiological loading has been defined. The set-up configuration was as is used clinically except a copper tube was used to simulate bone. The force–displacement curves of the Ilizarov wires are not altered by locking-bolt torque. The force in the bone model at which pre-tension is lost increases as the locking-bolts are tightened to 14 Nm torque, but decreases if torque exceeds 14 Nm. Thus, 14 Nm is the optimal locking-bolt torque in frame. The relationship between pre-tension versus load for different locking-bolt torques arises because at low and high <b>clamping</b> torques poor <b>wire</b> holding and plastic deformation respectively occur. Wire damage was seen under light and electron microscopy.

40|$|The {{technology}} used in surgery for spinal deformity has progressed rapidly in recent years. Commonly used fixation techniques may include monofilament wires, sublaminar wires and cables, and pedicle screws. Unfortunately, neurological complications can occur {{with all of}} these, compromising the patients’ health and quality of life. Recently, an alternative fixation technique using a metal clamp and polyester belt was developed to replace hooks and sublaminar wiring in scoliosis surgery. The goal {{of this study was}} to compare the pull-out strength of this new construct with sublaminar wiring, laminar hooks and pedicle screws. Forty thoracic vertebrae from five fresh frozen human thoracic spines (T 5 – 12) were divided into five groups (8 per group), such that BMD values, pedicle diameter, and vertebral levels were equally distributed. They were then potted in polymethylmethacrylate and anchored with metal screws and polyethylene bands. One of five fixation methods was applied to the right side of the vertebra in each group: Pedicle screw, sublaminar belt with clamp, figure- 8 belt with <b>clamp,</b> sublaminar <b>wire,</b> or laminar hook. Pull-out strength was then assessed using a custom jig in a servohydraulic tester. The mean failure load of the pedicle screw group was significantly larger than that of the figure- 8 clamp (P =  0. 001), sublaminar belt (0. 0172), and sublaminar wire groups (P =  0. 04) with no significant difference in pull-out strength between the latter three constructs. The most common mode of failure was the fracture of the pedicle. BMD was significantly correlated with failure load only in the figure- 8 clamp and pedicle screw constructs. Only the pedicle screw had a statistically significant higher failure load than the sublaminar clamp. The sublaminar method of applying the belt and clamp device was superior to the figure- 8 method. The sublaminar belt and clamp construct compared favorably to the traditional methods of sublaminar wires and laminar hooks, and should be considered as an alternative fixation device in the thoracic spine...|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that the clamped-wire system used to suspend bones within an Ilizarov external fixator yields when the perpendicular load exceeds 50 N per wire. Cyclic loading was applied to tensioned <b>wires</b> <b>clamped</b> within an Ilizarov ring component, with steadily increasing load amplitude. Wires were tested at four initial tension settings. The amount of energy lost within the clamped-wire system per load cycle was calculated for every test. The results showed {{that there was a}} consistent trend to increasing non-recoverable energy loss per load cycle when peak loads exceed 50 N for all initial tension settings. A finite element (FE) model replicating the experimental conditions was performed to investigate the levels of stress within the loaded wires. The FE model analyses showed that high stresses were generated in the wires close to the clamping sites, and that the stress levels could reasonably be expected to exceed the material yield stress when loaded to about 55 N, for all initial tension settings. The results show that material yield, accompanied by some wire slippage through the clamps, is responsible for system yield, in agreement with previous studies. Although the initial wire tension has an appreciable effect on the wire stiffness, it did not affect the elastic load range of the clamped-wire system. To prevent yield of the clamped-wire system in practice, the fixator should be assembled with sufficient wires to ensure that the load transmitted to each wire by the patient does not exceed 50 N...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} methods developed to increase {{the quality of the}} crescent bond together with the tail bond quality. Low pull force of the crescent bond limits the usage of insulated Au wire in microelectronics assembly. Premature break of the tail which results in the stoppage of the bonding machine is one of obstacles to overcome for Cu wire. The primary focus of this thesis is to understand the tail and crescent bonding process and then to propose methodologies to improve thermosonic wire bonding processes when Cu and insulated Au wires are used. Several series of experiments to investigate the crescent and tail bonding processes are performed on auto bonders. Cu and insulated Au wires with diameters of 25 mm are bonded on the diepads of Ag leadframes. For simplicity, wire loops are oriented perpendicular to the ultrasonic direction. It was found that the crescent bond breaking force by pulling the wire loop (pull force) with insulated Au wire is about 80 % of that of bare Au wire. A modification of the crescent bonding process is made to increase the pull force with insulated Au wire. In the modified process, an insulation layer removing stage (cleaning stage) is inserted before the bonding stage. The cleaning stage consists of a scratching motion (shift) toward to the ball bond in combination with ultrasound. Bonds are then made on the fresh diepad with the insulation removed from the contact surface of the insulated Au wire. This process increases the pull force of the crescent bond up to 26 % which makes it comparable to the results obtained with bare Au wire. An online tail breaking force measurement method is developed with a proximity sensor between <b>wire</b> <b>clamp</b> and horn. Detailed understanding of tail bond formation is achieved by studying tail bond imprints with scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analysis. Descriptions are given of the dependence of the tail breaking force on the bonding parameters, metallization variation, and cleanliness of the bond pad. Simultaneous optimization with pull force and tail breaking force can optimize the Cu wire bonding process both with high quality and robustness. It is recommended to first carry out conventional pull force optimization followed by a minimization of the bonding force parameter to the lowest value still fulfilling the pull force cpk requirement. The tail bond forms not only under the capillary chamfer, but also under the capillary hole. The tail breaking force includes both the interfacial bond breaking strength and the breaking strength of the thinned portion of the wire that will remain at the substrate as residue. Close investigations of the tail bond imprint with scanning electron microscopy indicate the presence of fractures of the substrate indicating substrate material being picked up by Cu wire tail. Pick up is found on Au and Cu wires, but the amount of pick up is much larger on Cu wire. The effect on the hardness of the subsequently formed Cu free air ball (FAB) as investigated with scanning electron microscopy and micro - hardness test shows that Cu FABs containing Au and Ag pick ups are softer than those without pick up. However, the hardness varies significantly more with Au pick up. The amount of Au pick up is estimated higher than 0. 03 % of the subsequently formed FAB volume, exceeding typical impurity and dopant concentrations (0. 01 %) added during manufacturing of the wire...|$|R
