As tributes poured in, Evangeline protested: ‘The Salvation Army has had no new success; we have only done an old thing in an old way.’ The American people disagreed, and subscribed an unprecedented $13 million to clear debts incurred by The Army, through its provision of canteens, hostels, rest rooms during the war, and afterwards on the provision of <b>care</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation</b> for the returning forces.

40|$|Women {{of childbearing}} age are the fastest growing segment of the incarcerated {{population}} in the United States, and {{it is estimated that}} at least 6 - 10 % of the more than 200, 000 women incarcerated each year are pregnant. Pregnant inmates enter into the correctional system with significant health needs and are at high risk for pregnancy complications and poor birth outcomes {{as a result of the}} poverty, substance abuse, histories of violence, co-occurring medical and mental health disorders, and low access to care prevalent among this population. However, the US correctional system, originally designed to meet the needs of males, is not structured to provide the adequate levels of prenatal <b>care</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodations</b> required to meet the complex needs of female inmates. The delivery of prenatal care to pregnant inmates is an issue of public health importance due to the opportunity jails and prisons offer to extend early <b>and</b> adequate prenatal <b>care</b> <b>and</b> services to medically underserved women unlikely to access such care in the community, improve the health and wellbeing of mothers and infants at high-risk for poor birth outcomes, and decrease excess health care costs associated with adverse birth outcomes.

The population structure in the country means that in the not too distant future, there will be a sharp rise in demand for <b>care</b> <b>and</b> elderly <b>accommodation.</b> A tighter credit market as a consequence of new rules and regulations with a stricter capital and liquidity requirements combined with market turbulence, has made financing property developement more difficult and more expensive which has resulted in many companies using alternative sources of finance.

There has also been a debate about whether institutional investors as the AP pension funds really should own properties directly. As properties for <b>care</b> <b>and</b> elderly <b>accommodation</b> are definable assets with predictable payment flows, long leases and often a local authority as tenant that would not risk cancelling payments, these would be highly appropriate for securitisation, i. e. to issue bonds or other tradable securities based on the cash flows from the assets.

40|$|Most {{patients}} admitted for inpatient rehabilitation find it beneficial {{even when}} there is little change in physical disability. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the characteristics of patients who felt that they had not benefited from inpatient rehabilitation and to delineate the underlying reasons for this perception. From a database of 331 patients admitted to a neurological rehabilitation unit over a three-year period, we ascertained those with a low score (< 5) on a self-rated visual analogue scale (VAS) regarding their perception of the benefit of rehabilitation. We investigated their disability outcomes, aspects of the rehabilitation process through analysis of integrated care pathways, and from inspection of the multidisciplinary record identified specific adverse factors which might contribute to dissatisfaction. Low VAS scores were detected in 6 % of patients (n = 19). These did not correlate with baseline demographic factors or disability levels, but were associated with unresolved external problems regarding community <b>care</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation,</b> and conflicts between patients and therapists. We conclude that from the patients' perspective, successful inpatient rehabilitation depends on adequate attention given to community-based issues and health care professionals recognising patients' needs. When these two conditions are not fulfilled, patients are more likely to express a lack of satisfaction with their rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|Managing {{the assets}} of older people is a common and {{potentially}} complex task of informal care with legal, financial, cultural, political and family dimensions. Older people are increasingly recognised as having significant assets, but the family, the state, service providers and the market have competing interests in their use. Increased policy interest in self-provision and user-charges for services underline the importance of asset management in protecting the current and future health, <b>care</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation</b> choices of older people. Although ‘minding the money’ has generally been included as an informal care-giving task, there is limited recognition of either its growing importance and complexity or of care-givers' involvement. The focus of both policy and practice have been primarily on substitute decision-making and abuse. This paper reports an Australian national survey and semi-structured interviews that have explored the prevalence of non-professional involvement in asset management. The findings reveal {{the nature and extent}} of involvement, the tasks that informal carers take on, the management processes that they use, and that ‘minding the money’ is a common informal care task and mostly undertaken in the private sphere using some risky practices. Assisting informal care-givers with asset management and protecting older people from financial risks and abuse require various strategic policy and practice responses that extend beyond substitute decision-making legislation. Policies and programmes are required: to increase the awareness of the tasks, tensions and practices surrounding asset management; to improve the financial literacy of older people, their informal care-givers and service providers; to ensure access to information, advice and support services; and to develop better accountability practices. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{sounds of}} buzzing {{electric}} clippers echoed around The University of Notre Dame Australia’s Prindiville Hall as brave staff and {{students from the}} Fremantle Campus shaved, coloured and waxed their hair for the Leukaemia Foundation’s World’s Greatest Shave. Fourth year Health and Physical Education student Michael Brinsden joined five other team members on Wednesday, 18 April, to raise awareness about blood cancer and much needed funds for cancer research. Mr Brinsden’s team raised more than $ 2000 for the Leukaemia Foundation. Health and Physical Education Lecturer Rob Merrells volunteered to have both his head shaved and legs waxed for the occasion. Mr Merrells signed up {{in support of his}} younger sister Jess who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in 2009. He raised more than $ 650 for the cause. Fremantle Dockers’ utility Matt de Boer also offered his assistance during the shave, swapping the Sherrin football for a waxing strip to remove the hair from Notre Dame student Kane Mitchell. “Today was about raising awareness of cancer in the university community,” Mr Brinsden said. “The take home message from the World’s Greatest Shave event at Notre Dame was ‘the six degrees of separation’. If cancer doesn’t affect us directly, then there is a strong possibility that we have a friend or family member who has been affected. ” The money raised from the World’s Greatest Shave funds free services to support patients and their families, including information, emotional <b>care</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation</b> for regional Western Australians required to move closer to city hospitals for cancer treatment.

40|$|This audit {{assessed}} the Department of Health and Ageing 2 ̆ 7 s implementation and ongoing {{management of the}} Aged Care Complaints Scheme {{and the effectiveness of}} their complaint management systems in supporting service delivery and regulatory outcomes. The Australian Government subsidises residential aged care places to assist with the cost of <b>care</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation</b> services for eligible older Australians. As at 30 June 2010, there were approximately 183 000 government funded residential places, provided at a cost of 7. 3 billion, or approximately 40 000 per recipient. Almost one in four persons aged 85 years and over is in a residential care facility. The importance of residential aged care is increasing rapidly, with the number of persons aged 85 years and over estimated to increase by 120 per cent over the 20 years to 2030. The Aged Care Act 1997 (the Act) and related legislative instruments (Aged Care Principles) establish the framework for financial support for residential aged care places and regulate the conditions of that support. The Act also specifies a number of objects that relate to the quality, type and level of care to be provided in aged care facilities, and provides for a complaints scheme. The complaints scheme was introduced as a means to help ensure that providers meet their responsibilities to provide high standards of care to aged care recipients, who can be among the most vulnerable members of society. As with other complaints schemes, effective handling of aged care complaints assists in resolving problems before they become worse, providing a remedy to clients who have suffered disadvantage, and nurturing good relationships between service providers, government agencies and the public. Complaints also provide useful information about potential program weaknesses and service delivery faults...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To explore {{reasons for}} institutionalization {{of people with}} {{dementia}} according to informal caregivers as well as variation in reasons between countries. Design: An explorative cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} 8 European countries. Setting: Per country, a minimum of 3 long term care facilities, offering <b>care</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation</b> as a package, participated in this study. Participating countries were selected to represent different geographic areas in Europe. Participants: Of the 791 informal caregivers involved in the RightTimePlaceCare project of people with dementia who were recently admitted to a long term care facility, 786 were included for this study. Measurements: As part of a semistructured interview, informal caregivers were asked the main reason for institutionalization in an open-ended question. Answers were categorized according to a conventional coding approach. All reasons were then quantified and tested. Results: Mainly patient-related reasons were stated, such as neuropsychiatric symptoms (25 %), care dependency (24 %), and cognition (19 %). Neuropsychiatric symptoms were among the most often mentioned reasons in most countries. Besides patient-related reasons, caregiver burden and the inability of the informal caregiver to care for the patient were stated as reasons (both 15 %). Further analyses showed countries differ significantly in reasons according to informal caregivers. Additionally, reasons were analyzed for spouses and child-caregivers, showing that spouses more often stated reasons related to themselves compared with child-caregivers. Conclusion: Multiple reasons contribute to the institutionalization for people with dementia, with several factors that may influence why there were country differences. Variation in the organization of dementia care and cultural aspects, or the relationship between the informal caregiver and person with dementia may be factors influencing the reasons. Because of a wide variation in reasons between countries, no one-size-fits-all approach can be offered to guide informal caregivers when facing the possibility of institutionalization of the person with dementia.

40|$|This report {{sets out}} a series of {{proposals}} to deal with weaknesses and challenges in the aged care system and promote higher quality care. The aged care system is difficult to navigate, the quantity of services is limited, quality can be variable, there are gaps in service coverage and limited choices for care recipients. Pricing, subsidies and user co-contributions are inconsistent and inequitable within and between care settings. Workforce shortages are exacerbated by uncompetitive wages and over-regulation. The system will be further challenged by an increase in the numbers and expectations of older people, a relative decline in informal carers and the need for a larger workforce. The focus of the recommendations in this repor is on enhancing the wellbeing of older Australians – promoting independence, connectedness and choice. Under the proposed reforms, older Australians would: •    contact a simplified 2 ̆ 7 gateway 2 ̆ 7 for: easily understood information; assessments of care needs; assessments of financial capacity to make co-contributions; entitlements to approved services; and care coordination – all at a regional level •    receive a flexible range of care and support services that meet their individual needs and that emphasise, where possible, restorative care and rehabilitation •    choose, where feasible and appropriate, to receive care at home or in a residential facility and choose their approved provider •    contribute in part to their cost of care (with a maximum lifetime limit) and meet their accommodation and living expenses (with safety nets for those with limited means) •    have access to a government sponsored equity release scheme to pay for their <b>care</b> <b>and</b> <b>accommodation</b> charges if they have assets but limited annual incomes •    choose between paying a daily charge or an equivalent bond for the accommodation costs of residential care — with both aligned to the real cost of accommodation •    retain their age pension when selling their home (and if paying a lower capital sum or a daily charge for their new accommodation) by purchasing an Australian Pensioners Bond •    choose whether to purchase additional services or a higher quality of accommodation if that is what they want and can afford to do so.   Image: 2 ̆ 7 Elderly woman and her view 2 ̆ 7, Borya / flick...|$|E
