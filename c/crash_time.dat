50|$|In large tokamaks {{with larger}} Lundquist numbers, {{sawtooth}} relaxations are observed to occur {{much faster than}} predicted by the resistive Kadomtsev model. Simulations using two-fluid model equations or non-ideal terms in Ohm's law besides the resistive term, such as the Hall and electron inertia terms, can account for the fast <b>crash</b> <b>times</b> observed in hot tokamaks. These models can allow much faster reconnection at low resistivity.|$|R
50|$|The first {{results of}} a {{numerical}} simulation that provided verification of the Kadomtsev model were published in 1976. This simulation demonstrated a single Kadomtsev-like sawtooth relaxation. In 1987 the first {{results of a}} simulation demonstrating repeated, quasi-periodic sawtooth relaxations was published. Results from resistive MHD simulations of repeated sawtoothing generally give reasonably accurate <b>crash</b> <b>times</b> and sawtooth period times for smaller tokamaks with relatively small Lundquist numbers.|$|R
