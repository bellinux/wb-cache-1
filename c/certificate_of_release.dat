50|$|In {{order to}} have the record of a lien {{released}} a taxpayer must obtain a <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Release</b> of Federal Tax Lien. Generally, the IRS will not issue a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> of lien until the tax has either been paid in full or the IRS no longer has a legal interest in collecting the tax. The IRS has standardized procedures for lien releases, discharges and subordination. In situations that qualify {{for the removal of}} a lien, the IRS will generally remove the lien within 30 days and the taxpayer may receive a copy of the <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Release</b> of Federal Tax Lien. The current form of the Notice of Federal Tax Lien utilized by the IRS contains a provision that provides that the NFTL is released by its own terms {{at the conclusion of the}} statute of limitations period described above provided that the NFTL has not been refiled by the date indicated on the form. The effect of this provision is that the NFTL operates as a <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Release</b> of Federal Tax Lien on the day after the date indicated in the form by its own terms.|$|E

Hunt's DD-214 also stated he had served in a classified location from 2002 until 2003.|$|E
5000|$|The DD Form 214, <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Release</b> or Discharge from Active Duty, {{generally}} {{referred to}} as a [...] "DD 214", is a document of the United States Department of Defense, issued upon a military service member's retirement, separation, or discharge from active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States, e.g., U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Air Force or U.S. Coast Guard.|$|E

5000|$|Prisons {{records and}} the death {{registers}} are misleading, since {{it is known that}} <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> were regularly signed by or for men who were then taken out and shot, and that certificates alleging heart attacks or apoplexy were made out for corpses left on the open road. Execution techniques deliberately disfigured the corpses so as to make them unrecognizable. Officials of the time have testified that families were afraid to report missing male members, and did not come to identify the bodies of the dead. Thousands of victims of the White Terror are buried in hundreds of unmarked common graves (over 2,000), more than 600 in Andalusia alone. The largest of these is the common grave at San Rafael cemetery on the outskirts of Málaga (with perhaps more than 4,000 bodies). The Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory (Asociación para la Recuperación de la Memoria Historica or ARMH) says that the number of disappeared is over 35,000.|$|R
50|$|Vaiben and {{his brother}} Emanuel Solomon were arrested at a {{boarding}} house in Northallerton {{on the evening of}} 16 October 1816, charged with having broken into a farm house and stealing a quantity of clothing, the property of Thomas Prest, some of which they had already sold. They were subsequently committed for trial at the Durham Assizes, which took place on 6 August 1817. They were found guilty of theft, but not of breaking and entering (which was then a capital offence) and sentenced to transportation for seven years. They were taken away to Woolwich, where they were incarcerated in a hulk named Justitia moored in the River Thames. They were taken aboard the Lady Castlereagh which around mid-December 1817 set sail for Australia, arriving at Port Jackson on 30 April 1818. Governor Macquarie would only allow thirty-nine prisoners to disembark, and ordered the captain to take the remaining 261 to Van Diemens Land, compensating the ship's owners for the change of plans. The two Solomon boys, who were among the latter contingent, were not model prisoners, and after committing a theft of clothes were on 3 March 1821 sent in irons to Newcastle, New South Wales for three years, shortly before its dismemberment as a penal settlement. The boys received their <b>Certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>Release</b> in Sydney in August 1824.|$|R
5000|$|This {{is not a}} [...] "veterans {{discount}} card".

There are also membership cards issued by various veteran's groups, including the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans (DAV) and the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). Many people use their DD214 (<b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Release</b> or Discharge from Active Duty) for identification.|$|E
50|$|A Certificate of Airworthiness (CofA), or an {{airworthiness}} certificate, {{is issued}} for an aircraft {{by the national}} aviation authority {{in the state in}} which the aircraft is registered. The airworthiness certificate attests that the aircraft is airworthy insofar as the aircraft conforms to its type design. Each airworthiness certificate is issued in {{one of a number of}} different categories. A certificate of airworthiness is issued when the aircraft is registered in the name of the owner. Thereafter, a yearly currency fee is payable to renew the Certificate of Airworthiness. If this fee is not paid when due, the certificate expires and the owner must apply again for this certificate to be issued. The Certificate of Airworthiness can only be issued when a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> to service from the maintenance facility declares that the maintenance due has been carried out and the aircraft is then certified as being airworthy.|$|E
5000|$|He swore Shady was {{his real}} first name. He also {{claimed that he}} was {{the only member of the}} {{legislature}} who could prove that he was legally sane since he had spent some time in a mental institute and had a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> to prove his soundness of mind[...] [...] [...] He had dabbled in real estate, advertising, and 'investments', and he had married well and become the president of a bank in West Monroe. He loved guns and firearms and kept a cache of them in his apartment at the Pentagon Barracks adjacent to the Capitol. He reportedly had a bowl of hand grenades displayed on a dining room table like a still life display of fruit. He had also reportedly fired a pistol at an unnamed representative who made the mistake of incurring his ire. It seems this colleague and several others were playing a childish prank on Shady one night and got caught. They were fleeing the scene when Shady opened fire. Luckily, he missed. No one is quite sure whether that was intentional.|$|E
5000|$|The funeral {{procession}} was held early on 1 September, {{with photographs of}} Ali both before he died and of his dead body covering the coffin. It had already been delayed for some hours, as Ali's father was unwilling to sign the death <b>certificate</b> for <b>release</b> <b>of</b> his son's body, since {{the cause of death}} listed was stated to be [...] "unknown". It is uncertain if the certificate was ever signed or if the body was just released.|$|R
40|$|Public key {{infrastructure}} {{has been}} proposed as a promising foundation for verifying the authenticity of communicating parties and transferring trust over the internet. One of the key issues in public key infrastructure is how to manage certificate revocations. Various technical solutions dealing with key revocation have been proposed. However, {{to the best of}} our best knowledge, no rigorous efforts have been made to understand the behavior <b>of</b> <b>certificate</b> revocation requests based on empirical data. Furthermore, there is no study on the managerial aspect <b>of</b> <b>Certificate</b> Revocation <b>Release.</b> In this study, based on the empirical data collected from VeriSign, we prove that a revocation system will become stable after a period of time. We show that different certificate authorities should take different strategies for <b>releasing</b> different types <b>of</b> <b>certificate</b> revocations. We also provide the exact steps by which certificate authorities can follow to derive optima...|$|R

At {{the end of}} April 2013 the locomotive was transported to the experimental track near Żmigrod Railway Institute where the testing on the locomotive began. On the 16 May 2013 locomotive together with two carriages began being used PKP Intercity in Nowy Sacz, and in the following days the locomotive was tested at the Olsztyn - Nidzica railway line (where the turning of the locomotive was tested). The locomotive returned {{to the south of}} the country of Poland, where at the beginning of June 2013 had passed the static tests at the Kraków Railway Institute, then the locomotive went to Żmigród.

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} process of redesign and installation of new avionics equipment in the cockpit of a Pilatus PC- 6 Turbo Porter, with registration EC-LZI. This redesign consists on install, remove and replace avionics equipment in the cockpit on the aircraft, in particular, communications and navigation equipment. Specifically, it is explained {{from the point of}} view of an approved maintenance organization, to which a customer entrusts this work, how to carry out the modification and how to certify it to the authorities. This process will require a major change in the electrical system of the aircraft, so it will be a complex installation. The cockpit design change is motivated by the Single European Sky initiative, which says that all the aircraft flying in European airspace must have installed communications equipment with a 8, 33 kHz channel spacing, before December 31 st 2017 and all aircraft flying with Mode S transponder in near future. Taking advantage that the aircraft will be a must stop for installation time, other equipment such as, a new attitude indicator or a power socket for portable devices are installed. The process of redesign and installation has a first stage of obtaining permits and documentation from the competent authority. Then, there is a second stage of wiring manufacturing and subsequent installation of the equipment onto the aircraft. Finally, it becomes {{the process of}} certification of the whole installation in order to issue a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Release</b> to Service, which ensures that all the installation has been installed properly and that the airplane can fly safely again. All processes are carried out under the current regulations, documentation and permits to do so...|$|E
