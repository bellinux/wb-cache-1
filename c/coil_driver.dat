40|$|Wireless power {{transfer}} (WPT) via magnetic induction is an emerging {{technology that is}} a result of the significant advancements in power electronics. Mobiles phones can now be charged wirelessly by placing them on a charging surface. Electric vehicles can charge their batteries while being parked over a certain charging spot. The possible applications of this technology are vast and the potential it has to revolutionise and change the way that we use today’s application is huge. Wireless {{power transfer}} via magnetic induction, also referred to as inductive power transfer (IPT), does not necessarily aim to replace the cable. It is intended to coexist and operate in conjunction with the cable. Although significant progress has been achieved, it is still far from reaching this aim since many obstacles and design challenges still need to be addressed. Low power efficiencies and limited transfer range are the two main issues for IPT. A tradeoff is usually associated with these two issues. Higher efficiencies are only achieved at very short transmission distances, whereas transferring large amounts of power at large distances is possible but at reduced efficiencies. This thesis addressed the limitations and design challenges in IPT systems such as low efficiency and short transmission range, in addition to poor power regulation and coil displacement and misalignment sensitivity. Novel circuit topologies and design solutions have developed for DC/AC inverters and DC/AC rectifiers that will allow for increased performance, higher efficiencies and reduced sensitivity to coil misalignments and displacements. This thesis contributes in four key areas towards IPT. Firstly, a detailed mathematical analysis has been performed on the electric circuit model of inductively coupled coils. This allows for better understanding on how power is distributed amongst the circuit’s elements. Equivalent circuit representations were presented to simplify the design process of IPT systems. Secondly, a review of the different classes and configurations of DC/AC inverters that can be used as primary <b>coil</b> <b>drivers</b> in IPT systems were presented. Class E DC/AC inverters were mathematically analysed in great detail and their performance as primary <b>coil</b> <b>drivers</b> in IPT systems was investigated. Thirdly, novel electronic tuning methods were presented to allow Class E primary <b>coil</b> <b>drivers</b> to operate at optimum switching conditions regardless of the distance between the coils of an IPT system and the value of the load. The saturable reactor was used as the electronic tunable element. Lastly, Class D and Class E AC/DC rectifiers have been used for the first time in IPT systems. Detailed mathematical analysis and extensive experimental results show their superior performance over the conventional half-wave and full-wave AC/DC rectifiers...|$|R

5000|$|The singing Tesla coil, {{sometimes}} called a zeusaphone, thoramin or musical lightning, {{is a form}} of plasma speaker. It is a variation of a solid state Tesla coil that has been modified to produce musical tones by modulating its spark output. The resulting pitch is a low fidelity square wave like sound reminiscent of an analog synthesizer. The high-frequency signal acts in effect as a carrier wave; its frequency is significantly above human-audible sound frequencies, so that digital modulation can reproduce a recognizable pitch. The musical tone results directly from the passage of the spark through the air. Because solid-state <b>coil</b> <b>drivers</b> are limited to [...] "on-off" [...] modulation, the sound produced consists of square-like waveforms rather than sinusoidal (though simple chords are possible).|$|R

40|$|The {{misalignment}} and {{displacement of}} inductively coupled coils in a {{wireless power transfer}} system (WPT) can degrade the power efﬁciency and limit the amount of power that can be transferred.

This paper presents a novel method to electronically tune a Class E inverter used as a primary <b>coil</b> <b>driver</b> in an inductive WPT system to minimize the detrimental effects of misalignment between the inductively coupled coils which may occur during operation. The tuning method uses current controlled inductors (saturable reactors) and a variable switching frequency to achieve optimum switching conditions regardless of the misalignment.

40|$|The {{refractive}} index of air varies a. o. with temperature, humidity, {{pressure and the}} CO 2 concentration. Due to atmospheric turbulence this {{refractive index}} varies both in space and in time, leading to aberrations in images of light having passed though it. These aberrations limit the achievable resolution of optical telescopes such {{that the quality of}} their images is no longer diffraction limited. An adaptive optics (AO) system is a means to recover the diffraction limited quality of the images. This can be achieved a. o. by reflecting the incoming light on a deformable mirror (DM) that adapts its shape to the wavefront of this light such that some norm of the residual wavefront after reflection is minimal. In this thesis novel designs are considered for the DM and its control system. They are primarily aimed at the 8 m class of telescopes in visible light, leading to a 200 Hz controller bandwidth requirement and 6 mm actuator spacing or 5000 actuators on a 500 mm diameter DM [...] To observe fainter celestial objects and/or increase the image resolution, optical telescopes are foreseen with primary mirrors of up to 40 m in diameter. Therefore, the DM system design is aimed at extendibility to a larger number of Degrees Of Freedom (DOF), which is realized using a modular concept. Other drivers are low power consumption to prevent the need for active cooling systems and low production costs. The DM design is realized using electromagnetic reluctance type actuators that are connected to the DM's reflective membrane by a thin rod. Modules containing 61 hexagonally arranged actuators are manufactured using techniques suitable for mass-production. To generate the currents through the actuator <b>coils,</b> <b>driver</b> electronics are developed based on Pulse-Width Modulation (implemented in FPGAs) in combination with analog low-pass filters. Several prototype DMs are realized whose behavior is analyzed both statically and dynamically by comparing Wyko and laser vibrometer measurements with first principle models of the driver electronics, the actuators and the facesheet. To retain modularity of the system, a distributed control system architecture is foreseen in which each (group of) actuator(s) has its own controller that has a fixed computational power, communicates only to its neighbors and receives only a subset of the wavefront measurement data. The design of a distributed controller with good performance is complicated by the wavefront reconstruction step made necessary by the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. Nevertheless, a distributed algorithm that combines wavefront reconstruction with adaptive prediction is shown in simulation to approximate the performance of a centralized finite impulse response (FIR) predictor/reconstructor and does not deteriorate as the number of DOFs increases.

This section describes the overall engineering approach, {{as well as some of}} the technical details that brought us to the present design. In general, an array of sensor coils is measuring the signal generated by the UXO object in response to a stimulation provided by the <b>driver</b> <b>coil.</b> The information related to the location, shape and properties of the object is derived from the analysis of the measured data. Each sensor coil is instrumented with a waveform digitizer operating at a nominal digitization rate of 100 kSamples per second. The sensor coils record both the large transient pulse of the <b>driver</b> <b>coil</b> and the UXO object response pulse. The latter is smaller in amplitude and must be extracted from the large transient signal. The resolution required is 16 bits over a dynamic range of at least 140 dB. The useful signal bandwidth of the application extends from DC to 40 kHz. The low distortion of each component is crucial in order to maintain an excellent linearity over the full dynamic range and to minimize the calibration procedure. The electronics must be made as compact as possible so that the response of its metallic parts has a minimum signature response. Also because of a field system portability requirement, the power consumption of the instrument must be kept as low as possible.
