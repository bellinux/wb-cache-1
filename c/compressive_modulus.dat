A high resilience indicate that an sufficient amount of energy input {{can be stored in}} the material, and released afterwards. An example of energy input is to stretch the material. Natural resilin (hydrated) has a resilience of 92%, which means it can store 92% of the energy input for release during unloading, indicating a very efficient energy transfer. In order for a better understanding the stiffness and strain of resilin, Hooke’s Law should be taken into consideration. For linear springs, Hooke’s Law states that the force required to deform the spring is directly proportional to the amount of deformation by a constant which is the characteristic of the spring. A material is viewed as elastic when it can be deformed to a large extend with a limited amount of force.

40|$|The {{objective}} of our paper {{was to determine}} the effects of composite formulation on the <b>compressive</b> <b>modulus</b> and ultimate strength of a biodegradable, in situ polymerizable poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF) and bone fiber scaffold. The following parameters were investigated: the incorporation of bone fibers (either mineralized or demineralized), PPF molecular weight, N-vinyl pyrrolidinone (NVP) crosslinker amount, benzoyl peroxide (BP) initiator amount, and sodium chloride porogen amount. Eight formulations were chosen based on a resolution III two-level fractional factorial design. The <b>compressive</b> <b>modulus</b> and ultimate strength of these formulations were measured on a materials testing machine. Absolute values for <b>compressive</b> <b>modulus</b> varied from 21. 3 to 271 &#x 2009;MPa and 2. 8 to 358 &#x 2009;MPa for dry and wet samples, respectively. The ultimate strength of the crosslinked composites varied from 2. 1 to 20. 3 &#x 2009;MPa for dry samples and from 0. 4 to 16. 6 &#x 2009;MPa for wet samples. Main effects of each parameter on the measured property were calculated. The incorporation of mineralized bone fibers and an increase in PPF molecular weight resulted in higher <b>compressive</b> <b>modulus</b> and ultimate strength. Both mechanical properties also increased as the amount of benzoyl peroxide increased or the NVP amount decreased in the formulation. Sodium chloride had a dominating effect on the increase of mechanical properties in dry samples but showed little effects in wet samples.
