40|$|ABSTRACT: On {{concrete}} dam construction work, {{it is necessary}} to manufacture a large amount of concrete and CSG (Cemented Sand and Gravel). The manufacture plant of concrete and CSG is operated in very long term, therefore the effect of its environmental impact could be serious. In general, {{there are two types of}} manufacture plant on the process of manufacturing concrete or CSG. The one is batch type plant; its mixing process is not continuous and {{it is necessary to}} repeat the processes of measuring and mixing every batch. The other is continuous mixing plant; mixing process is completely continuous, at the same time, the measurement and supplement of materials are also carried out continuously. Since <b>continuous</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>plant</b> can manufacture a large amount of products at short time, <b>continuous</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>plant</b> is suitable for manufacture plant of {{concrete dam}} construction. But it is hard to control the quality of products, so batch type plant used to be adopted as the mixer of the manufacture plant. In recent years, the new <b>continuous</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>plant</b> which can control the quality of products accurately has developed and been put to practical use on several projects of concrete and CSG dam construction. The best feature of this plant is its energy saving effect. This plant is equipped with a static continuous mixer for mixing concrete or CSG. This mixer is set up in vertical direction, and then it is possible to mix materials with no electric power but only by gravity force. In this study, environmental impact due to manufacture concrete and CSG by conventional batch type plant and new <b>continuous</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>plant</b> are estimated and compared, and then the advantage of new continues mixing plant for environment is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{research}} project is to construct and evaluate several bituminous concrete base overlays with various high penetration bituminous products which {{have the potential to}} reduce future maintenance and construction costs. In September of 1981 nine different bituminous test sections were constructed on Osceola County roads A- 34 and A- 46 east of Ashton. Asphalt binders used were AC- 5 asphalt cement, SC- 800 liquid asphalt, MC- 3000 cutback asphalt, CSS- 1 emulsion and HFMS- 2 emulsion. Aggregate for four of the test sections consisted of salvaged bituminous pavement and new aggregate combined. Each section was road mixed using a different binder arid placed 2 - 1 / 4 " thick with a motor patrol. The other five test sections consisted of an AC- 5 Type B asphalt concrete control section and four plant-mixed, cold-laid bituminous concrete overlay sections using new aggregate. The material was <b>mixed</b> in a <b>continuous</b> drum <b>mix</b> <b>plant</b> and laid with a full width paver...|$|R
40|$|Hot mix asphalt (HMA) paving {{materials}} are {{a mixture of}} size-graded, high quality aggregate (which can include reclaimed asphalt pavement [RAP]), and liquid asphalt cement, which is heated and mixed in measured quantities to produce HMA. Aggregate and RAP (if used) constitute over 92 percent by weight of the total mixture. Aside from the amount and grade of asphalt cement used, mix characteristics {{are determined by the}} relative amounts and types of aggregate and RAP used. A certain percentage of fine aggregate (less than 74 micrometers [µm] in physical diameter) is required for the production of good quality HMA. Hot mix asphalt {{paving materials}} can be manufactured by: (1) batch <b>mix</b> <b>plants,</b> (2) <b>continuous</b> <b>mix</b> (mix outside dryer drum) plants, (3) parallel flow drum <b>mix</b> <b>plants,</b> and (4) counterflow drum <b>mix</b> <b>plants.</b> This order of listing generally reflects the chronological order of development and use within the HMA industry. In 1996, approximately 500 million tons of HMA were produced at the 3, 600 (estimated) active asphalt plants in the United States. Of these 3, 600 plants, approximately 2, 300 are batch plants, 1, 000 are parallel flow drum <b>mix</b> <b>plants,</b> and 300 are counterflow drum <b>mix</b> <b>plants.</b> The total 1996 HMA production from batch and drum <b>mix</b> <b>plants</b> is estimated at about 240 million tons and 260 million tons...|$|R

40|$|A <b>continuous</b> <b>mix</b> pilot <b>plant</b> was {{constructed}} at Aerojet Propulsion Division in Sacramento, California {{to develop a}} robust propellant mixing process for the full scale plant {{that was to be}} built at the NASA Advanced Solid Rocket Motor facility Yellow Creek, Mississippi. The plant was used to conduct dozens of subsystem and full system mixing tests for evaluation of equipment, processing methods, and control schemes for later use at the production plant. As a culmination to this work, a series of designed experiments were conducted using an eight run Taguchi analysis with four factors at two levels each to determine the primary effect of processing parameters on propellant ballistic and mechanical properties. The factors examined in these runs included the propellant production rate (454 (1000) and 622 kg/hr (1371 Ib/hr)), the product temperature out of the mixer (49 (120) and 63 deg C (145 deg F)), mixer screw speed (75 and 90 rpm), and the deaerator excess capacity (20 and 80 percent). Measured response variables included the uncured and cured density, Crawford Bomb liquid strand burning rates, and selected mechanical properties. The experiment revealed that several of the response variables displayed significant changes from run-to-run with the product temperature being the single most important factor. After concluding this experiment, a twenty-six hour confirmation run was conducted to verify the conclusions reached in the designed experiment. The extended run produced over 12, 250 kgs (27, 000 lbs) of propellant meeting all of the pre-run targeted properties including density (1. 803 g/cc (0. 065 lb/in(exp 3)) with a 0. 12 percent coefficient of variation (CV) at 25 deg C (77 deg F)), liquid strand burn rate (0. 889 cm/s (0. 350 in/s) with a 0. 69 percent CV at 4210 KPa (610 psig), 15. 6 deg C (60 deg F)), nominal maximum stress (828 KPa (120 psig) with a 2. 84 percent CV, S&E at 25 deg C (77 deg F), 5. 08 cm/min (2 in/min)), strain at nominal maximum (47. 4 percent with a 3. 96 percent CV), and initial tangent modulus (5349 KPa (775 psig) with a 7. 26 percent CV) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{continuously}} mixed, aseptic {{paddle mixer}} was used successfully for solid-state fermentation (SSF) with Aspergillus oryzae on whole wheat kernels. <b>Continuous</b> <b>mixing</b> improved temperature control and prevented inhomogeneities in the bed. Respiration rates {{found in this}} system were comparable to those in small, isothermal, unmixed beds, which showed that <b>continuous</b> <b>mixing</b> did not cause serious damage to the fungus or the wheat kernels. <b>Continuous</b> <b>mixing</b> improves heat transport to the bioreactor wall, which reduces the need for evaporative cooling and thus may help to prevent the desiccation problems that hamper large-scale SSF. However, scale-up calculations for the paddle mixer indicated that wall cooling becomes insufficient at the 2 -m 3 scale for a rapidly growing fungus like Aspergillus oryzae. Consequently, evaporative cooling will remain important in large-scale mixed systems. Experiments showed that water addition will be necessary when evaporative cooling is applied {{in order to maintain}} a sufficiently high water activity of the solid substrate. Mixing is necessary to ensure homogeneous water addition in SSF. Automated process control might be achieved using the enthalpy balance. The enthalpy balance for the case of evaporative cooling in the paddle mixer was validated. This work shows that <b>continuous</b> <b>mixing</b> provides promising possibilities for simultaneous control of temperature and moisture content in solid-state fermentation on a large scale...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFlash floods, erratically {{striking}} semi-arid regions, often cause field {{flooding and}} soil anoxia, resulting in crop losses on food staples, typically pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). Recent glasshouse {{studies have indicated}} that rice (Oryza spp.) can enhance flood stress tolerance of co-growing dryland cereals by modifying their rhizosphere microenvironments via the oxygen released from its roots into the aqueous rhizosphere. We tested whether this phenomenon would be expressed under field flood conditions. The effects of mix-planting of pearl millet and sorghum with rice on their survival, growth and grain yields were evaluated under controlled field flooding in semi-arid Namibia during 2014 / 2015 – 2015 / 2016. Single-stand and <b>mixed</b> <b>plant</b> treatments were subjected to 11 – 22 day flood stress at the vegetative growth stage. <b>Mixed</b> <b>planting</b> increased plant survival rates in both pearl millet and sorghum. Grain yields of pearl millet and sorghum were reduced by flooding, in both the single-stand and <b>mixed</b> <b>plant</b> treatments, relative to the non-flooded upland yields, but the reduction was lower in the <b>mixed</b> <b>plant</b> treatments. In contrast, flooding increased rice yields. Both pearl millet–rice and sorghum–rice mixtures demonstrated higher land equivalent ratios, indicating a <b>mixed</b> <b>planting</b> advantage under flood conditions. These results indicate that mix-planting pearl millet and sorghum with rice could alleviate flood stress on dryland cereals. The results also suggest that with this cropping technique, rice could compensate for the dryland cereal yield losses due to field flooding...|$|R
