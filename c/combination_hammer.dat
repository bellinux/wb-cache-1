40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study effects of grinding and pelleting on feed structure using either wheat or maize as a base ingredients. In experiment 1, four diets were formulated to contain either completely ground base ingredients using 3 mm and 6 mm screen size in hammer mill or base ingredients were added as whole grain in ration of 30 % whole grain 70 % ground material. In addition base ingredients were mixed with mineral and vitamin premix to make complete diets. Smaller particles improved pellet durability but replacement of ground ingredients with whole ingredinets increased hardness. Coarse structure of the diets reduced energy consumption when compared with fine structured diets.

40|$|This study {{compares the}} results of {{measurements}} and physical modeling of the string vibrations in three common musical instruments: the guitar, the piano, and the violin. The string vibrations are determined by three major conditions: {{the properties of the}} string, the boundary conditions at the end supports, and the excitation (plucking, striking, or bowing). Simulating the string vibrations by means of a discrete model on a computer provides a powerful method for evaluating the importance of each of these conditions. In general, the numerical simulations and the measurements showed a close agreement. As for the guitar, the resonances of the guitar body was modelled with 66 resonances in the frequency range 0 - 5 kHz. It was found that the dominating resonance of the guitar body influences the string vibrations shortly after, but not during, the attack. This influence could also be perceived in listening tests. For the piano, the nonlinearity of the piano hammer was included. This allowed a realistic modeling of the force history between hammer and string, and different <b>combinations</b> of <b>hammer</b> properties and dynamic levels were simulated. Also in this case, calculated waveforms and spectra agreed well. Attempts of simulating the bowed string indicated that the discrete model also could be adapted to a continuous driving force.

40|$|Hallandsås Project, {{carried out}} by Skanska-Vinci, {{concerns}} the construction of two 8. 7 km long railway tunnels in Southern Sweden. These tunnels have been excavated {{with the use of}} Tunnel Borring Machine(TBM). The excavation of the East Tunnel brought some significant delays due to high discharge water quantities within a Lya Zone. Therefore, prior to the excavation through the Lya Zone within the West Tunnel, special pre-treatment was designed to avoid time and cost consuming grouting works from the TBM. This pre-treatment concerned long-hole grouting, performed from Cross Tunnels no. 5 and 6, sealing the rock masses within specified pattern. This dissertation aims evaluation of two drilling methods used during the pre-treatment works in Lya Zone: Mudmotor and Wassara Hammer. The practical experience was gained during training period in the Hallandsås Project from September 2012 until February 2013. This knowledge was completed with studies about theoretical applying of the rock drilling methods. Two parameters were used in order to compare these two rock drilling methods: drilling time and deviation of the boreholes. Drilling time was presented from two perspectives. Firstly, the evaluation of the rate of penetration assigned to the specified sections pointed that Wassara Hammer provides much higher rate than Mudmotor. Moreover comparison of drilling time within each borehole show significant increase of drilling speed during Wassara Hammer application. The rate of performance was calculated to be almost 4 time higher for Wassara. Deviation was introduced in two different approaches as well. On the one hand, deviated boreholes were shown within particular sections, significant tendency in horizontal deviation towards left was shown. Deviation average values have been decreasing while advancing the steering proccess, however, some significant correction was observed only in case of horizontal deviation. On another hand, evaluation of the deviation within borehole GH 11 brought the assumption that the borehole’s steering did not performed exactly during Mudmotor application. Mudmotor gave a direction for further drilling, and due to this, correction of the borehole was observed during Wassara drilling. It was originally assumed that the use of these two rock drilling methods together may result in effective performance. This research attempted to evaluate Mudmotor and Wassara Hammer technologies and show the efficiency of such <b>combination.</b> Wassara <b>Hammer</b> provided fast drilling proccess while minimal deviation was possible due to the use of Mudmotor...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic/sonic rotary-hammer drill (USRoHD) is {{a recent}} {{addition}} to the collection of apparatuses based on ultrasonic/sonic drill corer (USDC). As described below, the USRoHD has several features, not present in a basic USDC, that increase efficiency and provide some redundancy against partial failure. USDCs and related apparatuses were conceived for boring into, and/or acquiring samples of, rock or other hard, brittle materials of geological interest. They have been described in numerous previous NASA Tech Briefs articles. To recapitulate: A USDC {{can be characterized as}} a lightweight, lowpower, piezoelectrically driven jackhammer in which ultrasonic and sonic vibrations are generated and coupled to a tool bit. A basic USDC includes a piezoelectric stack, an ultrasonic transducer horn connected to the stack, a free mass (free {{in the sense that it}} can bounce axially a short distance between hard stops on the horn and the bit), and a tool bit. The piezoelectric stack creates ultrasonic vibrations that are mechanically amplified by the horn. The bouncing of the free mass between the hard stops generates the sonic vibrations. The combination of ultrasonic and sonic vibrations gives rise to a hammering action (and a resulting chiseling action at the tip of the tool bit) that is more effective for drilling than is the microhammering action of ultrasonic vibrations alone. The hammering and chiseling actions are so effective that unlike in conventional twist drilling, little applied axial force is needed to make the apparatus advance into the material of interest. There are numerous potential applications for USDCs and related apparatuses in geological exploration on Earth and on remote planets. In early USDC experiments, it was observed that accumulation of cuttings in a drilled hole causes the rate of penetration of the USDC to decrease steeply with depth, and that the rate of penetration can be increased by removing the cuttings. The USRoHD concept provides for removal of cuttings in the same manner as that of a twist drill: An USRoHD includes a USDC and a motor with gearhead (see figure). The USDC provides the bit hammering and the motor provides the bit rotation. Like a twist drill bit, the shank of the tool bit of the USRoHD is fluted. As in the operation of a twist drill, the rotation of the fluted drill bit removes cuttings from the drilled hole. The USRoHD tool bit is tipped with a replaceable crown having cutting teeth on its front surface. The teeth are shaped to promote fracturing of the rock face through a <b>combination</b> of <b>hammering</b> and rotation of the tool bit. Helical channels on the outer cylindrical surface of the crown serve as a continuation of the fluted surface of the shank, helping to remove cuttings. In the event of a failure of the USDC, the USRoHD can continue to operate with reduced efficiency as a twist drill. Similarly, in the event of a failure of the gearmotor, the USRoHD can continue to operate with reduced efficiency as a USDC...|$|R
5000|$|Alec Stone Sweet {{describes}} the clawhammer technique in the liner notes to [...] "Tumblin' Gap: Clawhammer Guitar Solos": [...] "There are five {{characteristics of the}} way I play clawhammer. First, every specific note played by the right hand is produced either by the index finger or the thumb. Second, no note is ever plucked; each is played either with the thumb, or by striking down on a string with the nail of the index finger. Third, the index finger never plays off the beat, and the thumb never plays on the beat. This feature of clawhammer technique gives the music a heavier - and, to my ear, more natural - drive {{than it would have}} if it were played, say, as melody over an alternating bass. There is one exception to this rule: variations on a common clawhammer banjo lick (that you can hear on the climatic high notes of the second part of Polly Put the Kettle On, and the third part of Joke on the Puppy) when the thumb plays on beat. Fourth, for any piece, most of the notes are produced by the left hand, in <b>combinations</b> of slides, <b>hammers,</b> and pull-offs; slurs can occur on or off the beat. Fifth, I play in multiple tunings, and sometimes replace the sixth string bass with a high sixth string treble (of the same gauge employed for the first string). The banjo player will realize that I use my thumb on the bass strings to obtain drones, much as a clawhammer player uses the banjo’s high fifth string; indeed, when I string the guitar with a high treble in place of the sixth-string bass, it is partly to imitate the fifth string of the banjo. In many of the tunes, I keep multiple drones going, on different strings. To sum up, in my version of clawhammer guitar, the thumb plays off the beat, even when it plays harmony bass notes or bass lines; no strings are ever plucked; with respect to the right hand, only the index finger and the thumb sound notes, but never at the same time. What is incredible is how much full textured sound one finger, one thumb, and left hand slurs can generate." ...|$|R
40|$|Vibration and {{cavitation}} can {{be generated}} in many ways and serve many useful purposes. This study describes physical aspects of useful vibration and cavitation for {{a broad spectrum of}} applications at atmospheric or elevated pressures. After a review of available devices, hydrodynamic vibrating-body-in-pipe tools as described in patents by Ivannikov are identified as having a major potential and being largely unexplored. Major advantages of these tools are simplicity of construction, scalability, powerful effects and attractive frequency range for well cleaning applications. Self induced vibration with a free body colliding with the pipe wall causes alternating flow around the body with a water hammer effect that enhances the vibration and cavitation. Cavitation can thus be generated at lower flow rates and at higher backpressures than with passive tools such as orifices. Cavitational collapse at high backpressure creates exceptionally strong effects, giving access to novel applications. At backpressures where even water hammer enhanced cavitation ceases to exist, very strong vibrations persist to pressure levels encountered in deep wells. This unique dual enhanced vibration and cavitation behaviour of the tools is the key to vibrating-body-in-pipe technology for which the new name VibroCav was coined. The study focuses on VibroCav tools with balls, except for one series of tests with a so-called flip-flop body. Exploratory tests in a 350 bar test circuit in Assen lead to the design of a 50 bar laboratory closed test circuit installed in the 3 ME lab in Delft with facilities to apply up to 10 bar backpressure and up to 40 bar pressure differentials over the tools. In the 50 bar test circuit many experiments were carried out, firstly with bottom supported balls in a straight pipe and secondly with hanging balls in a pipe with a conical outlet allowing remote adjustment of the gap between the ball and the pipe wall. The influence of water composition, gas content and various ball materials was tested. Selected high backpressure test were carried out with a 350 bar closed test circuit in Drachten. A total of 29 field trials on an industrial scale were carried out for cleaning the porous media around water and oil wellbores under widely varying conditions and 5 field trials were done to evaluate the potential of the technology for the removal of scale deposits in wellbores. The laboratory experiments with the 50 bar test circuit delineated various operational modes of the VibroCav tools as function of flow rate and backpressure with regimes designated as (i) vibration only, (ii) active cavitation always combined with vibration, (iii) no vibration and passive cavitation and (iv) no vibration and no passive cavitation. The vibration regime persists to the maximum backpressure that could be reached and probably to much higher pressures, however at high flow rate conditions and a narrow gap vibration ceases when the Re value increases beyond the point of drag reduction due to shifting of the boundary separation point (Re approximately 3 x 105 for unbounded flow). Active cavitation is just as passive cavitation subdued by increasing backpressure; but in this test circuit it has still been observed at a backpressure of 63 barg. With a bottom supported tool as used in this test circuit a significant path downstream of the ball is obscured and active cavitation closer to the gap might still exist. This is the basis for the expectation that for this tool active cavitation may survive up to 100 barg backpressure. Tools with a hanging ball, in which cavitation is more clearly visible, were not tested at such high backpressures. The influence of water quality and gas content proved to be insignificant. Lightweight balls showed in bottom supported tools violent vibration and strong active cavitation but were easily damaged by the high contact forces between the ball and the support. With hard steel balls and softer steel supports, bedding-in is observed due to contact forces beyond the elastic limit of the support. If the ball is softer than the support, the ball flattens, breaks or is otherwise damaged by the support. The field trials for cleaning porous media around wellbores combined with theoretical analysis provided valuable semi-quantitative understanding of the influence of frequency, source directivity, source energy, wellbore geometry and permeability damage on the penetration depth of sources for vibration based well cleaning. The most significant wave energy for cleaning porous media is provided by the slow Biot wave, which is a compressional wave in fluid in the interconnected pore network. The higher the virgin permeability of the rock and the lower the wave frequency the better is the penetration depth. Permeability deterioration due to pore fouling reduces the penetration depth of the cleaning treatment and with progressive fouling the pore damage may get out of reach of the cleaning tools. The limited number of scale removal trials showed significant potential of the VibroCav tools due to the <b>combination</b> of physical <b>hammering,</b> jetting, wave energy and shock waves of collapsing cavitation bubbles. The study provides a solid basis for a scientifically founded continuation of the development of VibroCav technology for many areas of application in several industrial sectors and should be regarded as the precursor for a range of innovating techniques. 3 MEMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
