Scrub is hand-cleared, but song posts and thickets are left for the breeding birds. The <b>cut-leaved</b> <b>germander</b> is encouraged by the creation of its preferred open-scree habitat, and this is fenced against disturbance by rabbits. The <b>cut-leaved</b> <b>germander</b> is fully protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act.|$|E
