40|$|To support NASA s planned 20 -year {{mission to}} provide {{sustained}} global precipitation measurement (EOS- 9 Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM)), a deployable antenna has been explored with an inflatable thin-membrane structure. This design uses a 5. 3 5. 3 -m inflatable parabolic reflector with the electronically scanned, dual-frequency phased array feeds to provide improved rainfall measurements at 2. 0 -km horizontal resolution over a cross-track scan range {{of up to}} 37, necessary for resolving intense, isolated storm cells and for reducing the beam-filling and spatial sampling errors. The two matched radar beams at the two frequencies (Ku and Ka bands) will allow unambiguous retrieval of the parameters in raindrop size distribution. The antenna is inflatable, using rigidizable booms, deployable chain-link supports with prescribed curvatures, a smooth, thin-membrane reflecting surface, and an offset feed technique to achieve the precision surface tolerance (0. 2 mm RMS) for meeting the low-sidelobe requirement. The cylindrical parabolic offset-feed reflector augmented with two linear phased array feeds achieves dual-frequency shared-aperture with wide-angle beam scanning and very low sidelobe level of - 30 dB. Very long Ku and Ka band microstrip feed arrays incorporating a combination of parallel and series power divider lines with cosine-over-pedestal distribution also augment the sidelobe level and beam scan. This design reduces antenna mass and launch vehicle stowage volume. The Ku and Ka band feed arrays are needed to achieve the required cross-track beam scanning. To demonstrate the inflatable cylindrical reflector with two linear polarizations (V and H), and two beam directions (0 deg and 30 deg), each frequency band has four individual microstrip array designs. The Ku-band array has a total of 166 x 2 elements and the Ka-band has 166 x 4 elements with both bands having element spacing about 0. 65 lambda(sub 0). The cylindrical reflector with offset linear array feeds reduces the complexity from "NxN" transmit/receive (T/R) modules of a conventional planar-phased array to just "N" T/R modules. The antenna uses T/R modules with electronic phase-shifters for beam steering. The offset reflector does not provide poor cross-polarization like a double- <b>curved</b> <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> would, and it allows the wide scan angle in one plane required by the mission. Also, the cylindrical reflector with two linear array feeds provides dual-frequency performance with a single, shared aperture. The aperture comprises a reflective surface with a focal length of 1. 89 m and is made from aluminized Kapton film. The reflective surface is of uniform thickness {{in the range of}} a few thousandths of an inch and is attached to the chain-link support structure via an adjustable suspension system. The film aperture rolls up, together with the chain-link structure, for launch and can be deployed in space by the deployment of the chain-link structure...|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} the {{performance}} of the hard horn antennas in a cluster-fed <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> system operating in the Ka-band (20 - 30 GHz) is analyzed. The analysis is done with a program that uses aperture integration to find the far-field of the antenna system. The results for different positions of the feed antenna in the <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> system are compared with results obtained for a rotationally symmetric antenna with the same diameter and a focused feed (BOR 1 approximation). The results show a good agreement for the focused feeds and some differences as the feed is displaced from the focal point. Several improvements of the reflector design are proposed and analyzed. It is concluded that the BOR 1 approximation is a powerful tool when designing a cluster-fed <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> system. Especially in the initial stage it gives the possibility to test a large number of different reflector designs.

40|$|Parabolic {{symmetric}} and <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> antennas adaptively illuminated using a novel triple-mode feedhorn (TE 11 +TM 01 +TE 21) {{with different}} mode combinations and impedance and radiation performances are presented. The {{combination of the}} radiating modes in a feedhorn with proper amplitude and fixed phase values helps in electronically pointing the main beam of the radiating patterns such as that obtained in a beam-steering antenna with limited beam-scan range. This type of radiation performance virtually creates a displaced phase center location for the feedhorn, which, consequently, adaptively illuminates the reflector antenna surface. Impedance-matching bandwidths are preserved for both reflector antennas similar {{to the case of}} feedhorn alone. The copolarization gain and peak cross-polarization levels are far better with the <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> antenna than the symmetric reflector antenna.

40|$|Analysis are {{presented}} {{for the current}} distribution {{and its effects on}} the radiated fields from any portion of the parabolic reflector, using a generalized feed source. The feed is formed of co-polarized electric and magnetic sources, with a given directivity towards the reflector surface. The mixture ratio between the electric and magnetic sources is examined with a view to minimize the cross-polarized radia-tion. This ratio is dependent on the reflector configuration. While {{it is well known that}} cross-polarized cur-rents vanish when the electric and magnetic moments of the feed are equal in symmetric reflectors, no comprehensive analyses are available for offset configurations. Therefore, in this work generalized rigor-ous analyses are given to specially accommodate <b>offset</b> <b>reflectors,</b> which are widely used in modem tele-communication systems. Cross-polarized currents of <b>offset</b> <b>reflectors</b> could only be minimized. Feed pointing would be lower than the reflector center (mid way between this center and the vertex). Also, the feed source should be predominantly electric for vertical polarization and predominantly magnetic for horizontal polarization.

Given a planar parametric curve C(t) and an offset radius Y, the circle of radius Y is first approximated by piecewise quadratic BCzier curve segments within the tolerance t.

30|$|A well-designed {{reflector}} {{surface with}} high beam pointing accuracy in electromagnetic performance is of practical {{significance to the}} space application of cable mesh reflector antennas. As for space requirements, circular polarizations are widely used in spaceborne antennas, which usually lead to a beam shift for <b>offset</b> <b>reflectors</b> and influence the beam pointing accuracy. A two-step structural design procedure is proposed to overcome the beam squint phenomenon for high beam pointing accuracy design of circularly polarized <b>offset</b> cable mesh <b>reflectors.</b> A simple structural optimal design and an integrated structural electromagnetic optimization are combined to alleviate the beam squint effect of circular polarizations.

A circularly polarized <b>offset</b> cable mesh <b>reflector</b> is utilized to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed procedure.

40|$|Antenna {{characterisation}} and radar {{cross section}} measurements can be conveniently and successfully carried out {{by means of a}} compact antenna test range (CATR), whose performance is primarily assessed in terms of quiet zone size and field uniformity. CATR characterisation and diagnostics are usually performed by means of (amplitude and phase) field measurements in the quiet zone and are of timely interest either on CATR installation or on its periodic reassessments performed by manufacturers and/or users. This paper addresses CATR characterisation from amplitude-only data, an attractive topic because of the application of CATRs to the millimetre or sub-millimetre wave ranges. The approach is based on an appropriate strategy retrieving the missing quiet zone phase and facing the issue of the large electrical dimensions of the CATR. To take into account the characteristics of the collimating system as well as to keep as low as possible the number of unknowns to be sought for, it exploits the Jacobi-Bessel expansion of the aperture field. The performance of the algorithm has been tested through a wide numerical analysis against synthetic data generated by GRASP 8 -SE whose full version is routinely employed for CATR design. The main results related to a Gregorian dual <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> CATR, modelled on that proposed in the literature by Pistorius et ah, and to a single <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> CATR, inspired by the one available at the Queen Mary & Westfield College, London (UK), are reported...|$|R
