After that, Michael Clarke (117) and David Warner (100) batted together for more than thirty overs, adding 184 runs for the third wicket, and Warner scoring a century {{for the second consecutive}} match. From the strong platform of 2/232 after 43 overs, Australia failed to accelerate at the death, scoring only 39 runs from the last seven overs to set a total of 6/271; Lasith Malinga (3/40) took 3/13 from his last three overs of the innings.

This model takes advantage of a set of relationships established between the members and requires the strategic role of a leading-governing actor that fosters the diffusion of cooperative behavior. In districts’ start-up the governing-promoter actor can play a significant role, since it has the role of <b>catching</b> <b>opportunities</b> and of creating them through the use and valorization of partners’ resources and capabilities. This process is also based on the relational capabilities within the district as well as on the capability of creating new ones...|$|R
500|$|He {{was praised}} by Larwood, who spearheaded the Bodyline attack and totalled 10/128 for the match, {{which ended in}} a decisive 10-wicket victory for England. Wisden {{reported}} that McCabe [...] "scored off Larwood's bowling in a style which for daring and brilliance was not approached by any other Australian during the tour". Richard Whitington wrote in the 1970s that McCabe's innings [...] "still warms {{the blood of the}} dwindling number of Australians who watched it". McCabe received a thunderous standing ovation from the 46,000 spectators. Immediately after the innings, McCabe told his teammates that he {{would never be able to}} replicate the feat because it was too difficult to hook the ball consistently without hitting it up into the air and giving away <b>catching</b> <b>opportunities.</b>|$|R

The catching up process {{can no longer be}} disentangled from the rapid internationalization of science and technology and the globalization of innovation, in which the developing countries have an increasingly important role to play. In the first section, we focus on setting the global scene within which the catching up process operates today. In a second section we study the increasing complexity in the knowledge creation process caused by this dynamic interaction between the global and local levels. We then introduce the relevant types of capacities and explain why different capabilities are required in specific situations, times and locations. In section four, we place these theoretical discussions in a Latin American context to understand <b>catching</b> up <b>opportunities</b> from a regional perspective, focusing on activities based on natural resources...|$|R

40|$|Second life (henceforward, SL) has {{captured}} the interest of many scholars and practitioners. Indeed, the entrance of many real world companies, attracted by the potentialities of Virtual Worlds (henceforward, VWs), has been interpreted as the signal for the discovery of new web-based business models. Therefore, in this work, we address the topic of how VWs, and SL in detail, can impact on the business models of the firms. In doing so, {{we are going to}} examine the literature about business models and VWs, in order to define how they interact each other. As a result, we propose a mapping framework able to support companies in determining the characteristics of VWs able to impact on business models. The major findings of this work, which is a work-in-progress relatively to VWs and business models studies, aims to determine which aspects of the former may affect the latter. In particular, we identified three main valuable areas: gaining new sources of value, <b>catching</b> the <b>opportunities</b> raised by a co-opetitive environment and finally extending the market to the V-commerce...|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} currency market Forex, provides interesting opportunities {{in terms of}} wealth. Open twenty {{four hours a day}} and five days a week, the market provides a large number of currency pairs to trade. The capacity of manual Forex trader decreases in terms of decision making, depending on time spent in front of the computer, when monitoring the market for <b>catching</b> trading <b>opportunities.</b> It is also impossible to monitor more than two currency pairs. These are two of many other challenges faced by manual Forex traders. The automation solve these kind of problems and many more. However, to trade the market is complex and challenging to be automated. Therefore, this thesis aims to investigate ways of designing efficient Forex trading robots by identifying the challenges faced by designers and finding possible solutions to overcome the identified challenges. In addition to a related work literature, this qualitative study used interviews with professionals in the fields of economy, applied mathematics to economy, computer science and users. The results of this thesis identified Forex strategy related challenges and robot environment related challenges. In the first category, coming up with profitable trading system, forecasting the Forex market and switching between different strategies are the major identified challenges. In the second category, broker behavior control, the stability of the system and time constraints are the identified challenges. In robots using fundamental analysis, the suggested solution to forecast the Forex market is based on linear optimization and forecasting, combined with genetic algorithms while robots using technical analysis, the optimization of combined indicators is encouraged to be followed, for better design. Testing a trading system in available Forex platform simulators using historical data give reliability on the trading system's expected results. The identified challenges will help software engineers as guideline to design a more efficient Forex trading robot. Key Words - Challenges, Automated, Foreign Exchange, Forex...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{instruments}} for environmental policies could reach {{their full potential}} of efficiency in economies in which all commodities are exchanged on competitive markets and agents are maximising operators, ready for <b>catching</b> any market <b>opportunity</b> and sensitive to price signals. This ideal cannot be held as a realistic picture neither of OECD countries nor economies in transition to market, even if market mechanisms have gained, to a different degree, a considerable influence on their economic life. As far as environmental issues are concerned, contexts of action are of mixed-economies type, with an important role given to public regulation and public or collective financial circuits for environmental programmes. Happily, well designed economic instruments can do quite well for improving the cost-effectiveness of such policy contexts without waiting a full development of a market economy. This gains may be derived directly (positive incentives to minimise abatement costs), or by opportunity (alleviating technological and administrative rigidities). They can also result from reforms and new institutional settings they make possible ('green tax reform', or setting up water communities) {{on top of their}} direct incentive dimension.

Comparative studies of SC versus IV, IM versus IV, or IM versus SC have been sporadically conducted, and some new findings are completely different from the dosage recommendation as described in prescribing information. However, clinicians may still be ignorant of such new evidence-based findings when choosing treatment methods. Methods: A literature search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Sciences™ Core Collection to analyze {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of SC, IV, and IM administration in head-to-head comparative studies. Results: “SC better than IV” involves trastuzumab, rituximab, antitumor necrosis factor medications, bortezomib, amifostine, recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, recombinant interleukin- 2, immunoglobulin, epoetin alfa, heparin, and opioids. “IV better than SC” involves ketamine, vitamin K 1, and abatacept. With respect to insulin and ketamine, whether IV has advantages over SC is determined by specific clinical circumstances. “IM better than IV” involves epinephrine, hepatitis B immunoglobulin, pegaspargase, and some antibiotics. “IV better than IM” involves ketamine, morphine, and antivenom. “IM better than SC” involves epinephrine. “SC better than IM” involves interferon-beta- 1 a, methotrexate, human chorionic gonadotropin, hepatitis B immunoglobulin, hydrocortisone, and morphine. Safety, efficacy, patient preference, and pharmacoeconomics are four principles governing the choice of injection route. Safety and efficacy must be the preferred principles to be considered (eg, epinephrine should be given intramuscularly during an episode of systemic anaphylaxis). If the safety and efficacy of two injection routes are equivalent, clinicians should consider more about patient preference and pharmacoeconomics because patient preference will ensure optimal treatment adherence and ultimately improve patient experience or satisfaction, while pharmacoeconomic concern will help alleviate nurse shortages and reduce overall health care costs. Besides the principles, the following detailed factors might affect the decision: patient characteristics-related factors (body mass index, age, sex, medical status [eg, renal impairment, comorbidities], personal attitudes toward safety and convenience, past experience, perception of current disease status, health literacy, and socioeconomic status), medication administration-related factors (anatomical site of injection, dose, frequency, formulation characteristics, administration time, indication, flexibility in the route of administration), and health care staff/institution-related factors (knowledge, human resources). Conclusion: This updated review of findings of comparative studies of different injection routes will enrich the knowledge of safe, efficacious, economic, and patient preference-oriented medication administration as well as <b>catching</b> research <b>opportunities</b> in clinical nursing practice.

40|$|The use {{of direct}} {{distribution}} of agricultural products is, {{in most of}} the cases in France, initiated by producers. The few experiments led by groups of consummers were limited, until now, to organic products. The recent expansion of consummers networks (AMAP) based on the japanese experience of Teikei (Ikegami, 2005) brings out new explanations to the growing success of direct distribution. However, the farmer's motivation remains the starting point for these initiatives in Brittany. The focus {{of this paper is to}} describe these motivations considering the expectations of a growing part of the population. The analysis conducted by Matthieu Anasaloni (chapter 8) on the motivations propounded by consummers met in Guichen annual organic agriculture exhibition shows three main categories: country-style nostalgia, contemporary hedonism and (micro-) political involvements. The objective of this paper is to understand how producers try to answer these expectations through direct distribution. Thus, the producer's motivations can be understood as direct answers to these needs : 1. coming back to traditional agriculture, 2. <b>catching</b> market <b>opportunities</b> and 3. a political reaction to intensive production processes. Based on the answers of 38 producers in Brittany who use direct distribution, this paper proposes to confront these assumptions to the reality of the process that leads a growing number of farmers to choose this short and alternative relation with the public. We can first set aside the first assumption. Some traditional values of agriculture are not necessary incompatible with a modern production process: promoting quality can be achieved considering recent norms and the relationships can be convivial even over the neighbourhood. If nostalgia does exist in the mind of a category of consummers, we do not consider that producers who learnt their activity in a context of a centralized agriculture take that nostalgia into account in their approach. The second class of motivation seems to be more relevant in the light of the answers given for our survey. The search for added value is the main reason for farmers to adopt direct distribution. But this assertion must take the size of farms into account: small farms can use direct distribution to balance the lack of economies of scale and large ones use short tracks in response to cyclical or sectorial shocks. However the producer's wish to extract his activity from the standard production with that kind of differenciation does not seem so obvious. We can enlarge the possible opportunities given by direct distribution by considering the adaptation of the activity to the familial structure and the search for contact as the will to give value to a special skill. Once more, these opportunities can not explain by themselves the pace of the producers. Most of the producers live in couple, but the fact to be in couple is not significantly determinant in the choice. A skill given by an past experience requiring contact with a public can be a source of motivation, but we observe that this category of producer is not more likely to invest itself in selling tasks. The farmers's wish to be in contact with the consummers and with the public finds its source in a need for recognition of agriculture as a whole and not only for differenciation on the part of one single farm. Most of these opportunities are taken into account by producers in accordance with each attribute. But {{in most of the}} cases, the economics and rational explanations show their limits. Thus, it seems also necessary to consider direct distribution as a critical reaction to the socio- economic context and as an evolution of agricultural practices. A global view of the deep motivations of the producers we met shows a divide between trying to improve the image of agriculture and searching for an alternative of the productivist agriculture. If the first class tend toward a perspective of sustained development – an attitude that can take a concrete form in the landscape practices or in the contractaul engagements (CTE, CAD) - the other one comprehend direct distribution as a break with the existing model. But all of the producers consider direct distribution as a gain of autonomy. This autonomy has a important cost in time, work and avalaibility. This important cost confirms the need for farmers to believe more in their own convictions than in an invividual rationality. La vente directe de produits agricoles est en France, dans la plupart des cas, l'initiative de producteurs. Le développement récent des AMAP montre que cela peut évoluer. Dans ce contexte il est important de comprendre les motivations des agriculteurs engagés dans la vente directe, d'autant plus que cette motivation individuelle est à l'origine de la plupart des initiatives en Bretagne. L'analyse des motivations des consommateurs peut s'organiser autour de la nostalgie rurale, de l'hédonisme contemporain et de micro-engagements politiques. Nous proposons en parallèle d'examiner en quoi les vendeurs directs cherchent à revenir à une certaine tradition paysanne, cherchent à profiter d'opportunités de marché ou bien construisent une réaction de nature politique au paradigme productiviste. Une enquête auprès de 38 vendeurs directs de Haute-Bretagne permet d'éliminer la première hypothèse : pas l'ombre d'une nostalgie dans les réponses. Par contre la recherche de valeur ajoutée semble la raison principale et largement partagée. Pour les petites fermes c'est un complément d'activité, pour les plus grosses c'est une diversification pour contrer les risques de marché. Autre opportunité, la vente directe valorise le travail familial, et particulièrement le travail des femmes. Néanmoins, si presque tous les vendeurs directs travaillent en couple, cela n'est pas le facteur décisif du choix. L'expérience passée d'un contact avec le public semble plus déterminante. Les motivations économiques ne suffisent pas à décrire les choix. Une analyse approfondie des motivations des agriculteurs rencontrés les divise entre ceux qui cherchent à améliorer l'image de l'agriculture (aux yeux du public mais aussi à leurs propres yeux) et ceux qui cherchent à construire une alternative au productivisme. L'ensemble cherche une meilleure autonomie, les premiers au sein du marché, les second en tentant de sortir des cadres de référence établis. Cette autonomie coûte cher en investissement et surtout en temps de travail, coût que tous assument, préférant suivre la logique de leurs convictions qu'une prétendue rationalité individuelle...|$|R
