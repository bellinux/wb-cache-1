Concealed by storm and darkness, the combined Athenian force reached the vicinity without being spotted by the Peloponnesians. Here the Athenians devised a plot to draw the enemy into battle. According to Diodorus Siculus, Alcibiades advanced with a small squadron in order to draw the Spartans out to battle, and, after he successfully deceived Mindarus with this ploy, the squadrons of Thrasybulus and Theramenes came to join him, cutting off the Spartans' retreat.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} early Greek historiography and later Roman historiography, Felix Jacoby {{identified}} thirteen possible ancient historians {{who wrote about}} Macedonia in his Fragmente der griechischen Historiker. Aside from accounts in Herodotus and Thucydides, the works compiled by Jacoby are only fragmentary, whereas other works are completely lost, such as the history of an Illyrian war fought by Perdiccas III written by Antipater. The Macedonian historians Marsyas of Pella and Marsyas of Philippi wrote histories of Macedonia, the Ptolemaic king Ptolemy I Soter authored a history about Alexander, and Hieronymus of <b>Cardia</b> wrote a history about Alexander's royal successors. Following the Indian campaign of Alexander the Great, the Macedonian military officer Nearchus wrote a work of his voyage {{from the mouth of}} the Indus river to the Persian Gulf. The Macedonian historian Craterus published a compilation of decrees made by the popular assembly of the Athenian democracy, ostensibly while attending the school of Aristotle. Philip V of Macedon had manuscripts of the history of PhilipII written by Theopompus gathered by his court scholars and disseminated with further copies.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Mycale, the Allied fleet {{sailed to}} the Hellespont {{to break down}} the pontoon bridges, but found that this had already been done. The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians {{remained}} to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians and their allies made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region. Amongst them was one Oeobazus of <b>Cardia,</b> who had with him the cables and other equipment from the pontoon bridges. The Persian governor, Artayctes had not prepared for a siege, not believing that the Allies would attack. The Athenians therefore were able to lay a siege around Sestos. The siege dragged on for several months, causing some discontent amongst the Athenian troops, but eventually, when the food ran out in the City, the Persians fled at night from the least guarded area of the city. The Athenians were thus able to take possession of the city the next day.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} of a new surgical technique for the resection of the distal third of the esophagus and/or <b>cardias</b> for neoplasm. MethodsThis surgical technique consists of two steps: 1 Insertion of the anvil of a common Entero-Enteric-Anastomotic Surgical Circular Stapler (EEATM) without hand-sewn securing. For this purpose we built a stainless steel support bar for the anvil that is thinner than the freespace of a standard linear suturing stapler (TATM). The support bar holds up a push rod that {{can be adapted to}} the hooking–unhooking of the anvil. 2 Anchoring the anvil to the proximal esophageal stump by suturing directly the esophagus with the TATM over the support bar, mobile and thus unhooked from the anvil, in order to perform the esophago-enteric anastomosis with the classic circular stapler EEATM (double-stapling). ResultsWe performed our new technique on five cadavers. We did not encounter any difficulty during the procedures. We tested the anastomosis with hydropneumatic assessment without recording any leaks. The esophago–enteric anastomosis was then opened without finding any mechanical defects related to the procedure. ConclusionIt can often be very difficult to fashion a safe hand-sewn pouch or a purse string around the anvil of an EEATM during the resection of the distal third of the esophagus or the <b>cardias</b> by a trans-hiatal approach. Moreover, there is no standardized procedure to minimize anastomotic leak. To avoid these mechanical problems we designed this innovative procedure, which is considered to be reproducible without significant training...|$|R

However, Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy, concerned about Perdiccas' increasing signs of self-aggrandizement, formed a coalition against him in open civil war that began with Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. When Perdiccas invaded Egypt {{in the summer of}} 321 BC to assault Ptolemy, he marched along the Nile River where 2,000 of his men drowned, leading the officers under his command to conspire against him and assassinate him. Although Eumenes of <b>Cardia</b> managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had no grand effect on the course of events now that the victorious coalition convened in Syria to settle the issue of a new regency and territorial rights in the 321 BC Partition of Triparadisus. The council appointed Antipater as regent over the two kings, after which Antipater delegated authority to the leading generals.

5|$|From 343 BC onwards, {{in order}} to try and disrupt the peace, Demosthenes and his {{followers}} used every expedition and action of Philip to argue that he was breaking the peace. Finally, in 341 BC, matters began to come to a head. Athens sent out new settlers to the cleruchs on the Chersonsese under the command of Diopeithes, who proceeded to ravage the territory of <b>Cardia,</b> an ally of Philip. Philip therefore wrote to the Athenians to demand that they desist, but in his speech 'On the Chersonese', Demosthenes persuaded the Athenians that since Athens was effectively at war with Philip anyway, {{there was no need to}} do what Philip asked; Diopeithes therefore continued to cause trouble in Thrace. Then, in the Third Philippic of approximately May 341 BC, Demosthenes accused Philip of breaking the peace by intervening in the affairs of Euboea. Finally, in the Fourth Philippic delivered later in 341 BC, Demosthenes argued that Athens should send an embassy to the Persian king, requesting money for a forthcoming war with Macedon. The embassy was sent, much to Philip's anger, but was sharply rebuffed by the Persians.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} part of 352 BC several key events had {{occurred}} in, or around Thrace which challenged Philip's influence in the region. The Athenian general Chares captured Sestos, on the Thracian Chersonese early in the year, probably taking the city from Kersebleptes. The Athenians had a long-standing interest in the Chersonese for strategic reasons, and it had formed a significant part of their 'Empire' in the 5th century BC. Firstly, Athens depended largely on the import of grain from the Crimea for her food supply; controlling the Chersonese helped to ensure that supplies could safely pass through the Hellespont. Secondly, the Chersonese was used as a place to settle the excess citizenry of Athens, usually in the form of cleruchies, colonies which were not politically independent of the mother city. After the capture of Sestos, Kersebleptes, who up until now had resisted Athenian attempts to reclaim the Chersonese, now came to terms with Athens. He was probably now worried about Philip's influence in the region, and thus sought to ally with the Athenians, giving them control of all the cities of the Chersonese except <b>Cardia.</b> Furthermore, the Chalkidian League also seems to have turned against Philip in 352 BC, presumably also concerned by his designs on their territory, and sought peace with Athens.|$|E

Histochemical methods included periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Alcian blue (AB) at pH 2. 5 and 1. 0 and high-iron-diamine AB pH 2. 5. Binding of lectins Con A, DBA, WGA, LTA, LFA, PNA and SBA; LFA, PNA and SBA with prior sialidase treatment; and paradoxical Con A were evaluated. The oesophagus lacked glands. The stomach {{was divided into}} a short <b>cardias,</b> a wide fundus and a brief pylorus. The surface muciparous cells secreted sulpho- and sialomucins with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues, N-acetyllactosamine and (b 1, 4 N-acetylglucosamine) n chains. Towards the pylorus, N-acetylgalactosamine residues disappeared and acidity decreased. Cardiac glands, neck cells in the fundic glands, pyloric and duodenal Brunner’s glands all shared neutral, stable class-III mucins, mainly with N-acetylgalactosamine sequences. The intestine was divided into a duodenum, a jejuno-ileum and a short rectum. The goblet cells produced sulpho- and sialomucins with sialylated N-acetylgalactosamine sequences, (b 1, 4 N-acetylglucosamine) n and N-acetyllactosamine, whose sialylation increased towards the rectum.

40|$|OBJECTIVE:The study {{reviews the}} {{endoscopic}} and histological features of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections {{of the upper}} gastrointestinal (UGI) tract. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Clinical histories, endoscopic findings and bioptic specimens of 30 cases of HCMV infection of the UGI tract, diagnosed in a University Hospital in a 10 -year period, were reviewed. In all cases, viral inclusion bodies were detected in routine histopathological sections and the diagnosis was confirmed with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS:Six patients were HIV+, whereas four had received organ transplantations, one was affected by common variable immunodeficiency and four had a recent history of malignancy. No other pathologic condition was evidenced in the remaining 15 cases. Mucosal alterations were endoscopically observed in the stomach (19 cases), esophagus (9), <b>cardias</b> (6) and duodenum (1), and multiple organs being synchronously affected in five patients (3 HIV+, 2 with history of malignancy). The antropyloric area was the most frequently affected site. Single ulcers were detected in 11 cases and multiple ulcers in 8, whereas mucosal thickenings (in the form of localized thickenings, polyps or rugal hypertrophy) were present in 13 patients. Thickenings of the mucosa were detected only in the stomach. At histology, necrotic material and granulation tissue were associated with moderate or marked lympho-plasmacytic infiltrate and foveolar hyperplasia in ulcerative lesions, whereas lesions labeled as mucosal thickenings showed mild or moderate chronic inflammatory infiltrate and foveolar hyperplasia.

40|$|Background: Gender {{differences}} {{have been reported}} in patients with the congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS). We analyzed whether electrocardiographic differences existed in females, males, girls and boys in response to beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Methods: 12 -lead ECGs before and during beta-adrenoceptor blockade were collected in 87 genotyped LQTS patients (48 women, 14 men, 12 girls and 13 boys). Up to three QTc intervals were determined in each lead of the ECG. V 4 was used for QT/QTc analysis. Difference between longest and shortest QT interval was taken as a measure for dispersion of QT intervals. Results: (1) Adult males had the greatest shortening of the QTc interval upon treatment with P-adrenoceptor blockade. During treatment, adult males with LQTS(1) (mutation in the KCNQ 1 gene, affecting I-Ks current) were found to have shorter QTc intervals than adult females; this difference did not exist in LQTS(2) patients (mutation in the HERG gene, affecting I-Kr current). (2) Female LQTS(2) patients had a 50 % larger dispersion than female LQTS(1) patients both before and during treatment. (3) Adult male LQTS(1) patients, constitute the only patient group with a marked decrease in QTc intervals and dispersion associated with a 100 % efficacy of treatment in response to beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Conclusions: These findings indicate that, in addition to underlying differences in repolarization between men and women, <b>cardiae</b> electrophysiological responses to beta-adrenoceptor blockade can be modulated by gender-related factors.

Histopathologic analyses, selected electron microscopy, and urease mapping were performed on mucosal samples collected from the <b>cardias</b> and fundi, bodies, and antra of these cats' stomachs. H. pylori organisms were abundant in all areas of the stomach on the basis of histologic evaluation and urease mapping. H. pylori infection was associated with a moderate to severe lymphofollicular gastritis in 21 of 24 cats (88 %). The gastritis was most pronounced in the antral region and consisted mainly of multifocal lymphoplasmacytic follicular infiltrates in the deep mucosa. The severity of gastritis in the antrum corresponded to high numbers of H. pylori there {{on the basis of the}} use of the urease assay as an indicator of H. pylori colonization. Ten of 24 cats (42 %) also had small to moderate numbers of eosinophils in the gastric mucosa. All 24 cats had gastric lymphoid follicles, with follicles being most prevalent in the antrum.

25|$|A {{description}} of sati {{appears in the}} Greek 1st-century BC historian Diodorus Siculus's account of the war fought in Iran between two of Alexander the Great's generals, Eumenes of <b>Cardia</b> and Antigonus Monophthalmus. In 317 BC Eumenes' cosmopolitan army defeated that of Antigonus in the Battle of Paraitakene. Among the fallen was one Ceteus, the commander of Eumenes' Indian soldiers. Diodorus writes that Ceteus had been followed on campaign by his two wives, at his funeral the two wives competed for the honour of joining their husband on the pyre. After the older wife {{was found to be}} pregnant, Eumenes' generals ruled in favour of the younger. She was led to the pyre crowned in garlands to the hymns of her kinsfolk. The whole army then marched three times around the pyre before it was lit. According to Diodorus the practice of sati started because Indians married for love, unlike the Greeks who favoured marriages arranged by the parents. When inevitably many of these love marriages turned sour, the woman would often poison the husband and find a new lover. To end these murders, a law was therefore instituted that the widow should either join her husband in death or live in perpetual widowhood. Modern historians believe Diodorus' source for this episode was the eyewitness account of the now lost historian Hieronymus of <b>Cardia.</b> Hieronymus' explanation of the origin of sati appears to be his own composite, created from a variety of Indian traditions and practices to form a moral lesson upholding traditional Greek values.|$|E

40|$|We {{show for}} a simple noncollinear {{configuration}} of the atomistic spins (in particular, where one spin is rotated by a finite angle in a ferromagnetic background) that the pairwise energy variation computed in terms of multiple-scattering formalism cannot be fully mapped onto a bilinear Heisenberg spin model {{even in the absence}} of spin-orbit coupling. The non-Heisenberg terms induced by the spin-polarized host appear in leading orders in the expansion of the infinitesimal angle variations. However, an E g − T 2 g symmetry analysis based on the orbital decomposition of the exchange parameters in bcc Fe leads to the conclusion that the nearest-neighbor exchange parameters related to the T 2 g orbitals are essentially Heisenberg-like: they do not depend on the spin configuration, and can, in this case, be mapped onto a Heisenberg spin model even in extreme noncollinear cases.

Conclusion: Participants with VF /VT as primary registered <b>cardias</b> arrest rhythm had significant better cognitive and physical function 6 months after hypothermia-treated cardiac arrest compared with participants with asystole/PEA as primary registered rhythm. This shows the importance of access to defibrillators in public places in the society and in hospitals and optimal education of lay people and medical staff. Cognitive and physical function and self-rated health improves over time, which might be a very important reason to convey patients, relatives and medical staff to continue cognitive and physical rehabilitation.   Keywords: Cardiac arrest, hypothermia, cognitive and physical function, wellbeein...|$|R
40|$|In most {{developed}} countries {{the proportion of}} elderly people in the population {{is expected to increase}} in the next decades. Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death and disability in the elderly and it is predicted that the absolute incidence rates of cardiac disease in older adults will increase significantly in the years to come. Since the invention of electrocardiography in 1902 by Willem Einthoven, the electrocardiogram (ECG) has gained an important position in clinical cardiology. In the last decade, computer programs for ECG interpretation with good pelformance have become available, improving the applicability of ECGs in medical practice and in epidemiologic research. The EeG offers an inexpensive. noninvasive instrument to determine the presence of coronmy hemt disease as well as other <b>cardiae</b> abnormalities, such as ventricular hypertrophy and atrial fibrillation, known {{to be associated with the}} risk of future cardiovascular events. Especially in the elderly, in whom medical histories may be troubled by concomitant diseases and are not always as reliable as one would desire, the ECG could serve as a useful diagnostic and prognostic instrument. Since the 1950 s, large epidemiologic studies among young and middle-aged men and women have provided important information on the prevalence and prognosis of ECG abnormalities. Relatively few studies have been pelfonned in the elderly. A comparison of individual studies is hampered because of differences in diagnostic criteria applied in the individual studies, although comparability has improved since the introduction in 1960 of the Minnesota Code as a standardized coding system for the ECG. Recently, several studies reported that ECG indicators of autonomic balance, such as heart rate variability and QTc interval duration, may be strong predictors of cardiac and all-cause mortality, both in middle-aged and in older subjects...|$|R
