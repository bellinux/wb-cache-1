The company then moved into art books, biographies and eventually graphic novels, including Neal Adams' Monsters (2003), (originally serialized in the comics anthology series Echoes of Future Past, published by Adams' <b>Continuity</b> <b>Studios),</b> with four additional story pages plus additional Adams material.
