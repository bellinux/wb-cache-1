Matched field methods as, e. g., the well known conventional “matched field processing” (MFP) or the “model based matched filter” (MBMF), are able to estimate the best fit from the correlation of modelled acoustic pressure fields with the field measured {{in an array of}} hydrophones in the first case, or with the impulsive response in timedomain in the second case. The results of the whole process show estimations of physical parameters that could represent the seabed (attenuations, densities, sound speeds), the water column (sound speed profile, depth) or the geometries (receiver depth, source depth, sourcereceiver range). The technique can be tuned and applied to geoacoustic inversion, acoustic tomography or passive source localization.

The compartmentalized character of this genome, its small size, and the ease of its isolation have made it, since its discovery, an attractive object for studies of gene organization and expression in a simple eukaryotic system. As a result, about 10 years ago, mtDNA was the best <b>characterized</b> <b>portion</b> of the hu-man genome. Its physical structure was well under-stood, the unique features of its transcription were known, the two rRNAs and most of the tRNAs en-coded in mtDNA had been identified and mapped, and the first hints of the extraordinarily compact organi-zation of this genome had been discovered (Attardi et al. 1976); furthermore, vidence was lready available about he number of mRNAs and proteins encoded in this genome, and the probable function of some of these proteins (Costantino and Attardi 1975).

40|$|Conversion to a mucoid, {{exopolysaccharide}} alginate-overproducing phenotype in Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{is associated}} with chronic respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis. Mucoidy is caused by muc mutations that derepress the alternative sigma factor AlgU, which in turn activates alginate biosynthetic and ancillary regulatory genes. Here we report the molecular characterization of two newly identified genes, algW and mucD, that affect expression of mucoidy. The algW gene, mapping at 69 min, was isolated {{on the basis of}} its ability to suppress mucoidy and reduce transcription of the alginate biosynthetic gene algD. The predicted primary structure of AlgW displayed similarity to HtrA (DegP), a serine protease involved in proteolysis of abnormal proteins and required for resistance to oxidative and heat stress in enteric bacteria. Inactivation of algW on the chromosome of the wild-type nonmucoid strain PAO 1 caused increased sensitivity to heat, H 2 O 2, and paraquat, a redox cycling compound inducing intracellular levels of superoxide. This mutation also permitted significant induction of alginate production in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of paraquat. Two new genes, mucC and mucD, were identified immediately downstream of the previously <b>characterized</b> <b>portion</b> (algU mucA mucB) of the gene cluster at 67. 5 min encoding the alternative sigma factor AlgU and its regulators. Interestingly, the predicted gene product of mucD also showed similarities to HtrA. Inactivation of mucD on the PAO 1 chromosome resulted in conversion to the mucoid phenotype. The mutation in mucD also caused increased sensitivity to H 2 O 2 and heat killing. However, in contrast to algW mutants, no increase in susceptibility to paraquat was observed in mucD mutants. These findings indicate that algW and mucD play partially overlapping but distinct roles in P. aeruginosa resistance to reactive oxygen intermediates and heat. In addition, since mutations in mucD and algW cause conversion to mucoidy or lower the threshold for its induction by reactive oxygen intermediates, these factors may repress alginate synthesis either directly by acting on AlgU or its regulators or indirectly by removing physiological signals that may activate this stress response system...|$|R

In this study, I assume that the network evolves by gene duplication and divergence. Initially, the duplicated gene will retain its old interactions. As the gene accumulates mutations, it gains new interactions and may or may not lose the old interactions. I investigate evidence for the duplication-divergence model by looking at the homology and regulatory networks in E. coli and propose a simple duplication-divergence model for growth.
