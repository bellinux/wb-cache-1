5|$|At {{the start}} of the awards in 1975, seven {{categories}} were presented: Best Novel, Best Short Fiction, Best Collection, Best Artist, Special Award—Professional, Special Award—Non-professional, and Life Achievement. Only a few categories have changed since then, and no <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to the rules. 1978 saw the addition of the Convention Award, a special award given for general contributions to the genre, and the only award not given every year since the beginning. The Short Fiction award was split into Short Story and Novella awards in 1982, and in 1988 the multi-author anthologies, previously eligible for the Collection award, were split into their own Best Anthology category. No <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made since.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy {{has been}} remade several times for {{different}} platforms and has frequently been packaged with Final Fantasy II in various collections.

5|$|Following Moores' {{exit from}} Everton's hierarchy, minimum <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to Goodison Park's {{structure}} due to costs, two British Government Acts; the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and Football Spectators Act 1989 {{have forced the}} club's hand into improving the facilities. Upon Moore's death the club was sold to Peter Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Following lengthy {{discussions between}} Royal Mail {{managers}} and union representatives {{a deal to}} settle the dispute was finally agreed to on 8 March 2010. This would see Royal Mail workers receiving a 6.9% pay rise over three years (worth 2% in 2010, 1.4% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012), while extra payments worth up to £1,400 would be made to full-time workers once all the agreed <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made. These will {{take the form of a}} £400 payment following the agreement of union members and a further £1,000 to be paid once the planned <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> implemented. In addition the Royal Mail agreed to keep 75% of the workforce as full-time, rather than part-time staff, and to reduce working hours from 40 to 39 hours a week. In exchange, the CWU agreed to Royal Mail's modernisation strategy which include plans to introduce the automated walk sequencing machinery.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, a {{paved road}} was built from MS 2 to the Alcorn–Tishomingo county line. It was later {{extended}} to MS 25 in 1981, and was designated as MS 350 {{in the same}} year. No significant <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to the route since.|$|E

5|$|Mississippi Highway 350 (MS 350) is {{a highway}} in extreme {{northern}} Mississippi. Its western terminus is at MS 2 near Corinth. The road travels near the Tennessee state line to its eastern terminus at MS 25. The route was designated in 1981, and no significant <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made since.|$|E
5|$|Since 1934, some {{important}} <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{observed in the}} lake's biota, including {{a reduction in the}} number of Chara species, and an increase in the area covered by Salvinia since 1937. Analysis of the lake has also revealed the tendency for it to develop monospecific communities of submerged macrophytes such as Ceratophyllum and Myriophyllum.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the building is also similar to how it appeared when the house was constructed. However, a few <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made. In 1910 the two marble fireplaces were replaced by brick. The flooring has been replaced as needed. The home's basement, once the main living area, has since been converted several times for other uses.|$|E

5|$|K-3 first {{appears on}} the 1932 state highway map. At that time, the route was almost {{completely}} gravel; only the concurrency with US-54 was paved. By 1950, the portion of K-3 in Crawford County had been paved. The portion of the route from the CrawfordBourbon county line to {{the west end of}} the concurrency with K-39 was paved in 1953, and the remainder of the road was paved by 1958. No significant <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to the route since then.|$|E
5|$|Reintroduction of sea otters to British Columbia {{has led to}} a {{dramatic}} improvement in the health of coastal ecosystems, and similar <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> observed as sea otter populations recovered in the Aleutian and Commander Islands and the Big Sur coast of California However, some kelp forest ecosystems in California have also thrived without sea otters, with sea urchin populations apparently controlled by other factors. The role of sea otters in maintaining kelp forests has been observed to be more important in areas of open coast than in more protected bays and estuaries.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Crescent is {{a row of}} 30 terraced houses {{laid out}} in a {{sweeping}} crescent in the city of Bath, England. Designed by the architect John Wood, the Younger and built between 1767 and 1774, it is among the greatest examples of Georgian architecture {{to be found in the}} United Kingdom and is a Grade I listed building. Although some <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to the various interiors over the years, the Georgian stone façade remains much as it was when it was first built.|$|E

30|$|The {{majority}} of pastoralists and agropastoralists questioned in the testing phase believed they perceived {{climate change and}} {{that the level of}} awareness was explained in terms of its impact on local agriculture. A question was therefore added and survey instrument modified to elicit the level of climate change perception through its impact on agriculture using a five-point Likert scale; 1) no perception and thus no perception of impact on agriculture; 2) climate <b>change</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> noticeable but <b>has</b> not significantly impacted agriculture; 3) climate <b>change</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> noticeable and <b>has</b> impacted agriculture to a certain extent; 4) climate <b>change</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> noticeable with a substantial impact on agriculture and 5) climate <b>change</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> noticeable and <b>has</b> completely <b>changed</b> the way farming is done. Climate data (monthly rainfall, number of rainy days and monthly temperature), from five meteorological stations covering the study area, were obtained from National Meteorology Agency of Ethiopia. The data were then pooled and mean values were computed to evaluate long-term trends in terms of climate variables.|$|R
50|$|Jones and Clements {{proposed}} moving all but {{one species}} of Genoplesium to Corunastylis however the <b>change</b> <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> accepted by most authorities, including Index Kewensis and the National Herbarium of New South Wales. The <b>change</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> accepted by Royal Botanic Gardens, Victoria who list 11 species of Corunastylis.|$|R
5|$|The first {{change to}} the highway's {{alignment}} occurred on November 1, 1966, when SH-51 was straightened between Stillwater and Yale; SH-108 was realigned to continue to concur with SH-51. Around the same time, the remainder of SH-108 was paved. The final change to SH-108 was made on June 4, 1974, when a straightening of SH-33 resulted in a slight extension of SH-108 to continue to meet the new highway. No <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made since.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was formed}} by July 1, 1919 along two {{discontinuous}} sections of its current corridor. The gap was filled in by 1927, but a second break in the routing {{was created in the}} 1930s. This second interruption in the corridor was eliminated within a year. The various paths that M-46 has followed have been straightened over the intervening years, producing the modern corridor by the 1970s. Other <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to the location of the western terminus in Muskegon, but it has remained fixed in its current location since 1984.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Route 5 was {{designated}} in 1926 along the Route 2 alignment. Between 1926 and 1932, U.S. Route 5 and Route 2 were co-signed throughout {{the length of}} the route. In the 1932 state highway renumbering, the Route 2 designation was removed, leaving only the US 5 designation. Only a small number of <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made since then, the most prominent being in the cities of New Haven and Hartford.|$|E

5|$|As of 2017, {{just under}} 20,000 protein-coding genes {{are seen to}} be {{expressed}} in the human, and some 400 of these genes are brain-specific. The data that has been provided on gene expression in the brain has fuelled further research {{into a number of}} disorders. The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder. These <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence, and also to other substance abuses.|$|E
5|$|In {{writing the}} stage adaptation, Sullivan made several {{changes to the}} story; these {{included}} creating a fiancée for Jekyll and a stronger moral contrast between Jekyll and Hyde. The <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> adopted by many subsequent adaptations, including several film versions of the story which were derived from the play. The films included a 1912 adaptation directed by Lucius Henderson, a 1920 adaptation directed by John S. Robertson, and a 1931 adaptation directed by Rouben Mamoulian, which earned Fredric March an Academy Award for Best Actor. A 1941 adaptation, directed by Victor Fleming, was a remake of the 1931 film.|$|E
5|$|M-33 was {{designated}} by 1919 along {{a section of}} the current highway between Mio and Atlanta. The highway also included roadway segments south of Mio that are now parts of other trunklines. The portion south of Mio was rerouted in the mid-1920s, transferring sections to M-72 in the process. The state started extending M-33 in both directions in 1930s. The current highway segment between Onaway and Cheboygan was the former route of US Highway 23 (US23) until 1940 when the latter highway was realigned onto an alignment that runs along Lake Huron. Several minor <b>changes</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to M-33's routing since the 1950s to straighten out curves or finish paving the highway.|$|E
