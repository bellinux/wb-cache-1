5|$|Charles {{suffered}} a sudden apoplectic {{fit on the}} morning of 2 February 1685, and died aged 54 at 11:45am four days later at Whitehall Palace. The suddenness of his illness and death led to suspicion of poison in the minds of many, including one of the royal doctors; however, a more modern medical analysis has held that the symptoms of his final illness {{are similar to those of}} uraemia (a clinical syndrome due to kidney dysfunction). In the days between his collapse and his death, Charles endured a variety of torturous treatments including bloodletting, purging and <b>cupping</b> in hopes of effecting a recovery.|$|E
5|$|Al-Tabari {{states that}} al-Mu'tasim fell ill on 21 October 841. His regular doctor, Salmawayh ibn Bunan, whom the Caliph had trusted implicitly, had died the {{previous}} year and the new physician Yahya ibn Masawayh did not follow the normal treatment of <b>cupping</b> and purging, which according to Hunayn ibn Ishaq worsened the caliph's illness and brought about his death on 5 January 842, after a reign of eight years, eight months and two days according to the Islamic calendar. He {{was buried in the}} Jawsaq al-Khaqani palace in Samarra. The succession of his son, al-Wathiq, was unopposed. Al-Wathiq's reign, through unremarkable, was essentially a continuation of al-Mu'tasim's own, as the government continued to be led by the men al-Mu'tasim had raised to power: the Turks Itakh, Wasif, and Ashinas, the vizier Ibn al-Zayyat, and the chief qādī Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad.|$|E
5|$|Complementary therapies {{have been}} {{investigated}} for treating people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce {{the total number of}} skin lesions in those with acne. Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, but has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis. Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes, and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed); however, few studies have been performed, and most have been of lower methodological quality. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or <b>cupping</b> therapy for acne.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, {{the team}} was not {{announced}} at the scheduled time due to the delay caused by the veto. Journalists deduced the story and Barnes became a cause célèbre for many weeks, missing all the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as {{to the nature of}} his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship regarding Barnes's behaviour was deposited in the NSWCA library. It accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by <b>cupping</b> his hands over his eyes and showing dissent by implying that they were blind.|$|E
5|$|Ivy's {{alternate}} character {{designs in}} the games are a contrast to her primary designs, with the secondary from Soulcalibur to Soulcalibur III consisting of countess attire of either blue or red pants, vest, and jacket, with white boots covering her feet and her hair combed back. In Soulcalibur II, a tertiary alternate design was added consisting of a red leotard and gloves with gold trimming, with red stockings on her legs; in addition, a fourth design resembling her appearance {{at the conclusion of}} Soulcalibur was considered, incorporating a cloak and the symbol of caduceus on the front of her leotard <b>cupping</b> her breasts, but was unused. In Soulcalibur III, a long, rose-themed dress with hat and veil was used as a tertiary alternate, one of several considered designs. For Soulcalibur IV, a similarly themed black dress was used as her sole alternate design for the game.|$|E

25|$|Folk medicine, {{including}} ancient medicine of Egyptians, Greeks, Celts, Turks, Slavs, Mayans, Aztecs and Chinese, {{has used}} bruising {{as a treatment}} for some health problems. The methods vary widely and include <b>cupping,</b> scraping, and slapping. Fire <b>cupping</b> uses suction which causes bruising in patients. Scraping (Gua Sha) uses a small hand device with a rounded edge to gently scrape the scalp or the skin. Another ancient device that creates mild bruising is a strigil, used by Greeks and Romans in the bath. Archaeologically there is no precedent for scraping tools before Greek archaeological evidence, not Chinese or Egyptian.|$|E

25|$|The {{school of}} {{medicine}} for women followed a French model. The {{first two years of}} training provided Arabic literacy in order to communicate with patients. The following four included training in: obstetrics, pre- and post-natal care, dressing wounds, cauterization, vaccination, scarification, <b>cupping,</b> application of leeches, identification / preparation of common medicines.

McDowell, where he learned contemporary techniques of fire <b>cupping</b> and leeching, then considered the primary techniques to treat disease. He continued to study medicine under the mentorship of Dr. McDowell and other abolitionist doctors, such as Dr. F. Julius LeMoyne and Dr. Joseph P. Gazzam of Pittsburgh.|$|E
25|$|The Ganges is {{a sacred}} river to Hindus along every {{fragment}} of its length. All along its course, Hindus bathe in its waters, paying homage to their ancestors and to their gods by <b>cupping</b> the water in their hands, lifting it and letting it fall back into the river; they offer flowers and rose petals and float shallow clay dishes filled with oil and lit with wicks (diyas). On the journey back home from the Ganges, they carry small quantities of river water with them for use in rituals (Ganga jal, literally water of the Ganges).|$|E

50|$|By 1968, all UEFA {{member nations}} {{had set up}} {{domestic}} <b>cup</b> competitions due {{to the success of}} the <b>Cup</b> Winners' <b>Cup.</b> UEFA regarded it as the second most prestigious competition, behind the European <b>Cup</b> (later the UEFA Champions League) and ahead of the Fairs <b>Cup</b> (later the UEFA <b>Cup).</b> Therefore, a team qualified for both the European <b>Cup</b> and the <b>Cup</b> Winners' <b>Cup</b> would play in the European <b>Cup,</b> whereas a team qualified for both the UEFA <b>Cup</b> and the <b>Cup</b> Winners' <b>Cup</b> would play in the <b>Cup</b> Winners' <b>Cup.</b> Nevertheless, many commentators and fans regarded the <b>Cup</b> Winners' <b>Cup</b> as weaker than the UEFA <b>Cup,</b> which had more and better teams from the stronger European leagues.|$|R
25|$|Another {{practice}} {{was the use}} of pigeons when treating swellings. Swellings which were white in appearance and deep were unlikely to break and must be anointed with Oil of Lillies or Camomil. Once the swelling rises to a head and is red in appearance and not deep in the flesh, it can be broken {{with the use of a}} feather from a young pigeon's tail. The feather's fundament was held to the swelling and would draw out the venom. However, if the swelling dropped and became black in appearance since it had taken in coldness, the physician had to be cautious when drawing the cold from the swelling. If it was too late to prevent, the physician would take the young pigeon, cut her open from breast to back, break her open and apply the pigeon (while still alive) over the cold swelling. The <b>cupping</b> therapy was an alternative method which was heated and then placed over the swellings. Once the sore was broken, the physician would apply Mellilot Plaister with Linimentum Arcei and heal the sore with digence.|$|E
500|$|The {{inflorescence}} is an unbranched and indeterminate terminal raceme measuring [...] tall, {{with flowers}} that are yellow or white. Each flower has four petals {{set in a}} perpendicular pattern, as well as four sepals, six stamens, and a superior ovary that is two-celled and contains a single stigma and style. Two of the six stamens have shorter filaments. The fruit is a silique that opens at maturity through dehiscence to reveal brown or black seeds that are small and round in shape. Self-pollination is impossible, and plants are cross-pollinated by insects. The initial leaves form a rosette shape comprising 7 to 15 leaves, each measuring [...] by after this, leaves with shorter petioles develop and heads form through the leaves <b>cupping</b> inward.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, upon leaving church, Scalia {{was asked}} by a {{reporter}} whether being a traditionalist Catholic had caused problems for him, and he responded by asking, [...] "You know what I say to those people?" [...] and with a gesture, <b>cupping</b> his hand under his chin and flicking his fingers out. The gesture, which got captured by a photographer, was initially reported by the Boston Herald as obscene. Scalia responded to the reports with {{a letter to the}} editor, accusing the news staff of watching too many episodes of The Sopranos and stating that the gesture was a strong brush-off. Roger Axtell, an expert on body language, described the gesture as possibly meaning [...] "I've had enough, go away" [...] and noted, [...] "It's a fairly strong gesture". The gesture would later be parodied by comedian Stephen Colbert during his performance at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner later that year, with the justice in attendance: cameras showed that unlike most of the butts of Colbert's jokes that evening, Scalia was laughing.|$|E
