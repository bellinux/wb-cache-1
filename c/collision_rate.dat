5|$|After {{the second}} study {{resulted}} in no further movement toward divided highway construction, locals formed the County Residents Action for Safer Highways (CRASH) in response to the significantly higher collision rates along the two-lane sections of US113 compared to the state average. The high <b>collision</b> <b>rate,</b> which included 42 fatal crashes between 1980 and 1997, led CRASH to rally community support and intensely lobby MDSHA to expand US113 to four lanes. MDSHA responded in 1995 by initiating the US113 Planning Study, which recommended expanding US113 to a divided highway from Berlin to the Delaware state line and from Snow Hill to Berlin. The agency needed to persuade other involved agencies to make the proposed expansion their top priority, because at the time traffic volumes on the highway did not meet the thresholds beyond which the highway would need to be expanded to a four-lane divided highway.|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{comparison}} of numerically and experimentally determined collision kernels of water drops in air turbulence. The numerical and experimental setups are matched as closely as possible. However, due to the individual numerical and experimental restrictions, {{it could not be}} avoided that the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate of the measurement and the simulations differ. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are performed resulting in a very large database concerning geometric collision kernels with 1470 individual entries. Based on this database a fit function for the turbulent enhancement of the collision kernel is developed. In the experiments, the <b>collision</b> <b>rates</b> of large drops (radius > 7. 5 µm) are measured. These <b>collision</b> <b>rates</b> are compared with the developed fit, evaluated at the measurement conditions. Since the total <b>collision</b> <b>rates</b> match well for all occurring dissipation rates the distribution information of the fit could be used to enhance the statistical reliability {{and for the first time}} an experimental collision kernel could be constructed. In addition to the <b>collision</b> <b>rates,</b> the drop size distributions at three consecutive streamwise positions are measured. The drop size distributions contain mainly small drops (radius < 7. 5 µm). The measured evolution of the drop size distribution is confronted with model calculations based on the newly derived fit of the collision kernel. It turns out that the observed fast evolution of the drop size distribution can only be modeled if the collision kernel for small drops is drastically increased. A physical argument for this amplification is missing since for such small drops, neither DNSs nor experiments have been performed. For large drops, for which a good agreement of the <b>collision</b> <b>rates</b> was found in the DNS and the experiment, the time for the evolution of the spectrum in the wind tunnel is too short to draw any conclusion. Hence, the long-time evolution of the drop size distribution is presented in Riechelmann et?al. 2015 (doi: 10. 1127 /metz/ 2015 / 0608) ...|$|R
