50|$|Example: A bakery markets {{a single}} plain cookie for $2. However, {{they decide to}} {{introduce}} a new <b>chocolate</b> <b>chip</b> <b>cookie</b> for $3. The plain cookies made 100 sales a day before the <b>chocolate</b> <b>chip</b> <b>cookie</b> was launched. On {{the first month of}} launch, the <b>chocolate</b> <b>chip</b> <b>cookie</b> makes 50 sales a day. However the bakery should not expect to make $350, as what will most likely happen is that a portion of the people who bought the <b>chocolate</b> <b>chip</b> <b>cookie</b> will be plain cookie buyers who will have opted for the second product.
