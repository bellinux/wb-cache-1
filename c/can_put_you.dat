500|$|Much of {{the story}} is told by the songs, with the lyrics {{coordinating}} with the events {{of the story}}. For example, [...] "Don't You Want Me" [...] introduces the affair between Greg and Connie, allowing them to flirt in the presence of Fran. It pre-empts the result of their relationship with the line [...] "we will both be sorry"; this is unsung by the characters, but nonetheless emphasise in the episode. The song also speaks to the relationship between Greg and Roger, with Greg singing [...] "don't you want me?" [...] when he fears that he will be fired, and tells of Greg's character with lines including [...] "Don't forget it's me who put you where you are now // And I <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> back there too".|$|E
500|$|Abbott is the {{inventor}} of a style of maze called logic mazes. A logic maze has a set of rules, ranging from the basic (such as [...] "you cannot make left turns") to the extremely complicated. These mazes are also called [...] "Multi-State mazes". [...] The reason for this name is that sometimes you can return to a position you were in before, but be traveling in a different direction. That change in direction <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> in a different state and open up different choices for you. One example, from the book SuperMazes, would be a rolling-die maze. Where you can move from a particular square depends on what number is facing up on the die. If you return to that same square, the die {{may be in a}} different state, with a different number on top. Thus, you would have different options than the first time.|$|E
500|$|Although {{generally}} {{respected by}} London society, the longer Lambert remained there, the more irritable he became. Shy and self-conscious, he was annoyed at repeatedly being {{asked about the}} size of his clothes. [...] In answer to one request, to a woman who enquired as to the cost of his coat, he replied [...] "I cannot pretend to charge my memory with the price, but I <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> into a method of obtaining the information you want. If you think proper to make me a present of a new coat, you will then know exactly what it costs". [...] Another interested spectator claimed that since his entrance fee was paying for Lambert's clothing, he had the right to know about it; Lambert replied [...] "Sir, if I knew what part of my next coat your shilling would pay for, I can assure you I would cut out the piece". Lambert calculated in 1806 that a full suit of clothes cost him £20, about £ as of [...]|$|E

6000|$|... "What can I do for <b>you?</b> Where <b>can</b> I <b>put</b> <b>you?</b> I can't bear {{to see you}} here!" [...] said Christie, much {{afflicted by}} the {{spectacle}} before her.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are ever}} too sharp for us, in words, John. The damsel is younger than you, by full two years; {{and yet she}} <b>can</b> always <b>put</b> <b>you</b> in the wrong, with her tongue." ...|$|R
2500|$|I am very {{sensible}} {{that you}} are let into {{the knowledge of the}} intrigues of the compter, particularly with relation to the securing of pocket books. But your experience is inferior to mine... I <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> in a far better method than you are acquainted with... But I must first tell you that you'll spoil the trade of thief-taking in advancing greater rewards than are necessary. I give but half a crown a book... And when the thieves and pickpockets see us confederate they'll submit to our terms.Thus their partnership started taking Hitchen and his assistant first to Temple Bar, westernmost limit of his area of Jurisdiction. There marshal was revered with different [...] "fine" [...] drinks at different taverns, to which he only gave a brief sign asking for information on stolen goods. He was verbose, though, in his [...] "promises of protection" [...] to female visitors of those establishments:"I'll give you my word...you shall be detected, unless you deliver all the pocket books you from time to time meet with to me...If you at any time for the future, refuse to yield... either to me or my servant, you may be assured of being all sent to Bridewell... Wild gives an example of marshal's treatment of well-dressed women too. Once he seized a baillif's wife in the street in Ludgate Hill for talking to a man and accused her of being [...] "lewd". He took her to Cheapside and made her wait till he dined and pay for his meal. Pickpockets, or [...] "mathematicians" [...] as Hitchen called them affectionately", appear with a noteworthy incident in this period. On their regular night walks near St.Paul's, Hitchen and Wild saw the boys running away. Hitchen, having information on a stolen book, saw the reason of their hiding. He caught and arrested one, whose name was James Jones, the same juvenile who stole Lord Barnard's bills. The boy gave the address of his friends next morning before the justice and Hitchen took Wild to Barbican to attack their house during the night. The uninvited guests were welcomed with unfriendly 'damn ye', upon which the assistant Wild was left inside with the company while the marshal fled for bringing more constables. The gang of around 12 year-olds was taken and tried at Kingston assizes as their robbery was committed in Surrey. To the great disappointment and fury of marshal, court acquitted the boys upon their parents' complaint on marshal forcing their children to commit crime. He could not claim usual 40 pounds for their dead or alive heads. Moreover, was reprimanded by the court for the base interest. Wild gives very interesting account of the other side of Hitchen's relation to pickpockets we will mention below.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's my sister's way," [...] said Annie impartially. [...] "She's {{gone out}} {{for a bit of}} air, but I daresay she'll be back soon to finish. It's a nice light room when it's tidy. <b>Can</b> I <b>put</b> <b>you</b> a table over there?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{has been}} ever found there," [...] said Ilderim; [...] "nor is it his wont {{to turn his}} horse's head from any brave encounter. But it was not of the Soldan that I meant to speak. In a word, if it will content thee {{to be placed in}} such {{reputation}} as may be attained by detection of the thief who stole the Banner of England, I <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>thee</b> in a fair way of achieving this task--that is, if thou wilt be governed; for what says Lokman, 'If the child would walk, the nurse must lead him; if the ignorant would understand, the wise must instruct.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That depends so much upon you," [...] he replied. [...] "If {{you give}} me any encouragement, I <b>can</b> <b>put</b> before <b>you</b> a great proposition.

6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] Wrayson {{answered}} impatiently. [...] "You must be reasonable, {{my young}} friend.

6000|$|... "That must {{depend upon}} circumstances, Mary.

60|$|I wonder now if I <b>can</b> <b>put</b> before <b>you</b> {{very briefly}} the main generalizations that {{were growing up}} in my mind during my exile, the {{simplified}} picture into which I translated the billions of sights and sounds and--smells, for {{every part of the}} world has its distinctive olfactory palette as much as its palette of colors--that rained daily and nightly upon my mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "As things are, I {{can make}} no arrangement, and offer no advice. I <b>can</b> only <b>put</b> <b>you</b> confidentially in {{possession}} of my private opinion, leaving you entirely free to draw your own inferences from it, and regretting that I cannot write more confidently and more definitely than I have written here. All that I could conscientiously say on this very difficult and delicate subject, I have said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is so, Warbles. We can run {{straight}} together, {{or if we}} don't run together perhaps I <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> on to a line {{of country}} where you may make good running for yourself. You left England suddenly, I suppose?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As the law stands I cannot do that. But {{as you are}} luckily in orders, I <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> in--on this understanding, {{that you}} shall regard the income as {{belonging}} rather to your mother and to your sisters than to yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{let me see}} you {{sometimes}} up at my place in Abchurch Lane. I <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> more {{in the way of}} understanding things there than I can here. This is all a mere formal sort of thing. You can see that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was well}} done," [...] said the mayor, coming I back again; [...] "but tell me, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> my cart before my horse {{and take me}} to ride?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good Lord! I hadn't {{thought of}} that. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> {{a few things}} in a bag when she isn't looking, and sneak them down {{to me at the}} St. Aurea?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then I {{must leave}} you here while I {{go out and}} get you lodgings for the present,' Ronald said, quietly; 'you won't object to my doing that, of course: you can easily pay me back from your salary as soon as we succeed in finding you some {{suitable}} occupation.
