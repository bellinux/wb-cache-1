Successful in vivo correlation of the pharmacokinetics between <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostic</b> and the radiolabeled ADC allowed us to perform therapy studies allowing the precision prediction of responders and non-responders in small animal studies. In humans, ADC sensitivity likely depends on FRα expression.

40|$|Targeted, {{especially}} stratified or biomarker-guided, therapies offer significant {{advantages over}} traditional oncology therapies in certain settings. Selecting patients {{most likely to}} respond to a drug increases the therapeutic efficacy while reducing toxicities and may accelerate regulatory approval since smaller clinical trials are needed to demonstrate benefit. Several drugs, including vemurafenib and crizotinib have demonstrated these benefits along with commercial success. However, significant risk exists for the drug developer since approval may be threatened if they fail to meet unclear and differing yet parallel requirements for both the drug and the required <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostic.</b> Tumor biology is also increasingly complex since recent studies suggest that there are limited numbers of individual driver mutations, complicated interactions throughout signaling pathways as well as extensive tumor heterogeneity, all of which will challenge the effectiveness of targeted therapies. Clinical trial strategy decisions can greatly impact the success of a targeted therapy due to these challenges. While therapeutic efficacy is considered important, biomarker prevalence and <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostic</b> performance {{have been shown to be}} as important, yet more informative at the time decisions are made. I hypothesized that common prevalence and <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostic</b> performance thresholds are being used to guide biomarker-guided clinical trial strategy decisions for targeted oncology therapies. Seventeen interviews with preclinical, clinical or translational leads were conducted across a focused set of ten "pathway-modifying" cancer drug programs (CDK 4 / 6, MDM 2 and P 13 KP inhibitors) that reflect the biological complexity of future targeted therapies. These interviews provided empirical data as to how biomarkers are being incorporated into current clinical trial decisions. All respondents were planning to use a <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostic</b> for their program, however, the use of biomarkers varied significantly. For those programs with ongoing clinical trials in phase I and II, 54 % (n= 7 / 13) were pursuing a biomarker-guided strategy while 46 % (n= 6 / 13) were using an initial all-comers strategy. This fairly equal split separated when compared by phase where trials in phase I and 1 / 11, 60 % (n= 6 / 10) were using an all-comers strategy but for those trials in phase II (n= 3), all were using biomarker-guided strategies. A key finding of the interviews was that 66. 7 % (n= 4 / 6) were planning biomarker enrichment as part of expansion plans. Disproving my hypothesis, however, common thresholds for neither biomarker prevalence nor <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostic</b> performance were being used to guide these decisions. Biomarker prevalences of 50 - 100 % were stated as potentially appropriate for an all-comers strategy. <b>Companion</b> <b>diagnostic</b> performance thresholds were even less influential as only a few respondents provided a general range of desired sensitivity and specificity. This study found that actions of drug developers are not necessarily following the emerging recommendations for targeted therapies due to the significant challenges of biomarker and <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostic</b> development. by Heather Stacey Tomkinson Vital.

40|$|Rapid {{innovation}} in (epi) genetics and biomarker sciences is driving {{a new drug}} development and product development pathway, with the personalized medicine era dominated by biologic therapeutics and <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics.</b> <b>Companion</b> <b>diagnostics</b> (CDx) are tests and assays that detect biomarkers and specific mutations to elucidate disease pathways, stratify patient populations, and target drug therapies. CDx can substantially influence the development and regulatory approval for certain high-risk biologics. However, despite the increasingly important role of <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics</b> in the realization of personalized medicine, in the United States, there are only twenty-three Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics</b> {{on the market for}} eleven unique indications. Personalized medicines have great potential, yet their use is currently constrained. A major factor for this may lie in the increased complexity of the companion diagnostic and corresponding therapeutic development and adoption pathways. Understanding the market dynamics of companion diagnostic/therapeutic (CDx/Rx) pairs is important to further development and adoption of personalized medicine. Therefore, data collected on a variety of factors may highlight incentives or disincentives driving the development of <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics.</b> Statistical analysis for thirty-six hypotheses resulted in two significant relationships and thirty-four non-significant relationships. The sensitivity of the companion diagnostic was the only factor that significantly correlated with the price of the companion diagnostic.

The first <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics</b> were launched in the 1980 s and {{in the face of}} significant initial skepticism from drug developers as to whether segmenting a drug&# 39;s market through a diagnostic was advisable. The commercial success of drugs such as Herceptin® (trastuzumab) and Gleevec® (imatinib), which both require testing with <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics</b> before they can be prescribed, has moved the entire companion diagnostic field forward. From an initial start of a handful of oncology drugs with corresponding diagnostics, the field has expanded to include multiple therapeutic areas, and the number of combinations has grown by 12 -fold. Based on drugs in clinical trials, the rapid growth will likely continue for the foreseeable future. This expansion of <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics</b> will also have a global component as markets in Europe will evolve in a similar but not identical pattern as the US. One of the greatest challenges to future growth in <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics</b> is aligning the incentives of all stakeholders. A major driver of growth will continue to be the economic incentives for drug developers to pair their products with diagnostics. However, diagnostic companies are caught between the conflicting demands of two major stakeholders, pharmaceutical companies on one hand and payers/providers on the other. Regulators are also becoming more demanding in aligning development time lines between drugs and diagnostics. In order to survive and prosper, diagnostic companies will need to think more broadly about <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics</b> than the historical match between a specific drug and a single diagnostic. They will also have to continue the process of consolidation and global expansion that the industry has already begun. Despite these potential obstacles, <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics</b> have become one of the hottest areas of deal making in the diagnostic space in recent years, and the future trends continue to look bright.
