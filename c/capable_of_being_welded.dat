40|$|The {{continued}} {{drive for}} increased efficiency, performance and reduced costs for industrial gas turbine engines demands extended use of high strength-high temperature capability materials, such as nickel based superalloys. To {{satisfy the requirements}} of the component design and manufacturing engineers these materials must be <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>welded</b> in a satisfactory manner. The present paper describes the characteristic defects found as a result of welding the more difficult, highly alloyed materials and reviews a number of welding processes used in the manufacture and repair of nickel alloy components. These include gas tungsten arc (GTA) and electron beam (EB) welding, laser powder deposition and friction welding. Many of the more dilute nickel based alloys are readily weldable using conventional GTA processes, however, high strength, precipitation hardened materials are prone to heat affected zone and strain age cracking defect formation. A number of factors are found to affect the propensity for defects: composition (aluminium and titanium content), grain size, pre and post-weld heat treatment, as well as the welding process itself (control of heat input and traverse speed). Process parameter identification is still largely empirical and a fuller understanding of the joining processes is dependent upon the development and application of more sophisticated numerical modelling techniques. 1...|$|E
40|$|A high {{integrity}} can (HIC), {{designed to meet}} the ASME Boiler and High Pressure Vessel Code (Section III, Div. 3, static conditions) is proposed for the interim storage and repository disposal of Department of Energy (DOE) spent nuclear fuel. The HIC will be approximately 5 3 / 8 inches (134. 38 mm) in outside diameter with 1 / 4 inch (6. 35 mm) thick walls, and have a removable lid with a metallic seal that is <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>welded</b> shut. The opening of the can is approximately 4 3 / 8 inches (111. 13 mm). This HIC is primarily designed to contain items in the DOE SNF inventory that do not meet acceptance standards for direct disposal in a geologic repository. This includes fuel in the form of particulate dusts, sectioned pieces of fuel, core rubble, melted or degraded (non-intact) fuel elements, unclad uranium alloys, metallurgical specimens, and chemically reactive fuel components. The HIC is intended to act as a substitute cladding for the spent nuclear fuel, further isolate problematic materials, provide a long-term corrosion barrier, and add an extra internal pressure barrier for the waste package. The HIC will also delay potential fission product release and maintain geometry control for extended periods of time. For the entire disposal package to be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a HIC must effectively eliminate the disposal problems associated with problem SNF including the release of radioactive and/or reactive material and over pressurization of the HIC due to chemical reactions within the can. Two HICs were analyzed to envelop a range of can lengths between 42 and 101 inches. Using Abacus software, the HIC's were analyzed for end, side, and corner drops. Hastelloy C- 22 was chosen based upon structural integrity, corrosion resistance, and neutron absorption properties...|$|E
