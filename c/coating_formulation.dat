50|$|Coated {{paper is}} paper {{which has been}} coated by a {{compound}} or polymer to impart certain qualities to the paper, including weight, surface gloss, smoothness or reduced ink absorbency. Various materials, including Kaolinite, calcium carbonate, Bentonite, and talc {{can be used to}} coat paper for high quality printing used in packaging industry and in magazines. The chalk or china clay is bound to the paper with synthetic viscosifiers, such as styrene-butadiene latexes and natural organic binders such as starch.

50|$|In {{water-borne}} coatings, an aqueous polymer dispersion {{creates a}} {{film on the}} substrate once the solvent has evaporated. Surface functionalization of the polymer particles is {{a key component of}} a <b>coating</b> <b>formulation</b> allowing control over such properties as dispersion, film formation temperature, and the coating rheology. Dispersing aids often involve steric or electrostatic repulsion of the polymer particles, providing colloidal stability. The dispersing aids adsorb (as in a grafting onto scheme) onto latex particles giving them functionality. The association of other additives, such as thickeners shown in the schematic to the right, with adsorbed polymer material give rise to complex rheological behavior and excellent control over a coating's flow properties.|$|E

Site Applied UV Coatings are available in both 100% solid and water-based formulations. They offer the advantage of quick return to service in the case of substrates such as wood, where polyurethanes can take several days before achieving full cure, and longevity in applications such as VCT, where an acrylic finish can be reapplied several times per year and buffed routinely. The coatings are applied as traditional coatings and then cured with an ultraviolet light (Generally either a mercury discharge lamp or LED-based system) mounted to a rolling chassis or by a handheld unit.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{successful}} Zeppelin was the Graf Zeppelin. It flew {{over one million}} miles, including an around-the-world flight in August 1929. However, {{the dominance of the}} Zeppelins over the airplanes of that period, which had a range of only a few hundred miles, was diminishing as airplane design advanced. The [...] "Golden Age" [...] of the airships ended on May 6, 1937 when the Hindenburg caught fire, killing 36 people. The cause of the Hindenburg accident was initially blamed on the use of hydrogen instead of helium as the lift gas. An internal investigation by the manufacturer revealed the coating used to protect the covering material over the frame was highly flammable and allowed static electricity to build up in the airship. Changes to the <b>coating</b> <b>formulation</b> reduced the risk of further Hindenburg type accidents. Although there have been periodic initiatives to revive their use, airships have seen only niche application since that time.|$|E
5000|$|Mottling {{can also}} refer to an {{undesirable}} defect which can occur with effect coatings, most obvious on light metallic finishes. The total color impression shows irregular areas of lightness variations. These [...] "patches" [...] are usually visually evaluated, {{described as a}} mottling effect. Some also feel that it reminds them of clouds. This effect is especially noticeable on large body panels. It {{can be caused by}} the <b>coating</b> <b>formulation,</b> as well as variations in the application process. For example, disorientation of the metallic flakes or film thickness variations of the basecoat can lead to various mottle sizes resulting in a non-uniform appearance. The visual perception of mottling is dependent on the viewing distance: Large mottles can be seen in far distance evaluation, while small mottles are more noticeable in close up evaluation. The visual evaluation of mottling is very subjective, as it dependson the illumination conditions, the observing distance and the viewing angle.|$|E

Recently, an enteric <b>coated</b> <b>formulation</b> of cysteamine bitartrate (RP 103) administered twice daily was demonstrated to be non-inferior for lowering WBC cystine levels compared to the non-enteric <b>coated</b> <b>formulation</b> (Cystagon(R)), administered 4 times per day. Since both formulations had different pharmacokinetic profiles, we compared DMS breath levels after administration of either RP 103 or Cystagon(R) in four cystinosis patients. Although cysteamine areas under the curve (AUCs) were comparable, AUC of DMS was lower after the administration of RP 103 compared to Cystagon(R). This observation is of importance in cystinosis patients, since halitosis hampers compliance with cysteamine therapy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Gradual {{substitution}} of anticorrosive <b>coating</b> <b>formulations</b> revealing hazardous {{effects on the}} environment by eco-friendly ones is nowadays an ongoing trend in the coating industry.

40|$|A novel corn-zein coating {{structure}} on polypropylene (PP) films {{was developed to}} examine its feasibility as an alternative water vapor and oxygen-barrier for flexible packaging industry. The barrier properties of the resulting films were evaluated as affected by <b>coating</b> <b>formulation</b> (solvent, corn-zein, plasticizer concentration and plasticizer type). Corn-zein with different amounts (5 % and 15 %) was dissolved in 70 % and 95 % aqueous ethanol solution at 50 °C, respectively. Solutions of corn-zein plasticized by polyethylene glycol (PEG) and glycerol (GLY) with various levels (20 % and 50 %) were applied on corona-discharged-treated PP by using solvent-casting method. The significant improvements in water vapor and oxygen-barrier properties of uncoated PP films were obtained with corn-zein coating. Water vapor permeability (WVP) of the coated films decreased significantly with increasing corn-zein concentration. The application of plasticized corn-zein coating on PP films showed nearly more than three order of reduction in oxygen permeability (OP). The high water vapor and oxygen-barriers were obtained for films coated with <b>coating</b> <b>formulation</b> consisting of higher amounts of corn-zein plasticized by GLY.

They are acrylic-vinyl acetate copolymer {{in the form}} of acrylic paint and modified acrylic polymer, NeoCryl A- 45 (trade name product of Zeneca Specialties Pte Ltd),with the solid content of 37. 5 %. The results showed that the optimum total solid content for a <b>coating</b> <b>formulation</b> was in a range of 4. 7 to 5. 7 %. Dimethyl siloxane was used in a formulation to decrease surface friction coefficient. Optimum level of dimethyl siloxane was 1. 50 g.

In comparisons between the use of two types of acrylic polymers, it was found that <b>coating</b> <b>formulation</b> using NeoCryl A- 45 provided better coated gloves quality in terms of tensile strength, 500 % modulus and elongation at break. This is attributed to the ability of acrylic polymer to promote adhesion to rubber surface and to provide high flexibility to the coated rubber gloves. Influence of ration of DPNR-g-PMMA to NeoCryl A- 45 was also studied. The results showed that rations of 1 : 2 and 2 : 1 gave high quality coated rubber gloves.
