40|$|Optimal <b>cut</b> <b>plans</b> for cutter suction {{dredgers}} aim {{to maximize}} operational efficiency. Maximizing operational efficiency involves minimization of stoppage time resulting from non-productive dredger movements. To automate a systematic search for optimal twodimensional <b>cut</b> <b>plans</b> for cutter suction dredgers two models with an adaptive simulated annealing-based solution approach were developed. The first model, the dredge cut nesting model, optimizes irregular stock cutting problems where stencils represent dredge cuts and sheets represent dredging areas. Stencils are collections of unit dredge cuts with dimensions {{related to an}} effective cutting width which can be achieved with the cutter suction dredger considered. The objectives of the dredge cut nesting model are to maximize sheet coverage and to minimize stencil overlap. Centroids of unit dredge cuts of final nest layouts are extracted and used as grid nodes in the second model. The second model, the dredger routing model, optimizes asymmetric travelling salesperson problems with turning costs. The objectives of the dredger routing model are to minimize total route length and sum of turning angles, and to maximize average link length. A link consists {{of two or more}} route edges which are aligned with each other to within specified limits. A significant result of this research is that an engineering application of both models showed that two-dimensional <b>cut</b> <b>plans</b> for cutter suction dredgers can be systematically optimized and that dredger routes with minimum turning costs can be found. However, results also showed that the dredger routing model is not yet sophisticated enough to find <b>cut</b> <b>plans</b> for cutter suction dredgers for which overall project execution time is minimal.

50|$|Ross also {{proposed}} a major {{overhaul of the}} state’s personal income tax structure and said the plan {{would have to be}} phased in over time as allowed by the state’s finances. The total price tag of the restructuring would cost an estimated $574.5 million, according to the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. Ross said his tax <b>cut</b> <b>plan,</b> when fully implemented, would cut income taxes by as much as $465 for incomes at $30,000; $665 at $40,000; $880 at $50,000; and, $1,148 at $75,000 and up. He proposed mimicking Gov. Mike Beebe’s phase-out of the sales tax on groceries as his blueprint for restructuring the tax code. Ross said, “I want to modernize our income tax code in a way that means lower, fairer taxes for working families and small businesses in Arkansas, and I want to do so in a fiscally responsible way that maintains our balanced budget and protects vital state services like education, Medicaid and public safety,” Ross said. “Just like Governor Beebe did with the sales tax on groceries, I will also gradually phase in my tax <b>cut</b> <b>plan</b> as the state can afford to do so.” The crux of Ross’ plan would be to retroactively index Arkansas income tax brackets taking a 1997 state law and applying it to the 1971 realignment of the tax code. Act 328 of 1997 tied state income tax brackets to inflation on a forward-going basis.|$|E

50|$|Economic growth, though positive, has {{not been}} {{sufficient}} to generate jobs and prevent unemployment from rising. In fact,there {{are now more than}} two million fewer private sector jobs than {{at the start of the}} current recession. Overcapacity,corporate scandals, and uncertainty have and will continue to weigh down the economy.The tax <b>cut</b> <b>plan</b> proposed by President Bush is not the answer to these problems. Regardless of how one views the specificsof the Bush plan, there is wide agreement that its purpose is a permanent change in the tax structure and not the creationof jobs and growth in the near-term. The permanent dividend tax cut, in particular, is not credible as a short-term stimulus.As tax reform, the dividend tax cut is misdirected in that it targets individuals rather than corporations, is overlycomplex, and could be, but is not, part of a revenue-neutral tax reform effort.Passing these tax cuts will worsen the long-term budget outlook, adding to the nation’s projected chronic deficits. Thisfiscal deterioration will reduce the capacity of the government to finance Social Security and Medicare benefits as well asinvestments in schools, health, infrastructure, and basic research. Moreover, the proposed tax cuts will generate furtherinequalities in after-tax income.To be effective, a stimulus plan should rely on immediate but temporary spending and tax measures to expand demand,and it should also rely on immediate but temporary incentives for investment. Such a stimulus plan would spur growthand jobs in the short term without exacerbating the long-term budget outlook.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a non-uniform layered rough <b>cut</b> <b>plan</b> for B-spline surfaces using convex hull boxes. The tool path plan generated by this method will rapidly remove most redundant material from stock material without overcutting. First, a B-spline surface is decomposed into piecewise Bezier surfaces, of which the convex hull boxes form an approximate model for rough cutting. Then, according to the top planes of those convex hull boxes, the stock material is divided into layers of different thickness. The cavity contour for each layer is obtained using a simplified union Boolean operation on convex hull boxes. Finally, from the top down, each layer is processed like a 2 D pocket die cavity. The algorithm is implemented on a personal computer. It is shown that the rough <b>cut</b> <b>plan</b> is very efficient since no computation for solving nonlinear equations is needed, and no overcutting occurs since B-spline surfaces are protected by the convex hull property of Bezier surfaces...|$|E

From Gemini CAD, we have taken different solutions of lay plans and chose the three best of them (lay plans that have a smaller number of lies, plies etc.), and then, for three best solutions are calculated lay indicators. From this calculation, we have determined the best solution of lay plan. The order to study has 5 different fabrics, so the calculations are made for each of them, and in the end are combined, in a way to have conclusions for an order in general. Best solution of lay plans combination, resulted one which had a better weighted efficiency and a low lay consumption...|$|E
40|$|The government’s 10 -year company tax <b>cut</b> <b>plan</b> was {{announced}} in the May 2016 budget, but {{was always going to}} be difficult to sell as an urgently needed reform. Since then, the debate has effectively shown that there is nothing in it that would increase the incentive to invest. This reflects the role of dividend imputation which acts like a withholding tax for dividend recipients. That means that any cut in company tax would thereby reduce the amount withheld on behalf of dividend recipients and so increase the amount shareholders will have to ‘top up’ at tax time. These arguments do not apply to foreigners who will unambiguously benefit from Australian company tax cuts. We contend that recognition of the role of foreign investors has caused the Treasurer to downplay any domestic considerations but instead concentrate on the role of foreign investment. Hence foreign investment is presented as a ‘must have’ and the company tax cuts become necessary to encourage foreign investment. Others such as former Prime Minister Paul Keating see it as ridiculous that Australia contemplates giving a large sum of money to foreigners. The rest of this paper examines whether indeed a company tax cut is likely to boost foreign investment in Australia...|$|E
