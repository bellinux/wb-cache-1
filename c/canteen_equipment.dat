50|$|In the 1950s these mobile blood {{units were}} very efficient, {{with a large}} Red Cross truck Manned only by two men, {{arriving}} at an empty location and setting {{up for the first}} donation which would be taken only two hours later. The Truck would be loaded with at least ten beds, mattresses, dozens of screens and chairs, waste receptacles, tables, stools, huge refrigerated boxes, can-vas bags of ice, coffee urns, gallons of orange juice, buckets, <b>canteen</b> <b>equipment,</b> Hundreds of blood bottles, boxes of sterile supplies, bottles of solution, literature and record forms, oxygen tanks, and sheets only to which the men would have unloaded and set up on site in less than 1 hour. Once set up is complete nurses, volunteers and Doctors Arrive on site to get dressed into uniforms. There were normally 6 nurses and 15 volunteers, the Nurses would do their preliminary task while the volunteers would split off into groups. One group would unpack and set up the reception ready to record details of some 200 donors over 6 hours. Another group would set up the canteen can prepare food for after donations. The third group will set up the blood bottle table where the blood would be tagged numbered and recorded. From there the site has now been set up ready to take donations.|$|E
