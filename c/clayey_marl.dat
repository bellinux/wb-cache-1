50|$|Somewhat {{outside the}} village, beyond the Odenbach, {{lying on the}} left side of a farm lane leading to Cronenberg, are some 40 {{mountain}} cellars. When agriculture underwent profound changes in the latter half of the 18th century through measures instituted by the insightful Duke Christian IV of Palatinate-Zweibrücken, particularly the measures involving growing potatoes and mangelwurzels, storage space also had to be found for this produce. In the village itself, hardly a house with a cellar was to be found. The only way out of this dearth of storage room was to dig these mountain cellars. The <b>clayey</b> <b>marl</b> on the slope of the forest path was best suited to this task. Skilled miners, many of whom were available in the village at the time, set to work digging many cellars. One peculiarity that these cellars can claim is their ownership history. Nowhere is it written down who owned each one, neither in any register nor in any cadastral survey. Ownership was simply assumed and acknowledged informally.|$|E

40|$|The Eocene flysh in {{the region}} of Split (Dalmatia, Croatia) is char¬acterized by the {{presence}} of layers with different characteristics. It mainly includes thin-layered <b>marls,</b> <b>clayey</b> <b>marls,</b> calcareous marls, clastic lay¬ered limestones, calcarenites and breccias. Those parts that can be de¬scribed as the soft rocks or hard clays by the mechanical means, exposed to weathering reduce the durability within "an engineering time scale". The paper deals with the factors that influence the weathering process. The analyzed weathering is a combination of processes acting simulta¬neously. Most of these processes depend on the change of the water con¬tent, thus the weathering process mainly develops when a material is subjected to the wetting-drying process, On the base of these results form of degradation process is modeled. The weathering process can be main¬ly described as physical weathering combined with chemical weathering on the free surfaces and on the cracks walls. Erosion as a result of weath¬ering, is the dominant geomorphic process on analyzed flysch terrain. According to the analysis, as the most appropriate due to the characteris¬tics the tests are chosen as index properties. Some of these tests are modified in order to adapt them to the determined characteristics of ma¬terials from flysch layers. The correlations between the measured values are used {{as the basis for the}} classification proposal of the analyzed mate¬rial, according to its resistance to weathering processes. Roughly, three main groups of samples are recognizable: the first one with carbonate content more then 90 % is not weathered at the engineers time scale; the second group with carbonate content from 75 % to 90 % include samples susceptible to weathering in engineers time scale; the third group with carbonate content less then 75 % include samples in which the weather¬ing occurs immediately after the exposition to the weathering factors...|$|R

In that sector of Sardinia {{underground}} waters constitute the most important water resource for agriculture. In Sinis area two deep aquifers have been placed. The first, placed in the western part, is constituted by sands and gravels and it is overhung by a very thick <b>clayey</b> <b>marl’s</b> layer. The water yeld of the confined aquifer has been determined by pumping tests from which it results that the pumping rate varies between 6 and 13. 5 l/sec. The average Transmissivity is 1. 7 x 10 - 3 m 2 /s. The other aquifer system, already known and studied for a long time, belongs to the alluvial multilayered aquifer of Campidano. It is constituted by very permeable layers of sands and gravels alternated to impervious or semi confining silty clay layers. The Transmissivity of this aquifer results superior to 10 - 3 m 2 /sec.

40|$|Abstract. – Integrated biostratigraphic and palaeoenvironmental {{analyses}} of foraminiferal, ostracod and calcareous nannofossil assemblages {{were carried out}} on the Messinian/Zanclean succession of the Moncucco quarry (Piedmont, northwestern Italy). The uppermost Messinian deposits may be correlated to the “Lago-Mare ” deposits of the Mediterra-nean area. They yield a brackish ostracod assemblage, which belongs to the Loxocorniculina djafarovi zone of the Messinian post-evaporitic interval, indicating their deposition in oligo-mesohaline shallow waters and the influx of Paratethyan faunas. Only reworked marine microfossils are present. The boundary between the “Lago-Mare ” deposits and the overlying Zanclean Argille Azzurre Fm. is marked by an irregular erosional surface, followed by a barren, 10 - 50 cm thick, black arenitic layer. The Zanclean succession consists of grey to whitish <b>clayey</b> <b>marls</b> (Argille Azzurre Fm.), rich in microfossils, which document the MPl 1 (Sphaeroidinellopsis acme) zone up to the MPl 4 a foraminiferal zone, and the MNN 12 to MNN 14 - 15 calcareous nannofossil zones.

The ERT technique is used to delineate the contamination, to detect the buried objects, and to quantify some aquifer properties. Eight 2 -D (two dimensional) electrical resistivity sections were measured using two different configurations (dipole–dipole and Wenner). The spread length is of 96 m and the electrodes spacing are 2, 4 and 6 m, respectively to reach a depth ranging from 13 to 17 m. The results indicate that, the subsurface section is divided into main three geo-electrical units, the first is fractured marl and limestone which exhibits high resistivity values ranging from 40 to 300 ohmm. The second unit is corresponding to marl of moderate resistivity values and the third unit, which is the deeper unit, exhibits very low resistivity values corresponding to <b>clayey</b> <b>marl.</b> The fourth layer is marly clay with water. The presence of clay causes the most geotechnical problems. Fourteen shallow seismic sections (both for P-wave and MASW) were carried out using spread of 94 m and geophone spacing of 2 m for each P-wave section. The results demonstrate that the deduced subsurface section consists of four layers, the first layer exhibits very low P-wave velocity ranging from 280 to 420 m/s, the second layer reveals P-wave velocity ranging from 400 to 1200 m/s, the third layer has P-wave velocity ranging from 970 to 2000 m/s and the fourth layer exhibits high velocity ranging from 1900 to 3600 m/s.

40|$|The Pianosa Island {{is one of}} {{the seven}} islands of the Tuscan Archipelago, {{particularly}} known for its typical flat morphological structure. It is formed by Neogenic-Quaternary sedimentary rocks, mainly represented by superficial calcarenite and underlying marl and <b>clayey</b> <b>marl.</b> Despite the small extension of the island (just 10, 2 km 2 wide, coastal perimeter of approximately 18 km, maximum altitude of 29 m a. s. l.) and poor rainfall amount (the annual average is 480, 7 mm in 1951 - 2002 period), the Pianosa aquifer is characterized by significant groundwater resources, which supported the presence of approximately 2, 000 people at the end of Eighties. Nevertheless, the groundwater overexploitation and the land use (agricultural activity and cattle-breeding, associated to the local penal settlement activity) caused important sea-water intrusion and pollution phenomena. An improvement of such situation occurs since 1998, owing to the closing of the penal settlement and its activities. This pilot research intends to describe the hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical features of the Pianosa Island aquifer system and the groundwater quality several years after the penal settlement closing. The results of a multidisciplinary approach (hydrogeological, geochemical, isotopic) show that the groundwater recharge and circulation are substantially controlled by the hydro-structural conditions. The flat and permeable superficial calcarenite allows a high infiltration rate. The water table flow direction is generally W-E, in accordance with the dip direction of the stratigraphic contact between the calcarenite and the underlying impermeable marly-clayey rocks. However, the latter present conglomerate and sandstone intercalations, sometimes in contact (by angular unconformity) with the calcarenite, determining a general continuity in groundwater circulation, which is phreatic in the calcarenite, and confined in the conglomerate and sandstone horizons. A piezometric depression with values below the sea level has been identified {{in the eastern part of}} the island. The electric conductivity (EC) map confirms this hydrogeological structure. EC values above 1. 000 μS/cm are common in almost all the groundwater analyzed. An increase in groundwater salinity is observable in the eastern part of Pianosa, where the water table depression has been recognized. In agreement with the hydro-structural and water table conditions, the hydrogeochemical analyses confirm the recharge of the confined horizons (conglomerate and sandstone) by the superficial calcarenite. The isotopic data indicate that the aquifer system is recharged by the rainfall direct infiltration and there are not connections with the close Elba Island. Finally, the chemical analyses of most groundwater samples suggest an intermediate facies Na-Cl/Ca-HCO 3, produced by the combination of the sea spray and the circulation in a prevalently carbonate aquifer (calcarenite). Clearly Na-Cl groundwater prevails in the eastern portion of the island, evidencing the seawater intrusion in the calcarenite, also confirmed by water table conditions and isotopic data...|$|E

40|$|In the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman marl {{forms the}} primary {{sediment}} cover, {{particularly on the}} Iranian side. A detailed quantitative description of the sediment components > 63 µ has been attempted {{in order to establish}} the regional distribution of the most important constituents as well as the criteria governing marl sedimentation in general. During the course of the analysis, the sand fraction from about 160 bottom-surface samples was split into 5 phi° fractions and 500 to 800 grains were counted in each individual fraction. The grains were cataloged in up to 40 grain type catagories. The gravel fraction was counted separately and the values calculated as weight percent. Basic for understanding the mode of formation of the marl sediment is the "rule" of independent availability of component groups. It states that the sedimentation of different component groups takes place independently, and that variation in the quantity of one component is independent of {{the presence or absence of}} other components. This means, for example, that different grain size spectrums are not necessarily developed through transport sorting. In the Persian Gulf they are more likely the result of differences in the amount of clay-rich fine sediment brought in to the restricted mouth areas of the Iranian rivers. These local increases in clayey sediment dilute the autochthonous, for the most part carbonate, coarse fraction. This also explains the frequent facies changes from carbonate to <b>clayey</b> <b>marl.</b> The main constituent groups of the coarse fraction are faecal pellets and lumps, the non carbonate mineral components, the Pleistocene relict sediment, the benthonic biogene components and the plankton. Faecal pellets and lumps are formed through grain size transformation of fine sediment. Higher percentages of these components can be correlated to large amounts of fine sediment and organic C. No discernable change takes place in carbonate minerals as a result of digestion and faecal pellet formation. The non-carbonate sand components originate from several unrelated sources and can be distinguished by their different grain size spectrum; as well as by other characteristics. The Iranian rivers supply the greatest amounts (well sorted fine sand). Their quantitative variations can be used to trace fine sediment transport directions. Similar mineral maxima in the sediment of the Gulf of Oman mark the path of the Persian Gulf outflow water. Far out from the coast, the basin bottoms in places contain abundant relict minerals (poorly sorted medium sand) and localized areas of reworked salt dome material (medium sand to gravel). Wind transport produces only a minimal "background value" of mineral components (very fine sand). Biogenic and non-biogenic relict sediments can be placed in separate component groups with the help of several petrographic criteria. Part of the relict sediment (well sorted fine sand) is allochthonous and was derived from the terrigenous sediment of river mouths. The main part (coarse, poorly sorted sediment), however, was derived from the late Pleistocene and forms a quasi-autochthonous cover over wide areas which receive little recent sedimentation. Bioturbation results in a mixing of the relict sediment with the overlying younger sediment. Resulting vertical sediment displacement of more than 2. 5 m has been observed. This vertical mixing of relict sediment is also partially responsible for the present day grain size anomalies (coarse sediment in deep water) found in the Persian Gulf. The mainly aragonitic components forming the relict sediment show a finely subdivided facies pattern reflecting the paleogeography of carbonate tidal flats dating from the post Pleistocene transgression. Standstill periods are reflected at 110 - 125 m (shelf break), 64 - 61 m and 53 - 41 m (e. g. coare grained quartz and oolite concentrations), and at 25 - 30 m. Comparing these depths to similar occurrences on other shelf regions (e. g. Timor Sea) leads to the conclusion that at this time minimal tectonic activity was taking place in the Persian Gulf. The Pleistocene climate, as evidenced by the absence of Iranian river sediment, was probably drier than the present day Persian Gulf climate. Foremost among the benthonic biogene components are the foraminifera and mollusks. When a ratio is set up between the two, it can be seen that each group is very sensitive to bottom type, i. e., the production of benthonic mollusca increases when a stable (hard) bottom is present whereas the foraminifera favour a soft bottom. In this way, regardless of the grain size, areas with high and low rates of recent sedimentation can be sharply defined. The almost complete absence of mollusks in water deeper than 200 to 300 m gives a rough sedimentologic water depth indicator. The sum of the benthonic foraminifera and mollusca was used as a relative constant reference value for the investigation of many other sediment components. The ratio between arenaceous foraminifera and those with carbonate shells shows a direct relationship to the amount of coarse grained material in the sediment as the frequence of arenaceous foraminifera depends heavily on the availability of sand grains. The nearness of "open" coasts (Iranian river mouths) is directly reflected in the high percentage of plant remains, and indirectly by the increased numbers of ostracods and vertebrates. Plant fragments do not reach their ultimate point of deposition in a free swimming state, but are transported along with the remainder of the terrigenous fine sediment. The echinoderms (mainly echinoids in the West Basin and ophiuroids in the Central Basin) attain their maximum development at the greatest depth reached by the action of the largest waves. This depth varies, depending on the exposure of the slope to the waves, between 12 to 14 and 30 to 35 m. Corals and bryozoans have proved to be good indicators of stable unchanging bottom conditions. Although bryozoans and alcyonarian spiculae are independent of water depth, scleractinians thrive only above 25 to 30 m. The beginning of recent reef growth (restricted by low winter temperatures) was seen only in one single area - on a shoal under 16 m of water. The coarse plankton fraction was studied primarily through the use of a plankton-benthos ratio. The increase in planktonic foraminifera with increasing water depth is here heavily masked by the "Adjacent sea effect" of the Persian Gulf: for the most part the foraminifera have drifted in from the Gulf of Oman. In contrast, the planktonic mollusks are able to colonize the entire Persian Gulf water body. Their amount in the plankton-benthos ratio always increases with water depth and thereby gives a reliable picture of local water depth variations. This holds true to a depth of around 400 m (corresponding to 80 - 90 % plankton). This water depth effect can be removed by graphical analysis, allowing the percentage of planktonic mollusks per total sample to be used as a reference base for relative sedimentation rate (sedimentation index). These values vary between 1 and > 1000 and thereby agree well with all the other lines of evidence. The "pteropod ooze" facies is then markedly dependent on the sedimentation rate and can theoretically develop at any depth greater than 65 m (proven at 80 m). It should certainly no longer be thought of as "deep sea" sediment. Based on the component distribution diagrams, grain size and carbonate content, the sediments of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman can be grouped into 5 provisional facies divisions (Chapt. 19). Particularly noteworthy among these are first, the fine grained <b>clayey</b> <b>marl</b> facies occupying the 9 narrow outflow areas of rivers, and second, the coarse grained, high-carbonate marl facies rich in relict sediment which covers wide sediment-poor areas of the basin bottoms. Sediment transport is for the most part restricted to grain sizes < 150 µ and in shallow water is largely coast-parallel due to wave action at times supplemented by tidal currents. Below the wave base gravity transport prevails. The only current capable of moving sediment is the Persian Gulf outflow water in the Gulf of Oman...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWithin the {{framework}} of a research project launched to assess the feasibility of seismic monitoring of underground growing cavities, this specific work focus on the analysis of the induced microseismicity generated by a controlled pressure experiment recently carried out in a salt mine environment. A local seismic array has been installed over a stable underground cavity within a salt layer located in the Lorraine basin (north-east France). The array includes four 3 D components and three 1 D component geophones deployed at depths between 30 m to 125 m in cemented boreholes drilled {{in the vicinity of the}} study area. The underground cavity under monitoring is located within a salt layer at 180 m depth and it presents a rather irregular shape that can be approximated by a cylindrical volume of 50 m height and 180 m diameter. Presently, the cavity fully saturated with brine inducing a significant pressure on its walls (~ 2. 5 MPa) to keep the overburden mechanically stable. Nevertheless some small microsesimic events were recorded by the array and analysed (~ 500 events in two years of recording). In October 2005, a controlled pressure transient experiment has been carried out in the cavity in order to analyse the mechanical response of the overburden by tracking the induced microseismicity. The recorded events are mainly grouped in clusters of 3 to 30 seconds of signal duration with non-emergent first arrivals and rather low frequency content (between 20 to 120 Hz). Some of these events have been spatially located by travel-time picking close to the actual cavity and its immediate roof. Preliminary spectral analysis suggests sources possibly related to resonant fluid-filled cracks, and/or cavitations due to the dynamic excitation of the brine-filled cavity. Rock-debris falling into the cavity from delamination of <b>clayey</b> <b>marls</b> in the immediate roof is possibly another source of seismic excitation. No clear evidence of classical brittle ruptures in the competent layers of the overburden has been observed up to now.

The species enjoys much attention in silviculture, but is rarely planted. The height growth of wild service tree is approximately as that of oak, i. e. fast in youth, later stagnant (Box 1 and Figure 3 (numbers indicate site index or height at age 100 years, black = wild service tree, red = oak, green = beech)). In Denmark wild service tree typically achieves a height of 15 - 17 m in 100 years (based on measurements of old trees in the forests at Ulvshale (Møn) and Døndalen (Bornholm) and in the Arboretum at Charlottenlund (Copenhagen), see Box 2). This is similar to the growth rate on sites of low productivity in Germany...|$|R
30|$|To {{the southwestern}} {{part of the}} Thrace Basin, the Ergene Formation (Holmes, 1961) begins with {{different}} strati-graphic units on the deposits of the Enez Formation and the Paleogene basement units. South of Pehlivanköy, east of Ipsala and Meriç (Fig. 2 (b)), the Ergene Formation starts with carbonate, carbonate-cemented sandstones and continues with weakly-cemented and cross-bedded sandstones containing lensoidal channel-fill conglomerates. Also, south of Çöpköy and Dereköy, and around Ibriktepe (Fig. 2 (b)), the succession begins with coarse conglomerates. In many places, the conglomerates contain blocks of metamorphic rocks and Paleogene sandy limestone. The blocks {{range in size from}} 5 to 70 cm and are embedded in a pebbly-sandy matrix. The blocky deposits of the Ergene Formation, which are located in close proximity to NE-trending faults (Fig. 2 (b)), are interpreted as fan deposits with associated river channel fills (Elmas et al., 2008). Similar units are also observed in the east and south of the study area to the north of Malkara and south of Kesan (Fig. 2 (b)). The blocky deposits pass upward into a sequence of fine sandstone, silt-stone, <b>clayey</b> limestone and <b>marl.</b> Mammal fauna, collected from several parts of the sequence, indicates a Late Miocene age (Ünay and de Bruijn, 1984; Umut et al., 1984).|$|R

40|$|Most of the Eocene flysch clastite bedrocks in {{the wider}} area {{of the city of}} Kaštela near Split are {{urbanized}} and densely populated. Northern parts of the flysch terrain are mainly covered with thin rockfall breccia and other slope material originated from the Mesozoic carbonate overthrust nappe. Therefore, there are very lim-ited possibilities for outcrop research. On the other side, {{in the last several years}} geotechnical investigations and construction of infrastructural projects enabled us to identify some engineering geological properties and problems of the flysch complex. The obtained facts and numbers will be incorporated into the Basic Engi-neering Geological map of Croatia in the scale of 1 : 100, 000. The flysch in wider area is comprised of limestone breccia, calcirudites, calcarenites, <b>marl,</b> <b>clayey</b> limestones and rarely of large limestone olistolithe blocks. The investigated area is mainly built of marl with local inter-bedding of calcitic siltstone, calcarenite and clayey limestone. In general, lower part of the apparently 800 m thick flysch complex is dominantly built of coarser grained clastites. According to the available laboratory, geophysical, borehole and limited surface data several conclusions can be made. Based on dominant component at least two flysch types can be identified. Marly type of flysch with dominant properties of marl and clay rich marl with rare coarser grained interbeds, is characterized by mil...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Struganik {{limestone}} {{has been}} increasingly popular {{in recent years}} for interior and exterior building applications, due to easy workability, low cost and multi purpose suitability. The quality of limestone is determined by its mineralogical and textural characteristics and physico-mechanical properties. The Struganik stone corresponds to <b>marl,</b> <b>clayey</b> limestone and limestone (micritic and allochemical). The lime-stone is commonly layered, either thinly bedded or banked.

40|$|The Ceylan Formation (upper Eocene) {{from the}} Thrace Basin (Gelibolu Peninsula, NW Turkey), is {{composed}} of pelagic shales, <b>marls,</b> <b>clayey</b> limestones, turbiditic sandstone-shale beds and local conglomerates, debris flow mixtites, slumped deposits and silicified tuffites. These deposits, which are about 1000 m thick, generally shallow upwards, show vertical and lateral changes according to their accumulation on different parts of a submarine slope, with a transition to the proximal basin plain. The variability is also expressed in the trace fossil content (33 ichnotaxa, 26 ichnogenera). The fine-grained background sediments are totally bioturbated and they show an ichnofabric with Trichichnus, Chondrites, Planolites and small Thalassinoides. Generally, abundance and diversity of trace fossils increase with frequency of sandstone intercalations, probably because of higher and more variable food content and higher preservational potential. Turbiditic sandstones of the proximal basin plain contain abundant graphoglyptids (Paleodictyon, Helminthorhaphe, Urohelminthoida, Desmograpton, Belorhaphe, Helicolithus). Continuous reworking of background sediments points to a good or moderate oxygenation of pore waters. The trace fossil assemblage of fine-grained pelagic sediments with isolated sandstone beds can be ascribed to the Zoophycos ichnofacies sensu lato, but some ichnotaxa typical of turbiditic sediments (e. g., Ophiomorpha annulata) can be present in isolated sandstone beds. Series of turbiditic sandstones with abundant graphoglyptids are typical of the Paleodictyon ichnosubfacies of the Nereites ichnofacies. Turbiditic series in the upper slope setting contain much fewer graphoglyptids. The absence of graphoglyptids in isolated sandstone beds shows that their occurrence {{is not only a}} matter of taphonomy (scouring and casting) but also is related to the presence of more frequent turbidites modifying the substrate...|$|R
40|$|The Sava Depression lies at {{the very}} {{south-western}} margin of the Pannonian Basin. There are 20 hydrocarbon fields altogether and 17 are still in production. The organic geochemistry data and their statistical analysis from the 25 exploration wells, indicate source rock formations in two stratigraphic levels, an older one of Middle Miocene age (Badenian and Sarmatian) and a younger one of Upper Miocene age (Lower Pannonian). Both source rock formations are composed of <b>marls,</b> calcitic <b>marls,</b> <b>clayey</b> limestones and shales. Source rock intervals lay at depths from 1200 to 3362 m. The Total Organic Carbon (TOC) of analyzed samples varies from 0. 39 to 4. 94 %, while their total generative hydrocarbon potential is from 2. 40 to 37. 40 mg HC/g rock. The mean thickness of the intervals is 100 – 150 m. There is a regular linear increase of the maturity level with depth. Source rocks are mature, in the catagenetic phase of transformation that enables hydrocarbon generation. A favourable organic facies, mostly kerogen type II, (organic facies AB and B), with good hydrocarbon potential, dominates the north-western and {{central part of the}} depression. It can be connected with the deeper parts of the depression and/or protected, anoxic to dysoxic stagnant environments with a gradual transition from marine (Badenian/Sarmatian) to brackish depositional environments (Lower Pannonian). In the south-eastern part of the depression, the dominant kerogen type is II–III, (organic facies BC), which indicates a stronger influx of terrestrial material from the uplifted parts that are generally closer to the margins of the depositional basin. The Fisher test (F-test) of the variance similarity (homogeneity), clearly indicates that the Badenian/Sarmatian samples belong to a statistically different population from the Lower Pannonian ones, due to their different depositional environments. </p...|$|R
40|$|WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF FEASABILITY STUDIES OF UNDERGROUND REPOSITORIES FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE, THE STUDY OF PERMEABILITY EVOLUTION WITH DAMAGE OF THE HOST LAYER IS CRUCIAL. THE GOALS OF THIS WORK WERE : (i) TO CHARACTERIZE EXPERIMENTALLY THE DAMAGE OF TWO <b>CLAYEY</b> ROCKS (BEAUCAIRE <b>MARL</b> AND EAST SHALE) WITH X-RAY MICRO TOMOGRAPHY, (ii) TO DEVELOPP A HIGH PRESSURE TRIAXIAL SET-UP ADAPTED TO PERMEABILITY MEASUREMENT ON VERY LOW PERMEABILITY ROCKS. A NUMBER OF ORIGINAL TRIAXIAL DEVICES HAVE BEEN REALISED TO CHARACTERIZE DAMAGE OF CLAYEY ROCKS, UNDER DEVIATORIC LOADING, WITH X-RAY MICRO TOMOGRAPHY ON A SYNCHROTRON BEAMLINE AT THE ESRF (GRENOBLE). LOCALIZED DAMAGE AND ITS EVOLUTION HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED AT A FINE SCALE (OF ORDER OF TEN MICRONS). DIGITAL IMAGE CORRELATION TECHNIQUES, EXTENDED TO 3 D IMAGES, HAVE BEEN USED TO MEASURE INCREMENTAL STRAIN FIELDS FROM TOMOGRAPHIC IMAGES. WE DEMONSTRATED THAT THESE TECHNIQUES ARE VERY USEFUL IN THE STUDY OF THE LOCALIZED DAMAGE OF GEOMATERIALS AND ESPECIALLY FOR THE INITIATION. A HIGH PRESSURE TRIAXIAL DEVICE HAS BEEN REALISED TO MEASURE PERMEABILITY EVOLUTION OF THE EAST SHALE AS A FUNCTION OF APLLIED STRESS (ISOTROPIC AND DEVIATORIC). THE PARTICULARITY OF THIS SET-UP IS THE SMALL SIZE OF THE TEST SPECIMEN (CYLINDER OF 10 MM IN DIAMETER AND 20 MM IN HEIGHT) WHICH ALLOWS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF TEST DURATION.
