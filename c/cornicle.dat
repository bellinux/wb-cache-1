50|$|The {{wingless}} female is {{pale green}} or whitish green with {{two rows of}} dark bands on the thorax and abdomen which unite into a single band near {{the tip of the}} abdomen. The antennae are dark, the legs are pale with dark joints and the <b>cornicles</b> are pale with dark tips. The body is faintly dusted with a white powder. It is between 1.4 and 2.4 mm in length. The winged female is a similar size and has a black head and thorax and a pale green abdomen with black bands near the tip and black patches on the sides. The antennae and legs are dark, and the <b>cornicles</b> are black at the base and yellowish towards the tips. Wingless males have occasionally been seen; these are smaller than the females and olive-green to brownish in colour.|$|R
2500|$|Aphids {{probably}} appeared around , in {{the early}} Permian period. They probably fed on plants like Cordaitales or Cycadophyta. The oldest known aphid fossil is of the species Triassoaphis cubitus from the Triassic.

40|$|Background Altruistic anti-predatory {{behaviours}} pose {{an evolutionary}} problem {{because they are}} costly to the actor and beneficial to the recipients. Altruistic behaviours can evolve through indirect fitness benefits when directed toward kin. The altruistic nature of anti-predatory behaviours {{is often difficult to}} establish because the actor can obtain direct fitness benefits, or the behaviour could result from selfish coercion by others, especially in eusocial animals. Non-eusocial parthenogenetically reproducing aphids form colonies of clone-mates, which are ideal to test the altruistic nature of anti-predatory defence behaviours. Many aphids release <b>cornicle</b> secretions when attacked by natural enemies such as parasitoids. These secretions contain an alarm pheromone that alerts neighbours (clone-mates) of danger, thereby providing indirect fitness benefits to the actor. However, contact with <b>cornicle</b> secretions also hampers an attacker and could provide direct fitness to the actor. Results We tested the hypothesis that <b>cornicle</b> secretions are altruistic by assessing direct and indirect fitness consequences of smearing <b>cornicle</b> secretions onto an attacker, and by manipulating the number of clone-mates that could benefit from the behaviour. We observed parasitoids, Aphidius rhopalosiphi, foraging singly in patches of the cereal aphid Sitobion avenae of varied patch size (2, 6, and 12 aphids). Aphids that smeared parasitoids did not benefit from a reduced probability of parasitism, or increase the parasitoids' handling time. Smeared parasitoids, however, spent proportionately more time grooming and less time foraging, which resulted in a decreased host-encounter and oviposition rate within the host patch. In addition, individual smearing rate increased with the number of clone-mates in the colony. Conclusions <b>Cornicle</b> secretions of aphids were altruistic against parasitoids, as they provided no direct fitness benefits to secretion-releasing individuals, only indirect fitness benefits through neighbouring clone-mates. Moreover, the use of <b>cornicle</b> secretions was consistent with their altruistic nature, because the occurrence of this behaviour increased with the size of indirect fitness benefits, the number of clone-mates that can benefit. This study provides evidence for a case of kin-directed altruistic defence outside eusocial animals...|$|E

40|$|The {{oviposition}} behaviour of the aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi Haliday {{is influenced}} by both chemical and physical cues. Oviposition attack responses were elicited by oaint pigments sealed into {{the tip of a}} glass capillary tube. Parasitoids reacted to yellow pigments with repeated oviposition attack responses, but they did not react to green pigments. The spectrum of reflected light from the yellow pigments was very similar to that from the “green” natural host Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), with a high proportion of the total radiation energy being emitted in the yellow-orange wavebands (580 - 660 nm). Pea aphid <b>cornicle</b> secretion also elicited oviposition attack responses, which were not exclusively induced by its pale yellow-green colour. In fact, the oviposition attack response to capillary tips coated with <b>cornicle</b> secretion remained evident under red light conditions, which, in contrast, nearly completely suppressed the response to yellow pigments. Chemical compounds from <b>cornicle</b> secretion {{do not appear to be}} involved in parasitoid orientation, even though they stimulate intense oviposition attack responses. Olfactometer experiments showed that the putative kairomone involved acts only at very short range or on contact. Host exuviae, which also elicited strong and persistent oviposition reactions from A. ervi females, appear to be a good alternative source of ovipositional kairomone(s). This work confirms the existence of an aphid cuticular kairomone...|$|E
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{pattern and}} morphological {{characters of the}} light-yellow flowered dandelion were investigated in the hilly areas of the west Ise Plain, Mie Prefecture.

It was evidently distin-guished from Taraxacum albidum by length of <b>cornicle</b> on outer involucral bract, angle of open capitulum, length of ligulate corolla on outer-most flower and length ratio of stamens to ligu-late corolla of outermost flower. Compared with T. hideoi in Chita Peninsula that was examined by Serizawa（ 1986 ）, we could not discern any significant differences in length ratio of outer in-volucre to inner involucre, in length of <b>cornicle</b> on outer involucral bract, in the ratio of width to length of outer involucral bract and finally in flower color.

50|$|Aphis craccivora {{is a small}} {{species of}} aphid. The female has a glossy black or dark brown body with a {{prominent}} cauda (tail-like protrusion), and legs in some shade of brown or yellow. The antennae have six segments and these and the limb segments, cauda and <b>cornicles</b> are pale proximally (close to the body) and dark distally (further from the body). The adults do not have wax on their dorsal surface but the nymphs are lightly dusted with wax. Winged females are up to 2.2 mm long and have cross-barring on the abdomen. Wingless females are a little smaller.|$|R
40|$|Insect galls are {{vulnerable}} to invasion by moth larvae that can tunnel into the wall. We report that nymphs of the aphid Nipponaphis monzeni repair their gall self-sacrificingly. When a hole was bored into their gall, many globular nymphs discharged {{a large amount of}} body fluid from their <b>cornicles</b> onto the gall's wound, and kneaded the fluid, which soon became viscous and eventually congealed, plastering over the hole. Having discharged the fluid, the nymphs shrivelled to approximately one-third of their original volume. Several nymphs were buried in the plaster, like 'aphid sacrifices'. This is the most elaborate social behaviour so far known among aphids...|$|R

Large metal <b>cornicles</b> running along {{the base of the}} ceiling hide the illumination lamps. The walls are faced with bright marble and the floor with gray granite. The eastern hall is nicknamed Garmoshka (Garmon), because of its pylons (faced with yellowish marble) which look like a stretched accordion parallel to the length of the hall. The walls are faced with a greyish marble and the floor with bright granite. Heritage of the station's original name, Ploshchad Nogina, can still be found midway in the transfer passage, where a bust of Viktor Nogin (sculptor Shlykov) still stands.|$|R
40|$|The <b>cornicle</b> {{secretion}} of Myzus persicae reared on artificial diet only elicits {{an alarm}} response in plant-reared conspecifics after the young aphids {{have been transferred}} to plants for 7 days. Acetate {{in the form of}} 0. 32 % sodium acetate has been added to the diet as an early step in synthesis of the alarm pheromone, (E) -β-farnesene (EBF). The <b>cornicle</b> secretion of diet-reared aphids then elicits an alarm response. However, there is no difference in internal EBF concentration between plant- and diet-reared aphids. Puncturing aphids, either plant- or diet-reared, with a pin shows that both can elicit an alarm response, whereas it is reduced by half with diet-reared individuals. Although there is {{no significant difference in the}} concentration of EBF produced, the total amount in diet-reared aphids is increased by acetate in the diet to a level similar to that in plant-reared individuals: the size of aphids reared on an acetate-supplemented diet is increased and comparable with the size of those that are plant-reared. Bioassays with a range of EBF concentrations show a high threshold for the alarm response. It is concluded that the different size of aphids reared on plants and standard diet results in them secreting, respectively, above and below the response threshold...|$|E

40|$|The role {{of color}} and shape in the host {{recognition}} and acceptance behavior of Aphidius ervi Haliday was studied. A quantitative analysis of the oviposition behavior of A. ervi was carried out with a computer-aided analysis of 150 video-recorded oviposition sequences on its natural host, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris). The importance of visual stimuli was assessed in a choice condition bioassay, observing the behavioral reaction of female parasitoids to various test materials flame-sealed into glass capillaries. Glass beads 2 and 6 mm in diameter and a flat arena were coated with <b>cornicle</b> secretion of A. pisum, and their acceptance rates by both naive and experienced female parasitoids were assessed under no-choice conditions. In most cases, A. ervi females switched from random searching to attack position when the host was within a range of I cm, suggesting that host recognition is regulated in part by cues acting before physical contact. The glass capillary bioassay indicated that visual cues are important factors in the host recognition and acceptance phases. Pea aphid color alone can elicit the oviposition response of naive A. ervi females, and this response is enhanced when color is combined with aphid shape. The <b>cornicle</b> secretion of A. pisum stimulated an oviposition response which was stronger in naive females of A. ervi than in experienced ones and was not significantly affected by the glass bead size or flat surface. These results, along with those from previous studies, suggest that manipulation of the oviposition behavior of A. ervi is feasible under laboratory conditions...|$|E
50|$|The {{viviparous}} wingless {{females have}} an oval or pear-shaped body and grow to {{a length of}} up to 2 mm. Early in the season they are brownish but later they are yellowish-green. The antennae are pale green and short, about half {{the length of the}} body. There is no dark, shining patch on the dorsal surface of the abdomen, a fact which distinguishes it from the otherwise similar thistle aphid (Brachycaudus cardui). The cauda (tail-like elongation) is bluntly rounded, the legs are pale except for the extremities, and the <b>cornicles</b> are pale-coloured, short and flanged. Winged females range from 1.3 to 1.8 mm in length and have a blackish head with longer antennae, blackish thorax and a green abdomen with dark spots on the third to sixth segments. The overwintering eggs are black.|$|R
2500|$|Aphids {{are in the}} {{superfamily}} Aphidoidea in the Sternorrhyncha {{division of}} the order Hemiptera. Late 20th-century reclassification within the Hemiptera reduced the old taxon [...] "Homoptera" [...] to two suborders: Sternorrhyncha (e.g., aphids, whiteflies, scales, psyllids, etc.) and Auchenorrhyncha (e.g., cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, etc.) with the suborder Heteroptera containing {{a large group of}} insects known as the true bugs. Early 21st-century reclassifications substantially rearranged the families within Aphidoidea: some old families were reduced to subfamily rank (e.g., Eriosomatidae), and many old subfamilies were elevated to family rank. The most recent authoritative classifications place all extant taxa into a single large family Aphididae. Despite their names, taxonomically, the woolly conifer aphids like the pine aphid, the spruce aphid, and the balsam woolly aphid are not true aphids, but adelgids, and lack the <b>cornicles</b> of true aphids.|$|R
50|$|The adult psyllid {{is about}} four millimetres long with a fawn and brown mottled {{body and a}} light brown head. It {{is covered with a}} whitish, waxy {{secretion}} which makes it look dusty. The forewings are broadest at the back and have a dark edging around the periphery with a pale gap near the apex. The antennae are pale brown with black tips. These features distinguish it from the superficially similar African citrus psyllid. It typically adopts a head down, tail up posture as it sucks sap. Aphids are often also present on citrus and psyllids can be distinguished from them by being more active, jumping insects, whereas aphids are sedentary. In addition, the antennae of a psyllid has ten segments whereas those of aphids usually have four or six segments. Most aphids have <b>cornicles</b> on the abdomen and psyllids lack these.|$|R
