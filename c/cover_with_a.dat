5|$|A {{decompression}} trapeze is {{a device}} used in recreational diving and technical diving to make decompression stops {{more comfortable and}} more secure and provide the divers' surface <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> visual reference for the divers' position. It consists of a horizontal bar or bars suspended at the depth of intended decompression stops by buoys. The bars are of sufficient weight and the buoys of sufficient buoyancy that the trapeze will not easily change depth in turbulent water or if the divers experience buoyancy control problems.|$|E
5|$|When Kubo {{was asked}} to make a <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> female {{character}} during Christmas, Kubo initially thought of using Rukia; he later changed to use Orihime Inoue as he thought Orihime was more suitable for such role. However, Kubo commented he previously made a Christmas illustration with Rukia, and that he received request by several fans wanting to see the image. In contrast to this, Kubo has found he liked Rukia more in the illustrations in which her face expresses pain such as when {{she is going to}} be executed in the manga.|$|E

5|$|Among Harrison's post-Beatles solo releases, Extra Texture is {{the only}} album on which his lyrics are devoid of any obvious spiritual message. Uniquely also, it was {{recorded}} mostly in America rather than England, while Harrison was working in Los Angeles {{in his role as}} head of Dark Horse Records. Gary Wright, David Foster, Jim Keltner, Jesse Ed Davis, Leon Russell, Tom Scott, Billy Preston and Jim Horn were among the many contributing musicians. The keyboard-heavy arrangements incorporate elements of soul music and the influence of Smokey Robinson, signalling a further departure from the rock and folk-rock sound of Harrison's popular early-1970s work. Contrasting with the musical content, the album's art design conveys an upbeat mood and includes an unusual die-cut <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> textured surface.|$|E
5|$|On October 17, 2010, Kanye West {{revealed}} through Twitter that My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy {{had been}} rejected by certain stores because of the cover art. The artwork (a portrait by George Condo) shows West being straddled by an armless winged female (a phoenix). Both characters are depicted nude, and one nipple of the phoenix's breasts and her buttocks are visible. The artist later said that Kanye wanted a cover image that would be banned. The painting is centered with a thin yellow border on a red background. The artwork follows along the apparent theme of the album, as well as West's music film Runaway. This {{is one of five}} covers; all of them were included with its purchase. A second <b>cover,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> painting of a ballerina by Condo, was posted on the Amazon.com pre-order page. It was intended to be the original artwork for Runaway, but West used a photograph of a ballerina instead.|$|E
5|$|Three {{publishers}} praised The Well {{but turned}} it down. Hall's agent then sent the manuscript to Jonathan Cape who, though cautious about publishing a controversial book, saw {{the potential for}} a commercial success. Cape tested the waters with a small print run of 1500 copies, priced at 15 shillings– about twice the cost of an average novel– to make it less attractive to sensation-seekers. Publication, originally scheduled for late 1928, was brought forward when he discovered that another novel with a lesbian theme, Compton Mackenzie's Extraordinary Women, was to be published in September. Though the two books proved to have little in common, Hall and Cape saw Extraordinary Women as a competitor and wanted to beat it to market. The Well appeared on 27 July, in a black <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> plain jacket. Cape sent review copies only to newspapers and magazines he thought would handle the subject matter non-sensationally.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is rectangular, 10 x 20 m, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> interior divided into two. The southern part contains a mihrab and is <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> barrel vault.

5|$|To {{remedy the}} causes of the fire, changes were made in the Block II {{spacecraft}} and operational procedures, the most important of which were use of a nitrogen/oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch, and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials. The Block II design already called for replacement of the Block I plug-type hatch <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> quick-release, outward opening door. NASA discontinued the manned Block I program, using the Block I spacecraft only for unmanned Saturn V flights. Crew members would also exclusively wear modified, fire-resistant A7L Block II space suits, and would be designated by the Block II titles, regardless of whether a LM was present on the flight or not.|$|E
5|$|Former Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara was {{appointed}} as Wilcox's successor, with Simon Donnelly joining as his assistant. McNamara's first match in charge was a 3–2 away {{defeat in the}} FA Cup first round to Accrington Stanley, who took the lead on 29 minutes through Sean McConville, before Oliver equalised for York five minutes later with a close-range finish. Matt Crooks put Accrington back in front two minutes later and Josh Windass scored a penalty early into the second half, before Coulson scored a consolation goal for York with a stoppage time header. York were eliminated from the Football League Trophy after being beaten 2–1 away by Barnsley in the Northern section quarter-final. Coulson opened the scoring for York on 40 minutes with a free kick into the top-left corner, before the League One team scored {{in the second half}} through Ben Pearson and Adam Hammill. Greening, who began his career at the club, registered as a player on non-contract terms aged 36, to provide <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> number of midfielders unavailable. York were beaten 2–1 at home by league leaders Plymouth Argyle, who were two goals up by half-time with goals from Jake Jervis and Graham Carey. Dave Winfield was stretchered off with his neck in a brace during the second half, and Ben Godfrey scored a consolation goal for York during the 10 minutes of stoppage time that followed. Defender Will Boyle, the Huddersfield Town under-21 captain, was signed on a youth loan until January 2016.|$|E

In the expeditionary period post Civil War, Marines began wearing a khaki field uniform, better suited to tropical and arid environments. In the 1890s, the Marines adopted some practical changes to the field uniform, adding a campaign <b>cover,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large Marine emblem on the side, and canvas leggings.|$|E

He was named as utility player in the 1957 All Australian baseball team, and his ability was such that he was approached by Major League Baseball scouts. Before the retirement of Neil Harvey, he and O'Neill fielded in tandem in the covers and the pair were regarded as the finest fielding combination of the time.|$|E
500|$|The first U.S. {{issue of}} the album was on the Dunhill Records {{division}} of ABC Records. It featured a revised <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> white background instead of purple.

500|$|Another {{attempt to}} deliver the Albacores and more Spitfires was made during Operation LB. As usual, Argus {{provided}} the air <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dozen Fulmars from 807 Squadron and Eagle ferried the Albacores and 17 Spitfires to their take-off point for Malta on 19 May. The Spitfires were flown off successfully, but the engines of the Albacores all began to overheat and {{they were forced to}} return to the carrier. Examination of the aircraft revealed that their air coolers had been set to [...] "Winter" [...] rather than [...] "Summer". One of the Fulmars was shot down by Vichy French Dewoitine D.520 fighters as it attempted to protect the crew of a Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat that had been shot down earlier. By this time the ship's Vickers [...]50-calibre machine guns had been replaced by 13 Oerlikon 20mm light anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
500|$|In the {{intervening}} time, a few skirmishes {{took place between}} RAF fighters and German reconnaissance aircraft. A Lehrgeschwader 2 (LG 2) Bf 110 was shot down in the morning.
