5000|$|In November 2011, an {{agriculture}} {{appropriations bill}} passed by Congress garnered controversy for blocking a proposed change by the Obama administration to school lunch regulations, whereby 1/8 cup of tomato paste {{would no longer}} have been considered as having the nutritional equivalent of 1/2 a <b>cup</b> of <b>vegetables,</b> but instead only as having the nutritional equivalent of 1/8 <b>cup</b> of <b>vegetables</b> (i.e., schools can only credit a volume of vegetables as equivalent to its actual size). Critics of this move by Congress claim that pressure was placed upon officials voting on the bill by lobbyists representing pizza manufacturers and cheese producers, as it was seen to threaten the ability of schools to serve pizza and credit it with the same level of nutritional value as they heretofore had. Many critics have sardonically summarized the situation as [...] "Pizza is now a vegetable" [...] or [...] "Congress decides pizza is a vegetable". However, others have pointed out that 1/8 cup of tomato paste stacks up remarkably well against a 1/2 <b>cup</b> of <b>vegetables</b> nutritionally, albeit with an excessive amount of sodium that could be argued to reduce its nutritional value.|$|R

40|$|Information is sparse on {{the role}} of foods in {{long-term}} blood pressure (BP) change. The investigators examined relations of food intake to BP change in a prospective cohort study of 1, 710 employed men in Chicago, Illinois, initially aged 41 – 57 years. In 1958 and 1959, BP was measured and nutrient intake assessed by comprehensive interview. In 1959, intake of 26 specific food groups was also assessed. BP was remeasured annually through 1966. The generalized estimating equation method was used to analyze relations of food group intakes to average annual BP change, adjusting for age, weight at each year, alcohol consumption, calories, and other foods. Average systolic blood pressure (SBP) /diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increase was 1. 9 / 0. 3 mmHg per year. The SBP of men who consumed 14 – 42 <b>cups</b> of <b>vegetables</b> a month (0. 5 – 1. 5 cups/day) versus < 14 cups a month (< 0. 5 cups/day) was estimated to rise 2. 8 mmHg less in 7 years (p < 0. 01). The SBP of men who consumed 14 – 42 cups of fruit a month versus < 14 cups a month was estimated to increase 2. 2 mmHg less in 7 years (p < 0. 05). Beef-veal-lamb and poultry intakes were related directly to a greater SBP/DBP increase (p < 0. 05). These results support the concept that diets higher in fruits and vegetables and lower in meats (except fish) may reduce the risk of developing high BP. blood pressure; diet; follow-up; fruit; nutrition; population studies; vegetables Abbreviations: DASH, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; SBP, systolic blood pressure...|$|R
40|$|The current {{national}} guidelines {{recommend that}} adult women, ages 19 - 30, consume at least 2 cups {{of fruit and}} 2. 5 <b>cups</b> of <b>vegetables</b> daily (U. S. Department of Agriculture, 2015). However, few women who are Black and emerging adults (ages 18 - 30) meet these recommendations. This sequential exploratory mixed methods study, guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1985), sought to understand the factors influencing Black emerging adult women’s (BEAW’S) intention to consume the recommended daily intake {{of fruits and vegetables}} (FVs). Beliefs about FV consumption were elicited via focus groups from a purposive sample of 27 BEAW (2 groups with 10 women per group, and 1 group with 7 women). Directed content analysis of the qualitative data revealed that key behavioral beliefs associated with meeting the recommended daily intake of FVs were increased perceived energy, weight loss, and nutrient intake. Family (i. e. parents, spouse/significant other, siblings), healthcare providers (i. e. doctor, nutritionist) and friends were associated with normative beliefs. Key control beliefs were time, cost, and access. Intention to meet the recommended daily intake of FVs was assessed through a cross-sectional researcher-developed survey administered to 100 BEAW. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that attitudes and self-efficacy were the strongest predictors of intention to meet the recommended daily intake of FVs. Furthermore, the availability of a supermarket in walking distance was the control belief driving self-efficacy. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at increasing FV consumption in BEAW should prioritize modifying attitudes, self-efficacy, and the food environment. The outcomes of this study provide preliminary evidence of factors important for developing interventions to increase FV consumption among BEAW. ...|$|R

40|$|Six of {{the short}} dietary {{questions}} used in the 1995 National Nutrition Survey (see box below) were evaluated for relative validity both directly and indirectly and for consistency, by documenting the differences in mean intakes of foods and nutrients as measured on the 24 -hour recall, between groups with different responses to the short questions. 1. Including snacks, {{how many times do}} you usually have something to eat in a day including evenings? 2. How many days per week do you usually have something to eat for breakfast? 3. In the last 12 months, were there any times that you ran out of food and couldn’t afford to buy more? 4. What type of milk do you usually consume? 5. How many serves of vegetables do you usually eat each day? (a serve = 1 / 2 <b>cup</b> cooked <b>vegetables</b> or 1 <b>cup</b> of salad <b>vegetables)</b> 6. How many serves of fruit do you usually eat each day? (a serve = 1 medium piece or 2 small pieces of fruit or 1 cup of diced pieces) These comparisons were made for males and females overall and for population sub-groups of interest including: age, socio-economic disadvantage, region of residence, country of birth, and BMI category. Several limitations to this evaluation {{of the short}} questions, as discussed in the report, need to be kept in mind including: · The method for comparison available (24 -hour recall) was not ideal (gold standard); as it measures yesterday’s intake. This limitation was overcome by examining only mean differences between groups of respondents, since mean intake for a group can provide a reasonable approximation for ‘usual’ intake. · The need to define and identify, post-hoc, from the 24 -hour recall the number of eating occasions, and occasions identified by the respondents as breakfast. · Predetermined response categories for some of the questions effectively limited the number of categories available for evaluation. · Other foods and nutrients, not selected for this evaluation, may have an indirect relationship with the question, and might have shown stronger and more consistent responses. · The number of responses in some categories of the short questions eg for food security may have been too small to detect significant differences between population sub-groups. · No information was available to examine the validity of these questions for detecting differences over time (establishing trends) in food habits and indicators of selected nutrient intakes. By contrast, the strength of this evaluation was its very large sample size, (atypical of most validation studies of dietary assessment) and thus, the opportunity to investigate question performance in a range of broad population sub-groups compared with a well-conducted, quantified survey of intakes.

40|$|Background: Although family {{child care}} homes (FCCH) are {{the second most}} {{utilized}} form of non-relative child care in the US, {{little is known about}} what children eat in this setting. ^ Objectives: The primary objective is to assess the quality of meals and snacks consumed by children aged 2 - 5 in FCCH compared to the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA 2015). The secondary, exploratory objective is to explore the association between childcare provider acculturation and dietary consumption of children in FCCH. ^ Design: This cross-sectional study used baseline data from an ongoing cluster randomized controlled intervention trial in FCCH. ^ Participants/setting: Family childcare providers completed a demographic survey. Preschool-aged children (n = 124; 2 - 5 years old) enrolled in 43 FCCH, were observed during two meals and a snack each day for two days, following a standardized protocol. ^ Main outcome measures: Foods and beverages consumed were analyzed in the Nutrition Data System for Research 2015. Mean amounts consumed of each food group were compared to 2 / 3 of the daily intake recommendations established by the DGA 2015 for children 1 - 3 years old (1000 kcal) given that recommendations are not standard across age groups. For the exploratory analysis, acculturation was measured using a proxy measure of language spoken at home. ^ Statistical analyses: One-sample t-tests and one-sample sign tests tested for differences between mean food group amounts consumed compared to the national guidelines.

40|$|Abstract Background Recommendations {{for daily}} dietary {{vegetable}} intake were {{increased in the}} 2005 USDA Dietary Guidelines as consumption of a diet rich in vegetables {{has been associated with}} lower risk of certain chronic health disorders including cardiovascular disease. However, vegetable consumption in the United States has declined over the past decade; consequently, the gap between dietary recommendations and vegetable intake is widening. The primary aim {{of this study is to}} determine if drinking vegetable juice is a practical way to help meet daily dietary recommendations for vegetable intake consistent with the 2005 Dietary Guidelines and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. The secondary aim is to assess the effect of a vegetable juice on measures of cardiovascular health. Methods We conducted a 12 -week, randomized, controlled, parallel-arm study consisting of 3 groups of free-living, healthy volunteers who participated in study visits at the Ragle Human Nutrition Research Center at the University of California, Davis. All subjects received education on the DASH diet and 0, 8 or 16 fluid ounces of vegetable juice daily. Assessments were completed of daily vegetable servings before and after incorporation of vegetable juice and cardiovascular health parameters including blood pressure. Results Without the juice, vegetable intake in all groups was lower than the 2005 Dietary Guidelines and DASH diet recommendations. The consumption of the vegetable juice helped participants reach recommended intake. In general, parameters associated with cardiovascular health did not change over time. However, in the vegetable juice intervention groups, subjects who were pre-hypertensive at the start of the study showed a significant decrease in blood pressure during the 12 -week intervention period. Conclusion Including 1 - 2 <b>cups</b> of <b>vegetable</b> juice daily was an effective and acceptable way for healthy adults to close the dietary vegetable gap.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{vegetables}} {{is expected to}} increase with trends in the population of the United States. For example, having a college education increases demand, and more Amer-icans are completing college. However, the possibility of a cohort effect has not been con-sidered. A cohort includes people born in the same year, and is similar in concept to a generation. Using data collected over more than twenty years, we find younger cohorts spend less money on fresh vegetables for at-home consumption than their older coun-terparts do. These effects will decrease demand over time. Changing cooking habits may explain this effect. Health-oriented government agencies, including the U. S. Department of Agri-culture (USDA) and the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), are encouraging Americans to eat a sufficient quantity and variety of vegetables. These two agencies publish their recommendations in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans as well as in MyPyramid. Moreover, both the USDA and DHHS have joined with social marketers outside government to promote vegetable consumption through the National 5 A Day Partnership. In 2001, the USDA and Center for Disease Control (CDC) joined the Produce for Bet-ter Health Foundation (PBH) in its “ 5 A Day ” social marketing campaign. Pre-viously, this campaign had been cosponsored by the PBH and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). (CDC and NCI are part of DHHS). The expanded Na-tional 5 A Day Partnership is now the largest private/public nutrition education effort. While progress has been made, consumption remains well below the recom-mended 2. 5 <b>cups</b> of <b>vegetables</b> daily (USDA). Since the launch of 5 A Day in 1991 and the Food Guide Pyramid in 1992, predecessor to MyPyramid, Americans have increased their consumption from about 1. 6 to about 1. 8 cups daily.

This research is a secondary data analysis of YEAH, a randomized controlled trial. YEAH was a 10 -week web-based, stage-tailored intervention focused on nutrition, physical activity, and stress management to prevent excessive weight gain in college students. ^ Setting. College students participated in this web-based intervention with web-based assessments. ^ Participants. Students were from 14 universities, aged 18 – 24 years, body mass index 3 ̆e 18. 5 kg/m². Participants were randomized into intervention and control groups. Intervention group (n= 822) data were analyzed for this study. ^ Main outcome measures. A post evaluation process survey was completed, and ranked how motivating they found different program elements to improve their health. Participants also completed online questionnaires assessing fruit and vegetable consumption, kilocalories from sugar-sweetened beverages, metabolic equivalent minutes per week, perceived stress, and emotional eating. Computer monitoring tracked actual online activity access and viewing. ^ Analysis. Differences in outcomes from baseline to post were assessed by t-test and χ 2.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 University of Washington Abstract Restaurant Response to the San Francisco Toy Ordinance: Changes in Toy Marketing and Children's Menu Options Sara Diedrich Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Assistant Professor Jennifer Otten Nutritional Sciences Program Background: On December 1, 2011, San Francisco, CA {{became the}} first US city to pass the Healthy Food Incentives Ordinance, which prohibits fast food {{restaurants}} from giving away free toys or other incentives {{in combination with the}} purchase of a children's meal unless it meets minimal nutrition criteria. Restaurants were given a year to comply with this ordinance and could respond by improving the healthfulness of it's children's menu items or by changing it's toy marketing or distribution practices. Purpose: Compare changes in children's menu items, food environments and toy/marketing practices at ordinance-affected restaurants in San Francisco before and after ordinance enactment. Methods: All possible children's menu combinations at 30 ordinance-affected fast food restaurants (representing 8 national/global chains) were evaluated at 4 time points: 3 pre-ordinance enactment and 1 post-ordinance enactment using corporate nutrition information. The restaurants' food environment and toy marketing practices were assessed using the Children's Menu Assessment (CMA) tool. Results: While many restaurants added healthier sides or beverages to their children's meals during the study period, nutrition analysis showed that no combinations of children's meals met the ordinance's nutritional criteria at any time point. Eleven of thirty restaurants did not comply with the ordinance. The remaining 19 restaurants complied by offering the toy for ten cents (n= 7), eliminating the children's meal (n= 6), or eliminating toy giveaways (n= 6). Overall, CMA scores improved an average of 0. 89 points from time point 1 to time point 4 due to a mix of both improvements and declines in score by chain. Improvements were seen in the areas of nutritional guidance, toy/marketing practices, presence of unhealthy desserts and side dish score while a decline was seen in beverage scores. Percentage of healthy meals, healthy desserts and healthy grains did not change. Conclusions: The ordinance was not effective in inducing restaurants to meet ordinance nutrition criteria. The greatest barrier to compliance with the ordinance's nutrition criteria appeared to be the addition of 0. 75 <b>cups</b> of <b>vegetables</b> to children's meals. Additionally, the wording of the ordinance, specifically the inclusion of the word "free," allowed restaurants to comply by charging ten cents for their toys or eliminating children's meals from their menu. Time and care should be spent on the wording of future ordinances to ensure the words chosen will produce the desired outcomes. However, within the year the ordinance was enacted, many national and global fast food chains made healthful changes to their children's menu or toy/marketing practices. While we cannot say these changes were a direct response to the toy ordinance, it is evident fast food restaurants are capable and willing to make healthful changes...|$|R
40|$|Importance: Childhood and {{adolescent}} overweight and obesity {{have more than}} tripled {{over the past two}} decades. Bariatric surgery is becoming more common for adolescents. Currently, there are few studies that describe outcomes after bariatric surgery in adolescents and no studies that describe nutritional behaviors that predict sustained weight loss in this population post-surgery. Objective: To describe pre-surgery dietary intake in adolescents who underwent a sleeve gastrectomy between 2011 and 2013 at an outpatient pediatric weight loss clinic. This study specifically aims to determine whether there is a correlation between fruit and vegetable intake before surgery and weight loss post-surgery in adolescents. Design, Setting, and Participants: The participants in this study received the sleeve gastrectomy procedure. Patients were between the ages of 13 - 17 years old and had a BMI between 35 kg/m 2 to 60 kg/m 2. All patients had undergone extensive counseling and assessment by a team of medical professionals (pediatrician, psychologist, exercise physiologist, nurse, and dietitian) for at least six months before surgery. Weekly number of servings of fruits and <b>vegetables,</b> <b>cups</b> of sweetened beverages (separated as fruit juice or soda), servings of fried foods eaten, and meals eaten from or at restaurants as reported at the initial consultation were collected and analyzed. Results: The mean age of participants (n= 11) was 17. 1 ± 1. 51 years. Mean servings of vegetables consumed at baseline was 7. 32 ± 4. 38 servings per week and mean weekly consumption of fruits was 6. 0 ± 4. 16 servings per week. There were no statistically significant correlations between baseline fruit (p = 0. 50) and vegetable (p = 0. 44) consumption with weight (kg) lost six months after surgery. Conclusion: While the relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption with weight lost six months post-surgery failed to reach significance, there was a trend such that patients who consumed more servings of fruits and vegetables at baseline had lost more weight at 6 months. It {{is interesting to note that}} none of the patients in the study consumed the recommended daily servings of fruits or vegetables at baseline in accordance with the USDA guidelines. A longer study may reveal a more significant relationship between dietary patterns before surgery and changes in weight after surgery...|$|R
