We also use the acceleration data to characterize the formation. On rotary corers, acceleration amplitudes decrease with increasing hardness of the formation. Comparison with geophysical logs shows that this relationship can resolve cm-scale features. On piston corers, the maximum ac-celeration is characteristic of the sediment shear strength.

The hole drilled was not a perfect cylinder, but was generally funnel-shaped with sides sloping inward at about 0. 004 °. Lateral oscillations of the bit dur-ing drilling produced an enlarged hole whose diameter exceeded that of the bit by a couple of inches (ca. 5 cm). By and large, the hole diameter was greatest in the softest rock. In places, further enlargement of the hole occurred repeatedly every 9. 5 meters (the length of a core), caused primarily by sea-water erosion during the pumping of fresh <b>core</b> <b>barrels</b> down the pipe. Other portions of the hole were reamed smooth by the top edge of the bottom-hole assembly. Some recovered rocks show helical exterior grooves indicating that the drill bit not only rotated, but also moved in a small cir-cle as the cores were cut...|$|R

5000|$|Diamond {{drilling}} is {{much slower}} than reverse circulation (RC) drilling {{due to the}} hardness of the ground being drilled. Drilling of 1200 to 1800 metres is common and at these depths, ground is mainly hard rock. Techniques vary among drill operators and what the rig they are using is capable of, some diamond rigs need to drill slowly to lengthen the life of drill bits and rods, which are very expensive and time consuming to replace at extremely deep depths. As a diamond drill rig cores deeper and deeper the time consuming {{part of the process}} is not cutting 5 to 10 more feet of rock core but the retrieval of the core with the wire line & overshot tool.Core samples are retrieved via the use of a core tube, a hollow tube placed inside the rod string and pumped with water until it locks into the <b>core</b> <b>barrel.</b> As the core is drilled, the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> slides over the core as it is cut.

Other large areas of State-owned lands form the beds of lakes and navigable rivers. Some evidence, such as the proximity of hot springs, indicates there may be important geothermal potential on these lands. The purpose of this project is to develop methods, tools, and interpretive techniques to explore for and evaluate geothermal resources on submerged lands. Presently, {{the state of the}} art is primitive because there has been little interest or effort in assessing the resource potential of submerged lands, and the limited work carried out thus far has been for scientific purposes. There has been a moderate amount of water temperature measuring for oceanographic or limnologic studies and fairly reliable techniques exist. There have been limited measurements of the temperature, thermal gradient, and heat flow in bottom sediment of the ocean area off California and from the lakes. Probably less than a dozen data points exist for State-owned land.

The core was teken with single tube <b>core</b> <b>barrels</b> and was unoriented. Techniques used to drill and log this core are discussed, as well as techniques to orient the core. Of the 5150 ft (1570 m) of core more than 3645 ft (1111 m) was retained and logged in some detail. As a result of the core logging, geologic discontinuities were identified, joint frequency and spacing characterized. Discontinuities identified included several joint sets, shear zones and faults. Correlations based on coring along were generally found to be impossible, even for the more prominent features. The only feature properly correlated from the exploratory drilling was the fault system at the end of the facility, but it was not identified from the exploratory core as a fault. Identification of discontinuities was later helped by underground mapping that identified several different joint sets with different characteristics. It was found that joint frequency varied from 0. 3 to 1. 1 joint per foot of core for open fractures and from 0. 3 to 3. 3 /ft for closed or healed fractures. Histograms of fracture spacing indicate that there is likely a random distribution of spacing superimposed upon uniformly spaced fractures. It was found that a low angle joint set had a persistent mean orientation. These joints were healed and had pervasive wall rock alteration which made identification of joints in this set possible. The recognition of a joint set with known attitude allowed orientation of much of the core. This orientation technique was found to be effective. 10 references, 25 figures, 4 tables...|$|R

40|$|The HDR {{experimental}} {{facility has}} been used for several blowdown experiments in order to study fluid-structure interactions and loadings on the pressure vessel internal structures of a pressurized water reactor. We have developed the code FLUX to analyse the motions in the initial blowdown period. This paper describes a new type of HDR experiments (V 34) and compares the experimental results with the FLUX-code results. As novel feature, the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> is not rigidly clamped to the vessel as in earlier experiments but supported with gaps such that the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> can move freely upwards for about 2 mm and horizontally for 0. 3 mm at the upper flange. At the lower core-barrel edge, snubbers restrict the horizontal motion to about + 1. 4 mm and − 2. 8 mm. The experimental results show that the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> is deflected sidewards until it hits the snubber at the lower edge and then swings back to hit the opposite snubber. By this some kinetic energy is lost due to plastic snubber deformations. At the same time, the measurements show that the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> lifts rather uniformly from its support upwards until it hits the upper constraint. Several bounces up and down are observed until the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> becomes fixed probably due to friction from the side. This situation has been pre- and post-computed with the new FLUX-version which contains a very effective algorithm to treat supports with gaps and resultant impacts. For treatment of plastic supports, a simple model is added. Pre-computations were not meaningful because of large deviations in the pre-estimated initials gaps. However the computed pressure-field is not influenced very much by these parameters and predicted very well. This was favoured by the isothermal fluid initial conditions. Post-computations show sufficient agreement with respect to computed <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> motion. The axial motion is described very well. Some problems remain which are due to the model for the upper flange support. Impacts do not results in greatly enlarged loadings, strains or accelerations for this situation...|$|E

30|$|The {{riverbed}} drilling {{was carried}} out using boring machine and accessories that floated in the river by using approximately 16 square metres of pontoon. In order to avoid borehole walls from collapsing, steel casting HW size 114.3  mm O.D. and NW 88.9  mm O.D. was used. The boreholes were then washed by circulating water from drilling pump. Afterwards, the necessary soil samples were collected for visual examination and laboratory testing. In addition, the drilling process had been carried out in accordance with good practice as described in ASTM D 2113 - 14 (2014). The drilling focused on obtaining the core samples by penetrating the full depth of the strata. In {{order to get to}} that point, the non-retractable <b>core</b> <b>barrels</b> with 54.0  mm (N size) of core diameter were operated. In comparison, the sediment sampling method utilised a special sand bit of 30  mm diameter and 0.5  m length, connected to steel rods that used for drilling. The bit was driven into soil manually at certain depth through the river water level of 4.5  m. The method is also suitable to be conducted on self-supporting ground without hard obstructions or gravel-sized to boulder-sized particles. Subsequently, the sandy material trapped inside the bit was taken out from the drilled hole and kept in poly bags before sending in for laboratory test. As for this study, the standpipe method has been chosen to determine the riverbed permeability of Muda River Basin as it can be performed directly in river and produces adequate outcomes to measure in situ aquifer. Furthermore, the method is suitable to observe the key parameters involved in evaluating riverbank filtration in this study which are the riverbed permeability, the aquifer transmissivity and the hydrogeological setting. The method was firstly conducted by operating the in situ standpipe test at the location. Two standpipes of uPVC material with 75  mm and 100  mm (D) diameter were carefully inserted into the river streambed to minimise any disturbance on the hyporheic layer. The standpipe of 117  mm depth (Lv) was then vertically inserted into the riverbed. Streambed sediment of 150  mm height (Lv) was expected to fill the bottom part of the pipes. The pipe was in vertical position, while the river water is pour into the standpipes. The changes by which the levels drop to the surface water level (h 1 and h 2) and the time taken (t 1 and t 2) each drop were measured, respectively.|$|R

The investigation is meant to conclude if it is plausible to use these pulsations to determine if the lower radial supports are working properly, securing the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> in place, stopping it from vibrating/moving. The lower supports have a maximum allowed gap between the clevis insert ant the lower radial support, this gap is known to be larger than intended but still below the upper allowed limit. If the gap would grow as large as it is allowed, would it should then be possible to measure this from the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> vibrations made possible from this gap. There are only certain positions where these measurements can be done, is it possible to se pressure pulses at these positions? From an initial heavily simplified model this seems to be the case, forcing vibrations with a certain frequency of the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> gives rise to a small fluctuation of about 0. 009 MPa at the locations of interest. These pulsations show an almost linear relation between the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> displacement and peak to peak pressure amplitude. A more detailed model was used for the final simulation. This model confirms the results from the simplified model, showing a slightly larger pressure pulse in several of the guide tube positions. The peak to peak amplitude is about 0. 002 MPa. The maximum fluctuations are occurring close to the periphery of the reactor pressure vessel, with both of the models. This suggests that it would be beneficial to measure the fluctuations at such a position...|$|E

The termination point of this structural entity corresponds to a well conserved exon boundary in eukaryotic homologs of CspA. The C-terminal segment of 1 B 11 is derived fro the first 34 residues of the E. coli 30 S ribosomal S 1 domain. Both CspA and the S 1 domain are monomeric globular proteins and have a five stranded beta barrel topology. 1 B 11 not only is tetrameric, but also has a different architecture, composed of a six-stranded beta barrel in which two strands are domain swapped. The individual segments taken from the original structures, have, however, retained much the same topology. The overall OB-fold topology is well maintained, with the first three strands of 1 B 11 being superimposable with those of CspA. Two strands from the C-terminal half of 1 B 11 have come to occupy spatially similar positions to {{the fourth and fifth}} strand of CspA. Also, hydrophobic residues in the 1 B 11 <b>barrel</b> <b>core</b> recapitulate <b>barrel</b> packing in the original structure. The sixth strand of 1 B 11 has been accommodated at the periphery of the barrel, such that a number of hydrophobic residues are solvent exposed. Oligomerisation in the form of tetramer formation and domain swapping allows stabilization of the structure by burying those hydrophobic residues. A combination of two non-contiguous subdomain elements has given rise to a folded domain with novel architecture and composition. This is consistent with the creation of domains by exon shuffling early on in evolution. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRiboflavin kinase (RFK) is an {{essential}} enzyme catalyzing the phosphorylation of riboflavin (vitamin B 2) to form FMN, an obligatory step in vitamin B 2 utilization and flavin cofactor synthesis. The structure of human RFK revealed a six-stranded antiparallel β <b>barrel</b> <b>core</b> structurally similar to the riboflavin synthase/ferredoxin reductase FAD binding domain fold. The binding site of an intrinsically bound MgADP defines a novel nucleotide binding motif that encompasses a loop, a 310 helix, and a reverse turn followed by a short β strand. This active site loop forms an arch with ATP and riboflavin binding at the opposite side and the phosphoryl transfer appears to occur through the hole underneath the arch. The invariant residues Asn 36 and Glu 86 are implicated in the catalysis...|$|R
50|$|Merely {{advancing}} the drill by rotary action (and washing) causes a core to be extracted inside the barrel as shown. However, {{at a depth}} of perhaps 300 m, there must be a way to retrieve the core and take it to the surface. Constantly withdrawing the entire heavy drill pipe is impractical, so methods were developed to pull up the <b>core</b> inside the <b>barrel.</b> If the rock would always be solid granite, and the core would always break at the drill bit, then it would be a simple matter to stop the drilling, and lower a simple grabbing device by a wire and pull up the core. Unfortunately, many applications require an undisturbed core in fractured rock, which calls for elaborate wire-line devices.|$|R
