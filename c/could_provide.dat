The traveller professed his willingness to be of any assistance which he <b>could,</b> <b>provided,</b> he added, that it was anything about which he was free to speak.

5|$|A Carbon Trust study {{into the}} {{potential}} of small-scale wind energy in the UK, published in 2010, found that small wind turbines <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> up to 1.5 terawatt hours (TW·h) per year of electric power (0.4% of total UK electric power consumption), saving 0.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (Mt CO2) emission savings. This {{is based on the}} assumption that 10% of households would install turbines at costs competitive with grid electric power, around 12 pence (US 19 cents) a kW·h. A report prepared for the UK's government-sponsored Energy Saving Trust in 2006, found that home power generators of various kinds <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> 30 to 40% of the country's electric power needs by 2050.|$|E
5|$|A {{pipeline}} to the Kenyan port of Lamu is being discussed which <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> an alternative route if Sudan chooses {{to close the}} northern pipeline. It is in China's interest to resolve security problems, and as a major investor and customer of both countries China may have the leverage to achieve this goal.|$|E
5|$|A recent theory {{claims that}} there are {{magnetic}} instabilities {{in the core of}} the Sun that cause fluctuations with periods of either 41,000 or 100,000 years. These <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> a better explanation of the ice ages than the Milankovitch cycles.|$|E

6000|$|At once Dave {{remembered the}} letter {{picked up on}} Bush Island--the letter written by Doctor Montgomery, and asking Jasniff {{to meet him at}} Dunn's on the river. In that {{communication}} the doctor had said he would aid Jasniff all he <b>could,</b> <b>provided</b> the Rockville student would assist him in some transaction involving little risk--which would mean that there must be something [...] "shady" [...] about it.|$|R

5|$|Art Salsberg {{became the}} editor of Popular Electronics in 1974 with a goal of {{reclaiming}} the lead in projects. He wanted to publish a computer project that was more functional and elegant than the Mark-8.

5|$|Born in Lynchburg, Virginia, Morton {{studied at}} the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania despite her family's {{expectation}} that she would only aim to find a husband who <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> for her.

5|$|In The American Species of Crepis, Babcock and Stebbins {{described}} {{the concept of}} the polyploid complex, and its role in plant evolution. Some genera, such as Crepis, have a complex of reproductive forms that center on sexually diploid populations that have also given rise to polyploid ones. Babcock and Stebbins also observed that allopolyploid types formed from the hybridization of two different species always have a wider distribution than diploid or autotetraploid species, and proposed that polyploids formed through hybridization have a greater potential to exploit varied environments, because they inherit all traits from both parents. They also showed that hybridization in the polyploid complex <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> a mechanism for genetic exchange between diploid species that were otherwise unable to breed. Their observations offered insight into species formation and knowledge of how all these complex processes <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> information on the history of a genus. This monograph was described by Swedish botanist Åke Gustafsson as the most important work on the formation of species during that period.|$|E
5|$|The Ravens {{flew the}} entire gamut of U.S. {{observation}} aircraft, from O-1 Bird Dogs, and U-17s, to T-28s and, eventually more modern O-2 Skymasters and OV-10 Broncos. Each Raven carried aloft a Laotian observer, who <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> almost immediate clearance for air strikes. On the ground, Laotian Forward Air Guides (FAGs) also called in for air support missions.|$|E
5|$|There is also local {{potential}} for energy {{crops such as}} short-rotation willow or poplar coppice, miscanthus energy grass, agricultural wastes such as straw and manure, and forestry residues. These crops <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> 0.8 GW of generating capacity.|$|E

5|$|When {{the plan}} was {{presented}} to the Admiralty they refused to support it. The certain loss of one or both destroyers to eliminate the dry dock was out of the question. They suggested they <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> an old Free French destroyer, the Ouragan, and a flotilla of small motor launches to transport the commandos and evacuate them afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Columbian mammoths {{inhabited}} the southern half of North America, {{ranging from the}} northern United States across Mexico {{as far south as}} Costa Rica. One Costa Rican specimen, a molar, was reported in 1963 but has since been lost. The environment in these areas may have had more varied habitats than those inhabited by woolly mammoths in the north (the mammoth steppe). Some areas were covered by grass, herbaceous plants, trees and shrubs; their composition varied from region to region, and included grassland, savanna and aspen parkland habitats. There were also wooded areas; although mammoths would not have preferred forests, clearings <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> them with grass and herbs.|$|E
5|$|During the autopsy, Peter {{explains}} to Sheriff Mathis (Martha Plimpton) how removing {{a part of}} a brain <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> information to the killers. Mathis' partner, deputy officer Bill Ferguson (Patrick Gilmore), soon disappears. After they go to the scene of Krista's murder, Peter encounters Newton, but he escapes. Peter becomes suspicious of Mathis when he sees blood on her jacket; however, he believes her when she shows him her cut from a fall, which is bleeding normal blood, not the mercury typical of shapeshifters; he then explains the concept of shapeshifters to her.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} {{announcement}} proclaiming the ACC's expansion to 12teams, several cities and sports organizations were preparing bids {{to host the}} ACC Football Championship Game. The prospect {{of tens of thousands}} of visitors <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> a multimillion-dollar economic boost for a host city and region while requiring few, if any, additional facilities. One early contender was the city of Charlotte, North Carolina. Even before Virginia Tech, Miami, and Boston College were chosen as the ACC's picks to expand, Carolinas Stadium Corporation, the owner and operator of Charlotte's Ericsson Stadium (as it was called then) lobbied heavily for Charlotte's selection. Other early options included Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta, and Jacksonville.|$|E
5|$|For {{the film}} score, Mizoguchi relied on {{composer}} Fumio Hayasaka and the assistant directors, {{and was not}} involved in their creative process. Fumio Hayasaka was a strong proponent of using Japanese music in Japanese films. For Ugetsu, he employed geza music, common in Kabuki theatre. Additional, uncredited composers were Ichiro Saito and Tamekichi Mochizuki, whose music was blended with Hayasaka's, and <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> accurate music reflective of the period.|$|E
5|$|Goofus and Gallant strips {{have been}} used for {{research}} purposes. A 2006 study gauging the development of ideas of respect and disrespect among American children used strips from the comic as stimuli to which the subjects <b>could</b> <b>provide</b> qualitative responses regarding why they believed Goofus's or Gallant's actions were respectful or disrespectful. A 2012 study used the strips to prompt autistic and allistic children to identify whether the depicted child (either Goofus or Gallant) was behaving badly while researchers used an fMRI to measure the neural networks used in reaching their conclusions.|$|E
