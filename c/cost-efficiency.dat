5|$|Mist is {{responsible}} for the existence of 'magicite', stones that contain magical powers due to the presence of Mist in their crystalline structure. Magicite is divided into three types; spellstones that are used in spell casting, skystones that are installed into a component known as 'glossair rings' that give flight to the vehicles, whether small-sized bikes or large airships, and memstones that function much like recording devices. The quality of magicite depends on the quantity of Mist and not on the size or shape of the stone. The ubiquitousness of magic and magicite, as well as its <b>cost-efficiency,</b> led to it replacing electricity and its various sources as the dominant usable energy in Ivalice.|$|E

2500|$|Sam Houston was re-elected President of Texas on December 12, 1841. He {{had taken}} {{note of the}} Rangers' <b>cost-efficiency</b> and {{increased}} their number to 150. Under Captain John Coffee [...] "Jack" [...] Hays' leadership, the force {{played an important role}} in the defense against the Mexican invasion led by General Adrian Woll in 1842 and against attacks by Indians. Despite his youth at the time, the charismatic Hays was a rallying figure to his men and is often considered responsible for giving cohesion, discipline and a group mentality to the Rangers. Flacco, a chief of the allied Indian tribe of the Lipan, used to call Hays Bravo too much. The adoption of the state-of-the-art five-shot Colt Paterson revolver (which had been turned down by the U.S. Army) was also his work. Hays trained his men to aim, fire and reload their weapons from horseback, a radical innovation from the usual contemporary technique of dismounting before shooting at enemies and reloading, which was a necessity with more cumbersome weaponry. This tactic was put to devastating effect, and it was imitated shortly afterwards by the military, Texian and American. At the suggestion of one of Hays's officers, Samuel Hamilton Walker, these revolvers soon evolved into the famous, enhanced six-shot version, the Walker Colt; 1,000 of these revolvers were issued to the United States Mounted Rifles engaged in the Mexican-American War. During these years, famous Rangers such as Hays, Walker, Benjamin McCulloch and William [...] "Bigfoot" [...] Wallace first established their reputation as frontier fighters.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} the private {{management}} of public housing is an important topic to be critically analyzed as the government search for ways to increase efficiency in providing housing for the poor. Public Housing Authorities must address the cost for repairing or replacing the deteriorating housing stock, {{the increase in the}} need for affordable housing, and the lack of supply. There is growing pressure on efficient use of public funds that has heightened the need for profound structural reform. An important strategy for carrying out such reform is through privatization. Although privatization does not work in every case, the majority position in the traditional privatization literature is that reliance on private organizations normally, but not always, results in cost savings. ^ The primary purpose of this dissertation is to determine whether a consensus exist among decision-makers on the efficiency of privatizing the management of public housing. A secondary purpose is to review the techniques (best practices) used by the private sector that results in <b>cost-efficiencies</b> in the management of public housing. The study employs the use of a triangulated research design utilizing cross-sectional survey methodology that included use of a survey instrument to solicit responses from the private managers. The study consists of qualitative methods using interviews from key informants of private-sector management firms and public housing agencies, case studies, focus groups, archival records and housing authorities documents. ^ Results indicated that important decision-makers perceive that private managers made a positive contribution to <b>cost-efficiencies</b> in the management of public housing. The performance of private contractors served as a yardstick for comparison of efficiency of services that are produced in-house. The study concluded that private managers made the benefits of their management techniques well known creating a sense of competition between public and private managers. Competition from private contractors spurred municipal worker and management productivity improvements creating better management results for the public housing authorities. The study results are in concert with a review of recent research and studies that also concluded private managers have some distinct advantages to controlling costs in the management of public housing. ...|$|R

30|$|Today {{there are}} many sources of big data in {{medicine}} beyond those created directly by physicians in electronic medical records (EMR). Data may be linked from imaging, pharmacy records, laboratory data, ‘omics data (large-scale genomic, metabolomic, and proteomic datasets), and administrative claims from government and private insurers (McKinsie 2011; Monteith et al. 2016 a). In the future, IBM predicts {{that the majority of}} medical data will be created by patients and non-providers from health apps, patient monitoring, and from behavioral data based on the tracking of daily digital transactions (Slabodkin 2015). Important features of big data are massive size, heterogeneity, uneven quality, and the need for sophisticated automated techniques to find meaning. Already, clinical data from many provider systems are being shared in large regional or national databases to improve consistency of care, and to facilitate a wide range of medical research that increasingly involves commercial organizations (Powles 2016; IBM 2016). Both the adoption of digital apps and monitoring devices, and use of analytics on big data from diverse sources are considered the key aspects for improving healthcare and increasing <b>cost-efficiencies</b> (WEF 2016).|$|R

40|$|Conservation auctions {{such as the}} Conservation Reserve Program in the United States and the BushTender Program in Australia {{have been}} used to {{identify}} landholders who can provide on-farm conservation and biodiversity protection actions at lowest cost. These conservation auctions are typically framed as closed, discriminatory, single round, first-price auctions, and are {{based on the assumption that}} landholders will offer bids determined by their 'independent private values'. However bid values may also be influenced by other factors such as concerns about 'winner's curse', a desire to capture economic rent, and premiums for risk and uncertainty factors. Sealed, single round auctions may exacerbate information gaps and uncertainty factors because of the limited information flows compared to traditional market exchanges and open, ascending auctions. In this paper, the <b>cost-efficiencies</b> of a multiple round auction for landholder management actions are explored with the use of field experiments. Results suggest that multiple round auctions may be associated with efficiency gains, particularly in initial rounds. However, multiple round auctions can also involve higher transaction and administration costs, so the net advantages need to be assessed on a case by case basis before these are used to purchase environmental services.

This paper examines four distinct characteristics of 3 D printing that define and predict its revolutionary ramifications on manufacturing processes and the geo-economic contours of global trade. Digital additive manufacturing renders the established manufacturing process obsolete. 3 D printing’s rapid diffusion is a consequence of its vast assortment of applications being freely available on open crowd-sourced websites. When one combines the ability and convenience of producing one’s own customized goods with the savings accrued through the elimination of labor, re-tooling, assembly, shipping and inventory carrying costs, the consequences are most ominous for any and all engaged in traditional manufacturing and dependent on the relative <b>cost-efficiencies</b> of out-sourcing. 3 D printing not only renders factories obsolete but threatens whole country’s economies as production is taken up by the consumer and distribution is de-globalized...|$|R
40|$|The Federal Trade Commission’s {{successful}} {{challenge to}} the proposed merger of Heinz and Beech-Nut baby food operations in 2001 remains a controversial case that raises concern {{over the role of}} cost efficiencies in merger analysis. Although the FTC argued that the merger would result in an increased likelihood of coordinated effects, we develop an alternative explanation for why the merger was likely to harm consumers {{even in the absence of}} such cooperation. We show that a conventional model of vertical product differentiation is able to replicate the premerger market data. Vertical product differentiation assumes that consumers agree on the relative quality of different products, which seems to describe the baby food market. When the model is then used to determine potential post-merger outcomes, we find that only using the most favorable assumptions for Heinz, would the claimed <b>cost-efficiencies</b> have been passed on to consumers. Under any more conservative and realistic scenarios, consumer prices rise substantially. The analysis supports the decision to oppose the merger. It also raises some doubt about the merit of cost efficiencies as a merger defense when an industry is characterized by vertical product differentiation. ...|$|R
40|$|SPBD) Foundation in Samoa {{for many}} {{insightful}} discussions {{on how the}} concept of Franchising Microfinance can be practically implemented {{on the island of}} Savaii in Samoa. Franchising Microfinance Financial intermediaries worldwide are seeking mechanisms for participating in micro lending. We consider a simple model where a bank may use informed “local capitalists ” as intermediaries for on-lending. But the availability of multiple credit sources provides borrowers with an incentive to default voluntarily, making the bank’s on-lending mechanism a non-starter. We explore whether a coalition of local capitalists, effectively limiting borrower’s opportunity for defaulting multiple times, might be sufficient to facilitate on-lending. Instead, we find that a monopoly moneylender with superior enforcement technology can out-compete the local capitalist coalition if the moneylender also enjoys the smallest transactions costs of lending. We show that a credible competitive threat to the monopoly moneylender can only arise if the local capitalist coalition can also be made cost-effective either by direct subsidies or by measures such as standardization, economies of scale and implementation of best practices. We argue that Franchising is one potential mechanism that could deliver both <b>cost-efficiencies</b> as well as ability for local capitalists to form a coalition...|$|R

Industrially relevant features of plant systems include proper eukaryotic protein processing, inherent safety {{due to lack of}} adventitious agents, more facile scalability, faster production (transient systems), and potentially lower costs. Lower manufacturing cost has been widely claimed as an intuitive feature of the platform by the plant-made biologics community, even though cost information resides within a few private companies and studies accurately documenting such an advantage have been lacking. We present two technoeconomic case studies representing plant-made enzymes for diverse applications: human butyrylcholinesterase produced indoors for use as a medical countermeasure and cellulases produced in the field for the conversion of cellulosic biomass into ethanol as a fuel extender. Production economics were modeled based on results reported with the latest-generation expression technologies on Nicotiana host plants. We evaluated process unit operations and calculated bulk active and per-dose or per-unit costs using SuperPro Designer modeling software.

With an increasing emergence of consumer cooperatives in industries such as electricity generation or broadband telecommunications, however, {{there is a need to}} study the specific structure and function of consumer cooperatives in the market economy. In the literature, the growth of consumer cooperatives has been attributed to problems of market failure in conjunction with high risk and uncertain investment. In order to examine incentives for consumers to join a consumer cooperative, we make a distinction between different types of risks and benefits. The evolution of broadband markets in the Netherlands provides an interesting example to examine the function and structure of local cooperatives in a dynamic market. In the paper, we analyze the incentives of 759 consumers to opt in favor of setting up of a cooperative aimed at providing broadband services via a fiber network. We found that the risks associated with creating <b>cost-efficiencies</b> and switching cost are important determinants for consumers to join a cooperative. In addition, benefits expected from consumers with respect to user network externalities and indirect gains derived will affect the probability of consumers to join a cooperative...|$|R
