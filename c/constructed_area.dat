Participants' indicated their level of agreement with statements in the <b>construct</b> <b>areas</b> of health, environment, ethics, regulation, and risk. Responses were compared among survey instruments and to responses to previous surveys of Americans and of shoppers in North Dakota. Organic food was perceived as a healthier and safer choice. Organic practices were perceived to be more environmentally sound. Respondents expressed a level of concern over the unknown effects GM food could have on the environment and society as a whole. However, participants generally felt that genetic modification could be used effectively and valued some of the associated benefits.

40|$|Thesis (Doctoral) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, City and Regional Planning, İzmir, 2008 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 259 - 266) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxix, 267 leavesToday, urbanization {{problems which}} have been experienced in {{the past fifty years}} in our country have also brought about other deep-rooted problems in other sectors. The migration which started in the 1950 s is the major cause of all urban problems. The social and economic problems that arose after migration, later manifested themselves in the physical space; and after the emergence of the first squatter houses a process that later turned into a practice of continuous illegal building construction was to begin. Urban problems have turned into an impasse due to the uncontrolled development and cities spreading hastily towards their peripheries, the changing social structure of cities after migratory waves, continuously mounting spatial problems, lack of policies, an even policies promoting these developments. However, it is stressed by the State Statistics Institute that the speed of population increase will go down significantly in next decades. The decrease in population rate and the focusing of government policies on the transformation of squatter areas give hints for the fact that urban transformation will always be on the agenda in the following years. In this sense, within the scope of this thesis study, especially the transformation processes which formed in the squatter/illegally <b>constructed</b> <b>areas</b> of the post 1980 s in Turkey were investigated in detail. In order to present an objective picture of the transformation processes in those areas, two different samples which experienced the same transformation process in the post 1980 period were selected because different transformation processes emerged in different squatter areas where the same improvement plan was applied. Along with this, as two different work areas, the improvement plans which were applied in the squatter/illegally <b>constructed</b> <b>areas</b> in Ankara-Çankaya and Izmir-Konak municipalities were investigated, and the transformation processes were analyzed and the two different processes were reflected. At the basis of this study lies the need for investigating the urban transformation processes in squatter and illegally <b>constructed</b> <b>areas,</b> which seems especially to be a problem of big towns and metropolitan cities, and also the thought of identifying the problem objectively. This study aims at identifying urban renewal form and how the transformation process has developed, and under what sort of conditions within the present settlement of the Turkish cities, in other words in squatter or illegallyconstructed areas in recent years. In this study, in order to find out under what conditions and in which organizational structure market-based urban transformation processes were realized by individuals and in the leadership of constructors, the squatter/illegally <b>constructed</b> <b>areas</b> in Ankara-Çankaya and İzmir-Konak municipalities, where improvement plans were applied, were comparatively investigated.

The instrument contained questions in four construct areas: general knowledge, transmission, prevention and implications. Demographic information was also collected from the 382 respondents. Statistical analysis of this descriptive/correlational research project indicated that, while 73 % of the participants were aware that hand washing was recommended for prevention of illness, participants provided correct responses at a much lower rate in the areas of general knowledge of E. coli, implications of contracting and transmission of the bacteria. Correlational analysis indicated that several low correlations existed between demographic variables and individual items as well as <b>construct</b> <b>areas.</b> Previous participation in FFA or 4 -H was positively correlated to <b>construct</b> <b>areas</b> 2 and 3. This participation also had a low positive correlation with the overall score on the instrument indicating that involvement in one of these youth agricultural leadership organizations was related to a higher level of knowledge about the dangers of E. coli 0157 :H 7.
