40|$|This paper reviews public {{transport}} <b>crowding</b> valuation research, using {{a number of}} primary studies conducted in the UK, USA, Australia and Israel. We identify three measures used to value <b>crowding</b> (a time multiplier, a monetary value per time unit and a monetary value per trip), and associated ways of representing <b>crowding</b> in stated preference experiments. Although {{a number of different}} types of <b>crowding</b> in terms of location are identified, namely in-vehicle, access-way, entrance and platform/station, the majority of reviewed studies investigate only in-vehicle <b>crowding.</b> Despite the different characteristics of the reviewed studies, they all report that <b>crowding</b> would increase the value of travel time savings, which can be viewed as an additional component of generalised time.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of niching {{techniques}} have been investigated in evolutionary and genetic algorithms. In this article, we focus on niching using <b>crowding</b> techniques {{in the context of}} what we call local tournament algorithms.

40|$|<b>Crowding</b> impedes the {{identification}} of flanked objects in peripheral vision. Prior studies have shown <b>crowding</b> strength decreases with target–flanker similarity. Research on <b>crowding</b> in Chinese-character recognition has been scarce in the literature. We aimed to fill the research gap by examining the effects of structural similarity on Chinese-character <b>crowding.</b> Regularity in within-character configuration, i. e., orthographic legality, of flankers was manipulated in Experiment 1. Target–flanker similarity in orthographic legality did not affect <b>crowding</b> strength, measured as contrast threshold elevation. <b>Crowding</b> weakened only when the strokes in the flankers were scrambled. Contour integrity of flankers was manipulated by randomly perturbing the phase spectra of the stimulus images in Experiments 2 a and 2 b. <b>Crowding</b> by perturbed-phase flankers remained robust but was weaker compared with intact-phase flankers. Target–flanker similarity in contour integrity modulated <b>crowding</b> strength.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the extent and specificity of <b>crowding</b> in the normal fovea and periphery, and the central field of amblyopes, using “C”-like patterns. In the first experiment we measured the extent of <b>crowding</b> for C-patterns comprised of Gaussian patches, over a range of target sizes using a four-alternative forced-choice (up, down, left, right) method. We found that the extent of foveal <b>crowding</b> is proportional to target size. In contrast, in normal periphery and in the central field of amblyopes, <b>crowding</b> extends over large spatial distances and is not size dependent. <b>Crowding</b> for our stimuli occurred with both same-polarity and opposite polarity patches. To test whether the extended <b>crowding</b> in amblyopia resulted from a shift in the spatial scale of analysis, we measured <b>crowding</b> with band-limited C-patterns (comprised of Gabor patches) in a gap localization task (2 -AFC). With band-limited stimuli, and a task that does not involve judging the orientation of the gap, the amblyopic eyes showed <b>crowding</b> over a longer distance than that of normal observers. We also tested the orientation specificity of <b>crowding</b> by varying the orientation of the flanks. In normal fovea, <b>crowding</b> is orientation specific: in amblyopia it is not. While <b>crowding</b> in normal fovea can be explained by simple pattern masking, <b>crowding</b> seen in normal periphery and amblyopes cannot. Instead we suggest that <b>crowding</b> in amblyopic and peripheral vision is a result of extended pooling at a stage following the stage of feature detection...|$|R

40|$|Perception of {{peripherally}} viewed shapes is impaired when {{surrounded by}} similar shapes. This phenomenon is {{commonly referred to}} as "crowding". Although studied extensively for perception of characters (mainly letters) and, to a lesser extent, for orientation, little is known about whether and how <b>crowding</b> affects perception of other features. Nevertheless, current <b>crowding</b> models suggest that the effect should be rather general and thus not restricted to letters and orientation. Here, we report on a series of experiments investigating <b>crowding</b> in the following elementary feature dimensions: size, hue, and saturation. <b>Crowding</b> effects in these dimensions were benchmarked against those in the orientation domain. Our primary finding is that all features studied show clear signs of <b>crowding.</b> First, identification thresholds increase with decreasing mask spacing.

40|$|<b>Crowding</b> {{in outdoor}} {{recreation}} has received considerable attention in academic literature, {{in relation to}} its ability to cause both physical and perceptual impacts. In particular, the influence of <b>crowding</b> on visitors’ satisfaction has received much consideration. Nonetheless, these {{studies have focused on}} <b>crowding</b> and satisfaction during peak periods of visitation. Focusing studies on peak periods seems logical, as this is when a destination experiences high visitation, and consequent potential for <b>crowding.</b> However, collecting data during peak season has an important conceptual issue; visitors particularly sensitive to <b>crowding</b> implement coping mechanisms, such as activity substitution and spatial and temporal displacement, and may not be on-site during potentially <b>crowded</b> times. This paper presents results of the influence of <b>crowding</b> on satisfaction during the off-season at Port Campbell National Park in Victoria, Australia. The major finding was that relatively high levels of <b>crowding</b> were still perceived during the off-season, and the influence on satisfaction was apparent. A leading implication for protected area managers is the recognition that <b>crowding</b> is not limited to peak visitation periods.

40|$|Purpose. : <b>Crowding</b> {{describes}} the increased difficulty in identifying a target object {{when it is}} surrounded by nearby objects (flankers). A recent study investigated the effect of age on visual <b>crowding</b> and found equivocal results: Although <b>crowded</b> visual acuity was worse in older participants, <b>crowding</b> expressed as a ratio did not change with age. However, the spatial extent of <b>crowding</b> is a better index of <b>crowding</b> effects and remains unknown. In the present study, we used established psychophysical methods to characterize the effect of age on visual <b>crowding</b> (magnitude and extent) in a letter recognition task. Methods. : Letter recognition thresholds were determined for three different flanker separations in 54 adults (aged 18 – 76 years) with normal vision. Additionally, the spatial extent of <b>crowding</b> was established by measuring spacing thresholds: the flanker-to-target separation required to produce a given reduction in performance. Uncrowded visual acuity, <b>crowded</b> visual acuity, and spacing thresholds were expressed {{as a function of}} age, avoiding arbitrary categorization of young and old participants. Results. : Our results showed that uncrowded and <b>crowded</b> visual acuities do not change significantly as a function of age. Furthermore, spacing thresholds did not change with age and approximated Bouma's law (half eccentricity). Conclusions. : These data show that <b>crowding</b> in adults is unaffected by senescence and provide additional evidence for distinct neural mechanisms mediating surround suppression and visual <b>crowding,</b> since the former shows a significant age effect. Finally, our data suggest that the well-documented age-related decline in peripheral reading ability is not due to age-related changes in visual <b>crowding...</b>|$|R
