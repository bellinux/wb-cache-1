40|$|Abstract: Among the {{complete}} family of sensors for automotive safety, consumer and industrial application, <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> {{stand out as}} one of the most important. Actually, <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> have the diversity to be used in a broad range of applications. In today’s automotive industry, such sensors are used in the antilock braking system, the traction control system and the electronic stability program. Also, typical applications are cam and crank shaft position/speed and wheel and turbo shaft speed measurement. In addition, they are used to control a variety of functions, including fuel injection, ignition timing in engines, and so on. However, some types of <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> cannot respond to very low speeds for different reasons. What is more, the main reason why such sensors are not good at detecting very low speeds is that they are more susceptible to noise when the speed of the target is low. In short, they suffer from noise and generally only work at medium to high speeds. This is one of the drawbacks of the inductive (magnetic reluctance) <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> and is the case under study. Furthermore, there are other <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> like the differential Hall Effect sensors that are relatively immune to interference and noise, but they cannot detect static fields. This limits their operations to speeds which give a switching frequency greater than a minimu...|$|R
40|$|Water heating {{applications}} {{consume a}} considerable portion of electricity demand {{in most of}} countries. Small wind turbines are one of attractive alternatives for grid electricity based water heating systems. Wind energy {{can be converted to}} heat energy in a high efficient manner. However it is essential that wind turbine based water heating systems should be economical and reliable. Maximum power point tracking algorithm of most of available wind turbines requires information from a wind <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> and a rotor <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> which reduces the reliability of the system. In this paper, the proposed 5 kW wind turbine does not require external wind <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> and rotor <b>speed</b> <b>sensors.</b> The system is consistent with sensorless maximum power point tracking algorithm, which eliminates the need for both wind speed and rotor <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> and gives a highly reliable solution for water heating applications. Internal voltage and current sensors are used to measure the output voltage, the output current {{and the power of the}} generator. Using those measurements, the sliding-mode observer can accurately estimate the rotor speed and position and which is used in the maximum power point tracking algorithm. To calculate the optimum rotor speed, the generator output power measurements are used with power signal feedback method. The effectiveness of the proposed system is verified using a simulation model by comparing the performances with a sensor based model...|$|R

50|$|Some sensors {{now offer}} an {{integrated}} signal processor {{that attempts to}} correct the offset and amplitude of the Hall sensor signals. This correction enables a larger maximum permissible air gap at the <b>speed</b> <b>sensor.</b> On a module m = 1 target wheel these new sensors can tolerate an air gap of 1.4 mm, which is wider than that for conventional <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> on module m = 2 target wheels. On a module m = 2 target wheel the new <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> can tolerate gap {{of as much as}} 2.2 mm. It has also been possible to markedly increase the signal quality. Both the duty cycle and the phase displacement between the two channels is at least three times as stable in the face of fluctuating air gap and temperature drift. In addition, in spite of the complex electronics it has also been possible to increase the mean time between failures for the new <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> by a factor of three to four. So they not only provide more precise signals, their signal availability is also significantly better.|$|R

In order to detect <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> faults, a threshold-based scheme is proposed.

The <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> for the rear wheels is located in the rear axle. This system provides individual control of the front wheels, so they can both achieve maximum braking force. The rear wheels, however, are monitored together; they both have to start to lock up before the ABS will activate on the rear. With this system, it is possible that one of the rear wheels will lock during a stop, reducing brake effectiveness. This system is easy to identify, as there are no individual <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> for the rear wheels.|$|R
