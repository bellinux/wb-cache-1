25|$|The use of lead glaze {{has several}} {{advantages}} over alkali glazes {{in addition to}} their greater optical refractivity. Lead compounds in suspension may be added directly to the <b>ceramic</b> <b>body.</b> Alkali glazes must first be mixed with silica and fritted prior to use, since they are soluble in water, requiring additional labor. A successful glaze must not crawl, or peel away from the pottery surface upon cooling, leaving areas of unglazed ceramic. Lead reduces this risk by reducing the surface tension of the glaze. It must not craze, forming a network of cracks, caused when the thermal contraction of the glaze and the <b>ceramic</b> <b>body</b> do not match properly. Ideally, the glaze contraction should be 5–15% less than the body contraction, as glazes are stronger under compression than under tension. A high-lead glaze has a linear expansion coefficient of between 5 and 7×10−6/°C, compared to 9 to 10×10−6/°C for alkali glazes. Those of earthenware ceramics vary between 3 and 5×10−6/°C for non-calcareous bodies and 5 to 7×10−6/°C for calcareous clays, or those containing 15–25% CaO. Therefore, the thermal contraction of lead glaze matches that of the ceramic more closely than an alkali glaze, rendering it less prone to crazing. A glaze should also have a low enough viscosity to prevent the formation of pinholes as trapped gasses escape during firing, typically between 900–1100°C, but not so low as to run off. The relatively low viscosity of lead glaze mitigates this issue. It may also have been cheaper to produce than alkali glazes.|$|E

25|$|A common {{degradation}} {{issue in}} ceramics involves soluble salts. Soluble salts can either enter the clay {{body from the}} environment, for example from being buried underground for decades, or they are already naturally occurring due to {{the components of the}} materials or clay used. Non-archaeological objects, such as modern dishware, can acquire salts from normal use such as storing salt. Soluble salts respond to changes in humidity both high and low. In high humidity salts become soluble and in low humidity they crystallize. The changing from soluble to crystallization and back damages the surface of the ceramic because salt crystals are larger than liquid salt and therefore will shrink and expand the <b>ceramic</b> <b>body.</b> A white haze on the surface is the first indication of soluble salts, which is the salt crystallizing. Overtime the physical component of the body will crumble until it is completely destroyed.|$|E
