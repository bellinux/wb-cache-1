40|$|Abstract. 1. Predator and {{alternative}} food density are important factors influencing herbivore suppression by generalist predators. Herbivore suppression {{can be reduced}} if predators forage preferentially on alternative foods. Cannibalism can increase at high predator densities, further reducing herbivore suppression. However, complex interactions are possible, as alternative food can increase predator abundance and survival restoring top-down effects on herbivores. 2. In two species of carabid larvae (Poecilus chalcites and Anisodactylus ovularis), we studied how alternative foods (fly pupae and grass seeds) and predator density affect predation of black cutworm larvae and how alternative foods affect cannibalism among carabid larvae. 3. Adding alternative food to microcosms generally reduced total predation of cutworms. However, {{the strength of this}} effect was dependent on carabid species, larval density, and food type. 4. Increasing larval density from one to three per microcosm reduced per-capita predation by both species irrespective of alternative food treatment. 5. Alternative food reduced cannibalism in both carabid species and increased survival of carabid larvae in field plots, such that twice as many were captured in plots subsidised with pupae than plots with no alternative food. 6. These results provide new insight into the complex interactions that influence predator survival and herbivore suppression in resource diverse habitats by demon-strating the primacy of intraguild interactions among carabid larvae.

40|$|Cellular protein {{interaction}} {{networks are}} a result of the binding preferences of a particular protein and the entirety of interactors that mutually compete for binding sites. Therefore, the reconstruction of interaction networks by the accumulation of interaction networks for individual proteins will greatly overestimate connectivity within the network. Here, we addressed the impact of intracellular complexity on signalling networks using microarrays that carried a collection of peptides binding to the GRB 2 SH 2 and SH 3 domains. Binding patterns and affinities for the recombinant adaptor protein GRB 2 were compared with the ones for the protein in cell lysates. Peptide microarrays were titrated with the histidine-tagged recombinant protein, cell lysates or mixtures of both. Indeed, for recombinant GRB 2, binding was detected for more peptides than for GRB 2 in cell lysates. Moreover, binding was also observed for poor binders. It was impossible to define affinity thresholds for the binding of the recombinant protein to enable a discrimination of physiologically relevant interactions. Titrations of recombinant protein with lysate confirmed competition as the basis for fewer interactions. Importantly, the methods presented here enable the description of physiologically relevant binding patterns for proteins of interest and the identification of those peptide motifs, which are most strongly affected by <b>competition.</b> <b>BIOLOGICAL</b> SIGNIFICANCE: The biological significance of protein-protein interactions can only be addressed in a physiologically meaningful way {{in the presence of the}} endogenous proteome which may contain proteins that compete for binding sites. Using peptide microarrays, we here demonstrate for the adaptor protein GRB 2 that this competition strongly reduces the number of interactions with other signalling proteins...|$|E

40|$|SummaryWe {{designed}} a minilibrary of 55 small molecule peptidomimetics based on β-turns of the neurotrophin growth factor polypeptides neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3) and nerve growth factor (NGF).

Agonism is intrinsic to the peptidomimetic ligand (in {{the absence of}} neurotrophins), and/or can also be detected as potentiation of neurotrophin action. Remarkably, some peptidomimetics afford both neurotrophic activities of cell survival and neuronal differentiation, while others afford discrete signals leading to either survival or differentiation.

Mortality of N. viridula eggs was higher in simultaneous and sequential releases compared to single species releases. In simultaneous host exploitations, T. basalis females displayed an aggressive behavior against O. telenomicida females. The outcome of multiparasitism showed that interspecific larval competition was dominated by O. telenomicida regardless of the sequence in which oviposition occurred and which parasitoid was or was not simultaneously released in the patch.

40|$|Question: Is the {{coexistence}} of {{a continuum of}} species or ecological types possible in real-world communities? Or should one expect distinctly different species? Mathematical methods: We study whether the {{coexistence of}} species in a continuum of ecological types is (a) dynamically stable (against changes in population densities) and (b) structurally robust (against changes in population dynamics). Since most of the reviewed investigations are based on Lotka-Volterra models, we carefully explain which of the presented conclusions are model-independent. mathematical conclusions: Seemingly plausible models with dynamically stable continuous- coexistence solutions do exist. However, these models either depend on biologically unrealistic mathematical assumptions (e. g. non-differentiable ingredient functions) or are structurally unstable (i. e. destroyable by arbitrarily small modifications to those ingredient functions).

Most gene products are now annotated by homology, in which an experimentally determined function is applied to a similar sequence.

Here, we propose a computational method of assignment of function, termed Generalized Functional Linkages (GFL), that combines nonhomology-based methods with other types of data.

Random motion has a homogenizing effect and then delays this clustering instability. When individuals from species differing in their random walk characteristics are allowed to compete together, the ones with a tendency to form narrower clusters get a competitive advantage over the others.

Assuming conditions promoting non-cooperative behaviour, we demonstrate that intergenerational migration determines whether evolutionary competition results in a `homo economicus' (showing self-regarding preferences) or a `homo socialis' (having other-regarding preferences). Our model assumes spatially interacting agents playing prisoner's dilemmas, who inherit a trait determining `friendliness', but mutations tend to undermine it. Reproduction is ruled by fitness-based selection without a cultural modification of reproduction rates. Our model calls for a complementary economic theory for `networked minds' (the `homo socialis') and lays the foundations for an evolutionarily grounded theory of other-regarding agents, explaining individually different utility functions as well as conditional cooperation...|$|R

In all cases, advection leads to a striking drop in the fixation time, as well as a large reduction in the global carrying capacity. Despite localization on convergence zones, one species goes extinct much more rapidly than in well-mixed populations. For a weak harmonic potential, one finds a bimodal distribution of fixation times.

The replicator equation {{is a standard}} paradigm in evolutionary dynamics. The growth rate of each strategy is its excess fitness: the deviation of its fitness from the average.

Two well-known replicator systems are the threestrategy Rock-Paper-Scissors game and the two-strategy Hawk-Dove game. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of replicator systems with three different types of modifications. The first generalization of the replicator model is given by considering alternate growth functions. We find that in the Rock-Paper-Scissors game with a logistic growth function, there are several fixed points that do not exist in the standard replicator model. The system exhibits both periodic motion and convergence to attractors. We also analyze replicator systems with delayed interactions between strategies. We consider a symmetric delay model, in which the fitness of each strategy is its expected payoff delayed by a time interval; and an asymmetric model, in which same-strategy terms appearing in the fitness of a given strategy are not delayed. In both cases, limit cycles arise that cannot occur in the usual replicator model. Finally, we examine Rock-Paper-Scissors systems with quasiperiodic forcing of the payoff coefficients. This model may represent systems in which the competition is affected by cyclical processes on different time-scales. We find that the stability of the equilibrium state depends sensitively on the two forcing frequencies; in fact, the region of stability has fractal boundary. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|R

We use known models of population dynamics for three agents: two phases asexual and sexual (for instance) of the same species and one of resources.
