5|$|The mouse <b>cursor</b> {{helps to}} provide visual cues for player actions and movement. The <b>cursor</b> {{appears as a}} hand that changes {{depending}} on what the player is hovering the <b>cursor</b> over. For example, to move in a direction, the <b>cursor</b> changes to point in the intended direction. If players can view an item in greater detail, the <b>cursor</b> changes to a hand holding a magnifying glass. By clicking and dragging the <b>cursor,</b> the player performs actions such as pushing, pulling, and tapping items.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower is a point-and-click {{adventure}} {{game with}} 3D graphics. The player may use a PlayStation controller or mouse {{to move the}} <b>cursor</b> on the screen. The <b>cursor</b> will change shape when placed over certain objects, which the player can click to interact with. Clicking in any location will guide the player character in that direction. Moving the <b>cursor</b> {{to the top of}} the screen will reveal the player's inventory. Clicking an item and then clicking an object on the screen will use the item on that object or in that location. Some items such as keys are used automatically when clicked.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a concept using fake <b>cursors</b> to {{disguise}} on-screen password entry. We performed two user studies with different amounts of dummy <b>cursors</b> and differently colored <b>cursors.</b> The results show that dummy <b>cursors</b> significantly improve security. At the same time, decrease in performance is kept within an acceptable range. Depending on the required degree of security, the studies favor 8 or 16 differently colored <b>cursors</b> as the best trade-off between security and usability...|$|R

5|$|The player {{character}} has {{three levels of}} strength. The strength level is indicated by the <b>cursor</b> which will either be white, flashing yellow, or red. Strength will decrease after extreme actions or being attacked by the game's enemy, Scissorman, and recovers with time. When the character's life is being threatened, the <b>cursor</b> will blink red, indicating panic mode. If the character is being chased, click points are only effective on objects that will make Scissorman retreat. In escape mode, actions do not lower strength and recovery is suspended. This mode stays active until Scissorman is somehow forced to retreat. If the player's strength reaches zero, then it is game over and the player must continue from the last room they entered with one level of strength.|$|E
50|$|Pointer editors are {{occasionally}} {{combined with}} icon editors, because computer icons and <b>cursors</b> share similar properties. Both contain small raster images and the file format used to store icons and static <b>cursors</b> in Microsoft Windows is similar.|$|R
5000|$|Packages are {{groups of}} conceptually linked functions, procedures, variables, PL/SQL table and record TYPE statements, constants, <b>cursors</b> etc. The use of {{packages}} promotes re-use of code. Packages {{are composed of}} the package specification and an optional package body. The specification is the interface to the application; it declares the types, variables, constants, exceptions, <b>cursors,</b> and subprograms available. The body fully defines <b>cursors</b> and subprograms, and so implements the specification.Two advantages of packages are: ...|$|R

5|$|Combat {{occurs in}} real-time, and the player {{character}} may use both melee and ranged weapons. The player attacks by holding the <b>cursor</b> over the game screen and clicking, depressing the button longer to inflict greater damage. Some weapons allow for {{different types of}} attacks depending on where the <b>cursor</b> is held; for example, clicking {{near the bottom of}} the screen may result in a jab, while clicking in the middle produces a slash. Simulated dice rolls occur behind the scenes to determine weapon accuracy. Enemies sometimes try to escape when near death, and the game's stealth mechanics may occasionally be used to avoid combat altogether. The player may cast spells by selecting an appropriate combination of runestones. Like mantras, runestones must be found in the game world before use. There are over forty spells, some undocumented; their effects range from causing earthquakes to allowing the player character to fly.|$|E
5|$|On the {{completion}} of this task, BootX takes over the startup process configuring the keyboard and display, claiming and reserving memory for various purposes and {{checking to see if}} various key combinations are being pressed. After this process has been completed BootX displays the grey Apple logo, spins the spinning wait <b>cursor,</b> and proceeds to load the kernel and some kernel extensions and start the kernel.|$|E
25|$|Some {{oscilloscopes}} have <b>cursors,</b> {{which are}} lines {{that can be}} moved about the screen to measure the time interval between two points, or the difference between two voltages. A few older oscilloscopes simply brightened the trace at movable locations. These <b>cursors</b> are more accurate than visual estimates referring to graticule lines.|$|R
50|$|One {{has to pay}} {{attention}} when using holdable <b>cursors,</b> however. Connections {{can be used by}} different applications. Thus, once a transaction has been ended and committed, a subsequent transaction (running in a different application) could inherit existing holdable <b>cursors.</b> Therefore, an application developer has to be aware of that situation.|$|R

5|$|The {{player can}} {{navigate}} {{and interact with}} the game's environment, mainly carriages on the Orient Express, through use of a context-sensitive <b>cursor.</b> The <b>cursor</b> changes when it is placed over an item with which the player can interact, {{and can be used}} to talk to other characters, listen to other characters' conversations, look around the environment, and move. The player can walk to a location with a single click, and run to a location with a double-click. Double-clicking {{on the edge of the}} screen instantly takes the player to the next screen. There is a map of the train in the game's interface at the top of the screen, and once each carriage has been unlocked, the player can click on any part of the map and instantly be transported to that location, saving the player from having to travel through the train screen by screen. Another accessible feature is an objectives menu interface which states the general tasks the player should be attempting to complete. This menu is designed to guide players in the right direction without giving any explicit hints.|$|E
5|$|By {{gathering}} clues and {{manipulating the}} environment, the player solves thematically linked puzzles. For example, the book leading to Voltaic is accessed by aligning beams of light across a canyon; the Age itself contains similar energy-based puzzles. Edanna's plant-filled puzzles require {{manipulation of the}} Age's ecosystem. Puzzles often involve observing interactions between elements of the environment, then adjusting the links between them. The player can also pick up and view journals or pages written by game characters which reveal back-story and give hints to solving puzzles. <b>Cursor</b> Mode allows the player to select items from a personal inventory {{at the bottom of}} the screen.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower is a {{survival}} horror point-and-click adventure game developed {{and published by}} Human Entertainment for the Super Famicom in 1995. It is the first installment in the Clock Tower series. The story follows orphan Jennifer Simpson soon after she is adopted by the Barrows family along with other orphaned girls. With the introduction of Scissorman, the game's antagonist, {{one of the other}} children is killed. Jennifer must then explore the Barrows Mansion {{to find a way to}} escape while evading Scissorman, leading to one of the game's multiple endings. Clock Tower utlizes a point and click interface with the player controlling a <b>cursor</b> to direct Jennifer's actions.|$|E

5|$|Clock Tower is a {{survival}} horror point-and-click adventure game with 2D graphics. The player controls a <b>cursor</b> {{to direct the}} main character, Jennifer Simpson, and give commands such as investigating objects or opening doors. Jennifer can walk and run, although running will reduce her stamina, in which case she may recover her stamina by sitting on the floor. Jennifer's character portrait {{in the corner of}} the screen will change depending on her stamina level. In addition to interacting with objects in the game, Jennifer can also store them as inventory for later use. The layout of items changes with each play-through.|$|E
5|$|Drowned God uses a point-and-click {{interface}} {{and first}} person perspective typical of games similar to Myst of the mid- to late-1990s. The player navigates and {{interacts with the}} game world by clicking the mouse on {{different parts of the}} screen. The mouse <b>cursor</b> changes shape depending on the action clicking will perform: an arrow for moving to another location, a face with an arrow to pick up or place Tarot cards, and an Eye of Providence for activating or interacting with objects in the environment. Frequent cutscenes provide background information and advance the storyline.|$|E
5|$|During investigations, {{which usually}} take place before or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and evidence {{by talking to}} characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. The player is able to move around a <b>cursor</b> to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a <b>cursor</b> to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow into the microphone to reveal the prints. Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.|$|E

5|$|Empires: Dawn of the Modern World is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) game {{in which}} the player guides a civilization through five historical periods, from the Middle Ages to World War II. As in many RTS titles, the player collects natural resources, erects buildings, and trains and maintains a military. Players use a mouse <b>cursor</b> interface (or hotkeys) to direct their units, which range from crossbowmen to King Tiger tanks. A three-dimensional (3D) camera system allows the player to view the action from any perspective, including isometric and first-person angles. A mini-map is included as well.|$|E
5|$|From Dust {{is a god}} video game, {{designed}} by Ã‰ric Chahi and developed by Ubisoft Montpellier. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Arcade in 2011. Described as a spiritual successor to Populous, the game revolves around The Breath, which was summoned by a tribe to help them seek and recover their lost knowledge. In the game, players, controlling a <b>cursor,</b> can manipulate matter such as lava, soil, and water. Players can help the tribespeople to overcome challenges including finding different totems and overcoming natural disasters. In addition to the story mode, the game features a Challenge mode which offers a shorter, but harder experience.|$|E
5|$|In From Dust, players {{assume a}} god-like, first-person {{perspective}} {{from which they}} manipulate an archipelago environment {{in an effort to}} save and enlighten a nomadic tribe and help them to seek their lost knowledge. With a spherical <b>cursor,</b> the user controls certain types of matter in real time. Lava cools to form solid rock, vegetation propagates in soil and spreads naturally once a village is built, and moving water quickly erodes the terrain. Physical changes to the world occur extremely rapidly, allowing players to restructure islands within minutes.|$|E
