Israel failed to retrieve three dead soldiers, who were left behind in Karameh along with several damaged Israeli vehicles and tanks—later paraded in Amman by the Jordanians.

5|$|Building on the {{features}} of the XT, Ford Australia at one point considered not releasing the sports-oriented Falcon XR6 because of the new XR6 Turbo model.

The naturally aspirated engine was identical to the engine used on the XT and Futura, and the five-speed manual transmission <b>came</b> <b>as</b> standard.|$|E

He felt Bradley had been given ample warning.|$|E
5|$|Containing autobiographical themes, a {{majority}} of the album's lyrics <b>came</b> <b>as</b> the result of a series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph {{and the rest of the}} Jackson family, hiring the A executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization. It has also been regarded as a template upon which numerous female artists have modeled their careers, particularly black women.|$|E
