6000|$|Does this intrepid writer {{think he}} has {{sufficiently}} disguised the matter, by that stale artifice of altering the story, and putting it as a supposed case? Did any man who ever saw the <b>congratulatory</b> <b>speech,</b> read either of those paragraphs in the [...] "Medley," [...] without interpreting them just as I have done? Will the author declare upon his great sincerity, that he never had any such meaning? Is it enough, that a jury at Westminster-Hall would, perhaps, not find him guilty of defaming the Speaker and Mr. Harley in that paper? which however, I am much in doubt of too; and must think the law very defective, if the reputation of such persons must lie {{at the mercy of}} such pens. I do not remember to have seen any libel, supposed to be writ with caution and double meaning, in order to prevent prosecution, delivered under so thin a cover, or so unartificially made up as this; whether it were from an apprehension of his readers' dullness, or an effect of his own. He hath transcribed the very phrases of the Speaker, {{and put them in a}} different character, for fear they might pass unobserved, and to prevent all possibility of being mistaken. I shall be pleased to see him have recourse to the old evasion, and say, that I who make the application, am chargeable with the abuse: let any reader of either party be judge. But I cannot forbear asserting, as my opinion, that for a m[inist]ry to endure such open calumny, without calling the author to account, is next to deserving it. And this is an omission I venture to charge upon the present m[inist]ry, who are too apt to despise little things, which however have not always little consequences.|$|E

He retained his seat over the next seven elections, eventually rising to the position of Secretary-General of the Rikken Minseitō political party. Nagai was known for his strong oratory, combining ponderous speech with colorful or flamboyant phrases.

5000|$|In 1630 Drummond again {{began to}} reside {{permanently}} at Hawthornden, and in 1632 he married Elizabeth Logan, by {{whom he had}} five sons and four daughters. In 1633 Charles made his coronation-visit to Scotland; and Drummond's pen was employed in writing <b>congratulatory</b> <b>speeches</b> and verses. He was involved in organising the King's triumphal procession through Edinburgh. As Drummond preferred Episcopacy to Presbytery, and was an extremely loyal subject, he supported Charles's general policy, though he protested against the methods employed to enforce it. When John Elphinstone, 2nd Lord Balmerino was put on his trial on the capital charge of retaining in his possession a petition regarded as a libel on the king's government, Drummond in an energetic [...] "Letter" [...] (1635) urged the injustice and folly of the proceedings. About this time a claim by the earl of Menteith to the earldom of Strathearn, {{which was based on}} the assertion that Robert III, husband of Annabella Drummond, was illegitimate, roused the poet's pride of blood and prompted him to prepare an historical defence of his house.|$|R

After the opening remarks, the congress' agenda was decided: [...] "(1) Summing up the work of the Party Central Committee; (2) Evaluation of the work of the Party Central Auditing Committee; (3) Revision of the Party Rules and (4) Election of the central leading agencies of the Party." [...] This was followed by a report on the Central Committee's performance since the 5th Congress.

Lee Nak-bin then delivered a report on the work of the Central Auditing Committee since the 5th Congress. The rest of the day was spent discussing the Central Committee report. 13 October was devoted to debates and <b>congratulatory</b> <b>speeches,</b> and on 14 October the congress elected the 6th Central Committee and the 6th Central Auditing Committee.|$|R

After Grandsanta knocks the board off the table, Steve's PDA (a high tech device named a 'HOHO') flashes and he leaves the table in a hurry. Later, their father shares with his wife Margaret his grave doubts about his self-identity should he retire.|$|E

Biographical material on Siegmund Salfeld will be found in two series: Series I: Personal and Series IV: Clippings about Siegmund Salfeld and his Writings. Series I holds official papers such as Salfeld's birth certificate and naturalization documents as well as educational {{documents in}}cluding copies of his doctoral degree.

Correspondence is located mainly in Series II, although there are also letters of congratulation among the documents on honors granted to Salfeld in Series I. The correspondence in Series II contains letters from prominent Jewish individuals, including Leo Baeck and Martin Buber, among others.

Some letters concerning his retirement will also be found in Series II. Users should note that most of the correspondence is handwritten. Examples of Siegmund Salfeld's writing will be found almost entirely in Series III. These works include both published and unpublished articles and sermons written by him. Many of the articles focus on Jewish history. His sermons consisted of funeral services for individuals, including nobility, and <b>congratulatory</b> <b>speeches</b> given at celebrations of Jewish organizations and for specific individuals. Two poems written by Salfeld will be found in Series I. The following individuals are mentioned in this collection:Brann, Markus; Buber, Martin; Delitzsch, Franz; Deutsch, Gotthard; Elbogen, Ismar; Karpeles, Gustav; Kaufmann, David; Lazarus, Moritz; Nobel, Nehemias Anton; Philippson, Martin; Steinschneider, MoritzThe LBI Library holds copies of sixteen of Siegmund Salfeld's published works. Salomon Benjamin Salfeld was born on March 24, 1843 in Stadthagen (Niedersachsen), the son of Benjamin and Adele Salfeld. At some point before he began his university studies, his first name was changed to Siegmund. After completing his general education, Salfeld became a teacher. At this time he met Zipporah Herzberg, his future wife, from Oschersleben-Bode (Anhalt). Her father was opposed to their marriage due to the young couple's financial situation, and Siegmund Salfeld went to Berlin, where he taught at the Auerbach Orphan Asylum while continuing his studies at the University of Berlin and the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums. One of his teachers was the Jewish historian Moritz Steinschneider. In January 1870 Salfeld received his doctorate in philosophy and the liberal arts. Once he had completed his studies, Siegmund Salfeld married Zipporah Herzberg. By August 1870, Siegmund Salfeld was working as a preacher (Prediger) for the Jewish community in Dessau. After further studying the Jewish scriptures, he became a rabbi in 1878. Siegmund and Zipporah Salfeld remained in Dessau for ten years, where they had four sons: Ludwig, Heinz, Erich, and Albert. To earn extra money they also started a boarding house for Jewish boys. Salfeld maintained close relations with both the Jews and Gentiles in his community, and in 1876 was elected a city councilman. In 1880 Siegmund Salfeld became a rabbi of the Jewish community in Mainz, in the then Archduchy of Hessen. The Salfeld family lived across the street from the archduke's palace, in the same building as the community's Hebrew school. It was in Mainz that Siegmund Salfeld wrote his most recognized work, Das Martyrologium des Nürnberger Memorbuches, which was published in 1898. This was a scholarly work that focused not only on the book referenced in the title, but also on the Jews of Nuremberg and Germany during the Middle Ages. Salfeld also taught at both the Hebrew school and the city Gymnasium, and was a member of the local school board. He established a library for the community, comprised of scholarly works of biblical, Hebrew, and Jewish literature, and maintained the records of the Jewish community. In addition to publishing some of his sermons, Salfeld also had many works of religious and local historical interest published; often these articles appeared in periodicals and Festschriften, although some sermons, especially those for nobility, were printed in newspapers. Some examples of his published writings included: Dr. Salomon Herxheimer (1885); Der alte israelitische Friedhof in und die hebräischen Inschriften des Mainzer Museums (1898); Die Judenpolitik Philipps der Großmütigen (1904); Vorboten der Judenemanzipation in Kurmainz (1912); Zur Geschichte des Judenschutzes in Kurmainz (1916); and Zur Kunde des Mainzer jüdischen Vereinsleben in achtzehnten Jahrhundert (1919). Salfeld also wrote articles that were included in Germania Judaica, the Jewish Encyclopedia, and Mayer's Konversationslexicon. While living in Mainz Salfeld received many honors. The first of these was a Knights' Cross first class and induction into the order of Philipp des Großmütigen in 1905, after he had been a rabbi in the city for twenty-five years. In 1912, when the new Mainz synagogue was dedicated, the Archduke Ernst Ludwig conferred upon Salfeld the title of professor. During World War I both Siegmund and Zipporah earned certificates of honor (Ehrenzeichen) for their assistance with the war effort, and Siegmund received another Knights' Cross first class. Siegmund Salfeld died in May 1926 in Mainz, when he was 84 years old. digitize...|$|R
