40|$|This paper {{describes}} work {{in progress}} on <b>computer</b> <b>modeling</b> of speech acquisition. In these tests, a <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> is presented with natural speech to examine whether the model can learn vowel categories. Preliminary results are promising. The computer learns a threevowel and a five-vowel system from consonant vowel syllables in isolation. However, the experiments show that clear input is crucial for learning categories and that the most frequent variety of speech, rapid casual speech, does not provide such a signal. We propose that motherese, the speech register that parents use for addressing their children, can provide such an input. The usefulness of motherese in learning vowel categories can be tested with the <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> using existing recordings of motherese and adult-to-adult speech. <b>Computer</b> <b>modeling</b> of this type is compared with speech recognition systems. 1...|$|R
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the floods, the NWS utilized enhanced radar technology and <b>computer</b> <b>models</b> to better forecast flood events, {{as well as}} improved communications. Whereas in 1985, three different NWS agencies issued different warnings for the area affected in southwest Virginia, the NWS has since restructured to allow local offices, {{such as the one}} in Roanoke, to directly issue watches and warnings. The NWS also implemented increased flood prediction techniques across West Virginia in the years after the floods. As many West Virginia counties lacked a full-time emergency management director at the time, funding from the NWS provided 24‑hour weather radios for every county by the year 1987.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days prior}} to Fabian {{striking}} Bermuda, <b>computer</b> <b>models</b> forecast a ridge of high pressure forcing the hurricane {{to the west of}} the island by 200miles (320km). Not expected to be a direct threat, a meteorologist at the Bermuda Weather Service expected gusty winds and potentially heavy rainfall. Each successive advisory brought the hurricane steadily closer to Bermuda, and 35hours before Fabian made its closest approach, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a hurricane watch for the island. When a track near Bermuda became more certain, a hurricane warning was issued for the island, approximately 29hours before Fabian made a direct hit on the island.|$|E
5|$|Simulating the geodynamo {{requires}} numerically {{solving a}} set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of the Earth's interior. Simulation of the MHD equations is performed on a 3D grid of points and the fineness of the grid, which in part determines the realism of the solutions, is limited mainly by computer power. For decades, theorists were confined to creating kinematic dynamo <b>computer</b> <b>models</b> in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and {{the effect on the}} magnetic field calculated. Kinematic dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries and testing whether such geometries could sustain a dynamo.|$|E

In the days preceding the event, a cyclone over eastern Canada circulated cold air southward. <b>Computer</b> <b>models</b> indicated the potential for a major storm up to seven days in advance; however, initially, certain forecasts suggested that a separate storm over the southern U.S. would merge with the clipper.

5|$|When {{the motion}} of Juliette turned to the northeast, some <b>computer</b> <b>models</b> {{predicted}} it to continue northeastward and strike Baja California Sur.

Juliette remained away from land masses for its lifetime, {{and as a result}} there were no reports of damage or deaths. In southern California, however, the hurricane produced high waves that created dangerous surfing conditions. These waves wiped out a fishing derby.
