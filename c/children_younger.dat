5|$|Rotavirus A, which {{accounts}} for more than 90% of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans, is endemic worldwide. Each year rotavirus causes millions of cases of diarrhoea in developing countries, almost 2million of which result in hospitalisation. In 2013, an estimated 215,000 <b>children</b> <b>younger</b> than five died from rotavirus, 90 percent of whom were in developing countries. Almost every child has been infected with rotavirus by age five. Rotavirus is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, is responsible for {{about a third of the}} cases requiring hospitalisation, and causes 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in <b>children</b> <b>younger</b> than five. Boys are twice as likely as girls to be admitted to hospital for rotavirus.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of those}} who died (comprising 78% of the {{fugitive}} victims) were young men aged between 16 and 30. Married men accounted for 20% of the deaths while only 8 (6%) were women. Nine <b>children</b> <b>younger</b> than 16 years old died, whereas 94 victims were aged between 21 and 30. The overwhelming majority came from East Berlin and the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} in 2006 that suicide {{was one of the}} top causes of death of Singapore youths. In 2001, five <b>children</b> <b>younger</b> than 15 years took their lives, and 37 people between the ages of 15 and 25 did so. The coroner's report of a junior college student who killed himself because he believed his penis was too small {{was reported}} in the international media. The pressure exerted by parents on their children to produce good academic results has also been a contributing factor in some suicides.|$|E

5000|$|The green paper {{prompted}} {{a debate about}} services for <b>children,</b> <b>young</b> people and families resulting in a consultation with those working in children's services, and with parents, <b>children</b> and <b>young</b> people. The Government published Every Child Matters: the Next Steps in November 2004, and passed the Children Act 2004, providing the legislative spine for developing more effective and accessible services focused around the needs of <b>children,</b> <b>young</b> people and families.|$|R
5|$|Medical {{complications}} {{are associated}} with a bad prognosis. Examples are hypotension (low blood pressure), hypoxia (low blood oxygen saturation), lower cerebral perfusion pressures and longer times spent with high intracranial pressures. Patient characteristics also influence prognosis. Factors thought to worsen it include abuse of substances such as illicit drugs and alcohol and age over sixty or under two years (in <b>children,</b> <b>younger</b> age at time of injury may be associated with a slower recovery of some abilities). Other influences that may affect recovery include pre-injury intellectual ability, coping strategies, personality traits, family environment, social support systems and financial circumstances.|$|E
5|$|One month later, the House of Lords {{passed the}} Slavery Abolition Act, which {{abolished}} slavery {{in most of}} the British Empire from August 1834. They voted plantation owners £20million in compensation, giving full emancipation to <b>children</b> <b>younger</b> than six, and instituting a system of apprenticeship requiring other enslaved peoples to work for their former masters for four to six years in the British West Indies, South Africa, Mauritius, British Honduras and Canada. Nearly 800,000 African slaves were freed, the vast majority in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the free}} {{population}} 23.4% {{of males and}} 13.4% of females were considered literate. Men represented 52% (5,123,869) of the total population. Figures for the population by age showed 24.6% were <b>children</b> <b>younger</b> than 10 years old; 21.1% were adolescents and young men between 11 and 20; 32.9% were adults between 21 and 40; 8.4% were between 41 and 50; 12.8% were between 51 and 70; and lastly, only 3.4% were over 71. The residents in the combined northeast and southeast regions comprised 87.2% of the nation's population. The second national census was held in 1890 when the Brazilian republic {{was only a few}} months old. Its results showed that the population had grown to 14,333,915 inhabitants since the 1872 census.|$|E

40|$|The Internet {{has become}} a popular {{communication}} tool for, and about, <b>children</b> and <b>young</b> people. Many <b>children</b> and <b>young</b> people participate in social networking websites and blogs, and develop their own web pages. Community organisations and businesses, such as sporting groups, involved with <b>children</b> and <b>young</b> people also use the Internet to promote activities and services. These Internet communication activities can include photos or visual recordings of <b>children</b> and <b>young</b> people. This Resource Sheet provides information about safety and good practice when images of <b>children</b> and <b>young</b> people are displayed online. The display of images of <b>children</b> and <b>young</b> people on the Internet requires careful considerations.

5|$|Antibody {{tests in}} <b>children</b> <b>younger</b> than 18months are {{typically}} inaccurate {{due to the}} continued presence of maternal antibodies. Thus HIV infection can only be diagnosed by PCR testing for HIV RNA or DNA, or via testing for the p24 antigen. Much of the world lacks access to reliable PCR testing and many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is old enough for accurate antibody testing. In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2007–2009 between 30 and 70% of the population were aware of their HIV status. In 2009, between 3.6 and 42% {{of men and women}} in Sub-Saharan countries were tested which represented a significant increase compared to previous years.|$|E
5|$|In the A-not-B task, {{children}} are shown an object hidden at Location A within their reach, and are then prompted {{to search for}} the object at Location A, where they find it. This activity is repeated several times, with the hidden object at Location A. Then, in the critical trial, the object is hidden in Location B, a second location within easy reach of child. Typically, <b>children</b> <b>younger</b> than one year old search for the object under Location A, where the object was previously hidden. However, after their first birthday, {{children are}} capable of mentally switching to locate the object in Location B, demonstrating flexibility. Researchers have agreed that the A-not-B task is a simple task that effectively measures cognitive flexibility during infancy.|$|E
5|$|The overall case-fatality {{rate for}} ordinary-type {{smallpox}} is about 30 percent, but varies by pock distribution: ordinary type-confluent is fatal about 50–75 {{percent of the}} time, ordinary-type semi-confluent about 25–50 percent of the time, {{in cases where the}} rash is discrete the case-fatality rate is less than 10 percent. The overall fatality rate for <b>children</b> <b>younger</b> than 1 year of age is 40–50 percent. Hemorrhagic and flat types have the highest fatality rates. The fatality rate for flat-type is 90 percent or greater and nearly 100 percent is observed in cases of hemorrhagic smallpox. The case-fatality rate for variola minor is 1 percent or less. There is no evidence of chronic or recurrent infection with variola virus.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Auschwitz, the SS {{forcibly}} separated {{the men from}} the women and children, and Otto Frank was wrenched from his family. Those deemed able to work were admitted into the camp, and those deemed unfit for labour were immediately killed. Of the 1,019 passengers, 549—including all <b>children</b> <b>younger</b> than 15—were sent directly to the gas chambers. Anne Frank, who had turned 15 three months earlier, was one of the youngest people spared from her transport. She was soon made aware that most people were gassed upon arrival and never learned that the entire group from the Achterhuis had survived this selection. She reasoned that her father, in his mid-fifties and not particularly robust, had been killed immediately after they were separated.|$|E
