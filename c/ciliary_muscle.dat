5|$|Some {{cases of}} {{nearsightedness}} {{are recognized as}} due to a transient spasm of the <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscle,</b> rather than a misshapen eyeball. These are classed as pseudomyopia, of which spontaneous reversal may account for some reports of improvement.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown that the human eyeball is far too rigid to spontaneously change shape to a degree that would be {{necessary}} to accomplish what Bates described. Exceedingly small changes in axial length of the eyeball (18.6–19.2 micrometres) are caused by the action of the <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscle</b> during accommodation. However, these changes are far too small to account for the necessary changes in focus, producing changes of only −0.036 dioptres.|$|E

When the <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscles</b> contract the lamina vitrea puts pressure on the vitreous, so that the anterior chamber becomes narrow, and aquious outflow is improved. 3. When the <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscles</b> contract, the <b>ciliary</b> body becomes congestiv and the aquious humor is more produced. 4.

5000|$|Accommodation : This is an oculomotor cue for depth perception. When we try {{to focus}} on far away objects, the <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscles</b> stretch the eye lens, making it thinner, and hence {{changing}} the focal length.

Accommodation is only effective for distances less than 2 meters.|$|R
25|$|Treatment of corneal ulcers {{includes}} topical {{antibiotic therapy}} to prevent infection, and pain medications, including topical atropine to stop spasms of the <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscle.</b> Atropine may decrease tear production and interfere with corneal healing. Superficial ulcers usually heal {{in less than}} a week. Deep ulcers and descemetoceles may require corneal suturing, conjunctival grafts or conjunctival flaps, soft contact lenses, or corneal transplant. Topical corticosteroids and anesthetics should not be used on any type of corneal ulcer because they prevent healing and will often make them worse.|$|E
25|$|Atropine is a enantiomeric {{mixture of}} d-hyoscyamine and l-hyoscyamine, {{with most of}} its {{physiological}} effects due to l-hyoscyamine. Its pharmacological effects are due to binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. It is an antimuscarinic agent. Significant levels are achieved in the CNS within 30 minutes to 1 hour and disappears rapidly from the blood with a half-life of 2 hours. About 60% is excreted unchanged in the urine, {{most of the rest}} appears in urine as hydrolysis and conjugation products. Effects on the iris and <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscle</b> may persist for longer than 72 hours.|$|E
500|$|Accommodation is {{the process}} by which the eye {{increases}} optical power to maintain focus on the retina while shifting its gaze to a closer point. The long-standing medical consensus is that this is accomplished by action of the <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscle,</b> a muscle within the eye, which adjusts the curvature of the eye's crystalline lens. This explanation is based in the observed effect of atropine temporarily preventing accommodation when applied to the <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscle,</b> as well as images reflected on the crystalline lens becoming smaller as the eye shifts focus to a closer point, indicating a change in the lens' shape. Bates rejected this explanation, and in his 1920 book presented photographs that he said showed that the image remained the same size even as the eye shifted focus, concluding from this that the lens was not a factor in accommodation. However, optometrist Philip Pollack in a 1956 work characterized these photographs as [...] "so blurred {{that it is impossible to}} tell whether one image is larger than the other", in contrast to later photographs that clearly showed a change in the size of the reflected images, just as had been observed since the late nineteenth century.|$|E

60|$|Section 111. The eye (Figure 8) has a tough, dense, outer coat, the {{sclerotic}} (sc.), {{within which}} is a highly vascular and internally pigmented layer, the choroid, upon which the percipient nervous layer, the retina (r.) rests. The chief chamber of the eye is filled with a transparent jelly, the vitreous humour (v.h.). In front of the eye, the white sclerotic passes into the transparent cornea (c.). The epidermis is continued over the outer face {{of this as a}} thin, transparent epithelium. The choroid coat is continued in front by a ring-shaped muscle, the iris (ir.) the coloured portion of the eyes. This iris enlarges or contracts its central aperture (the black pupil) by reflex action, as the amount of light diminishes or increases. Immediately behind this curtain is the crystalline lens (l.), the curvature of the anterior face or which is controlled by the <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscle</b> (c.m.). In front of the lens is the aqueous humour (a.h.). The description of the action of this apparatus involves the explanation of several of the elementary principles of optics, and will be found by the student in any text-book of that subject. Here it would have no very instructive bearing, either on general physiological considerations or upon anatomical fact.|$|E
60|$|The {{heart was}} {{situated}} deep in just {{back of the}} gills. It was a big organ, exceedingly heavy, and the most muscular tissue I ever saw. In fact, so powerfully muscular was it that when cut the tissue contracted {{and could not be}} placed together again. The valves were likewise remarkably well developed and strong. This wonderful heart accounted for the wonderful vitality of the swordfish. The eyes of a swordfish likewise proved the wonder of nature. They were huge and prominent, a deep sea-blue set in pale crystal rims and black circles. A swordfish could revolve his eyes and turn them in their sockets so that they were absolutely protected in battle with his mates and rivals. The eye had a covering of bone, cup-shaped, and it was this bone that afforded protection. It was evident that when the eye was completely turned in the swordfish could not see at all. Probably this was for close battle. The muscles were very heavy and strong, one attached at the rim of the eye and the other farther back. The optic nerve was as large as the median nerve of a man's arm--that is to say, half the size of a lead-pencil. There were three coverings over the fluid that held the pupil. And these were as thick and tough as isinglass. Most remarkable of all was the <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscle</b> which held the capacity of contracting the lens for distant vision. A swordfish could see as far as the rays of light penetrated in whatever depth he swam. I have always suspected he had extraordinary eyesight, and this dissection of the eye proved it. No fear a swordfish will not see a bait! He can see the boat and the bait a long distance.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscle</b> {{of the eye}} {{functions}} to round the lens for accommodation and is controlled mainly by parasympathetic system input.

40|$|AIM:To seek a small interfering RNA(siRNA) {{sequence}} targeting rat inhibitor {{of nuclear}} factor kappa B α(IκBα) that can specifically and effectively suppress IκBα mRNA expression of rat <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscles</b> in vivo. METHODS:Three IκBα specific double stranded siRNAs were designed and synthesized. They were transfected into rat A 7 r 5 cells which express IκBα gene. Flow cytometry {{was used to}} assess transfected efficiency. The mRNA and protein levels of IκBα were examined by Real Time quantitative polymerase chain reaction(Real Time-PCR) and western blot to screen a candidate valid sequence with the highest inhibitory rate. The Cy 3 labeled non-specific control siRNA or the candidate valid siRNA was then injected into rat anterior chamber. Distribution of Cy 3 -siRNA in rat <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscles</b> was viewed by fluorescence microscopy, and the inhibitory effect in vivo of the valid siRNA was identified via Real Time-PCR and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: The suppression effect of the siRNA targeting the CTACGATGACTGTGTGTTT of IκBα gene was most obvious by vitro screening. By anterior chamber injection, this valid siRNA could reach rat <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscles</b> and effectively suppress IκBα gene expression with the highest inhibitory rate of 59. 0 % on mRNA level at 24 h after RNAi, and 52. 3 % on protein level at 72 h after RNAi(P CONCLUSION: It proves that the siRNA targeting the CTACGATGACTGTGTGTTT of IκBα gene is the valid sequence to suppress rat IκBα expression of <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscles</b> by RNAi in vivo...|$|R

To further understand {{the mechanism of}} its action binding sites for prostaglandin F 2 alpha and, for comparison, prostaglandin E 2 were localised in sections of human cadaveric eyes using an in vitro ligand-binding technique and autoradiography. Specific binding sites for both prostaglandin F 2 alpha and E 2 were co-localised {{at a high level}} in the areas of the <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscles</b> and iris sphincter muscles, and at a lower level in the iris epithelium and the retina.

50|$|During accommodation, {{the pupil}} constricts to {{increase}} the depth of focus of the eye by blocking the light scattered by {{the periphery of the}} cornea. The lens then increases its curvature to become more biconvex, thus increasing refractive power. The <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscles</b> are responsible for the lens accommodation response.|$|R
50|$|The {{accommodation}} reflex (or accommodation-convergence reflex) is {{a reflex}} {{action of the}} eye, in response to focusing on a near object, then looking at distant object (and vice versa), comprising coordinated changes in vergence, lens shape and pupil size (accommodation). It is dependent on cranial nerve II (afferent limb of reflex), superior centers (interneuron) and cranial nerve III (efferent limb of reflex). The change {{in the shape of}} the lens is controlled by the <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscles</b> inside the eye. Changes in contraction of the <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscles</b> alter the focal distance of the eye, causing nearer or farther images to come into focus on the retina; this process is known as accommodation. The reflex, controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system, involves three responses; pupil accommodation, lens accommodation, and convergence.|$|R

2500|$|In the eye, {{atropine}} induces mydriasis {{by blocking}} contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle, which is normally stimulated by acetylcholine release, thereby allowing the radial pupillary dilator muscle to contract and dilate the pupil.

5000|$|A {{spasm of}} {{accommodation}} (also {{known as an}} accommodation, or accommodative spasm) is {{a condition in which}} the <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscle</b> of the eye remains {{in a constant state of}} contraction. Normal accommodation allows the eye to [...] "accommodate" [...] for near-vision. However in a state of perpetual contraction, the <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscle</b> cannot relax when viewing distant objects. This causes vision to blur when attempting to view objects from a distance.

500|$|A 1952 study {{involving}} 100 subjects {{claiming to}} experience [...] "flashes" [...] of clear vision, in which eyesight momentarily becomes much sharper, found only one subject who [...] "demonstrated unusually good transient acuity (a flash) {{but she was}} unable to maintain it or repeat it for measurement of refraction" [...] and concluded that [...] "'flashers' (those who can obtain remarkably large transient increases in visual acuity) are uncommon".

5000|$|Changing the {{curvature}} of the lens is {{carried out by the}} <b>ciliary</b> <b>muscles</b> surrounding the lens; this process is called [...] "accommodation". Accommodation narrows the inner diameter of the ciliary body, which actually relaxes the fibers of the suspensory ligament attached to the periphery of the lens, and allows the lens to relax into a more convex, or globular, shape. A more convex lens refracts light more strongly and focuses divergent light rays from near objects onto the retina, allowing closer objects to be brought into better focus.|$|R
