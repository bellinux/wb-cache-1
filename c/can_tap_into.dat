5|$|Tim Schafer, the game's {{creative}} director, {{was inspired}} to create the game by his own past musical experiences. The game features the character of Eddie Riggs, voiced by and modeled after Jack Black, a roadie who is transported to a fantasy world inspired by the artwork of heavy metal album covers. Eddie becomes the world's savior, leading the down-trodden humans against a range of supernatural overlords using a battle axe, his Flying V guitar that <b>can</b> <b>tap</b> <b>into</b> the magical powers of the world, and a customizable hot rod.|$|E
500|$|Keith Caulfield from Billboard, while {{reviewing}} Confessions on a Dance Floor, {{called the}} song [...] "a fluffier cut". Chris Tucker from Billboard explained that [...] "Madonna {{returns with a}} song that will restore faith among her minions, fans of pop music and radio programmers". Jon Pareles of The New York Times said that Madonna kept her pop touch in [...] "Hung Up" [...] and called it a love song which is both happy as well as sad. Alan Light from Rolling Stone called the song candy coated. David Browne from Entertainment Weekly {{was impressed by the}} song and said [...] "'Hung Up' shows how effortlessly she [...] <b>can</b> <b>tap</b> <b>into</b> her petulant inner teen". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine compared the song to the remix of Gwen Stefani's 2004 single [...] "What You Waiting For?". Ed Gonzalez from the same magazine called the song the biggest hit of her career. Margaret Moser from The Austin Chronicle said that the song strobes and pulses along with another album track [...] "Forbidden Love". Peter Robinson from The Guardian commented that [...] "Hung Up" [...] is Madonna's [...] "most wonderfully commercial single since the mid Eighties". Alexis Petridis from The Guardian said that the song could have been more campy by addition of Liza Minnelli inspired vocals in the background and lyrics which talk about Larry Grayson.|$|E
2500|$|ABC {{executive}} producer Julie Hanan Carruthers later explained {{in an interview}} what the writers were going for with the storyline. Carruthers said, [...] "When Megan [...] {{came up with this}} whole concept, it was about, 'How do we emotionally impact [...] all the people we care about?' And obviously high stakes, and life-or-death stakes, really raise the bar of emotion. When you <b>can</b> <b>tap</b> <b>into</b> the personal relationships and the love and the caring and also the hopes and fears of all these people we've invested so much time and support in, you have compelling storytelling." ...|$|E

2500|$|People tend to {{experience}} their reality as stressful, according to HR, {{when they are}} having insecure or negative thoughts. But HR suggests that such thoughts {{do not have to}} be taken seriously. When one chooses to take them more lightly, according to HR, the mind quiets down and positive feelings emerge spontaneously. Thus, HR also teaches that people have health and well-being already within them (in HR this is known as [...] "innate health"), ready to emerge as soon as their troubled thinking calms down. When this happens, according to HR, people also gain access to common sense, and they <b>can</b> <b>tap</b> <b>into</b> the universal capacity for creative problem solving or [...] "inner wisdom." [...] Anecdotal reports suggest that, when a person grasps the understanding behind HR in an experiential way, an expansive sense of emotional freedom and well-being can result.|$|E
2500|$|The {{title is}} taken from the game's main premise – that {{industrial}} espionage runs rampant in a near-future setting. [...] A shadowrun – a successful data theft or physical break-in at a rival corporation or organization – {{is one of the}} main tools employed by both corporate rivals and underworld figures. [...] Deckers (futuristic hackers) who <b>can</b> <b>tap</b> <b>into</b> an immersive, three-dimensional cyberspace are opposed by rival deckers and lethal, potentially brain-destroying artificial intelligences called [...] "Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics" [...] – [...] "ICE" [...] for short –, who are protected by street fighters and/or mercenaries, often with cyborg implants (called cyberware), magicians, and other exotic figures, on such missions as they seek access, physical or remote, to the power structures of rival groups. [...] Magic has also returned to the world after a series of dystopian plagues; [...] dragons who can take human form have returned as well, and are commonly found in high positions of corporate power.|$|E
2500|$|Millennia {{later in}} Dune, the Bene Gesserit base {{of power is}} the Mother School on the planet Wallach IX, whose {{graduates}} are fit mates for Emperors, and whose specially trained Truthsayers can detect falsehood. But beyond the outer virtues of poise, self-control, and diplomacy, Bene Gesserit training includes superior combat skills and precise physiological control that grants them direct control over conception and embryotic sex determination, ageing, and even the ability to render poisons harmless within their bodies. The Bene Gesserit power of Voice allows them to control others by merely modulating their vocal tones. Sisters who survive a ritualized poisoning known as the spice agony achieve increased awareness and abilities through access to Other Memory, and are subsequently known as Reverend Mothers. Every member of the Bene Gesserit is conditioned into singular loyalty to the order and its goals with allegiances to even family being secondary, and no goal is more paramount than the Sisterhood's large-scale breeding program. It aims to create a superbeing that <b>can</b> <b>tap</b> <b>into</b> abilities even the Bene Gesserit cannot, a being whom they can use {{in order to gain}} more direct control over the universe. To this end, the Bene Gesserit have subtly manipulated bloodlines for generations, using breeding sisters to [...] "collect" [...] the genes they require.|$|E

2500|$|Excavations may {{be simple}} {{depressions}} dug {{up in the}} substrate, such as the nests of bowfin, smallmouth bass, and Pacific salmon, {{but it can also}} consist of fairly large burrows used for shelter and for nesting. Burrowing species include the mudskippers, the red band-fish Cepola rubescens (burrows up to 1 m deep, often with a side branch), the yellowhead jawfish Opistognathus aurifrons (chambers up to 22cm deep, lined with coral fragments to solidify it), the convict blenny Pholidichthys leucotaenia [...] whose burrow is a maze of tunnels and chambers thought to be as much as 6 m long, and the Nicaragua cichlid, Hypsophrys nicaraguensis, who drills a tunnel by spinning inside of it. [...] In the case of the mudskippers, the burrows are shaped like a J and can be as much as 2 m deep. Two species, the giant mudskipper Periophthalmodon schlosseri and the walking goby Scartelaos histophorus, build a special chamber at the bottom of their burrows into which they carry mouthfuls of air. Once released the air accumulates {{at the top of the}} chamber and forms a reserve from which the fish can breathe – like all amphibious fishes, mudskippers are good air breathers. If researchers experimentally extract air from the special chambers, the fish diligently replenish it. The significance of this behaviour stems from the facts that at high tide, when water covers the mudflats, the fish stay in their burrow to avoid predators, and water inside the confined burrow is often poorly oxygenated. At such times these air-breathing fishes <b>can</b> <b>tap</b> <b>into</b> the air reserve of their special chambers.|$|E
