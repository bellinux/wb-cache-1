It has similar effect to lead and improves the <b>chip</b> <b>breaking</b> during machining. The shrinking on solidification in lead {{and the expansion of}} bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} {{numerical control}} (CNC) machine tools a process called , or interrupted cut drilling, is used to keep swarf from detrimentally building up when drilling deep holes (approximately when {{the depth of the}} hole is three times greater than the drill diameter). Peck drilling involves plunging the drill part way through the workpiece, no more than five times the diameter of the drill, and then retracting it to the surface. This is repeated until the hole is finished. A modified form of this process, called high speed peck drilling or <b>chip</b> <b>breaking,</b> only retracts the drill slightly. This process is faster, but is only used in moderately long holes, otherwise it will overheat the drill bit. It is also used when drilling stringy material to break the chips.|$|E

At a family dinner, Bill volunteers to buy the fireworks for the 'club picnic' where his father-in-law intends to announce that he is running for Mayor. After a fun-filled day, Bill invites the Kid, Lucy, and her friend back to the tent he has set up in his brother's back yard, where he gets very high and has meaningless sex with Lucy's friend. Bill attends the picnic at the golf course. At the picnic, Bill gets too close to his wife and <b>Chip,</b> <b>breaking</b> Chip's restraining order. Chip then promptly has security throw him out of the picnic, which the Whitmans witness. Bill tells the Kid to meet him at the back entrance, and while driving his car {{to the back of the}} golf course, he gets into a car accident, causing the fireworks to explode early. The Kid comes to his rescue on a golfing cart, takes Bill to the hospital, where Jess shows up, and tells her husband that she's aware of his attempt to purchase the franchise.

For drilling the fastening holes, the processes of Vibration Assisted Drilling (VAD) expand rapidly, as it permits to improve reliability of drilling operations on multilayer structures.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the activities of}} the research project entitled {open_quotes}Study of <b>Chip</b> <b>Breaking</b> Mechanisms in Orthogonal Cutting{close_quotes}. The research effort took place from April 1990 to June 1991. The overall objective of the project was to develop a systematic procedure for gaining a more fundamental understanding of <b>chip</b> <b>breaking</b> mechanics. Central to this objective is a computer model that can simulate chip formation in orthogonal cutting. This model has been under development {{for the past seven years}} at NCSU. The model is based on an Eulerian formulation of the finite element technique. The model simulates the cutting process for various tool geometries over a wide range of cutting conditions. The model can be used to predict chip geometry, cutting forces, plastic strains, strain rates, and temperatures in the workpiece and chip, as well as temperatures in the tool itself. Of particular significance is that specific tool geometries can be simulated. Therefore, the model can be used to systematically evaluate the strains, strain rates, temperature, and geometry of the chip as a function of a specific chip-breaker tool design. These results can provide the crucial information necessary to formulate a fundamental understanding of the <b>chip</b> <b>breaking</b> mechanism over a wide range of operating conditions and workpiece materials...|$|E
