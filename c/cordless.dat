5|$|There {{were three}} {{telephones}} {{at the farm}} on the night, {{all on the same}} landline. There was usually a <b>cordless</b> phone with a memory-recall feature in the kitchen; a beige digital phone, also kept in the kitchen; and a cream rotary phone in the main bedroom. (There was normally a fourth phone too, a blue digital phone in the first-floor office, but it had been sent for repairs on 5 August.) The rotary phone had at some point been moved out of the bedroom and into the kitchen, where the police found it after the murders with its receiver off the hook. They found the beige digital phone under a pile of magazines in the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|NYU has 470,000 living alumni as of 2015. At least 37 Nobel Prize {{winners are}} {{affiliated}} with NYU. NYU {{is associated with}} a great number of important inventions and discoveries. For example, cardiac defibrillator and artificial cardiac pacemaker (Barouh Berkovits), closed-chest cardiac defibrillator (William B. Kouwenhoven), laser (Gordon Gould), atom bomb (Frederick Reines), polio vaccine (Albert Sabin), RFID (Mario Cardullo), telephone handset (Robert G. Brown), wireless microphone (Hung-Chang Lin), first digital image scanner (Russell A. Kirsch), television (Benjamin Adler), light beer (Joseph Owades), non-stick cookware (John Gilbert), black hole thermodynamics (Jacob Bekenstein), polymer science (Herman Francis Mark), microwave (Ernst Weber), X-ray crystallography (Paul Peter Ewald), barcode (Jerome Swartz), structure of the DNA (Francis Crick), tau lepton (Martin Lewis Perl), processes for creating food coloring, decaffeination and sugar substitute (Torunn Atteraas Garin), processes for the mass production of penicillin (Jasper H. Kane), X-ray generator and rotational radiation therapy (John G. Trump), nuclear reactor and hydrogen bomb (John Archibald Wheeler), and contact lenses (Norman Gaylord), among many others. Alumnus Fred Waller who invented Cinerama and the Waller Gunnery Trainer, also obtained the first patent for a water ski. The first patents for touch screen cash machine (Richard J. Orford), and zoom lens (Leonard Bergstein), were also obtained by NYU alumni. Some of the most prolific inventors in American history are NYU alumni, for example Jerome H. Lemelson whose 605 patents involved the <b>cordless</b> telephone, fax machine, videocassette recorder and camcorder, among others; Samuel Ruben whose inventions include electric battery; James Wood who invented cable-lift elevator, fabricated the steel cables for the Brooklyn Bridge and contributed to the development of lockmaking, submarine, electric generator, electric motor, transformer and the design of the refrigerator; and Albert Macovski whose innovations include the single-tube color camera and real-time phased array imaging for ultrasound. NYU is the birthplace of the tractor beam and 5G. Before and during World War II, NYU's Tandon School of Engineering worked on problems whose solution {{led to the development of}} radar, and later broke ground in electromagnetic theory, electronics in general, and solved re-entry problems of the manned space capsules, as well as helped develop and design the NASDAQ Automated Quote System and trading floors. Developer of the early telephone systems in the United States Bancroft Gherardi Jr., developer of the submarine communications facilities Jack M. Sipress, inventor of Italy's first computer Mario Tchou, designer of the Panama Canal locks Henry C. Goldmark, designer of the Pentagon Hugh John Casey, designer of the Apollo Lunar Module Thomas J. Kelly, as well as the designer of virtually every major bridge in New York City from the George Washington to the Verrazano, Leopold Just, are also NYU alumni.|$|E
25|$|An {{optional}} Bluetooth-based <b>cordless</b> {{version of}} the Apple Mouse in white, released in 2003 was Apple's first <b>cordless</b> mouse. Combined with internal Bluetooth interfaces in new Macs, this bypassed their wired relatives' aberrantly short cords to once again make Apple's mouses usable for left-handed laptop owners.|$|E
25|$|A <b>cordless</b> {{telephone}} is {{a telephone}} with a wireless handset that communicates via radio waves with a base station {{connected to a}} fixed telephone line, usually within a limited range of its base station. The base station is on the subscriber premises, and attaches to the telephone network {{the same way a}} corded telephone does. In 1965, an American woman named Teri Pall invented the <b>cordless</b> telephone. Due to difficulties of marketing, Pall never patented her invention. George Sweigert of Euclid, Ohio had more success, thus receiving a patent for the <b>cordless</b> telephone in 1969.|$|E
25|$|To {{transmit}} their input, typical cabled mice use a thin {{electrical cord}} terminating {{in a standard}} connector, such as RS-232C, PS/2, ADB or USB. <b>Cordless</b> mice instead transmit data via infrared radiation (see IrDA) or radio (including Bluetooth), although many such <b>cordless</b> interfaces are themselves connected through the aforementioned wired serial buses.|$|E
25|$|A {{nickel-zinc battery}} {{is a type}} of {{rechargeable}} battery that may be used in <b>cordless</b> power tools, <b>cordless</b> telephone, digital cameras, battery operated lawn and garden tools, professional photography, flashlights, electric bike, and light electric vehicle sectors. In 1900, Thomas Alva Edison filed U.S. Patent #684,204 for the nickel-zinc battery. It was issued on October 8, 1901.|$|E
25|$|On 21 March 2007, the Telecommunications Industry Association {{issued the}} TIA-1083 standard, which gives {{manufacturers}} of <b>cordless</b> telephones {{the ability to}} test their products for compatibility with most hearing aids that have a T-Coil magnetic coupling mode. With this testing, digital <b>cordless</b> phone manufacturers {{will be able to}} inform consumers about which products will work with their hearing aids.|$|E
25|$|Headphones may be {{used with}} {{stationary}} CD and DVD players, home theater, personal computers, or portable devices (e.g., digital audio player/MP3 player, mobile phone). <b>Cordless</b> headphones are not connected to their source by a cable. Instead, they receive a radio or infrared signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link, such as FM, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. These are powered receiver systems, of which the headphone is only a component. <b>Cordless</b> headphones are used with events such as a Silent disco or Silent Gig.|$|E
25|$|A <b>cordless</b> {{electric}} screwdriver with supercapacitors for energy storage has {{about half the}} run time of a comparable battery model, but can be fully charged in 90 seconds. It retains 85% of its charge after three months left idle.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{accessories}} for {{the console}} have been developed. These accessories include the wireless Sixaxis and DualShock 3 controllers, the Logitech Driving Force GT, the Logitech <b>Cordless</b> Precision Controller, the BD Remote, the PlayStation Eye camera, and the PlayTV DVB-T tuner/digital video recorder accessory.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cordless</b> or {{wireless}} mice transmit data via {{infrared radiation}} (see IrDA) or radio (including Bluetooth and Wi-Fi). The receiver {{is connected to}} the computer through a serial or USB port, or can be built in (as is sometimes the case with Bluetooth and WiFi).|$|E
25|$|Note that {{telecoil}} coupling {{has nothing}} to do with the radio signal in a cellular or <b>cordless</b> phone: the audio signal picked up by the telecoil is the weak electromagnetic field that is generated by the voice coil in the phone's speaker as it pushes the speaker cone back and forth.|$|E
25|$|Cisco {{became a}} major {{provider}} of Voice over IP to enterprises and is now moving into the home user market through its acquisitions of Scientific Atlanta and Linksys. Scientific Atlanta provides VoIP equipment to cable service providers such as Time Warner, Cablevision, Rogers Communications, UPC and others; Linksys has partnered with companies such as Skype, Microsoft and Yahoo! to integrate consumer VoIP services with wireless and <b>cordless</b> phones.|$|E
25|$|Usually <b>cordless,</b> {{they often}} have a switch to {{deactivate}} the movement circuitry between use, allowing the user freedom of movement without affecting the cursor position. A patent for an inertial mouse claims that such mice consume less power than optically based mice, and offer increased sensitivity, reduced weight and increased ease-of-use. In combination with a wireless keyboard an inertial mouse can offer alternative ergonomic arrangements which do not require a flat work surface, potentially alleviating some types of repetitive motion injuries related to workstation posture.|$|E
25|$|Telephone {{headsets}} {{connect to}} a fixed-line telephone system. A telephone headset functions by replacing the handset of a telephone. Headsets for standard corded telephones are {{fitted with a}} standard 4P4C commonly called an RJ-9 connector. Headsets are also available with 2.5mm jack sockets for many DECT phones and other applications. <b>Cordless</b> bluetooth headsets are available, and often used with mobile telephones. Headsets are widely used for telephone-intensive jobs, in particular by call centre workers. They are also used by anyone wishing to hold telephone conversations with both hands free.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the {{original}} {{meaning of the}} adjective is retained, but the whole compound still means something more specific {{than the sum of}} the elements. For example, savanyú káposzta, lit. ’sour cabbage’, actually ’sauerkraut’, is more than a cabbage that tastes sour: it means a type of pickled food, yet it is written with a space. On the other hand, mobiltelefon ’mobile phone’ is written in one word, although it is actually a telephone that is mobile – writing in one word may be justified by the different technology, as distinguished from a <b>cordless</b> telephone, which is also portable.|$|E
25|$|An 18-hour {{standoff}} ensued {{during which}} time the police talked over the phone to Bryant, still calling himself Jamie. He requested a helicopter, saying {{that he wanted to}} be flown to a plane and then on to Adelaide, South Australia. He said that if the helicopter arrived, he would release Pears and only keep Noelene Martin. Bryant could see the movements of SOG officers, and continually demanded their retreat each time they began to approach the house. As he appeared to have excellent awareness of the events unfurling around him, despite the pitch black of night, the police believed he had some kind of visual aid device; none was ever found, however. A man was spotted on the roof of an adjacent building at one point, believed to be Bryant. Later in the night, the <b>cordless</b> phone Bryant was using began to run low on batteries. Police tried unsuccessfully to get him to return the phone to the charger, but it went dead and there were no further communications.|$|E
500|$|A {{study on}} the non-thermal effects of radio {{frequency}} (RF) on honey bees (Apis mellifera carnica) reported there were no changes in behavior due to RF exposure from DECT <b>cordless</b> phone base stations operating at 1,880–1,900MHz [...] however, a later study established that close-range electromagnetic field (EMF) may reduce the ability of bees {{to return to their}} hive. In the course of their study, one half of their colonies broke down, including some control hives that did not have embedded DECT base stations. In April 2007, news of this study appeared in various media outlets, beginning with an article in The Independent, which stated that the subject of the study included mobile phones and had related them to CCD. Though cellular phones were implicated by other media reports at the time, they were not covered in the study. Researchers involved have since stated that their research did not include findings on cell phones, or their relationship to CCD, and indicated that the Independent article had misinterpreted their results and created [...] "a horror story".|$|E
500|$|The {{stitching}} of {{the binding}} uses [...] "Coptic sewing", that is [...] "flexible unsupported sewing (produced by two needles and thread looping round {{one another in}} a figure-of-eight sewing pattern)" [...] Coptic sewing uses small threads both to attach the leaves together and, knotted together, to attach the pages to the cover boards. Normal Western binding uses thread for the former and thicker cord running across the spine of the book for the latter, with the thread knotted onto the cords. [...] Coptic sewing is also found in the earliest surviving leather bookbindings, which are from Coptic libraries in Egypt from the 7th and 8th centuries; in particular the design of the cover of one in the Morgan Library (MS M.569) has been compared to the St Cuthbert Gospel. [...] In the techniques used in the binding, apart from the raised decoration, the closest resemblance is to an even smaller Irish pocket gospel book from some 50 years later, the Cadmug Gospels at Fulda, which is believed to have belonged to Saint Boniface. [...] This is also in red goatskin, with coloured incised lines, and uses a similar unsupported or <b>cordless</b> stitching technique. [...] The first appearance of the cords or supports that these [...] "unsupported" [...] bindings lack is found in two other books at Fulda, and they soon became universal in, and characteristic of, Western bookbinding until the arrival of modern machine techniques. [...] The cords run horizontally across the spine, and are thicker than the threads that hold the pages together. [...] They are attached, typically by lacing through holes or glue, to the two boards of the cover, and the threads holding the gatherings are knotted to them, resulting in a stronger binding.|$|E
2500|$|A {{hearing aid}} and a {{telephone}} are [...] "compatible" [...] {{when they can}} connect {{to each other in}} a way that produces clear, easily [...] understood sound. The term [...] "compatibility" [...] is applied to all three types of telephones (wired, <b>cordless,</b> and mobile). There are two ways telephones and hearing aids can connect with each other: ...|$|E
2500|$|Candace and Mitchell Aronson, Jewish {{next door}} neighbors of William and Dorothy Quigley, used a Radio Shack police scanner {{to listen in}} on the <b>cordless</b> {{telephone}} conversations of Mr.& Mrs. Quigley. When the Aronsons heard the Quigleys discuss a campaign to drive them from the neighborhood with [...] "Nazi scare tactics", the Aronsons contacted the Denver office of the ADL. Upon {{the advice of the}} ADL, the Aronsons then recorded the Quigley's private telephone conversations. The conversations included discussions of putting pictures of oven doors on the Aronsons' home (a reference to the Holocaust), burning one of the Aronson children, and wishing that the Aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing. (The Quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not anti-Semitic, and were only intended to be sick humor.) Neither the Aronsons nor the ADL were aware that Congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a <b>cordless</b> telephone, to transcribe the material and to use the transcriptions for any purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{workshops}} in residential garages or basements and in light industry contain small or medium-sized bandsaws that can cut wood, metal, or plastic. Often a general-purpose blade {{is left in}} place, although blades optimized for wood or metal can be switched out when volume of use warrants. Most residential and commercial bandsaws are of the vertical type mounted on a bench or a cabinet stand. Portable power tool versions, including <b>cordless</b> models, are also common in recent decades, allowing building contractors to bring them along on the truck to the jobsite.|$|E
2500|$|Summer of 2006 {{brought the}} {{internet}} download project, River of Crime (Episodes 1–5). River of Crime {{was their first}} project with Warner Music Group's <b>Cordless</b> Label. Following the success of that album, the Residents launched their weekly Timmy video project on YouTube. In 2007 they did the soundtrack for the documentary Strange Culture and also released a double instrumental album, Night of the Hunters. On the Fourth of July 2007, the planned October release of its latest project with Mute Records, The Voice of Midnight (a music theater adaptation of E.T.A. Hoffmann's short story [...] "Der Sandmann"), was announced on its Web site.|$|E
2500|$|Inductive {{coupling}} is {{the oldest}} and most widely used wireless power technology, and virtually the only one so far which is used in commercial products. [...] It is used in inductive charging stands for <b>cordless</b> appliances used in wet environments such as electric toothbrushes and shavers, {{to reduce the risk of}} electric shock. Another application area is [...] "transcutaneous" [...] recharging of biomedical prosthetic devices implanted in the human body, such as cardiac pacemakers and insulin pumps, to avoid having wires passing through the skin. [...] It is also used to charge electric vehicles such as cars and to either charge or power transit vehicles like buses and trains.|$|E
2500|$|Normally, any {{intentional}} {{radio transmission}} requires an FCC license pursuant to Title III. [...] However, {{in recent decades}} the FCC has also opened some spectrum bands for unlicensed operations, typically restricting them to low power levels conducive to short-range applications. [...] This has facilitated the development of a very wide range of common technologies from wireless garage door openers, <b>cordless</b> phones, and baby monitors to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth among others. [...] However, unlicensed devices — like most radio transmission equipment — must still receive technical approval from the FCC before being sold into the marketplace, including to ensure that such devices cannot be modified by end users to increase transmit power above FCC limits.|$|E
2500|$|Viglione played drums on Fighting Naked, {{the debut}} album from his {{childhood}} friend Holly Brewer's band, HUMANWINE released through Warner Music Group's <b>Cordless</b> Recordings. Through March and April 2007, he went on a US national tour to support this release. Shortly thereafter, he performed drums for the Nine Inch Nails album, Ghosts I-IV. [...] "Collaborating with Trent on 'Ghosts' was a great experience and he really allowed {{it to be a}} truly creative atmosphere, in having me build a drum kit and allowing me to improvise my drum parts." [...] Around that time, he also wrote, toured, and recorded with various artists including the likes of Jules Shear, Jesse Malin, Martin Bisi, as well as Franz Nicolay/Major General.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{different}} types of propagation are used in practical radio transmission systems. [...] Line-of-sight propagation means radio waves which travel {{in a straight line}} from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. [...] Line of sight transmission is used in short to medium range radio transmission such as cell phones, <b>cordless</b> phones, walkie-talkies, wireless networks, [...] FM radio and television broadcasting and radar, and satellite communication, such as satellite television. [...] Line-of-sight transmission {{on the surface of the}} Earth is limited to the distance to the visual horizon, which depends on the height of transmitting and receiving antennas. [...] It is the only propagation method possible at microwave frequencies and above. [...] At microwave frequencies moisture in the atmosphere (rain fade) can degrade transmission.|$|E
2500|$|Inductive power {{transfer}} between nearby wire coils was the earliest wireless power technology to be developed, existing since the transformer {{was developed in}} the 1800s. [...] Induction heating has been used since the early 1900s. [...] With the advent of <b>cordless</b> devices, induction charging stands have been developed for appliances used in wet environments, like electric toothbrushes and electric razors, to eliminate the hazard of electric shock. [...] One of the earliest proposed applications of inductive transfer was to power electric locomotives. [...] In 1892 Maurice Hutin and Maurice Leblanc patented a wireless method of powering railroad trains using resonant coils inductively coupled to a track wire at 3kHz. [...] The first passive RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technologies were invented by Mario Cardullo (1973) and Koelle et al. (1975) and by the 1990s were being used in proximity cards and contactless smartcards.|$|E
2500|$|Line-of-sight {{refers to}} radio waves which travel {{directly}} {{in a line}} from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. [...] It does not necessarily require a cleared sight path; at lower frequencies radio waves can pass through buildings, foliage and other obstructions. [...] This is the most common propagation mode at VHF and above, and the only possible mode at microwave frequencies and above. [...] On the surface of the Earth, line of sight propagation is limited by the visual horizon to about 40 miles (64 km). [...] This is the method used by cell phones, <b>cordless</b> phones, walkie-talkies, wireless networks, [...] point-to-point microwave radio relay links, [...] FM and television broadcasting and radar. [...] Satellite communication uses longer line-of-sight paths; [...] for example home satellite dishes receive signals from communication satellites 22,000 miles (39,000 km) above the Earth, and ground stations can communicate with spacecraft billions of miles from Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Lower {{power units}} are usually called [...] "hammer drills," [...] {{typically}} have a [...] "cam-action" [...] or [...] "percussion" [...] hammering mechanism, {{in which two}} sets of toothed gears mechanically {{interact with each other}} to hammer while rotating the drill bit. [...] With [...] "cam-action" [...] drills, the chuck has a mechanism whereby the entire chuck and bit move forward and backwards on the axis of rotation, the motion is tied to the rotation of the chuck. This type of drill is often used with and without the hammer action but {{it is not possible to}} use the hammer action alone as it is the rotation over the [...] "cams" [...] which causes the hammer motion. [...] These units are usually smaller and are commonly powered by <b>cordless</b> technology. [...] They are not typically used for production construction drilling, but rather for occasional drilling of concrete or masonry.|$|E
50|$|Skil {{products}} include circular saws, <b>cordless</b> drill/drivers, <b>cordless</b> screw drivers, <b>cordless</b> tackers, <b>cordless</b> sealant guns, belt sanders, random orbit sanders, multi-sanders, angle grinders, hammers, drills, mixers, jig saws, lasers {{and measuring}} tools, reciprocating saws, routers, and planers.|$|E
