50|$|There are {{two major}} types of dies used in flat sheet extrusion: T-shaped and <b>coat-hanger.</b> A T-shaped die {{consists}} of two arms extending at right angles from the initial extrusion channel; these arms have a small slit along their length to allow the polymer melt to flow through. The melt is then further thinned by a short, flat approach before being pushed through the lips of the die.

With the coast clear and the engines changed, Mike heads to his compartment with the baby while Ivan, Patsy, April and Harvey try to find a way out of their crisis. Ivan suggests that they get off at Philadelphia, but Patsy reminds him that they will be rounded up by the police even if they don't stay on the train until New York. At Philadelphia, the suspicious man is met by another two men, who join the train for the last few miles to New York. Back in April's compartment, Patsy, Harvey, April and Ivan are still desperately trying to find a solution to their problem - until Miss Prottle points out that they are all heroes. Harvey and April realise that they needn't have worried about the baby after all; they just have to hand him to the police, and they will be on the front page of every newspaper in the USA. At that moment, Mike comes in and announces that he is going to surrender as soon as they reach New York, to which all eagerly agree. Patsy sends him to get the baby, and Mike, elated when he hears that they will all be received to a hero's welcome, instantly obliges. Shortly after, the guard hands Ivan the contract and a $50,000 cheque for the clinic. Harvey is just signing the contract when Mike bursts back into the room in a panic, saying that the baby has gone. All six of them spread out to look for the baby, whom Mike eventually finds with the suspicious stranger. He approaches him, demanding the baby back, but the other two passengers try to restrain him. Mike, however, is too strong for them, and knocks them down before hanging the suspicious passenger on the <b>coat-hanger.</b> Patsy enters and is about to take the baby when the other two passengers come round and bar her way, only to be overpowered once again by Mike.|$|E

Despite cerebellar ataxia and motor coordination impairments on stationary beam, <b>coat-hanger,</b> and rotorod tests, the horizontal motor activity of Reln-rl-orl mutants was not reduced in an open-field. The elevated cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity in Purkinje cells and the reduced CO activity in the roof nuclei (interpositus and dentate) of the mutants were associated with poor performance on the small stationary beam. In addition, deficient CO activity of the granular layer of the motor cortex was associated with shorter latencies before falling from the larger stationary beam and a lower number of rears in the open-field.

Definition 14. 1. 1 A metric space M is a pair (X, dM) where X is a set and dM: X × X → [0, ∞) is a metric, satisfying the following axioms: (i) dM(x, y) = 0 if and only if x = y, (ii) dM(x, y) = dM(y, x), and (iii) dM(x, y) + dM(y, z) ≥ dM(x, z) (triangle inequality). In the following, we will slightly abuse notations, and use M to refer to the underlying set of points. Also, we assume that we are provided with a black box, such that given any two points x and y, we can compute the distances dM(x, y) in constant time. For example of a metric, IR 2 with the regular euclidean distance is a metric space. Another standard example is a graph G with non-negative weights ω(·) defined on the edges, and let dG(x, y) denote the shortest path (under the given weights) between any x, y ∈ V(G). It is easy to verify that dG(·, ·) is a metric. In fact, any finite metric (i. e., a metric defined over a finite set) can be represented by such a weighted graph...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormones have a {{key role}} in both the {{developing}} and adult central nervous system and skeletal muscle. The thyroid gland produces mainly thyroxine (T 4) but the intracellular concentrations of 3, 5, 3 '-triiodothyronine (T 3; the transcriptionally active hormone) in the central nervous system and skeletal muscle are modulated by the activity of type 2 deiodinase (D 2). To date no neurological syndrome has been associated with mutations in the DIO 2 gene and previous studies in young and juvenile D 2 -knockout mice (D 2 KO) did not find gross neurological alterations, possibly due to compensatory mechanisms. AIM: This study aims to analyze the motor phenotype of 3 -and- 6 -month-old D 2 KO mice to evaluate the role of D 2 on the motor system at adult stages in which compensatory mechanisms could have failed. RESULTS: Motor abilities were explored by validated tests. In the footprint test, D 2 KO showed an altered global gait pattern (mice walked slower, with shorter strides and with a hindlimb wider base of support than wild-type mice). No differences were detected in the balance beam test. However, a reduced latency to fall was found in the rotarod, <b>coat-hanger</b> and four limb hanging wire tests indicating impairment on coordination and prehensile reflex and a reduction of muscle strength. In histological analyses of cerebellum and skeletal muscle, D 2 KO mice did not present gross structural abnormalities. Thyroid hormones levels and deiodinases activities were also determined. In D 2 KO mice, despite euthyroid T 3 and high T 4 plasma levels, T 3 levels were significantly reduced in cerebral cortex (48 % reduction) and skeletal muscle (33 % reduction), but not in the cerebellum where other deiodinase (type 1) is expressed. CONCLUSIONS: The motor alterations observed in D 2 KO mice indicate an important role for D 2 in T 3 availability to maintain motor function and muscle strength.
