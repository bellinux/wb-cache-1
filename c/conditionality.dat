5|$|IMF members {{signed the}} Jamaica Agreement in January 1976, which {{ratified}} {{the end of}} the Bretton Woods system and reoriented the Fund's role in supporting the international monetary system. The agreement officially embraced the flexible exchange rate regimes that emerged after the failure of the Smithsonian Agreement measures. In tandem with floating exchange rates, the agreement endorsed central bank interventions aimed at clearing excessive volatility. The agreement retroactively formalized the abandonment of gold as a reserve instrument and the Fund subsequently demonetized its gold reserves, returning gold to members or selling it to provide poorer nations with relief funding. Developing countries and countries not endowed with oil export resources enjoyed greater access to IMF lending programs as a result. The Fund continued assisting nations experiencing balance of payments deficits and currency crises, but began imposing <b>conditionality</b> on its funding that required countries to adopt policies aimed at reducing deficits through spending cuts and tax increases, reducing protective trade barriers, and contractionary monetary policy.|$|E
5|$|In January 2000, Baird {{unveiled}} {{a series of}} initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system. This was highlighted by {{the establishment of a}} welfare fraud hotline and a complementary <b>conditionality</b> three months later, in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program. The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, but critics of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs. In mid-year, Baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province.|$|E
25|$|IMF <b>conditionality</b> {{is a set}} of {{policies}} or conditions that the IMF requires in exchange for financial resources. The IMF does require collateral from countries for loans but also requires the government seeking assistance to correct its macroeconomic imbalances in the form of policy reform. If the conditions are not met, the funds are withheld. The concept of <b>conditionality</b> was introduced in a 1952 Executive Board decision and later incorporated into the Articles of Agreement.|$|E

30|$|<b>Conditionalities</b> {{can come}} in the form of ‘soft’ {{requirements}} such as to search for a job or to participate in some kind of training, or in the form of ‘hard’ obligations as for example workfare. In both cases, the <b>conditionalities</b> operate under the principle of ‘rights and obligations’ (or ‘mutual responsibilities’).|$|R
40|$|This article aims {{to develop}} a {{reflection}} about the income transfer programs developed in Latin America and the various <b>conditionalities</b> that are required from the beneficiaries {{to stay in the}} programs, considering four countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico). Therefore, initially it is presented a context of the socio-economical landscape of Latin America, which highlights the structural reforms, economic growth and social spending of the countries mentioned. The second step is to characterize the Program Income Transfer, focusing the <b>conditionalities</b> of each of the countries analyzed in order to identify their proposals, similarities and differences, and attempting to problematize the <b>conditionalities</b> required from the beneficiaries to stay in the programs, relating them to meet the Millennium Development Goals...|$|R
25|$|Even {{the very}} first prepulse of a test session induces inhibition, which {{indicates}} that conditioning and learning are not necessary for this effect to occur. However, the lack of <b>conditionality</b> has been questioned.|$|E
25|$|The {{criticism}} {{is that the}} system of voting power distribution through a quota system institutionalises borrower subordination and creditor dominance. The resulting division of the IMF's membership into borrowers and non-borrowers has increased the controversy around <b>conditionality</b> because the borrowers are interested in increasing loan access while creditors want to maintain reassurance that the loans will be repaid.|$|E
25|$|International {{politics}} play {{an important}} role in IMF decision making. The clout of member states is roughly proportional to its contribution to IMF finances. The United States has the greatest number of votes and therefore wields the most influence. Domestic politics often come into play, with politicians in developing countries using <b>conditionality</b> to gain leverage over the opposition to influence policy.|$|E
50|$|Income {{transfers}} can {{be either}} conditional or unconditional. <b>Conditionalities</b> are sometimes criticized as being paternalistic and unnecessary.|$|R
30|$|As {{discussed}} above, subsidies {{can include}} <b>conditionalities</b> on employers and beneficiaries. In {{the case of}} employers, countries could consider imposing restrictions on the dismissal of workers {{in order to reduce}} substitution effects. They can also condition the subsidy on extending the length of the employment contract after the subsidy expires. Because of monitoring and enforcement reasons, however, it is unclear that the benefits of these <b>conditionalities</b> outweigh the costs.|$|R
50|$|However, {{studies suggest}} that these {{eligibility}} conditions and other <b>conditionalities</b> exclude {{a large number of}} women from receiving their entitlements.|$|R
25|$|One {{view is that}} <b>conditionality</b> {{undermines}} {{domestic political}} institutions. The recipient governments are sacrificing policy autonomy in exchange for funds, {{which can lead to}} public resentment of the local leadership for accepting and enforcing the IMF conditions. Political instability can result from more leadership turnover as political leaders are replaced in electoral backlashes. IMF conditions are often criticised for reducing government services, thus increasing unemployment.|$|E
25|$|Coalitional {{psychology}} is {{an approach to}} explain political behaviors between different coalitions and the <b>conditionality</b> of these behaviors in evolutionary psychological perspective. This approach assumes that since human beings appeared on the earth, they have evolved to live in groups instead of living as individuals to achieve benefits such as more mating opportunities and increased status. Human beings thus naturally think and act {{in a way that}} manages and negotiates group dynamics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conditionality</b> also reassures the IMF {{that the}} funds lent to {{them will be}} used for the {{purposes}} defined by the Articles of Agreement and provides safeguards that country will be able to rectify its macroeconomic and structural imbalances. In the judgment of the IMF, the adoption by the member of certain corrective measures or policies will allow it to repay the IMF, thereby ensuring that the resources will be available to support other members.|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of debates on the {{performance}} of EU Cohesion policy, this paper considers how the EU has used control mechanisms to influence the use of Structural Funds by Member States. Using the principal-agent model, this paper examines empirically three case studies of <b>conditionalities</b> applied to the absorption of funding (decommitment rule), outcomes of interventions (performance reserve) and targeting of expenditure (earmarking) in EU programmes over the 2000 - 13 period. The findings reveal different levels of effectiveness of the three <b>conditionalities,</b> attributable to the differential scope for trade-offs during the regulatory negotiations, external pressure and principal self-interest. From a policy perspective, the paper discusses an effectiveness threshold for introducing controls, the tensions between multiple <b>conditionalities,</b> and the limitations of top-down control mechanisms in influencing agent behaviour...|$|R
30|$|Subsidies {{can include}} <b>conditionalities</b> on {{employers}} and beneficiaries. In the first case, {{the two main}} goals are to reduce substitution effects and to provide incentives to increase contracts’ length. Substitution effects can be reduced if employers {{are not allowed to}} dismiss workers for a given period after having hired a subsidized worker. The subsidy can also be conditioned on extending the length of the employment contract after the subsidy expires. Several of the OECD programs use this type of <b>conditionalities</b> on employers (see Banerji and Robalino 2009).|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, {{public-private}} partnership policy has been adopted in developing countries {{to a lesser degree}} than in industrialised countries. This paper argues that this policy has been diffused to developing countries like Sri Lanka with coercion from international aid-granting organisations through <b>conditionalities</b> attached to financial assistance. It details the country-specific challenges faced by Sri Lanka in responding to <b>conditionalities</b> as it has sought to implement this policy. Drawing on policy diffusion theory the paper develops a framework to be used in analysing the issues under investigation. 21 page(s...|$|R
25|$|In addition, the IMF negotiates {{conditions}} on lending and loans under their policy of <b>conditionality,</b> {{which was established}} in the 1950s. Low-income countries can borrow on concessional terms, which means there is a period of time with no interest rates, through the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), the Standby Credit Facility (SCF) and the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF). Nonconcessional loans, which include interest rates, are provided mainly through Stand-By Arrangements (SBA), the Flexible Credit Line (FCL), the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), and the Extended Fund Facility. The IMF provides emergency assistance via the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to members facing urgent balance-of-payments needs.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} to the encyclical's continued prohibitions of artificial birth control was very mixed. In Italy, Spain, Portugal and Poland, the encyclical was welcomed. In Latin America, much support developed for the Pope and his encyclical. As World Bank President Robert McNamara declared at the 1968 Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group that countries permitting birth control practices would get preferential access to resources, doctors in La Paz, Bolivia called it insulting that money should be exchanged for the conscience of a Catholic nation. In Colombia, Cardinal archbishop Aníbal Muñoz Duque declared, if American <b>conditionality</b> undermines Papal teachings, we prefer not to receive one cent. The Senate of Bolivia passed a resolution stating that Humanae vitae could be discussed in its implications for individual consciences, but was of greatest significance because the papal document defended the rights of developing nations to determine their own population policies. The Jesuit Journal Sic dedicated one edition to the encyclical with supportive contributions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a public choice model {{that consists of}} a special interest group that benefits from distortionary economic policies, the general public who suffers from such policies, and a government that implements these policies. The paper examines how these actors respond to externally imposed conditions that force the government either to implement economic reforms or face the loss of outside assistance. Depending on the domestic political environment, the imposition of economic <b>conditionalities</b> may prove effective, unnecessary, or even counterproductive.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the new lending <b>conditionalities</b> of the Bretton Woods {{institutions in the}} area of “governance” in a sample of twenty-five upper tranche arrangements in 1999. It finds that the scope and number of conditions, defined both narrowly and loosely, have expanded. Is this expansion likely {{to improve the quality of}} the development process? The paper's findings are negative based on a retrospective analysis of the effectiveness of <b>conditionalities</b> in shaping borrower behavior as well as the content of the current agenda with respect to three important issues: the problems posed by aggregation and trade-offs among conditionalities; the relative emphasis on external versus internal factors; and the temporal dimension of the institutional underpinnings of “good governance. ” The paper argues that the pessimistic prognosis is further reinforced when taking into account the governance and interests of the IFIs themselves and their consequences on the content and enforcement of <b>conditionalities.</b> IMF, World Bank, IDA, Governance, Conditionally, sovereignty,...|$|R

2500|$|In August 2003, Kyin Nyunt {{announced}} a seven-step [...] "roadmap to democracy", {{which the government}} claims {{it is in the}} process of implementing. There is no timetable associated with the government's plan, or any <b>conditionality</b> or independent mechanism for verifying that it is moving forward. For these reasons, most Western governments and Burma's neighbours have been sceptical and critical of the roadmap.|$|E
2500|$|Jeffrey Sachs {{argues that}} the IMF's [...] "usual {{prescription}} is 'budgetary belt tightening to countries who are much too poor to own belts'". Sachs wrote that the IMF's role as a generalist institution specialising in macroeconomic issues needs reform. <b>Conditionality</b> has also been criticised because a country can pledge collateral of [...] "acceptable assets" [...] to obtain waivers—if one assumes that all countries are able to provide [...] "acceptable collateral".|$|E
50|$|Another common {{obstacle}} {{to success in}} most CCTs is exclusion of needy homes in the targeting process. In an assessment by the World Bank, much exclusion was due to remote communities' inability to access schools or clinics. Many such communities fall into developing countries' most poverty-stricken populations but cannot follow through with <b>conditionalities</b> since the transportation costs to attend schools or hospital visits outweigh the benefits. Furthermore, an evaluation of Mexico's Progresa-Oportunidades program addresses the issue that those in poverty with debilitating illnesses can be excluded from CCTs due to their physical inability to accomplish the <b>conditionalities.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{understand}} how the loan <b>conditionalities</b> of the knowledge banks—the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) are affecting the funding of higher education in West Africa generally by particularly comparing Ghana, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. The role of higher education has been linked with development, and development has remained a concerned issue in Africa. The commitment of the states in funding higher education in order to achieve the desired goal of development is continuously met with difficulty. The reliance of these countries on the loans of the knowledge banks, which are associated with policy conditions, has been geared toward achieving this target of development through higher education. Conceptualizing loan <b>conditionalities</b> from a neo-colonial perspective, the concern of this study is, therefore, to find out how the conditions of these banks’ loans, to these developing countries, differ and possibly affect their higher education funding toward achieving this development goal.. Inasmuch as these <b>conditionalities</b> are established on neoliberal principles of market force—profit maximization—it is doubtful that these conditions will vary among these countries in their higher education funding systems, in spite of their socio-political and economic differences...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find out the challenges facing the poor households to comply with cash transfer <b>conditionalities.</b> In the context of the increasing demand of conditional cash transfers in the development agenda of many less developed countries, this research study provides an analytical overview of the challenges faced by the poor households and the Most Vulnerable Children (MVC) in complying with the <b>conditionalities</b> of the Productive Social Safety Net (PSSN) Programme. This study was conducted at Iguguno Ward, Mkalama District Council in Singida Region. The identified poor households with children receive cash transfer but in turn their children are required to be enrolled to schools and fulfill the required conditions set by TASAF. In order to continue receiving cash transfer bimonthly their children are supposed to keep on attending to schools. Interviews were directed to officials who are responsible for the day to day implementation activities at the local government council, questionnaires were directed to local government leaders, teachers and head of the households, while in-depth focused group discussions were conducted with local government leaders and school teachers. This study noted that there were pending issues and remaining challenges for the programme, these relate in particular to strengthening mechanisms of local participation; coordinating the CCT with other dimensions such as productive projects; lengthening the duration of benefits for meeting human-capital objectives through cash transfer <b>conditionalities...</b>|$|R
