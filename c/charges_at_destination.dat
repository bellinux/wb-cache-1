Fixed charge solid {{transportation}} {{problems are}} formulated under a budget constraint <b>at</b> each <b>destination.</b> Unit transportation costs, fixed <b>charges,</b> sources <b>at</b> origins, demands <b>at</b> <b>destinations,</b> conveyances capacities {{are assumed to}} be crisp or fuzzy. Budget constraints <b>at</b> <b>destinations</b> are imposed. It is also assumed that transported units are crisp. So the problem is formulated as constraint optimization programming problem in crisp and fuzzy environments. As optimization of fuzzy objective as well as consideration of fuzzy constraint is not well defined, credibility of fuzzy event are used to transform the problem into equivalent crisp problem. The reduced crisp problem is solved following Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG) method using lingo software. The models are illustrated with numerical examples...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{segmenting}} cruise {{passengers in}} order to identify passengers' profiles according to their behavior <b>at</b> <b>destination.</b> Through an integrated use of traditional survey instruments and of GPS technologies, a set of indicators for the analysis of passengers' mobility <b>at</b> <b>destination</b> is proposed. Data collected in the port of Palermo are used {{in order to}} investigate space-time activities of cruise passengers <b>at</b> the <b>destination.</b> Monothetic Analysis is used in order to segment passengers according to their behavior <b>at</b> <b>destination,</b> and groups are then compared in terms of socio-demographic characteristics and other variables collected through questionnaire-based survey. Results identify seven different broad patterns of activity, and indicate that several socio-demographic characteristics and other features of passengers seem to be associated with movement patterns <b>at</b> <b>destination.</b> A better knowledge of cruise passengers' behavior <b>at</b> <b>destination</b> is a fundamental pre-requisite in order to better serve visitors' needs and meet their expectations...|$|R

This paper expands upon these findings by showing that political participation is irreducible to socioeconomic determinants. We need to factor in individuals’ agency.

30|$|Corollary 2 {{shows that}} the {{achievable}} diversity order is one when the transmitter only has access to a delayed version of the CSI. Moreover, whether the interference <b>at</b> the <b>destination</b> affects the outage probability of the system depends {{on the number of}} antennas employed <b>at</b> the <b>destination.</b> It is worth noting that when the destination has a single antenna, the interference <b>at</b> the <b>destination</b> will affect the outage probability of the system. Otherwise, the interference <b>at</b> the <b>destination</b> has no impact on the outage probability.|$|R
40|$|Adaptive routing, which {{dynamically}} selects {{the route}} of a packet, has been widely studied for interconnection networks in massively parallel computers and system area networks. Although adaptive routing {{has the advantage of}} providing high bandwidth, it may deliver packets out-of-order, which some message passing libraries don’t accept. In this paper, we propose two mechanisms called 1) FIFO transmission and 2) couple limitation to guarantee in-order packet delivery in adaptive routing. Both of them limit packet injection at source hosts. The FIFO transmission completely avoids packet sorting <b>at</b> <b>destination</b> hosts, while the couple limitation uses few additional buffers to sort packets <b>at</b> <b>destination</b> hosts. Evaluation results show that the FIFO transmission and the couple limitation achieve a similar throughput to that of a method equipped with huge (infinite) buffers enough to store all outof-order packets <b>at</b> <b>destination</b> hosts under both synthetic traffic and NAS Parallel Benchmarks...|$|R
