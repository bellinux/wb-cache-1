50|$|This {{measurement}} {{suggests the}} opposite conclusion, {{that the average}} causal effect {{is an increase in}} blood pressure. One obtains this result because the positive <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> for Joe is a larger percentage of his blood pressure. This would occur if Joe's blood pressure is lower than the blood pressure of the other subjects. For example, Joe's blood pressure is 140 and increase by 14 mm Hg, an increase of 10%. If Mary's blood pressure is 200 mm Hg and her blood pressure increases by 14 mm Hg, then her blood pressure only increases by 7%. Consequently, a small absolute <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> would yield a larger percentage change for Joe.|$|E

50|$|Pfeiffer {{spent the}} rest of her life in Key West, with {{frequent}} visits to California, until her death on October 1, 1951, aged 56. Her death was attributed to an acute state of shock related to her son Gregory's arrest and a subsequent phone call from Ernest. Gregory, who had experienced gender identity issues for most of his life, had been arrested as a male caught entering a woman's restroom in a movie theater. Years later, after he had become a medical doctor, Gregory interpreted his mother's autopsy report as indicating that Pauline had died due to a pheochromocytoma tumor on one of her adrenal glands. His theory was that the phone call from Ernest had caused the tumor to secrete excessive adrenalin, and then stop, the resultant <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> causing her to go into the acute shock that caused her death.|$|E
50|$|During {{compensatory}} phenomena, {{many factors}} {{of an animal}} may become subject to change. One {{of these is the}} blood volume, which can vary anywhere from 6-8.5ml/100g of body weight. The blood volume of T. carnifex has a direct relationship with the blood pressure of the animal, and so when there is a change in blood volume, there will also be a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> Because the vascular structures and systems (referred to as the vascular components) have dilatability, changes in blood pressure are permitted to allow for changes in blood volume. One hypothesis is that blood pressure is vital and defining in the storing or releasing of oxygen to and from the spleen. This is possible, because no structure (anatomical, histological, or otherwise) has been found that could explain this compensatory phenomenon, and because blood pressure would have no such structures, it becomes a strong component for the responsibility of the splenic activity. In T. carnifex, respiration in the lungs is not nearly as important as the cutaneous compartments. Much research has taken place with anesthetized T. carnifex, and under these circumstances cutaneous respiration is the sole method of breathing.|$|E

50|$|Arterioles have muscular walls (usually {{only one}} to two layers of smooth muscle) and are the primary site of {{vascular}} resistance. The greatest <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and velocity of blood flow occurs at the transition of arterioles to capillaries. The decreased velocity of flow in the capillaries increases the blood pressure, due to Bernoulli's principle. This induces gas and nutrients {{to move from the}} blood to the cells, due to the lower osmotic pressure outside of the capillary. The opposite process occurs when the blood leaves the capillaries and enters the venules, where the blood pressure drops due to an increase in flow rate. Arterioles receive autonomic nervous system innervation and respond to various circulating hormones in order to regulate their diameter. Retinal vessels lack a functional sympathetic innervation.Further local responses to stretch, carbon dioxide, pH, and oxygen also influence arteriolar tone. Generally, norepinephrine and epinephrine (hormones produced by sympathetic nerves and the adrenal gland medulla) are vasoconstrictive acting on alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. However, the arterioles of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and pulmonary circulation vasodilate in response to these hormones when they act on beta-adrenergic receptors. Generally, stretch and high oxygen tension increase tone, and carbon dioxide and low pH promote vasodilation. Pulmonary arterioles are a noteworthy exception as they vasodilate in response to high oxygen. Brain arterioles are particularly sensitive to pH with reduced pH promoting vasodilation. A number of hormones influence arteriole tone such as angiotensin II (vasoconstrictive), endothelin (vasoconstrictive), bradykinin (vasodilation), atrial natruretic peptide (vasodilation), and prostacyclin (vasodilation).|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether there is a difference in the amount of change of blood pressure after exercise among people with different morphological characteristics, especially with differences in percent of body fat. 30 healthy subjects (15 males and 15 females) aged 25 - 30 years were included in the study. They were measured for weight and height, and their body composition was assesed by bioelectrical impendance device GAYA 357. Blood pressure was measured at rest and immediately after performing Cooper´s test. After classification of subjects according to BMI (body mass index) and according to percent of body fat (PBF) differences in the size of <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> among categories were compared. Results indicate that there is no difference between sexes in amount of change for DBP, but there is difference in change of SBP; in males this change was significantly higher than in females.
