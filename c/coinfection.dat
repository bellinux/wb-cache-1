Although rare in young children with severe malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women. <b>Coinfection</b> of HIV with malaria increases mortality.

500|$|Three {{groups of}} HIV-1 have been {{identified}} {{on the basis of}} differences in the envelope (env) region: M, N, and O. Group M is the most prevalent and is subdivided into eight subtypes (or clades), based on the whole genome, which are geographically distinct. The most prevalent are subtypes B (found mainly in North America and Europe), A and D (found mainly in Africa), and C (found mainly in Africa and Asia); these subtypes form branches in the phylogenetic tree representing the lineage of the M group of HIV-1. <b>Coinfection</b> with distinct subtypes gives rise to circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). In 2000, the last year in which an analysis of global subtype prevalence was made, 47.2% of infections worldwide were of subtype C, 26.7% were of subtype A/CRF02_AG, 12.3% were of subtype B, 5.3% were of subtype D, 3.2% were of CRF_AE, and the remaining 5.3% were composed of other subtypes and CRFs. Most HIV-1 research is focused on subtype B; few laboratories focus on the other subtypes. The existence of a fourth group, [...] "P", has been hypothesised based on a virus isolated in 2009. The strain is apparently derived from gorilla SIV (SIVgor), first isolated from western lowland gorillas in 2006.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the frequency of <b>coinfections</b> in leprosy patients and {{whether there is a}} relationship between the presence of <b>coinfections</b> and the development of leprosy reactional episodes. METHOD: A cross-sectional study based on an analysis of the medical records of the patients who were treated at the Leprosy Clinics of the Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, was conducted from 2000 to 2010. Information was recorded regarding the age, sex, clinical status, WHO classification, treatment, presence of reactions and <b>coinfections.</b> Focal and systemic infections were diagnosed based on the history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations between the leprosy reactions and the patients' gender, age, WHO classification and <b>coinfections.</b> RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-five patients were studied. Most of these patients were males (155 / 225 = 68. 8 %) of an average age of 49. 31 +/- 15. 92 years, and the most prevalent clinical manifestation was the multibacillary (MB) form (n = 146), followed by the paucibacillary (PB) form (n = 79). Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) was more prevalent (78 / 122 = 63. 9 %) than the reversal reaction (RR) (44 / 122 = 36. 1 %), especially in the MB patients (OR 5. 07; CI 2. 86 - 8. 99; p< 0. 0001) who exhibited <b>coinfections</b> (OR 2. 26; CI 1. 56 - 3. 27; p< 0. 0001). Eighty-eight (88 / 225 = 39. 1 %) patients exhibited <b>coinfections.</b> Oral <b>coinfections</b> were the most prevalent (40 / 88 = 45. 5 %), followed by urinary tract infections (17 / 88 = 19. 3 %), sinusopathy (6 / 88 = 6. 8 %), hepatitis C (6 / 88 = 6. 8 %), and hepatitis B (6 / 88 = 6. 8 %).

In Taiwan, cases of severe influenza with aspergillosis are increasingly reported. Therefore, we describe the relative risk of mortality among severe influenza patients with aspergillosis and other <b>coinfections</b> compared to severe influenza patients without Aspergillus <b>coinfections.</b> Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 124 adult patients with severe influenza in a tertiary medical center in southern Taiwan from January 2015 through March 2016. The definition of probable aspergillosis required abnormal radiological findings and positive Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) antigen and/or Aspergillus isolation. Results: Probable aspergillosis (detected throughout the whole course) and other <b>coinfections</b> (only community-acquired) were diagnosed in 21 (17 %) and 38 (31 %) of all patients respectively. Klebsiella pneumoniae (36. 8 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31. 6 %) and Staphylococcus aureus (31. 6 %) were the most frequent isolates of other <b>coinfections.</b> In-ICU mortality of Aspergillus group (66. 7 %) {{was significantly higher than}} other <b>coinfections</b> (23. 7 %, p =  0. 001) or control group without <b>coinfections</b> (15. 4 %, p <  0. 001), with significant odds ratios after adjusting for important variables.

Conclusion: Dual Aspergillus and influenza infection is emerging in southern Taiwan. Meanwhile, community-acquired P. aeruginosa should be listed in the common copathogens with severe influenza.

40|$|<b>Coinfections</b> {{of sexually}} {{transmitted}} infections are frequent {{due to the}} same transmission routes which may facilitate the transmission of other sexually transmitted infections.

The shared transmission routes, impairment of the immune response, elevated cytokine levels and the associated inflammatory milieu produce local tissue damage, breaches in mucosal epithelium, which increases the risk of human immunodeficiency virus infection.

P. carinii f. sp. carinii karyotype forms 1, 2, and 6 were inoculated into immunosuppressed rats, individually and in dual combinations, spaced 0, 10, and 20 days apart. Infections comprised of both organism forms resulted from admixtures inoculated at the same time. In contrast, <b>coinfections</b> did not develop in most rats, where a 10 - or 20 -day gap was inserted between inoculations; only the first organism form inoculated was detected by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in the resultant infection.

A role for the host response in the elimination of the second population and in reduction of the organism burden was suggested by the lack of direct killing of forms 1 and 2 in an in vitro ATP assay, by reduction of the burden by autoclaved organisms, and by the specific reactions of forms 1 and 2 but not forms 1 and 6.
