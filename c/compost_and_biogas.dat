40|$|The solid {{slaughter}} house waste (SSW) in Indonesia {{is generally}} disposed of into open dumped landfill. This type {{of solid waste}} can cause odor and atmospheric pollution if discharged directly into the environment. Additionally, it may spread disease due to the nesting vectors, and the resulting leachate can lead to groundwater contamination. This paper reviews the characterization of slaughter house (SH) types and SSW generation potential and to review the development of treatment technology of SSW and its application. The SH in Indonesia is divided into 3 classes, namely: 1) SH for large and small ruminants; 2) SH for poultry; 3) SH for pigs.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} potential {{methods to}} estimate the nitrogen fertilization value of {{a broad spectrum of}} different organic fertilizers. Ryegrass pot experi-ments were used to determine the nitrogen fertilization effect of 15 different fertilizers. These included different kinds of manure, different powders made from offal, rapeseed cake, lucerne pellets, sewage sludge, biogas residue, vi-nasse and mussel compost. Incubation studies showed that previously degraded materials such as manure, <b>compost</b> <b>and</b> <b>biogas</b> residue had low net nitrogen mineralization after addition to soil, whereas net mineralization was high from undegraded materials such as pelleted plant or meat products. The short-term nitrogen fertilizer value of degraded materials was therefore rather well characterized by their ammonium content, whereas the undegraded fertilizer materials required a different method. Warm water-extractable nitrogen proved to be unsatisfactory as a method for extracting readily mineralizable nitrogen, especially from animal products. Amino acid nitrogen and crude fibre analysis were also unsatisfactory for describing readily degradable or more persistent organic material. However, the carbon/nitrogen ratio very accurately reflected the short-term plant-available nitrogen content. Measurements of near infrared reflectance (NIR) proved to have {{the potential to be a}} quick and cheap method {{to estimate the}} fertilizer value of the nitrogen in fertilizers. However, developing a satisfactory model for NIR measurements would require more extensive material than the 15 fertilizers examined here. Nevertheless, it should be possible to use the carbon/nitrogen ratio already, through its negative linear relationship with the proportion of total fertilizer nitrogen with short-term fertilizer effect. A ratio of around two indicates that approximately 80 % of the nitrogen is as available as mineral fertilizer nitrogen, while a ratio above 15 means that scarcely any short-term nitrogen fertilization effect will be obtained from that fertilizer...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{populations and}} the {{increasing}} use of existing resources has led to growth in organic waste emissions. Therefore, a sustainable approach to managing this waste has become a major concern in densely populated areas. Biological treatment is an efficient method for reducing the amount of organic waste, and for producing energy. A large number of biogas plants and compost facilities that use organic waste as a substrate for electricity and fuel production are being built around the world. The biological treatment process in these plants produces large amounts of organic waste, and there is therefore a growing need to find a sustainable use for this material. Organic waste, such as biogas residues and compost can be a valuable fertilizer for agricultural soils. They can serve as a source of plant nutrients and can also improve soil structure and water holding capacity. However, as organic residues are known to contain both heavy metals and organic contaminants {{there is a need for}} long term field experiments to ensure that soil and plant quality is maintained. In order to investigate the potential risks and benefits of using organic waste in agriculture, an 8 Â year field experiment was established in central Sweden. Under realistic conditions, <b>compost</b> <b>and</b> <b>biogas</b> residues from source-separated household waste were compared with traditional mineral fertilizer. We examined crop yield and soil chemical and microbiological properties. The main conclusion from the field experiment was that biogas residues resulted in crop yields almost as high as the mineral fertilizer NPS. In addition, several important soil microbiological properties, such as substrate induced respiration, potential ammonium oxidation and nitrogen mineralization were improved after application of both biogas residues and compost. Moreover, no negative effects could be detected from using either of the organic wastes. In particular the genetic structure of the soil bacterial community appeared to resist changes caused by addition of organic waste.

This problem emanates from the generation of SW which is currently {{on a large scale}} as cities expand. The aims of this study were to determine the composition of the various waste components disposed of to the Marie Louise landfill site (LS), evaluates the elemental composition and proximate analysis of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), conducts an economic analysis of setting up a recycling facility and to finally evaluating the perception of the general public with regards to the current waste management (WM) services in the City of Johannesburg (CoJ). The objectives of this study were to determine the various waste components disposed of to the LS as a baseline to propose complete diversion of wastes from going to the LS; to determine the suitability of food waste (FW) generated as a potential source of <b>compost</b> <b>and</b> <b>biogas</b> generation; to carry out an economic evaluation of setting up a recycling facility as a source of revenue to the municipality and potential source of jobs opportunities for the youths in the municipality and finally to assess the level of awareness of the people towards municipal solid waste management (MSWM). The waste composition studies were conducted during the summer in 2015 and during the winter in 2016 at the LS. The results of the analysis were classified into two groups based on two of the services offered by Pikitup (PU) (the municipality) (Dailies non compacted and Round collected refuse (RCR) compacted wastes collection services). STATA 12 software was used to determine seasonal variation on the main components of the wastes generated between the summer and the winter exercises for both services. The results obtained showed that p-values were too extreme (when the null hypothesis is true, the p-value is the probability of obtaining a result equal to or “more extreme” than what was actually observed. The p-values obtained for both the Dailies and for the RCR were (p-value = 0. 9775) and (p-value = 0. 9760) respectively. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also used to evaluate seasonal variation in both seasons on both services for the sub-division of the waste streams. Results obtained showed (p-value = 0. 9999) for Dailies and (p-value = 0. 9913) for RCR. These results show that the differences between the winter and summer for both services were not statistically significant. The elemental composition and proximate analysis of the FW was also evaluated. The analysis gave a C/N of 22. 66 and an empirical formula of C 27 H 44 NO 16.

40|$|The Thi 8 s {{abattoir}} in Senegal is {{no longer}} a source of environmental pollution. The solid waste from slaughtered animals is fermented in a tank. This produces <b>compost</b> <b>and</b> <b>biogas,</b> the biogas being used to provide power to the abattoir. The waste water is purified by a lagoon system. Vast pastoral regions stretch across the Sahel and the huge number of animals slaughtered causes serious pollution problems around the region's abattoirs. More than 15, 500 tonnes of animal waste pile up each year in the areas surrounding the cities causing pollution and, because they produce methane, intensifying the greenhouse effect. Furthermore, 570, 000 cubic metres of waste water are released every year into water systems, such as the Hann Bay in Dakar, the Niger River at Niamey or the Abidjan lagoon, which are often already over-saturated by pollutants. Specialists addressing this problem have rejected the use of traditional purifying stations primarily on the grounds of cost, but also because abattoir waste is rich in organic matter which could be put to good use. Since 1989 the Soci 9 t 9 d'exploitation des ressources animales au S 9 n 9 gal (SERAS), together with the Centre de coop 9 ration internationale en recherche agronomique pour le d 9 veloppement (CIRAD), has been operating a pilot scheme for the treatment of animal waste from the abattoir in Thi 8 s, Senegal's second city. The results of this project will be transferred from Thi 8 s to the Dakar slaughterhouse, where 43, 000 tonnes of untreated waste are dumped in the Hann Bay annually, not counting the water used for rinsing the hides, which is full of extremely toxic substances such as arsenic. A solution to this problem was long overdue especially since Senegal, in common with most other countries across Africa, is now considering bringing in regulations for the disposal of animal waste products and introducing taxes on pollution. Fermenting and composting the solid waste The waste which once polluted the environment of Thi 8 s (stomach contents, blood, faecal and visceral matter) is nowadays put in a large tank, the Transpaille fermenter, where it decomposes. 2000 t of carcasses and 480 t of waste products produce 55 t of compost. 'The chemical and biological fertility of cultivated land is hard to maintain, especially in tropical regions, and organic enrichment is necessary. The compost produced by treating abattoir waste is a new and high-quality form of fertilizer,' explains ClRAD's Jean-Luc Farinet. There are no difficulties in finding outlets for this compost near Niayes, where there are 10, 000 ha of market gardens. The only problem is the price, which at 42 FCFA per kg gross is considerably higher than the 15 FCFA charged for groundnut powder, the fertilizer traditionally used in Senegal. To offset this disadvantage the Thi 8 s abattoir has launched a range of garden-ready seedlings in soil packs which are composed of 75...|$|E
40|$|Cadmium (Cd) is {{extremely}} toxic metal which usually causes reduction in plant growth and inhibits native biota. The toxic effects of Cd on plant growth and bacterial community may decrease {{with the help}} of different bacterial and organic amendments (bacteria, compost, biogas slurry). Bacterial and organic amendments (BOA) may stabilize Cd in soil and alleviate Cd stress on plants. A series of experiments in controlled and natural environments were conducted to achieve these objectives. Cadmium toxicity may reduce seed germination and seedling growth of wheat and maize. These cereals were exposed to various levels of Cd (0, 5, 20, 50 and 80 mg L- 1) to evaluate its effect on seed germination and seedling growth of four wheat and three maize cultivars. Wheat cultivars Sehar- 06 and Inqlab- 91 whereas maize cultivars SH- 919 and PH- 3068 was found tolerant and sensitive, respectively to Cd stress. The sensitive cultivars of wheat and maize were further used in successive experiments. The different levels (0, 5, 10, 15 Mg ha- 1) each of <b>compost</b> <b>and</b> <b>biogas</b> slurry used to deterimine their effect on growth of sensitive cultivars exposed to different levels of Cd (0, 5, 20, 50, 80 mg kg- 1 soil). Compost applied at the rate of 10 and 15 Mg ha- 1 significantly increased seedling growth, fresh and dry weight of wheat and maize, respectively, whereas biogas slurry at the rate of 15 Mg ha- 1 increased seedling growth, fresh and dry weight of both cereals under Cd stress. Thirty bacterial strains were isolated based on morphology through enrichment technique. Minimum inhibitory concentration of these strains ranged from 200 to 500 mg Cd L- 1 on LB plates and out of 30 only 11 strains showed tolerance to 80 mg Cd L- 1 in LB broth which were further evaluated for plant growth promoting activity under various Cd levels. Cadmium stress limits plant growth but CTB strains significantly increased wheat and maize growth in normal and Cd contaminated soils. On the basis of maximum point scoring CTB strains CIK- 502 and CIK- 517 Y in wheat whereas CIK- 502 and CIK- 512 in maize were found most effective in improving growth and biomass of both cereals in normal and Cd contaminated soils. The evaluation of selected BOA based on previous experiments were further assessed in sole and combination for improving wheat and maize productivity, physiology, antioxidant and Cd uptake in Cd contaminated soils (0, 20, 40 mg Cd kg- 1) in natural conditions. Growth, yield and physiology of both cereals were rigorously affected by the exogenous application of Cd, however, performance of wheat and maize improved with the application of different BOA under non-stressed and Cd stressed conditions. Application of compost in combination with CIK- 502 had maximum increase in growth, yield and physiology of wheat and maize compared to other amendments. The increased physiology, relative water content and water use efficiency whereas decreased electrolyte leakage with the application of BOA conferred their positive role in mitigating Cd stress on both cereals. On the other hand osmolytes and antioxidants increased significantly with the exogenous application of Cd. However, the combined application of different BOA significantly increased osmolytes accumulation especially compost and CIK- 502 in both cereals but the activities of CAT, APX and GR greatly differed to Cd stress. The application of different BOA in general decreased CAT, APX, GR and MDA activities. It was observed that Cd accumulated in soil and plant tissues with its increasing exogenous application in soil however BOA significantly reduced its available fraction in soil, and subsequent uptake in root, shoot, grainand total plant of wheat and maize. Cadmium concentration in total plant, root, shoot and grains of wheat and maize decreased with the addition of compost along with CIK- 502 and it was the function of AB-DTPA extractable Cd in soil. The BOA was more effectively decreased AB-DTPA extractable Cd in soil in the absence of plants.

Within the implementation of Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM) method, AD resulted in an energy balance much higher than that of aerobic composting. In fact, differently from composting, AD can significantly contribute to energy recovery, while retaining the nutrients in the digestate produced and reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The use of a rational network of towns for OFMSW collection and transportation results relevant, in terms of increased energy balance, only in the case of composting. Therefore, if AD would be implemented as OFMSW management method, by means of biogas plants, each of them placed in an area including some towns, e. g. that considered in this survey, it could highly reduce the cost and the environmental impact of waste disposal...|$|R

Bulk density of the mixtures was inversely related to the proportion of <b>compost</b> <b>and</b> followed the order of mixtures containing sand, <b>compost,</b> <b>and</b> silt loam soil> mixtures containing sand, <b>compost,</b> <b>and</b> sandy soil> mixtures containing sand <b>and</b> <b>compost</b> only.

Compaction {{as a result of an}} initial wetting process and the infiltration tests led to increases in bulk density and decreases in moisture holding capacity, with mixtures containing a silt loam component showing the greatest resistance to these effects.

40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{and discusses}} the developed integrated economic model of municipal waste {{management of the}} Czech Republic, which was developed by authors as a balanced network model {{for a set of}} sources (mostly municipalities) of municipal solid waste connected with a set of chosen waste treatment facilities processing their waste. Model is implemented as a combination of several economic submodels including environmental and economic point of view. It enables to formulate the optimisation problem in a concise way and the resulting model is easily scalable. Model involves submodels of waste prevention, collection and transport optimization, submodels of waste energy utilization (incineration <b>and</b> <b>biogas</b> plants) <b>and</b> material recycling (<b>composting)</b> <b>and</b> submodel of landfilling. Its size (number of sources and facilities) depends only upon available data. Its application is used in the case study of the South Moravia region with verification of using time series waste data. The results enable to improve decision making in waste management sector...|$|R
