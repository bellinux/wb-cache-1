5|$|Rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, and astrovirus {{are known}} to cause viral {{gastroenteritis}}. Rotavirus {{is the most common}} cause of gastroenteritis in children, and produces similar rates in both the developed and developing world. Viruses cause about 70% of episodes of infectious diarrhea in the pediatric age group. Rotavirus is a less common <b>cause</b> <b>in</b> adults due to acquired immunity. Norovirus is the <b>cause</b> <b>in</b> about 18% of all cases.|$|E
5|$|A {{spontaneous}} CSF leak is idiopathic, {{meaning the}} <b>cause</b> <b>in</b> unknown. Various scientists and physicians {{have suggested that}} this condition {{may be the result}} of an underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the spinal dura. It may also run in families and be associated with aortic aneurysms and joint hypermobility. Up to two thirds of those afflicted demonstrate some type of generalized connective tissue disorder. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are the three most common connective tissue disorders associated with SCSFLS.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1824 elections, the Relief faction gained a 22–16 {{majority}} in the state Senate and a 61–39 majority in the House. The pro-Relief majority in the state Senate subsequently elected Rowan to the U.S. Senate, which had the inadvertent effect of weakening the faction's <b>cause</b> <b>in</b> the House by removing its leader there. Rowan served in the Senate from March 4, 1825 to March 3, 1831. During the Twenty-first Congress, he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee.|$|E

5|$|During Operation Just <b>Cause</b> <b>in</b> December 1989, Navy Reserve Commodore Maria Morales from Puerto Rico was {{deployed}} to Panama and served at Rodman Naval Station. According to Morales, in Panama {{she had her}} first real experience with the anguish and impact of an armed conflict, not only on military service members, but on families as well.|$|E
5|$|Following Pitt's {{death in}} January 1806, Wilberforce began to {{collaborate}} {{more with the}} Whigs, especially the abolitionists. He gave general support to the Grenville–Fox administration, which brought more abolitionists into the cabinet; Wilberforce and Charles Fox led the campaign in the House of Commons, while Lord Grenville advocated the <b>cause</b> <b>in</b> the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|Garfield lingered for two-and-a-half {{months before}} dying on September 19, 1881. Vice President Chester A. Arthur, the New York Stalwart, {{was sworn in}} as {{president}} that night. Garfield's murder by a spoilsman inspired the nation to reform the civil service—and Arthur, erstwhile member of the Conkling machine, joined the <b>cause.</b> <b>In</b> 1883, a bipartisan majority in Congress passed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act to reform the worst of the office-seeking system, and Arthur signed the measure into law.|$|E

It provided logistical support to the 82nd Airborne Division as the division deployed in the island, supporting US Special Forces operating within. Then in 1989, the unit supported the first combat jump since World War II while supporting Operation Just <b>Cause</b> <b>in</b> Panama. It provided logistical efforts to the division {{once again in the}} region.|$|E
5|$|Intense and {{prolonged}} exposure to workplace dusts, chemicals and fumes {{increase the risk}} of COPD in both smokers and nonsmokers. Workplace exposures are believed to be the <b>cause</b> <b>in</b> 10–20% of cases. In the United States they are believed to be related to more than 30% of cases among those who have never smoked and probably represent a greater risk in countries without sufficient regulations.|$|E
5|$|Like his {{political}} career, Kogălniceanu's tracts focused on condemning Austrian ethnic and territorial policies. Also in 1875, he issued from Paris an anti-Austrian brochure about the Romanian <b>cause</b> <b>in</b> Bukovina. Called Rapt de la Bukovine d'après les documents authentiques ("The Rape of Bukovina, from Genuine Documents"), it reused old texts {{collected by the}} Hurmuzachis. The propaganda effort won support from across the floor: Junimea Conservatives (Titu Maiorescu, Theodor Rosetti, Ioan Slavici), National Liberals (D. Sturdza) and independents (Alexandru Odobescu) all signed up to the enterprise.|$|E

5|$|Many {{of those}} in the protest {{movements}} were young children {{at the time of the}} invasion and had been educated under the Indonesian system. They resented the repression of Timorese cultural and political life at the expense of the Indonesian, were ambivalent of Indonesian economic development, and spoke Portuguese amongst themselves, stressing their Portuguese heritage. Seeking help from Portugal for self-determination, they considered Indonesia an occupying force. Abroad, Fretilin's members—most notably former journalist José Ramos-Horta (later to be Prime Minister and President)—pushed their <b>cause</b> <b>in</b> diplomatic forums.|$|E
5|$|Nuttin {{frames the}} <b>cause</b> <b>in</b> terms of ownership, which has roots in {{economic}} psychology. The endowment effect {{has found that}} people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect {{is just one example}} of a more general mere-ownership effect. In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.|$|E
5|$|On January 25, 1776, Congress {{approved}} {{the establishment of}} a monument in memory of Montgomery. A state memorial service was also scheduled and carried out on February 19, 1776. Throughout the colonies, Montgomery was viewed as a hero, and Patriots tried to use his death to promote their <b>cause</b> <b>in</b> the war. Montgomery's name was used very often in literature; among the authors who used his name was Thomas Paine.|$|E

5|$|Orangutans build nests {{specialized}} {{for both}} {{day or night}} use. These are carefully constructed; young orangutans learn from observing their mother's nest-building behaviour. In fact, nest-building is a leading <b>cause</b> <b>in</b> young orangutans leaving their mother for the first time. From six months of age onwards, orangutans practice nest-building and gain proficiency {{by the time they}} are three years old.|$|E
5|$|Suicidal {{behavior}} {{is less of}} a concern when bupropion is prescribed for smoking cessation. According to a 2014 Cochrane review, while there is an association with suicide it is unclear if bupropion was the <b>cause.</b> <b>In</b> 2016 the FDA removed the black box warning about psychiatric problems when used for stopping smoking.|$|E
5|$|The White House {{travel office}} controversy, {{sometimes}} referred to as Travelgate, was the first major ethics controversy of the Clinton administration. It began in May 1993, when seven employees of the White House Travel Office were fired. This action was unusual because although theoretically staff employees serve at the pleasure of the President and could be dismissed without <b>cause,</b> <b>in</b> practice, such employees usually remain in their posts for many years.|$|E

5|$|While in Scotland, Smith {{joined the}} Glasgow Emancipation Society and met {{people in the}} Scottish and English {{abolitionist}} movement. In 1833, Great Britain abolished slavery. When Smith returned to New York, he quickly joined the American Anti-Slavery Society and worked for the <b>cause</b> <b>in</b> the United States. He worked effectively with {{both black and white}} abolitionists, for instance maintaining a friendship and correspondence with Gerrit Smith that spanned the years from 1846-65.|$|E
5|$|A {{more complex}} {{situation}} reigned in Russia. As early as April 1918, some Romanian volunteer groups joined {{up with the}} Bolshevik Red Army, taking their orders from Commissar Béla Kun, but some of their members continued to serve the nationalist <b>cause.</b> <b>In</b> June 1918, a number of Romanian prisoners who had {{signed up for the}} Volunteer Corps were cut off from Romania by the Russian Civil War and left to fend for themselves. Some crossed into Bolshevik Russia hoping to be repatriated together with the Romanian consulate, while others took to areas controlled by the White movement, reaching Irkutsk; still others escaped through northern routes into Sweden. The various groups were monitored by French public opinion, and plans were drafted to merge them into the Romanian Legion on the Western Front, or even to have them open up a new Eastern Front.|$|E
5|$|According to Sarma, Gandhi {{recruited}} {{women to}} participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity in the mainstream of Indian public life. However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because he feared he would be accused of using women as political shield. When women insisted that they join the movement and public demonstrations, according to Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join him. Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions and views, Indian women joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. After Gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the <b>cause</b> <b>in</b> a manner Gandhi inspired.|$|E
