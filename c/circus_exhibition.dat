30|$|Agriculture {{activities}} {{began to}} flourish in Cameron Highlands since the 1970 s and practice a static shifting cultivation. In the 1990 s, Temporary Occupation Licenses (TOLs) under leasing arrangements for 40  years {{was introduced by}} the local government to tackle the illegal land clearing. TOLs was issued by Cameron Highlands District and Land Office are for temporary use only such as cultivation of non-permanent and seasonal crops; establish a temporary home or construction that can be transferred; public performances such as <b>circus,</b> <b>exhibitions,</b> and others. Some of rules and conditions regarding TOLs are, it cannot be transferred or taken over, terminate when its holders die, can be canceled at any time without any compensation when a breach of the provision is made, and it cannot be used for other purposes apart from what has been stated in the agreement. In accordance with Pahang State Land Administration Directive (Arahan Pentadbiran Tanah Negeri) No. 5 / 1998, approval for new applications, renewal and re-application of TOLs in Cameron Highlands {{is subject to the}} Pahang State Authority. Additionally, the State Authority through the State Executive Council Bil. 25 / 2008 on 30 th July 2008 has decided that the Director of Pahang Lands and Mines Department and District Officer of Cameron Highlands refuse all the new TOLs applications and only process the application for renewal of the existing TOLs (District and Land Office (DLO) Cameron Highlands 2017). Even though no new TOLs was issued, there is new land clearing for farming took place especially in Kampung Raja, Kuala Terla and Manson Valley (Ramasamy 2014). This probably due to poor enforcement and monitoring in the TOLs scheme lead to inappropriate agriculture practices where the TOLs can be rented, bequeathed or sold to others. In 2007, there are 1421 TOLs estimated out of 2500 to 2800 total farms in Cameron Highlands (i.e. some farmers may have more than one TOLs) where 83 % of the farmers acquired the TOLs from the local government while 14 % are land renting (Mazlan and Mumford 2005). The number has increased to 2543 TOLs holders in 2017 where 2041 (80 %) are licensed for agriculture purposes and concentrated in Hulu Telom sub-district (District and Land Office (DLO) Cameron Highlands 2017).|$|R
50|$|A {{possible}} {{origin of}} the mythical elephant is the menagerie or circus. For most Americans, the only chance to see exotic animals was by these types of <b>exhibitions.</b> <b>Circuses</b> were quickly growing in popularity during the early nineteenth century. Several were performing throughout the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and New York City. Often, the big draw for these shows were exotic animals like an elephant. When the circus was traveling, it often drew large crowds along the roadside. These wayside processions were {{the beginning of the}} circus parade. For those that could not afford a ticket to the show, this procession was their only chance at glimpsing exotic animals.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s Knight visited the Bertram Mills Circus at Olympia in West London. Mills' circus {{was a highly}} {{polished}} show with internationally renowned performers. Knight painted some of these performers, such as the clown Whimsical Wilson, several times. Charivari or The Grand Parade, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1929, depicts practically the entire circus cast of performers and animals. Throughout 1929 and 1930 Knight went {{on a tour of}} British towns with the combined Bertram Mills and Great Carmo's Circus. Painting within a working circus forced Knight to paint at great speed, as the performers rarely had much time to pose. Knight responded by painting directly onto the canvas without any preliminary drawing. Whilst this led to some of her circus scenes appearing 'flat', her paintings of small groups of clowns, such as The Three Clowns (1930) and Old Time Clowns (1957), were much more successful. Knight's <b>Circus</b> Folk <b>exhibition,</b> at the Alpine Club in 1930, was heavily criticised in art journals, but her paintings of more mundane subjects, such as domestic interiors and London streets, were highly praised. Notable works from this period include Susie and the Wash-basin (1927), Blue and Gold (1927), A Cottage Bedroom (1929) and Spring in St. John's Wood (1933). In 1934 Knight developed a series of circus designs for the Modern Art for the Table tableware range produced by Clarice Cliff.|$|R
2500|$|Professional wrestling, in {{the sense}} of {{traveling}} performers paid for mass entertainment in staged matches, began in the post-Civil War period in the late 1860s and 1870s. During this time, wrestlers were often athletes with amateur wrestling experience who competed at traveling carnivals with carnies working as their promoters and bookers. Grand <b>circuses</b> included wrestling <b>exhibitions,</b> quickly enhancing them through colorful costumes and fictional biographies for entertainment, disregarding their competitive nature. Wrestling exhibits during the late 19th century were also shown across the United States in countless [...] "athletic shows" [...] (or [...] "at shows"), where experienced wrestlers offered open challenges to the audience. It was at these shows, often done for high-stakes gambling purposes, that the nature of the sport changed through the competing interests of three groups of people: the impresarios, the carnies, and the barnstormers.|$|R
5000|$|Despite similar names, {{the park}} is not {{affiliated}} with Thompson & Dundy's park on Coney Island, New York, USA, or the [...] "Hippodrome". Thompson & Dundy, however, first promoted ideas of franchising in August 1904 but did not file for trademark or copyright protection. Although many types of parks, exhibitions, and entertainment attractions existed at this time, Ingersoll capitalized on standardization, following a formula that characterizes all his [...] "Luna Parks": the first two, in Pittsburgh and Cleveland opened in 1905, a park in Washington, DC and Indianapolis opened {{in the same year}} as Scranton, one in Mexico City the following year, then others, forming the first amusement park chain. Advertising in trade publications, such as The Billboard, Ingersoll sought regional investors with catch-phrases as [...] "We use the best materials, perfect plans, expert builders, and reasonable price. We build for you or build and operate." [...] Construction was standardized, and vaudevillian acts, <b>circus,</b> and other <b>exhibitions</b> were able to be rotated between parks as low-cost entertainment. Parks were designed and built using expertise of his Ingersoll Construction Company employees, then operated by a local company which could acquire services, such as entertainment and technical help, from him.As such, Ingersoll Construction Company with funding of $300,000, designed and constructed the park beginning November 14, 1905. The Scranton Luna Park Company began operating the park on May 28, 1906. Newspaper articles from the Scranton Republican, The Scranton Truth, and other local newspapers suggest a decision to proceed was based on increasing levels of public interest beginning as early as July 17, 1900.|$|R

Live vaudeville acts, <b>exhibitions,</b> <b>circus,</b> and orchestra performances were scheduled as free entertainment complementing patrons' visits. Two of the most successful were appearances of the Knabenshue Toledo No. 2 airship, flown by Aviator Lincoln Beachey, and the world-famous leopard act by Dolores Vallecita.|$|R
40|$|This work {{comprehensively}} {{reviews the}} international trade in sea horses, particularly the Hippocampus genus, from 1997 to 2012. The genus {{was added to the}} Appendices II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (thereinafter as the CITES) in 2002, came into force in 2004. Before the addition, the genus was entered into the appendix D for the non-CITES species whose import is monitored by the EU. The CITES Trade Database kept by the UNEP - WCMC Secretariat was used as the source of data about the trade. The frequency of the trade in sea horses tended to be increasing with a moderate decrease in 2009. The Hippocampus species was traded in the following forms: live, bodies, derivatives, specimens, medicine, carvings, eggs live, extracts, fingerlings, powder, skeletons, skin pieces, soup, trophies and other unspecified forms. The living specimens traded: (1) specimens taken from the wild., (2) animals bred in captivity as well as parts and derivatives, (3) Animals born in captivity (F 1 or subsequent generations) that do not fulfil the definition of 'bred in captivity', as well as parts and derivatives thereof, (4) specimens of animals reared in a controlled environment, taken as eggs or juveniles from the wild, where they would otherwise have had a very low probability of surviving to adulthood, (5) confiscated or seized specimens, (6) pre- Convention specimens. The trades purposes were: (1) commercial, (2) personal, (3) scientific, (4) zoo (aquarium) breeding, (5) educational, (6) breeding in captivity, <b>circus</b> and other <b>exhibitions,</b> (7) conventional medicine, (8) law enforcement / judicial / forensic purposes. The most traded genus was unspecified (Hippocampus spp.), then the H. kuda, the H. reidi and the H. erectus as living specimens or dead bodies; also the ones from the wild and for the commercial purposes. Those came mostly from Vietnam, Thailand or Australia. They were exported mainly from Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Australia. The greatest importers were the USA, Germany and the Great Britain...|$|R
