In 1929 he was also appointed to serve as the first African-American police surgeon with the New York Police Department. In his thirty years at the hospital he started the Harlem Hospital Bulletin, headed the team that first used <b>chlortetracycline</b> on humans, founded the hospital's cancer research center, and earned a reputation as an expert on head injuries.

25|$|When ingested, it {{is usually}} {{recommended}} that the more water-soluble, short-acting tetracyclines (plain tetracycline, <b>chlortetracycline,</b> Oxytetracycline, demeclocycline and methacycline) be taken with a full glass of water, either two hours after eating or two hours before eating. This is partly because most tetracyclines bind with food and also easily with magnesium, aluminium, iron and calcium, which reduces their ability to be completely absorbed by the body. Dairy products, antacids and preparations containing iron should be avoided near the time of taking the drug. Partial exceptions to these rules occur for doxycycline and minocycline, which may be taken with food (though not iron, antacids, or calcium supplements). Minocycline can be taken with dairy products {{because it does not}} chelate calcium as readily, although dairy products do decrease absorption of minocycline slightly.|$|E
25|$|The first {{member of}} the group to be {{discovered}} is <b>chlortetracycline</b> (Aureomycin) in the late 1940s by Benjamin Minge Duggar, a scientist employed by American Cyanamid - Lederle Laboratories, under the leadership of Yellapragada Subbarow, who derived the substance from a golden-colored, fungus-like, soil-dwelling bacterium named Streptomyces aureofaciens. Oxytetracycline (Terramycin) was discovered shortly afterwards by AC Finlay et al.; it came from a similar soil bacterium named Streptomyces rimosus. Robert Burns Woodward determined the structure of oxytetracycline, enabling Lloyd H. Conover to successfully produce tetracycline itself as a synthetic product. The development of many chemically altered antibiotics formed this group. In June 2005, tigecycline, the first member of a new subgroup of tetracyclines named glycylcyclines, was introduced to treat infections that are resistant to other antimicrobics including conventional tetracyclines. While tigecycline is the first tetracycline approved in over 20 years, other, newer versions of tetracyclines are currently in human clinical trials.|$|E

2500|$|After {{penicillin}} {{revolutionized the}} treatment of bacterial infections in WWII, many chemical companies moved into the field of discovering antibiotics by bioprospecting. American Cyanamid was one of these, and in the late 1940s chemists there discovered <b>chlortetracycline,</b> {{the first member of}} the tetracycline class of antibiotics. Shortly thereafter, scientists at Pfizer discovered terramycin and it was brought to market. [...] Both compounds, like penicillin, were natural products and it was commonly believed that nature had perfected them, and further chemical changes could only degrade their effectiveness. [...] Scientists at Pfizer led by Lloyd Conover modified these compounds, which led to the invention of tetracycline itself, the first semi-synthetic antibiotic. Charlie Stephens' group at Pfizer worked on further analogs and created one with greatly improved stability and pharmacological efficacy: doxycycline. [...] It was clinically developed in the early 1960s and approved by the FDA in 1967.|$|E

The risk or severity of adverse effects can be increased when <b>chlortetracycline</b> is combined with acitretin, adapalene, or alitretinoin. Aluminum phosphate and aluminum hydroxide can cause decreases in the absorption of <b>chlortetracycline</b> resulting in a reduced serum concentration and potentially a decrease in efficacy. The therapeutic efficacy of mecillinam (amdinocillin), amoxicillin, and ampicillin can be decreased when used in combination with <b>chlortetracycline.</b> <b>Chlortetracycline</b> {{may increase}} the neuromuscular blocking activities of atracurium besilate.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{completion}} of his studies, Conover joined Pfizer's chemical research department. He {{was part of}} a team exploring the molecular architecture of the broad-spectrum antibiotics Terramycin and Aureomycin. Both of these drugs had been discovered as natural products produced by actinomycetes. Working in conjunction with Harvard Professor R.B. Woodward, the team began to recognize {{that it was possible to}} chemically alter an antibiotic to produce other antibiotics that were effective in treating various types of illnesses. In 1952, he developed tetracycline in this way. Specifically, he was able to produce tetracycline by dechlorinating Aureomycin by catalytic reduction, that is, by substituting hydrogen for chlorine in <b>chlortetracycline.</b> His success led to the process being used to produce other superior structurally modified antibiotics. This is a standard practice in the industry today.|$|E

50|$|Exposure to {{antibiotics}} {{early in}} life is associated with increased body mass in humans and mouse models. Early life is a critical period {{for the establishment of}} the intestinal microbiota and for metabolic development. Mice exposed to subtherapeutic antibiotic treatment (STAT)- with either penicillin, vancomycin, or <b>chlortetracycline</b> had altered composition of the gut microbiota as well as its metabolic capabilities. One study has reported that mice given low-dose penicillin (1 μg/g body weight) around birth and throughout the weaning process had an increased body mass and fat mass, accelerated growth, and increased hepatic expression of genes involved in adipogenesis, compared to control mice. In addition, penicillin in combination with a high-fat diet increased fasting insulin levels in mice. However, it is unclear whether or not antibiotics cause obesity in humans. Studies have found a correlation between early exposure of antibiotics (<6 months) and increased body mass (at 10 and 20 months). Another study found that the type of antibiotic exposure was also significant with the highest risk of being overweight in those given macrolides compared to penicillin and cephalosporin. Therefore, there is correlation between antibiotic exposure in early life and obesity in humans, but {{whether or not there is}} a causal relationship remains unclear. Although there is a correlation between antibiotic use in early life and obesity, the effect of antibiotics on obesity in humans needs to be weighed against the beneficial effects of clinically indicated treatment with antibiotics in infancy.|$|E

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of NADH or succinate by Jerusalem-artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) mitochondria in {{the presence}} of <b>chlortetracycline</b> induced an increase in <b>chlortetracycline</b> fluorescence. Any treatment that prevented the formation of a transmembrane potential (as monitored by changes in safranine absorbance, A 511 -A 533), e. g. uncoupling with carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, inhibition of dehydrogenase activity or electron transport, anaerobiosis or depletion of substrate, prevented the increase in <b>chlortetracycline</b> fluorescence or caused it to disappear. Changes in <b>chlortetracycline</b> fluorescence were always slower than changes in the safranine absorbance. The increase in <b>chlortetracycline</b> fluorescence caused by succinate oxidation had an excitation maximum at 393 nm, indicating that a Ca 2 +-chlortetracycline complex was involved. The increase in fluorescence was observed even {{in the presence}} of EDTA, which removes all external bivalent cations, indicating that internal Ca 2 + is mobilized. Although NADH and succinate oxidations gave the same membrane potential and qualitatively had the same effect on <b>chlortetracycline</b> fluorescence, NADH oxidation caused a much larger (over 3 -fold) increase in <b>chlortetracycline</b> fluorescence than did succinate oxidation.

After 12 days of incubation, the sulfamethazine biodegradation was observed whereas <b>chlortetracycline</b> was persistent.
