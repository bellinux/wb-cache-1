This block marked the return to the plane of Mirrodin. This plane was last visited in the Mirrodin block that concluded in 2004. The interim tagline for the set was [...] "The Corrosion Begins October 1, 2010." [...] The plans for this set were first made public by mananation.com when {{it was discovered that}} [...] "Scars of Mirrodin", as well as [...] "Mirrodin Pure" [...] and [...] "New Phyrexia" [...] had been registered as trademarks with the US Patent and Trademark Office by Wizards of the Coast. [...] As with the original Mirrodin block, artifacts make up the overarching theme of Scars of Mirrodin; Nearly half of all cards in the set are artifacts. In his May 24 <b>column,</b> <b>Mark</b> Rosewater confirmed that the [...] "Infect" [...] game mechanic in Scars of Mirrodin would bring poison counters back to Magic. All cards (other than basic lands) in the Scars of Mirrodin block carried a watermark, either Mirran or Phyrexian.|$|E
