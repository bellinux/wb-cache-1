The State Duma Defense Committee has announced that the nation's defense spending, including research and development R spending, will total $16.3 billion (RUB487 billion) in 2010, $19.2 billion (RUB574 billion) in 2011, $24.3 billion (RUB726 billion) in 2012, and $38.8 billion (RUB1.16 trillion) in 2013. While total defense spending will increase, the amount allocated for R will drop from the current 2010 level of 22 percent to 16 percent by 2013. The modernization of weaponry will instead receive a significant portion of total spending, with 13 percent designated for the 2010 fiscal year, 15 percent for 2011 and 2012, and 14 percent for 2013. The top procurement priorities are the following: RS-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles, Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missiles, Su-24 fighters, Su-35 long-range fighters, submarines, corvettes, frigates, and battlefield command-and-control systems. The plan for 2010-2013 only represents a small portion (16%) of that amount, just over RUB2.9 trillion ($98.6 billion). The government intends to spend RUB19 trillion ($613 billion) over the next decade to modernize the armed forces.|$|E

30|$|There are {{two main}} {{approaches}} to tackle freight parking congestion: one is improving the parking supply through infrastructure investments; the second one is to influence freight parking demand through policies and regulations such that the existing infrastructure is better utilised and congestion is lessened. To support the first approach, cities’ authorities often provide guidelines and regulations {{for the construction of}} adequate freight parking infrastructure. For instance, at least one loading/unloading bay for every 4000  m 2 of retail area is required in Singapore [3]; in the UK the requirement is set at a minimum of one lorry space per 750  m 2 of retail space [4]. The second approach consists of implementing urban logistics initiatives, i.e. policies and regulations enacted by the public sector to foster sustainable logistics practices [5].

The deliveries of civilian aircraft increased to 6 in 2005, and in 2009 the industry delivered 15 civilian aircraft, worth 12.5 billion roubles, mostly to domestic customers. Since then Russia has successfully tested the fifth generation jet fighter, Sukhoi Su-57, and started the commercial production of the regional airliner Sukhoi Superjet 100, as well as started developing a number of other major projects. Putin created the United Shipbuilding Corporation in 2007, which led to the recovery of shipbuilding in Russia. Since 2006, much efforts were put into consolidation and development of the Rosatom Nuclear Energy State Corporation, which led to the renewed construction of nuclear power plants in Russia as well as a vast activity of Rosatom abroad, buying huge shares in world's leading uranium production companies and building nuclear power plants in many countries, including India, Iran, China, Vietnam and Belarus. In 2007, the Russian Nanotechnology Corporation was established, aimed to boost the science and technology and high-tech industry in Russia. The gist of the new system is to encourage industry to continually reduce manufacturing expenses and improve resource management. Manufacturer profits are made directly dependent on savings it achieves during the series production of modern weapons. This requires more effective resource management, cutting manufacturing costs and making production more economically efficient.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographyThe global {{economic}} recession which affected {{most of the}} Caribbean would have been less severe if policymakers were {{in a position to}} sustain fiscal stimulus packages for a longer duration. This paper argues that while the crisis aggravated the debt and fiscal situation, the negative fiscal and current account balances reflected long standing issues related to declining competitiveness. To address the challenging fiscal situation, a number of countries are pursuing fiscal <b>consolidation</b> <b>programmes,</b> many of which imply expenditure cuts and revenue increases. Implicit in such programmes is that the current account deficits are due to fiscal deficits and, consequently, in some countries fiscal responsibility laws are being enacted. To address the question as to whether the current account balances cause the fiscal balance or vice versa, Granger causality tests were employed. In addition, the proportion of the variance due to the shock from one variable to another is examined using a vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) framework.

The study {{contributes to the}} literature by combining individual-country analysis with recent panel data approaches for robustness of results. Our results support existence of long-run relationship between government revenues and expenditures for the countries in a specification allowing for unknown structural break. The size of slope parameter obtained from Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares is however significantly less than one except for Bangladesh indicating incoherence with ‘strong’ sustainability of deficits. The long run causality analysis lends support to ‘spend-tax hypothesis’ for India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Srilanka and ‘tax- spend hypothesis’ in case of Nepal. From perspective of design of fiscal <b>consolidation</b> <b>programmes,</b> this implies that adjustment of revenues would be optimal solution to control spending in Nepal while control of expenditure would be effective in case of India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Srilanka.

40|$|The Eurozone {{crisis has}} given a new impetus to {{academic}} and policy debates about the merits and ills of fiscal consolidation policies (austerity). Fuelled by the huge contraction experienced by some ‘bailout countries’, and especially Greece, a new consensus seems to have emerged, that “austerity doesn’t work”. Yet, many Eurozone countries have seen a relatively fruitful implementation of fiscal <b>consolidation</b> <b>programmes,</b> with fiscal pressures being successfully curtailed and the adverse growth effects of austerity being very short-lived. The literature has only recently shifted its attention to the qualitative characteristics of fiscal consolidation to explain variations in economic performance (growth) across countries {{in the course of}} austerity. Still, attention to political-institutional and structural-economic factors is generally lacking. This paper makes a contribution in this direction, by showing that two domestic-context parameters – trade openness and quality of government – exert significant influence on the impact that austerity has on growth and debt-sustainability. Factoring-in these parameters allows us to contextualise a number of ‘stylised facts’ of the Eurozone crisis, including the huge recession and large snowball effect for Greece, the relatively painless fiscal consolidation in parts of the Eurozone north, and the surprising decline in nominal interest rates seen is some of the most agile Eurozone countries...|$|R

By applying a number of econometric methods including Asymmetric Error Correction Models, Mean Adjustment Lag (MAL) models and Autoregressive Distributed Lag models on monthly data for the period 1994 - 2007, the study found some evidence of a relationship between bank concentration and IRPT in all four countries.
