40|$|Tissue-specific {{manipulation}} of known copper transport genes in Drosophila tissues results in phenotypes that are presumably {{due to an}} alteration in copper levels in the targeted cells. However direct confirmation of this has to date been technically challenging. Measures of cellular copper content such as expression levels of copper-responsive genes or <b>cuproenzyme</b> <b>activity</b> levels, while useful, are indirect. First-generation copper-sensitive fluorophores show promise but currently lack the sensitivity required to detect subtle changes in copper levels. Moreover such techniques do not provide information regarding other relevant biometals such as zinc or iron. Traditional techniques for measuring elemental composition such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy are not sensitive enough for use with the small tissue amounts available in Drosophila research. Here we present synchrotron x-ray fluorescence microscopy analysis of two different Drosophila tissues, the larval wing imaginal disc, and sectioned adult fly heads and show that this technique can b...|$|E
40|$|Menkes {{disease and}} {{occipital}} horn syndrome (OHS) are allelic, X-linked recessive copper-deficiency disorders resulting from mutations in ATP 7 A, or MNK. Classic Menkes disease has a severe phenotype, with death in early childhood, whereas OHS has a milder phenotype, with, mainly, connective-tissue abnormalities. Data suggest that steady-state localization of ATP 7 A to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) {{is necessary for}} proper activity of lysyl oxidase, which is the predominant <b>cuproenzyme</b> whose <b>activity</b> is deficient in OHS and which is essential for maintenance of connective-tissue integrity. Recently, {{it was reported that}} ATP 7 A-transcript levels as low as 2 %â€“ 5 % of normal are sufficient to result in the milder phenotype, OHS, rather than the phenotype of Menkes disease. In contrast to previously reported cases of OHS, we describe a case of OHS in which, because of a frameshift mutation, no normal ATP 7 A is produced. Although abundant levels of mutant transcript are present, there are substantially reduced levels of the truncated protein, which lacks the key dileucine motif L 1487 L 1488. It has been demonstrated that the dileucine motif L 1487 L 1488 functions as an endocytic signal for ATP 7 A cycling between the TGN and the plasma membrane. The present report is the first to describe an ATP 7 A truncation that results in OHS rather than in Menkes disease. The data from the present report support the concepts that (1) OHS results from lower levels of functional ATP 7 A and (2) ATP 7 A does not require the dileucine motif to function in copper efflux...|$|R
