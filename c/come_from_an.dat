5|$|Charles Guinand Blackader {{was born}} in Richmond, Surrey on 20 September 1869. His father, Charles George Blackader, was a teacher to {{a small number of}} {{boarding}} pupils; he had <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> Army family, and taught at Cheltenham College and Clifton College, Bristol, before moving to private tuition. His mother, Charlotte Guinand, {{was born in}} Germany; her family may have come from Alsace-Lorraine, as Blackader would later describe himself as half-French. During his childhood, the Blackaders moved from Richmond to Southampton, where his father headed the education department at the Hartley Institute, and then to Boulogne, where he taught at Beaurepaire School.|$|E
5|$|Ragtime was a {{style of}} dance music based around the piano, using syncopated rhythms and chromaticisms; the genre's most {{well-known}} performer and composer was undoubtedly Scott Joplin. Donald Clarke considers ragtime the culmination of coon songs, used first in minstrel shows and then vaudeville, {{and the result of}} the rhythms of minstrelsy percolating into the mainstream; he also suggests that ragtime's distinctive sound may have <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> attempt to imitate the African American banjo using the keyboard.|$|E
5000|$|Of the ten {{types of}} women in the poem, nine are {{delineated}} as destructive: the dirty woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> pig; the cunning woman originates <b>from</b> <b>a</b> fox, the incessantly curious and high-maintenance woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> dog, the lazy or apathetic woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> earth or soil, the capricious woman of mood swings <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> seawater, the stubborn woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> ass, the untrustworthy and uncontrollable woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> ferret, the overly proud woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> mare, and the worst and ugliest type of woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> ape or monkey. Only the [...] "Bee Woman" [...] is regarded as virtuous. The bee reference is considered homage to the earlier poem of Hesiod entitled Theogony, which uses the metaphor of women and men as bees in one part.|$|R

5|$|The MSE {{method is}} also {{sensitive}} to secondary clustering. One {{example of this}} phenomenon is when a set of observations is thought {{to come from a}} single normal distribution, but in fact comes from a mixture normals with different means. A second example is when the data is thought to <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> exponential distribution, but actually comes from a gamma distribution. In the latter case, smaller spacings may occur in the lower tail. A high value of M(θ) would indicate this secondary clustering effect, and suggesting {{a closer look at the}} data is required.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into two parts. The first part, Epiphany, {{consists}} of eight chapters and focuses on the roots, development, and impact of the Scottish Enlightenment on Scotland and Great Britain. The roots <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> appreciation for democracy and literacy that developed from the Scottish Reformation, when John Knox brought Calvinist Presbyterianism to Scotland. He preached that God ordained power into the people and that it was for the people to administer and enforce God's laws, not the monarchy. For common people to understand God's laws they {{had to be able to}} read the Bible, so schools were built in every parish and literacy rates grew rapidly, creating a Scottish-oriented market for books and writers.|$|E
5|$|The hindlimbs of Patagosaurus {{are based}} on scant material, some femora, a tibia, and a few nondescript pedal bones. Two femora <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> adult, with a single {{additional}} bone known from the juvenile. The adult femora are proportionately different from the juvenile, being mostly straighter and more ovoid in cross-section. The femoral head is well preserved, although lacking the greater trochanter. The distal end is rather symmetrical when viewed from behind, with two similarly sized condylar surfaces. In the juvenile, the fourth trochanter is completely in the proximal end. The tibia has a well-developed cnemial crest, and is also short and robust. The surface that would have articulated with the astragalus in life has the anterior half raised, and the posterior half lowered.|$|E
50|$|There are two genetic traits {{linked to}} feline {{cutaneous}} asthenia. One <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> dominant allele, {{while the other}} <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> recessive. Both result similar pathology.|$|R

5000|$|The album's name <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> lyric in [...] "My Unbroken Reflection". The lyric <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> sound {{recording}} clip of a lecture spoken by drummer Colin Frangicietto's college teacher.|$|R
5|$|Bach, the Thomaskantor in Leipzig from May 1723, {{composed}} this cantata {{to complete}} his second cantata cycle of chorale cantatas, begun in 1724. He used the lyrics of the hymn unchanged, which reflect the psalm and Jesus as the Good Shepherd. Bach structured the work in five movements. The outer choral movements are a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, both on the hymn tune. Bach set the inner stanzas as aria – recitative – aria, with music unrelated to the hymn tune. He scored the cantata for four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns, two oboes d'amore, strings and continuo. Bach scholars agree that the brass instruments, normally reserved for Feast days, could <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> earlier chorale fantasia of the same melody with {{the text of the}} German Gloria.|$|E
5|$|During final testing, {{engineers}} detected {{that the}} spacecraft's X band (NATO H/I/J bands) communications antenna was transmitting {{only a tiny}} fraction of the power that it should. Thermal imaging showed that the waveguide to the antenna, deep inside the spacecraft, was very hot. Clearly that was where the missing power was being dissipated. The waveguide could not normally be inspected or repaired without major disassembly of the satellite, which would have required a return to the facilities in Europe and resulted in a major delay to the launch. To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of ferrite were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that the ferrite had <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> absorption load installed deep inside the antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.|$|E
5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes and another observer {{on either side of}} him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands was placed {{on the top of the}} table, and the other inside the cage which held an accordion on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light in the room was not stated, and {{the accordion}} was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E
50|$|The town name <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{pastoral}} property, {{which in}} turn <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> Aboriginal word for 'honey person'. The first European to visit the district was John Oxley who traced {{the course of the}} Macquarie River in 1818.|$|R
50|$|The name Vailulu'u <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Samoan story {{related to}} the sacred {{sprinkling}} of rain associated with gatherings for the Tui Manu'a paramount chiefs of Manu'a Island. The name <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> American Samoa student Taulealo Vaofusi, the winner of a naming competition.|$|R

5|$|The {{magnitude}} and ferocity of the German Ardennes Offensive {{came as a}} shock and Strong was criticised for failing to predict it. However Smith defended Strong against criticism for failing to sound the alarm, feeling that Strong have given ample warning, which had been discounted or disregarded by himself and others. By 19 December, Strong had become concerned that the Germans were going to split Bradley's armies, and he and Whiteley – who had already received Monty's opinion on the matter – went to Smith, recommending that the armies north of the Ardennes be transferred from Bradley to Montgomery's command. Smith realised the military and political implications of this, and knew that such a recommendation had to <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> American officer. On 20 December, Smith spoke to Eisenhower, who deferred judgement until the morning staff meeting. Eisenhower then phoned Bradley and Montgomery and ordered it. The decision was greatly resented by many Americans, particularly at 12th Army Group.|$|E

25|$|When the {{observations}} <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> exponential family and mild conditions are satisfied, least-squares estimates and maximum-likelihood estimates are identical. The {{method of least squares}} {{can also be}} derived as a method of moments estimator.|$|E
25|$|The words medos, a {{beverage}} akin to mead, kamos, a barley drink, and strava, {{a funeral}} feast, are of satemised Indo-European origin. They {{may be of}} Slavic, but also Germanic and Iranian origin. Maenchen-Helfen argued that strava may have <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> informant who spoke Slavic.|$|E
25|$|Bactrian {{documents}} - in the Bactrian language, {{written from}} the fourth to eighth centuries - consistently evoke the name of local deities, such as Kamird and Wakhsh, for example, as witnesses to contracts.

25|$|Punto guajiro or Punto Cubano, {{or simply}} Punto is a sung genre of Cuban music, an improvised poetic-music art {{that emerged in}} the western and central regions of Cuba during the 17th century. Although Punto appears to <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> Andalusian origin, it is a true Cuban genre because of its creole modifications.|$|E
25|$|The stable normal bundle is {{the class}} of normal bundles plus trivial bundles, and thus if the stable normal bundle has cohomological {{dimension}} k, it cannot <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> (unstable) normal bundle of dimension less than k. Thus, the cohomology dimension of the stable normal bundle, as detected by its highest non-vanishing characteristic class, is an obstruction to immersions.|$|E
