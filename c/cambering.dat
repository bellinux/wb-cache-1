50|$|Of {{the major}} protagonists in the Legends of <b>Camber</b> of Culdi trilogy, <b>Camber</b> {{is clearly the}} leader. While {{characters}} such as Joram, Evaine, and Rhys often defer to his patriarchal authority, <b>Camber's</b> other colleagues and allies respond to his intelligence, experience, and keen analytical judgment. Although others share in his goals and objectives, it is <b>Camber's</b> actions and decisions that have {{the greatest impact on}} the overall social and political events in the novels. When Rhys and Joram discover the existence of a Haldane heir in <b>Camber</b> of Culdi, one of their first actions is to seek <b>Camber's</b> guidance on the matter, and it is ultimately <b>Camber's</b> participation in the plot (specifically giving Deryni-like powers to Cinhil) that enables it to succeed. In Saint <b>Camber,</b> <b>Camber's</b> assumption of Alister Cullen's identity allows him to befriend Cinhil and provide the guidance the new king needs to become a successful ruler. And after Cinhil's death in <b>Camber</b> the Heretic, <b>Camber</b> continues to use his Cullen identity to provide invaluable leadership to the developing Deryni resistance movement. While <b>Camber</b> rarely works alone in his endeavors, it is often his counsel and direction that the other protagonists follow.|$|R
50|$|<b>Camber</b> {{is also a}} {{character}} {{in two of the}} short stories that were published in the book The Deryni Archives. In Catalyst, set fifteen years before <b>Camber</b> of Culdi, <b>Camber</b> appears only briefly {{at the very end of}} the story to congratulate a young Rhys on his newly discovered Healing talents. In Healer's Song, set between the events of Saint <b>Camber</b> and <b>Camber</b> the Heretic, <b>Camber</b> takes part in an intimate family ritual after the birth of his newest grandson, Tieg Thuryn.|$|R
50|$|A {{recurrent}} complaint from Apollo owners was {{the usage}} of steel rod-operated gear shift instead of the commonly used cable-operated gear shift. Both Verona and Apollo had <b>cambering</b> issues as well, partially due to rear suspension's project that was not adequately designed for a saloon.|$|E
50|$|Also unlike Telford {{and other}} road builders, McAdam laid his roads as level as possible.

50|$|Natural slopes in the Wadhurst Clay, {{like those}} in the Ashdown Formation, are known for their instability, {{especially}} where impermeable clays and impermeable silts and siltstones are interbedded.

Other common features include <b>cambering,</b> valley bulging and solifluction lobes.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{the course}} of The Legends of <b>Camber</b> of Culdi, <b>Camber</b> is in {{conflict}} with the Festillic rulers of Gwynedd, King Imre Furstán-Festil and his sister, Princess Ariella. <b>Camber</b> has a strained relationship with King Cinhil Haldane, who blames <b>Camber</b> for taking him from his priestly vocation. Many of <b>Camber's</b> decisions result in heated arguments with his son, Joram. By the end of the trilogy, <b>Camber</b> is in danger from the ambitious human nobles and priests who seek to suppress Deryni throughout Gwynedd.|$|R
50|$|<b>Camber</b> {{returns to}} Valoret with the victorious Gwyneddan army, {{but he is}} {{increasingly}} plagued by headaches from Cullen's memories, which he must assimilate into his own memories {{if he is to}} avoid madness. Evaine, Rhys, and Joram assist <b>Camber</b> in the necessary procedure, but they are interrupted by the arrival of the king. Unable to stop the process, <b>Camber's</b> disguise momentarily slips, leaving Cinhil stunned by the brief appearance of the supposedly dead <b>Camber.</b> Nonetheless, Evaine and <b>Camber</b> complete the procedure, which allows <b>Camber</b> to better perform his public role as Cullen. The following night, <b>Camber</b> again drops his disguise long enough to appear as a vision to his despondent former squire, Lord Guaire d'Arliss. <b>Camber</b> spends much of the next week fulfilling the role of Vicar General of the Michaelines, but it is Cullen's impending promotion to Bishop of Grecotha that concerns him most. The night before the ceremony, at Joram's behest, <b>Camber</b> reveals his identity to his old friend Archbishop Anscom of Valoret. Anscom agrees to consecrate <b>Camber</b> as a priest, which will enable him to legally perform the duties of a bishop. In {{the early hours of the}} morning, Anscom ordains <b>Camber</b> in the presence of his children, and <b>Camber</b> becomes Bishop of Grecotha later that day.|$|R

50|$|The Trikke {{was invented}} by Brazilian born {{engineer}} Gildo Beleski circa 1988. He had built a three wheeled scooter for riding downhill and discovered that once reaching {{the bottom of the}} hill, the scooter would continue further if he turned it left and right.

40|$|Inaccurate {{prediction}} of long-term <b>camber</b> in precast prestressed concrete beams (PPCB) creates discrepancies in bridge construction {{which results in}} increased costs and construction challenges. Although {{emphasis is placed on}} erection and long-term <b>camber,</b> these challenges have been found to originate from the difference between the estimated design and measured <b>camber</b> at the transfer of prestress and will continue to increase with time. The estimate of the instantaneous <b>camber</b> is influenced by factors such as the method used for determining the <b>camber</b> as well as the assumed modulus of elasticity and initial prestress, while the measured <b>camber</b> can be affected by the measurement technique, quality of formwork and construction, and uniformity of concrete. To systematically study and eliminate the construction challenges associated with <b>camber</b> of precast girders, a research project was undertaken to examine the differences between the measured and designed <b>camber</b> of Iowa girders from fabrication through erection. This thesis focuses on the causes of error found with instantaneous <b>camber</b> by examining the designer 2 ̆ 7 s prediction method and variables used for design, the construction practices used for producing a PPCB, and the precasters <b>camber</b> measurement method adopted by the precast industry. While the discrepancy between the measured and designed <b>camber</b> was found to be dependent on the girder type, the designed <b>camber</b> was underestimated due to inaccurate variables used for material properties and the design prestress force. In depth analysis was conducted to investigate different methods of <b>camber</b> prediction and to determine the effects that material properties have on <b>camber.</b> Evaluation of the historical <b>camber</b> measurements that were previously recorded using the current measurement technique revealed that <b>camber</b> is over predicted the majority of the time. Further examination of historical data exposed insufficient data that did not accurately capture the instantaneous <b>camber.</b> For this reason, precasters fabrication procedures were observed and instantaneous <b>camber</b> was measured by the project team from over 100 girders. Observations and independent <b>camber</b> measurements taken by the research team led to the identification of discrepancies between predicted and measured instantaneous <b>camber.</b> Results found that friction, bed deflections, inconsistent top flange surfaces due to the finish that is applied, and inconsistent top flange surfaces due to the beam depth not being uniform {{along the length of the}} beam currently produce an average error of 17. 6...|$|R

Butcher's gambrels, later made of metal, resembled the two-sloped appearance of a gambrel roof when in use. Gambrel is also a term for the joint in the upper part of a horse's hind leg, the hock.|$|E
50|$|Work at {{the quarry}} ceased in the 1940s {{and the site}} is {{currently}} owned by Loose Scouts Group.

Although abandoned, there is still some evidence of quarry working, such as a central over-burden roadway, overburden and spoil dumps. The rock face is a good example of ragstone and hassock layering together with others less common features resulting from <b>cambering</b> towards Loose Valley, such as jointing, faulting and gulls.|$|E

His 30 ft road {{required}} only {{a rise of}} three inches from the edges to the center. <b>Cambering</b> and elevation of the road above the water table enabled rainwater to run off into ditches on either side. Size of stones was central to the McAdam's road building theory. The lower 200 mm road thickness was restricted to stones no larger than 75 mm. The upper 50 mm layer of stones was limited to 20 mm size and stones were checked by supervisors who carried scales. A workman could check the stone size himself by seeing if the stone would fit into his mouth. The importance of the 20 mm stone size was that the stones needed to be {{much smaller than the}} 100 mm width of the iron carriage tyres that traveled on the road. Macadam roads were being built widely in the United States and Australia in the 1820s and in Europe in the 1830s and 1840s.|$|E

The surface at the time was strong enough to accept the Boeing 707 at maximum gross weight, although 15,000 ft rather than 10,000 ft length was the probable all-weather length requirement. There was no physical limit to extending the paved length to this figure, but more definite plans for the operation of the big jets into Kenya was required before such an increase was contemplated.|$|E
50|$|Of course {{things should}} be the same, left and right, for road cars. <b>Camber</b> affects {{steering}} because a tire generates a force towards the side that the top is leaning towards.

40|$|MasterIn {{hot rolling}} process, <b>camber</b> {{is one of}} the most {{significant}} defects where <b>camber</b> is flatness asymmetries produced by non-uniform distribution of rolling pressure. This kind of defect may cause not only the clogging of finishing mill, but also visible defects such as strip edge folds, edge cracks, holes, and scrapes in the process. In order to reduce <b>camber</b> for hot rolled steel strips, it is important to measure the exact <b>camber</b> value with information of the overall shape. This paper describes a computer vision system with new algorithm for obtaining the optimal cutting line, overall strip shape, and <b>camber</b> value from two area scan Charge Coupled Cameras (CCD) in hot rolling process. The proposed algorithm consists of three parts: cutting line detection, image stitching, and <b>camber</b> detection. The cutting line detection part determines the optimal cutting line of the head and tail part of strip for endless hot rolling process. The image stitching part obtains the overall shape of a hot rolled steel strip with continuous image sequence obtained by two area scan cameras. The <b>camber</b> detection part measures head <b>camber,</b> tail <b>camber,</b> and whole <b>camber</b> of the steel strip. Through the proposed algorithm, the system satisfies time constraints for detecting the <b>camber</b> of the steel strip...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the addition of}} camber to a previously published semi-empirical tyre model by the same authors. The model combines empirical models for pure braking, cornering and <b>cambering</b> with a model for simultaneous braking, cornering and <b>cambering.</b> It is based on brush-model tyre mechanics and aims to offer an easy-to-use accurate model for vehicle-handling simulations. The proposed model is a method to extract and rescale the adhesion and sliding forces from empirical pure-slip tyre models {{to account for the}} combined-slip condition. The combined-slip self-aligning torque is described likewise. <b>Cambering</b> affects the natural path of the tyre carcass on the road surface and deforms the threads to produce an additional force in the lateral direction. Thereby, the proportions of the sliding and adhesive forces changes. The model is computationally sound and efficient and does not rely on any additional parameters that depend on combined-slip data for calibration. It can be used in combination with virtually any empirical pure-slip model...|$|E
30|$|RC beams {{strengthened}} with Fe-SMA strips were deflected downward by {{thermal expansion}} of the heated Fe-SMA strip.

The prestressing force acted as compression to the tension region of the concrete, which generated the <b>cambering</b> effect. The ultimate upward displacements at mid-span of the strengthened RC beams by the <b>cambering</b> effect were 0.205, 0.218, 0.443, and 0.625  mm, respectively, for SL- 60 S- 2, SL- 30 S- 4, SL- 60 S- 4, and SL- 90 S- 4.|$|E
