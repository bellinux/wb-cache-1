The treatments comprised of two chilli genotypes (cv. Byadagi kaddi and Hy. 9646) with Jayadhar cotton as mixed crop (main plot) and six intercrops viz., soybean, french bean, coriander (vegetable), coriander (seeds), garlic and onion (sub-plot). High yielding chilli genotype Hy. 9646 recorded 1013 kg per ha dry chilli yield accounting for 37. 4 per cent increase over chilli cv. Byadagi (737. 0 kg/ha). The chilli genotype Hy. 9646 recorded significantly higher total dry matter production at 30 (4. 21 g/plant), 60 (39. 71 g/plant), 90 (116. 47 g/plant) and 120 (161. 31 g/plant) DAT. Intercropping of coriander (vegetable) with chilli + cotton recorded significantly higher dry chilli yield (1122 kg/ha). Intercropping coriander (vegetable) recorded significantly higher kapas yield (580 kg/ha). Kapas yield per ha and total DMP per plant at 150 DAS of cotton was influenced by interaction effects of growing different intercrops with chilli (cv. Byadagi) + cotton or with chilli (Hy. 9646) + cotton. The higher total DMP and yield of chilli and cotton were due to higher LA, LAI, LAD, AGR, RGR, NAR and CGR. Growing chilli genotype cv.

Conservation agriculture (CA) based best-bet crop management practices may increase crop and water productivity, while conserving and sustaining natural resources. In a 6 -year study of conservation agriculture experiment established in 2008, we have evaluated the performance of CA-based management practices [permanent bed (PB) and zero tillage (ZT) ] and conventional till (CT) for four intensified irrigated maize systems [maize-wheat-mungbean (MWMb), maize-chickpea-Sesbania green manure (MCS), maize-mustard-mungbean (MMuMb) and maize-maize-Sesbania (MMS) ]. Significant (P < 0. 05) tillage and cropping system interactions were observed for system productivity. Agronomic performance (yield attributes) of all the crops (except wheat) grown in sequence with maize was maximum with ZT, however wheat outperformed on PB over ZT and CT. In the initial two years, higher system productivity (maize <b>equivalent</b> <b>yield)</b> was recorded in PB (8. 2 – 8. 5 Mg ha− 1), while from third year onwards ZT registered maximum productivity (11. 3 – 12. 9 Mg ha− 1).

Economic profits from maize-based rotations were invariably higher either in MMuMb or MWMb systems, while in terms of glucose <b>equivalent</b> <b>yield,</b> MMS and MWMb rotation were highest. Synergistic effects of summer legumes (mungbean and Sesbania) after winter legume/oilseed/cereal were observed on yield of individual crop vis-a-vis system productivity and irrigation water use.
