This space consists of all q = (q 1, [...] .,qn) ∈ X n such that no m+ 1 of the points q 1, [...] .,qn belong to a hyperplane in X. In particular, we show that for n big enough any holomorphic map f: E n (<b>CP</b> <b>m,</b> gp) → E n (<b>CP</b> <b>m,</b> gp) commuting with the natural action of the symmetric group S(n) in E n (<b>CP</b> <b>m,</b> gp) is of the form f(q) = τ(q) q = (τ(q) q 1, [...] .,τ(q) qn), q ∈ E n (<b>CP</b> <b>m,</b> gp), where τ: E n (<b>CP</b> <b>m,</b> gp) → PSL(m + 1, C) is an S(n) -invariant holomorphic map.

40|$|Modern {{parallel}} file systems achieve {{high performance}} {{using a variety}} of techniques, such as striping files across multiple disks to increase aggregate I/O bandwidth and spreading disks across multiple servers to increase aggregate interconnect bandwidth. To achieve peak performance from such systems, it is typically necessary to utilize multiple concurrent readers/writers from multiple systems to overcome various singlesystem limitations, such as number of processors and network bandwidth. The standard <b>cp</b> and <b>md</b> 5 sum tools of GNU coreutils found on every modern Unix/Linux system, however, utilize a single execution thread on a single CPU core of a single system, and hence cannot take full advantage of the increased performance of clustered file systems. Mcp and msum are drop-in replacements for the standard <b>cp</b> and <b>md</b> 5 sum programs that utilize multiple types of parallelism and other optimizations to achieve maximum copy and checksum performance on clustered file systems. Multi-threading is used to ensure that nodes are kept as busy as possible. Read/write parallelism allows individual operations of a single copy to be overlapped using asynchronous I/O. Multinode cooperation allows different nodes {{to take part in the}} same copy/checksum. Split-file processing allows multiple threads to operate concurrently on the same file. Finally, hash trees allow inherently serial checksums to be performed in parallel. Mcp and msum provide significant performance improvements over standard <b>cp</b> and <b>md</b> 5 sum using multiple types of parallelism and other optimizations. The total speed-ups from all improvements are significant. Mcp improves cp performance over 27 x, msum improves md 5 sum performance almost 19 x, and the combination of mcp and msum improves verified copies via <b>cp</b> and <b>md</b> 5 sum by almost 22 x.

First-order optical properties {{are driven by}} particle concentration with best predictions of [SPM] by b(bp) and b(s), and of [AC] by c(p). Second-order variability is investigated with respect to particle size, apparent density (dry weight-to-wet-volume ratio), and composition. Overall, the mass-specific particulate backscattering coefficient, b(bp) (m) (5 bbp : [SPM]), is relatively well constrained, with variability of a factor of 3 - 4. This coefficient is well correlated with particle composition, with inorganic particles having values about three times greater (b(bp) (m) = 0. 012 m 2 g 21) than organic particles (b(bp) (m) = 0. 005 m 2 g 21). The mass-specific particulate attenuation coefficient, <b>c(p)</b> (<b>m)</b> (=cp : [SPM]), on the other hand, varies over one order of magnitude and is strongly driven (77 % of the variability explained) by particle apparent density. In this data set particle size does not affect <b>c(p)</b> (<b>m)</b> and affects b(bp) (m) only weakly in clear (case 1) waters, despite size variations over one order of magnitude. A significant fraction (40 - 60 %) of the variability in b m bp remains unexplained.
