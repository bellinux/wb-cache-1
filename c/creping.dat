50|$|A Yankee dryer is a {{pressure}} vessel {{used in the}} production of tissue paper. On the Yankee dryer, the paper goes from approximately 42-45% dryness to just over 89% dryness. In industry, MG cylinders or Yankee dryers are primarily used to remove excess moisture from pulp that is about to be converted into paper. The Yankee cylinder can be equipped with a doctor blade and sprayed with adhesives to make the paper stick. <b>Creping</b> is done by the Yankee's doctor blade that is scraping the dry paper off the cylinder surface thereby <b>crêping</b> the paper.

50|$|The {{usage of}} a {{chemical}} coating {{on the surface of}} the yankee is nowadays the rule. This is constituted by a mixture of usually 2 or more constituents: 1) a base polymer (adhesive) based on polyammides or epichlorhydrine resins which coats the surface of the yankee with a polymer layer in which the <b>creping</b> blade works, instead of scratching the iron surface. The base coating usually also has adhesive properties and keeps the paper attached to the yankee surface until creping2) a release agent based on mineral or vegetable oil or waxes which lubricates and improved the detaching of the paper from the surface3)various modifiers, which may make the coating more soft or hard or improve the protective effect on the yankeeThe coating is sprayed together with water in the space between the <b>creping</b> blade and the press through a spray bar with nozzles. Only the narrow space between this spray bar and the press is the one in which the water coming with the coating shall be evaporated and the polymer has to cure. For this reason for the base coating increasingly pre-cured polymers are used.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the {{abrasive}} {{effect of}} the <b>creping</b> blade {{the surface of the}} yankee becomes irregular and rough. Therefore periodically (with very varying frequency: from every 6 months to some years)cast iron yankees have to be ground or polished. This decreases the thickness of the shell, and since the yankee is a pressure vessel, also the maximum pressure which can be used for paper production. A way to avoid this declassing of pressure is to make a metallisation, i.e. to spray onto the surface a special Chrom-Nickel alloy, similar to a high allyed stainless steel, which is then ground with the foreseen crown of the shell surface, leaving a coated thickness of ca. 0,7-1 mm. The metallised surface is then much more resistant to the abrasion and only a very mild polishing may be necessary ca. every 2 to 4 years.The thermal conductivity of the metallisation is a bit less than that of the original material, so that cast iron cylinders are metallised after some grindings of the shell, in order to gain thorugh thickness decrease some conductivity which is then again lost with the metallisation. Steel yankees are instead always metallised since the beginning. The big dimension generates a problem with the elimination of the condensate forming inside the cylinders, therefore all yankees use a system with blow through steam which than it is re-compressed by help of a thermocompressor (ejector). In the inner surface of the yankee circular grooves are present which accommodate small pipes (s.c. [...] "straw pipes" [...] or [...] "straws") through which the mixture of steam and condensate is sucked ba means of a pressure difference between the yankee and the tank collecting the condensate (separator). The straws are combined in racks and these go to typically 6 collectors which take the condensate-steam mixture towards the center of the cylinder from which then it is taken out into usual piping and brought to the separator. Here the condensate and the blow through steam separate at a lower pressure than that inside the yankee.In order not to spoil the blow through steam, a thermocompressor uses motive steam (at a pressure ca. the double of that in the yankee) in order to increase again the pressure of the blow through steam to the value of the yankee.|$|E
40|$|A tissue machine {{suffering}} from Yankee chatter marks has been experimentally investigated. A series of vibration measurements during normal operation at various Yankee speeds {{on both the}} <b>creping</b> and the cleaning blade holders have been carried out.

40|$|The <b>creping</b> {{process and}} the {{conditions}} on the Yankee cylinder dryer are key factors in a tissue paper mill, and they therefore need to be kept under good control {{in order to maintain}} a high and uniform quality. To this end it would be valuable {{to be able to make}} on-line measurements of Yankee coating thickness as well as the crepe structure of the tissue paper. The adhesion of paper to the cylinder affects the <b>creping</b> process and more information about the parameters that affect the adhesion is therefore of interest. To perform trials on a full scale or in a pilot plant is very costly and laboratory <b>creping</b> equipment is therefore sought after in order to be able to measure the adhesion force. The coating layer for use on the cylinder was analysed. It contained a large amount of carbohydrates and could not be considered transparent. The thickness of the coating layer was measured on a laboratory cylinder with a method based on fluorescence. An optical brightener was added to the coating chemicals and the coating layer was subjected to UV-radiation. The intensity of the light emitted by the optical brightener was measured and gave an indication of the thickness of the coating layer. The equipment has to be further investigated before it is possible to implement the new sensor on-line. New <b>creping</b> equipment and an adhesion method were developed for use on a laboratory scale. The equipment can operate with different <b>creping</b> angles and the force needed to crepe the paper can be measured. The highest <b>creping</b> force was obtained for papers of high grammage, low dryness at adhesion, high drainability, high fines content and high hemicellulose content. A more direct method is to analyse the structure of the produced paper. Measurements were made on a tissue paper with an optical fibre sensor while the paper was travelling at low speed. The collected signal was mathematically analysed and the characteristic wavelength was calculated for different paper samples. These values were close to the wavelengths measured with an off line method by a commercial crepe analyser. Baksidestext The <b>creping</b> process is the heart of tissue paper manufacture. To control the process better, on-line measurements of paper structure and coating thickness are sought after. The <b>creping</b> is highly dependent on the adhesion of the paper to the Yankee dryer. To be able to measure the adhesion, laboratory <b>creping</b> equipment was also required. Different pulp parameters affect the adhesion and some of them have been investigated in this work. The coating on the Yankee cylinder consisted mainly of fiber fragments and could not be considered as transparent, which had to be considered when choosing a method to measure coating thickness. A method based on the light emitted from an optical brightener in the coating when subjected to UV-irradiation was used, but has to be further improved before it can be used on-line. A new laboratory <b>creping</b> method was developed to determine the adhesion between paper and metal, and the force needed to scrape off the paper with a doctor blade was measured.

40|$|In {{production}} of tissue paper, the adhesion of a liquid adhesive <b>creping</b> aid, compound polymer, as <b>creping</b> aids on the Yankee dryer surface was investigated.

40|$|The overall {{objectives}} {{of this project}} were {{to find out if}} fiber-based materials could be creped by creasing process and to design <b>creping</b> patterns that affect the material elongation. Special attention was paid to the difference in the ratio of strain-at-break values between machine and cross direction of paper and paperboard. Scientific principles were used to design the <b>creping</b> pattern. Various techniques were used to analyze the physical and mechanical properties of the creped substrates. In order to analyze the creped samples, microscopic analysis was performed to find the cracks in the substrates. Likewise, tensile strength, bending stiffness, tear strength and grease barrier experiments were performed. Thickness and density were reported in the initial phase of the thesis project. Copy paper performed well, because it was thin and rather dense. However, thick and bulky paperboards were trickier since the force the creasing table produced was limited and probably more force would have been needed for more rigid materials such as three-layer paperboard. The ratio between machine and cross directional elongation (strain ratio) as well as percentual changes in strain at break were reported in the result. It was found that <b>creping</b> made the strain properties of plastics-coated materials more heterogeneous, which suggests that the paperboard should be creped before coating with plastics...|$|E
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{technologies}} {{in the production of}} tissue is the <b>creping</b> process, where the wet paper is adhered to a large drying cylinder and then peeled off the cylinder, when dried, with a doctor blade. The doctoring process changes the structure of the tissue, breaking bonds between the fibres, greatly increasing the thickness while reducing the length of the sheet and creating the soft feel of the tissue. This paper describes a laboratory scale rig that we have built to investigate the <b>creping</b> process. The <b>creping</b> rig is fed by a continuous web from an unwind stand. The web is processed by spraying the desired level of adhesive, type, concentration and volume onto an internally heated cylinder, adhering the web to the heated rotating cylinder using a presser roll, and then doctoring the web from the cylinder and rewinding. Controllable parameters include spray rate, adhesive concentration and type, cylinder temperature, rewind tension and dryer speed. <b>Creping</b> effectiveness is measured on-line from the reduction in web length and from the force required to doctor the sample off the cylinder. Effectiveness is also measured off-line from the change in thickness, strength and stretch of the samples. To obtain stable operation it is necessary to control the rewind tension. The solution finally chosen was to drive the rewind roll with a variable speed motor controlled from the tension from a measuring roll. It was necessary to stringently filter the adhesive to avoid full and partial plugging of the feed lines and spray nozzles. A two stage filter system was necessary, with one filter on the tank outlet and individual filters protecting each of the spray nozzles. Initial results show that crepe ratio, tensile strength, thickness and stretch all fall with increasing web tension and temperature...|$|E

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the development and}} {{construction of a new}} patented doctor blade. A doctor blade is used when <b>creping</b> soft paper from a large rotating Yankee cylinder. At the current state the doctor blade are in use for four to six hours before it needs to be switch due to wearing, stopping the production of soft paper. The new idea is to have a very long and small blade that will slide into a fixed blade and be continuously pulled when <b>creping</b> paper. The company CS Production had a concept of the fixed blade but wanted to further develop it since the blade was too wide.   Measurements where done with the old blade and with the old testing device to measure the pull force required to pull the blade. New concepts where made by the method of brainstorming and evaluated with an elimination matrix. Rivet joints where selected as the joining technique for the new design. The new concept contains one dominant blade that smaller parts were assembled to form the final blade. The material selected for the dominant blade and the section blade was a cold rolled stainless spring steel strip and for the middle disc the material was aluminum bronze string casted. Test on the pull force required where done with the new doctor blade in the new test rig.  FEM simulation where done on {{a small part of the}} blade to see where stresses are occurring in the blade. The FEM result showed that no stresses where on the middle discs, rivets or section blades. This is not reliable results because the small doctor blade is pushing down onto the middle discs and stresses should be occurring on the discs.  Further testing is needed to see if the blade can withstand the forces applied to it...|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{response}} in paper {{has been studied}} by thermography. It was observed that an inhomogeneous deformation pattern arose in the paper samples during tensile testing. In the plastic regime a pattern of warmer streaks could be observed in the samples. On the same samples digital image correlation (DIC) was used to study local strain fields.

Because of its fibrous network structure, paper has an inhomogeneous micro-structure, which is called formation.

40|$|The <b>creping</b> {{process and}} the {{conditions}} on the Yankee cylinder are the key factors in the production process. They need to be kept under good control {{in order to maintain}} a high and uniform quality. A natural coating always develops {{on the surface of the}} Yankee cylinder due to evaporation from dissolved and dispersed substances and to fiber fragments that remain on the surface after <b>creping.</b> Nevertheless, coating chemicals are sprayed onto the Yankee surface in order to modify the adhesion between the paper and the dryer cylinder. To be able to control the process, on-line measurements of coating thickness as well as of the crepe structure of the tissue paper produced would be very valuable. In the work described in this thesis, the coating layer was analyzed chemically and morphologically to provide information about the coating layer before starting any on-line measurements. The chemicals added and the constituents of the pulps are known to the paper producers, but what is left on the cylinder and whether there are different layers of coating still remain to be investigated. The chemical analysis indicated that the adhesive content was higher in an inner layer of the coating than in the outer layer. The relative amount of polyamide-amine resin calculated on the basis of the nominal nitrogen content in the resin was low indicating that the coating consisted of a significant amount of carbohydrates or other substances. The coating layer could not be considered transparent. It was observed that the coating was thick and appeared patch-wise and that it contained fiber fragments. Measurements on a laboratory scale, to further be applied on-line on the tissue machine, have been investigated and evaluated in this study. The thickness of the coating layer on a laboratory dryer has been measured. The method was based on fluorescence with an optical brightener added to the coating chemicals sprayed on the Yankee dryer. With a UV-LED (Ultra Violet - Light Emitting Diode) the coating layer was exposed to UV-light and the intensity of the light emitted by the optical brightener in the layer was measured. The intensity in the trials with different thickness of the coating and no coating was scattered and no trend could be seen between the different trial points. Attempts were made to measure the wavelength of the tissue paper produced with an optical fiber perpendicular to and at an angle to the paper surface. The paper was travelling in a slow speed while the measurements were made. The collected signal to noise ratio was low and it was not possible to detect any representative characteristic wavelength of the tissue...|$|E
