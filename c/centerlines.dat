However, most of the existing methods are not capable of dealing with challenges such as different road shapes, complex scenes, and variable resolutions. This paper presents a novel method for road <b>centerline</b> extraction from imagery in a fully automatic approach that addresses the aforementioned challenges by exploiting road GPS data. The proposed method combines road color feature with road GPS data to detect road <b>centerline</b> seed points. After global alignment of road GPS data, a novel road <b>centerline</b> extraction algorithm is developed to extract each individual road <b>centerline</b> in local regions. Through road connection, road <b>centerline</b> network is generated as the final output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can rapidly and accurately extract road <b>centerline</b> from remotely sensed imagery...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{evaluated}} {{the correlation of}} ultrasound (US) -derived aortic aneurysm diameter measurements with <b>centerline,</b> three-dimensional (3 -D) reconstruction computed tomography (CT) measurements after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). MethodsConcurrent CT and US examinations from 82 patients undergoing post-EVAR surveillance were reviewed. The aortic aneurysm diameter {{was defined as the}} major axis on the <b>centerline</b> images of 3 -D CT reconstruction. This was compared with US-derived minor and major axis measurements, {{as well as with the}} minor axis measurement on the conventional axial CT images. Correlation was evaluated with linear regression analyses. Agreement between different imaging modalities and measurements was assessed with Bland-Altman plots. ResultsThe correlation coefficients from linear regression analyses were 0. 92 between CT <b>centerline</b> major and US minor measurements, 0. 94 between CT <b>centerline</b> major and US major measurements, and 0. 93 between CT minor and <b>centerline</b> major measurements. Bland-Altman plots showed a mean difference of 0. 11 mm between US major and CT <b>centerline</b> measurements compared with 5. 38 mm between US minor and CT <b>centerline</b> measurements, and 4. 25 mm between axial CT minor and <b>centerline</b> measurements. This suggested that, compared with axial CT and US minor axis measurements, US major axis measurements were in better agreement with CT <b>centerline</b> measurements. Variability between major and minor US and CT <b>centerline</b> diameter measurements was high (standard deviation of difference, 4. 27 - 4. 84 mm). However, high variability was also observed between axial CT measurements and <b>centerline</b> CT measurements (standard deviation of difference, 4. 36 mm). ConclusionsThe major axis aneurysm diameter measurement obtained by US imaging for surveillance after EVAR correlates well and is in better agreement with <b>centerline</b> 3 -D CT reconstruction diameters than axial CT...|$|R
