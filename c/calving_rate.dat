2500|$|If {{we begin}} at the stable {{retracted}} position {{at the end of}} a tidewater glacier cycle the glacier will have a moderate <b>calving</b> <b>rate</b> and a high AAR, above 70. [...] The glacier will build a terminus shoal of sediment further reducing the <b>calving</b> <b>rate.</b> [...] This will improve the glacier mass balance and the glacier can begin to advance due to this change or an increase in ice flux to the terminus due to increasing snowfall or reduced snow melt. [...] As the advance proceeds the terminus shoal will be pushed in front of the glacier and continue to build, keeping the <b>calving</b> <b>rate</b> low. [...] In the case of the most glaciers such as the Taku Glacier the glacier will eventually build a terminus shoal that is above water and calving will essentially cease. This will eliminate this loss of ice from the glacier and the glacier can continue to advance. Taku Glacier and Hubbard Glacier have been in this phase of the cycle. Taku Glacier which has been advancing for 120 years no longer calves. Hubbard Glacier still has a calving front. The glacier will then expand until the AAR is between 60 and 70 and equilibrium of the non-calving glacier is achieved. [...] The glacier is not very sensitive to climate during the advance as its AAR is quite high, when the terminus shoal is limiting calving.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accumulation}} area ratio of a glacier, AAR, is {{the percentage of}} a glacier that is a snow-covered accumulation zone {{at the end of}} the summer melt season. [...] This percentage for large Alaskan glaciers is between 60 and 70 for non-calving glaciers, 70-80 for moderately calving glaciers and up to 90 for very high <b>calving</b> <b>rate</b> glaciers. By using {{accumulation area}} ratio (AAR) data for Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers, Pelto (1987) and Viens (1995) produced models showing that climate acts as a first-order control on the advance/retreat cycle of calving glaciers during most of the advance retreat cycle, but there are climate insensitive periods as well. [...] Pelto (1987) examined the terminus behavior of 90 Alaskan glaciers and found that the terminus behavior of all 90 were correctly predicted based on the AAR and <b>calving</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Austin Post {{was one of}} {{the first}} to propose that water depth at the calving margin {{strongly}} affects the rate of iceberg calving. [...] Glaciers that terminate on a morainal shoal are generally stable, but once a glacier retreats into water that deepens as the ice front recedes, <b>calving</b> <b>rate</b> increases rapidly and results in drastic retreat of the terminus. [...] Using data collected from 13 Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers, Brown et al. (1982) derived the following relationship between calving speed and water depth: , where [...] is the mean calving speed (m⋅a−1), [...] is a calving coefficient (27.1±2a−1), [...] is the mean water depth at glacier front (m) and [...] is a constant (0m⋅a−1). [...] Pelto and Warren (1991) found a similar calving relationship with tidewater glaciers observed over longer time periods, with slightly reduced <b>calving</b> <b>rate</b> to the mainly summer rates noted by Brown et al.

40|$|Calving is the {{mechanical}} loss of icebergs from tidewater glaciers, responsible for 70 % {{of the annual}} transfer of mass from the cryosphere to the ocean (van der Veen 1998 a, 2002). To be able to correctly predict future global sea level changes {{it is important to}} understand calving processes and incorporate them into the models. The aim of this thesis is to investigate surface velocities, front positions and <b>calving</b> <b>rates</b> of a fast flowing tidewater glacier in Svalbard using an automatic oblique terrestrial time-lapse camera. The camera took pictures every 30 min from May 1 st to September 16 th 2014 resulting in 6600 images. The project forms part of the ConocoPhillips-Lundin Northern Area Program project CRIOS (<b>Calving</b> <b>Rates</b> and Impact on Sea Level) program whose overall aim is to develop better calving-process models. Mean velocities of Kronebreen increased from 3 m/day in May and reached a peak in mid-July of 5. 3 m/day, with a velocity pattern showing increasing velocities towards the front and the centreline. Velocity results were filtered, sensitivity tested, averaged both spatially and temporally and fit well with previous results. Results suggest that velocity has a forcing from air temperature and rain events due to water inputs in the glacier system. Mean front positions showed a total retreat of 320 m, and <b>calving</b> <b>rates</b> reached a peak in early August of 11 m/day. Different parts of the front showed different styles of retreat, and therefore calving styles. Inter-meltwater-plume areas were dominated by infrequent large calving events, and plume areas were dominated by continuous <b>calving.</b> Mean <b>calving</b> <b>rates</b> may be atmospherically controlled, but internal dynamics, melt-water plumes and fjord temperatures may also play a role. The high resolution both spatially and temporally gained using this method makes it possible to investigate the nature of calving and the evolution of surface velocity patterns in more detail than satellite derived results. These data are required for improving the understanding of calving dynamics to develop sea level rise models...|$|R

2500|$|Calving is an {{important}} form of ablation for glaciers that terminate in freshwater, also. [...] Funk and Röthlisberger determined a relationship between calving speed and water depth based on analysis of six glaciers that calve into lakes. [...] They found that the same basic calving relationship developed for tidewater calving glaciers was true for freshwater calving glaciers, only the calving coefficients lead to <b>calving</b> <b>rates</b> 10% of that for tidewater glaciers.|$|R
2500|$|At {{some point}} the glacier reaches a pinning point where calving is reduced due to a fjord {{narrowing}} or shoaling and the glacier’s AAR is near 100. [...] This is occurring with LeConte Glacier and Yathse Glacier. [...] Le Conte Glacier currently has an AAR of 90, is at a retracted position and seems likely to be set to advance after building a terminus shoal. The drop in <b>calving</b> <b>rate</b> allows the glacier to reestablish equilibrium.|$|E
2500|$|The best current {{example is}} {{illustrated}} by the United States Geological Survey study of Columbia Glacier. [...] They noted that the average <b>calving</b> <b>rate</b> from Columbia Glacier increased from 3km3⋅a−1 {{in the second half of}} 1983 to 4km3⋅a−1 during the first nine months of 1984. This rate was four times greater than that measured at the end of 1977 and increased again in 1985. The glacier flow, i.e., the movement of the ice toward the sea, also increased, it was inadequate to keep pace with the break-up and expulsion of icebergs. [...] The increase in speed instead seemed to just feed the ever faster conveyor to the terminus for iceberg production. This prompted the USGS to predict that the glacier would retreat 32km before stabilizing. [...] By 2006, it has retreated 16km. The water remains deep and the <b>calving</b> <b>rate</b> and glacier velocity very high, indicating retreat will continue. At this point, just like having a balloon payment in an adjustable rate mortgage, the glacier has to pay a whole new portion of its balance via icebergs. [...] The glacier accelerates as flow is enhanced by the calving process; this increases the export of icebergs from the glacier. [...] Large calving retreats are initiated by warming conditions causing ice thinning. [...] The resulting retreat to a new equilibrium conditions can be far more extensive than will be regained during the next advance stage. A good example of this is Muir Glacier.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>calving</b> <b>rate</b> will {{increase}} as the glacier retreats from the shoal into the deeper fjord just cleared by the glacier during advance. [...] The water depth initially increases as the glacier retreats from the shoal, causing every more rapid glacier flow, calving and retreat. [...] A glacier is comparatively insensitive to climate during this calving retreat. [...] However, {{in the case}} of San Rafael Glacier, Chile, a switch from retreat [...] (1945–1990) to advance (1990–1997) was noted. Current examples of this retreat are Columbia Glacier and Guyot Glacier. [...] The most famous recent example of this is the large retreat of Glacier Bay and Icy Bay glaciers in Alaska that occurred rapidly via this process.|$|E

Results are analyzed in combination with observations of bathymetry, bed elevation, ice front retreat, and glacier speed.

40|$|The Canadian Arctic {{contains}} the largest area of land ice (~ 150, 000 km 2) on Earth outside the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica {{and is a}} potentially significant contributor to global sea level change. The current ice cover includes large ice caps that are remnants of the Wisconsinan Laurentide and Innuitian ice sheets, and many smaller ice caps and valley glaciers that formed during the late Holocene.

40|$|Mass balance {{variations}} of Glaciar San Rafael, the most equatorial tidewater glacier in the North Patagonian Icefield, are reconstructed {{over the period}} 1950 – 2005 using NCEP-NCAR reanalysis climate data together with sparse, local historical observations of air temperature, precipitation, accumulation, ablation, thinning, calving, and glacier retreat.

Over that period, except {{for a short period}} of cooling from 1998 – 2003, the climate has become progressively warmer and drier, which has resulted primarily in pervasive thinning of the glacier surface and a decrease in <b>calving</b> <b>rates,</b> with only minor acceleration in retreat of the terminus.

40|$|Recent estimations of {{mass loss}} caused by iceberg calving {{are limited to}} huge icebergs (> 18. 5 km edge length) or are {{spatially}} limited. Since the 1970 s, the course of huge icebergs is permanently tracked using satellite images by the National Ice Center (NIC). A large brake off event is undetected very likely and huge icebergs are easily to track on {{their way through the}} ocean. In many cases, calving of smaller icebergs takes place unobserved, which hampers the estimation of <b>calving</b> <b>rates</b> and mass loss caused by iceberg calving.

Using the results of the classification, icebergs within SAR images could be assigned to their potential calving front. An iceberg drift model is then used to certify the origin.

40|$|Thwaites Glacier (TG), West Antarctica, {{has been}} losing mass and {{retreating}} {{rapidly in the}} past few decades. Here, we present a study of its calving dynamics combining a two-dimensional flow-band full-Stokes (FS) model of its viscous flow with linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) theory to model crevasse propagation and ice fracturing. We compare the results with those obtained with the higher-order (HO) and the shallow-shelf approximation (SSA) models coupled with LEFM. We find that FS/LEFM produces surface and bottom crevasses that are consistent with the distribution of depth and width of surface and bottom crevasses observed by NASA's Operation IceBridge radar depth sounder and laser altimeter, whereas HO/LEFM and SSA/LEFM do not generate crevasses that are consistent with observations. We attribute the difference to the nonhydrostatic condition of ice near the grounding line, which facilitates crevasse formation and is accounted for by the FS model but not by the HO or SSA models. We find that calving is enhanced when pre-existing surface crevasses are present, when the ice shelf is shortened or when the ice shelf front is undercut. The role of undercutting depends on the timescale of calving events. It is more prominent for glaciers with rapid <b>calving</b> <b>rates</b> than for glaciers with slow <b>calving</b> <b>rates.</b> Glaciers extending into a shorter ice shelf are more vulnerable to calving than glaciers developing a long ice shelf, especially as the ice front retreats close to the grounding line region, which leads to a positive feedback to calving events. We conclude that the FS/LEFM combination yields substantial improvements in capturing the stress field near the grounding line of a glacier for constraining crevasse formation and iceberg calving...|$|R
