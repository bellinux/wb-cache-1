40|$|<b>Sun</b> <b>sensors</b> are an {{integral}} part of the attitude and orbit control system onboard almost any spacecraft. While the majority of standard analogue <b>sun</b> <b>sensors</b> is based on photo-detectors which produce photo-currents proportional to the cosine of the incidence angle (<b>cosine</b> <b>detectors),</b> we propose an alternative scheme where the vectorial photoelectric effect is exploited to achieve a higher sensitivity of the sensed photo-current to the incidence angle. The vectorial photo-effect is investigated in detail for metal cathode detectors in a space environment. Besides long operational lifetimes without significant degradation, metal cathode detectors are insensitive to earth albedo, which may significantly reduce the errors affecting attitude measurements in low earth orbits. Sensitivity curves are calculated and trade-offs performed with the aim of optimizing the sensitivity whilst also providing currents sufficient for detection. Simple applications and detector configurations are also discussed and compared to existing designs. Comment: draft, 9 pages, 6 figures (Color...|$|R

40|$|With {{the current}} {{increased}} widespread {{interest in the}} development and applications of micro/nanosatellites, it was found that we needed to design a small high accuracy satellite attitude determination system, because the star trackers widely used in large satellites are large and heavy, and therefore not suitable for installation on micro/nanosatellites. A <b>Sun</b> <b>sensor</b> + magnetometer is proven to be a better alternative, but the conventional <b>sun</b> <b>sensor</b> has low accuracy, and cannot meet the requirements of the attitude determination systems of micro/nanosatellites, so the development of a small high accuracy <b>sun</b> <b>sensor</b> with high reliability is very significant. This paper presents a multi-aperture based <b>sun</b> <b>sensor,</b> which is composed of a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) mask with 36 apertures and an active pixels sensor (APS) CMOS placed below the mask at a certain distance. A novel fast multi-point MEANSHIFT (FMMS) algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy and reliability, the two key performance features, of an APS <b>sun</b> <b>sensor.</b> When the sunlight illuminates the <b>sensor,</b> a <b>sun</b> spot array image is formed on the APS <b>detector.</b> Then the <b>sun</b> angles can be derived by analyzing the aperture image location on the detector via the FMMS algorithm. With this system, the centroid accuracy of the sun image can reach 0. 01 pixels, without increasing the weight and power consumption, even when some missing apertures and bad pixels appear on the detector due to aging of the devices and operation in a harsh space environment, while the pointing accuracy of the single-aperture <b>sun</b> <b>sensor</b> using the conventional correlation algorithm is only 0. 05 pixels...|$|R

The model {{can be used to}} study the effect of both diffusive and specular reflections and to improve Sun angle determination based on perturbed <b>Sun</b> <b>sensor</b> measurements, satellite position, and an approximate knowledge of attitude. The model predicts that diffuse reflected light can cause errors of up to 10 degrees in Coarse <b>Sun</b> <b>Sensor</b> (CSS) measurements and 5 to 10 arc sec in Fine <b>Sun</b> <b>Sensor</b> (FSS) measurements, depending on spacecraft orbit and attitude.

Digital <b>Sun</b> <b>Sensors</b> (DSS) respond in a different manner to the Earth albedo interference. Most of the time DSS measurements are not affected, but for brief periods of time the Earth albedo can cause errors which are a multiple of the sensor least significant bit and may exceed one degree. This paper compares model predictions with Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) CSS measurements in order to validate and refine the model. Methods of reducing and mitigating the impact of Earth albedo are discussed. ne CSS sensor errors are roughly proportional to the Earth albedo coefficient.
