A prototype school bus {{was designed and}} constructed. This bus incorporated many new technologies to increase {{the safety of the}} bus passengers as well as pedestrians boarding and leaving the bus. These technologies emphasized increased visibility between the bus driver and pedestrians or vehicles, and included the use of high intensity discharge lighting, pedestrian and vehicle detection systems, and remote-mounted cameras. Passenger safety was also stressed, with the application of seat belts and improved emergency exits and lighting. A natural gas-fueled engine was developed for powering the bus. The development process focused primarily on improvements to the lean operation of the engine and control system advancements. The control system development included investigations into alternative control algorithms for steady-state and transient operation, various fuel metering devices, as well as new methods for wastegate control, knock and misfire detection, and <b>catalyst</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Both the vehicle and engine systems represent state-of-the-art technologies.

Moreover, mixtures of catalysts with different molecular masses can be screened simultaneously, which is not possible with methods relying on product analysis.
