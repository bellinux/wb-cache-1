5|$|In a 2009 {{revision}} of the Oryzomys of western Mexico, M.D. Carleton and J. Arroyo-Cabrales noted substantial differences in coloration and measurements between highland populations (albiventer) and lowland populations (mexicanus) in Jalisco. On {{the basis of these}} differences, they recognized O.albiventer as a species separate from the lowland populations, which they classified under O.couesi. They confirmed that Eliot's molestus was based on a large example of O.abiventer, but left the status of the three forms Goldman had associated with albiventer—crinitus, aztecus, and regillus—open, noting that there was no <b>convincing</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> these represented the same species as O.albiventer. The identity and exact provenance of fulgens (supposed to be from the Valley of Mexico), and consequently its relationship to O. albiventer, remain unknown.|$|E

25|$|Application of a {{tourniquet}} to the bitten limb {{is generally}} not recommended. There is no <b>convincing</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> it is an effective first-aid tool as ordinarily applied. Tourniquets {{have been found to}} be completely ineffective in the treatment of Crotalus durissus bites, but some positive results have been seen with properly applied tourniquets for cobra venom in the Philippines. Uninformed tourniquet use is dangerous, since reducing or cutting off circulation can lead to gangrene, which can be fatal. The use of a compression bandage is generally as effective, and much safer.|$|E

Benzodiazepines tend to lose their sleep-promoting properties within 3–14 days of continuous use, and, in the treatment of anxiety, the committee found that there was little <b>convincing</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> benzodiazepines retains efficacy in the treatment of anxiety after 4 months of continuous use due to the development of tolerance.|$|E
25|$|The {{conclusions}} of many trials and numerous systematic reviews of acupuncture are largely inconsistent with each other. A 2011 systematic review of systematic reviews {{found that for}} reducing pain, real acupuncture was no better than sham acupuncture, and concluded that numerous reviews have shown little <b>convincing</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> acupuncture is an effective treatment for reducing pain. The same review found that neck pain {{was one of only}} four types of pain for which a positive effect was suggested, but cautioned that the primary studies used carried a considerable risk of bias. A 2009 overview of Cochrane reviews found acupuncture is not effective {{for a wide range of}} conditions.|$|E
25|$|On December 13, Moore filed {{his appeal}} brief {{with the special}} Alabama Supreme Court that had been {{appointed}} to hear his appeal. He argued, among other things, that the COJ did not have jurisdiction or authority to review administrative orders of the Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, and that the JIC had failed to prove by <b>convincing</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> he violated the Canons of Judicial Conduct. Moore also argued that his suspension from the bench {{for the remainder of}} his term was de facto removal from office, which required unanimous agreement {{of the members of the}} COJ, and therefore was improper under Alabama law.|$|E

40|$|The {{recently}} developed 'ligated' technique {{has proved to}} be very successful in promoting living anionic polymerization of (meth) acrylic ester monomers. The efficient ligands discovered to date include mu, sigma and mu-sigma dual types. The roles of these ligands in the control of livingness and stereoregularity of anionic polymerization of (meth) acrylates are discussed in detail. There is <b>convincing</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>that</b> both ligation thermodynamics (electron density redistribution and steric hindrance in the formed active complex) and kinetics (how fast and in which way ligation occurs) are very critical in promoting the livingness. Moreover, steric hindrance appears to be a determining factor maintaining the process 'living' under more demanding conditions. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The Committee of Review of Medicines, who carried out an extensive review of benzodiazepines including chlordiazepoxide, found - and were in agreement with the Institute of Medicine (USA) and the conclusions of a study carried out by the White House Office of Drug Policy and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (USA) - that there was little evidence that long-term use of benzodiazepines were beneficial in the treatment of insomnia due {{to the development of}} tolerance. Benzodiazepines tended to lose their sleep-promoting properties within 314 days of continuous use, and in the treatment of anxiety the committee found that there was little <b>convincing</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> benzodiazepines retained efficacy in the treatment of anxiety after 4 months' continuous use due to the development of tolerance.|$|E

500|$|Toal {{then turned}} to the last issue, the trial court's refusal to {{terminate}} Brown's parental rights. The Capobiancos could not show that Brown had agreed to consent to the adoption. The court noted that the ICWA set out clear procedural guidelines and the Capobiancos did not comply with those requirements. [...] The Capobiancos also failed to show by clear and <b>convincing</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Brown's parental rights should be terminated. Under the ICWA, prior to terminating an Indian parent's rights to the Indian child, the party seeking to terminate parental rights [...] "shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful." [...] The court noted that the Capobiancos made no efforts to comply with this requirement of federal law, but had actively sought to prevent the father from obtaining custody since the child was four months old.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Due to its irrational character, {{the atomic}} {{arrangement}} along the twin plane of h 011 i type II twin in NiTi {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) has been an issue of disagreement over the past years. Understanding the atomic arrangement along the type II twin plane is important, both scientifically and practically, as it is strongly related to the lattice shear during martensitic transformation, the deformation mechanism of SMA, and the shape recovery associated with reverse phase transformation. The present research carefully studies the h 011 i type II twin plane through HRTEM observation, crystallographic analysis, atomic image simulation, and reexamination of the major reported HRTEM observations, providing <b>convincing</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>that</b> the irrational h 011 i type II twin is atomically rational.
