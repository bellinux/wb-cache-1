50|$|New MCR's {{are found}} by {{building}} a chemical library from combinatorial chemistry or by <b>combining</b> existing <b>MCR's.</b> For example, a 7-component <b>MCR</b> results from <b>combining</b> the Ugi reaction with the Asinger reaction. MCR's are an important tool in new drug discovery. MCR's can often be extended into combinatorial, solid phase or flow syntheses for developing new lead structures of active agents.|$|R

Previous papers contain one transmitter and number of receivers. Now we extend this with two antennas and two receivers. Those have same frequency or different. The results are shown in data as bits. To solve this problem for used the techniques of Maximal <b>Combine</b> Ratio (<b>MCR)</b> and Maximal likelihood receiver.

30|$|Group III are {{combined}} exposures {{where there is}} a low concern for individual chemicals but there is a concern for the combined effects (all HQs are less than one but the HI is greater than 1). This is the critical group for further assessments since the concern for these exposures cannot be identified using a chemical-by-chemical approach. This group is further divided into Group IIIA where one chemical provides the majority of toxicity of the <b>combined</b> exposures (<b>MCR</b> is less than two) and Group IIIB where no one chemical dominates the toxicity of the exposures (MCR is greater than two).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a Multiple <b>Combined</b> Ranker (<b>MCR)</b> approach for answering definitional questions. Generally, our MCR approach first extracts question target-related knowledge {{as much as}} possible, then using this knowledge to pick up appropriate question answers. The knowledge includes both online definitions and related terms (RT). In our system, extraction of related terms is different from traditional methods which are largely based on calculating the co-occurred frequency of target words. We adopted the significance of sentences and documents, from which RT were extracted. The MCR approach shows state-in-art performance in handling with increasingly complex definitional questions...|$|R

The College of St Hild and St Bede has a [...] "Students Representative Council", which includes both undergraduates and postgraduates at the college, {{with a special}} postgraduate committee. St.Aidan's College <b>combines</b> the <b>MCR</b> and SCR into one SCR whereby the postgraduates and senior members belong to one Common Room as a whole, while St Cuthbert's Society combines the JCR and MCR into one JCR. Following a referendum in 2011, students of St. John's College are represented by the [...] "John's Common Room" [...] (JCR) a composite body representing Undergraduates, the MCR (Postgraduates) and the Cranmer Common Room (representing the students of Cranmer Hall) (pre-2011 the body was the Joint Junior Common Rom JJCR). Ustinov College, which does not take undergraduates, has a Graduate Common Room (GCR) for its students.|$|R
40|$|Aim of this {{dissertation}} is {{to address}} how innovative MCRs are in medicinal chemistry {{and how they}} can be used in different cases. The MCR derived products can be considered as a synthetic hub to a vast diversity of novel cyclic or acyclic scaffolds by employing different secondary transformations. This “union of MCRs“ can serve as a strategy for the rational design of novel <b>MCRs</b> <b>combining</b> two (or more) different types of MCRs in a one-pot process...|$|R
30|$|<b>Combined</b> {{exposures}} with <b>MCR</b> values {{less than}} two are placed into Group IIIA. These exposures have one chemical (the primary chemical) that contributes {{the majority of the}} toxicity of the mixture. Efforts to refine the estimates of toxicity and/or exposure (WHO Tier 2 or 3 assessment), or to reduce exposures should focus on this primary chemical. Once this is done, the HI value is revised (Step 16). If the revised value is less than 1, the exposure is moved to Group II; if not, the combined exposure is moved to Step 17.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{efficiency}} {{of a chemical}} synthesis can be nowadays measured, not only by parameters like selectivity and overall yield, but also by its raw material, time, human resources and energy requirements, {{as well as the}} toxicity and hazard of the chemicals and the protocols involved. The development of multicomponent reactions (MCRs) in the presence of task-specific ionic liquids (ILs), used not only as environmentally benign reaction media, but also as catalysts, is a new approach that meet with the requirements of sustainable chemistry. The aim of this tutorial review is to highlight the synergistic effect of the <b>combined</b> use of <b>MCRs</b> and ILs for the development of new eco-compatible methodologies for heterocyclic chemistry...|$|R
30|$|A second {{component}} of the decision tree {{is the use of}} the MCR to identify the optimum approaches for assessing and managing risks from <b>combined</b> exposures. The <b>MCR</b> is the ratio of the total toxicity a receptor receives from its combined exposures to multiple chemicals divided by the largest toxicity it receives from any single chemical [7, 8]. MCR values range from one to n (where n is the number of chemicals that reach a receptor). The chemical with the largest contribution {{is referred to as the}} primary chemical. Values close to one indicate that the primary chemical dominates the toxicity of the exposures. Values less than two indicate that the primary chemical provides more than 50 percent of the toxicity for the receptor. Values of n indicate that the receptor is exposed to equitoxic doses of all chemicals.|$|R
40|$|The {{current work}} investigates the {{capability}} of a tailored multivariate curve resolution–alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) algorithm to analyse glucose, phosphate, ammonium and acetate dynamics simultaneously in an E. coli BL 21 fed-batch fermentation. The high-cell-density (HCDC) process is monitored by ex situ online attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and several in situ online process sensors. This approach efficiently utilises automatically generated process data to reduce the time and cost consuming reference measurement effort for multivariate calibration. To determine metabolite concentrations with accuracies between ± 0. 19 and ± 0. 96 ·gL−l, the presented utilisation needs primarily—besides online sensor measurements—single FTIR measurements {{for each of the}} components of interest. The ambiguities in alternating least squares solutions for concentration estimation are reduced by the insertion of analytical process knowledge primarily in the form of elementary carbon mass balances. Thus, in this way, the established idea of mass balance constraints in <b>MCR</b> <b>combines</b> with the consistency check of measured data by carbon balances, as commonly applied in bioprocess engineering. The constraints are calculated based on online process data and theoretical assumptions. This increased calculation effort is able to replace, to a large extent, the need for manually conducted quantitative chemical analysis, leads to good estimations of concentration profiles and a better process understanding...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Wong and Sandler published two important articles in 1992 that established new mixture <b>combining</b> rules (<b>MCR)</b> for use with cubic equations of state (EOS) in the prediction and correlation of vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) over wide ranges of pressure and temperature for binary and ternary systems including those containing polar components. These new MCR appeared to contain more basic physics than that did the familiar van der Waals (vdW), one fluid model rules that generally could not predict VLE without at least one tuning factor kl 2, the binary interaction constant. The MCR proposed by Wong and Sandler consist of a gas-side equation and a liquid-side equation. The former is based upon the familiar quadratic MCR of the second virial coefficient, Bm(yi,T). They re-introduced kl 2 to get the cross second virial coefficient B 12. The first major contribution of this thesis is to use experimental values of B 12 (l) and thus eliminate kl 2. Thus we predict VLE results a priori rather than correlate kl 2 to match those results. When experimental values of B 12 are not available, they can be estimated independently by the well-known method of Tsonopoulos. We have also shown that the WS/MCR can be better expressed in terms of 312 = 2 B 12 -B 11 -B 22. The second major contribution of this thesis concerns the influence of temperature upon A- = G- in the liquid-side MCR. We have shown that for cubic EOS with (1) vdW repulsion and (2) the attraction constant independent of temperature, S@- is equal to zero. Thus, A! is independent of temperature, a regular solution assumption. However, Wong and Sandler chose the atherrnal solution assumption of H'=O or (A!/RT) is independent of temperature. Thus, calculations by Wong and Sandler over wide ranges of temperature are inconsistent with their liquid-side MCR. We have corrected this problem in this thesis to improve somewhat the agreement with VLE data. In summary, this thesis has made important changes in how the new W-S/A 4 CR are used but has not changed the MCR themselves...|$|R
