In this paper, we incorporate foreign subsidization considerations into a model based on Staiger and Wolak’s (1992) cyclical-dumping framework and illustrate testable implications of both <b>cyclical</b> <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> and structural excess capacity stemming from foreign subsidization. We then use detailed product- and foreign country-level data on steel exports to the U. S. market from 1979 through 2002 to estimate these excess capacity effects. The results provide strong evidence of both cyclical and structural excess capacity effects for exports to the U. S. market. However, the effects are confined to such a narrow range of country-product combinations that {{it is unlikely that}} such effects were a significant factor in the fortunes of U. S. steel firms over the past decades. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the nature and}} consequences of China's rise {{to the center of}} world economic affairs through manufacturing-led development. Our historical analysis shows that China is still well short of the point in its developmental process where its growth might be reasonably expected to slow, or the energy, resource and carbon intensity of growth to recede. The study argues that the current trajectory of industrialization will have to be altered when China becomes more actively engaged in dealing with structural issues at home and abroad against the background of the unwinding of global imbalances. One profitable strategy that China might employ would be to approximate the incredibly fruitful mass-market integration efforts of the USA that eventually elevated it to its position of global primacy. The <b>cyclical</b> re-emergence of <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> in Chinese heavy industry, serious questions about the medium term ability of other major regions to accommodate further large gains in Chinese market share, and the stark conflict between the contemporary style of industrial development and the health of the biosphere indicate strongly that {{now is the time to}} catalyze the required adjustment and reform processes that will underpin sustainable long-run prosperity.

40|$|<b>Excess</b> <b>capacity</b> is a {{major issue}} in world fisheries. In {{addition}} to reducing the ability of managers to control the global harvest and increasing the potential for effort spill-over between fisheries, <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> introduces a prospective level of economic waste in the fishery. When there is <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> in a fishery, more inputs are being used than is necessary to produce the current output and economic theory suggests that the net benefit to society from the resource exploitation is not maximised. Fishery managers worldwide are concerned with reducing the levels of <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> in their fisheries. In fisheries where ‘race to fish’ behaviour is prominent, competitive harvesting can also encourage inefficient investments in capital which create the potential for problematic <b>excess</b> <b>capacity.</b> Such behaviour is termed the ‘race to invest’ in this thesis. The objective of the thesis is to investigate how race to fish and race to invest behaviours affect the level of <b>excess</b> <b>capacity.</b> The thesis consists of three essays, in which <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> is examined in the open access fishery, where the race to fish and race to invest are pervasive, and also during a period of race behaviour in a catch-controlled fishery. The first essay investigates the relationship between the malleability of capital and the level of <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> using a dynamic model of the open access fishery. The malleability of capital in this essay is represented by a difference between the purchase and resale prices of capital. The second essay investigates the connection between environmental variation and <b>excess</b> <b>capacity,</b> also in the open access fishery. This essay characterises the emergence of <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> under transient fluctuations in recruitment, and also uses parameterised simulations to investigate <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> when there is a regular cyclical fluctuation in recruitment and for ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ regime shifts, where the recruitment of the fishery permanently increases or decreases. In these essays, the race to fish and the race to invest are modelled separately, so the conventional race to fish determines the level of fishing effort (i. e. capacity utilisation) and the level of capital investment is driven by a race to invest, in which fishers’ expectations are formed myopically (according to the theory of projection bias). The third essay undertakes an empirical analysis of <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> and efficiency in the Tasmanian rock lobster fishery using the Data Envelopment Analysis methodology. This essay investigates whether the adjustment of the fishery, after the introduction of the Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) system in 1998, has occurred over a prolonged period of time. This would suggest that the ITQ system may have a larger impact on <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> in that fishery than is indicated by comparable studies in other fisheries. In addition, this essay looks for evidence of the re-emergence of <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> in the fishery during a period of non-binding Total Allowable Catch (TAC) between the 2008 and the 2010 quota years. The results in this thesis highlight a potential trade-off between <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> and the biological outcome for the fishery, which suggests caution in using the level of <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> as an indication of the fishery’s health. The results also show that the reduction or elimination of <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> can be achieved through increasing the malleability of capital or by the cessation of competitive investment during transient positive fluctuations in recruitment. Finally, the thesis finds little evidence for a temporal change in either <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> or efficiency following the introduction of an ITQ system in the Tasmanian rock lobster fishery, and confirms that a period of non-binding TAC in that fishery was not associated with an increase in <b>excess</b> <b>capacity...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to shed light}} on the proposal that firms in concentrated industries may keep <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> to forestall entry or expansion by rivals. <b>Excess</b> <b>capacity</b> can deter entry by forming expectations on the part of potential entrants that dominant firms are capable of responding aggressively to threats. But {{in order to make a}} convincing case for <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> as a strategic entry deterrent, all potential sources of <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> must be considered simultaneously. These may include industry-specific structural factors, such as the divisibility of demand relative to supply, economies of scale or wide swings in demand. Ocean liner shipping exhibits structural factors that have led <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> for much of its history. It is a concentrated industry that until the late 1990 s was dominated by price fixing industry groups known as liner shipping conferences. In spite of limited antitrust immunity granted by most governments to liner shipping conferences, <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> is and has been a persistent problem that could be a major cause of operational inefficiencies. As such, ocean liner shipping presents an ideal forum in which to distinguish between <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> that is an artefact of structural conditions of supply and demand and <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> that may be deployed as a strategic defense against opportunistic rivals. The results of a random effects model with instrumental variables show some limited support for the entry deterrence element of <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> in liner shipping.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to examine the role of <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> as an entry deterrence instrument. The firms operating in industries have an incentive to deter entry of new competitors because the entry would lead to increased supply and bring down the profits of the established firms. There are several different instruments that firms can use to prevent the entry and one of these instruments can be <b>excess</b> <b>capacity.</b> The <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> can prevent entry when the market demand is not growing sufficiently to accommodate the new entrant and the incumbent is able to cut prices to maintain output levels. This situation leads to a risk of lower profits or losses for the entrant due to the lower prices and creates unwillingness to enter. The study examined the role of <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> as an entry deterrence instrument with three theoretical models and empirical evidence found from the literature. In addition to these, the study presented an alternative approach to <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> as an instrument to promote entry. The theoretical models presented included a two-stage duopoly model, a three-stage duopoly model and an oligopoly model. The duopoly models included an entrant and incumbent and oligopoly model entrant and industries which were either tight or loose oligopolies. The model suggesting <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> as an entry promoter was a model with monopsonist buying an input from large number of suppliers. The empirical evidence was based on the study that analysed the data sample of 38 chemical products with 20 years coverage. Main findings of the study were that <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> can be used to prevent entry in certain circumstances. Among the duopoly models, three-stage model was found to imply a larger set of technologies in which entry deterrence is possible. In oligopoly model entry deterrence was found to be possible if entrants cannot separate loose oligopolies and tight oligopolies with <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> from each other. <b>Excess</b> <b>capacity</b> was also found to be effective entry promoter in certain circumstances. No significant empirical evidence concerning <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> as entry deterrence was found from the literature. Endast sammandrag.

Furthermore, we show that the tougher the enforcement, the lower the firms' production capacity. With tradable quotas, the quota price strengthens the effect of tougher (or weaker) enforcement. At the aggregate level production quotas do not fully internalize the production externality when enforcement is imperfect. In such situations, additional management instruments are required to correct the firms' incentives to build up <b>excess</b> <b>capacity,</b> which exacerbate the non-compliance problem...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In a {{depressed}} economy, with short-term nominal interest rates at their zero lower bound, ample <b>cyclical</b> unemployment, and <b>excess</b> <b>capacity,</b> increased government purchases would be neither {{offset by the}} monetary authority raising interest rates nor neutralized by supply-side bottlenecks. Then even {{a small amount of}} hysteresis—even a small shadow cast on future potential output by the cyclical downturn—means, by simple arithmetic, that expansionary fiscal policy is likely to be self-financing. Even if it is not, it is highly likely to pass the sensible benefit-cost test of raising the present value of future potential output. Thus, at the zero bound, where the central bank cannot or will not but in any event does not perform its full role in stabilization policy, fiscal policy has the stabilization policy mission that others have convincingly argued it lacks in normal times. Whereas many economists have assumed that the path of potential output is invariant to even a deep and prolonged downturn, the available evidence raises a strong fear that hysteresis is indeed a factor. Although nothing in our analysis calls into question the importance of sustainable fiscal policies, it strongly suggests the need for caution regarding the pace of fiscal consolidation. This paper examines fiscal policy {{in the context of an}} economy suffering, like the United States today, from protracted high unemployment and output short of potential. We argue that although the conventional wisdom articulated by John Taylor (2000) rejecting discretionary fiscal policy is appropriate in normal times, such policy has a major role to play in a severe downturn in the aftermath of a financial crisis that carries interest rates down to the zero nominal lower bound. Our analysis reaches five conclusions about fiscal policy as a stabilization tool in {{a depressed}} as opposed to a normal economy: —The absence of supply constraints in the short term, together with a binding zero lower bound on interest rates, means that the Keynesia...|$|R

However, with imperfect quota enforcement, firms may have incentives {{to build up}} <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> relative to their quotas. Firms with more <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> may, in turn, have stronger incentives to violate quotas. We consider regulation with non-transferable and transferable quotas and investigate the relationship between enforcement, compliance and capital levels in the short and long run. In the short run, <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> leads to increased illegal production but a well-functioning quota market may alleviate the problem. In the long run, the possibility to exceed quotas gives firms incentives to build up <b>excess</b> <b>capacity</b> relative to their quotas. Furthermore, we show that the tougher the enforcement, the lower the firms’ production capacity. With non-transferable quotas, only violating firms are affected by tougher enforcement. When quotas are transferable, however, tougher enforcement causes violating firms to demand more quotas, which yields {{an increase in the}} quota price that effects all firms.
