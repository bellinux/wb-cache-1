5|$|It was mid-September before {{news of the}} {{declaration}} of independence spread to the outer islands, and many Indonesians far from the capital Jakarta did not believe it. As the news spread, most Indonesians came to regard themselves as pro-Republican, and a mood of revolution swept across the country. External power had shifted; it would be weeks before Allied Forces entered Indonesia, and the Dutch were too weakened by World War II. The Japanese, on the other hand, were required by the terms of the surrender to both lay down their arms and maintain order; a <b>contradiction</b> <b>that</b> some resolved by handing weapons to Japanese-trained Indonesians.|$|E

25|$|On December 7, Cantor sent Dedekind a proof by <b>contradiction</b> <b>that</b> {{the set of}} real {{numbers is}} uncountable.

Regional stories of Gauri suggest an alternate origin for Gauri's name and complexion.

Frank Furness' Clearing House, now demolished {{like many of his}} best works in Philadelphia, contained an array of violent pressures within a rigid frame. The half-segmental arch, blocked by the submerged tower which, in turn, bisects the facade into a near duality, and the violent adjacencies of rectangles, squares, lunettes, and diagonals of contrasting sizes, compose a building seemingly held up by the buildings next door: it is an almost insane short story of a castle on a city street.|$|E

25|$|In its {{original}} formulation as presented by Paul Ehrenfest 1909 {{in relation to}} the concept of Born rigidity within special relativity, it discusses an ideally rigid cylinder that is made to rotate about its axis of symmetry. The radius R as seen in the laboratory frame is always perpendicular to its motion and should therefore be equal to its value R0 when stationary. However, the circumference (2πR) should appear Lorentz-contracted to a smaller value than at rest, by the usual factor γ. This leads to the <b>contradiction</b> <b>that</b> R=R0 and R0.|$|E

Kosi resonates with the folklore of Mithila. The most important depictions of Kosi folklore are Kosi as a virgin absolutely care free and full of energy and as a frustrated wife of old hermit Richeek wandering in the Himalayas. Kosi is also invoked as the mother - 'Kosi Ma'. These images capture the <b>contradiction</b> <b>that</b> is inherent in the Kosi River as a source of life and death, prosperity and destruction; a mother and an enchanting virgin.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} funeral, one of Pankhurst's bodyguards from her WSPU days, Katherine Marshall, began raising {{funds for a}} {{memorial}} statue. In spring 1930 her efforts bore fruit, and on 6 March her statue in Victoria Tower Gardens was unveiled. A crowd of radicals, former suffragettes, and national dignitaries gathered as former Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin presented the memorial to the public. In his address, Baldwin declared: [...] "I say with no fear of <b>contradiction,</b> <b>that</b> whatever view posterity may take, Mrs. Pankhurst has won for herself a niche in the Temple of Fame which will last for all time." [...] Sylvia was the only Pankhurst daughter in attendance; Christabel, touring North America, sent a telegram which was read aloud. While planning {{the agenda for the}} day, Marshall had intentionally excluded Sylvia, who in her opinion had hastened Pankhurst's death.|$|E
500|$|In 1365 {{the manor}} and 13th-century moated house {{passed into the}} Restwold family, and it passed through {{marriage}} to the Drew family of Seagry, Wiltshire, then the Sambourne family. Margaret Sambourne, {{the heir to the}} manor, died in 1494 and an inquisition the following year suggested that she held the manor (then valued at £20) as a trustee on behalf of Hugh Kenepy. Around this time a brick house was built to replace the earlier dwelling. After the death of Sambourne's son, Drew, an inquisition reported in <b>contradiction</b> <b>that</b> the manor was held by the Abbot of Reading; in their work on the Berkshire section of Victoria County History, Peter Ditchfield and William Henry Page write that at this point [...] "the correct tenure had evidently been lost". Through Drew Sambourne's granddaughter, Margaret, the manor passed through marriage to William Windsor, 2nd Baron Windsor. William's grandson, Henry (5th Baron Windsor), sold the manor to Anthony Blagrave by the early 16th century.|$|E

Crowley insulted his close Jewish friend Victor Neuburg using anti-Semitic slurs and he had mixed opinions about Jews as a group. Although he praised their [...] "sublime" [...] poetry and stated that they exhibited [...] "imagination, romance, loyalty, probity and humanity", he also thought that centuries of persecution had led some Jews to exhibit [...] "avarice, servility, falseness, cunning and the rest".

500|$|The dual {{joystick}} {{design was}} developed by Jarvis, and resulted from two experiences in Jarvis's life: an automobile accident and playing Berzerk. Prior to beginning development, Jarvis injured his right hand in an accident—his hand was still in a cast {{when he returned to}} work, which prevented him from using a traditional joystick with a button. While in rehabilitation, he thought of Berzerk. Though Jarvis enjoyed the game and similar titles, he was dissatisfied with the control scheme; Berzerk used a single joystick to move the on-screen character and a button to fire the weapon, which would shoot the same direction the character was facing. Jarvis noticed that if the button was held down, the character would remain stationary and the joystick could be used to fire in any direction. This method of play inspired Jarvis to add a second joystick dedicated to aiming the direction projectiles were shot. Jarvis and DeMar created a prototype using a Stargate arcade system board and two Atari 2600 controllers attached to a control panel. In retrospect, Jarvis considers the design a <b>contradiction</b> <b>that</b> blends [...] "incredible freedom of movement" [...] with ease of use.|$|E

Paul Kolnik in USA Today enjoyed the <b>contradiction</b> <b>that</b> Green Day's [...] "massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season". Time magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score [...] "is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered, [...] there's enough variety. ... Where the show fall short is as a fully developed narrative." [...] He concluded that [...] "American Idiot, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains {{little more than an}} annotated rock concert. ... Still, [...] deserves at least two cheers – for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway." [...] Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, in his review of American Idiot, wrote [...] "Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won’t know what hit you. American Idiot knows no limits—it's a global knockout." [...] The musical has been nominated for three Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for a number of Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards.|$|E
