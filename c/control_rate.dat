25|$|There are {{two ways}} to {{approach}} these symptoms using drugs: rate control and rhythm <b>control.</b> <b>Rate</b> control seeks to reduce the heart rate to one that is closer to normal, usually 60 to 100bpm, without trying to convert to a regular rhythm. Rhythm control seeks to restore with cardioversion the regular heart rhythm and maintain it with drugs. Studies suggest that rhythm control is mainly a concern in newly diagnosed AF, while rate control is more important in the chronic phase. Rate control with anticoagulation is as effective a treatment as rhythm control in long term mortality studies, the AFFIRM Trial.|$|E
25|$|The Gerbich antigen {{system is}} an {{integral}} membrane protein of the erythrocyte and plays a functionally important role in maintaining erythrocyte shape. It also acts as the receptor for the P. falciparum erythrocyte binding protein. There are four alleles of the gene which encodes the antigen, Ge-1 to Ge-4. Three types of Ge antigen negativity are known: Ge-1,-2,-3, Ge-2,-3 and Ge-2,+3. persons with the relatively rare phenotype Ge-1,-2,-3, are less susceptible (~60% of the <b>control</b> <b>rate)</b> to invasion by P. falciparum. Such individuals have a subtype of a condition called hereditary elliptocytosis, characterized by oval or elliptical shape erythrocytes.|$|E

2500|$|In {{patients}} with AF where rate control drugs are ineffective {{and it is}} not possible to restore sinus rhythm using cardioversion, non-pharmacological alternatives are available. For example, to <b>control</b> <b>rate</b> it is possible to destroy the bundle of cells connecting the upper and lower chambers of the heart - the atrioventricular node - which regulates heart rate, and to implant a pacemaker instead. This [...] "ablate and pace" [...] technique has an important place in the treatment of AF< as it is the only reliably effective method for relieving the symptoms of the arrhythmia and can be used when other methods have failed (as they do in up to 50% of cases of persistent AF). Although this procedure results in a regular (paced) heart rhythm it does not prevent the atria from fibrillating and therefore long-term warfarin anticoagulation may still be required.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a region-based video codec, which {{is compatible with}} the H. 263 + standard, and its associated <b>rate</b> <b>control</b> algorithm for low variable-bit-rate (VBR) video. The proposed region-based coding scheme is a hybrid method that incorporates traditional block DCT coding as well as object-based coding. To achieve this, we adopt H. 263 + as the platform, and de-velop a fast macroblock-based segmentation method to implement the new region-based codec. The associated <b>rate</b> <b>control</b> solution includes <b>rate</b> <b>control</b> in three levels: encoding frame selection, frame-layer <b>rate</b> <b>control</b> and macroblock-layer <b>rate</b> <b>control.</b> The goal is to improve human visual perceptual quality at low bit rates. The efficiency of the proposed <b>rate</b> <b>control</b> algorithm applied to the region-based H. 263 + codec is demonstrated via several typical test sequences. I...|$|R
50|$|Verbesina occidentalis is {{considered}} problematic for farmers. The legume and hay field farmers {{seem to be}} some of the most negatively affected by Verbesina occidentalis due to competition. In some sever cases farmers will see a reduction in crop yields. In the past natural forms of control has been used. The use of goats for control of Verbesina occidentalis is unsuccessful since the goats will not consume the plant. The most successful form of control are herbicides. Verbesina occidentalis can be controlled at a ninety three percent rate with two pints per acre of Grazon P+D herbicide. Reedem R&P herbicide was not as potent to Verbesina occidentalis. It took at least three pints of Redeem R&P to achieve the ninety three percent <b>control</b> <b>rate.</b> Crossbow 2,4-D alone would control Verbesina occidentalis up to a rate of eighty three percent. However, when Benvel herbicide is used alone the <b>control</b> <b>rate</b> for Verbesina occidentalis is less than fifty percent. There are many other herbicides that have used to control Verbesina occidentalis but, none had a profound impact.|$|E
