25|$|Custer persisted {{with his}} design {{and built the}} second example N5855V at the Custer <b>Channel</b> <b>Wing</b> Corp factory. It again used a Baumann Brigadier {{fuselage}} and tail assembly. Although several firms expressed interest in production of the design, all failed to provide sufficient funds. This aircraft first flew on 19 June 1964.|$|E
2500|$|The Custer CCW-5 was a twin-engined, 5-seat {{aircraft}} of pusher configuration, {{which used}} a <b>channel</b> <b>wing</b> claimed to enable low speed flight and short take-offs. [...] Two CCW-5s flew, eleven years apart, but the type never entered production.|$|E
2500|$|In most {{situations}} an aircraft's lift comes chiefly {{from the}} low pressure generated on the upper surface by the locally enhanced higher air velocity. [...] This latter {{may be the result}} of the movement of the aircraft through the air or, when lift at low air speeds is important for short take-off performance, produced by engine power. The <b>channel</b> <b>wing,</b> the brainchild of [...] Willard Ray Custer, is an example of the latter, where the air velocity over the upper surface velocity in a U-shaped channel formed out of the wing was increased with a pusher propeller at the trailing edge. [...] This near semi-circular channel laterally constrained the airflow produced by the propeller, even when the aircraft was at rest, producing higher flow velocities than over a conventional pusher wing. [...] The need for wing mounted pusher engines made a pusher twin a natural configuration, and for his third <b>channel</b> <b>wing</b> design Custer chose to modify the existing Baumann Brigadier, a 5-seat mid wing pusher twin which itself did not reach production.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{evaluation of}} performance parameters in the turbulent regime {{with regard to}} the enhancement of heat transfer using winglet-type vortex generators has been accomplished in this study. The heat transfer characteristics and flow structure in turbulent flow throught a rectangular <b>channel</b> containing built-in <b>wing</b> type vortex generator, have been investigated experimentally in the range of Reynolds number between 3, 000 and 30, 000. The geometrical conguration of interest is reminiscent of single element of a plate-n cross-flow heat exchanger. The installation of wings is organized, {{in such a way that}} periodically interrupted enlarged and contracted channel flow domains can be established. Thus, each inglet pair acts as periodically interrupted divergent and convergent short channels in a rectangular <b>channel.</b> <b>Wings</b> were aligned at various angles of = 7 - 20 positively and negatively with the direction of main air flow direction. Each winglet pair induce longitudinal vorticity behind it, and strong mixing eects occur in a buer region between divergent and convergent channel arrangements. The vortices in these flow domains cause enhanced heat transfer. It is observed that, the enhancement of heat transfer caused the increment of the friction coecient...|$|R
2500|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Custer formed the Custer <b>Channel</b> <b>Wing</b> Corporation {{to develop and}} build the five-seat CCW-5 design which was {{intended}} for commercial sale. The first example N6257C was designed by Custer but built by the Baumann Corporation of Santa Barbara, California. It utilised an adapted fuselage and tail assembly of a Baumann Brigadier. Power was from two pusher 225 h.p. Continental O-470 engines. The first flight was made on 13 July 1953.|$|E
2500|$|Willard Custer filed a United States patent in 1929 for a wing design {{incorporating}} a semi-circular channel or [...] "half barrel" [...] shape {{in which an}} engine was to be fitted in pusher mode. Custer claimed that this layout, the <b>channel</b> <b>wing,</b> which gave STOL operating capabilities, resulted in a design [...] "which is an aircraft not an airplane. It does not plane the air to fly, rather it brings the air to the lift surfaces and reduces pressure to fly at 8 to 11 mph" ...|$|E

50|$|The Antonov An-181, or {{also called}} Handiwork 181, is an {{experimental}} aircraft built by OKB Antonov in Kiev {{in the late}} 1980s. Due {{to the collapse of}} the Soviet Union, the project was terminated {{because of the lack of}} funds. An interesting feature of the aircraft are its unusual curved <b>wings,</b> the so-called <b>channel</b> <b>wings.</b> The aircraft has two seats next to each other, a conventional fixed landing gear, a V-tailplane and high-wing wing, which are equipped with a channel swing in the area of the propellers. The drive is carried out by means of shafts and deflection gearboxes, which transmit the power from the engine in the fuselage to the two-blade propellers. The aircraft received the registration СССР-190101 and is exhibited in the State Museum of Aviation of Ukraine. Willard Ray Custer had previously built airplanes with the same wing concept in the USA.|$|R

50|$|Custer {{continued}} {{to develop his}} ideas for the <b>Channel</b> <b>Wing</b> and in 1951 he formed the Custer <b>Channel</b> <b>Wing</b> Corporation with a registered address at 1905 West Washington Street, Hagerstown, Maryland. It was reported that Taylorcraft Inc of Conway, Pennsylvania were the first manufacturers to be licensed {{for the production of}} both military and private aircraft using the <b>Channel</b> <b>Wing</b> principles.|$|E
50|$|The Custer <b>Channel</b> <b>Wing</b> Corporation was an American {{aircraft}} manufacturer that specialized {{in the design}} of aircraft utilizing the <b>Channel</b> <b>wing.</b> The company was active between 1951 and the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>channel</b> <b>wing</b> {{includes}} {{a section of}} the wing forming a partial duct around or immediately behind a propeller. Flown since 1942 in prototype form only, most notably on the Custer <b>Channel</b> <b>Wing</b> aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The J-7 only {{reached its}} Soviet-designed {{capabilities}} {{in the mid}} 1980s. However, the fighter is affordable and has been widely exported as the F-7, often with Western systems incorporated, like the ones sold to Pakistan. There are over 20 different export variants of the J-7, {{some of which are}} equipped to use European weaponry, such as French R.550 Magic missiles. The Discovery <b>Channel's</b> <b>Wings</b> Over The Red Star series claims that the Chinese intercepted several Soviet MiG-21s en route to North Vietnam (during the Vietnam War), but these aircraft did not perform {{in a manner consistent with}} their original specifications, suggesting that the Chinese actually intercepted down-rated aircraft that were intended for export, rather than fully capable production aircraft. For this reason, the Chinese had to re-engineer the intercepted MiG-21 airframes in order to achieve their original capabilities. China later developed the Shenyang J-8 based both on the expertise gained by the program, and by utilizing the incomplete technical information acquired from the Soviet Ye-152 developmental jet.|$|R

50|$|Custer {{studied the}} phenomenon, and by 1928 {{he had made}} the first models of a wing with a half-tube-formed section instead of the usual wing profile. This was {{patented}} in 1929. Development of the half-tube <b>channel</b> <b>wing</b> was then refined further, and on November 12, 1942, the CCW-1 (Custer <b>Channel</b> <b>Wing</b> 1) airplane was flying for the first time. Custer built additional experimental aircraft; the last one was CCW-5, of which a few were manufactured in 1964.|$|E

50|$|The {{inspiration}} to the <b>channel</b> <b>wing</b> concept came in 1925, when Custer had observed how {{the roof of}} a barn was lifted during a very strong gust of wind. He started investigating the phenomenon, and by 1928 he had developed the first Model of a new air plane wing that he subsequently, in 1929, filed a patent for. This <b>channel</b> <b>wing</b> managed much lift even at very low airspeeds, and allowed start and landing on very short airfields.|$|E

5000|$|The {{principle}} of the <b>channel</b> <b>wing</b> was not well understood by many, especially at the time [...] Custer was a splendid experimenter and visionary, with many patents filed, {{but he did not}} have a strong theoretical and scientific background. The Custer Channelwing Corporation had to cease its activities, and the <b>channel</b> <b>wing</b> principle was mostly forgotten. Today, only two CCW aircraft survive. The CCW-1 is displayed at the Smithsonian´s National Air & Space Museum, Suitland, Maryland, while the CCW-5 is at the Mid-Atlantic Air Museum, Pennsylvania.|$|E
50|$|Custer's next {{aircraft}} was the CCW-2 {{which was an}} evolution of the CCW-1 as a single-seat test bed using the adapted fuselage of a Taylorcraft BC-12 light aircraft, replacing the original single engine with two pusher engines fitted {{each side of the}} fuselage and placed within <b>wing</b> <b>channels.</b> The sole example first flew on 3 July 1948 and made many test flights totaling about 100 hours.|$|R
50|$|Twelve {{culverts}} {{were noted}} and they vary in date and design. They include circular concrete pipes, larger rectangular pipes and modern rectangular section pipes. Some are single, some double {{depending on the}} expected water flow. Around each of the inlets is a rock <b>channel</b> and <b>wings</b> to guide the water {{into the mouth of}} the pipe and these have been individually designed for the particular site. Many have concrete end walls and loose concrete added to the surface. On the outlet side there is mostly a rock surround around the pipe and, if space, a concrete apron to prevent erosion. As with any functional road, there is evidence of a continuous upgrade of surface and culverts as required for safety but many of the original culverts survive.|$|R
25|$|The CCW-5 {{accommodated}} five persons, and {{its power}} plants are {{suspended in the}} centre of the 6ft-chord <b>wing</b> <b>channels</b> on tubular frameworks attached to the wing spars. The aircraft draws air through the channels at high velocity, decreasing pressure over the wings and increasing lift. The CCW-5 was claimed to be capable of flying at a sustained speed of 35mph. Production deliveries were scheduled to commence during 1965, but this was never achieved.|$|R
