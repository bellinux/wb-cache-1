5000|$|The K-Series was {{introduced}} in 1988 by Rover Group as a powerplant for the Rover 200 car. It was the second volume-production implementation of the low-pressure sand-casting (or LPS) technique in a new plant sited between East Works and Cofton Hackett. (The first volume application of the LPS process had been for the M-16 cylinder head, produced in South Works, adjacent to the former forge). The LPS process pumped liquid aluminium into a chemically-bonded sand mould from below. This reduced oxide inclusions and gave a <b>casting</b> <b>yield</b> of around 90%, compared with 60% for more conventional gravity casting processes. The process avoided many of the inherent problems of casting aluminium components and consequently permitted lower casting wall thickness and higher strength-to-weight ratios. However, the process required the use of heat-treated LM25 material which gave the engines {{a reputation for being}} fragile. An engine overheat would often result in the material becoming annealed and rendering the components scrap. The aluminium engine blocks were fitted with spun-cast iron cylinder liners that were initially manufactured by GKN's Sheepbridge Stokes of Chesterfield, but these were replaced by liners made by Goetze after some seminal research conducted by Charles Bernstein at Longbridge, which proved influential even to Ducati for their race engines. Unfortunately a large number of aftermarket engines, the so-called [...] "VHPD"s", were built with the old substandard GKNs by Minister, Lotus and PTP well after the Goetze liner's introduction to the production line in 2000.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for controlling {{the pressure of}} a molten metal when using {{a new type of}} iron casting method called sand mold press casting to realize high productivity and obtain high-quality products. The past test results using this method showed a <b>casting</b> <b>yield</b> of 90 % to 95 %, while conventional methods only show a <b>casting</b> <b>yield</b> of 60 % to 70 %. Although the press casting method does not require a sprue cup or runner channel casting defects such as metal penetration are often caused by the high pressure in the high-velocity pressing part of this casting process. Therefore, we proposed a pressure control method with a mathematical model of molten metal pressure, and with it we achieved experimental confirmation of the successful production of brake drums at different pressing temperatures. Results show that the proposed pressing control method can realize sound, penetration-free casting production. However, the theoretical analysis and design of this pressing process had not previously been studied sufficiently, and therefore this paper presents the theoretical design algorithm for the process as well as its experimental confirmation...|$|E

Casting experiments using riser sleeves are performed {{in order to}} measure temperatures in the liquid steel, the riser sleeve, and the sand mold.

40|$|This report {{presents}} work {{conducted on}} the following main projects tasks undertaken in the Yield Improvement in Steel Casting research program: Improvement of Conventional Feeding and Risering Methods, Use of Unconventional Yield Improvement Techniques, and Case Studies in Yield Improvement. Casting trials were conducted and then simulated using the precise casting conditions as recorded by the participating SFSA foundries. These results present a statistically meaningful set of experimental data on soundness versus feeding length. Comparisons between these casting trials and casting trials performed {{more than forty years}} ago by Pellini and the SFSA are quite good and appear reasonable. Comparisons between the current SFSA feeding rules and feeding rules based on the minimum Niyama criterion reveal that the Niyama-based rules are generally less conservative. The niyama-based rules also agree better with both the trials presented here, and the casting trails performed by Pellini an d the SFSA years ago. Furthermore, the use of the Niyama criterion to predict centerline shrinkage for horizontally fed plate sections has a theoretical basis according to the casting literature reviewed here. These results strongly support the use of improved feeding rules for horizontal plate sections based on the Niyama criterion, which can be tailored to the casting conditions for a given alloy and to a desired level of soundness. The reliability and repeatability of ASTM shrinkage x-ray ratings was investigated in a statistical study performed on 128 x-rays, each of which were rated seven different times.

40|$|Molten metal {{processing}} is inherently energy intensive and roughly 25 % {{of the cost}} of die-cast products can be traced to some form of energy consumption [1]. The obvious major energy requirements are for melting and holding molten alloy in preparation for casting. The proper selection and maintenance of melting and holding equipment are clearly important factors in minimizing energy consumption in die-casting operations [2]. In addition to energy consumption, furnace selection also influences metal loss due to oxidation, metal quality, and maintenance requirements. Other important factors influencing energy consumption in a die-casting facility include geographic location, alloy(s) cast, starting form of alloy (solid or liquid), overall process flow, <b>casting</b> <b>yield,</b> scrap rate, cycle times, number of shifts per day, days of operation per month, type and size of die-casting form of alloy (solid or liquid), overall process flow, <b>casting</b> <b>yield,</b> scrap rate, cycle times, number of shifts per day, days of operation per month, type and size of die-casting machine, related equipment (robots, trim presses), and downstream processing (machining, plating, assembly, etc.).

In a die-casting enterprise, decisions regarding these issues are made frequently and are based on a large number of factors.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is developed}} to relate measured shrinkage porosity levels in steel castings to predictions from casting simulations, {{in order to}} determine feeding distances. Low-alloy steel casting trials were conducted to acquire a statistically meaningful set of experimental data for top-risered cast steel sections having various ASTM shrinkage X-ray levels. Simulations of the casting trials were then performed, using casting data recorded at the foundries during the trials. The actual casting soundness resulting from these trials, measured in terms of the ASTM shrinkage X-ray level, is quantitatively compared to the soundness predicted by simulations, measured in terms of a local thermal parameter known as the Niyama criterion. A relationship is shown to exist between the X-ray level and both the minimum Niyama criterion value as well as the area (in the plane of the X-ray) with Niyama values below a threshold value. Once the correlations developed in Part I of this article were established, an extensive set of additional casting simulations was performed to determine the feeding distances for castings {{with a wide variety of}} casting parameters.

Based on this, we limit the sharing of forecasts to computers within the same geographical area. To find computers with relevant forecasts, we will find most of them at computers located within a limited geographical region. These computers can be located quickly by scanning for them every time forecasts are needed. This approach scales with respect to the number of forecasters by limiting interaction to geographical regions. It also removes the need to maintain a list of computers with relevant forecasts...|$|R

The personal computer, emission spectrometer, thermal analysis, cold-box core system and automatic vertical moulding were introduced into the foundry industry. Experience shows that these new technologies do not always match up with malleable iron. Solidification and mould filling simulation programs are not always capable to handle a low carbon equivalent iron like malleable iron. Recent developments show however by using these new technologies and combined with practical experience, {{it is possible to}} increase the <b>casting</b> <b>yield</b> of malleable iron to the same level as ductile iron. The mechanical properties, especially the yield strength of malleable iron according to the standard are equivalent to those of ductile iron, however the yield strength of oil quenched malleable iron is significantly higher than that of ductile iron. An extensive investigation is made between ductile iron, air quenched and oil quenched malleable irons based on the properties of more than 350 test bars produced under the same conditions.

40|$|During solidification, contractions or {{distortions of}} the steel, known as ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂdimensional changes,ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ {{can cause the}} final product to vary {{significantly}} from the original pattern. Cracks in the casting that form during the late stages of solidification, called ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂhot tears,ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ occur when contractions {{can no longer be}} accommodated by residual liquid metal flow or solid metal displacement. Dimensional changes and hot tears are major problems in the steel casting industry. These occurrences are difficult to anticipate and correct using traditional foundry engineering methods. While dimensional changes are accommodated using pattern allowances, the desired dimensions are often inaccurate. Castings that form hot tears must then be scrapped or weld repaired, expending unnecessary energy. Correcting either of these problems requires a tedious trial-and-error process that may not necessarily yield accurate results. A model that predicts hot tears and dimensional changes during steel casting solidification has been successfully developed and implemented in commercial casting and stress analysis software. This model is based on a visco-plastic constitutive model with damage, where the damage begins to form when liquid feed metal is cut off to a solidifying region. The hot tear prediction is a locater for hot tear initiation sites, and not a full tear prediction: casting regions with relatively high damage values indicate where a casting is more likely to tear. In addition to model development, experimental castings were designed and produced, to provide both hot tear and dimensional change data during casting solidification and cooling. In both experimental castings and industrial production castings, regions of high damage were seen to correlate reasonably well with hot tear locations. Reasonable prediction of dimensional changes was also seen. The predictive capability of the model will improve with the development of more accurate high-temperature mechanical properties. The hot tear/dimensional change model provides the steel casting industry with a tool that will result in a reduction of scrapped castings and re-work/repair due to dimensional changes or hot tears, and also an increase in <b>casting</b> <b>yield</b> due to a reduction in the use of padding and improved placement of risers, leading to better riser efficiency.

These materials have a wide range of applications due to their properties. They can be used as catalyst supports, filters for hot gases and molten metals [3]. Filtration is the process of seperating solid particles from the melt, with the solid particles being captured on the filter and the liquid phase passing through the filter [4]. Filtration improves the surface finish and pressure tightness of castings and improves mechanical properties of the castings. It reduces the rework on castings, increases machinability and improves <b>casting</b> <b>yield.</b> There are several established filter technologies presently on the market. These include strainer cores, woven cloth or mesh, and ceramic tile filters. Ceramic tile filters are generally considered to be the most effective [5]. The permeability of porous ceramics is determined by the manufacturing process and pore structure. The use of conventional gating systems even with generously dimensioned runner bars is not sufficient to retain enough slag and suspended reaction to meet the high quality standards of today’s castings [6]...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: {{the rate}} at which the orbit matures is not well-documented. Limiting this pursuit are the {{difficulties}} inherent in measuring orbital volumes accurately. This study compared 3 common methods of determining orbital volume and sought to identify an accurate, practical manner for doing so. Methods: the volume of 1 orbit of 8 human cadaver heads was independently measured using 3 different methods: 1) CT was performed, and images were analyzed with 3 -dimensional (3 D) volumetric software; 2) the same orbits were then exenterated and a silicone cast was taken. the cast volumes were measured by water displacement; 3) the orbits were then filled with 1 -mm glass beads that were transferred to a graduated cylinder where their volume was determined. the data were analyzed statistically. Results: Intraobserver agreements were good for both beads and casts. Interobserver agreements were good for both beads and CT (p > 0. 05). Values obtained using the bead method were equal to values obtained using the cast method (p > 0. 05). However, agreement between direct (orbital fillers and casts) and indirect measurements (radiographic techniques) was not satisfactory (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: Independent of method, determining orbital volume is inherently difficult owing to the hyperbolic parabola that is the orbit entrance; all methods require estimation. Glass beads and <b>casts</b> <b>yielded</b> more reproducible values but can only be used in cadavers. CT measurement is prone to error due to the variability of methodologies used but allows access to enormous testing populations. Interstudy comparison is currently not possible. CT volumetric software with strict universal standards for estimating the anterior limit of the orbit appears to be the best method of studying human orbital volumes.

40|$|Recently, {{industrial}} {{manufacturers have}} incorporated {{the use of}} single crystals {{in the first stage}} of power generation turbines. Additions of carbon (C), boron (B) and hafnium, (Hf) have been shown to improve <b>casting</b> <b>yields</b> in large, defect-prone components; however, their response to heat treatment is not fully understood.   A study was undertaken to evaluate three single crystal alloys for use in an industrial gas turbine (IGT). PWA 1484, CMSX- 8 (B/C) and CMSX- 486 were evaluated {{in order to understand the}} effects of the solution/homogenization anneal and the response of the historically grain boundary-strengthening, minor elements to heat treatment with the goal of reducing total heat treatment time. A heat treatment evaluation method was created utilizing optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs to measure the primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS) and[gamma]-[gamma]’ eutectic, carbide and porosity volume fractions using ImageJ. The chemical segregation which forms from the partitioning of elements during solidification and the reduction of segregation through heat treatment was measured by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Using the results of the heat treatment analysis method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), EPMA and JMatPro, a modified solution heat treatment was designed for CMSX- 8 (B/C) which produced a smaller eutectic volume fraction (5. 76 % ± 0. 71 %) than the industrially preferred heat treatment (7. 82 % ± 0. 29 %) in one fourth of the time. CMSX- 486 was found to be incapable of solution heat treatment, and was discarded from IGT consideration. An inverse relationship was found between the decrease in volume fraction of primary carbides caused by dissolution and the volume fraction of porosity increase during heat treatment of CMSX- 8 (B/C) and PWA 1484. A strain-assisted carbide dissolution mechanism was proposed resultingin an increase in solidus suppressing solute species. Localized melting occurred throughout homogenization heat treatments resulting in porosity generation and was attributed to the increase in solute concentrations. A pre-solution anneal stress-relieving heat treatment was designed which reduced the porosity generation in PWA 1484 by 41. 1 %, over a similar solution annealed microstructure without a stress relieving heat treatment...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{molecular}} chromophore, p-SIDT(FBTThCA 8) 2, {{is introduced}} as an electron-donor material for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with broad absorption and near ideal energy levels {{for the use}} in combination with common acceptor materials. It is found that films <b>cast</b> from chlorobenzene <b>yield</b> devices with strongly s-shaped current–voltage curves, drastically limiting performance. We find that addition of the common solvent additive diiodooctane, in addition to facilitating crystallization, leads to improved vertical phase separation. This yields much better performing devices, with improved curve shape, demonstrating the importance of morphology control in BHJ devices and improving {{the understanding of the}} role of solvent additives...|$|R
