40|$|Equipment wear is a {{major concern}} in the mineral {{processing}} industry, which dramatically increases the maintenance cost and adversely affects plant operation efficiency. In this research, a novel surface treatment technology, laser surface engineering (LSE) surface coating process was proposed for the surface enhancement of selected mineral processing equipment. Microstructural and mechanical properties of the coated specimen were characterized. Laboratory-simulated wear tests were conducted to evaluate the tribological performance of the coated components. Test results indicate that the wear resistance of ASTM A 36 (raw <b>coal</b> <b>screen</b> section) and AISI 4140 steels can be increased 10 and 25 folds, respectively by the application of LSE process.

50|$|Rheola {{is a small}} {{settlement}} in the county of Neath Port Talbot. It is situated between Resolven and Glynneath, on the B4242. The Neath Canal, A465 and River Neath all pass nearby. The settlement consists of Rheola House and its ancillary buildings, and stables, sited alongside Rheola Brook, which joins the River Neath 500 metres to the south. The Rheola Estate {{was the site of}} an aluminium factory from 1939 to 1981, although mainly used for <b>coal</b> <b>screening</b> in later years. The Rheola factory buildings were then used as a weekly market. In 2014 permission was granted for building 46 houses on the factory site, as an enabling development to renovate and secure the Grade II* listed Rheola House.|$|R

2500|$|The {{colliery}} was {{witness to}} several accidents, {{some of them}} fatal. In 1886, a collier {{by the name of}} Hardaker was injured in or around the <b>coal</b> <b>screening</b> area. The accident resulted in Hardaker taking Fletcher, the owner to court. Although some private papers about the subsequent court case, Hardakers v Fletcher, have survived, none of the paperwork is dated other than by the year. At 2:30pm on 25 June 1902, a collier by the name of W. Scott was killed. [...] Scott was pulling down the roof with his under-manager, a {{man by the name of}} Brown when a [...] layer fell, bringing down the next layer and crushing Scott.

500|$|In 1935 the {{colliery}} {{was acquired}} by Manchester Collieries. It had large reserves of high-quality coal in the Roger mine below the seams already exploited, and although the mines dipped steeply, was a dry and relatively gas-free pit. Manchester Collieries initially improved <b>coal</b> <b>screening</b> but had plans to develop the colliery and maximise output to 4000 long tons (4480 short tons) per day, involving the complete replacement of the surface works. The Parker shaft was deepened to [...] between 1944 and 1948, and winding installed to accommodate 12-long ton (13.44-short ton) capacity skips. The transport of coal underground was improved by the installation of three-ton mine cars hauled by a battery-powered locomotive and a system of conveyors. A [...] reinforced concrete winding tower was built to house a Koepe-type friction wheel built by Metropolitan-Vickers.|$|R
50|$|Foxfield grew {{steadily}} {{under the}} ownership of the National Coal Board until it employed nearly 600 men by the mid-1950s. Output also peaked during this period at 210,813 tons in 1954. During this time the only Coal now Mined was The Big Dilhorne in the Dilhorne 19 and 20's Faces. The pit's surface buildings were again modernised and a new shower block for the miners was constructed, along with improvements in the <b>Coal</b> <b>screens</b> and washing facilities. However, output and manpower steadily decreased from the mid '50s peak and the colliery was finally closed in 1965. The majority of the miners were transferred to Florence Colliery in Longton, where a fully mechanised face in the Moss seam was prepared for the Cheadle miners. Some miners also transferred to Hem Heath Colliery in Trentham.|$|R

2500|$|With {{the rise}} of {{industrialisation}} and coalmining along the Neath valley, it no longer suited {{its role as a}} fashionable and picturesque residence. In the 20th century Rheola was the home of Col J. Edwards Vaughan at least until 1926. In 1939 the estate was bought by the British Aluminium Company, [...] who used the house as offices, and built an aluminium smelting plant on a large plot between the house and road. Aluminium smelting requires large amounts of electricity, and the original plan had been to use locally produced electricity, generated with local coal supplies. However World War II broke out before the generators were imported from Switzerland, so the smelting plant attempted to run using national grid electricity, and this was discontinued by 1943. The factory was then in use as a strip mill. The industrial activity had involved an area of hardstanding covering almost , which then was used for <b>screening</b> <b>coal</b> from the nearby coalmines. By 1981 it had ceased to be needed for <b>coal</b> <b>screening,</b> and the estate was sold to local construction and demolition company RM Rees. The industrial buildings were used for architectural salvage and a weekly market. The house was in serious decline, as were the grade II listed stables and coach house.|$|R

50|$|Coal {{breakers}} {{were generally}} located {{as close to}} the anthracite mine entrance as possible, so as to minimize the distance the coal had to travel before processing. Prior to entering the breaker, the coal would be crushed and sorted in a coal tipple and, if necessary and if water was available, washed. All <b>coal</b> was <b>screened</b> in the tipple as it came out of the mine so that steam-sized or smaller pieces could travel immediately to the coal washer and/or coal breaker. Chunks of coal which were too large were then crushed (sometimes several times) in the tipple until it passed through the screen (e.g., was of acceptable steam size or smaller).|$|R
40|$|GPR {{is widely}} used for ballast fouling identification, however, there are no robust {{guidelines}} to find the degree and type of fouling quantitatively. In this study, GPR {{studies were carried out}} on model and actual railway tracks using three ground coupled antennas and considering three fouling materials. Three ground coupled antennas viz., 100 MHz, 500 MHz and 800 MHz antennas were used for the initial survey and {{it was found that the}} 800 MHz ground coupled antenna is an optimum one to get quality results. Three major fouling materials viz., screened/broken ballast, coal and iron ore were used to construct prototype model sections, which were 1 / 2 of the actual Indian broad-gauge railway track. A separate model section has been created for each degree and type of fouling and GPR surveys were carried out. GPR study shows that increasing the fouling content results in a decrease in the Electromagnetic Wave (EMW) velocity and an increase in the dielectric constant. EMW velocity of ballast fouled with screened ballast was found to be more than coal fouled ballast and iron ore fouled ballast at any degree of fouling and EMW velocity of iron ore fouled ballast was found to be less than <b>coal</b> and <b>screen</b> ballast fouled ballast. Dielectric constant of iron ore fouled ballast was found to be higher than <b>coal</b> and <b>screen</b> ballast fouled ballast for all degrees of fouling. Average slope of the trend line of screen ballast fouled section is low (25. 6 degrees), coal fouled ballast is medium (27. 8 degrees) and iron ore fouled ballast is high (47. 6 degrees).

50|$|Foot {{roasting}} is {{a method}} of torture used since ancient times. The Romans immobilized the prisoner and pressed red-hot iron plates to the soles of their feet. The Spanish Inquisition frequently employed an enhanced technique, binding the prisoner face-upward to the rack with the bare feet secured in stocks. The soles of the feet were basted with lard or oil and slowly barbecued over a brazier of burning <b>coals.</b> A <b>screen</b> could be interposed between the feet and the coals to modulate the exposure, while a bellows controlled {{the intensity of the}} flame. Some of the Knights Templars are reputed literally to have been driven insane by the intensity and cruelty of the torture. Variants included placing slivers of hot coals between the toes, or suspending the prisoner head-downward and placing hot coals directly on the soles. Foot roasting remains a popular technique of torture to this day, though the modern variant typically makes use of a clothes iron applied to the soles, optionally complemented by the use of a soldering iron or electric wood-burning pencil to explore the delicate webbing between the toes.|$|R
