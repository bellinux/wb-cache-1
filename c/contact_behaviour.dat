40|$|A deeper {{understanding}} of biomechanical behaviour of human hands becomes fundamental for any human hand-operated Q 2 activities. The integration of biomechanical knowledge of human hands into product design process starts to play an increasingly important role in developing an ergonomic product-to-user interface for products and systems requiring high level of comfortable and responsive interactions. Generation of such precise and dynamic models can provide scientific evaluation tools to support product and system development through simulation. This type of support is urgently required in many applications such as hand skill training for surgical operations, ergonomic study of a product or system developed and so forth. The aim of this work is to study the <b>contact</b> <b>behaviour</b> between the operators’ hand and a hand-held tool or other similar contacts, by developing a novel and precise nonlinear 3 D finite element model of the hand and by investigating the <b>contact</b> <b>behaviour</b> through simulation. The <b>contact</b> <b>behaviour</b> is externalised by solving the problem using the bi-potential method. The human body’s biomechanical characteristics, such as hand deformity and structural behaviour, have been fully modelled by implementing anisotropic hyperelastic laws.

40|$|Feeding free-ranging native {{animals is}} a form of wildlife-based tourism that is {{particularly}} popular in Australia {{as a result of the}} cryptic nature of many native species. The colony of Mareeba rock-wallabies (Petrogale mareeba) at 'Granite Gorge', North Queensland, where tourists feed a spatially defined subset of animals daily, was studied to determine the effects of provisioning on their behaviour and body condition. Provisioned P. mareeba had higher activity levels, including higher aggression levels, and spent more time performing <b>contact</b> <b>behaviours</b> (including mutual and non-mutual allogrooming) than did non-provisioned animals. Possible explanations for increased aggression include competition over provisioned food and territorial defence. Increased <b>contact</b> <b>behaviours</b> may serve to reduce tension caused by provisioning. The diurnal activities of the provisioned rock-wallabies were dictated by the activities of tourists. Provisioned rock-wallabies emerged from their shelters to receive food much earlier each afternoon than did the unprovisioned animals. The level of autogrooming exhibited by the provisioned wallabies was much higher than that of the unprovisioned animals, presumably as a thermoregulatory response to the high afternoon temperatures. Although provisioned P. mareeba feed more, their higher activity levels explain the lack of difference in the body condition between the two groups...|$|R

An initial attempt {{has been made}} in surface engineered system design through combining the authors’ previous achievements in understanding surface engineering system contact mechanics. The approach is taken mainly from modelling the <b>contact</b> <b>behaviour</b> of multi layer surface coated system with real rough surface profiles in terms of contact stress and deformation and both boundary and finite element methods have been employed to understand the system <b>contact</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Experimental investigations had also been carried out on the performance of surface engineered gears (steel and titanium). For steel gears, tests had been carried out on the untreated, TiN coated, plasma nitrided and duplex treated under dry running conditions and it had been shown that the duplex system is the best in wear resistance among the others. For titanium gears, experimental tests had been carried out on untreated and thermal oxidized (TO) titanium against steel gears and the TO treated showed a significant wear improvement compared to that for the untreated.

It {{is difficult to}} detect the propagation of P 2 P botnets by isolated monitoring on individual machines due to its decentralised control structure. In this paper, we propose a contact tracing chain-based framework to detect and block P 2 P botnets by tracing <b>contact</b> <b>behaviours</b> among peers. In the proposed framework, the contacts of peers with suspicious symptoms are traced and tracing chains are established to correlate contacts among peers with their abnormal symptoms. Peers are confirmed with infections when the length of contact tracing chain that they belong to reaches a preset threshold. Under this framework, we develop different detection, tracing and immunisation strategies. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed contact tracing framework can quickly detect and block the propagation of P 2 P botnets...|$|R

Both contact (head thrusting, biting and pushing) and non-contact (chasing, threat and displacement) agonistic behaviours were recorded.

40|$|An exact {{analysis}} is conducted for periodic, two-dimensional (2 D) contact of piezoelectric {{materials in contact}} with a rigid body with a wavy surface pressed by uniform stresses at infinity. For three cases of eigenvalue distribution, three harmonic functions automatically satisfying the periodicity conditions are carefully constructed to facilitate the derivation of {{the solution of the}} considered problem. The stresses and electric displacements are obtained as infinite series. It is found that for the full contact case, the disturbance stress and electric displacement fields remain only the first harmonic which has the slowest decay in the y-direction. The convergence behaviours of the infinite series are checked, which shows that the external loading p and different positions have a great effect on the convergence behaviours of the infinite series and 400 terms are enough to get accurate solution at each position. Numerical results are presented to justify the validity of the present derivation and show the effect of the external loading on the <b>contact</b> <b>behaviours...</b>|$|R

40|$|Environmental factors, {{especially}} {{humidity and}} temperature, may influence wheel/rail <b>contact</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{by changing the}} friction coefficient, resulting in railway rolling noise changes. Friction modifiers (FMs) are now commonly used in the railway industry to manage and/or mitigate rail roughness growth and high noise levels in curves. Although the three factors {{have the potential to}} reduce rolling noise, there is little corresponding quantification of their effects available. In this paper, a series of experiments were performed with a two disk test rig to investigate their effect on rolling noise. A Railway Rolling Noise Prediction Software (RRNPS) model is then modified to simulate it. It is noted that the effect of humidity, temperature and FMs is small to negligible under the present conditions tested. However, through comparisons between simulations and measurements, the modified RRNPS model can reasonably predict the trend of the three factors effect on rolling noise. This may provide useful insight to the control of railway noise...|$|R

40|$|SiC is a {{promising}} {{wide bandgap semiconductor}} material for active electronic devices. An important problem is the formation of low resistance ohmic contacts, especially for p-type SiC. The deposition of all known metals onto p-type SiC will always result in a depletion p-type contact. We developed a model for p-depletion contact to SiC. Only 1 % of the introduced acceptors are ionised at room temperature. To {{increase the amount of}} acceptors a very shallow p-dopant implantation were performed. Another aim of this research was to study the structural and chemical changes of the surface, as well as the interface and bulk after implantation, annealing and contact formation. We performed complex solid state analysis involving Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Reflection of High Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Rutherford Backscattering (RBS). The contact resistance was measured at rectangular and circular structures using the transmission line method. It is obvious that the <b>contact</b> <b>behaviour</b> becomes ohmic with the Al/Ti metallisation. WSi_ 2 metallisation created a non ohmic <b>contact</b> <b>behaviour</b> before and after contact annealing, only at higher operating temperatures an ohmic character is found.

Potential cognitive demands include {{the need to develop}} social strategies involving the recognition {{of a large number of}} individuals and their relationships with others. Patterns of alliance affiliation among males may be more complex than are currently known for any non-human, with individuals participating in 2 – 3 levels of shifting alliances. Males mediate alliance relationships with gentle <b>contact</b> <b>behaviours</b> such as petting, but synchrony also plays an important role in affiliative interactions. In general, selection for social intelligence in the context of shifting alliances will depend on the extent to which there are strategic options and risk. Extreme brain size evolution may have occurred more than once in the toothed whales, reaching peaks in the dolphin family and the sperm whale. All three ‘peaks’ of large brain size evolution in mammals (odontocetes, humans and elephants) shared a common selective environment: extreme mutual dependence based on external threats from predators or conspecific groups. In this context, social competition, and consequently selection for greater cognitive abilities and large brain size, was intense...|$|R
40|$|A {{range of}} {{factors have been}} {{associated}} with challenging behaviour in people with intellectual disability (ID). In general, the literature has been dominated by three approaches that have been proposed to explain the causes of challenging behaviour: applied behaviour analysis, biological factors, and psychiatric disorders. Although challenging behaviour has received substantial research attention, the research has been limited because of a focus on single causes. Focussing on only single causes of challenging behaviour provides only incomplete explanations because it fails to explore possible interactions between causes. The motivation of the current study was to address this limitation and use an approach that enabled investigation of potential interactions of various factors that had previously been identified in the literature as contributing to challenging behaviour. The aim of the research was, therefore, {{to determine the extent to}} which mental health, physical health, communication, learnt function of behaviour, severity of disability, living arrangement, age, and gender predicted challenging behaviour. Seventy-four adults with ID and their paid carers were recruited into the study. Data about each factor were collected using a combination of carer completed questionnaires and interviews, and direct observation and assessments of each participant with ID. For 12 participants, a second carer was recruited to provide inter-rater reliability data. Multiple measures were used for challenging behaviour, mental health, and learnt function of behaviour because of the paucity of sound measures appropriate for this population. The selection of one measure for mental health and learnt function of behaviour, for use in a multiple regression to address the research question, was based on inter-rater reliability and concurrent validity. Because many of the measures selected comprised subscale scores and in light of sample size requirements, the number of independent variables retained were reduced using further analyses. Based on these analyses, the variables retained as independent variables for multiple regression were severity of disability, Anxiety and Depressive scores, and Sensory, Escape and Attention scores. For challenging behaviour, a single measure could not be selected due to the shared variance across the measures. Factor analysis was, therefore, used to explore the underlying construct(s) being tapped. The results of the factor analysis revealed the presence of two components that were labelled <b>contact</b> and non-contact <b>behaviours.</b> The scores on these components were subsequently used as the dependent variables; hence two multiple regression equations were conducted. The results of the standard multiple regression revealed that <b>contact</b> <b>behaviours</b> were predicted by Anxiety scores and severity of disability: higher scores on <b>contact</b> <b>behaviours</b> were associated with more severe disability and higher Anxiety scores. In addition to severity of disability and Anxiety scores, non-contact behaviours were also predicted by Sensory scores: higher non-contact behaviours scores were associated with higher Anxiety scores, greater disability, and higher Sensory scores. These results indicate that challenging behaviour is influenced by a combination of factors. A recommendation based on these results is that a variety of factors be considered in formulations of possible reasons for challenging behaviour...|$|R
