5|$|In {{completing}} missions, {{the player}} can have Talion engage in melee, ranged combat, and stealth approaches, with some missions rewarding the player more for completing the mission {{in a specific}} manner. Talion's ranger abilities are enhanced through Celebrimbor, allowing the player to mix combat with special focus-based attacks; these latter attacks {{can be used to}} slow time down while aiming with the bow, drain focus out of an enemy foe, or, later in the game, brand the foe to become an ally of Talion. The combat system uses an attack-chain system that enables the player to perform special moves after building the chain to a large enough value, such as instantly draining a foe of focus or performing an area focus attack. With the combat system, they can also counter and dodge attacks. Stealth is a <b>critical</b> <b>element</b> in some missions; several areas are considered Strongholds and should Talion's presence be discovered, an alarm will sound and more Uruks will arrive to try to kill him.|$|E

40|$|Outsourcing {{of supply}} network {{elements}} have been increased by companies {{as a potential}} solution to aid increasing competitive advantage. Companies are more dependent on their service providers, if {{the majority of their}} product or service elements are outsourced. This typically increases supply risk profiles. Outsourcing of knowledge rich, supply <b>critical</b> <b>elements</b> in supply networks creates substantial impact on a companies’ network. Companies with high risk profiles can typically exhibit a knock on effect in revenue. It is essential for manufacturing companies to analyze the risks linked with outsourcing of knowledge rich, supply <b>critical</b> <b>elements.</b> This research study examines the probability of risk event occurrences associated with outsourcing of knowledge rich, supply <b>critical</b> <b>elements</b> on the long term sustainability of the network. A list of knowledge rich, supply <b>critical</b> <b>elements</b> in supply networks were determined to align to the industry study carried out. The methodology consists of the development of evaluating value at risk probabilities for listed supply network elements, through the formation of Bayesian networks and with use of basic probability concepts. Transferring of knowledge is determined as an uncertain process in outsourcing. Outsourcing of knowledge rich, supply <b>critical</b> <b>elements</b> was found to be limited within the Sri Lankan manufacturing sector. Probabilities of impact on monitory values relative to outsourcing in a company were investigated and it was determined that the impact on the long term sustainability of the network was substantial. The methodology directs manufacturers to make decisions on outsourcing of knowledge rich, supply <b>critical</b> <b>elements</b> and implement risk mitigation plans to maintain competitive advantage within their supply network...|$|R

The supercharger's installation, the detail work of which having been performed by Clifford Tinson, was a two-stage system; the first-stage compressor was permanently engaged, but the second-stage incorporated clutches which enabled it to be manually engaged by the pilot upon attaining the correct height. This arrangement was necessary to avoid administering an excessively dense mixture to the cylinders when flown at low altitudes.

25|$|The {{arrival of}} Pyrrhus {{triggered}} a widespread revolt {{by the southern}} socii, the Samnites, Lucani and Bruttii. But the revolt was far from universal. The Campanians and Apulians largely remained loyal to Rome. This was probably due to their long-standing antagonism to the Samnites and Tarentines respectively. Neapolis, the key Greek city on the Tyrrhenian, also refused to join Pyrrhus, due to its rivalry with Tarentum. This demonstrates a <b>critical</b> <b>element</b> {{in the success of}} Rome's military confederation: the socii were so divided by mutual antagonisms, often regarding their neighbours as far greater threats than the Romans, that they were never able to stage a universal revolt. The pattern {{is similar to that of}} the next great foreign challenge, Hannibal's invasion of Italy (see below). The central Italians (Etruscans and Umbrians) remained loyal, while the southern Italians, with significant exceptions, rebelled. The exceptions were also the similar, save for the Campanians, who joined Hannibal in the later episode.|$|E
25|$|The NCB was {{encouraged}} to gear itself toward reduced subsidies in the early 1980s. After a strike was narrowly averted in February 1981, pit closures and pay restraint led to unofficial strikes. The main strike started on 6 March 1984 with a walkout at Cortonwood Colliery, {{which led to the}} NUM's Yorkshire area's sanctioning of a strike on the grounds of a ballot result from 1981 in the Yorkshire Area, which was later challenged in court. The union strategy was to cause a severe energy shortage of the sort that had won victory in the 1972 strike. The government strategy, designed by Margaret Thatcher, was threefold: to build up ample coal stocks, to keep as many miners at work as possible, and to use police to break up attacks by pickets on working miners. The <b>critical</b> <b>element</b> was the NUM's failure to hold a strike ballot, which enabled a minority to keep working and kept other unions from supporting it.|$|E

25|$|Retention is the {{principle}} that describes how well the denture is prevented from moving vertically {{in the opposite direction}} of insertion. The better the topographical mimicry of the intaglio (interior) surface of the denture base {{to the surface of the}} underlying mucosa, the better the retention will be (in removable partial dentures, the clasps are a major provider of retention), as surface tension, suction and friction will aid in keeping the denture base from breaking intimate contact with the mucosal surface. It is important to note that the most <b>critical</b> <b>element</b> in the retentive design of a maxillary complete denture is a complete and total border seal (complete peripheral seal) in order to achieve 'suction'. The border seal is composed of the edges of the anterior and lateral aspects and the posterior palatal seal. The posterior palatal seal design is accomplished by covering the entire hard palate and extending not beyond the soft palate and ending 1–2mm from the vibrating line.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the initial}} {{operational}} capability of the U.S. Navy's Polaris-armed Fleet Ballistic Missile submarines, the A-3 was the Navy's <b>critical</b> <b>element</b> in the U.S. nuclear deterrent. Squadrons were established in two Heavy Attack Wings (HATWINGs), with one wing initially established at NAS North Island, California before relocating to NAS Whidbey Island, Washington in December 1957 while the other wing was initially established at NAS Jacksonville, Florida before relocating to NAS Sanford, Florida. The wing at NAS Whidbey Island would disestablish in 1959 but the squadrons which had made up the wing would later transition to the EKA-3B variant, eventually forming the nucleus for the Navy's Grumman EA-6B Prowler community, while the wing at NAS Sanford would convert to the A3J Vigilante (later A-5A) in the nuclear heavy attack mission, followed by conversion to the RA-5C and transition to the reconnaissance attack mission. The Vigilante wing would also continue to retain {{a small number of}} TA-3B aircraft for training Naval Flight Officers in the Vigilante's radar and navigation systems. The Skywarrior's strategic bombing role faded after 1964, briefly being complemented by the A3J Vigilante. Soon afterward, the Navy abandoned the concept of carrier-based strategic nuclear weaponry for the successful Polaris missile-equipped Fleet Ballistic Missile submarine program and all A-5As were converted to the RA-5C Vigilante reconnaissance variant. Many A3B's were converted to a combination tanker-ECM aircraft.|$|E
