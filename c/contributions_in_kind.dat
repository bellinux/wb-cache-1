India rejected the American advice that it not recognise the Communist conquest of China, but it did back the US when it supported the 1950 United Nations resolution condemning North Korea's aggression in the Korean War. India tried {{to act as a}} broker to help end that war, and served as a conduit for diplomatic messages between the US and China. Meanwhile, poor harvests forced India to ask for American aid for its food security, which was given starting in 1950. In the first dozen years of Indian independence (1947–1959), the US provided $1.7 billion in aid, including $931 million in food. The Soviet Union provided about half as much in monetary terms, however made much larger <b>contributions</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> taking the form of infrastructural aid, soft loans, technical knowledge transfer, economic planning and skills involved in the areas of steel mills, machine building, hydro-electric power and other heavy industries especially nuclear energy and space research.

40|$|In the {{following}} article {{there have been}} presented the issues concerning the role, the objectives and the way of functioning of social construction associations (TBS). Great hopes have been set on the building activity pursued by such associations concerning a quick improvement of the housing situation of the society. Unfortunately, TBS {{are not able to}} fulfill the tasks they are charged with. Tenement flats account just for a few per cent {{of the total number of}} flats put into use and this situation is very unlikely to change in {{the following}} years. This does not result from the lack of interest in this form of building, but solely from the lack of loans granted by the National Housing Fund. The implementation of changes in the procedure concerning the service of a loan led to a decrease in the scale of the undertaken building activity as well as to the prolongation of the time required to receive an indispensable subsidy. Numerous changes in the act on selected forms of support for the housing construction or in the executory provisions also contribute to relentless confusion in the activity of social construction associations and cause problems connected with the appropriate planning of the future of the firms. At the same time, the establishment of social construction associations (TBS) by municipal communes, whereby a commune has got 100 % of shares, shows advantages and disadvantages of such a solution. A commune as a founder of a company bears all the costs connected with the investment of the initial capital of the company or with a <b>contribution</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind.</b> Sometimes being the owner of the company a commune may too strongly interfere in the activity of the association and „commission” it to carry out the tasks the commune is charged with. The Municipal Social Construction Association Ltd. in Płock can serve as an example whereby the company which is currently carrying out the construction of 300 council flats has practically stopped building tenement flats for the people registered in the Municipal Social Construction Association. Moreover, the costs of obtaining and maintaining a tenement flat are quite substantial and thus such flats are quite an expansive commodity affordable only by the people with a “medium high income”. Therefore, it is difficult to maintain that these flats are easy and cheap to rent. In spite of many problems connected with the tenement flats system, it is worth emphasizing that it is a needed segment of the housing market.
