5|$|The {{neutral zone}} {{that had been}} {{allocated}} to Belgian fans was largely occupied by Juventus supporters, {{many of whom were}} from the local Italian community. The neutral zone was in section Z, {{on the same side of}} the ground as the Liverpool fans. The two groups thus stood yards apart, separated only by chicken wire. At approximately 7p.m., missiles began to be thrown between the two sets of fans; because the stadium was crumbling, fans <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> stones up and throw them across the divide.|$|E
5|$|Ziggler {{entered the}} 2016 Royal Rumble as the 28th entrant, lasting 7 minutes, but was {{eliminated}} by the eventual winner, Triple H. The next night on Raw, Ziggler faced Kevin Owens in a losing effort, but defeated him {{the following two}} weeks in a row. On the February 15 Raw, Ziggler {{was involved in a}} fatal five-way match for the Intercontinental Championship, where Owens regained the title after pinning Tyler Breeze. At Fastlane, Ziggler challenged Owens to a match for the Intercontinental Championship, which he lost. In the following weeks, Ziggler began to re-ignite his feud with The Authority, and on the March 14 episode of Raw, he confronted Triple H and Stephanie McMahon. This resulted in Ziggler being granted a match against Triple H where if he won, he <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> his match at WrestleMania (excluding the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match); however, Ziggler lost. At WrestleMania 32, Ziggler competed against Kevin Owens, Sami Zayn, The Miz, Stardust, Sin Cara and Zack Ryder in a ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship, which was won by Ryder.|$|E

25|$|Starting from 1987, the NBA {{modified}} the lottery {{system so that}} only the first three picks were determined by the lottery.

25|$|Among {{the many}} Defender {{projects}} were several studies {{based on the}} concept that a re-entering nuclear warhead would cause unique physical signatures while still in the upper atmosphere. It was known that hot, high-speed objects caused ionization of the atmosphere that reflects radar waves, and it appeared that a warhead's signature would be different enough from decoys that a detector <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> out the warhead directly, or alternately, provide added information that would allow operators to focus a conventional tracking radar on the single return from the warhead.|$|E
25|$|During the infighting {{inside the}} city walls, a stockpiled supply of dry food was {{intentionally}} burned by the Zealots to induce the defenders {{to fight against the}} siege, instead of negotiating peace; as a result many city dwellers and soldiers died of starvation during the siege.

25|$|OSPF uses path cost as {{its basic}} routing metric, which {{was defined by}} the {{standard}} not to equate to any standard value such as speed, so the network designer <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> a metric important to the design. In practice, it {{is determined by the}} speed (bandwidth) of the interface addressing the given route, although that tends to need network-specific scaling factors now that links faster than 25 Mbit/s are common. Cisco uses a metric like 108/bandwidth (the reference value, 108 by default, can be adjusted). So, a 100Mbit/s link will have a cost of 1, a 10Mbit/s a cost of 10 and so on. But for links faster than 100Mbit/s, the cost would be <1.|$|E
25|$|Hayes' {{solution}} to the problem was to use a small microcontroller to implement a system that examined the data flowing into the modem from the host computer, watching for certain command strings. This allowed commands to be sent to and from the modem using the same data pins as {{all the rest of the}} data, meaning it would work on any system that could support even the most basic modems. The Smartmodem <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> up the phone, dial numbers, and hang up again, all without any operator intervention. The Smartmodem was not necessary for BBS use but made overall operation dramatically simpler. It also improved usability for the caller, as most terminal software allowed different phone numbers to be stored and dialed on command, allowing the user to easily connect to a series of systems.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{consider}} {{for instance}} the unit circle S, {{and the action}} on S by a group G consisting of all rational rotations. Namely, these are rotations by angles which are rational multiples ofπ. Here G is countable while S is uncountable. Hence S breaks up into uncountably many orbits underG. Using the axiom of choice, we <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> a single point from each orbit, obtaining an uncountable subset X of S with the property that all of its translates by G are disjoint fromX. The set of those translates partitions the circle into a countable collection of disjoint sets, which are all pairwise congruent. Since X is not measurable for any rotation-invariant countably additive finite measure on S, finding an algorithm to select a point in each orbit requires the axiom of choice. See non-measurable set for more details.|$|E

25|$|England {{felt they}} {{probably}} {{still had a}} chance of victory if they <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> up quick wickets, {{and set up a}} low final day run chase, but would otherwise be looking for the draw. Things began brightly for England when Geoff Marsh was caught behind for only 6 off Neil Foster's bowling. But from then on David Boon and Mark Taylor looked determined to put the game out of England's reach, until Taylor was out for a well made 60 leaving Australia at 97 for 2. Captain Allan Border came in and looked determined to lead from the front, scoring at a fast rate, and when Boon was out for 43, Dean Jones emerged from the dressing room looking even more determined. The pair moved along at a rapid rate, taking Australia to 158 for 3 at stumps.|$|E
25|$|In the UK and Ireland, to {{coincide}} with the game's launch, GameStop exclusively sold the 320GB 'Classic White' PlayStation 3 system in stores across Ireland and the UK, since GameStop obtained the exclusive right to sell the console on September 9, 2011.

For mainland UK buyers the console was only available online, while buyers in Ireland <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> it up in their local store. The console was also sold in GameStop stores in Europe, Micromania and EB Games Australia and e-commerce sites from November. In North America, {{to coincide}} with the game's launch, a limited edition hardware offering featured a 320GB 'Charcoal Black' PlayStation 3 system, a 'Charcoal Black' DualShock 3 controller, a free month of PlayStation Plus, and a copy of Uncharted 3.|$|E
25|$|Donop {{waited for}} two hours and sent a second {{surrender}} demand to the fort. When it was refused again, he prepared to attack. Donop ordered the Minningerode Grenadiers to attack the right or {{east side of the}} fort, the Mirbach Musketeers to assault the center, and the Linsing Grenadiers to charge the left or west side. He held the Lengerke Grenadiers in reserve. Jäger sharpshooters found positions where they <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> off the defenders. At 4:30 PM, the Hessian infantry advanced after a brief artillery bombardment. Donop led the Minningerode column which rushed into the abandoned eastern section of the fort. Though they were sprayed by grapeshot from American gunboats, the grenadiers forced their way into the abatis. At that moment, the defenders opened fire from point-blank range and simply mowed down the Germans. Despite the efforts of the officers to urge the men on, all three attacking columns were stopped with horrific losses and forced to retreat.|$|E
