30|$|The debt {{relations}} are {{to make use}} of the social time mechanism to create time differences between the two kinds of <b>capital</b> circulation <b>periods.</b> The first time <b>period</b> is the <b>capital</b> use <b>period,</b> that is, the social time period that maintains the daily social life of the workers of the households (such as the machinists) and the households. The second time <b>period</b> is the <b>capital</b> circulation <b>period</b> in the process of order production and transactions for the subcontractors or enterprises. As for the <b>capital</b> circulation <b>period</b> of enterprises, it is highly restricted by the repayment time point. Therefore, making the period of social time the most efficient <b>capital</b> circulation <b>period</b> for production and management ultimately becomes an important way for the party who holds market advantage to utilize and save capital effectively.|$|R
30|$|In {{the period}} of {{subcontracting}} {{there are two different}} kinds of <b>capital</b> circulation <b>periods</b> in the production capital chain (Fig.  3 presents more details). The first <b>capital</b> circulation <b>period</b> is between the material suppliers, the subcontractors, and the clients. The second is the circulation period between the subcontractors and the households. The latter adjusts itself according to the period from production to sale, which means adjusting according to {{the period of}} orders. Generally speaking, in Pu Town, the period from the material purchase to the production of white fabric and delivery to the clients lasts from 2 to 3  months. In the case of foreign transactions, the time for dyeing and finishing as well as export transportation must be added into the whole period, which amounts to about 45  days. Thus, for subcontractors working on foreign transactions, the <b>capital</b> circulation <b>period</b> of a batch of goods is roughly 4  months, while domestic transactions are about 2 to 3  months. The social time for the second <b>capital</b> circulation <b>period</b> in settling puts off the payment time as much as possible in regard to the speed of capital circulation, which makes the speed of the first <b>capital</b> circulation <b>period</b> go far beyond its circulation speed. It is basically suggested that the first <b>capital</b> circulation <b>period</b> does not need to pay the processing fee in full for the households timely after getting profits in trading. Instead, it saves a large part for daily circulating or capital accumulation.|$|R

30|$|As a result, we {{see that}} Algeria’s farmers are {{dependent}} on natural time rhythms as Bourdieu (1963) notes, which also indicates that social time still functions by creating a certain mechanism in another system. As Young (2002) argues, time {{is not only a}} dimension of social interaction but also an instrument of social interaction. Therefore, when social time occurs as a <b>capital</b> settlement <b>period</b> in a contract relation with no impact on the social economic life of either party, they are able to make remarkable progress. Thus, this <b>capital</b> settlement <b>period</b> according to social time is defined as social time mechanism. In the following text, the textile industry of Pu Town is taken as an example to clarify how SMEs that cooperate with the <b>capital</b> circulation <b>period</b> in production resort to the social time mechanism in solving the problem of capital shortage.|$|R
30|$|Enterprises {{could put}} off <b>capital</b> {{settlement}} <b>period</b> {{with the help}} of market power and the social network of processing. In other words, in solving the problem of capital shortage, enterprises can first be in debt to the upstream and repay after the draining of capital. Distinguished from loaning, this financing channel has its own advantages with no need to pay interest. Therefore, in adjusting the <b>capital</b> settlement <b>period</b> with the upstream, the subcontractors adopt social time accepted by the community as a settlement period, which helps them acquire the largest potential for capital circulation and accumulation.|$|R

30|$|Let us {{take a look}} at {{the first}} {{horizontal}} <b>capital</b> circulation <b>period.</b> The period for the value realization from material to product lasts about 3  months. Therefore, many textile enterprises (the large subcontractors) do not pay their workers in the first 3  months: the payment for the first month is distributed in the fourth month and so on. The remaining 3 -month payments are distributed at the end of the year, 13 which suggests that the payment for the first batch of goods at the beginning of a year is deferred for 3  months. As a result, the production and management period of orders is just right for the conventions of settlement prevalent in the community, such as settlements according to season. The 3 -month payment is deferred by taking advantage of the social time mechanism. The batches of production are lastingly cumulative, as a result of which the draining speed of capital in upstream transactions is still faster than the <b>capital</b> settlement <b>period</b> upstream. The social time mechanism plays a crucial role because the time period is settled according to the cooperation between the upstream and the downstream, that is, settled according to the settlement conventions instead of the consistency of economic production and the transaction period. Depending on these two kinds of <b>capital</b> circulation <b>periods,</b> the subcontractors not only accumulate capital but also effectively utilize their present capital.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a simple overlapping generations economy where {{the behavior of}} intermediaries, in a market characterized by asymmetric information and moral hazard, may give rise to cyclical equilibria. When capital increases output and savings also increase and therefore more capital {{will be available in}} the following period. At the same time, however, the higher supply of of savings leads to a decrease in the deposit interest rate and this will induce intermediaries to decrease the number of firms that are monitored. A larger number of firms will select low quality projects and, because of this, less capital will be produced in the following period. For some parameter values this second effect may prevail over the first one and the stock of <b>capital</b> in <b>period</b> t+ 1 may actually be lower than the stock of <b>capital</b> in <b>period</b> t.

30|$|From the {{perspective}} of relational contracts, debt is a phenomenon {{that emerged from the}} adjustment of the <b>capital</b> settlement <b>period</b> when the upstream and the downstream make use of social relations or market power. However, in fact, it is more complicated than that. For the enterprises in the community, if the time dimension within the contract is overlooked, {{it would be hard to}} illustrate clearly why the settlement period presents the character of social time only through social relations and market power As a result, by introducing the time dimension to explore the production capital chain in Pu Town, in reaching a settlement time on the basis of agreements, a more fundamental social economic life rhythm within the community is obeyed, even though both of the two parties resort to the relational contract to adjust the <b>capital</b> settlement <b>period.</b> It is also suggested that the result of consultation between individuals is a kind of nonindividual and social institution. Thus, occurrence of the social time mechanism indicates that the transaction relations motivate more fundamental social resources or institutions, bringing the contract relation into a deeper social mechanism. More significantly, the cases discussed in the text demonstrate that the social time mechanism further develops the discussion of contract theory.|$|R
