Bechler's death raised concerns over the use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. Ephedra was banned, and soon the furor died down.|$|E
500|$|Artemisinin was {{isolated}} by pharmacologist Tu Youyou (Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 2015). Tu headed a team tasked by the Chinese government with finding {{a treatment for}} choloroquine-resistant malaria. Their work was known as Project 523, named after the date it was announced – 23 May 1967. The team investigated more than 2000 [...] <b>Chinese</b> <b>herb</b> preparations and by 1971 had made 380 extracts from 200 herbs. An extract from qinghao (Artemisia annua) was effective but the results were variable. Tu reviewed the literature, including Zhou hou bei ji fang (A handbook of prescriptions for emergencies) written in 340 BC by Chinese physician Ge Hong. This book contained the only useful reference to the herb: [...] "A handful of qinghao immersed with two litres of water, wring out the juice and drink it all." [...] Tu's team subsequently isolated a nontoxic, neutral extract that was 100% effective against parasitemia in animals. The first successful trials of artemisinin were in 1979.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Chinese</b> <b>herbs</b> {{nephropathy}} is a {{new type}} of subacute interstitial nephropathy reported in women who had followed a slimming regimen including <b>Chinese</b> <b>herbs.</b> METHODS: We report the clinical presentation and follow-up of 15 cases and compare them with a control group of 15 women with interstitial nephropathies of other origins, matched for age, sex, and initial serum creatinine (mean 3 mg/dl). RESULTS: At presentation the <b>Chinese</b> <b>herbs</b> nephropathy group differed from the control group by a lower proteinuria (P = 0. 009), a more severe anaemia (P = 0. 002), and a higher prevalence of aortic insufficiency (42 % vs 0 %, P < 0. 05). It was further characterized by mild hypertension in 80 %, glycosuria and leukocyturia in 40 % and asymmetric kidneys in 54 % of the cases. During follow-up, deterioration of renal function was faster in the <b>Chinese</b> <b>herbs</b> nephropathy than in the control group (P < 0. 05). It was influenced by the duration of <b>Chinese</b> <b>herbs</b> treatment (P = 0. 037) and the delay between the end of <b>Chinese</b> <b>herbs</b> ingestion and diagnosis of the disease (P = 0. 013). In three cases, renal failure developed 3 years after <b>Chinese</b> <b>herbs</b> ingestion. Complications included severe aortic regurgitation requiring surgery (n = 1), urothelial carcinoma (n = 2), bilateral ureterohydronephrosis due to periureteral fibrosis (n = 1). Five patients with <b>Chinese</b> <b>herbs</b> nephropathy were successfully transplanted, without evidence of recurrence of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Chinese</b> <b>herbs</b> nephropathy is characterized by a lower proteinuria, more severe anaemia, and a faster progression to renal failure than other interstitial nephropathies. The duration of <b>Chinese</b> <b>herbs</b> treatment and interval between withdrawal of <b>Chinese</b> <b>herbs</b> and diagnosis are correlated with the rate of progression. Severe, unusual extrarenal complications may affect <b>Chinese</b> <b>herbs</b> nephropathy patients...|$|R

Perhaps she expected every visitor to come with a complaint of her unlucky Peregrine, but when Mrs. Woodford spoke cheerfully of being her neighbour in the country, she was evidently relieved and even gratified, prattling in a soft plaintive tone about her sufferings and the various remedies, ranging from woodlice rolled into natural pills, and grease off the church bells, to diamond dust and Goa stones, since, as she said, there was no cost to which Major Oakshott would not go for her benefit.

50|$|Herbal {{therapy is}} the use of {{therapeutic}} medicines derived from plants, animals, and substances occurring in the natural environment. Herbs are used to move Qi as well as tonify Yin and Yang. Yin and yang are equal yet opposing forces that occur in all naturally occurring phenomena. For instance, Yin corresponds to nighttime, cold, or resting of the body. Yang, on the other hand, corresponds to daytime, heat, and activity of the body. Whenever Yin or Yang becomes deficient or excessive, the balance of the body is lost, and disease results. Herbs are used to restore this natural balance. The Western equivalent to <b>Chinese</b> <b>herbs</b> is pharmaceutical drugs, such as antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines. Both western drugs and <b>Chinese</b> <b>herbs</b> are prescribed based on a medical diagnosis. Lately, Western herbals have become popular in the United States. However, distinct differences exist between Western and <b>Chinese</b> <b>herbs.</b> Western herbs are used in a singular form to treat symptoms of disease without a medical diagnosis. <b>Chinese</b> <b>herbs</b> are often a formula or mixture of herbs prescribed according to a medical diagnosis. Generally, in treating a patient, acupuncture is used in conjunction with herbal medicine.|$|R

The limitations of western medications have led us to explore herbal medicine. In particular, many <b>Chinese</b> <b>herbs</b> have demonstrated some interesting therapeutic properties.
