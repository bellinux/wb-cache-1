40|$|The {{radiation}} {{properties of}} nonpolar AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) were theoretically investigated by comparing them {{to those of}} <b>c-plane</b> AlGaN QWs with heavy holes as the top valence band (VB). First, the conditions to minimize the threshold carrier density of <b>c-plane</b> QW laser diodes were explored. A thin well width (∼ 1 nm) and reduction of the Al content in the well layer were important to reduce threshold carrier density because narrow wells suppressed the quantum confined Stark effect and AlGaN with a lower Al content had a lower density of states. Moreover, the emission wavelength was widely controlled by tuning the Al contents of both the well and barrier layers under the proposed conditions. Then the properties of nonpolar AlGaN QWs were investigated. Nonpolar AlGaN had several superior characteristics compared to <b>c-plane</b> QWs, including large overlap integrals, optical polarization suitable for both edge and surface emissions, an almost linearly polarized optical dipole between the conduction band and top VB due to the isolated VBs, and a reduced VB density of state.

It has clearly been shown that the AFM-LO rate on c-plane 4 H-SiC is significantly higher than the other plane orientations, which can be correlated to the areal density of the first layer for the different surfaces as well as the doping concentration.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} whether standardization of the multiplanar view (SMV) when evaluating the uterus using three-dimensional ultrasonography (3 D-US) improves intra-and interobserver reliability and agreement {{with regard to}} endometrial measurement. Methods Two-dimensional (2 D) and 3 D-US {{was used to measure}} endometrial thickness by two observers in 30 women undergoing assisted reproduction treatment. Endometrial volume was measured with Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis (VOCAL (TM)) in the longitudinal (A) and coronal (C) planes using an unmodified multiplanar view (UMV) and a standardized multiplanar view (SMV). Measurement reliability was evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and agreement was examined using Bland-Altman plots with limits of agreement (LoA). The ease of outlining the endometrial-myometrial interface was compared between the A-and <b>C-planes</b> using subjective assessment. Results Endometrial volume measurements using the SMV and A-plane were more reliable (intra-and interobserver ICCs, 0. 979 and 0. 975, respectively) than were measurements of endometrial thickness using 2 D-US (intra-and interobserver ICCs, 0. 742 and 0. 702, respectively) or 3 D-US (intra-and interobserver ICCs, 0. 890 and 0. 784, respectively). The LoAs were narrower for SMV than for UMV. Reliability and agreement were not much different between the A- and <b>C-planes.</b> However the observers agreed that delineating the endometrial-myometrial interface using the A-plane was easier (first and second observer, 50. 0 and 46. 7 %, respectively) or `comparable` (50 and 53. 3 %, respectively), but never more difficult than using the C-plane.

30|$|To {{facilitate}} {{the mobility of}} heterogeneous networks, control plane (<b>C-plane)</b> and user plane (U-plane) decoupled architecture is being considered by the fifth generation (5 G) wireless communication network, in which relatively crucial <b>C-plane</b> is expanded and kept at dependable lower frequency bands to guarantee transmission reliability and the corresponding U-plane is moved to available higher frequency bands to boost capacity. Moreover, we apply this architecture to future professional high-speed railway wireless communication system to fulfill the wireless access desire of train passengers. However, for such emerging architecture, there still exist many problems to be solved to guarantee the reliable transmission. In this article, {{the problem of how}} to appropriately evaluate the transmission reliability of C/U-plane decoupled architecture is investigated. Due to the lack of ability to reflect the importance of <b>C-plane,</b> conventional outage probability cannot properly indicate the transmission reliability of C/U-plane decoupled architecture whose primary design consideration is that <b>C-plane</b> more heavily affects the transmission reliability thereby being kept at dependable lower frequency bands. Based on this, a novel indicator named unreliability factor (URF) is proposed.

Hence, it is more appropriate to employ URF as the indicator to evaluate the transmission reliability of C/U-plane decoupled architecture.|$|R

The implantation defects cause {{an expansion of}} the lattice normal to the surface, i. e. along the a-direction in a-plane and along the c-direction in <b>c-plane</b> GaN. The defect profile is bimodal with a pronounced surface damage peak and a second damage peak deeper in the bulk of the samples in both cases. For both surface orientations, the bulk damage saturates for high fluences. Interestingly, the saturation level for a-plane GaN is nearly three times lower than that for <b>c-plane</b> material suggesting very efficient dynamic annealing and strong resistance to radiation. a-plane GaN also shows superior damage recovery during post-implant annealing compared to <b>c-plane</b> GaN.

40|$|A {{useful tool}} to {{document}} structural inversion inside a shear zone is {{the identification of}} overprinted structures, which can increase {{the complexity of the}} internal fabric of shear zones. In the case of thrust faults, shear zones can also be problematic due to the occurrence of structures connected to flexural slip along bedding in the recumbent forelimb. Therefore identification of superimposition among different structures can help to distinguish among these configurations inside a shear zone. In Central Apennines (Italy), favourable conditions along the outcrop of Mt. Tancia’s thrust allowed the discovery of two sets of superimposed fabric elements referring to two opposite senses of shear. The first is related to thrusting (top-to-E–NE), whereas the second is likely associated to reactivation in normal sense (top-to-W–SW). The fabric elements have been mapped and their distribution inside a semi-brittle shear zone has been defined. High angle extensional shear planes occurring only in the uppermost part of the shear zone (closest to the main thrust plane) have been interpreted as a new generation of <b>C-planes,</b> connected to negative reactivation, instead of Riedel shear planes. The overprinting relationship defined inside the shear zone helps in discriminating whether the observed structures developed in the footwall of the main thrust or on the recumbent limb of the hanging wall’s anticline. The deformation inside the shear zone can be described using a simple shear model at the outcrop scale, where reoccurrence of fibrous calcite on shear <b>C-planes</b> should control rotation of S-planes; these are dissolution planes parallel to the XY-plane of the local strain ellipsoid. At thin section scale, instead, veins maintaining the same orientation suggest a coaxial deformation due to repeated crystallization events controlled by fluid pressure and differential stress variation...|$|E

We have synthesized the metal±organic precursors used in this study. Strongly [111] oriented polycrystalline MgO ®lms were obtained on both Si(100) and <b>c-plane</b> sapphire substrates using these precursors in the temperature range 500 ± 6008 C. The MgO thin ®lms grown on Si(100) at 6008 C and on <b>c-plane</b> sapphire at 5008 C with Mg(tmhd) 2 are highly oriented in the [111] direction, whereas the MgO ®lm grown on Si(100) at 3508 C and then annealed at 5208 C has no preferred orientation. In the case of using Mg(acac) 2 as precursor, however, the MgO ®lm deposited on <b>c-plane</b> sapphire surface at a deposition temperature above 5008 C was grown with more [110] and [100] dominant orientation relatively rather than [111]. Furthermore, we have also shown that the synthesized precursors Mg(tmhd) 2 and Mg(acac) 2 are suitable precursors for obtaining MgO thin ®lms by MOCVD and the substrate or precursor type and the growth temperature will be important factors in¯uencing either the crysta...|$|R
