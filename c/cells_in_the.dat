5|$|Heart tissue, {{like all}} <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body, {{needs to be}} {{supplied}} with oxygen, nutrients {{and a way of}} removing metabolic wastes. This is achieved by the coronary circulation, which includes arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. Blood flow through the coronary vessels occurs in peaks and troughs relating to the heart muscle's relaxation or contraction.|$|E

Like the institutes before it, all data generated and tools developed will be made publicly available online.|$|E
5|$|In blood plasma, zinc {{is bound}} to and transported by albumin (60%, low-affinity) and {{transferrin}} (10%). Because transferrin also transports iron, excessive iron reduces zinc absorption, and vice versa. A similar antagonism exists with copper. The concentration of zinc in blood plasma stays relatively constant regardless of zinc intake. <b>Cells</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> salivary gland, prostate, immune system, and intestine use zinc signaling to communicate with other cells.|$|E

5|$|Like {{those of}} cnidarians, (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.), ctenophores' bodies {{consist of a}} {{relatively}} thick, jelly-like mesoglea sandwiched between two epithelia, layers of cells bound by inter-cell connections and by a fibrous basement membrane that they secrete. The epithelia of ctenophores have two layers of cells rather than one, {{and some of the}} <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper layer have several cilia per cell.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in the TREM2 gene {{have been}} {{associated}} with a 3 to 5 times higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. A suggested mechanism of action is that when TREM2 is mutated, white blood <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain are no longer able to control the amount of beta amyloid present.|$|E
50|$|The spinocervical pathway is a four-neuron, fast-conducting, tactile/pressure pathway {{from the}} spinal cord to sensory cortex.

5|$|Once {{the food}} is in the {{digestive}} cavity, gland <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastroderm release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach {{all parts of the}} digestive cavity. Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by diffusion or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick mesogleas, are transported by mobile <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mesoglea.|$|E
5|$|RNAi {{is under}} {{development}} as an insecticide, employing multiple approaches, including genetic engineering and topical application. <b>Cells</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midgut of some insects {{take up the}} dsRNA molecules in the process referred to as environmental RNAi. In some insects the effect is systemic as the signal spreads throughout the insect's body (referred to as systemic RNAi).|$|E
5|$|Some self {{reactive}} T cells {{escape the}} thymus {{for a number}} of reasons, mainly {{due to the lack of}} expression of some self antigens in the thymus. Another type of T cell T regulatory cells can down regulate self reactive T <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periphery. When immunological tolerance fails, autoimmune diseases can follow.|$|E

5|$|The {{brains of}} all species are {{composed}} primarily of two broad classes of cells: neurons and glial cells. Glial cells (also known as glia or neuroglia) come in several types, and perform {{a number of}} critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development. Neurons, however, are usually considered the most important <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain.|$|E

5|$|Amanita rubrovolvata {{produces}} a white to cream-colored spore print. The spores are spherical or nearly so, and typically measure 7.5–9.0 by 7.0–8.5µm. They are inamyloid, {{meaning that they}} will not absorb iodine stain from Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hymenium) are club-shaped, four-spored (rarely two-spored), and measure 25–44 by 10–14µm. The sterigmata (slender extensions at the basidial tips that attach to the spores) are 3–4µm long, and clamps are not found on the bases of basidia.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{exist in}} {{a broad range of}} habitats, and as a major part of global ecosystems, may {{represent}} about 20% of microbial <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oceans. The first-discovered archaeans were extremophiles. Indeed, some archaea survive high temperatures, often above , as found in geysers, black smokers, and oil wells. Other common habitats include very cold habitats and highly saline, acidic, or alkaline water. However, archaea include mesophiles that grow in mild conditions, in swamps and marshland, sewage, the oceans, the intestinal tract of animals, and soils.|$|E
5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA {{in the first}} step of catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E
