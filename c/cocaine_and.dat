5|$|While {{prohibited}} drugs are generally {{viewed as being}} the most dangerous, the misuse of prescription drugs are linked to more deaths in several countries. <b>Cocaine</b> <b>and</b> heroin combined caused fewer deaths than prescriptions drugs in the United Kingdom in 2013, and fewer deaths than prescription opiates alone in the United States in 2008. As of 2015 the drug most likely to cause fatal overdose in Australia was diazepam (Valium). While fatal overdoses are highly associated with drugs such as opiates, <b>cocaine</b> <b>and</b> alcohol, deaths from other drugs such as caffeine are extremely rare.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{polydrug use}} {{patterns}} in heroin <b>and</b> <b>cocaine</b> addicts. We use data on two experiments {{to measure the}} elasticity of several addictive drugs with respect to heroin <b>and</b> <b>cocaine</b> prices. Own <b>and</b> cross price elasticities are estimated while controlling for non-price related sources of variance. The results indicate that heroin addicts have an inelastic demand for heroin, complement heroin consumption with <b>cocaine,</b> marijuana, <b>and</b> alcohol and substitute Valium and cigarettes. Additionally, heroin addicts’ cocaine consumption is inelastic, <b>and</b> they substitute <b>cocaine</b> with marijuana <b>and</b> Valium, and complement it with alcohol. Cocaine addicts have an elastic demand for cocaine; they complement <b>cocaine</b> with heroin <b>and</b> alcohol and substitute it with marijuana <b>and</b> Valium. <b>Cocaine</b> addicts’ demand for heroin is inelastic; and, for this group, alcohol is a complement to heroin while <b>cocaine,</b> marijuana <b>and</b> Valium are substitutes to heroin...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this chapter is to {{summarize}} the information currently available on <b>cocaine</b> production <b>and</b> trafficking. The chapter starts by describing the available data on <b>cocaine</b> production <b>and</b> trade, the collection methodologies, (if available) used by different sources, the main biases in the data, and the accuracy of different data sources. Next, the chapter states {{some of the key}} empirical questions <b>and</b> hypotheses regarding <b>cocaine</b> production <b>and</b> trade and takes a first look at how well the data matches these hypotheses. Also, the chapter states some of the main puzzles in the <b>cocaine</b> market <b>and</b> studies some of the possible explanations. These puzzles and empirical questions should guide future research into our understanding of the key determinants of illicit drug production and trafficking. Finally, the chapter studies the different policies that producer countries have adopted to fight against <b>cocaine</b> production <b>and</b> the role consumer countries play in the implementation of anti-drug policies.

Downey was under the influence of a controlled substance and in possession of <b>cocaine</b> <b>and</b> Valium.

5|$|Between {{the summer}} of 2009 and March 2010, the use of {{mephedrone}} grew rapidly in the UK, with it becoming readily available at music festivals, head shops and on the internet. A survey of Mixmag readers in 2009, found {{it was the fourth}} most popular street drug in the United Kingdom, behind cannabis, <b>cocaine,</b> <b>and</b> ecstasy. The drug was used by a diverse range of social groups. Whilst the evidence was anecdotal, researchers, charity workers, teachers and users reported widespread and increasing use of the drug in 2009. The drug's rapid growth in popularity was believed to be related to both its availability and legality.|$|E

5|$|Cocaine, {{substituted}} amphetamines (including methamphetamine), Adderall, methylphenidate (marketed as Ritalin or Concerta), MDMA (ecstasy) {{and other}} psychostimulants exert their effects primarily or partly by increasing dopamine {{levels in the}} brain {{by a variety of}} mechanisms. <b>Cocaine</b> <b>and</b> methylphenidate are dopamine transporter blockers or reuptake inhibitors; they non-competitively inhibit dopamine reuptake, resulting in increased dopamine concentrations in the synaptic cleft. Like cocaine, substituted amphetamines and amphetamine also increase the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, but by different mechanisms.|$|E

5|$|Croitoru {{was also}} known for his history of legal problems. He {{was a member of}} Satan's Choice, a biker gang. He was convicted of assault, {{trafficking}} <b>cocaine</b> <b>and</b> bombing a police station. In 2005, Croitoru was arrested for the murder of lawyer Lynn Gilbank and her husband Fred. After a lengthy investigation, the charges were dropped in June 2006 because of insufficient evidence. He worked as a security guard in Vancouver, British Columbia, until being arrested in May 2009 for conspiracy to commit murder. On January 24, 2011, Croitoru was charged with first degree murder in connection with the 2008 killing of Jonathan Barber in Burnaby, British Columbia.|$|E

5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. <b>Cocaine</b> <b>and</b> various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also {{increased significantly}} following {{the invention of the}} hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous drug users.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{examining}} the question: What factors play a decisive {{roll in the}} existence of the Colombian <b>cocaine</b> trade, <b>and</b> more importantly, {{what is the relationship between}} Colombian <b>cocaine</b> production <b>and</b> the nation’s systemic violence? Undemocratic political centralization and weak state capacity led to the creation of a legitimacy gap, which has been attributed to the emergence of the <b>cocaine</b> industry <b>and</b> Colombia’s civil violence. However, the relationship between <b>cocaine</b> production <b>and</b> that violence has been unclear. I propose that this relationship is economic in nature. The illegal nature of the good means that cocaine markets must be regulated by privatized enforcement mechanisms. In Colombia, non-state armed groups are charged with regulating the illegal drug industry. They provide a ‘specialized coercive labor,’ which is vital to cocaine production. This coercive labor acts as a mean of coercion, which is an input into the production of cocaine. Colombia, defined by an oligopoly of coercion, has an excess supply of specialized coercive labor, which is the country’s comparative advantage in the production of cocaine. The data analysis looks at time series comparisons of three different relationships: government legitimacy <b>and</b> <b>cocaine</b> production, oligopolies of coercion <b>and</b> <b>cocaine</b> production, <b>and</b> drug market stability and drug related violence. The results suggest that delegitimation of the Colombian state is the initial root cause of the emergence of the cocaine industry. Furthermore, they imply that violence, as a mean of coercion, is an input into the production of cocaine...|$|R

5|$|Many {{currently}} available pharmaceuticals {{are derived from}} the secondary metabolites plants use {{to protect themselves from}} herbivores, including opium, aspirin, <b>cocaine,</b> <b>and</b> atropine. These chemicals have evolved to affect the biochemistry of insects in very specific ways. However, many of these biochemical pathways are conserved in vertebrates, including humans, and the chemicals act on human biochemistry in ways similar to that of insects. It has therefore been suggested that the study of plant-insect interactions may help in bioprospecting.|$|E
