40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the radiopacity of calcium aluminate <b>cement</b> (Endo <b>Binder)</b> <b>with</b> 3 different radiopacifiers (bismuth oxide, zinc oxide, or zirconium oxide) in comparison with gray mineral trioxide aggregate (GMTA), white MTA, and dental structures (enamel and dentin). Methods: Eighteen test specimens of each <b>cement</b> <b>with</b> thicknesses of 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5, and 3. 0 mm (n = 3) were made by using a stainless steel matrix and were adapted to a standardizing device (8 x 7 cm) with a graduated aluminum stepwedge varying from 2. 0 - 16. 0 mm in thickness. To compare the radiopacity of the <b>cements</b> <b>with</b> that of dental structures, slices of first molars with a thickness increasing from 0. 5 - 3. 0 mm were obtained and placed on the standardizing device. One occlusal radiograph for each tested <b>cement</b> was taken, <b>with</b> exposure time of 0. 1 seconds and focus-film distance of 20 cm. Films were processed in an automatic device, and the mean radiopacity values were obtained by using a photodensitometer. Results: Mean values showed that the thicker the specimen was, the greater was its radiopacity. Only EndoBinder + bismuth oxide (EBBO) and GMTA demonstrated radiopacity values greater than 3. 0 mm of the aluminum scale for all thicknesses. When zinc oxide was used as radiopacifier agent, EndoBinder only reached the desired radiopacity with a thickness of 2. 0 mm, and with zirconium oxide it was 2. 5 mm. Conclusions: Bismuth oxide was the most efficient radiopacifier for EndoBinder, providing adequate radiopacity in all studied thicknesses, as recommended by ISO 6876, being similar to GMTA.

Nanoparticles react with the basic chemical elements that compose the concrete and act as crystallization centres. Therefore, the concrete porosity is reduced, while physical and technology-related properties of the ornamental fine concrete are improved. The authors have proven that the application of the nano-dispersed additive that contains titanium dioxide influences the processes of the structure formation in respect of fine ornamental concretes and improves the strength, as well as the water and cold resistance of fine concretes. The improvement is attributed to the dense concrete structure and strong adhesion between cement grains and between the cement and the aggregate. This conclusion is based on the data obtained through the employment of an electronic microscope used to identify the porosity of fine concretes.

With an increased global focus on environmental concerns such as global warming, sustainable development and recycling; alternatives to conventional concrete are being researched, such as geopolymer concrete. Geopolymer concrete replaces <b>cement</b> based <b>binder</b> <b>with</b> an alternative <b>binder</b> which contains no Portland cement. One type of geopolymer binder is that which contains fly-ash activated by an alkaline solution of sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide. Utilising recycled concrete waste from construction and demolition sites, that would otherwise be disposed of into landfill, as a source of aggregate offers a potential environmental and economic benefit. The term recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is used to define aggregate produced from crushed demolition and construction waste. Used together, geopolymer concrete and recycled concrete aggregate eliminate the need for Portland cement and makes use of waste materials. Significant research has been conducted into both recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) ordinary Portland cement concrete and geopolymer concrete; however there was limited published data on using RCA in geopolymer at the time of this research. Thus the aim was to investigate the mechanical properties of geopolymer concrete with recycled concrete aggregate as partial replacement of the natural coarse aggregate.

The influences of sintering process parameters, such as holdingtime, temperature and counter pressure on the formation of the gradient zone wereinvestigated.

40|$|There {{is a major}} {{interest}} in replacing cobalt binder in hardmetals (cemented carbides) aiming for materials with similar or even improved properties at a lower price. Nickel {{is one of the}} materials most commonly used as a binder alternative to cobalt in these metal-ceramic composites. However, knowledge on mechanical properties and particularly on fatigue behavior of Ni-base cemented carbides is relatively scarce. In this study, the fatigue mechanics and mechanisms of a fine grained WC-Ni grade is assessed. In doing so, fatigue crack growth (FCG) behavior and fatigue limit are determined, and the attained results are compared to corresponding fracture toughness and flexural strength. An analysis of the results within a fatigue mechanics framework permits to validate FCG threshold as the effective fracture toughness under cyclic loading. Experimentally determined data are then used to analyze the fatigue susceptibility of the studied material. It is found that the fatigue sensitivity of the WC-Ni hardmetal investigated is close to that previously reported for Co-base <b>cemented</b> carbides <b>with</b> alike <b>binder</b> mean free path. Additionally, fracture modes under stable and unstable crack growth conditions are inspected. It is evidenced that stable crack growth under cyclic loading within the nickel binder exhibit faceted, crystallographic features. This microscopic failure mode is rationalized {{on the basis of the}} comparable sizes of the cyclic plastic zone ahead of the crack tip and the characteristic microstructure length scale where fatigue degradation phenomena take place in hardmetals, i. e. the binder mean free path.

The in-situ response of WC-Ni and WC-Co composites under compressive loading was measured using neutron diffraction techniques. These measurements give a clear indication of the elastic strain behavior of both the carbide and metal binder phases in directions both axial and transverse to the applied load. Residual stress measurements were also made on as-produced samples and on those samples which had been mechanically loaded. These measurements show a substantial relaxation in the initial thermal residual stresses of the <b>cemented</b> carbides <b>with</b> high <b>binder</b> content, most of which occurs {{by the end of the}} first load-unload cycle. This relaxation in residual stress is also found to be anisotropic, relaxing more in the direction transverse to the loading axis than in the direction parallel to the loading axis. Strain distribution was considered by observing the change in peak widths in the diffraction data. Taken as a whole, the data suggests a profound role for thermal residual stress and the point-to-point variation of residual stress in the response of cemented carbides to applied load.
