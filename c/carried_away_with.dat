5|$|Bradford {{had just}} 13 players when McCall took over, {{and he made}} a number of summer signings {{including}} defender Darren Williams, midfielders Kyle Nix, Alex Rhodes and Scott Phelan, and strikers Barry Conlon, Guylain Ndumbu-Nsungu and Peter Thorne. McCall recorded his first win as a manager against Wrexham on 25 August 2007 after substitute Luke Medley scored a late winner, but despite his pre-season target his team spent much {{of the first half of}} the season in the bottom half of the table. After going unbeaten in January, the club were still 15th in League Two, and McCall told the Telegraph & Argus he did not regret his pre-season target but was <b>carried</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the euphoria at the time. City's form continued to improve during the second half of the season, and McCall led his side to 10th place in League Two.|$|E

25|$|The {{passenger}} train was the 16:45 from Cleethorpes to Manchester {{consisting of a}} brake van, three passenger carriages and a rear guard's van. The goods train which had left Grimsby {{earlier in the day}} for Doncaster consisted of 44 waggons loaded with larch tree trunks, three trunks to a load secured with chains. The length of the trunks (up to 42ft) necessitated the close coupling of the waggons. The goods train was being shunted on a curve at low speed adjacent to the main line when 5 trucks derailed just as the {{passenger train}} approached. One truck toppled over; its load of timber projecting over the main line. The brake van 'was <b>carried</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the exception of the offside and roof'. The next two carriages were 'clean swept away' above the floor level; the first compartment of the third passenger carriage was also destroyed.|$|E

500|$|The elder Southard's {{life was}} often busy and sleepless. According to L. Vernon Briggs, a {{colleague}} at Boston Psychopathic Hospital, Southard considered himself hypomanic. [...] "He himself said {{that most people}} fell within one of the classifications of mental disease, and he felt himself {{to be of the}} manic-depressive type. We seldom saw the depressive side of him though it was undoubtedly there; ordinarily he appeared <b>carried</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> enthusiasm about his latest interest– and everything worthwhile interested him", Briggs wrote.|$|E

During stings, to the bewilderment of the police, Yates waits until he is done engaging in actual sex acts with his male patrons before making an arrest. After he engages in group sex with numerous members of the fraternity house Alpha Tau Omega and doing business for Keyshawn, Yates' fellow officers begin to openly suggest to Yates that he is getting too <b>carried</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> his duties, as Yates now also has a pimp, Keyshawn.|$|E

[...] Around the same time, Dylan enthused to journalist Jules Siegel, [...] "Just listen to that! That's old-time religious carnival music!" [...] However, in 1969, Dylan confessed to Rolling Stones editor, Jann Wenner, [...] "I just sat down at a table and started writing...

500|$|IGN's Matt Risley {{rated the}} episode an 8 out of 10, calling it more [...] "classically, indulgently, infectiously Christmassy" [...] than the {{previous}} Christmas specials. He praised the production design and special effects teams for [...] "creating some dazzlingly memorable special effects, and a winter wonderland that was both recognisably, fuzzily Christmas incarnate and unerringly, tensely alien" [...] but thought the supporting cast [...] "triumphed above and beyond" [...] the plot devices. Like Hogan, Risley commented that the comedian cast of Bailey and Weir as well as Armstrong [...] "felt lacking". However, the next year, Risley wrote that he [...] "got a little <b>carried</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the festive funtimes ... On reflection, the overwhelming Christmassyness of it all was overcompensating for a pretty flimsy, frivolous plot." [...] Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the special {{four out of five}} stars, praising Smith's acting and Blackburn's Doctor Who directing debut as well as the special effects. However, he thought that the lack of a villain was an [...] "interesting experiment, but maybe not ideal for Christmas Day" [...] and Bailey and Weir's forest rangers [...] "felt like bolt-on comic relief".|$|E
500|$|Opposed to Another Green Worlds music, which Eno {{described}} as [...] "sky music", Eno {{referred to the}} music of Before and After Science as [...] "ocean music". References to water in the lyrics appear in songs such as [...] "Backwater", [...] "Julie With..." [...] and [...] "By this River". Author Simon Reynolds noted themes of [...] "boredom" [...] and [...] "bliss" [...] through the album, citing [...] "Here He Comes", about [...] "a boy trying to vanish by floating through the sky through a different time" [...] and [...] "Spider and I", about a boy watching the sky and dreaming about being <b>carried</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> a ship, as examples. Eno's songwriting style was {{described as}} [...] "a sound-over-sense approach". Influenced by poet Kurt Schwitters, Eno consciously did not make songwriting or lyrics the main focus in the music. Tom Carson of Rolling Stone noted this style, stating that the lyrics are [...] "only complementary variables" [...] to the music on the album. Lester Bangs commented on Eno's lyrical style on [...] "Julie with..." [...] stating that the lyrics themes [...] "could be a murderer's ruminations, or simply a lovers' retreat... or Julie could be three years old". Schwitters' influence is also shown on the song [...] "Kurt's Rejoinder", on which samples of Schwitters' poem [...] "Ursonate" [...] can be heard.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 29 May the theatre was packed. Gustav Linor reported, [...] "Never... has the hall been so full, or so resplendent; the {{stairways}} and the corridors were crowded with spectators eager to see and to hear". The evening began with Les Sylphides, in which Nijinsky and Karsavina danced the main roles. The Rite followed. Some eyewitnesses and commentators said that the disturbances in the audience began during the Introduction, and grew in a crescendo when the curtain rose on the stamping dancers in [...] "Augurs of Spring". But music historian Richard Taruskin asserts, [...] "it was not Stravinsky's music that did the shocking. It was the ugly earthbound lurching and stomping devised by Vaslav Nijinsky." [...] Marie Rambert, who was working {{as an assistant to}} Nijinsky, recalled later that it was soon impossible to hear the music on the stage. In his autobiography, Stravinsky writes that the derisive laughter that greeted the first bars of the Introduction disgusted him, and that he left the auditorium to watch the rest of the performance from the stage wings. The demonstrations, he says, grew into [...] "a terrific uproar" [...] which, along with the on-stage noises, drowned out the voice of Nijinsky who was shouting the step numbers to the dancers. The journalist and photographer Carl Van Vechten recorded that the person behind him got <b>carried</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> excitement, and [...] "began to beat rhythmically on top of my head", though Van Vechten failed to notice this at first, his own emotion being so great.|$|E

500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide praised [...] "David Schwimmer for {{throwing}} himself into this role" [...] as Jared, [...] "this rather unlikable lout." [...] Webb Mitovich also wrote that [...] " [...] party {{in and of}} itself has to be one of 30 Rocks finest and most manic moments." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad thought that [...] " [...] Schwimmer was good as Greenzo" [...] and that [...] "the subplots were some of the most bizarre this season." [...] Robert Canning of IGN thought that the [...] "cameo from Al Gore {{at the end of the}} show added little to the episode. It was a fine bit, but it wasn't helped by the fact that nearly the entire scene had already aired in the promos leading up to the episode" [...] and that [...] "seeing [...] desperately take on the role of Greenzo and then get <b>carried</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the whole concept could have been hysterically self-referential [...] Instead we got Jerrod as Greenzo and the whole thing just felt flat and forced." [...] Canning rated the episode [...] "8 out of 10" [...] Pittsburgh Post-Gazettes Rob Owen also felt that Al Gore's appearance had been [...] "already given away in [...] promos". He praised the episode's dialogue, saying that Baldwin's line, [...] "you could put on a silly hat and tell the kids how outsourcing means cheaper toys for Christmas" [...] was the sort of dialogue that [...] "makes 30 Rock rock. Hard." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that this episode [...] "was one of the best of season 2" [...] and that [...] "Schwimmer's performance reminded [...] of his most bizarre episodes as Friends Ross Geller, like 'The One With Ross's Sandwich'." [...] The episode of Friends referred to includes Schwimmer's character, Ross, shouting at his boss for eating his special Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.|$|E

Weißheimer writes about this memorable night that [...] "Wagner <b>carried</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the audience and caused them to rally tumultuously.

2500|$|In May 2014, the Obama {{administration}} appointed William Evanina, {{a former}} FBI special agent with a counter-terrorism specialty, {{as the new}} government-wide National Counterintelligence Executive. [...] "Instead of getting <b>carried</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the concept of leakers as heroes," [...] Evanina said in August, [...] "we {{need to get back}} to the basics of what it means to be loyal. Undifferentiated, unauthorized leaking is a criminal act." [...] While dealing with insider threats had been an intelligence community priority since WikiLeaks published Chelsea Manning's disclosures in 2010, Evanina said that in the aftermath of Snowden's June 2013 revelations, the process [...] "sped up from a regional railway to the Acela train." [...] A year later, 100,000 fewer people had security clearances.|$|E

2500|$|Fisher {{was five}} feet seven {{inches tall and}} stocky with a round face. In later years, some insinuated that Fisher, born in Ceylon of British parents, had Asian ancestry due to his {{features}} and the yellow cast of his skin. His colour resulted from dysentery and malaria in middle life, which nearly caused his death. He had a fixed and compelling gaze when addressing someone, which gave little clue to his feelings. Fisher was energetic, ambitious, enthusiastic and clever. A shipmate described him as [...] "easily the most interesting midshipman I ever met". When addressing someone he could become <b>carried</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the point he was seeking to make, and on one occasion, the King asked him to stop shaking his fist in his face.|$|E
2500|$|Geomagnetic {{disturbance}} from {{an enhanced}} solar wind causes distortions of the magnetotail ("magnetic substorms"). These 'substorms' tend to occur after prolonged spells (hours) {{during which the}} interplanetary magnetic field has had an appreciable southward component. This leads to {{a higher rate of}} interconnection between its field lines and those of Earth. As a result, the solar wind moves magnetic flux (tubes of magnetic field lines, 'locked' together with their resident plasma) from the day side of Earth to the magnetotail, widening the obstacle it presents to the solar wind flow and constricting the tail on the night-side. Ultimately some tail plasma can separate ("magnetic reconnection"); some blobs ("plasmoids") are squeezed downstream and are <b>carried</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the solar wind; others are squeezed toward Earth where their motion feeds strong outbursts of auroras, mainly around midnight ("unloading process"). A geomagnetic storm resulting from greater interaction adds many more particles to the plasma trapped around Earth, also producing enhancement of the [...] "ring current". Occasionally the resulting modification of the Earth's magnetic field can be so strong that it produces auroras visible at middle latitudes, on field lines much closer to the equator than those of the auroral zone.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, Gainsbourg and English actress Jane Birkin began a {{relationship}} {{when they met}} {{on the set of}} the film Slogan. After filming, he asked her to record the song with him. Birkin had heard the Bardot version and thought it [...] "so hot". She said: [...] "I only sang it because I didn't want anybody else to sing it", jealous at the thought of his sharing a recording studio with someone else. Gainsbourg asked her to sing an octave higher than Bardot, [...] "so you'll sound like a little boy". It was recorded in an arrangement by Arthur Greenslade in a studio at Marble Arch. Birkin said she [...] "got a bit <b>carried</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the heavy breathing – so much so, in fact, that I was told to calm down, which meant that at one point I stopped breathing altogether. If you listen to the record now, you can still hear that little gap." [...] There was media speculation, as with the Bardot version, that they had recorded live sex, to which Gainsbourg told Birkin, [...] "Thank goodness it wasn't, otherwise I hope {{it would have been a}} long-playing record." [...] It was released in February 1969. The single had a plain cover, with the words [...] "Interdit aux moins de 21 ans" [...] (forbidden to those under 21), and the record company changed the label from Philips to Fontana.|$|E

2500|$|Oops!... I Did It Again {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of hundred to reviews from mainstream critics, Oops!... I Did It Again received an average score of seventy-two, based on twelve reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Giving the album {{four out of}} five stars, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted that the album [...] "has the same combination of sweetly sentimental ballads and endearingly gaudy dance-pop that made 'One More Time'," [...] but remarked that, [...] "Fortunately, she and her production team not only have a stronger overall set of songs this time, but they also occasionally get <b>carried</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the same bewildering magpie aesthetic, [...] giv the album character apart from the well-crafted dance-pop and ballads that serve as its heart. In the end, it's what makes this an entertaining, satisfying listen." [...] Billboard magazine wrote that [...] "'Oops!...' indicates that she's developing a soulful edge and emotional depth that can't be conjured with a glass-shattering note," [...] praising the album for consistently cast Spears as a young woman coming to terms with her inner power—and that's a darn good message to offer an impressionable audience." [...] Entertainment Weeklys David Browne gave the album a B-rating, writing that the album [...] "reminds us once again that the best new pop can be a blast of cool air in a stifling room." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2006, Miller {{stated that}} he {{intended}} to make Fury Road and that the film was never going to involve Gibson: [...] "There's a real hope. The last thing I wanted to do is another Mad Max, but this script came along, and I'm completely <b>carried</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] The film's screenplay was co-written with cult British comic creator Brendan McCarthy, who also designed many of the new characters and vehicles. Miller again confirmed his intention to make another Mad Max at the 2007 Aurora filmmaker initiative. However, he {{stated that he}} thought Gibson would not be interested in the film because of his age. Heath Ledger was reportedly considered for the lead before his death in 2008. On 5 March 2009, it was announced that an R-rated 3D animated feature film was in pre-production and would be taking much of the plot from Fury Road, although Gibson would not be in the film and Miller was looking for a [...] "different route", a [...] "renaissance" [...] of the franchise. Miller cited director Akira Kurosawa as an inspiration for {{what he wanted to do}} with the franchise. Miller was also developing an action-adventure tie-in video game based on the fourth film, along with God of War II video game designer Cory Barlog. Both projects were expected to take two to two-and-a-half years, according to Miller, with a release date of either 2011 or 2012. Fury Road was going to be produced at Dr. D Studios, a digital art studios founded in 2008 by Miller and Doug Mitchell.|$|E
