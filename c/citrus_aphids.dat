Four citrus orchards (2 organic farming orchards, 2 conventional farming orchards) were sampled every 15 days during the two years. Aphid mummies were collected from young shoots. Citrus were attacked by five species of aphids, Aphis gossypii (Glover) Aphis spireacola (Pagenstecher), Toxoptera aurantii (Boyer), Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas). Five species of primary parasitoids were collected, Lysiphlebus testaceipes (Cresson), Lysiphlebus fabarum (Marshall), Binodoxys angelicae (Haliday), Aphidius matricariae (Haliday) and Aphidius colemani (Viereck). Six species of hyperparasites were also identified, Pachyneuron aphidis (Bouché), Pachyneuron muscarum (L.), Asaphes vulgaris (Walker), Asaphes suspensus (Nees), Phaenoglyphis villosa (Hartig) and Alloxysta victrix (Westwood). All the hyperparasites were identified to species {{for the first time}} in Tunisia. Lysiphlebus testaceipes was, by far, the dominant species of primary parasitoids in term of frequency in all the studied sites, while Pachyneuron aphidis was the dominant species of hyperparasite. The survey of parasitism rate in the first organic farming (site A) shows that it reached 14 and 17 % in 2010 and 2011 in the period of May-June.

40|$|Thesis (DSc (Zoology)) [...] PU for CHE, 1970. A {{comparatively}} new virus-like disease called greening {{has become}} a very serious threat in many citrus producing countries of the world. The disease is transmitted by two insect vectors belonging to the Psyllidae (Homoptera) namely, Trioza erytreae (Del Geurcio), the African vector, and Diaphorina citri Kuw., the Oriental vector. Field studies were made on the ecology, biology and control of T. erytreae in the northern Transvaal and in Swaziland during 1965 - 1970. This vector is extremely fecund but has weak powers of dispersal. The main ecological factors found to regulate populations of this insect were the flushing rhythm and flush quality of citrus, extremes of weather, and natural enemies. Other factors involved included interspecific competition with <b>citrus</b> <b>aphids,</b> and in some seasons intraspecific competition for breeding sites. Fundamentally flushing rhythm determines the potential population density of the vector, while the occurrence and sequence of lethal weather extremes mainly regulate the population size during citrus growth periods. A weather index was found to explain the pest status of the vector in southern Africa and partly accounts for previous outbreaks of vector and disease. A population model is given which explains the seasonal abundance of the insect. Studies were also made on the general biology including sex ratio, egg laying, mating behaviour, {{and the influence of}} temperature on the duration of the immature stages. The greening disease represents a severe limiting factor to citrus production in the high lying regions of the eastern Transvaal and Swaziland. The hotter lowveld areas are virtually free of disease symptoms and vector populations though present are usually low. Transmission studies showed that the T. erytreae is the principal vector, several other psyllid species feeding on citrus were not found to be transmitters. It appears that a fairly small proportion of field adults are infective {{and that there is a}} seasonal fluctuation in transmission efficiency. Single males and females were able to transmit the disease. Unsuccessful attempts were made to screen adults for infectivity using a chromatographic method, and to isolate the causal organism from excised salivary glands. The control of T. erytreae depends an the use of insecticides. Experiments to select a suitable material and to determine it’s correct time of application are described. A spray programme for the control of citrus psylla has been used with apparent success by farmers in the Malkerns district of Swaziland. Comparative field observations and surveys for both Asian greening disease and the Oriental vector are described, and the world distribution of greening and of the two psyllid vectors are given.

40|$|The writers review {{previous}} concepts {{concerning the}} reaction of citrus plants to the tristeza disease. It is recognized that environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and light can influence plant reaction, but these are considered of relatively minor importance. Characteristics of the plant itself govern its reaction to the disease and among those, resistance to infection, ability to permit virus increase and tolerance or non-tolerance of tissues are considered most important. Tests using viruliferous oriental <b>citrus</b> <b>aphids</b> for inoculation of various citrus types budded over sour orange rootstocks (table 1 and 2) showed a correlation between susceptibility to infection and severity of symptoms. The sweet oranges {{proved to be the}} most susceptible to infection and showed severe disease symptoms. The Barão sweet orange appeared to be more susceptible than Valencia. The mandarins tended to show some resistance to infection, but when infected, severe symptoms developed. The tolerant tangelos (7) behaved similarly to sweet oranges : They were very susceptible to infection and showed severe symptoms. The non-tolerant tangelos, susceptible citranges (7) and grapefruits behaved more or less alike, and showed medium susceptibility to infection and moderately severe disease symptoms. Among the grapefruits, Leonardy was. observed to be relatively more susceptible and showed more severe symptoms than Duncan. The pummelos, shaddocks and sour oranges were comparatively very resistant to infection and showed only moderate symptoms when infected. It has been found that the sour oranges can be more easily infected by tissue union than by the aphid vector. Poncirus trifoliata, citrumelos and resistant citranges showed no symptoms and no virus could be recovered from the inoculated plants even after three inoculations. The nature of injury caused by tristeza in the non-tolerant graft and intergraft combinations is discussed. The observation of symptoms shown by plants consisting of a sour orange inter-stem-graft between sweet orange roots and foliage seems to indicate that phloem collapse of the sour intergraft does not entirely prevent food translocation, since under field conditions the sweet stem below the sour intergraft continued, for almost two years, to increase in size at about the same rate as the sweet stem above. The growth of the sour intergraft was observed to be constricted and its lack of developments indicates a possible injurious effect of the disease on tissues other than the phloem. Root tissues of sour oranges {{have been found to be}} sensitive;to injury, sincejsweet orange tops grafted directly onto sour orange roots and subsequently inoculated showed the usual tristeza symptoms. Death of rootlets and roots was found to occur not only in infected plants with tolerant tops and non-tolerant rootstocks but also on infected tolerant plants having an inter-stem-graft of non-tolerant sour orange. These observations and those made of root reaction on mechanically ringed plants indicate that although the root tissues of non-tolerant stocks may be sensitive to injury the rootlet and root symptoms are mostly secondary reactions. Tests carried out showed that the tristeza virus was recovered from insect protected sprouts grown at the ends of severed roots of Caipira sweet orange stock thus indicating that the virus was definitely present in the roots of a tolerant rootstock. Previously tristeza has been recognized as being associated with various citrus stock-scion combinations. In the present paper 50 seedling types have been reported as showing tristeza symptoms following heavy aphid inoculation. The symptoms shown by infected seedlings are similar to those shown by non-tolerant stock-scion combinations. Small sweet orange seedlings have been observed to show some symptoms of tristeza following heavy inoculations, but citrus types possessing tolerant tissues have shown a tendency toward recovery from symptom expression. The writers, on the basis of observed plant responses, have discussed the mode of inheritance of the main characteristis involved in plant reaction to tristeza. Some seedling progenies of known crosses between Poncirus trifoliata and sweet oranges (citranges) have been found to permit virus increase as the sweet orange parent does, whereas others behave like P. trifoliata and apparently do not permit virus multiplication. No relationship has been found between the trifoliata leaf-shape and inability to permit virus increase, since some of the hybrids that possess the trifoliata leaves, permit virus multiplication. Backcrosses of citranges to sweet oranges show a tendency to behave like the sweet orange parent. Hybrids between P. trifoliata and grapefruits (citrumelos) have behaved in most cases as the parent P. trifoliata. This seems to indicate that tolerant tissues and inability to permit virus increase are dependent on dominant factors in this type of cross. Hybrids between Citrus reticulata and C. paradisi (tangelos) do not show a clear-cut type of inheritance. Some tangelos behave Uke the mandarin parent, possessing tolerant tissues; others behave like the grapefruit parent indicating possession of non-tolerant tissues. The inability to permit virus increase is a characteristic of little value in a rootstock improvement since tops of most commercial citrus varieties permit virus multiplication. It is pointed out that improvement of citrus rootstock with respect to tristeza should be aimed at combining tolerant tissues such as found in P. trifoliata or hybrids, C. sinensis, C. reticulata, etc., with other favorable characters such as vigor, resistance to gummosis, etc. Field tests showed that {{the reaction of}} infective buds on different rootstocks varies not only according to the tolerance of non-tolerance of the rootstock tissues, but also according to whether the buds themselves belong to types that possess non-tolerant or tolerant tissues. Infective buds of tolerant types, as sweet oranges, when budded on non-tolerant stocks produce a first flush of growth that is apparently healthy, but which later shows disease symptoms. For a period of about two months from date of budding, there is little or no difference between sprouts from healthy or infective buds of tolerant types. In contrast, when infective buds of non-tolerant types are budded on non-tolerant stocks, disease symptoms appear practically as soon as the buds start to grow. Observations indicate that infective buds from tolerant citrus types when budded on tolerant stocks usually do not develop symptoms even though the plant is a carrier of the virus. On the other hand observations indicate that infective buds of non-tolerant citrus types when budded on tolerant stocks may at times produce some symptoms. A possible explanation for the above-mentioned reactions is presented and is based on the relation between virus movement and food translocation in the plant. In the study of the relationship of tristeza virus to host tissues, plants composed of a sweet top over sour orange rootstock were allowed to develop two sweet orange branches. One branch of each plant was then ringed and inoculated by the vector. The branch not inoculated did not develop symptoms and 16 months after inoculation, buds were taken from the inoculated and the non-inoculated branches and tested for presence of virus. All buds taken from the inoculated ringed branches were found to be carrying the virus, whereas the buds taken from the other branch of the same plant did not have any virus. This experiment shows that the tristeza virus was not able to move across the ringed portion of the stem during that period, thus indicating that the tristeza virus is probably a phloem virus. Results from extensive buddings of various citrus stocks in the field indicate that buds taken from old sweet orange plants that have been known to be infected for a long time have been found to carry the virus in all buds. On the other hand, tests with buds taken from young plants recently infected, of Duncan grapefruit, sour orange and in some cases of Dancy tangerine and Valencia sweet orange, showed that not all buds were carrying the virus. It is not yet known whether buds that are mature prior to infection may temporarily escape virus invasion or whether citrus types which have non-tolerant tissues may limit to a certain extent complete systemic invasion of the tristeza virus...|$|E

To better understand the biology of the brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> and the emergence of genes expressed during wing development, researchers undertook a large-scale 5′ end sequencing project of cDNA clones from winged aphids. Similar large-scale expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing projects from other insects have provided a vehicle for answering biological questions relating to development and physiology. Although there is a growing database in GenBank of ESTs from insects, most are from Drosophila melanogaster, with relatively few specifically derived from aphids.The researchers were able to provide a large data set of ESTs from the alate (winged) brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> and have begun to analyze this valuable resource. They were able to do this with the help of information on Drosophila melanogaster in FlyBase. Putative sequence identity was determined using BLAST searches.

5000|$|Aphids are {{the main}} vector by which CTV is {{transmit}}ted. Initially the United States only had the melon (cotton aphid) Aphis gossypii, spirea aphid Aphis spiraecola, and black <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> Toxoptera aurantii. [...] These aphids transmit the virus much less efficiently than the brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> Toxoptera citricida. Toxoptera citricida {{had been found in}} East Asia and South America, and had slowly made its way up through Central America and the Caribbean Islands. By 1993 it had reached Cuba, and in 1995 it was found in Florida. [...] The aphids require at least 30 to 60 minutes of feeding to acquire the virus, and remain viruliferous for at least 24 hours after. T. citricida is much more efficient than the other aphids, and it can transmit CTV strains causing severe stem pitting or decline that the other aphids cannot vector. Even though A. spiraecola is less efficient, it tends to have higher populations and thus can still transfer the virus fairly well. T. aurantii has been shown to only transmit certain strains of CTV. Of the three lesser efficient aphids, A. gossypii has a 78% transmission efficiency, while A. spiraecola and T. aurantii are between 0-6%. [...] The main cultural practice that increases the severity of the CTV is when the citrus trees are grafted onto the sour orange rootstock. Using CTV infected budwood for grafting can transfer the CTV from the original tree to the new one.|$|R

The aphid Toxoptera citricida (Kyrkaldy) (Sternorrhyncha) is {{a potential}} vector of citrus virus tristeza, consider an important pest of the orchard. Was realized bimonthly monitoring between October 2002 and October 2003, with aim of study the populational dynamic this aphid, included predators ant ant-tending, in organic cropping of tangerine cv Ponkan, Fazendinha Agroecológica, Seropédica, RJ. The faunistic analysis of the ant-tending and predators, were realized across Shanon-Wiener (H') and Simpson (D) diversity index's, Berger-Parker dominance (d) and equitability J (e). The predators considered efficient in the populational reduction of brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> (BCA), was Cycloneda sanguinea (L.), Azya luteipes Mulsant and Pseudodorus clavatus (Fabr.), although has been registered eight predators attacking BCA colonies. Verified that C. sangiunea obtained the biggest populational peak, following P. clavatus and A. luteipes. The predators diversity and equitability was considered high (H'= 0. 7979; D = 0. 9638; e= 0. 8836). Tending BCA, was registered Brachymyrmex sp., Camponotus rufipes (Fabricius) Camponotus atriceps (Fabricius), Camponotus crassus (Mayr), Camponotus clypeatus (Mayr); Crematogaster sp., Solenospis sp., Ectatomma brunneum (Fabricius) and Pseudomyrmex termitarius (Fr. Smith). Ant-tending was considered medium to H' value (0. 6585) and high to D value (0. 9012). The equitability was considered medium too (e = 0. 69). T. citricida populational dynamic is influenced to foliar shoot following predation and ant-tending. These two end factors are antagonist due to protection offer to ants at BCA...|$|R
40|$|Citrus {{tristeza}} virus (CTV) {{occurs in}} most citrus producing {{regions of the}} world, {{and it is the}} most serious viral pathogen of citrus. With the recent establishment of the brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid,</b> Toxoptera citricida, its most efficient vector, on Madeira Island (Portugal) and in Florida (USA) and the countries of the Caribbean Basin, the impact of CTV is likely to increase in these regions. Since there are many strains of CTV and CTV infections frequently occur as mixtures of several strains, it is necessary to be able to distinguish the strains for regulatory purposes, disease management and epidemiology. We describe the evolution of techniques developed to detect CTV and to differentiate the individual strains, and present the results of tests using these latest methods on CTV isolates from mainland Portugal, Madeira Island and Florida. Mild and decline-inducing strains of CTV were detected in mainland Portugal and mild, decline-inducing and severe stem pitting strains on Madeira Island. In Florida we demonstrated the presence of infections that reacted with probes made against stem pitting strains not previously detected there. It is concluded that CTV presents a significant threat to citrus production in mainland Portugal, on Madeira Island and in the neighbouring countries of the Mediterranean Basin, as well as in Florida, elsewhere in the USA and throughout the Caribbean Basin, especially following the widespread establishment of T. citricida throughout the region.

40|$|The black <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid,</b> Toxoptera aurantii Boyer de Fonscolombe (Hemiptera: Aphididae), an {{important}} pest of citrus species, feeds by sucking sap from plant leaves. It causes some leaf distortion and malformation of growing leaves and shoot tips. In this study, {{the effects of}} the botanical insecticide, palizin on T. aurantii and its parasitoid, Aphidius colemani Viereck (Hymenoptera: Brachonidae) were compared with the chemical insecticide, imidacloprid. The compounds were evaluated at maximum recommended field concentrations: palizin 2, 000 ppm, imidacloprid 500 ppm, water (as control) on adult aphids. Spraying was done with a 100 -l engine Honda sprayer (GX 120 T 1, 160 T 1, 200 T) until run-off. The number of dead aphids was recorded 24, 48 and 72 hours after treatment. According to the results, statistically {{significant differences were found between}} treatments (p ≤ 0. 05). Twenty-four hours after treatment, imidacloprid was more effective than palizin in reducing the T. aurantii population. Palizin showed high efficiency (95 % mortality) 72 hours after treatment. However, at that time, there was no statistically significant difference between the mean mortality percentages of imidacloprid and palizin. This shows that botanical insecticide, palizin can effectively control T. aurantii. Also, palizin caused low mortality (10. 86 %) on A. colemani while imidacloprid was more toxic (31. 1 % mortality). The results of the present study indicated that palizin can be used instead of chemical insecticide, imidacloprid in control programs of T. aurantii...|$|R
40|$|The first detections of Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, in North America {{occurred}} almost {{simultaneously in}} Florida {{and in the}} Caribbean (Guadeloupe). Damaging populations on citrus {{have been reported in}} Florida but not in Puerto Rico where the psyllid was first detected in 2001, having probably arrived with its parasitoid, Tamarixia radiate Waterston. In an effort to identify additional sources of mortality, the relative abundance of coccinellid species was estimated on 180 citrus trees from early April to early July 2003. The most abundant species were Coelophora inaequalis F. (38. 8 %) and Cycloneda sanguinea limbifer L. (31. 3 %), and the least abundant were Cladis nitidula F. (5. 9 %), Coleomegilla innonata Mulsant (4. 8 %), Chilocorus cacti L. (2. 1 %), Scymnus sp. (5. 9 %), Hippodamia convergens Guerin (2. 4 %), and Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant (8. 8 %). These eight species were collected from citrus production areas in Puerto Rico for a laboratory study of feeding behavior. All eight consumed D. citri nymphs, with C. innonata consuming psyllids at a greater rate than C. cacti or Scymnus sp. Choice tests showed that C. inaequalis and C. s. limbifer preferred brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> (BCA) Toxoptera citricida to D. citri as prey, whereas C. nitidula and C. cacti (both Chilochorini) preferred D. citri. Our results suggest that coccinellid species could play an important role as predators of the psyllid in Puerto Rico and contribute to its natural control...|$|R
40|$|Stylet sheath {{formation}} {{is a common}} feature among phytophagous hemipterans. These sheaths are considered essential to promote a successful feeding event. Stylet sheath compositions are largely unknown and their mode of solidification remains to be elucidated. This report demonstrates the formation and solidification of in āere (in air) produced stylet sheaths by six hemipteran families: Diaphorina citri (Psyllidae, Asian citrus psyllid), Aphis nerii (Aphididae, oleander/milkweed aphid), Toxoptera citricida (Aphididae, brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid),</b> Aphis gossypii (Aphididae, cotton melon aphid), Bemisia tabaci biotype B (Aleyrodidae, whitefly), Homalodisca vitripennis (Cicadellidae, glassy-winged sharpshooter), Ferrisia virgata (Pseudococcidae, striped mealybug), and Protopulvinaria pyriformis (Coccidae, pyriform scale). Examination of in āere produced stylet sheaths by confocal and scanning electron microscopy shows a common morphology of an initial flange laid down {{on the surface of}} the membrane followed by continuous hollow core structures with sequentially stacked hardened bulbous droplets. Single and multi-branched sheaths were common, whereas mealybug and scale insects typically produced multi-branched sheaths. Micrographs of the in āere formed flanges indicate flange sealing upon stylet bundle extraction in D. citri and the aphids, while the B. tabaci whitefly and H. vitripennis glassy-winged sharpshooter flanges remain unsealed. Structural similarity of in āere sheaths are apparent in stylet sheaths formed in planta, in artificial diets, or in water. The use of 'Solvy', a dissolvable membrane, for intact stylet sheath isolation is reported. These observations illustrate for the first time this mode of stylet sheath synthesis adding to the understanding of stylet sheath formation in phytophagous hemipterans and providing tools for future use in structural and compositional analysis...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} serious {{diseases}} of citrus worldwide is caused by the viral pathogen Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) (family: Closteroviridae, genus: Closterovrius). This RNA virus is known to cause several economically important syndromes, namely quick decline, stem pitting and seedling yellows. The natural hosts for CTV include nearly all citrus species and cultivars, various citrus relatives such as Aeglopsis, Afraegle, Fortunella and Pamburus, and some intergeneric hybrids (Yokomi, 2009). The movement of CTV between different regions is mainly due to the dispersal of infected budwood (Bertolini et al., 2008). However, natural transmission and spread of CTV can also occur with the help of several aphid species of which the most effective vector is the Brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> (Kirkaldy) Toxoptera citricida (Tsai et al., 2009). The severity of a CTV infection may vary depending on various contributing factors, such as environmental conditions, the rootstock combination used and lastly the presence of the CTV genotype predominating within the mixed infection. Currently, there are eight known and published CTV genotypes, each with their own degree of virulence, and up to date, forty-seven CTV genomes have been fully sequenced. It has been observed in numerous CTV population diversity studies, that a host is normally infected with a mixture of genotypic strains (Read and Pietersen, 2015; Roy et al., 2010; Roy and Brlansky, 2004). This complicates biological indexing as well as diagnostic procedures in identifying homogenous genotypic sources. This pathogen is endemic to the citrus producing areas in South Africa; hence, a mild strain cross-protection scheme has been initiated during the year 1973; aiming to control the viral disease.

40|$|The use of {{tolerant}} rootstocks and preimmunization has satisfactorily controlled losses {{associated with}} the Citrus tristeza virus (CTV). Several researchers have shown that CTV mild isolates that are selected in the same region where they are used are superior to isolates obtained from other areas. Thus, budwoods of 20 outstanding citrus trees were collected in north and northwestern Paraná state (Brazil) citrus-producing areas and established {{to be used in}} a preimmunization program. These budwoods were tested to evaluate the potential protection of the inherently present viral complex. Based on biological indexing and molecular characterization of the capsid protein gene by RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism, which indicated that the plants were infected with mild isolates of CTV), some of the selected plants could be used in a preimmunization program. These potentially mild and protective isolates were challenged with severe 'Rolândia' isolate inoculations by grafting and by the brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> (Toxoptera citricida Kirkaldy) vector, which was faster in transmitting the virus. Some isolates had a better protective value than others, particularly when challenged with the severe CTV isolate. The SSCP (single strand conformational polymorphism) molecular analysis was an excellent complementary tool for monitoring the performance of the experiments and the stability of the viral complex present in the plants. Isolate number 1, collected in the municipality of Cruzeiro do Sul (CS- 1), was the most promising for protecting commercial Pêra sweet orange (C. sinensis L.) orchards in northern and northwestern Paraná. The Rolândia severe CTV isolate was stable and had a high genetic divergence among the severe isolates used as a control (Capão Bonito and Barão B) and all of the isolates tested...|$|R
40|$|Citrus {{tristeza}} virus (CTV), {{an economically}} important graft-transmissible pathogen of citrus, causes major global declines in citrus production. In the commercial citrus of the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas (LRGV), where red grapefruit on tristeza-decline sensitive sour orange rootstocks predominate, incidence of CTV is low. The efficient CTV vector, the brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> (BrCA, Toxoptera citricida Kirkaldy) is now established in Mexico and Florida, thus information is {{needed on the}} severity of CTV, CTV aphid transmission {{and the performance of}} transformed citrus towards CTV before T. citricida arrives in Texas so that appropriate management strategies can be selected. Biological indexing and molecular typing were performed on fifteen Texas CTV isolates. The majority of the CTV isolates tested contained the most severe CTV types known. In Florida, T. citricida were fed on crude CTV preparations in vitro and could transmit CTV to virus-free receptor plants with two CTV isolates, whereas a more highly purified CTV preparation from one CTV isolate was not transmitted by T. citricida. There were no differences in the majority of treatments in infectivity neutralizations using three CTV-derived antibodies (p 25, p 27 and p 20). CTV p 20 antibodies significantly enhanced the occurrence of CTV transmission in one test. The CTV genome of isolate H 33 was sequenced using 'shot gun' methods. The H 33 major component and H 33 minor components were phylogenetically compared to the six other full-length CTV sequences. An untranslatable CTV coat protein gene was genetically transformed into the genome of the Texas commercial Rio Red grapefruit variety, and fifty-two independent transgenic lines were produced. CTV challenge responses by the transgenic lines were variable. Individual plants could be identified which had low virus titers by ELISA detection, a temporal decrease in virus titer, or a delay in virus titer accumulation. Comparing all wild types to all transgenic lines over every assessment revealed significant decreases in virus titer in the transgenic lines compared to that of the wild type. An RNA entity with similarities to marafiviruses was identified in a CTV infected plant. The entity appears non-graft transmissible to citrus, and non-mechanically transmissible to a range of herbaceous species...|$|R
40|$|Seedlings of 41 {{different}} citrus {{species and}} varieties were massively colonized with the <b>citrus</b> brown <b>aphid</b> Toxoptera citricidus, obtained from Pêra sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) trees, presenting {{symptoms of the}} "Capão Bonito" complex of the Citrus tristeza virus (CTV). The objective was to evaluate resistance or tolerance of the varieties to that virus complex, but even after eight months of inoculation no stem pitting was observed in the plants. Otherwise, the presence of galls similar to those induced by the vein enation-woody gall disease was observed in 73 % of the plants of Volkamer Palermo (Citrus volkameriana), 60 % of the Volkamer Catania 2, 2 % of the Rangpur Lime D. 22. 30 (Citrus limonia), 13 % of the Volkamer Australian Red, the Rangpur Lime hybrid, the Orlando tangelo (Citrus reticulata x Citrus paradisi) and the Florida Rough lemon (C. jambhiri), and 7 % of the Carrizo citrange (Poncirus trifoliata x Citrus sinensis). The highest incidence and the largest gall size were observed in the Palermo Volkamer showing that this clone {{would be the most}} suitable to be used as an indicator plant in biological indexing tests for the disease.

40|$|Aphis spiraecola Patch. (Hemiptera: Aphididae) {{is a key}} pest of <b>citrus</b> {{clementine}}s. This <b>aphid</b> colonizes tender clementine shoots in {{the spring}} and causes important economic losses. A complex of predators preys on A. spiraecola colonies but does not result in satisfactory control. To disentangle the reasons for this failure, we investigated the effect of predators on A. spiraecola colonies and damage over a 3 -year period. A. spiraecola colonies were tracked every 48 – 72 h from the period of aphid colonization until the colony declined or disappeared. The number of aphids, their stage and the presence of predators were recorded in each colony. Different life parameters of A. spiraecola colonies (maximum number of aphids, longevity and colony phenology) varied among the orchards over 3 years. Predators attacked one-third of the colonies, and this did not significantly differ among orchards for the years studied. The maximum number of aphids and longevity of A. spiraecola colonies were not related to the ratio of colonies attacked by predators but were negatively correlated with the time of their first attack. More importantly, the percentage of shoots occupied by A. spiraecola remained below or close to the intervention threshold when colonies were attacked prior to ~ 200 degree days {{from the beginning of the}} aphid colonization. These results suggest that (1) the presence of predators at the beginning of the season should be considered to develop new intervention thresholds and (2) biological control programs should promote the early presence of predators in clementine orchards.
