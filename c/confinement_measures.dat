40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} project was to compile basic biological data on selected woody species with potential for genetic transformation or for field release in Central Europe and to derivate possible <b>confinement</b> <b>measures.</b> The following species have been chosen: Larix decidua, Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris, Populus spp., Prunus serotina, Robinia pseudoacacia, Juglans regia, Malus domesica, Pyrus communis, Prunus avium, Prunus cerasus, Prunus domestica, Prunus persica, Prunus armeniaca, Vitis vinifera and Rosa hybrida. At first, the goals that are being pursued using genetic engineering of lumber, fruit and ornamental trees are explained, followed by an overview of the release experiments that are currently in progress worldwide. The exotic species model, which is based on the (in some cases over centuries) continued spread of nonnative organisms, is discussed with respect to the release of transgenic woody species and employed for the prediction of spreading-behavior as well as the risk of introgression or hybridisation. In the compilation of basic data of above mentioned species both the parameters that are meaningful with respect to spreading of the transgenic clone or variety and the out-crossing of foreign genes, and those that are seen as crucial for the determination of <b>confinement</b> <b>measures</b> are considered.

40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (bTB) prevalence {{has generally}} been decreasing for several years in Portugal due to an ongoing UE funded eradication programme. Nevertheless, new outbreaks have been intermittently recorded in bTB free herds, especially in two Eastern regions of Portugal (Beira Interior and Portalegre District part of Alentejo region), with no evident explanation referred in official epidemiological surveys. At the same time, {{it has been reported}} that wild cervids (Cervus elaphus) population has been increasing in those regions. In order to study the possible role of these animals in bTB outbreaks, systematic culture, identification, spoligotyping and MIRU typing of 9 select loci were performed in M. bovis isolates from cattle and hunted deers with pathological lesions. The results indicate that cervids can harbour common spoligotypes, some of them already found in cattle of the same regions and also, in other regions of Portugal. MIRU typing further increased the discriminatory power in order to link cervids and cattle M. bovis isolates, reinforcing the probability of strain relatedness. These results allow us to conclude that cervids and cattle from these regions could have a common source of infection, or could transmit these strains between them. Although the direction of this possible transmission is unknown or could even function in both directions, these preliminary results should promote an increased awareness on the possible role of wild cervids on bTB maintenance in the regions studied, encouraging a systematic control of TB in deers and the implementation of <b>confinement</b> <b>measures</b> in herds neighbouring their natural habitat...|$|E
40|$|Rehabilitation Centres receive both {{children}} {{in need of}} protection and youths who have committed a criminal offence. In all cases, the Centre's mandate is to help them readjust to society. In pursuing this mandate, educators resort to measures of seclusion, time-out or withdrawal, whether for therapeutic or disciplinary reasons. All of these measures, however one wishes to call them, may be effected through confinement. The children are thus liable to be locked into their own room, into a specially designed time-out room or into a seclusion room, the time of confinement lasting anywhere from {{a few minutes to}} a few hours. Some rehabilitation programs, calling for measures such as time-out or withdrawal, currently allow for the possibility of confining a child in a locked room for some twenty hours a day, for several consecutive days. From a legal standpoint, confinement may constitute a form of therapy, or it may constitute a disciplinary measure. Depending on the reason for its implementation, seclusion therefore falls under different legal provisions. Yet in all cases, seclusion remains a coercive measure with a strong punitive component. It would therefore be logical for all <b>confinement</b> <b>measures</b> to be governed by the same set of legal rules.

In earlier limiter discharges, the plasma suffered a radiative collapse at high densities. In contrast to limiter experiments, where the impurity <b>confinement</b> time <b>measured</b> by Al laser blow-off increased with increasing line integrated density, in divertor discharges, above a density threshold, the impurity confinement time decreased with increasing line integrated density.

The maximum line integrated density reached with a divertor is compared to that reached with a limiter. The previously derived scaling law for the density limit with a limiter shows that the achieved densities do not exceed those predicted when the higher deposited power is taken into account. In a divertor the radiated power is located at the plasma edge and increasing the density, cooling the plasma edge and radiating sufficient power to cause plasma detachment determines the density limit...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{quantum confinement}} effects on silicon (Si) light source electroluminescence (EL) properties like quantum efficiency, external power efficiency and spectral emission, thin Si finger junctions with nanometre-scale dimensions were designed and manufactured in a fully customized silicon-on-insulator (SOI) semiconductor production technology. Since commonly available photolithography is unusable to consistently define and align nanometre-scale line-widths accurately and electron-beam lithography (EBL) {{by itself is}} too time-expensive to expose complete wafers, the wafer manufacturing process employed a selective combination of photolithography and EBL. The SOI wafers were manufactured in the clean-rooms of both the Carl and Emily Fuchs Institute for Microelectronics (CEFIM) at the University of Pretoria (UP) and the Georgia Institute of Technology’s Microelectronic Research Centre (MiRC), which made a JEOL JBX- 9300 FS electron-beam pattern generator (EPG) available. As far as is known {{this was the first}} project in South Africa (and possibly at the MiRC) that employed EBL to define functional nanometre-scale semiconductor devices. Since no standard process recipe could be employed, the complete design and manufacturing process was based on self-obtained equipment characterization data and material properties. The manufacturing process was unprecedented in both the CEFIM and MiRC clean-rooms. The manufacture of nanometre-scale Si finger junctions not only approached the manufacturing limits of the employed processing machinery, but also had to overcome undesirable physical effects that in larger-scale semiconductor manufacture usually are negligible. The device design, mask layout and manufacturing process therefore had to incorporate various material, equipment limitation and physical phenomena like impurity redistribution occurring during the physical manufacturing process. Although the complicated manufacturing process allowed many unexpected problems to occur, it was expected that at least the simple junction breakdown devices be functional and capable of delivering data regarding quantum confinement effects. Although due to design and processing oversights only 29 out of 505 measured SOI light sources were useful light emitters, the design and manufacture of the SOI light sources was successful in the sense that enough SOI light sources were available to conduct useful optical characterization measurements. In {{spite of the fact that}} the functional light sources did not achieve the desired horizontal (width) <b>confinement,</b> <b>measured</b> optical spectra of certain devices indicate that vertical (thickness) confinement had been achieved. All spectrometer-measured thickness-confined SOI light sources displayed a pronounced optical power for 600 nm < λ < 1 μm. The SOI light source with the highest optical power output emitted about 8 times more optical power around λ = 850 nm than a 0. 35 μm bulk-CMOS avalanche light-source operating at the same current. Possible explanations for this effect are given. It was shown that the buried oxide (BOX) layer in a SOI process could be used to reflect about 25 % of the light that would usually be lost to downward radiation back up, thereby increasing the external power efficiency of SOI light sources. This document elaborates on the technical objectives, approach, chip and process design, physical wafer manufacture, production process control and measurement of the nanometre-scale SOI light sources.

The electrical potential of the metallic <b>confinement</b> tube was <b>measured</b> using a high-voltage probe. It was found that an arc between the grounded injector and the metallic confinement tube is maintained by the electric field (E-mode). The transition to H-mode occurred at high magnetic fields when the arc formed a loop. An equivalent circuit for the set-up is proposed in order to assess the relative importance of the forces involved in the curvature of the arc (Lorentz force and drag force). As a result, the ignition voltage could be significantly reduced by connecting the metallic confinement tube with a capacitor to the RF generator. Consequently conditions to ignite an inductive plasma at atmospheric pressure operating a solid state power source can be achieved...|$|R
