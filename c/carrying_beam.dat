50|$|The wrench {{functions}} in the same general way as an ordinary beam torque wrench. There are two beams both connected to the head end but only one through which torque is applied. The load <b>carrying</b> <b>beam</b> is straight and runs from head to handle, it deflects when torque is applied. The other beam (indicating beam) runs directly above the deflecting beam for {{about half of the}} length then bends away to the side at an angle from the deflecting beam. The indicating beam retains its orientation and shape during operation, because of this there is relative displacement between the two beams. The deflecting beam torque wrench differs from the ordinary beam torque wrench in how it utilises this relative displacement. Attached to the deflecting beam is a scale and onto that is fitted a wedge which can be slid {{along the length of the}} scale parallel to the flexing beam, this wedge is used to set the desired torque. Directly facing this wedge is the side of the angled indicating beam. From this side protrudes a pin, which acts as a trigger for another pin, the latter pin is spring loaded, and fires out of the end of the indicating beam once the trigger pin contacts the adjustable wedge. This firing makes a loud click and gives a visual indication that the desired torque has been met. The indicator pin can be reset by simply pressing it back into the indicating beam.|$|E

40|$|Wavefront {{engineering}} {{is an important}} quantum technology. Here, we demonstrate the design and production of a robust C-shaped and orbital angular momentum (OAM) <b>carrying</b> <b>beam</b> in which the doughnut shaped structure contains an adjustable gap. We find {{that the presence of}} the vortex line in the core of the beam is crucial for the robustness of the C-shape against beam propagation. The topological charge of the vortex core controls mainly the size of the C, while its opening angle is controlled by the presence of vortex-anti-vortex loops. We demonstrate the generation and characterisation of C-shaped electron vortex beams, although the result is equally applicable to other quantum waves. Applications of C-shaped vortex beams include lithography, dynamical atom sorting and atomtronics. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|The Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) {{recirculating}} accelerator at Jefferson Lab {{consists of}} two linacs <b>carrying</b> <b>beam</b> {{for up to five}} passes of acceleration. The design of this accelerator anticipated the onset of multipass beam break-up (BBU) at a beam current of approximately 20 mA, far above the operational peak current of 200 μA. For {{more than a decade of}} operation, no sign of BBU was ever observed. However, a specially designed acceleration cavity in a cryomodule installed in the summer of 2007 has been observed to cause BBU instability with as low as 40 μA of injected beam current. This presented an opportunity to study BBU in a five-pass accelerator. In this paper we will discuss multipass BBU, present observational data, and discuss the ways we have developed to maintain the instability threshold current to values above those required for operation...|$|E
40|$|To {{reduce the}} induced {{undesired}} stresses, a power transmitting shaft or a load <b>carrying</b> <b>beam</b> should have its related area {{moment of inertia}} as large as possible. Similarly, to avoid early buckling and hence, to increase the capacity, a compressive load carrying strut should have a radius of gyration as large as possible. As the radius of gyration is directly proportional to the square root of area moment of inertia, a strut also should have its related area moment of inertia as large as possible. However, an increase in such moment of inertias comes {{with an increase in}} the transverse cross-sectional areas and hence, the weight of the members. Therefore, the maximization of moment of inertias should not take place at the cost of excessive weights of the members. Attempt has been made here to design optimum cross-sections for such load-carrying members, using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, for simultaneously maximizing moment of inertias and minimizing the crosssectional areas. The success of the work has been shown through a few case studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{flexible}} <b>beams</b> <b>carrying</b> attachments {{often appear}} in engineering structures, modal analysis of those structures {{is important and}} necessary in structural design. This manuscript develops a proposed analytical method as a general tool for solving the free vibration of varying cross-section <b>beams</b> <b>carrying</b> various types of attachments with different distributions and arbitrary boundary conditions. In current practice, the natural frequencies of <b>beam</b> <b>carrying</b> lumped and uniform sprung mass and resting on Pasternak soil are calculated and compared with those in references to verify the methodology firstly. Then, the natural frequencies of <b>beam</b> <b>carrying</b> non-uniform spring-mass systems and stepped beam on Pasternak soil are calculated by the proposed method to study free vibration of <b>beam</b> <b>carrying</b> attachments with non-uniform cross section or distribution. Finally, some important conclusions are derived from results, which reveal that distribution density of spring-mass system at peaks of the mode shape makes dominate effects on the change of the natural frequencies at that mode and the natural frequencies of the stepped beam resting on elastic foundation are {{more sensitive to the}} increase of soil parameters...|$|R

Poles are usually spaced 8' apart, with the trusses bearing directly on the poles. Some variations in design call for truss <b>carrying</b> <b>beams</b> between the posts with trusses sitting on them. The exterior walls consist of girts attached horizontally to the post with the exterior sheathing attached to them. Exterior walls may be finished with corrugated metal, plywood sheathing, vinyl siding, or other cladding.

Use high beams on construction more widely used, but its use was limited to meet the aesthetic desires and designed only to use only minimum reinforcement for flexural reinforcement and the reinforcement of existing high beam geser.

40|$|Discriminating data classes {{emanating from}} sensors is an {{important}} problem with many applications in science and technology. This study describes a new transform for pattern identification that interprets patterns as probability density functions, and has special properties with regards to classification. The transform, built upon the optimal transport theory, is invertible, with well defined forward and inverse operations. This study shows that the transform {{can be useful in}} ‘parsing out’ variations that are ‘Lagrangian’ (displacement and intensity variations) by converting these to ‘Eulerian’ (intensity variations) in transform space. This conversion is the basis for the main result that describes when the transforms can allow for linear classification to be possible in transform space. Demonstrated with computational experiments that used both real and simulated data, the transforms can help render a variety of real world problems simpler to solve. Moreover, making use of a newly developed theory suggesting a link between image turbulence and photon transport through the continuity equation, the transform is utilized to perform a decoding task for orbital angular momentum <b>carrying</b> <b>beam</b> patterns. Free space optical communications utilizing orbital angular momentum beams have recently emerged as a new technique for communications with potential for increased channel capacity. Turbulence due to changes in the index of refraction emanating from temperature, humidity, and air flow patterns, however, add nonlinear effects to the received patterns, thus making the demultiplexing task more difficult. The decoding technique is tested and compared against previous approaches using deep convolutional neural networks. Results show that the new method can obtain comparable classification accuracies (bit error rate) {{at a fraction of the}} computational cost, thus enabling higher bit rates...|$|E

Accompanying third-order nonlinear processes in the non-resonant nonlinear medium (NLM), which are accounted for, are self- and cross-phase modulation. In the case of pump OV beams with identical topological charges the model predicts the generation of signal <b>beams</b> <b>carrying</b> OVs of the same charge. If the pump <b>beams</b> <b>carry</b> OVs with opposite charges, the generated signals are predicted to carry triply charged vortices which, {{in the case of a}} non-negligible initial free-space propagation from the plane of vortex generation to the NLM, decay inside the NLM into three singly-charged vortices with highly overlapping cores...|$|R
