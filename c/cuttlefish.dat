5|$|Deimatic display {{occurs in}} widely {{separated}} groups of animals, including moths, butterflies, mantises and phasmids among the insects. In the cephalopods, {{different species of}} octopuses, squids, <b>cuttlefish</b> and the paper nautilus are deimatic.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{molluscs}} such as sea hares, <b>cuttlefish,</b> squid and octopuses {{give themselves}} a {{last chance to}} escape by distracting their attackers. To do this, they eject a mixture of chemicals, which may mimic food or otherwise confuse predators. In response to a predator, animals in these groups release ink, creating a cloud, and opaline, affecting the predator's feeding senses, causing it to attack the cloud.|$|E

Jellies: Living Art is {{a collaboration}} with the nearby Hunter Museum of American Art and includes rotating exhibits of art glass alongside the jellyfish.|$|E
5000|$|Sexual Reproduction Advantages Sexual mimicry {{is common}} among animals. Male <b>cuttlefishes</b> uses this {{strategy}} to gain advantage over other males competitor. They mimic female <b>cuttlefish’s</b> marking to fool guarding male and fertilize their females. This strategy has more success rate than normal courtship.|$|R

5|$|Volume II covers an {{assortment}} of topics: animals including sea creatures such as sea urchin, seahorse, whelk, mussel, crab, scorpion, electric ray, viper, <b>cuttlefish</b> and many others; dairy produce; cereals; vegetables such as sea kale, beetroot, asparagus; and sharp herbs such as garlic, leek, onion, caper and mustard.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage in {{relatively}} shallow waters {{is more like}} terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by many animals. For example, self-decoration is employed by decorator crabs; mimesis by animals such as the leafy sea dragon; countershading by many fish including sharks; distraction with eyespots by many fish; active camouflage through ability to change colour rapidly in fish such as the flounder, and cephalopods including octopus, <b>cuttlefish,</b> and squid.|$|E
5|$|Deimatic {{behaviour}} {{is found}} in cephalopods including the common <b>cuttlefish</b> Sepia officinalis, squid such as the Caribbean reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioidea) and bigfin reef squid (Sepioteuthis lessoniana), octopuses including the common octopus Octopus vulgaris and the Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Octopus macropus), and the paper nautilus (Argonauta argo). Deimatic cephalopod displays involve suddenly creating bold stripes, often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web {{to make it look}} as big and threatening as possible.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} speculated that <b>cuttlefish's</b> eyes are fully {{developed}} before birth, and that they start observing their surroundings while still in the egg. In consequence they may prefer to hunt the prey they saw before hatching.|$|R
40|$|The Class Cephalopoda {{comprising}} of squids, <b>cuttlefishes</b> and octopus {{includes the}} largest known living invertebrates within the animal Kingdom. Cephalopods have well developed {{head and a}} body consisting of a muscular mantle and mantle cavity. Head bears circumoral appendages (arms, tentacles), a feature that reflects {{the origin of the}} name ‘Cephalopoda’, which is derived from the union of the two Greek words: ‘kefale’, head, and ‘pous’, feet. These soft-bodied bilaterally symmetrical groups are commercially important fishery resources occurring in all marine habitats in depth ranging from intertidal to over 5, 000 m. Salinity is considered as the limiting factor restricting their distribution between 27 and 37 psu, with few exceptions. The <b>cuttlefishes</b> belonging to the family Sepiidae are of significant commercial value to artisanal and industrial fisheries. <b>Cuttlefishes</b> are primarily bottom-dwellers over a range of habitats, including rocky, sandy, and muddy substrates, seagrass, seaweed and coral reefs. They are slower swimmers than the more streamlined squids. <b>Cuttlefishes</b> are able to attain neutral buoyancy by regulating the relative amounts of gas and fluid in the chambers of the cuttlebone, and they are able to hover in midwater, with fins acting as stabilizers. Large species such as Sepia latimanus, S. officinalis and S. pharaonis are restricted to much shallower depths and show very different septal spacing and sutures than the deeper water species. Some species migrate seasonally in response to temperature changes and aggregate, usually in shallow water, at spawning time. <b>Cuttlefishes</b> have broad sac-like bodies with lateral fins that are narrow and extend {{along the length of the}} mantle; posterior lobes of the fins free (subterminal) and separated by the posterior end of the mantle; 10 circumoral appendages, the longest 2 (tentacles) are retractile into pockets on the ventrolateral sides of the head; the 8 remaining arms frequently with 4 series of stalked suckers with chitinous rings; eyes are covered with a transparent membrane and eyelids are present. They are characterized by the presence of a dorsally placed internal calcareous shell known as the cuttlebone, which is a finely chambered shell, thick, and chalky...|$|R
60|$|Yet other creatures--whelks, <b>cuttlefishes,</b> oysters, snails, and {{all their}} tribe (Mollusca)--resemble {{one another in the}} same way, but differ from both Vertebrata and Annulosa; and the like is true of the animals called Coelenterata (Polypes) and Protozoa (animalcules and sponges).|$|R
5|$|His {{observations}} on catfish, electric fish (Torpedo) and angler fish are detailed, {{as is his}} writing on cephalopods including the octopus, <b>cuttlefish</b> and the paper nautilus. His claim that the octopus had a hectocotyl arm which was perhaps used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved, until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays {{were part of the}} group he called Selachē (roughly, the modern zoologist's selachians).|$|E
5|$|The {{intertidal}} mud flats {{of the bay}} have a {{long history}} of use for fishing, with structures on Stert Flats being dated by dendrochronological analysis to between 932 and 966. It is the last site in England used for 'mudhorse fishing' in which a wooden sledge is propelled across the mudflats to collect fish from nets. Catches include: Thinlip mullet, plaice, dogfish, <b>cuttlefish,</b> skate, shrimp, prawns, sea bass, and sole. Watchet Boat Museum displays the unusual local flatner boats which were used for fishing in the bay, along with associated artefacts.|$|E
5|$|When {{movement}} is required, one {{strategy is to}} minimise the motion signal, for example by avoiding waving limbs about and by choosing patterns that do not cause flicker when seen by the prey from straight ahead. <b>Cuttlefish</b> may be doing this with their active camouflage by choosing to form stripes {{at right angles to}} their front-back axis, minimising motion signals that would be given by occluding and displaying the pattern as they swim.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} marine animals possess active {{camouflage}} through {{their ability to}} change colour rapidly. Several bottom-living fish such as the flounder can hide themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds. Many cephalopods including octopus, <b>cuttlefish,</b> and squid similarly use colour change, in their case both for camouflage and signalling. For example, the big blue octopus, Octopus cyanea, hunts during the day, and can match itself to the colours and textures of its surroundings, both to avoid predators and to enable it to approach prey. It can perfectly resemble a rock or a coral it is hiding beside. When necessary, in order to scare away a potential predator, it can display markings which resemble eyes.|$|E
5|$|For example, in {{the common}} <b>cuttlefish</b> the display {{consists}} of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the eyes. The common octopus similarly displays pale skin and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and stretches out the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: it suddenly withdraws the shining iridescent web formed by its first pair of arms from its shell.|$|E
5|$|In fish {{such as the}} herring which live in {{shallower}} water, {{the mirrors}} must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks {{with a range of}} different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically. Silvering is found in other marine animals as well as fish. The cephalopods, including squid, octopus and <b>cuttlefish,</b> have multi-layer mirrors made of protein rather than guanine.|$|E

5|$|Like {{other members}} of the genus Sepioteuthis, bigfin reef squids are easy to {{distinguish}} from other squids in that they possess thick and muscular oval fins that extend around almost the entire mantle. The fins extend about 83 to 97% of the mantle length and are 67 to 70% of the mantle length in width. Because of these fins, bigfin reef squids are sometimes mistaken for <b>cuttlefish,</b> a fact reflected by their scientific names. A narrow blue or white line is visible at the point of attachment of the fins to the mantle. A fleshy ridge is also present where the fins meet {{at the back of the}} squid.|$|E
5|$|Molluscs are {{the largest}} marine phylum, {{comprising}} about 23% of all the named marine organisms. Numerous molluscs also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are highly diverse, not just in size and in anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and in habitat. The phylum is typically divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. Cephalopod molluscs, such as squid, <b>cuttlefish</b> and octopus, {{are among the most}} neurologically advanced of all invertebrates—and either the giant squid or the colossal squid is the largest known invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails and slugs) are by far the most numerous molluscs in terms of classified species, and account for 80% of the total.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} (if not the most) {{abundant}} near-shore sharks within its range, the milk shark feeds mainly on small benthic and schooling bony fishes. Occasionally squid, octopus, <b>cuttlefish,</b> crabs, shrimp, and gastropods are also taken. In Shark Bay, the most important prey are silversides, herring, smelt-whitings, and wrasses; {{this is also the}} only local shark species that preys on the Waigeo seaperch (Psammoperca waigiensis), found in seagrass beds avoided by other sharks. In the Gulf of Carpentaria, it feeds mainly on halfbeaks, herring, and mullets, and is also a major predator of penaeid prawns. Smaller sharks eat proportionately more cephalopods and crustaceans, switching to fish as they grow older.|$|E

5|$|The octopus (along with <b>cuttlefish)</b> has {{the highest}} brain-to-body mass ratios of all invertebrates, and is also greater than many vertebrates. It has a highly complex nervous system, only part of which is {{localised}} in its brain, which is contained in a cartilaginous capsule. Two-thirds of an octopus's neurons {{are found in the}} nerve cords of its arms, which show a variety of complex reflex actions that persist even when they have no input from the brain. Unlike vertebrates, the complex motor skills of octopuses are not organised in their brain via an internal somatotopic map of its body, instead using a nonsomatotopic system unique to large-brained invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|When {{cephalopod}} molluscs like squid and <b>cuttlefish</b> {{find themselves}} against a light background, they contract {{many of their}} chromatophores, concentrating the pigment into a smaller area, resulting in a pattern of tiny, dense, but widely spaced dots, appearing light. When they enter a darker environment, they allow their chromatophores to expand, creating a pattern of larger dark spots, and making their bodies appear dark. Amphibians such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped chromatophore cells in separate layers of their skin. The top layer contains 'xanthophores' with orange, red, or yellow pigments; the middle layer contains 'iridophores' with a silvery light-reflecting pigment; while the bottom layer contains 'melanophores' with dark melanin.|$|E
5|$|As {{often the}} most {{abundant}} apex predator within its ecosystem, the blacktip reef shark {{plays a major role}} in structuring inshore ecological communities. Its diet is composed primarily of small teleost fishes, including mullet, groupers, grunters, jacks, mojarras, wrasses, surgeonfish, and smelt-whitings. Groups of blacktip reef sharks in the Indian Ocean have been observed herding schools of mullet against the shore for easier feeding. Squid, octopus, <b>cuttlefish,</b> shrimp, and mantis shrimp are also taken, as well as carrion and smaller sharks and rays, though this is rare. Off northern Australia, this species is known to consume sea snakes, including Acrochordus granulatus, Hydrelaps darwiniensis, Hydrophis spp. and Lapemis hardwickii. Sharks off Palmyra Atoll have been documented preying on seabird chicks that have fallen out of their nests into the water. Miscellaneous items that have been found inside the stomachs of this species include algae, turtle grass, coral, hydrozoa, bryozoa, rats, and stones.|$|E
