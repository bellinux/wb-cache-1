5|$|Some hemipterans {{are used}} to produce dyestuffs such as carmine (also called cochineal). The scale insect Dactylopius coccus {{produces}} the brilliant red-coloured <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> to deter predators. Up to 100,000 scale insects are {{needed to make a}} kilogram (2.2lbs) of cochineal dye.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{some other}} red dyes {{obtained}} from scale insects, the red coloring is derived from <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> with traces of kermesic acid. The Polish cochineal <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> content is approximately 0.6% of the insect's dried body weight. The insects were harvested shortly before the female larvae reached maturity, i.e. in late June, usually around Saint John the Baptist's day (June 24), hence the dye's folk name, Saint John's blood. The harvesting process involved uprooting the host plant and picking the female larvae, averaging approximately ten insects from each plant. In Poland, including present-day Ukraine, and elsewhere in Europe, plantations were operated {{in order to deal}} with the high toll on the host plants. The larvae were killed with boiling water or vinegar and dried in the sun or in an oven, ground, and dissolved in sourdough or in light rye beer called kvass in order to remove fat. The extract could then be used for dyeing silk, wool, cotton, or linen. The dyeing process requires roughly 3-4oz of dye per pound (180-250g per kilogram) of silk and one pound of dye to color almost 20pounds (50g per kilogram) of wool.|$|E
25|$|The insect {{produces}} <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> that deters predation {{by other}} insects. <b>Carminic</b> <b>acid,</b> typically 17-24% of dried insects' weight, can be {{extracted from the}} body and eggs, then mixed with aluminium or calcium salts to make carmine dye, also known as cochineal. Today, carmine is primarily used as a colorant in food and in lipstick.|$|E
25|$|The carmine {{of antiquity}} also {{contains}} <b>carminic</b> <b>acid,</b> and was extracted {{from a similar}} insect, Kermes vermilio, which lives on Quercus coccifera oaks native to the Near East and the European side of the Mediterranean Basin. Kermes carmine {{was used as a}} dye and a laked pigment in ancient Egypt, Greece, and the Near East {{and is one of the}} oldest organic pigments. Recipes for artists' use of carmine appear in many early painting and alchemical handbooks throughout the Middle Ages; the laking process for both pigments was improved in the 19th century. Carmine was not light-fast and was largely abandoned in art.|$|E
25|$|The two {{principal}} forms of cochineal dye are cochineal extract, a colouring {{made from the}} raw dried and pulverised bodies of insects, and carmine, a more purified colouring made from the cochineal. To prepare carmine, the powdered insect bodies are boiled in ammonia or a sodium carbonate solution, the insoluble matter is removed by filtering, and alum {{is added to the}} clear salt solution of <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> to precipitate the red aluminium salt. Purity of colour is ensured by the absence of iron. Stannous chloride, citric acid, borax, or gelatin may be added to regulate the formation of the precipitate. For shades of purple, lime is added to the alum.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Carminic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{extracted}} from the female cochineal insects and is treated to produce carmine, which can yield shades of red such as crimson and scarlet. The body of the insect is [...] 19–22% <b>carminic</b> <b>acid.</b> The insects are processed by immersion in hot water or exposure to sunlight, steam, or the heat of an oven. Each method produces a different colour that results in the varied appearance of commercial cochineal. The insects must be dried to about 30% of their original body weight {{before they can be}} stored without decaying. It takes about 80,000 to 100,000 insects to make one kilogram of cochineal dye.|$|E
2500|$|The carmine {{dyestuff}} of Porphyrophora hamelii {{owes its}} red color almost entirely to <b>carminic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{making it difficult}} to distinguish chemically from the dyestuff of cochineal from the Americas. [...] The dyestuff of Porphyrophora polonica can be distinguished by its small admixture of kermesic acid, which is the major constituent of kermes from Kermes vermilio.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} structure of <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> {{consists of a}} core anthraquinone structure linked to a glucose sugar unit. <b>Carminic</b> <b>acid</b> was first synthesized in the laboratory by organic chemists in 1991.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carminic</b> <b>acid</b> (C22H20O13) {{is a red}} glucosidal hydroxyanthrapurin {{that occurs}} {{naturally}} in some scale insects, such as the cochineal, Armenian cochineal, and Polish cochineal. The insects produce the acid {{as a deterrent to}} predators. An aluminum salt of <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> is the coloring agent in carmine. Synonyms are C.I. 75470 and C.I. Natural Red 4.|$|E

5000|$|Carmine may be {{prepared}} from cochineal, by boiling dried insects in water {{to extract the}} <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> and then treating the clear solution with alum. Other common substances such as cream of tartar, stannous chloride, or potassium hydrogen oxalate {{can also be used}} to effect the precipitation, but aluminum is needed for the color. Use of these chemicals causes the coloring and animal matters present in the liquid to be precipitated to give a lake pigment. Aluminum from the alum gives the traditional crimson color to <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> precipitates, which are called [...] "carmine lakes" [...] or [...] "crimson lakes". This color is degraded by the presence of iron salts. Addition of lime (calcium) can give <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> lakes a purple cast.|$|E
50|$|Dactylopius coccus is a {{scale insect}} from which {{cochineal}} dye is derived. D. coccus itself {{is native to}} tropical and subtropical South America and Mexico. This insect, a primarily sessile parasite, lives on cacti from the genus Opuntia, feeding on moisture and nutrients in the cactus sap. The insect produces <b>carminic</b> <b>acid,</b> which deters predation by other insects. The <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> can be extracted from the insect's body and eggs to make the red dye.|$|E
50|$|In the 19th century, {{lipstick}} was colored with carmine dye. Carmine dye was {{extracted from}} cochineal, scale insects native to Mexico and Central America which live on cactus plants.

50|$|In the European Union, {{the use of}} carmine {{in foods}} is {{regulated}} under the European Commission's directives governing food additives in general and food dyes in particular and listed under the names Cochineal, <b>Carminic</b> <b>acid,</b> Carmines and Natural Red 4 as additive E 120 {{in the list of}} EU-approved food additives. The directive governing food dyes approves the use of carmine for certain groups of foods only and specifies a maximum amount which is permitted or restricts it to the quantum satis.|$|E
50|$|From Gdańsk, ships, {{mostly from}} the Netherlands and Flanders, carried the grain to ports such as Antwerp and Amsterdam.

50|$|Red {{clothing}} {{was a sign}} of status and wealth. It was worn not only by cardinals and princes, but also by merchants, artisans and townpeople, particularly on holidays or special occasions. Red dye for the clothing of ordinary people was made from the roots of the rubia tinctorum, the madder plant. This color leaned toward brick-red, and faded easily in the sun or during washing. The wealthy and aristocrats wore scarlet clothing dyed with kermes, or carmine, made from the <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> in tiny female scale insects, which lived on the leaves of oak trees in Eastern Europe and around the Mediterranean. The insects were gathered, dried, crushed, and boiled with different ingredients in a long and complicated process, which produced a brilliant scarlet.|$|E
50|$|Other hemipterans have {{positive}} uses for humans, {{such as in}} the production of the dyestuff carmine (cochineal). The FDA has created guidelines for how to declare when it has been added to a product. The scale insect Dactylopius coccus produces the brilliant red-coloured <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> to deter predators. Up to 100,000 scale insects need to be collected and processed to make a kilogram (2.2 lbs) of cochineal dye. A similar number of lac bugs are needed to make a kilogram of shellac, a brush-on colourant and wood finish. Additional uses of this traditional product include the waxing of citrus fruits to extend their shelf-life, and the coating of pills to moisture-proof them, provide slow-release or mask the taste of bitter ingredients.|$|E
50|$|The dried {{bodies of}} the female insects are roughly 12 to 16% <b>carminic</b> <b>acid.</b> The carmine {{obtained}} is a shade of crimson, and this can be turned different shades by adding metal ions or changing the pH; tin salts or acids produce a bright scarlet, while iron or alkaline compounds turn it a deep purple. The Salasacas of Ecuador still use this process to color their textiles, particularly a red woolen garment worn by women around the shoulders, which each woman personalizes by choosing a different shade of red. They collect cochineals, probably D. confusus, from the wild, press them into cakes, and use the dried cakes to dye the garments three at a time. One is left crimson, one is soaked in lemon juice to turn it scarlet, {{and the third is}} rubbed with wood ashes to turn it purple.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purity of}} {{synthetic}} <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> was quantified using potentiometric and conductimetric titrations, allowing its {{use as a}} secondary standard because {{there is not a}} primary one. Polarographic analysis (in ethanol-water 50 : 50, v/v) of <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> showed two reduction signals, each with a different number of electrons. The first reduction had more Nernstian behaviour and can be applied in analyses. Differential pulse polarography (DPP) produced a detection limit of 0. 55 µg mL- 1. The results indicate that DPP can be used to determine <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> content in cochineal extracts...|$|E
40|$|Photo-excited <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> and carminic acid–DNA {{complexes}} in {{a buffer}} solution at pH 7 {{have been examined}} {{using a variety of}} spectroscopy techniques, that are in particular, the femtosecond resolved fluorescence upconversion and transient absorption spectroscopy. The observation of dual fluorescence emission, one peaks at 470 nm and the other at 570 nm, indicates to an excited-state (S 1) intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). A detailed analysis of the transient absorption measurements of an aqueous carminic-acid solution at pH 7 yielded four lifetimes for the excited-state (S 1) : 8, 15, 33 and 46 ps. On the other hand, only two lifetimes, 34 and 47 ps, were observed by fluorescence upconversion spectroscopy because of the detection limitation to the long wavelength edge of the carminic-acid spectrum. The four S 1 lifetimes were ascribed to the coexistence of respectively two tautomer (normal and tautomer) forms of <b>carminic</b> <b>acid,</b> in the non-dissociated state (CAH) and in the deprotonated state (CA−). The fluorescence upconversion measurements of carminic acid–DNA complexes exhibited a prolongation of the fluorescence lifetimes. This effect was accepted as evidence for the formation of intercalation complexes between the <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> and the DNA. The intercalative binding of the <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> to DNA was confirmed by the fluorescence titration experiments resulting to a binding constant of 2 × 105 M− 1 that is typical for anthracycline–DNA complexes...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to prepare a red organic pigment named {{cochineal}} carmine. The pigment was made out of dried insect called Coccus cacti using historical recipe. Next goal was to detect <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> by infrared spectroscopy with Fourier transform (FTIR) in dried bodies of the mentioned insect, then in the pigment prepared from it and in the pigment that was prepared using extract called carminum rubrum. The other results of this work were the comprehension of the origin and preparation of carmine pigment and the identification of <b>carminic</b> <b>acid</b> in both prepared pigments...|$|E
