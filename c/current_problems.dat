5|$|For example, the Security Council passed no resolutions on {{most major}} Cold War conflicts, {{including}} the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–Afghan War. Resolutions addressing more <b>current</b> <b>problems,</b> {{such as the}} conflict between Israel and Palestine and Iran's suspected development of nuclear weapons, are also heavily influenced by the veto, actual or threatened. Additionally, the veto applies to {{the selection of the}} UN's Secretary-General, as well as any amendments to the UN Charter, giving the P5 great influence over these processes. Recently China also exercised its VETO on India's Resolution to put Masood Azhar on list of Global terrorist list. He is proclaimed head of Jaish E Mohammad a terror Outfit which is already designated as Global terrorist group by UNSC.|$|E

25|$|David Uckotter, {{who was the}} {{engineering}} director for the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government during the road's construction, also noted that Man o' War had to be designed and built around numerous subdivisions that were sprouting throughout south Lexington in that era. He indicated that this dictated a 120-foot right-of-way, which left no room for breakdown lanes. Uckotter also added {{that at the time}} Man o' War was proposed, plans were on the table for a southern beltway similar to New Circle Road outside Man o' War, hugging the border between Lexington and Jessamine County. These plans were dropped in the early 1980s, leaving Man o' War as Lexington's only circumferential road outside New Circle, which Uckotter contends has contributed to <b>current</b> <b>problems</b> with Man o' War.|$|E
25|$|Capitalism is decried in Petals of Blood, {{with the}} new Kenyan elite portrayed as {{controlled}} by the 'faceless system of capitalism'. The everyman loses out to capitalist endeavours, and is essentially exploited by the new Kenyan elite. Farmers are forced to mark out their lands and mortgage them with loans linked {{to the success of}} their harvest; as the quality of the harvests waver, many are forced to sell their land, unable to match their loan repayments. Thang'eta is another symbol of capitalism. Taken from a drink that Nyakinyua brews in a traditional ceremony, it is soon marketed, and becomes extremely popular. Wanja, who introduces the drink to Abdulla's bar, is then exploited by big business who forces her to stop her Thang'eta operation. Neither she nor Munira, who creates the slogan, receive the fruits of their labour. Originally a drink used to help people relax and escape their <b>current</b> <b>problems,</b> it becomes 'a drink of strife'.|$|E

His course description for the Design Laboratory read: The aim of the course is to help the student to discover his individuality, crystallize his taste, and develop his feeling for the contemporary trend by stimulating his sense of invention and perfecting his technical ability. The course is conducted as an experimental laboratory, inspired by the ever-changing tempo of life, discovery of new techniques, new fields of operation...in close contact with <b>current</b> <b>problems</b> of leading magazines, department stores, advertising agencies and manufactures.

25|$|There {{were many}} {{concerns}} expressed by local residents and historic preservationists by the successful Trump bid. Preservationists believed Trump would not respect the historic {{nature of the}} building and had almost no experience renovating historic properties but government officials said any redesign would need to be approved by the Commission of Fine Arts (whose secretary signaled heavy scrutiny for any changes). Trump dismissed concerns that he lacked experience with historic buildings, pointing to his redevelopment of Grand Central Terminal in New York City and the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. Some city residents worried that Trump would block access to the clock tower. However, the National Park Service said it will retain control over the clock tower and observation deck and it will keep them open for tours. Washington Post business columnist Steven Pearlstein questioned the financial wisdom of selecting Trump/Colony Capital, given Trump's extensive problems with bankruptcy and Colony Capital's <b>current</b> <b>problems</b> keeping its hotel properties out of receivership. Pearlstein and local hoteliers argued that the market would not support the room rates Trump wished to charge, and therefore {{would not be able to}} support the excessive amount of redevelopment money and rent Trump was paying for the property. Robert Peck, Commissioner of the General Services Administration, defended the selection, arguing that the Trump/Colony Capital bid was by far the best in terms of financial commitment, experience in renovating and managing properties, and quality of design. Peck dismissed criticism about Trump's numerous past bankruptcies, noting that these mostly concerned casinos rather than hotels.|$|E

In both scenarios, the projected warming will be more pronounced during the summer months. The predicted trend for precipitation is not as clear as the one for temperature. In the northern and central regions, precipitation is predicted to increase while in most of central–western Argentina and Patagonia, precipitation is predicted to decrease. Because Argentina is potentially vulnerable to climate change, such projected changes based on the models could exacerbate <b>current</b> <b>problems</b> or create new problems associated with climate change in Argentina.|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{importance}} of knowledge reuse much is still unknown about how knowledge management artifacts influence reuse in practice. In this paper we use the concept of scaffolding to explore how knowledge repositories influence knowledgeable action. We conceptualize anchoring and adjustment as the processes involved in the use of scaffolding such as knowledge repositories. By viewing reuse in terms of these mechanisms, we can begin to consider the reuse processes individually as involving (1) choice of document for reuse and (2) adaptation of the document’s suggested solution applied to a <b>current</b> <b>problem.</b> We suggest the document acts as an anchor to frame the <b>current</b> <b>problem</b> consistent with the problem solved in the document, and that the suggested solution is then adapted through the adjustment process {{to meet the needs of}} the <b>current</b> <b>problem.</b> We subsequently explore the factors that influence both anchor choice and adjustment...|$|R

Our approach uses explanations to approximate relations between a problem description and its solution, and the adaptation process is guided by these explanations (a more detailed presentation has been done in [4]). 1 CBR and adaptation In problem solving, CBR avoids complex inferences by reusing past problem solving episodes. We hope that if the <b>current</b> <b>problem</b> is similar to a previous one, then the solution of the past problem should be reusable for the <b>current</b> <b>problem</b> with a low adaptation cost. As target and source generally always have some differences, the objective of the adaptation process is tending to focalize on these differences and to reflect them on the solution of the new problem.

2500|$|As to {{the history}} of philosophy, Vollenhoven {{concentrated}} on developing a problem-historical method. A philosopher finds himself in a network of relations with his contemporaries and predecessors. This is reflected in his philosophical position, on the one hand in how he deals with <b>current</b> <b>problems</b> of his time and attempts to supersede them, on the other hand in evidencing preference for how a specific tradition of thought treats the problems that recur in all thought. The discussion of <b>current</b> <b>problems</b> is usually conducted in terms of a uniformity of style, focusing on those features that are taken to be normative or involving a view of truth or of law that is deemed fitting for such contemporary discussions. Seen from a greater range of time, the distinct styles of what were contemporary approaches give rise to historically distinct periods, in temporal succession, that Vollenhoven refers to as “time-currents” in philosophy (e.g., Hellenism, Neoplatonism, Waning Middle Ages, the Age of Enlightenment, Positivism, Existentialism, Postmodernism).|$|E
