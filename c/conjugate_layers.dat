30|$|Recently, the MIMO {{system has}} gained {{increased}} interest. Most {{of the existing}} wireless networks are paying considerable attention toward MIMO implementation. They are expecting to meet their ever increasing capacity demand (mostly from higher data rate services like video teleconferencing, multimedia streaming, etc.) by exploiting MIMO offered spectral efficiency at the physical layer (PHY) [3, 4]. However, from a network point of view, only an increased capacity in one specific layer {{is not sufficient to}} improve an overall network performance. Moreover, each layer must be aware of the changes that have occurred in the <b>conjugate</b> <b>layers</b> and their applied protocols must be smart enough to realize the resulting effects positively [5]. Hence, even though the MIMO implementation can increase the PHY capacity, such independently enhanced capacity cannot be translated easily into MAC layer capacity gain unless an applied MAC protocol is also MIMO aware.|$|E

The characterization of a yellow-green LED that involves an Al cathode and {{a thin layer of}} the new compound spin cast from a methanol solution has shown device performances comparable to those obtained with a Ba/Al cathode. Photovoltaic measurements under white light irradiation reveal that a thin layer of the new compound can significantly increase the built-in potential and thus facilitate electron injection from an Al cathode.

30|$|Evenly {{separated}} crystalline CuIn 0.8 Ga 0.2 Se 2 (CIGS) nanoparticles are {{deposited on}} ITO-glass substrate by pulsed laser deposition. Such CIGS layers are introduced between <b>conjugated</b> polymer <b>layers</b> and ITO-glass substrates for enhancing light absorbance of polymer solar cells. The P 3 HT:PCBM absorbance between 300 and 650 nm is enhanced obviously {{due to the}} introduction of CIGS nanoparticles. The current density-voltage curves of a P 3 HT:PCBM/CIGS solar cell demonstrate that the short-circuit current density is improved from 0.77 to 1.20 mA/cm 2. The photoluminescence spectra show that the excitons in the polymer are obviously quenched, suggesting that the charge transfer between the P 3 HT:PCBM and CIGS occurred. The results reveal that the CIGS nanoparticles may exhibit the localized surface plasmon resonance effect just as metallic nanostructures.|$|R
30|$|The global {{distribution}} of ESF occurrence {{in previous studies}} (Gentile et al. 2006; Kil et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2014) {{is similar to that}} of large-amplitude ESF irregularities in Fig.  9 b. The characteristics of the distribution are that the ESF occurrence probability is high during equinoctial months (March, April, September, and October) and around −[*] 60 o longitude in December solstice and becomes low around ±[*] 60 o near June solstice. The high occurrence of ESF (the large-amplitude ESF irregularities in Fig.  9 b) during equinoctial months is explained as the consequence of the alignment between the geomagnetic field lines and the solar terminator when sunset at the <b>conjugate</b> E <b>layers</b> is nearly simultaneous (Tsunoda 1985). The underlying physics is that the longitudinal gradient in field-line-integrated Pedersen conductivity becomes steepest, so eastward polarization electric field, corresponding to vertical plasma drift, is enhanced under the alignment condition.|$|R
40|$|The ideal {{black body}} fully absorbs all {{incident}} rays, that is, all propagating waves created by arbitrary sources. A known idealized {{realization of the}} black body is the perfectly matched layer (PML), widely used in numerical electromagnetics. However, ideal black bodies and PMLs do not interact with evanescent fields that exists near any finite-size source, and the energy stored in these fields cannot be harvested.

Conjugate matched absorbers have exciting application potentials, as resonant attractors of electromagnetic energy into the absorber volume.

30|$|So far, several {{deposition}} and post-treatment techniques, such as thermal co-evaporation, sputtering, electrodeposition, and selenization of prefabricated metallic layers, {{have been}} tried to achieve the requirements for CIGS syntheses [9 – 12]. The difficulties to control the stoichiometry of the CIGS thin films make these processes very complicated and much expensive. As one of the alternative techniques, pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a convenient, economical, and effective method to deposit multi-component films because of its congruent ablation proceedings [13, 14]. In this article, a YAG:Nd laser was used in PLD to deposit CuIn 0.8 Ga 0.2 Se 2 nanoparticles on ITO-glass substrates. The CIGS nanoparticles deposited at 400 °C were introduced between the <b>conjugated</b> polymer <b>layers</b> and ITO electrodes in the photovoltaic structures of polymer solar cells to improve their light absorption and current density-voltage performance.

A network of instruments including digisondes, optical imagers, and GPS receivers, were deployed at magnetic conjugate and dip equatorial locations, in a geometry that permitted field line mapping of the <b>conjugate</b> E <b>layers</b> to dip equatorial F layer bottomside.

In addition, the process design integrates contact pads, which has been an issue for small scale conducting polymer actuators.

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the CIGS nanoparticles on the light absorption and charge separation efficiency of the <b>conjugated</b> polymer active <b>layers,</b> we measured the UV-visible-infrared absorption and PL spectra of the P 3 HT:PCBM layers with and without the CIGS interlayers (prepared on ITO-glass substrates). Figure  4 b displays the absorption spectra of CIGS/ITO, P 3 HT:PCBM/ITO, sum of CIGS and P 3 HT:PCBM, and P 3 HT:PCBM/CIGS/ITO. Obviously, the CIGS interlayer enhances the light absorption of the P 3 HT:PCBM active layer in the spectral range of 300 to 650 nm. More importantly, the absorption intensity of P 3 HT:PCBM/CIGS/ITO is much larger than that of the sum of CIGS/ITO and P 3 HT:PCBM/ITO. It {{should be noted that the}} thickness of the P 3 HT:PCBM monolayer is approximately equal to that of the CIGS/P 3 HT:PCBM bilayer (about 100 nm) according to the cross-sectional SEM image (see Figure  2 c), i.e., the enhancement of light absorption is not due to the thickness change of the P 3 HT:PCBM layer. Moreover, the CIGS interlayer absorbs only very little incident light. Therefore, most of the increased absorption should come from the P 3 HT:PCBM close to the interfaces between the P 3 HT:PCBM and CIGS nanoparticles. The mechanism may be similar to the localized surface plasmon resonant (LSPR) effect [16 – 20]. It has been known that the excitation of the LSPR through the resonant interaction between the electromagnetic field of incident light and the surface charge of metallic nanostructures causes an electric field enhancement (that can be coupled to the photoactive absorption region) and increases the absorption of photoactive conjugate polymer or organic semiconductor [21 – 23]. The above results demonstrate that the semiconductor CIGS nanoparticles may also exhibit LSPR effect just as metallic nanostructures do. As demonstrated in Figure  4 a, the incident light is trapped by the excitation of localized surface plasmons on the surface of CIGS nanoparticles embedded in P 3 HT, and the near field of the excited particles causes the creation of the electron-hole pairs in the P 3 HT. This is very important for the <b>conjugated</b> polymer <b>layers</b> of hybrid solar cells to absorb more incident light (through ITO-glass). If the introduced CIGS interlayer with a narrower bandgap is a continuous thin film rather than scattered nanoparticles, it may absorb too much incident light and decrease rather than increase the light absorption of the photoactive polymer layer behind it. Therefore, the light absorption enhancement induced by the CIGS nanoparticles could permit a considerable reduction in the physical thickness of the <b>conjugated</b> polymer <b>layers</b> in hybrid solar cells and yield some new options for hybrid solar cell design. The PL results in Figure  4 c show that the excitons in the polymer are obviously quenched. It has been known that the charge transfer normally occurs with a very high efficiency if excitons are formed in a conducting polymer within approximately 20 nm of a CIGS/P 3 HT:PCBM interface [23, 24]. The above phenomenon suggests that polymer chains were successfully penetrated into the pores of the CIGS nanoparticles, and hole transfer from the polymer to CIGS occurred. The quenching efficiency of a hybrid system can be estimated by calculating the integrated area beneath each curve [25]. The quenching efficiency of P 3 HT/CIGS in this experiment was calculated to be about 46 %.|$|R
40|$|The semiconductor-electrode {{interface}} impacts {{the function}} {{and the performance}} of (opto) electronic devices. For printed organic electronics the electrode surface is not atomically clean leading to weakly interacting interfaces. As a result, solution-processed organic ultrathin films on electrodes typically form islands due to dewetting. It has therefore been utterly difficult to achieve homogenous ultrathin conjugated polymer films. This has made the investigation of the correct energetics of the conjugated polymer-electrode interface impossible. Also, this has hampered the development of devices including ultrathin <b>conjugated</b> polymer <b>layers.</b> Here, LangmuirShafer-manufactured homogenous mono-and multilayers of semiconducting polymers on metal electrodes are reported and the energy level bending using photoelectron spectroscopy is tracked. The amorphous films display an abrupt energy level bending that does not extend beyond the first monolayer.

Immunoinflammatory markers detect only a modest tissue reaction to the surgical insult and the foreign body that peaks shortly after surgery and progressively decreases with time to normal levels at five months after implantation. Importantly, the integrity of the polymeric layer in direct contact with the retinal tissue is preserved after five months of implantation.

40|$|The {{speed with}} which {{electromagnetic}} energy can be wirelessly transferred from a source to the user is a crucial indicator {{for the performance of}} a large number of electronic and photonic devices. We expect that energy transfer can be enhanced using special materials. In this paper, we determine the constituent parameters of a medium which can support theoretically infinite energy concentration close to its boundary; such a material combines properties of Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) and Double-Negative (DNG) media. It realizes conjugate matching with free space for every possible mode including, most importantly, all evanescent modes; we call this medium <b>Conjugate</b> Matched <b>Layer</b> (CML). Sources located outside such layer deliver power to the conjugate-matched body exceptionally effectively, impressively overcoming the black-body absorption limit which takes into account only propagating waves. We also expand this near-field concept related to the infinitely fast absorption of energy along the air-medium interface to enhance the far-field radiation. This becomes possible with the use of small particles randomly placed along the boundary; the induced currents due to the extremely high-amplitude resonating fields can play the role of emission ‘‘vessels’’, by sending part of the theoretically unlimited near-field energy far away from the CML structure.

The brightness of the SWNT-FPEL device is much greater than those of other AC-based organic or even inorganic ELs that generally require at least a few hundred volts.

40|$|Understanding the {{spectral}} properties of boundary integral operators in acoustic scattering has important practical implications, such {{as for the}} analysis of the stability of boundary element discretisations or the convergence of iterative solvers as the wavenumber k grows. Yet little is known about spectral decompo- sitions of the standard boundary integral operators in acoustic scattering. Theoretical results are mainly available on the unit disk, where these operators diagonalise in a simple Fourier basis. In this paper we investigate spectral decompositions for more general smooth domains. Based on the decomposition of the acoustic Green’s function in elliptic coordinates we give spectral decompositions on ellipses. For general smooth domains we show that approximate spectral decompositions can be given in terms of circle Fourier modes transplanted onto the boundary of the domain. An important underlying {{question is whether or not}} the operators are normal. Based on previous numerical investigations it appears that the standard boundary integral operators are normal only when the domain is a ball and here we prove that this is indeed the case for the acoustic single layer potential. We show that the acoustic single, double and <b>conjugate</b> double <b>layer</b> potential are normal in a scaled inner product on the ellipse.

Highly luminescent anionic CdTe nanocrystals were prepared by aqueous synthesis method using 3 -mercaptopropionic acid as stabilizer. The resultant CdTe served as electron acceptor and poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) {{was used as}} electron donor. Through the electrostatic interactions between cationic PPV precursor poly(p-xylene tetrahydrothiophenium chloride) and anionic poly(sodium 4 -styrenesulfonate) (PSS), PPV/PSS complex was fabricated {{on the surface of}} pretreated quartz substrate by layer-by-layer electrostatic self-assembly method. UV-Vis spectrum shows that PSS in the PPV/PSS complex make PPV precursors thermally convert into PPV at a lower temperature and less time. PPV/ PSS/PPV/CdTe multilayer were fabricated on the surface of quartz substrate by electrostatic self-assembly method. The surface of the polymer/CdTe complex is flat, which was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). UV-Vis spectrum of the polymer/CdTe complex shows that the absorbance increases with the increase of the number of deposition cycles. In the same way, PPV/PSS/PPV/CdTe multilayer were fabricated on the surface of ITO substrate disposed by the poly(3, 4 - ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). The resultant polymer/ CdTe complex is measured under AM 1. 5 G simulated solar illumination with 100 mW·cm- 2 in air.

40|$|In this work, {{we use the}} time-resolved {{microwave}} conductivity (TRMC) {{technique to}} study the dynamics of charge carrier generation in sequentially deposited <b>conjugated</b> polymer/fullerene <b>layers.</b> These layers are either fully solution-processed, using orthogonal solvents for the layers of the polymer poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) and the fullerene phenyl-C₆₁-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), or prepared by thermally evaporating a C₆₀ layer onto P 3 HT films. Our work is motivated by the remarkable efficiency of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices using a sequentially processed P 3 HT/PCBM active layer. Here we use an electrodeless photoconductivity probe, so we can photoexcite the sample either through the polymer or the fullerene layer. We use samples with extremely thick P 3 HT films (2. 4 μm) and show that excitation from either side of both as-cast and thermally annealed sample yields virtually identical results, consistent with mixing of the PCBM into the polymer film. We also compare solution-deposited samples to samples made by thermally evaporating C₆₀ on P 3 HT, and find that we can distinguish between charge generation in bulk-P 3 HT and at the polymer/fullerene interface. We show that, despite their morphological differences, the carrier dynamics in the sequentially processed samples resemble those of mixed, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) systems. All of {{this is consistent with}} the idea that PCBM readily mixes into the P 3 HT film in sequentially deposited P 3 HT/PCBM samples, although the total amount of fullerene mixed into the P 3 HT appears to be less than that typically used in an optimized BHJ. Finally, we discuss the implications for OPV device architectures prepared by sequential deposition from solution. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{introduce}} a solution-processed CdS interlayer {{for use in}} inverted bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, and compare this material {{to a series of}} standard organic and inorganic cathode interlayers. Different combinations of solution-processed CdS, ZnO and <b>conjugated</b> polyelectrolyte (CPE) <b>layers</b> were compared as cathode interlayers on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates to construct inverted solar cells based on poly[[4, 8 -bis[(2 -ethylhexyl) oxy]benzo[1, 2 -b: 4, 5 -b′]dithiophene- 2, 6 -diyl][3 -fluoro- 2 -[(2 -ethylhexyl) carbonyl]thieno[3, 4 -b]thiophenediyl]]:[6, 6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl-ester (PTB 7 :PC 71 BM) and a poly(3 -hexylthiophene) :[6, 6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (P 3 HT:PC 61 BM) as photoactive layers. Introduction of a CdS interlayer significantly improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted PTB 7 :PC 71 BM devices from 2. 0 % to 4. 9 %, however, this efficiency was still fairly low compared to benchmark ZnO or CPE interlayers due to a low open circuit voltage (VOC). The VOC was greatly improved by introducing a <b>conjugated</b> polyelectrolyte (CPE) <b>layer</b> on top of the CdS layer, yielding outstanding diode characteristics and a PCE of 6. 8 %. These results indicate that the deep conduction band energy of CdS limits the VOC possible when used as an ETL in polymer fullerene solar cells, however, we have discovered that this issue can be readily overcome via the incorporation of an organic interfacial dipole layer. The best performing interlayer, however, was a single CPE layer alone, which yielded a VOC of 0. 727 V, a FF of 63. 2 %, and a PCE of 7. 89 %. Using P 3 HT:PC 61 BM as an active layer, similar trends were observed. Solar cells without the cathode interlayer yielded a PCE of 0. 46 % with a poor VOC of 0. 197 V and FF of 34. 3 %. In contrast, the use of inorganic/organic ZnO/CPE interlayers as the cathode interlayer considerably improved the VOC of 0. 599 V and FF of 53. 3 %, resulting in a PCE of 2. 99 %. Our results indicate that the CdS layer yields excellent diode characteristics, however, performs slightly worse than benchmark ZnO and CPE layers in solar cell devices due to parasitic absorption below 550 nm. These results suggest that layered inorganic/organic interfacial materials are promising candidates as cathode interlayers for high efficiency inverted solar cells through the modification of interfacial contacts. clos...|$|R
40|$|A reverse enzyme {{immunoassay}} (R-EIA) is described, in which polystyrene muplates are sensitized with anti-immunoglobulin M (IgM) (mu chain) antibodies and then sequentially allowed to react with patient's serum, peroxidase-labeled Toxoplasma gondii soluble antigen, and substrate. Measurement of {{activity of the}} solid-phase bound enzyme conjugate was done by colorimetric reading of the final developed color and kinetically by the initial rate of color development. This R-EIA allowed full resolution between absorbance values {{of a group of}} 36 sera which presented positive results in the Toxoplasma IgM immunofluorescence test and the remaining groups, which consisted of 39 normal individuals, 22 rheumatoid factor-positive sera, 8 Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemic sera, 3 infectious mononucleosis samples, and 6 high-titered IgG anti-T. gondii sera. No interference of rheumatoid factor IgM or inhibition by high-titered specific IgG was detected, even in the false IgM immunofluorescence-positive rheumatoid factor samples. Likewise, false-negative IgM immunofluorescence samples gave positive R-EIA even without adsorption with Staphylococcus aureus protein A. The possibility of direct tagging of the antigen with the enzyme eliminates the need for using antigen and anti-antigen <b>conjugates</b> as separate <b>layers,</b> therefore eliminating one step in the assay...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of mixed}} ligand layers {{including}} poly(ethylene glycol) -based ligands for the functionalization of nanoparticles {{is a very}} popular strategy {{in the context of}} nanomedicine. However, it is challenging to control the composition of the ligand layer and maintain high colloidal and chemical stability of the conjugates. A high level of control and stability are crucial for reproducibility, upscaling, and safe application. In this study, gold nanoparticles with well-defined mixed ligand layers of α-methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) -ω-(11 -mercaptoundecanoate) (PEGMUA) and 11 -mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) were synthesized and characterized by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis. The colloidal and chemical stability of the conjugates was tested by dynamic light scattering (DLS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and UV/vis spectroscopy based experiments, and their interactions with cells were analyzed by elemental analysis. We demonstrate that the alkylene spacer in PEGMUA is the key feature for the controlled synthesis of mixed <b>layer</b> <b>conjugates</b> with very high colloidal and chemical stability and that a controlled synthesis is not possible using regular PEG ligands without the alkylene spacer. With the results of our stability tests, the molecular structure of the ligands can be clearly linked to the colloidal and chemical stabilization. We expect that the underlying design principle can be generalized to improve the level of control in nanoparticle surface chemistry...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{research}} on organic solar cells {{has gone through}} an important development stage leading to major enhancements in power conversion efficiency, from 4 % to 9 % in single-junction devices. During this period, there are many novel processing techniques and device designs that have been proposed and adapted in organic solar-cell devices. One well-known device architecture that helps maximize the solar cell efficiency is the multi-junction tandem solar-cell design. Given this design, multiple photoactive absorbers as subcells are stacked in a monolithic fashion and assembled via series connection into one complete device, known as the tandem solar cell. Since multiple absorbers with different optical energy bandgaps are being applied in one tandem solar-cell device, the corresponding solar cell efficiency is maximized through expanded absorption spectrum and reduced carrier thermalization loss. In Chapter 3, the architecture of solution-processible, visibly transparent solar cells is introduced. Unlike conventional organic solar-cell devices with opaque electrodes (such as silver, aluminum, gold and etc.), the semi-transparent solar cells rely on highly transparent electrodes and visibly transparent photoactive absorbers. Given these two criteria, we first demonstrated the visibly transparent single-junction solar cells via the polymer absorber with near-infrared absorption and the top electrode based on solution-processible silver nanowire conductor. The highest visible transparency (400 ~ 700 nm) of 65 % was achieved for the complete device structure. More importantly, power conversion efficiency of 4 % was also demonstrated. In Chapter 4, we stacked two semi-transparent photoactive absorbers in the tandem architecture in order to realize the semi-transparent tandem solar cells. A noticeable performance improvement from 4 % to 7 % was observed. More importantly, we modified the interconnecting layers with the incorporation of a thin <b>conjugated</b> polyelectrolyte <b>layer</b> functioning as the surface dipole formation layer to provide better electrical contact with the photoactive layer. Due {{to the effectiveness of}} the <b>conjugated</b> polyelectrolyte <b>layer,</b> performance improvement was also observed. Furthermore, other issues regarding the semi-transparent tandem solar cells (e. g., photocurrent matching, exterior color tuning, and transparency tuning) are all explored to optimize best performance. In Chapter 5 and 6, the architectures of double- and triple-junction tandem solar cells are explored. Theoretically, triple-junction tandem solar cells with three photoactive absorbers with cascaded energy bandgaps have the potential to achieve higher performance, in comparison with double-junction tandem solar cells. Such expectations can be ascribed to the minimized carrier thermalization loss and further improved light absorption. However, the design of triple-junction solar cells often involves sophisticated multiple layer deposition as well as substantial optimization. Therefore, {{there is a lack of}} successful demonstrations of triple-junction solar cells outperforming the double-junction counterparts. To solve the incompatible issues related to the layer deposition in the fabrication, we proposed a novel architecture of inverted-structure tandem solar cells with newly designed interconnecting layers. Our design of interconnecting layers does not only focus on maintaining the orthogonal solution processing advantages, but also provides an excellent compatibility in the energy level alignment to allow different absorber materials to be used. Furthermore, we also explored the light management inside the double- and triple-junction tandem solar cells. The study of light management was carried out through optical simulation method based transfer matrix formalism. The intention is to obtain a balanced photocurrent output from each subcells inside the tandem solar cell, thus the minimal recombination loss at the contact of interconnecting layers and the optimal efficiency can be expected. With help from simulations, we were able to calibrate the thickness of each photoactive layer as well as the thickness of interconnecting layers to achieve the optimized processing conditions. With the highest power conversion efficiency, 11. 5 %, triple-junction tandem solar cells outperform the double-junction tandem solar cells at 10. 5 %. In summary, this dissertation has provided practical solutions to the current demand of high-performance and easily manufactured organic solar cells from the solar cell industry. Particularly, triple-junction tandem solar cells with efficiencies over 11 % should have great potential to contribute to high-efficiency solar-cell applications, whereas semi-transparent tandem solar cells with efficiency at 7 % should be applicable to building-integrated applications...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} in situ STM study on submonolayer Sb {{electrodeposition}} on Au(1 1 1). Different approaches have been employed to study Sb irreversible adsorption, the redox {{behavior of the}} Sb(III) adspecies with and without the influence of UPD and vice versa. The oxygenous Sb(III) is adsorb on Au(1 1 1) surface at potentials between 0. 2 and 0. 55 V, which is very likely {{in the form of}} in-plane oriented SbO+ <b>layer</b> <b>conjugated</b> with the sulfate. In the solutions containing only sulfuric acid, this anion bound film undergoes a subtle structural change after the completion of discharge from Sb(III) to Sb(O) state at similar to 0 V In the Sb(III) containing solutions, the film type of structure of the adspecies is destroyed at the potential where Sb UPD takes place and more Sb can be incorporated, leading to structural transition to a worm-like network. Alloys at least involving two top layers of the surface are formed accompanying the structural transition. The Sb UPD without precedent with the irreversible adsorption proceeds by forming monoatomic high alloy islands of similar to 10 mm in diameter. The apparent simple surface morphology provides evidence con that the channels within the complex worm-like network may well be a result of oxygen removal from the in-plane orientated SbO+ layer and alloy formation as well.

However, progress in this field has been slowed, since achieving high DNA density functionalization on the nanoparticle surface for materials other than gold is a major challenge. In this body of work, we have developed a general system to <b>conjugate</b> a dense <b>layer</b> of DNA {{on the surface}} of nanoparticles by the self-assembly of DNA block copolymer. These hybrid nanostructures demonstrated enhanced DNA binding, where the DNA strands {{on the surface of the}} nanoparticles can recognize and bind to complementary DNA strands without the addition of salt, a condition where free DNA strands do not form duplex. These assemblies are also selective in DNA recognition; they can distinguish different number base mismatches of the complementary DNA. It was determined that these assemblies possess a surface DNA density that is four times higher than that of DNA-conjugated gold nanoparticles of the same size, the highest DNA functionalization reported in the literature in this size range. These assemblies were also effectively taken up by cells without the use of a co-transfecting agent. The high DNA density also protects the degradation o...|$|R
