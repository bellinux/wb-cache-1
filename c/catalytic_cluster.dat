40|$|Biological {{electron}} transfer {{is designed to}} connect <b>catalytic</b> <b>clusters</b> by chains of redox cofactors. A review of the characterized natural redox proteins with a critical eye for molecular scale measurement of variation and selection related to physiological function shows {{no statistically significant differences}} in the protein medium lying between cofactors engaged in physiologically beneficial or detrimental {{electron transfer}}. Instead, control of electron tunnelling over long distances relies overwhelmingly on less than 14  Å spacing between the cofactors in a chain. Near <b>catalytic</b> <b>clusters,</b> shorter distances (commonly less than 7  Å) appear to be selected to generate tunnelling frequencies sufficiently high to scale the barriers of multi-electron, bond-forming/-breaking catalysis at physiological rates. We illustrate this behaviour in a tunnelling network analysis of cytochrome c oxidase. In order to surmount the large, thermally activated, adiabatic barriers in the 5 – 10  kcal mol− 1 range expected for H+ motion and O 2 reduction at the binuclear centre of oxidase on the 103 – 105  s− 1 time-scale of respiration, electron access with a tunnelling frequency of 109 or 1010  s− 1 is required. This is provided by selecting closely placed redox centres, such as haem a (6. 9  Å) or tyrosine (4. 9  Å). A corollary is that more distantly placed redox centres, such as CuA, cannot rapidly scale the catalytic site barrier, but must send their electrons through more closely placed centres, avoiding direct short circuits that might circumvent proton pumping coupled to haems a to a 3 electron transfer. The selection of distances and energetic barriers directs electron transfer from CuA to haem a rather than a 3, without any need for delicate engineering of the protein medium to ‘hard wire’ electron transfer. Indeed, an examination {{of a large number of}} oxidoreductases provides no evidence of such naturally selected wiring of electron tunnelling pathways...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSulfur {{is present}} in several nucleosides within tRNAs. In particular, thiolation of the universally conserved methyl-uridine at {{position}} 54 stabilizes tRNAs from thermophilic bacteria and hyperthermophilic archaea and is required for growth at high temperature. The simple nonredox substitution of the C 2 -uridine carbonyl oxygen by sulfur is catalyzed by tRNA thiouridine synthetases called TtuA. Spectroscopic, enzymatic, and structural studies indicate that TtuA carries a catalytically essential [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster and requires ATP for activity. A series of crystal structures shows that (i) the cluster is ligated by only three cysteines that are fully conserved, allowing the fourth unique iron to bind a small ligand, such as exogenous sulfide, and (ii) the ATP binding site, localized thanks to a protein-bound AMP molecule, a reaction product, is adjacent to the cluster.

In the present work, we explored methods of achieving such a transformation through a density-functional-based study. Au- 20 is known {{be one of}} the most stable and catalytically inert gold clusters, with a well-known tetrahedral structure. We demonstrate the {{transformation of}} the inert Au- 20 conformation into a highly active <b>catalytic</b> <b>cluster</b> through selective doping with Hf and Ge atoms. Depending on the dopant, the inert tetrahedral Au- 20 cluster evolves into either an endohedral or a hollow-cage-like conformation. The structural changes are manifested in the catalytic properties as well, with the result that the transformed doped cages exhibit extremely low activation barriers for the environmentally important CO oxidation reaction as compared to reported inert Au- 20 cluster. The activation barriers for CO oxidation are particularly low (< 0. 12 eV) when germanium is directly involved in the CO oxidation. Thus, the current work highlights the importance of engineering structural properties of metal nanoclusters with the help of heteroatom dopants for future applications in efficient catalysis...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the four}} photo-driven {{transitions}} of the water-oxidizing tetramanganese-calcium cofactor of biological photosynthesis, the second-last {{step of the}} catalytic cycle, that is the S 2 to S 3 state transition, is the crucial step that poises the catalyst for the final O-O bond formation. This transition, whose intermediates are not yet fully understood, is a multi-step process that involves the redox-active tyrosine residue and includes oxidation and deprotonation of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>cluster,</b> {{as well as the}} binding of a water molecule. Spectroscopic data has the potential to shed light on the sequence of events that comprise this catalytic step, which still lacks a structural interpretation. In this work the S 2 -S 3 state transition is studied and a key intermediate species is characterized: it contains a Mn 3 O 4 Ca cubane subunit linked to a five-coordinate Mn(iv) ion that adopts an approximately trigonal bipyramidal ligand field. It is shown using high-level density functional and multireference wave function calculations that this species accounts for the near-infrared absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance observations on metastable S 2 -S 3 intermediates. The results confirm that deprotonation and Mn oxidation of the cofactor must precede the coordination of a water molecule, and lead to identification of a novel low-energy water binding mode that has important implications for the identity of the substrates in the mechanism of biological water oxidation...|$|E
40|$|The latest {{process for}} {{producing}} {{large quantities of}} single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) {{to emerge from the}} Rice University, dubbed HiPco, is living up to its promise. The current production rates approach 450 mg/h (or 10 g/day), and nanotubes typically have no more than 7 mol % of iron impurities. Second-generation HiPco apparatus can run continuously for 7 - 10 days at a time. In the HiPco process nanotubes grow in high-pressure, high-temperature flowing CO on <b>catalytic</b> <b>clusters</b> of iron. Catalyst is formed in situ by thermal decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl, which is delivered intact within a cold CO flow and then rapidly mixed with hot CO in the reaction zone. Upon heating, the Fe(CO) 5 decomposes into atoms that condense into larger clusters. SWNTs nucleate and grow on these particles in the gas phase via CO disproportionation: CO + CO [...] > CO 2 + C (SWNT), catalyzed by the Fe surface. The concentration of CO 2 produced in this reaction is equal to that of carbon and can therefore serve as a useful real-time feedback parameter. It was used to study and optimize SWNT production as a function of temperature, pressure, and Fe(CO) 5 concentration. The results of the parametric study are in agreement with current understanding of the nanotube formation mechanism...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPsbP and PsbQ {{proteins}} are extrinsic subunits of photosystem II (PSII) and {{optimize the}} oxygen evolution reaction by regulating the binding {{properties of the}} essential cofactors Ca 2 + and Cl−. PsbP induces conformational changes around the <b>catalytic</b> Mn <b>cluster</b> required for Ca 2 + and Cl− retention, and the N-terminal region of PsbP is essential for this reaction. It was reported that PsbQ partially restores the functional defect of N-terminal truncated PsbP [Ifuku and Sato (2002) Plant Cell Physiol. 43, 1244 – 1249]; however, the mechanism of this restoration {{is yet to be}} clarified. In this study, we demonstrate that PsbQ is able to restore the functional binding of mutated PsbPs. In the presence of PsbQ, ∆ 15 -PsbP, a truncated PsbP lacking 15 N-terminal residues, was able to specifically bind to NaCl-washed spinach PSII membranes and significantly restore the oxygen evolving activity. Furthermore, PsbQ was also able to compensate for the impaired ion-retention of H 144 A-PsbP, in which a conserved histidine at position 144 in the C-terminal domain was substituted with an alanine. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy showed that PsbQ restored the ability of ∆ 15 - and H 144 A-PsbP to induce proper conformational changes during S 1 to S 2 transition. These data suggest that the major function of PsbQ is to stabilize PsbP binding, thereby contributing to the maintenance of the <b>catalytic</b> Mn <b>cluster</b> of the water oxidation machinery in higher plant PSII.

40|$|Density {{functional}} theory based global geometry optimization {{has been}} used to demonstrate the crucial influence of the geometry of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>cluster</b> on the energy barriers for the CO oxidation reaction over Pd-based bimetallic nanoalloys. We show that dramatic geometry change between the reaction intermediates can lead to very high energy barriers and thus be prohibitive for the whole process. This introduces challenges for both the design of new catalysts, and theoretical methods employed. On the theory side, a careful choice of geometric configurations of all reaction intermediates is crucial for an adequate description of a possible reaction path. From {{the point of view of}} the catalyst design, the cluster geometry can be controlled by adjusting the level of interaction between the cluster and the dopant metal, as well as between the adsorbate molecules and the catalyst cluster by mixing different metals in a single nanoalloy particle. We show that substitution of a Pd atom in the Pd$_{ 5 }$ cluster with a single Ag atom to form Pd$_{ 4 }$Ag$_{ 1 }$ leads to a potential improvement of the catalytic properties of the cluster for the CO oxidation reaction. On the other hand, a single Au atom does not enhance the properties of the catalyst, which is attributed to a weaker hybridization between the cluster's constituent metals and the adsorbate molecules. Such flexibility of properties of bimetallic nanoalloy clusters illustrates the possibility of fine-tuning, which might be used for design of novel efficient catalytic materials.

40|$|International audienceLow-field helicon {{radiofrequency}} plasmas at {{low pressure}} can generate large ion fluxes {{which can be}} used in a variety of processes (direct or assisted reactive sputtering, carbon nanofibre growth, <b>catalytic</b> <b>cluster</b> deposition). Applications include plasma-induced crystallisation of TiO 2 thin films 1, enhanced catalytic activity of hydrogen fuel cell electrodes 2 and ion beam formation for electrode-less plasma thrusters 3. Large ion densities (over 7 x 1016 m- 3) lead to the formation of nanocrystalline (~ 15 nm) rutile phase TiO 2. The post-annealing treatment of the films in air at 300 °C induces the complete crystallization of the amorphous films to nanocrystals of anatase (~ 40 nm) while the rutile films shows no significant change meaning that they are already fully crystallized by the plasma process. Low temperature processes combining the growth of carbon nanofibres in CH 4 /H 2 plasmas subsequently coated with 4 nm size platinum nanoclusters improve hydrogen fuel cell efficiency for constant catalytic loading. More recently, efficient fuel cell electrodes containing monoatomic, bimetallic and trimetallic Pt-based nanoclusters have been synthesized by magnetron co-deposition and a gas-condensation technique. Finally, large area high velocity ion beams can also be generated in helicon plasmas using an extended range of operating gases.

40|$|Along with Mn, {{calcium and}} {{chloride}} ions are necessary cofactors for oxygen evolution in Photosystem II (PS II). To further test and verify whether Ca {{is close to}} the Mn cluster, the authors substituted strontium for Ca and probed from the Sr point of view for any nearby Mn. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) of Sr-reactivated PS II indicates major differences between the intact and NH{sub 2 }OH-treated samples. In intact samples, the Fourier transform of the Sr EXAFS shows a Fourier peak that is missing in inactive samples. This peak II is best simulated by two Mn neighbors at a distance of 3. 5 Angstrom, confirming the proximity of Ca (Sr) cofactor to the Mn cluster. In addition, polarized Sr EXAFS on oriented Sr-reactivated samples shows this peak II is dichroic: large magnitude at 10 degrees (angle between the PS II membrane normal and the x-ray electric field vector) and small at 80 degrees. Analysis of the dichroism yields the relative angle between the Sr-Mn vector and membrane normal (23 degrees {+-} 4 degrees), and the isotropic coordination number for these layered samples. X-ray absorption spectroscopy has also been employed to assess the degree of similarity between the manganese cluster in PS II and a family of synthetic manganese complexes containing the distorted cubane [Mn{sub 4 }O{sub 3 }X] core (X = benzoate, acetate, methoxide, hydroxide, azide, fluoride, chloride or bromide). In addition, Mn{sub 4 }O{sub 3 }Cl complexes containing three or six terminal Cl ligands at three of the Mn were included in this study.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Statistical {{mechanics}} and transition state (TS) theory describe rates and selectivities of C−C bond cleavage in C 2 −C 10 n-alkanes on metal catalysts {{and provide a}} general description for the hydrogenolysis of hydrocarbons. Mecha-nistic interpretation shows the dominant role of entropy, over enthalpy, in determining the location and rate of C−C bond cleavage. Ir, Rh, and Pt clusters cleave C−C bonds at rates proportional to coverages of intermediates derived by removing 3 − 4 H-atoms from n-alkanes. Rate constants for C−C cleavage reflect large activation enthalpies (ΔH⧧, 217 − 257 kJ mol− 1) that are independent of chain length and C−C bond location in C 4 + n-alkanes. C−C bonds cleave because of large, positive activation entropies (ΔS⧧, 164 − 259 J mol− 1 K− 1) provided by H 2 that forms with TS. Kinetic and independent spectroscopic evidence for the composition and structure of these TS give accurate estimates of ΔS ⧧ for cleavage at each C−C bond. Large differences between rate constants for ethane and n-decane (∼ 108) reflect {{an increase in the}} entropy of gaseous alkanes retained at the TS. The location of C−C bond cleavage depends solely on the rotational entropies of alkyl chains attached to the cleaved C−C bond, which depend on their chain length. Such entropy considerations account for the ubiquitous, but previously unexplained, preference for cleaving nonterminal C−C bonds in n-alkanes. This mechanistic analysis and thermodynamic treatment illustrates the continued utility of such approaches even for hydrogenolysis reactions, with complexity seemingly beyond the reach of classical treatments, and applies to <b>catalytic</b> <b>clusters</b> beyond those reported here (0. 6 − 2. 7 nm; Ir, Rh, Pt). 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{principles}} of natures own light-driven water splitting catalyst, Photosystem II (PSII), {{can in the}} future inspire us to use water as electron and proton source to generate light-driven H 2 production. To mimic this challenging step, {{it is important to}} understand how the enzyme system can oxidize water. The mechanism of light-driven water oxidation in PSII is in this thesis addressed by EPR spectroscopy. P 680 + is a strong oxidant formed by light-oxidation of the chlorophyll species P 680 positioned in the center of PSII. The redox active tyrosine-Z (YZ) can reduce P 680 + and the YZ• radical is formed. This transient radical is further reduced by the CaMn 4 -cluster, which is the binding site of the substrate water molecules. In a cyclic process called the S-cycle, this <b>catalytic</b> <b>cluster</b> accumulates four oxidizing equivalents to evolve one molecule of O 2 and to oxidize two molecules of water. We can induce the YZ• radical at cryogenic temperatures in the different oxidation states of the catalytic S-cycle and observe this in metalloradical EPR signals. These metalloradical EPR signals are here characterized and used to deduce mechanistic information from the intact PSII. The "double nature" of these spin-spin interaction signals, so called split EPR signals, makes them excellent probes to both YZ oxidation and, when YZ• is present, also to the S-states of the CaMn 4 -cluster. The metalloradical EPR signals presented here, form a way to study the transient YZ• radical in active PSII that has not been depleted of the catalytic metal cluster. This depleting method that has often been used in the past to study YZ is not representing studies of a mechanistically relevant material. The previously suggested disorder around YZ and accessibility to the bulk can be artifactual properties induced in the mechanistically defect PSII. On the contrary, our observation that proton coupled electron transfer from YZ to the light induced P 680 + can occur in a high yield at cryogenic temperatures, suggests a well ordered catalytic site in the protein positioned for optimal performance. The optimized positioning of the redox components found in PSII might be a feature also important to build in an efficient water oxidizing catalyst...|$|E

Thermal evaporation, laser ablation, chemical vapor deposition and other synthetic routes have enabled the synthesis of inorganic nanoscale materials with various morphologies. These nanomaterials form the building blocks for a range of uses such as nanoscale devices, energy storage, sensors and nanomedicine. Physical evaporation synthetic route plays a key role in inorganic nanomaterial growth. In this approach, materials are first evaporated and then condensed to form solid materials. Thermal evaporation is one of the widely used methods; it is a simple and an effective way for the synthesis of nanostructures during the last decade. This method is usually processed in a tube furnace, in which the source materials are vaporized at an elevated temperature and the vapour phase(s) condense(s) under certain conditions. Since tube furnace is used as heating element, it is not applicable for the source materials with low volatility or high melting point (3 ̆e 1800 ℃), and if the temperature gradient is low (approximately 20 °C/cm) even in a multi-zone tube furnace, which is the driving force for atom movement in most cases. A laser ablation method was developed by using a pulsed laser as secondary heating element; the target materials were ablated by the laser beam, creating a dense, hot vapor of plasma species. In the case of growing nanowires - the hot vapor condenses into nanometer diameter <b>catalytic</b> <b>cluster</b> as the species cool through collisions with the buffer gas. The clusters define the size and direct the growth of the crystalline nanowires by a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. This method ablate target materials with high melting point into gas phase, but the temperature gradient for the nanomaterial growth mainly depends on the tube furnace, it has been successfully applied on the nanowires growth of C, Si and Ge. The objective of this work was to study the nanocrystal growth of ZnO with high crystallinity and clean surface by a new physical evaporation method. This method based on the utilization of high temperature yield by focused light beam and the large temperature gradient formed in the growth chamber. The starting material can be pure material or a mixture with catalyst materials in a crucible free condition. The work in this thesis is directed to the growth study and characterization of nanosized ZnO. ZnO nancrystal and nanostructure with various morphologies have been successfully grown by this new method. A systematic and detailed growth study has been carried out, relating to the influence of growth conditions on the morphology and phase structure of the synthesized product(s). The physical properties of selected samples with typical morphologies were studied. The growth mechanisms of ZnO nanocrystals by this method have also been investigated. This new method has shown some unique features and could be adapted for growing nanocrystals and nanostructures of other materials, particularly for the materials that can absorb infrared easily.

40|$|SWNTs. In {{the former}} method, carbon atoms and {{catalytic}} metal atoms are vaporized {{at the same}} time by the intense laser ablation. In the later, the <b>catalytic</b> metal <b>clusters</b> are present before the assembly of carbon atoms. Hence, 2 different simulation conditions, `co-vaporization' and `CCVD' are compared below. Generation conditions of SWNTs by the laser-furnace or by the arc discharge techniques are almost the same as for fullerene and endohedral metallofullerene except for the doped metal species. Hence, the same molecular dynamics simulation condition as for our previous empty fullerene [8, 9] and for endohedral metallofullerene [10] except for the catalytic Ni atoms was employed. As the initial condition, the completely random vapor mixture of 2500 carbon and 25 Ni atoms were allocated in a 58. 5 nm cubic fully-periodic simulation cell [11, 12]. After 6 ns molecular dynamics calculation, many relatively large clusters up to about 200 carbon atoms and a few metal atoms were observed...|$|R
40|$|The radical S -adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme HydG lyses free L-tyrosine {{to produce}} CO and CN − for the {{assembly}} of the <b>catalytic</b> H <b>cluster</b> of FeFe hydrogenase. We used electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to detect and characterize HydG reaction intermediates generated {{with a set of}} 2 H, 13 C, and 15 N nuclear spin-labeled tyrosine substrates. We propose a detailed reaction mechanism in which the radical SAM reaction, initiated at an N-terminal 4 Fe- 4 S cluster, generates a tyrosine radical bound to a C-terminal 4 Fe- 4 S cluster. Heterolytic cleavage of this tyrosine radical at the C α -C β bond forms a transient 4 -oxidobenzyl (4 OB •) radical and a dehydroglycine bound to the C-terminal 4 Fe- 4 S cluster. Electron and proton transfer to this 4 OB • radical forms p -cresol, with the conversion of this dehydroglycine ligand to Fe-bound CO and CN −, a key intermediate in {{the assembly of}} the 2 Fe subunit of the H cluster...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe water-oxidizing {{complex of}} Photosystem II is an {{important}} target of ultraviolet-B (280 – 320  nm) radiation, but the mechanistic background of the UV-B induced damage is not well understood. Here we studied the UV-B sensitivity of Photosystem II in different oxidation states, called S-states of the water-oxidizing complex. Photosystem II centers of isolated spinach thylakoids were synchronized to different distributions of the S 0, S 1, S 2 and S 3 states by using packages of visible light flashes and were exposed to UV-B flashes from an excimer laser (λ= 308  nm). The loss of oxygen evolving activity showed that the extent of UV-B damage is S-state-dependent. Analysis of the data obtained from different synchronizing flash protocols indicated that the UV-sensitivity of Photosystem II is significantly higher in the S 3 and S 2 states than in the S 1 and S 0 states. The data are {{discussed in terms of}} a model where UV-B-induced inhibition of water oxidation is caused either by direct absorption within the <b>catalytic</b> manganese <b>cluster</b> or by damaging intermediates of the water oxidation process...|$|R
40|$|Protein kinases phosphorylating Ser/Thr/Tyr {{residues}} {{in several}} cellular proteins exert tight {{control over their}} biological functions. They constitute the largest protein family in most eukaryotic species. Protein kinases classified based on sequence similarity in their <b>catalytic</b> domains, <b>cluster</b> into subfamilies, which share gross functional properties. Many protein kinases are associated or tethered covalently to domains that serve as adapter or regulatory modules,naiding substrate recruitment, specificity, and also serve as scaffolds. Hence the modular organisation of the protein kinases serves as guidelines to their functional and molecular properties. Analysis of genomic repertoires of protein kinases in eukaryotes have revealed wide spectrum of domain organisation across various subfamilies of kinases. Occurrence of organism-specific novel domain combinations suggests functional diversity achieved by protein kinases in order to regulate variety of biological processes. In addition, domain architecture of protein kinases revealed existence of hybrid protein kinase subfamilies and their emerging roles in the signaling of eukaryotic organisms. In this review we discuss the repertoire of non-kinase domains tethered to multi-domain kinases in the metazoans. Similarities and differences in the domain architectures of protein kinases in these organisms indicate conserved and unique features that are critical to functional specialization.

40|$|PsbP and PsbQ {{proteins}} are extrinsic subunits of photosystem II (PSII) {{and participate}} in the normal function of photosynthetic water oxidation. Both proteins exist in a broad range of the oxygenic photosynthetic organisms; however, their physiological roles in vivo have not been well defined in higher plants. In this study, we established and analyzed transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants in which the levels of PsbP or PsbQ were severely down-regulated by the RNA interference technique. A plant that lacked PsbQ showed no specific phenotype compared to a wild-type plant. This suggests that PsbQ in higher plants is dispensable under the normal growth condition. On the other hand, a plant that lacked PsbP showed prominent phenotypes: drastic retardation of growth, pale-green-colored leaves, and a marked decrease in the quantum yield of PSII evaluated by chlorophyll fluorescence. In PsbP-deficient plant, most PSII core subunits were accumulated in thylakoids, whereas PsbQ, which requires PsbP to bind PSII in vitro, was dramatically decreased. PSII without PsbP was hypersensitive to light and rapidly inactivated when the repair process of the damaged PSII was inhibited by chloramphenicol. Furthermore, thermoluminescence studies showed that the <b>catalytic</b> manganese <b>cluster</b> in PsbP-deficient leaves was markedly unstable and readily disassembled in the dark. The present results demonstrated that PsbP, but not PsbQ, is indispensable for the normal PSII function in higher plants in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Mechanistic {{investigations}} of the water-split-ting reaction of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII) are fundamentally informed by structural studies. Many physical techniques have provided important insights into the OEC structure and function, including X-ray diffraction (XRD) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy as well as mass spectrometry (MS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spec-troscopy applied in conjunction with mutagenesis studies. However, experimental studies have yet to yield consensus as to the exact configuration of the <b>catalytic</b> metal <b>cluster</b> and its ligation scheme. Computational modeling studies, including density functional (DFT) theory combined with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) hybrid methods for explicitly including {{the influence of the}} surrounding protein, have proposed chemically satisfactory models of the fully ligated OEC within PSII that are maximally consistent with experimental results. The inor-ganic core of these models is similar to the crystallographic model upon which they were based, but comprises important modifications due to structural refinement, hydration, and proteinaceous ligation which improve agreement {{with a wide range of}} experimental data. The computational models are useful for rationalizing spectro-scopic and crystallographic results and for building a complete structure-based mechanism of water-splitting in PSII as described by the intermediate oxidation states of the OEC. This review summarizes these recent advances in QM/MM modeling of PSII within the context of recent experimental studies...|$|R

We surmised that the addition of an additional metal would potentially allow catalytic tailoring with the possibility of an increase in activity. Here a tri-metallic catalytic structure, consisting of <b>clustered</b> <b>catalytic</b> Pt on the surface of a Pd shell supported on a rod shaped Au core was fabricated. The significance of the additional metallic component is shown by comparative electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) analysis results for the trimetallic Aurod-Pdshell-Ptcluster, bimetallic Aurod-Ptcluster and monometallic JM-Pt (used as a reference), which have respective ECSA values (cm 2 /mgPt) of 1883. 0, 1371. 7 and 879.

40|$|This Review article {{discusses}} dendritic organometallic catalysis, {{originating from}} catalytic moieties {{present at the}} peripheries of a dendrimer. The presence of multiple catalytic moieties at the dendrimer peripheries leads to a positive effect in majority of the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, although a negative or a marginal improvement in the catalytic effect {{with respect to the}} corresponding monomeric catalyst were also encountered. A number of recent examples that attempt to rationalize the origin of the dendrimer effect in catalysis are discussed. Further a tabular survey is provided by categorizing the dendritic catalysts and their influence on catalysis. Recent studies on the multivalent dendritic catalysts, wherein varied number of catalytic moieties is installed within a given generation, are utilized to emphasize the role of <b>clustering</b> <b>catalytic</b> moieties at the peripheries of the dendrimers in influencing the catalysis.

40|$|AbstractThe oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) {{of green}} plants accumulates four {{oxidizing}} equivalents to produce molecular oxygen from water. At least two equivalents are stored on the <b>catalytic</b> tetra-manganese <b>cluster.</b> How many and which steps oxidize an amino acid residue instead is under debate. We studied the progression towards higher oxidation states in dark-adapted, chloride-depleted Photosystem II core particles and thylakoids from pea, and monitored from nano- to milliseconds absorption transients from the near-UV into the near-IR spectral regions that directly or by electrochromism reflect the oxidation/reduction {{of the primary}} (P 680, secondary (YZ) and tertiary electron donors (Mn 4 histidine?). When starting from the first oxidation state and with the cofactor Cl− removed, {{we found that the}} OEC stored only two oxidizing equivalents if the cofactor Cl− had been removed. The first equivalent was passed via YZ to an as yet chemically ill-defined component, X, that resembled histidine according to its UV/VIS difference spectrum. The second equivalent was stored on YZ itself. Based on a spectral analysis we propose that the same component X (His?) stores the oxidizing equivalent during the second transition, S 2 ⇒ S 3, in unperturbed material. Our measurements at high time resolution of the concomitant proteolytic reactions led us to propose that during the transition Xred → Xox a proton is ejected into the aqueous phase. We interpret these data in terms of an electrostatic control by Cl− of the midpoint potential of Mn 4 relative to X (His?) and YZ...|$|R

C-H bond activation turnover rates for H 2 O reforming of CH 4 {{increased with decreasing}} Pt cluster size, suggesting that coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms are more reactive than Pt atoms in low-index surfaces prevalent in larger clusters. Near-edge fine structure in X-ray absorption spectra clearly shows electronic changes in Pt clusters relative to bulk Pt crystallites, though differences in the 5 d electronic density among samples with different cluster size could not be related directly to Pt surface atom coordination. These results suggest that <b>catalytic</b> consequences of <b>cluster</b> size arise from surface structure changes leading to coordinative unsaturation of surface atoms.

40|$|Maturation of [FeFe] hydrogenases {{requires}} the biosynthesis and insertion of the <b>catalytic</b> iron-sulfur <b>cluster,</b> the H cluster. Two radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) proteins proposed {{to function in}} H cluster biosynthesis, HydEF and HydG, were recently identified in the hydEF- 1 mutant of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (M. C. Posewitz, P. W. King, S. L. Smolinski, L. Zhang, M. Seibert, and M. L. Ghirardi, J. Biol. Chem. 279 : 25711 - 25720, 2004). Previous efforts to study [FeFe] hydrogenase maturation in Escherichia coli by coexpression of C. reinhardtii HydEF and HydG and the HydA 1 [FeFe] hydrogenase were hindered by instability of the hydEF and hydG expression clones. A more stable [FeFe] hydrogenase expression system has been achieved in E. coli by cloning and coexpression of hydE, hydF, and hydG from the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum. Coexpression of the C. acetobutylicum maturation proteins with various algal and bacterial [FeFe] hydrogenases in E. coli resulted in purified enzymes with specific activities that {{were similar to those}} of the enzymes purified from native sources. In the case of structurally complex [FeFe] hydrogenases, maturation of the catalytic sites could occur in the absence of an accessory iron-sulfur cluster domain. Initial investigations of the structure and function of the maturation proteins HydE, HydF, and HydG showed that the highly conserved radical-SAM domains of both HydE and HydG and the GTPase domain of HydF were essential for achieving biosynthesis of active [FeFe] hydrogenases. Together, these results demonstrate that the catalytic domain and a functionally complete set of Hyd maturation proteins are fundamental to achieving biosynthesis of catalytic [FeFe] hydrogenases...|$|R
