5|$|Pickingill {{was also}} known for his purported ability to <b>control</b> <b>animals,</b> namely horses, and it was {{believed}} that when he struck a hedgerow with his stick, game animals would run out that could then be caught, killed and eaten. It was also rumoured that he could do things faster than ordinary human beings, and that he could do an hour's job in only a few minutes, with some believing that he got his imps—his familiar spirits—to do the job for him. Maple also noted that people who visited his cottage reported seeing ornaments and furniture dancing around the room of their own accord; the folklorist believed that this story had originated in a Dutch folkloric tradition that may have been imported to Essex when many Dutch migrants settled there in the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|Pickingill {{was brought}} to wider public {{attention}} in the early 1960s by the folklorist Eric Maple. As part of his research into beliefs regarding folk magic and witchcraft in nineteenth-century Essex, Maple had interviewed a number of Canewdon residents and collected their stories about Pickingill and {{his reputation as a}} cunning man. According to their accounts, Pickingill attracted visitors from around Essex seeking his magical help, for which he did not charge. They attributed to him the power to <b>control</b> <b>animals,</b> to command imps to do his bidding, and to wield power over either six or nine malevolent witches who lived in Canewdon. It was also claimed {{that he was able to}} coerce assistance and beer from local residents by threatening to place a curse upon them or their belongings. Although it has been suggested that local people were inventing claims to please Maple, many of which were based on older tales regarding the Essex cunning man James Murrell, subsequent research by historian Ronald Hutton has confirmed aspects of the folklorist's original accounts.|$|E

25|$|In the {{diagnosis}} of type I diabetes, elevated anti-sulfatide antibodies in serum arise. Such anti-sulfatide antibodies prevent insulin secretion and exocytosis. However, {{research has shown that}} when non-obese diabetic mice are treated with sulfatide, it reduces the possible occurrence of diabetes from 85% in <b>control</b> <b>animals</b> to 35% in experimental animals. Sulfatide is also commonly known to possess anti-inflammatory properties. As a result of these anti-inflammatory properties, which aid in the blockage of L-selectin, sulfatide has been shown to prevent type I diabetes and inhibit insulitis in non-obese diabetic mice. Sulfatide also prevents apoptosis in insulin secreting cells by preventing the effects of interleukin-1 beta (lL-1β), interferon beta 1b (lFN-1β), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) that promote apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|When rhesus macaques {{were given}} interferon-α2b and {{ribavirin}} and exposed to MERS, they developed less pneumonia than <b>control</b> <b>animals.</b> Five critically ill people with MERS in Saudi Arabia with ARDS and on ventilators were given interferon-α2b and ribavirin but all ended up dying of the disease. The treatment was started late in their disease (a mean of 19 days after hospital admission) {{and they had}} already failed trials of steroids so {{it remains to be}} seen whether it may have benefit earlier in the course of disease. Another proposed therapy is inhibition of viral protease or kinase enzymes. Researchers are investigating a number of ways to combat the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, including using interferon, chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir, as well as other agents such as mycophenolic acid and camostat.|$|E

Scattered around the Northern Kremisphere overworld are the Brothers Bear, a family of bears who provide the players with hints, key items or other services. Players can collect items in levels to trade with the bears for other items or to help progress to later levels; one such item is the Bear Coin, which acts as the game's currency. Other members from the Kong family, such as Cranky Kong, Wrinkly Kong, Swanky Kong and Funky Kong can also be found around the overworld, each of whom offer their own services.|$|E

The NRC noted the major exposure of concern was the groundwater rather than drinking water; the groundwater [...] "seeped into basements" [...] and then led to exposure through air and soil noted several studies {{reported higher levels of}} low-birth weight babies and birth defects among the exposed residents with some evidence the effect subsided after the exposure was eliminated. The National Research Council also noted a study which found exposed children were found to have an [...] "excess of seizures, learning problems, hyperactivity, eye irritation, skin rashes, abdominal pain, and incontinence" [...] and stunted growth. Voles in the area were found to have significantly increased mortality compared to controls (mean life expectancy in exposed animals [...] "23.6 and 29.2 days, respectively, compared to 48.8 days" [...] for <b>control</b> <b>animals).</b> New York State also has an ongoing health study of Love Canal residents.
