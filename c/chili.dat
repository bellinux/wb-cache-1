5|$|At {{the age of}} eighteen, {{he joined}} the Red Hot <b>Chili</b> Peppers, first {{appearing}} on the band's 1989 album, Mother's Milk. The group's follow-up album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), was a breakthrough success. Frusciante became overwhelmed by the band's new popularity and quit in 1992. He became a recluse and entered {{a long period of}} drug addiction, during which he released his first solo recordings: Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt (1994) and Smile from the Streets You Hold (1997). In 1998, he successfully completed drug rehabilitation and rejoined the Red Hot <b>Chili</b> Peppers. Their next album, Californication (1999) would eventually go on to sell 16 million copies.
