In this paper, we propose a high-performance and robust sense-amplifier design using independent gate control in symmetric and asym-metric DG devices for sub- 50 -nm technologies. The proposed sense amplifier has better performance (30 %– 35 % less sensing delay) and robustness (60 %– 80 % less minimum input bit-differential for correct operation considering 10 % worst case silicon thickness mismatch) compared to the <b>connected</b> <b>gate</b> design. Hence, the proposed design successfully demonstrates the benefit of using independent gate control in DG devices for efficient circuit design in sub- 50 -nm regime.

40|$|Low {{conduction}} {{losses are}} one technical advantage of SiC-MOSFETs compared to conventional IGBTs but this benefit {{is generally not}} enough to justify the much higher wafer costs per mm 2. The other very important advantage is the lower switching losses. A conventional power module design with externally <b>connected</b> <b>gate</b> drivers cannot even get into the region of what SiC-MOSFETs are capable to perform. One reason are high parasitic inductances caused by the module design (gate and drain-source inductance) but another reason is the very sensitive gate structure of today's SiC-MOSFETs compared to Si-switches. This abstract reveals the requirements a driver has to fulfil to switch SiC-MOSFETs at their maximum switching speed and shows how it is done in practical applications. Differences in the gate behavior of SiC-MOSFETs and Si-competitors are illustrated. Practical solutions are depicted and evaluated for different applications...|$|R
