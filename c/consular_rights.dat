50|$|Many countries, {{even those}} that permit {{multiple}} citizenship, do not explicitly recognise multiple citizenship under their laws: individuals are treated either as citizens of that country or not, and their citizenship with respect to other countries is considered to have no bearing. This can mean (in Iran, Mexico, many Arab countries, and former Soviet republics) that consular officials abroad may {{not have access to}} their citizens if they also hold local citizenship. Some countries provide access for consular officials as a matter of courtesy, but do not accept any obligation to do so under international <b>consular</b> agreements. The <b>right</b> of countries to act in this fashion is protected via the Master Nationality Rule.|$|R

40|$|Looking {{back at the}} LaGrand {{judgment}} {{some time}} after the decision has been rendered, one cannot help but wonder that a dispute of such limited scope should have prompted the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to address so many issues of general relevance. The most spectacular among these would certainly be the ICJ 2 ̆ 7 s authoritative decision on {{the legal status of}} interim orders under Article 41 of the ICJ Statute, and its recognition that Article 36 (1) (b) of the Vienna Convention on <b>Consular</b> Relations protects <b>rights</b> of the individual. Important as they are, however, it would be unfortunate if these findings overshadowed some of the other, less spectacular, aspects of the decision. One of these is the court 2 ̆ 7 s progressive development of the law of state responsibility In fact, in {{the last part of the}} LaGrand judgment, the court has taken the opportunity to influence, if not direct, the legal rules governing consequences of international wrongs. It has done so by recognizing that a state injured by a breach of international law may be entitled to demand from the breaching state guarantees and assurances that the breach will not be repeated...|$|R
50|$|José Ernesto Medellín appealed his execution, {{saying that}} he had {{informed}} City of Houston and Harris County police officers that he was a Mexican citizen, and that he had been unable to confer with Mexican consular officials. The prosecutors said that Medellín never told authorities that he was a Mexican citizen. Medellín said in a sworn statement that he learned that the Mexican consulate could assist him in 1997. He petitioned the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in 1998 regarding this issue; the appeal failed.Medellín's impending execution became an international controversy, since the state did not hold a hearing about whether the inability for Medellín to meet with Mexican consular officials harmed his defense. The right of a defendant to talk with his or her consulate is specified in the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations; the United States is a party to the convention, although the U.S. withdrew from compulsory jurisdiction in 1986 to accept the court's jurisdiction only on a case-by-case basis. In 2004 the International Court of Justice responded to a lawsuit filed by Mexico against the United States; the court ordered hearings to be held for inmates, including Medellín, who were denied <b>consular</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|E

[...] The Court also ruled that it [...] "cannot however uphold the submission of the Islamic Republic of Iran that those actions constitute a breach of the obligations of the United States of America under Article X, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations, and <b>Consular</b> <b>Rights</b> Between the United States of America and Iran, regarding freedom of commerce between the territories of the parties, and that, accordingly, the claim of the Islamic Republic of Iran for reparation also cannot be upheld;" ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study we have {{examined}} {{the provisions of the}} European legal instrument governing the right of access to a lawyer within the criminal proceedings in a Member State of the European Union, especially in situations where against the person concerned it was imposed a measure of deprivation of liberty and the right to have access to <b>consular</b> authorities, the <b>right</b> to inform a third person and the right of access to a lawyer in execution proceedings of a European Arrest Warrant. With the actual examination of these provisions, we referred also to the provisions of law, emphasizing the differences of the existing regulation and the need to transpose the European legal instrument into the national law by a separate legislative act and not by completing the special law, as it is intended at the moment. The innovations consist of examining the European legal instrument focusing on the right to have access to all the criminal proceedings, with reference to relevant national legislation, including the procedure of executing a European arrest warrant. The paper can be useful to academics, practitioners in the field and to the Romanian legislator from the perspective of transposing this European legal instrument into the national law...|$|R

The author {{analyzes the}} characteristics of self-contained regimes, a concept {{which appeared in the}} theory of international law after the 1980 judgement of the International Court of Justice in the famous case concerning diplomatic and consular staff in Teheran. She examines whether diplomatic and <b>consular</b> law, human <b>rights</b> law and European Community (EC) law match with the theoretical model of self-contained regime, which excludes even residual application of general international law. Special attention is paid to the EC law which developed into efi cacious set of rules, with many specifi c characteristics, supranational elements, being one of them. She concludes that neither of the mentioned subsystems of international law satisfy the criteria of self-contained regime because if the mechanisms provided by the secondary rules of that regime fail, the general international law or another sybsistem of international law become again applicable. In the opinion of the author the existence of self-contained regime is not possible in practice since the rules devoted to a certain subject-matter, as developed as they may be, cannot exist in legal vacuum, isolated from general (international) law...|$|R
40|$|In {{the case}} of LaGrand (Germany v United States), the International Court of Justice held that the United States (US) had {{violated}} its international obligation to Germany under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations when it executed two German nationals without first informing them of their <b>consular</b> <b>rights.</b> The case came before the court after the United States had disregarded a preliminary ruling passed by the IC], which directed the US not to execute the German nationals pending {{the outcome of the}} ICJ case. The decision raised the issue of the effect of ICJ decisions in domestic proceedings and the effectiveness of ICJ enforcement mechanisms. This thesis considers the possibility of a role for national courts as active enforcers of ICJ decisions. It is argued that whilst evidence shows that there is no legal obligation on courts to enforce ICJ decisions, there is certainly room in international law to facilitate this development. In support of this argument, the thesis demonstrates how basic presuppositions about international law have shifted over the last few decades. This shift has been both the impetus and the result of globalisation. The case of LaGrand alongside similar cases is used to show how national courts may play an increased role in the enforcement of ICJ decisions...|$|E
40|$|Oil Platforms was {{a treaty}} case. Although it {{grew out of}} a much deeper dispute, {{involving}} not just the United States but numerous other States, about the military tactics employed during the Iran-Iraq war, and although that dispute revolved around the entitlement of the belligerents under general international law to damage the interests of third States, the ICJ 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction to hear the case brought before it depended on the 1955 bilateral Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations and <b>Consular</b> <b>Rights</b> between Iran and the United States. In the words of Judge Kooijmans, it was 2 ̆ 2 a dispute which originated in the use of force but was brought to the Court as a violation of treaty guaranteed freedom of commerce. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 It followed that, in accordance with the Court 2 ̆ 7 s established jurisprudence, the only substantive disputes on which it was entitled to pronounce were those falling within the jurisdictional clause in that Treaty. In this case (as the Court had already decided in the jurisdictional phase in 1996), that meant a dispute over the interpretation or application of Article X, paragraph 1. As framed in their closing Submissions, Iran claimed that in attacking and destroying the oil platforms the United States breached its obligations to Iran under Article X, paragraph 1. The United States in turn, while rejecting that claim on the merits, counter-claimed under the same provision against Iran 2 ̆ 7 s mine and missile attacks on vessels in the Gulf and other military actions said to be dangerous and detrimental to commerce and navigation...|$|E
