5|$|Auditory camouflage, {{at least}} in the form of noise reduction, is practised in various ways. The {{rubberized}} hull of military submarines absorbs sonar waves and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of auditory camouflage. Some modern helicopters are designed to be quiet. Combat uniforms are usually equipped with buttons rather than snap fasteners or velcro to reduce noise.|$|E
5|$|Spirals {{are common}} in plants and in some animals, notably molluscs. For example, in the nautilus, a {{cephalopod}} mollusc, each chamber of its shell is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor and arranged in a logarithmic spiral. Given a modern understanding of fractals, a growth spiral <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> special case of self-similarity.|$|E

David Kawalko Roselli writes that although Goldhill's perspective is valuable, he does not sufficiently consider the theatre's ritual purpose. If women did attend the theatre, they may have sat separately from the men.|$|E
5|$|At the {{headland}} at Grenen, {{the northernmost}} point of Denmark, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea meet. Because of their different densities, a clear dividing line <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of turbulent seas, beachings and shipwrecks were common. These frequent losses {{combined with the}} town's strategic location as the gateway to the Baltic led to Skagen being the site of one of Denmark's earliest lighthouses, Vippefyr, a lever light constructed in 1627.

5|$|Christologically Maximus {{insisted on}} a strict dyophysitism, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{corollary}} of the emphasis on theosis. In terms of salvation, humanity {{is intended to be}} fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} quarter of the 7th century, the {{quayside}} settlement at Gipeswic (Ipswich) became an important estuarine trading centre, receiving imported goods such as pottery from other trading markets situated around the coasts of the North Sea. Steven Plunkett suggests that the founding of Gipeswic took place under Wuffingas supervision. It took another hundred years for the settlement to develop into a town, but its beginnings <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reflection of the personal importance of Rædwald during the period of his supremacy.|$|E
5|$|Goya {{worked on}} The Disasters of War {{during a period}} when he was {{producing}} images more for his own satisfaction than for any contemporary audience. His work came to rely less on historical incidents than his own imagination. Many of the later plates contain fantastical motifs which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> return to the imagery of the Caprichos. In this, he is relying on visual clues derived from his inner life, rather than {{anything that could be}} recognised from real events or settings.|$|E
5|$|This scheme <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{mechanism}} for representation. First, MPs are {{chosen by the}} electorate to represent their concerns and needs in Parliament. Secondly, the Prime Minister, who is vested with the confidence of majority of the MPs, and the Cabinet which {{is made up of}} popularly elected MPs, effectively represent the views of the electorate as he heads the Government. The structure of the executive is therefore based on the concept of political representation.|$|E

5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual {{baskets of}} fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's vibrant {{arrangements}} of apples, the mundane Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and ethics of the work were perfectly reasonable debate topics {{for those who had}} not even seen the piece. Warhol's pop art <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> relation to Minimal art {{in the sense that it}} attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E
5|$|From {{a purely}} {{literary}} and historical point of view, Either/Or <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> thinly veiled autobiography {{of the events}} between Kierkegaard and his ex-fianceé Regine Olsen. Johannes the Seducer in The Diary of a Seducer treats {{the object of his}} affection, Cordelia, much as Kierkegaard treats Regine: befriending her family, asking her to marry him, and breaking off the engagement. Either/Or, then, could be the poetic and literary expression of Kierkegaard's decision between a life of sensual pleasure, as he had experienced in his youth, or a possibility of marriage and what social responsibilities marriage might or ought to entail. Ultimately however, Either/Or stands philosophically independent of its relation to Kierkegaard's life.|$|E
5|$|In 1392, King Richard II of England {{created the}} first in a {{succession}} of Ireland kings of arms. It is unknown why such an office was called into being. Froissart notes the creation of Chandos le Roy d'Ireland, but does not give any clues as to the reasoning. It does, however, fit into the general English policy in Ireland at the time. Richard II sought to re-establish English control in those areas where the native Irish had reasserted their independence. The appointment <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> necessary part of the preparations for the appointment of the Duke of Gloucester as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1392. Richard intended Gloucester to lead a major military campaign, and such a campaign would have necessitated the involvement of heralds to marshal arms and provide advice and evidence in case of heraldic disputes.|$|E

40|$|Cognition {{can appear}} complex {{owing to the}} fact that the brain is capable of an {{enormous}} repertoire of behaviors. However, this complexity <b>can</b> <b>be</b> greatly reduced when constraints of time and space are taken into account. The brain is constrained by the body to limit its goal-directed behaviors to just a few independent tasks over the scale of 1 – 2 min, and can pursue only a very small number of independent agendas. These limitations have been characterized from a number of different vantage points such as attention, working memory and dual task performance. It may be possible that the disparate perspectives of all these methodologies <b>can</b> <b>be</b> unified if behaviors <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> modular and hierarchically organized. From this vantage point, cognition <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> having a central problem of scheduling behaviors to achieve short term goals. Thus dual-task paradigms <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> studying the concurrent management of simultaneous, competing agendas. Attention <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> focusing on the decision as to whether to interrupt the current agenda or persevere. Working memory <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the bookkeeping necessary to manage the state of the current active agenda items...|$|R
5|$|Ireland's {{geologic}} history covers {{everything from}} volcanism and tropical seas {{to the last}} glacial period. Ireland was formed in two distinct parts and slowly joined together, uniting about 440 million years ago. As a result of tectonics {{and the effect of}} ice, the sea level has risen and fallen. In every area of the country the rocks which formed <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result. Finally, the impact of the glaciers shaped the landscape seen today. This variation in the two areas along with the differences between volcanic areas and shallow seas gives Ireland a range of soils as well. There are wide bogs and free-draining brown earths. The mountains are granite, sandstone, limestone with karst areas, and basalt formations.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the founders}} of the American Indian Movement, {{including}} Clyde Bellecourt, Vernon Bellecourt, Dennis Banks and Russel Means, were among the first to protest names and mascots such as the Washington Redskins and Chief Wahoo. Vernon Bellecourt also founded the National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media (NCARSM) in 1989. Cornel Pewewardy (Comanche-Kiowa), Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture. Such practices <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism.|$|E
5|$|Although Palmyrene art {{was related}} to that of Greece, it had a {{distinctive}} style unique to the middle-Euphrates region. Palmyrene art is well represented by the bust reliefs which seal the openings of its burial chambers. The reliefs emphasized clothing, jewelry and a frontal representation of the person depicted, characteristics which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> forerunner of Byzantine art. According to Michael Rostovtzeff, Palmyra's art was influenced by Parthian art. However, the origin of frontality that characterized Palmyrene and Parthian arts is a controversial issue; while Parthian origin has been suggested (by Daniel Schlumberger), Michael Avi-Yonah contends {{that it was a}} local Syrian tradition that influenced Parthian art. Little painting, and none of the bronze statues of prominent citizens (which stood on brackets on the main columns of the Great Colonnade), have survived. A damaged frieze and other sculptures from the Temple of Bel, many removed to museums in Syria and abroad, suggest the city's public monumental sculpture.|$|E
