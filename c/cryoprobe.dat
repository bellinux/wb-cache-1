5000|$|The Her Option - Endometrial Ablation System (Cooper Surgical), FDA {{approved}} in 2001, is a treatment that creates sub-zero temperatures to freeze and ablate the endometrium. Following {{the application of}} local anesthetic around the cervix, a physician uses ultrasound to guide the placement of a <b>cryoprobe</b> to the right uterine horn (cornua). The <b>cryoprobe</b> is activated, reducing its temperature to minus 60°C. The <b>cryoprobe</b> is kept in place while ice is formed in the uterine cavity, under ultrasound observation. Once the appropriate time has passed and/or the appropriate depth of ice has been achieved, the <b>cryoprobe</b> is warmed to 37°C. The <b>cryoprobe</b> is then repositioned to the untreated left uterine horn and the procedure is repeated. Finally, the <b>cryoprobe</b> is warmed and removed. In the Her Option Randomized Controlled Trial for FDA approval, the Success Rate was 67% (bleeding reduced to a normal or less level) and Amenorrhea Rate was 22% (bleeding completely eliminated). In addition, 86% of the Her Option patients were Satisfied.|$|E
50|$|Cryoneurolysis is {{performed}} with a <b>cryoprobe,</b> which {{is composed of}} a hollow cannula that contains a smaller inner lumen. The pressurized coolant (nitrous oxide or liquid nitrogen) travels down the lumen and expands {{at the end of}} the lumen into the tip of the hollow cannula. No coolant exits the <b>cryoprobe.</b> The expansion of the pressurized liquid causes the surrounding area to cool (known as the Joule-Thomson effect) and the phase change of the liquid to gas also causes the surrounding area to cool. This causes a visible iceball to form and the tissue surrounding the end of the <b>cryoprobe</b> to freeze. The gas form of the coolant then travels up the length of the <b>cryoprobe</b> and is safely expelled. The tissue surrounding the end of the <b>cryoprobe</b> can reach a temperature as low as -88.5 °C when nitrous oxide is used as the coolant and can reach a temperature as low as -195.8 °C when liquid nitrogen is used as the coolant.|$|E

40|$|Cryosurgery is the {{destruction}} of undesired tissues by freezing, for example, in prostate cryosurgery. Minimally-invasive cryosurgery is currently performed {{by means of an}} array of <b>cryoprobes,</b> each {{in the shape of a}} long hypodermic needle. The optimal arrangement of the <b>cryoprobes,</b> which is known to have a dramatic effect on the quality of the cryoprocedure, is based on the cryosurgeon’s experience. This thesis focuses on an automated computerized technique for cryosurgery planning, in an effort to improve the quality of cryosurgery. A two-phase optimization method is proposed for this purpose, based on two previous and independent developments. Phase I is based on a bubble-packing method, a sphere packing method in the finite domain previously used as an efficient method for finite elements meshing. Phase II is based on a force-field analogy method, which has proven to be robust at the expense of a typically long runtime. Both optimization phases are used to seek an optimal layout and an optimal insertion depth of <b>cryoprobes.</b> Two-dimensional and three-dimensional models of the prostate and urethral warmer have been reconstructed from patient’s ultrasound images.

50|$|Cryosurgery is {{also used}} to treat {{internal}} and external tumors as well as tumors in the bone. To cure internal tumors, a hollow instrument called a <b>cryoprobe</b> is used, which is placed in contact with the tumor. Liquid nitrogen or argon gas is passed through the <b>cryoprobe.</b> Ultrasound or MRI is used to guide the <b>cryoprobe</b> and monitor the freezing of the cells. This helps in limiting damage to adjacent healthy tissues. A ball of ice crystals forms around the probe which results in freezing of nearby cells. When it is required to deliver gas to various parts of the tumor, more than one probe is used. After cryosurgery, the frozen tissue is either naturally absorbed by the body in the case of internal tumors, or it dissolves and forms a scab for external tumors.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In vitro {{studies show}} that new {{miniature}} <b>cryoprobes</b> are suitable for cryoablation of bone tissue. The aim of this animal trial on 24 sheep {{was to examine the}} perioperative complications, particularly the danger of embolism, of cryoablation when using miniature <b>cryoprobes.</b> Methods Cryoablations with 2 freeze-thaw cycles each were carried out in the epiphysis of the right tibia and the metaphysis of the left femur. Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and central venous pressure (CVP) were measured. Throughout the intra- and perioperative phase, heart rate and oxygen saturation by pulse oxymetry, blood gas and electrolytes were monitored regularly. Postoperative complications were examined up to 24 weeks postoperativ. Results As result, no significant increase of PAP, CVP or heart rate were observed. Blood gases were unremarkable, with pO 2 and pCO 2 remaining constant throughout the operation. Regarding pH, standard bicarbonate and base excess, only a non-significant shift towards a slight acidosis was seen. There was a mean hemoglobin decrease of 0. 5 g/dl. One animal showed postoperative wound infection and wound edge necrosis. No major peri- and postoperative complications associated with cryosurgery of bone were observed, especially regarding clinically relevant pulmonary embolism.

40|$|Owing to {{its ability}} to place and use {{multiple}} <b>cryoprobes</b> simultaneously, cryoablation enables the treatment of tumors of any shape. Cryoablation causes ice crystals to form within cells, inducing membrane rupture and cell death via cellular dehydration and local tissue ischemia.

30|$|Common {{complications}} of lung cryoablation {{are similar to}} those of RF and microwave, and include pneumothorax, infection, and pleural fluid. However, haemoptysis during or after the procedure is more common in cryoablation [9], and is more likely to occur in central lesions and when multiple <b>cryoprobes</b> are used. Since haemoptysis may last for days or even weeks after ablation, the use of antiaggregants or anticoagulants is not appropriate during this period. Therefore, cryoablation may not be a good choice in patients who depend on such medications.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background So far, modern {{miniature}} <b>cryoprobes</b> {{were used}} for local destruction of soft tissue tumours without damaging the adjacent healthy tissue. In this study, cryoablation methodology was applied to bone and the cooling capacity of the probe was examined in vitro and in vivo. Method Freezing was performed by cooling one or two probes (diameter 3. 2 mm) to - 180 °C with liquid nitrogen. The cooling capacity of the probes was determined optically and thermally against a homogeneous reference gel, followed by in vivo measurements on femoral and tibial sheep bone followed by histological examination. Results Thanks to the synergistic effect, the simultaneous use of 2 probes produced an almost spherical expansion of cold in the homogenous gelatin. During the in vivo freezes, the temperature curves showed a more moderate trend. Nevertheless, due to the synergistic effect, temperatures below - 50 °C could be reached {{at a distance of}} 1 cm from the probe. No local or systemic intraoperative complications were observed. Histological examination revealed cell necrosis up into the - 10 °C isotherm. Conclusions Adequate tissue cooling of the bone matrix can be achieved with in vivo freezes by means of one or more miniature <b>cryoprobes.</b> Therefore, this probe could provide an alternative to or supplement surgical resection of pathological bone processes. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{present the}} {{functional}} and oncological mid-term results of laparoscopic cryoablation of renal masses using third generation ultrathin (17 -gauge[G]) <b>cryoprobes.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS • Consecutive patients with small renal masses treated by cryoablation from September 2003 to September 2008 were prospectively evaluated. The cryoablation was performed using multiple third generation 17 -G <b>cryoprobes</b> after intraoperative mass biopsy. • Data on serum creatinine measurements and cross sectional imaging (computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging) were regularly collected {{according to a}} previously determined protocol. Follow-up was censored in October 2009. • Renal function analysis was based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 1 year compared with baseline. Residual (or persistent tumour) and recurrence were defined {{as the presence of}} residual enhancement at first follow-up and ‘de novo’ enhancement of a non-enhancing cryolesion at any time during follow-up. • Survival data were analysed using the Kaplan–Meier method. Best estimates for the overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and metastatic-free survival (MFS) were made for patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and for patients with RCC or non-diagnostic biopsy. RESULTS • A total of 92 patients (100 tumours; mean size 2. 5 ± 0. 8 cm) were treated in 95 sessions. The mean follow-up was 30. 2 ± 16. 6 months (Mean values are ±SD). • Intraoperative biopsy showed RCC in 51 patients (53. 7 %), benign lesion in 23 patients (24. 2 %) and was non-diagnostic in 21 patients (22. 1 %). Three tumour persistences and four radiological recurrences were detected. • The estimated mean RFS time and 3 -year OS and RFS in patients with RCC exclusively were 47. 8 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 44. 1 – 51. 1) months, 86. 1 % (95 % CI: 71. 2 – 93. 6) and 91. 8 % (95 % CI: 76. 3 – 97. 3), respectively. The figures were slightly higher in the group of patients with RCC or unknown pathology. The actual CSS and MFS rates were 100 %. • Renal function was preserved in 84. 5 % of patients with normal preoperative eGFR. • Baseline eGFR was the only predictor of renal insufficiency development at 1 -year follow-up.

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction and objective: Focal {{cryotherapy}} {{emerged as}} an efficient option to treat favorable and localized prostate cancer (PCa). The purpose of this video is to describe the procedure step by step. Materials and methods: We present {{the case of a}} 68 year-old man with localized PCa in the anterior aspect of the prostate. Results: The procedure is performed under general anesthesia, with the patient in lithotomy position. Briefly, the equipment utilized includes the cryotherapy console coupled with an ultrasound system, argon and helium gas bottles, <b>cryoprobes,</b> temperature probes and an urethral warming catheter. The procedure starts with a real-time trans-rectal prostate ultrasound, which is used to outline the prostate, the urethra and the rectal wall. The <b>cryoprobes</b> are pretested and placed in to the prostate through the perineum, following a grid template, along with the temperature sensors under ultrasound guidance. A cystoscopy confirms the right positioning of the needles and the urethral warming catheter is installed. Thereafter, the freeze sequence with argon gas is started, achieving extremely low temperatures (- 40 °C) to induce tumor cell lysis. Sequentially, the thawing cycle is performed using helium gas. This process is repeated one time. Results among several series showed a biochemical disease-free survival between 71 - 93 % at 9 - 70 month- follow-up, incontinence rates between 0 - 3. 6 % and erectile dysfunction between 0 - 42 % (1 – 5). Conclusions: Focal cryotherapy is a feasible procedure to treat anterior PCa that may offer minimal morbidity, allowing good cancer control and better functional outcomes when compared to whole-gland treatment...|$|R
50|$|The use of {{cold for}} pain relief {{and as an}} {{anti-inflammatory}} has been known {{since the time of}} Hippocrates (460-377 B.C). Since then there have been numerous accounts of ice used for pain relief including from the Ancient Egyptians and Avicenna of Persia (A.D.982-1070). In 1812 Napoleon's Surgeon General noted that half-frozen soldiers from the Moscow battle were able to tolerate amputations with reduced pain and in 1851, ice and salt mixtures were promoted by Arnott for the treatment of nerve pain. Campbell White, in 1899, was the first to employ refrigerants for medical use and Allington, in 1950, was the first to use liquid nitrogen for medical treatments. In 1961, Cooper et al. created an early <b>cryoprobe,</b> which reached a temperature of -190 °C using liquid nitrogen. Shortly thereafter, in 1967, an ophthalmic surgeon named Amoils used carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide to create a <b>cryoprobe</b> which reached a temperature of -70 °C.|$|E
50|$|Cryoextraction {{is a form}} of ICCE that freezes {{the lens}} with a {{cryogenic}} substance such as liquid nitrogen. In this technique, the cataract is extracted through use of a cryoextractor — a <b>cryoprobe</b> whose refrigerated tip adheres to and freezes tissue of the lens, permitting its removal. Although it is now used primarily for the removal of subluxated lenses, it was the favored form of cataract extraction from the late 1960s to the early 1980s.|$|E

The most common heart operations in which cryosurgery may be used in this way are mitral valve repairs and coronary artery bypass grafting. During the procedure, a flexible <b>cryoprobe</b> is placed on or around the heart and delivers cold energy that disables tissue responsible for conducting the arrhythmia.|$|E
30|$|Straight percutaneously placed <b>cryoprobes</b> deliver room {{temperature}} argon gas (for cooling) and helium gas (for thawing) with two cycles of 10 -min freezing {{separated by a}} 5 -min cycle of active thawing usually constituting a typical ablation session [8].

Disadvantages include the increased cost and time duration [6]. Concerning active protective measures, all kinds of gas dissection can be performed; however, hydrodissection is contraindicated since fluid will freeze when {{in contact with the}} ice ball.
