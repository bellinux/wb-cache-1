A basic limitation of the technique is the <b>chromatic</b> <b>dispersion</b> of grating diffraction, which limits its spatial resolution. A tabletop system with a tungsten-target x-ray tube running at 60kVp will have a limiting resolution of 60µm. Another constraint is that the x-ray beam is slitted down to only tens of micrometers wide. A potential solution has been proposed in the form of parallel imaging with multiple slits.|$|E
2500|$|Glass has {{the ability}} to refract, reflect, and {{transmit}} light following geometrical optics, without scattering it (due to the absence of grain boundaries). It is used in the manufacture of lenses and windows. Common glass has a refraction index around 1.5. This may be modified by adding low-density materials such as boron, which lowers the index of refraction (see crown glass), or increased (to as much as 1.8) with high-density materials such as (classically) lead oxide (see flint glass and lead glass), or in modern uses, less toxic oxides of zirconium, titanium, or barium.

40|$|Abstract—We propose an {{approach}} for {{the measurement of}} microwave frequency in the optical domain with adjustable mea-surement range and resolution. In the proposed approach, two optical wavelengths with a large wavelength spacing are modulated by an unknown microwave signal in a Mach–Zehnder modulator (MZM). The optical output from the MZM is sent to a dispersive fiber to introduce different <b>chromatic</b> <b>dispersions,</b> leading to dif-ferent microwave power penalties. The two wavelengths are then separated, with the microwave powers measured by two photode-tectors. A fixed relationship between the microwave power ratio and the microwave frequency is established. The microwave fre-quency is estimated by measuring the two microwave powers. The frequency measurement range and resolution can be adjusted by tuning the wavelength spacing. Different frequency measurement ranges and resolutions are demonstrated experimentally. Index Terms—Fiber, microwave frequency measurement, mi-crowave photonics, optical microwave signal processing.

40|$|Sub-sampling {{can acquire}} {{directly}} a passband within a broad radio frequency (RF) range, avoiding down-conversion and low-phase-noise tunable local oscillation (LO). However, sub-sampling suffers from band folding and self-image interference. In this {{paper we propose}} a frequency-oriented sub-sampling to solve the two problems. With ultrashort optical pulse and a pair of <b>chromatic</b> <b>dispersions,</b> the broadband RF signal is firstly short-time Fourier-transformed to a spectrum-spread pulse. Then a time slot, corresponding to the target spectrum slice, is coherently optical-sampled with in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) demodulation. We demonstrate the novel bandpass sampling by a numerical example, which shows the desired uneven intensity response, i. e. pre-filtering. We show in theory that appropriate time-stretch capacity from dispersion can result in pre-filtering bandwidth less than sampling rate. Image rejection due to I/Q sampling is also analyzed. A proof-of-concept experiment, which is based on a time-lens sampling source and chirped fiber Bragg gratings (CFBGs), shows the center-frequency-tunable pre-filtered sub-sampling with bandwidth of 6 GHz around, as well as imaging rejection larger than 26 dB. Our technique may benefit future broadband RF receivers for frequency-agile Radar or channelization. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Mid-infrared supercontinuum {{generation}} (SCG) {{is mostly}} studied in fluoride glass fibers in which long fibers and high power pump sources are needed. Taking advantages of high nonlinearity and transparency, chalcogenide glass is also applied for SCG in mid-infrared region, where specific strategy {{is needed to}} compensate large normal material dispersion. We investigate multimaterial fibers (MMFs) combined with fluoride and chalcogenide glasses for SCG. The high refraction contrast allows the zero dispersion point of the fiber to shift to below 2 mu m without air holes. These two materials have similar glass transition temperatures and thermal expansion coefficients. They are possible to be drawn together. Both step-index MMFs and microstructured MMFs (MS-MMFs) are considered. The <b>chromatic</b> <b>dispersions</b> and supercontinuum spectra are studied. A 20 dB bandwidth of over one octave SCG with high coherence {{can be obtained from}} a 1 cm MS-MMF at 1. 95 mu m with a pumping peak power of 175 W. As the pump power increased, the spectrum can extend to 5 mu m. In this scheme the fiber is so short that the high level of loss, which is the feature of MMFs, will not cause problems.

40|$|The {{development}} of wireless communication services requires broader access bandwidth. To meet this requirement, unlicensed millimeter wave (mm-wave) band {{has been considered}} as a potential carrier {{for the next generation}} wireless communications. However, due to high attenuation loss in mm-wave signal transmission, the number of the picocell base station (BS) should be increased in the coverage area. Radio over fiber (RoF) transport scheme is a good option to face the challenge of mm-wave wireless distribution, because it takes advantages of long transmission distance, large bandwidth and immunity to electromagnetic interference. In RoF technique, optical mm-wave signal generation is one of the crucial issues. There are two major schemes to generate optical mm-wave signals, optical heterodyning technique and optical frequency multiplication (OFM) technique, in which OFM technique can provide simpler BS configuration. One of the most popular OFM techniques is optical harmonic generation using optical external modulators. There are mainly two options of external modulator: one is Mach-Zehnder Modulator (MZM) and the other is Electro-Absorption Modulator (EAM). The objective of this thesis is to propose a novel photonic frequency doubling and quadrupling technique for the generation of mm-wave signal using two cascaded EAMs. The two cascaded EAMs driven by a low frequency radio frequency (RF) signal and the phase shift between the two EAMs is 180 degree. Theory of techniques using two cascaded EAMs with identical characteristics and two cascaded EAMs with different characteristics is investigated and verified by simulation based on VPI Transmission Maker. Good agreement is achieved between theory and simulation. It is shown that power of doubling and quadrupling signal is increasing with RF modulation index, and bias voltages of EAMs also have a great impact on the performance of the system. It is found that by using cascaded EAMs with identical characteristics, odd-order optical harmonics are perfectly suppressed while even-order harmonics are maximized, and as a result high quality frequency doubling and quadrupling signals can be generated; by using cascaded EAMs with different characteristics, good system performance still can be achieve when phase shift, RF modulation voltage and bias voltages are optimized. Power fading induced by fiber <b>chromatic</b> <b>dispersions</b> is also investigated and an optical filter is adopted {{in order to make the}} system immune to <b>chromatic</b> <b>dispersions</b> at frequency quadrupling. Experiment is also carried out to verify the concept of the proposed technique. A low cost electro-absorption modulator integrated laser (EML) is used in experiment to achieve a cost-effective system. Good quality doubling signal and quadrupling signal are generated while noise level is reasonable. It suggests that the proposed technique is efficient for mm-wave generation using frequency doubling or quadruplin...|$|R
50|$|Newton first {{demonstrated}} {{the presence of}} chromatic aberration in the human eye in 1670. He observed that isolated incident light rays directed at an opaque card held close to the eye strike the refracting surfaces of the eye obliquely and are therefore strongly refracted. Because the indices of refraction (see: Refractive Index) vary inversely with wavelength, blue rays (short wavelength) will be refracted more than red rays (long wavelength). This phenomenon is called <b>chromatic</b> <b>dispersion</b> and {{has important implications for}} the optical performance of the eye, including the stereoptic effect. For example, Newton noted that such <b>chromatic</b> <b>dispersion</b> causes the edges of a white object to be tinged with color.|$|E
