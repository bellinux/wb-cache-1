50|$|A {{noise gate}} sets a {{threshold}} where {{if it is}} quieter it will not let the signal pass {{and if it is}} louder it opens the gate. A noise gate's function is in a sense the opposite to that of a <b>compressor.</b> <b>Noise</b> gates are useful for microphones which will pick up noise which is not relevant to the program, such as the hum of a miked electric guitar amplifier or the rustling of papers on a minister's lectern. Noise gates are also used to process the microphones placed near the drums of a drum kit in many hard rock and metal bands. Without a noise gate, the microphone for a specific instrument such as the floor tom will also pick up signal from nearby drums or cymbals. With a noise gate, the threshold of sensitivity for each microphone on the drum kit can be set so that only the direct strike and subsequent decay of the drum will be heard, not the nearby sounds.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} {{can be both}} {{a subjective}} immission control and an objective emission control. Normally there are daily curfews and in some case weekend curfews. The subjective aspect is to prevent noise disturbance in the adjacent community. The objective aspect is to control the sound output of specific machines. There are four major sources of site noise: (1) direct sound from continually operating equipment such as air compressors; (2) intermittent sound from equipment such as jack hammers;(3)backup alarms; and (4) hauling equipment such as trucks. Air <b>compressor</b> <b>noise</b> is regulated by CFR 204 and backup alarms are regulated by CFR 1926. Boston, MA(Section 16-26.4) permits construction on weekdays between 7am and 6 pm. Madison, WI (Chapter 24.08) limits sound levels to 88 dB(A) at 50 Feet. Miami, FL (Section 36-6) considers the noise a noise disturbance if it occurs between 6pm and 8am during the week and any time on Sunday. Dallas, TX (Section 30-2 (9)) permits construction in residential zones from 7am to 7pm on weekdays, from 9am to 7pm on Saturdays and Holidays, and prohibits construction on Sundays. Albuquerque,NM (Section 9-9-8) has a more complex control. It prohibits construction and demolition within 500 feet of noise sensitive properties (residences included) if the equipment sound control devices are less effective than the original equipment and if noise mitigation measures are not used when the levels exceed 90 dB (weighting not specified) or more than 80 dB during the day for three days.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{in order}} to reduce the {{external}} radiation of food refrigeration <b>compressor’s</b> <b>noise,</b> the main noise frequency analysis based on the theoretical calculation and practical experiment is carried out and the acoustic enclosure design is conducted. Conventional sound-absorbing material adopts rock wool and glass wool which have poor environmental protection. In the design process the environmental friendly melamine cotton is chosen as the sound-absorbing material that has not ever been massively adopted. What’s more, with a consideration of ventilation and heat dissipation, acoustic enclosure interior is designed with muffler air duct and the low-speed and low-noise fan. Therefore, both the normal operation of the compressor and the sound insulation of the acoustic enclosure are ensured in this way. Then with the sound level meter the noise A-weighted SPLs of the compressor with and without the enclosure are measured and are compared with each other. The results show that after covering the acoustic enclosure the <b>compressor’s</b> <b>noise</b> is less than 60 dB, which meets the design requirements of noise control. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that the sound insulation of the acoustic enclosure reaches the design standards and the acoustic enclosure design is feasible...|$|R

One specific source of constant and intense noise is that produced by compressors used for the extraction and transportation of natural gas. Terrestrial arthropods {{play a central role}} in many ecosystems, and given that numerous species rely upon airborne sounds and substrate-borne vibrations in their life histories, we predicted that increased background sound levels or the presence of <b>compressor</b> <b>noise</b> would influence their distributions. In the second largest natural gas field in the United States (San Juan Basin, New Mexico, USA), we assessed differences in the abundances of terrestrial arthropod families and community structure as a function of <b>compressor</b> <b>noise</b> and background sound level. Using pitfall traps, we simultaneously sampled five sites adjacent to well pads that possessed operating compressors, and five alternate, quieter well pad sites that lacked compressors, but were otherwise similar. We found a negative association between sites with <b>compressor</b> <b>noise</b> or higher levels of background sound and the abundance of five arthropod families and one genus, a positive relationship between loud sites and the abundance of one family, and no relationship between noise level or compressor presence and abundance for six families and two genera. Despite these changes, we found no evidence of community turnover as a function of background sound level or site type (compressor and noncompressor). Our results indicate that anthropogenic noise differentially affects the abundances of some arthropod families. These preliminary findings point to a need to determine the direct and indirect mechanisms driving these observed responses. Given the diverse and important ecological functions provided by arthropods, changes in abundances could have ecological implications. Therefore, we recommend the consideration of arthropods in the environmental assessment of noise-producing infrastructure...|$|E

40|$|Tutorialpg. 203 - 212 This {{paper will}} review the best {{practices}} for installation of a centrifugal air compressor without a sound enclosure to obtain the best acoustic environment for reduced operating noise levels. An overview of the noise sources associated with a centrifugal air compressor will be discussed along with the noise attenuation techniques. Moreover, proper selection and installation of accessory hardware associated with the compressor installation will be addressed, since the accessory hardware can often generate higher noise levels than the compressor if not selected and installed correctly. Guidelines for valve sizing, proper lagging of piping and valves for noise reduction, drain line noise attenuation, inlet silencer selection, discharge silencer selection and silencer installation will also be explored. The refining, petrochemical, oil and gas, automotive, steel, electronic and industrial applications utilize centrifugal air compressors to provide utility air to support manufacturing their processes. They are often purchased to meet a specified noise level based on customer site requirements. Compressors that meet the noise requirement without using a complete sound enclosure are preferred. This is due to both the high cost associated with sound enclosures and because sound enclosures make access to the compressor difficult for maintenance. Figure 1 shows a typical centrifugal air compressor package for a refinery application. Proper site development is important for reduced noise levels while the equipment is in operation. Outdoor installations do not exactly replicate a Free Field noise environment; indoor installations are often reverberant in nature because of building construction.
