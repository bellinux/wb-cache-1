5|$|For many years, the Moon {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an excellent site for telescopes. It is relatively nearby; astronomical seeing is not a concern; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold, and thus especially useful for infrared telescopes; and radio telescopes {{on the far side}} would be shielded from the radio <b>chatter</b> <b>of</b> Earth. The lunar soil, although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes, can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed in the construction of mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter. A lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with ionic liquid.|$|E

The silence of the pine forest is often broken by the <b>chatter</b> <b>of</b> a red squirrel as it sees visitors. In the winter months, one may catch sight of a red-breasted nuthatch as it searches the bark of a nearby pine for food.|$|E

500|$|The song {{deals with}} a feminist theme of the war of the sexes. It is a [...] "feminist plea about women's place in history" [...] with the title {{referring}} to the [...] "cowardice of men". In the song, Farmer [...] "reverses the roles", and [...] "presents women as warriors". In the first couplet, she evokes [...] "the {{role of women in}} History", recalling that [...] "all the great men had on their side a woman to support, assist and advise them". However, the singer said that [...] "all this was done to the detriment of women and cites as example, Mary, Jesus Christ's mother, a symbol of martyrdom and self-sacrifice". She denounces [...] "the hypocrisy and the <b>chatter</b> <b>of</b> men who think only about power and sex". In the refrain, she advises women to rebel by taking up arms.|$|E
500|$|By being {{composed}} using {{nothing more}} than a Rhodes piano, a vocal sample, and turntable scratches, [...] "Everything I Am" [...] stands as the third studio album's most minimalistic production. West marries a down-tempo beat to gentle piano chords which are accentuated by soulful cooing sampled from [...] "If We Can't Be Lovers" [...] by Prince Phillip Mitchell. The low-key track has a scratched hook by DJ Premier formed with the vocal sample, which contains the line, [...] "Here we go again", that is lifted from [...] "Bring the Noise" [...] by Public Enemy. With its thick, heavy bass-line pattern, [...] "The Glory" [...] is an up-tempo number which revisits the [...] "chipmunk-soul" [...] that once defined Kanye's early production style. It displays a sped-up and high-pitched vocal sample of [...] "Save The Country" [...] by Laura Nyro accompanied by uplifting strings, keys, and an all-male gospel choir. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin sings the chorus and supplies a gospel-style piano motif while West raps over heavy yet buoyant drums on [...] "Homecoming." [...] The <b>chatter</b> <b>of</b> a noisy, cheering crowd can inexplicably be heard lurking in the background throughout the track. The Jay-Z ode [...] "Big Brother" [...] begins with West uttering the words, [...] "Stadium status...," [...] backed by a string orchestra, pounding drums, a distorted guitar riff and plinking piano keys. Around mid-verse, the track adopts synths that mimic the melodies of the string section. Before the second verse, additional instrumentation enters; including a heavy bass-line, metallic percussion, and 808-handclaps. The studio album's final track [...] "Good Night" [...] exhibits the production characteristics of West's next musical evolution. West juxtaposes the glitchy, mechanical sound of an 8-bit beat with the more elegant, traditional sound of a classical piano.|$|E

2500|$|Chapter 7 sees Suction {{continue}} to espouse his philosophical beliefs; [...] "Hang philosophy – I {{would not give}} a farthing for it do all by your feelings and never think at all about it." [...] Similarly, Quid voices his own opinion {{of some of the}} most respected writers at the time; [...] "I think that Homer is bombast & Shakespeare is too wild & Milton has no feelings they might be easily outdone Chatterton never writ those poems." [...] In relation to this criticism, Damon comments, [...] "he is merely repeating the conventional <b>chatter</b> <b>of</b> the critics, which was the exact opposite of what Blake actually thought." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the 2011 Pre-Grammy Gala in Los Angeles, Kelly {{performed}} {{a medley of}} hits including [...] "Happy People", [...] "When a Woman's Fed Up" [...] and [...] "Bump N' Grind". Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "Kelly is a single-bound kind of leaper who dips into everything from soft porn to opera in his music. His supreme chutzpah, a quality he shares with Streisand, allows him to feel secure within pop's traditions while taking them wherever he pleases. He made Davis' musical program, which at times got lost amid the <b>chatter</b> <b>of</b> the A-list crowd, come alive. It was all so simple then: an instant when one of pop's key traditional elements, that determination to wow, took on new dimension {{in the hands of}} an expert." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Turkish {{occupation}} (1541–1686), Islamic culture {{flourished in}} Budapest, multiple mosques and baths {{were built in}} the city. These were great examples of Ottoman architecture, which was influenced by Muslims from around the world not limited to Turkish, Iranian, Arabian and to a larger extent, Byzantine architecture as well as Islamic traditions. After Holy Army conquered Budapest they turned most of the mosques with Churches, Minarets were turned into bell towers and cathedral spires. At one point in time distinct sloping central square in Budapest became an bustling Oriental bazaar, which was filled with “the <b>chatter</b> <b>of</b> camel caravans on their way to Yemen and India”. Budapest is in fact {{one of the few places}} in the world with functioning original Turkish bathhouses dating back to the 16th century, like Rudas Baths or Király Baths. Another little known fact is that Budapest is home to the northernmost place where a Tomb of an influential Islamic [...] Turkish Sufi Dervish, the Tomb of Gül Baba, a dervis could be found. Various cultures converged in Hungary seemed to coalesce well with each other, as if all these different cultures and architecture styles are digested into Hungary’s own way of cultural blend. A precedent to show the city’s self-conscious is the top section of the city’s main square, currently named as Szechenyi. In medieval time. When Turks came to the city, they built Mosque here which was aggressively replaced with Gothic church of St. Bertalan. The rationale of reusing the base of the former Islamic building mosque and reconstruction into Gothic Church but Islamic style architecture over it is typically Islamic are still visible. An official term for the rationale is spolia. The mosque was called the djami of Pasha Gazi Kassim, and djami means mosque in Arabic. After Turks and Muslims were expelled and massacred from Budapest, the site was reoccupied by Christians and reformed into a church, the Inner City Parish Church. The minaret and Turkish entranceway were removed. The shape of the architecture is its only hint of exotic past—“two surviving prayer niches facing Mecca and an ecumenical symbol atop its cupola: a cross rising above the Turkish crescent moon”.|$|E
