5|$|Before {{his tenure}} as {{government}} minister, Hareide had sat through one term in the municipal council of his native Bømlo, served as a deputy representative to the national parliament as well as working two years as a State Secretary. He was also second deputy leader of his party from 2003 to 2007, having <b>come</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ranks of the party's youth organization.|$|E

5|$|In 1844, Longstreet met {{his future}} first wife Maria Louisa Garland, called Louise by her family. She was the {{daughter}} of Longstreet's commander, Lt. Col. Garland. Little is known of their courtship or marriage. Longstreet never once mentioned Louise in his memoirs, and there are no surviving letters between the two. Most anecdotes about their relationship <b>come</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> writings of Longstreet's second wife, Helen Dortch Longstreet.|$|E

5|$|The Golden Gophers {{have had}} many {{successful}} players <b>come</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> program throughout its history. In {{the early years}} of basketball, when the Gophers had success, they recruited some of {{the best players in the}} country. George Tuck was a dominant center, and the first All-America for the Gophers in 1905. Frank Lawler was another early star: he led the Big Ten in scoring in 1911 and was also named to the All-America team, and helped the Gophers to a contested conference title.|$|E
5|$|At this time, {{the side}} was {{predominantly}} composed of local players who had <b>come</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> club's youth system, including Matthews, Sale, Steele and John McCue, {{all in their}} prime, {{as well as the}} newly discovered Neil Franklin, regarded as the country's best centre-half. In the 1946–47 season, Stoke mounted a serious title challenge: the club needed a win in their final game of the season to win the First Division title, but a 2–1 defeat to Sheffield United gave the title to Liverpool. Stanley Matthews left the club three games {{before the end of the}} 1946–47 season to join Blackpool at the age of 32 for a fee of £11,500. The team subsequently failed to mount a title challenge in the following two seasons, 1947–48 and 1948–49, finishing 15th and 11th respectively.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in July 1940, the Red Army General Staff {{developed}} war {{plans that}} identified the Wehrmacht {{as the most}} dangerous threat to the Soviet Union, {{and that in the}} case of a war with Germany, the Wehrmacht's main attack would <b>come</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> region north of the Pripyat Marshes into Belorussia, which later proved to be correct. Stalin disagreed, and in October he authorized the development of new plans that assumed a German attack would focus on the region south of Pripyat Marshes towards the economically vital regions in Ukraine. This became the basis for all subsequent Soviet war plans and the deployment of their armed forces in preparation for the German invasion.|$|E

5|$|The 'Morris' strongpoint near Colleville-sur-Mer was {{captured}} after {{about an hour}} of fighting. The nearby 'Hillman' strongpoint, headquarters of the 736th Infantry Regiment, was a large complex defensive work that had <b>come</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> morning's bombardment essentially undamaged. It was not captured until 20:15. The 2nd Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry began advancing to Caen on foot, coming within a few kilometres of the town, but had to withdraw {{due to lack of}} armour support. At 16:00, the 21st Panzer Division mounted a counter-attack between Sword and Juno and nearly succeeded in reaching the Channel. It met stiff resistance from the British 3rd Division and was soon recalled to assist in the area between Caen and Bayeux. Estimates of Allied casualties on Sword Beach are as high as 1,000.|$|E
5|$|The Blue Devils {{have won}} seven ACC Football Championships, have had ten players honored as ACC Player of the Year (the {{most in the}} ACC), and have had three Pro Football Hall of Famers <b>come</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> program (second in the ACC to only Miami's four). The Blue Devils have {{produced}} 11 College Football Hall of Famers, which is tied for the 2nd most in the ACC. Duke has also won 18 total conference championships (7 ACC, 9 Southern Conference, and 1 Big Five Conference). That total is tied with Clemson for {{the highest in the}} ACC.|$|E
5|$|This fourth IARC {{mission was}} {{conducted}} at the U.S. Army's Fort Benning Soldier Battle Lab using the McKenna MOUT (Military Operations on Urban Terrain) site, which replicates a complete German village created for war gaming when the main cold war threat was perceived to <b>come</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Fulda Gap into Germany. The fourth mission was completed in 2008 with various teams having already demonstrated all of the required aerial robotic behaviors mandated by the fourth mission rules, except being able to demonstrate these behaviors seamlessly in under 15 minutes—a feat considered by the organizer and judges to be inevitable given a bit more time, and therefore no longer a significant challenge. Thus the fourth mission was terminated, $80,000 in awards distributed, and the fifth mission established.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{histories}} of the Bastille were published immediately after July 1789, usually with dramatic titles promising the uncovering of secrets from the prison. By the 1830s and 1840s, popular histories written by Pierre Joigneaux and by the trio of Auguste Maquet, Auguste Arnould and Jules-Édouard Alboize de Pujol presented {{the years of the}} Bastille between 1358 and 1789 as a single, long period of royal tyranny and oppression, epitomised by the fortress; their works featured imaginative 19th-century reconstructions of the medieval torture of prisoners. As living memories of the Revolution faded, the destruction of the Bastille meant that later historians had to rely primarily on memoires and documentary materials in analysing the fortress and the 5,279 prisoners who had <b>come</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Bastille between 1659 and 1789. The Bastille's archives, recording the operation of the prison, had been scattered in the confusion after the seizure; with some effort, the Paris Assembly gathered around 600,000 of them in the following weeks, which form the basis of the modern archive. After being safely stored and ignored for many years, these archives were rediscovered by the French historian François Ravaisson, who catalogued and used them for research between 1866 and 1904.|$|E
5|$|Grand Forks International Airport (GFK, KGFK) {{is served}} by Delta Air Lines with several daily round trips to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport; and Allegiant Air, which {{operates}} flights {{a few times a}} week to Mesa, Arizona (Phoenix-Gateway), Sanford, Florida (Orlando-Sanford) and Las Vegas, Nevada. A new passenger terminal completed in early 2011, allowed more passengers to <b>come</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> airport, improved circulation, added a baggage claim and addressed security and safety concerns. The airport was a major distribution center for FedEx, which conducts flights daily within the state and northern Minnesota. FedEx moved their flight operations to Fargo, ND on October 31, 2016. The airport is one of the busiest airports in the country, due in large measure to the presence of the John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences of the University of North Dakota.|$|E
