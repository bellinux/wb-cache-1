Abdominal portal-systemic <b>collaterals</b> may be protective from the formation and growth of oesophageal varices, but available data are inconclusive. AIM: We aimed at investigating the relationship between abdominal portal-systemic <b>collaterals</b> and variceal formation and growth. METHODS: We studied 126 cirrhotic patients without (n= 43) or with small (n= 83) oesophageal varices who entered a protocol of serial ultrasonographic and endoscopic examinations for a median of 55 months. Presence and kind of abdominal portal-systemic <b>collaterals</b> was recorded on first ultrasonography and on each control thereafter. RESULTS: At inclusion, abdominal portal-systemic <b>collaterals</b> were found in 19 / 43 patients without varices and in 23 / 83 patients with small varices (NS). There {{was no difference in}} variceal formation and growth between patients with and without abdominal portal-systemic <b>collaterals</b> at inclusion. However, patients developing new abdominal portal-systemic <b>collaterals</b> during follow-up had a significantly higher rate of variceal formation (56. 2...|$|R

In addition, in patients with old diaphragmatic myocardial infarction, both poor and good <b>collaterals</b> were associated with a lower frequency of severe asynergy of the diaphragmatic left ventricular segments at left ventriculography (54 % and 14 %, respectively), {{compared to patients with}} no <b>collaterals</b> to the right coronary artery (92 %, P less than 0. 02 vs. poor <b>collaterals,</b> P less than 0. 001 vs. good <b>collaterals).</b> In contrast, in patients with left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion, the presence of either poor or good <b>collaterals</b> to the left anterior descending coronary artery was not associated with a lower frequency of old anterior myocardial infarction, or, in patients with old anterior myocardial infarction, with a less severe asynergy of the anterior left ventricular segments.

Totally four relational networks, i. e., the networks for medicinal attributes and functions, for chemical composition and meridians and <b>collaterals,</b> for meridians and <b>collaterals</b> and medicinal functions, and for meridians and <b>collaterals</b> were constructed based on the significant point correlations. Network analysis indicated that the former three ones are scale-free complex networks {{and the last one}} tends to be a random network. Node degrees of the four networks follow power-law distribution. Detailed between-attribute relationships and medicinal mechanisms were revealed. For example, concerning chemical composition categories, alkaloids and amines have positive correlation / correspondence. More alkaloids correspond to more amines. Alkaloids negatively correlate with volatile oils / ordinary oils, carbohydrates / starch, ketones / flavonoids, and olefins. Alkaloids mainly function in decrease internal heat, dry dampness, etc. Organic acids and alkaloids have negative correlation. More organic acids mean the less alkaloids.

40|$|Neurons in the {{developing}} CNS tend to send out long axon <b>collaterals</b> to multiple target areas. For these neurons to attain specific connections, some of their axon <b>collaterals</b> are subsequently pruned—a process called stereotyped axon pruning. One {{of the most striking}} examples of stereotyped pruning in the CNS is the pruning of corticospinal tract (CST) axons. The long CST <b>collaterals</b> from layer V neurons of the visual and motor cortices are differentially pruned during development. Here we demonstrate that select plexins and neuropilins, which serve as coreceptors for semaphorins, are expressed in visual cortical neurons at the time when CST axon <b>collaterals</b> are stereotypically pruned. By analyzing mutant mice, we find that the pruning of visual, but not motor, CST axon <b>collaterals</b> depends on plexin-A 3, plexin-A 4, and neuropilin- 2. Expression pattern study suggests that Sema 3 F is a candidate local cue for the pruning of visual CST axons. Using electron microscopic analysis, we also show that visual CST axon <b>collaterals</b> form synaptic contacts in the spinal cord before pruning and that the unpruned <b>collaterals</b> in adult mutant mice are unmyelinated and maintain their synaptic contacts. Our results indicate that the stereotyped pruning of the visual and motor CST axon <b>collaterals</b> is differentially regulated and that this specificity arises from the differential expression of plexin receptors in the cortex...|$|R

40|$|The goal {{of acute}} stroke {{treatment}} with intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular recanalization techniques is {{to rescue the}} penumbral tissue. Therefore, knowing {{the factors that influence}} the loss of penumbral tissue is of major interest. In this study we aimed to identify factors that determine the evolution of the penumbra in patients with proximal (M 1 or M 2) middle cerebral artery occlusion. Among these factors <b>collaterals</b> as seen on angiography were of special interest. Forty-four patients were included in this analysis. They had all received endovascular therapy and at least minimal reperfusion was achieved. Their penumbra was assessed with perfusion- and diffusion-weighted imaging. Perfusion-weighted imaging volumes were defined by circular singular value decomposition deconvolution maps (Tmax > 6 s) and results were compared with volumes obtained with non-deconvolved maps (time to peak > 4 s). Loss of penumbral volume was defined as difference of post- minus pretreatment diffusion-weighted imaging volumes and calculated in per cent of pretreatment penumbral volume. Correlations between baseline characteristics, reperfusion, <b>collaterals,</b> time to reperfusion and penumbral volume loss were assessed using analysis of covariance. <b>Collaterals</b> (P = 0. 021), reperfusion (P = 0. 003) and their interaction (P = 0. 031) independently influenced penumbral tissue loss, but not time from magnetic resonance (P = 0. 254) or from symptom onset (P = 0. 360) to reperfusion. Good <b>collaterals</b> markedly slowed down and reduced the penumbra loss: in patients with thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2 b- 3 reperfusion and without any haemorrhage, 27 % of the penumbra was lost with 8. 9 ml/h with grade 0 <b>collaterals,</b> whereas 11 % with 3. 4 ml/h were lost with grade 1 <b>collaterals.</b> With grade 2 <b>collaterals</b> the penumbral volume change was − 2 % with − 1. 5 ml/h, indicating an overall diffusion-weighted imaging lesion reversal. We conclude that <b>collaterals</b> and reperfusion are the main factors determining loss of penumbral tissue in patients with middle cerebral artery occlusions. <b>Collaterals</b> markedly reduce and slow down penumbra loss. In patients with good <b>collaterals,</b> time to successful reperfusion accounts only for a minor fraction of penumbra loss.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that coronary <b>collaterals</b> improve the prognosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). However, there is limited clinical information on the protective role of <b>collaterals</b> in patients with stable coronary artery disease. This information may help risk stratification {{and the development of}} novel therapies, such as arteriogenesis and angiogenesis. The relation between <b>collaterals</b> and cardiac death or MI at I year after coronary revascularization was studied in 561 patients who were enrolled in a randomized study that compared stent implantation with bypass grafting. <b>Collaterals</b> were assessed on an angiogram using Rentrop's classification and considered present with a Rentrop grade > 1. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for cardiac death or MI at 1 year were calculated using univairiate and multivariate regression analyses. In addition, determinants of <b>collaterals</b> were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. <b>Collaterals</b> were present in 176 patients (31 %). The adjusted odds ratio of cardiac death or infarction was 0. 18 (95 % confidence interval 0. 04 to 0. 78) in the presence of <b>collaterals.</b> Independent determinants of <b>collaterals</b> were age (odds ratio 0. 97, 95 % confidence interval 0. 95 to 0. 99), multivessel disease (odds ratio 1. 60, 95 % confidence interval 1. 02 to 2. 51), impaired ventricular function (odds ratio 1. 85, 95 % confidence interval 1. 04 to 3. 29), type C lesion (odds ratio 3. 72, 95 % confidence interval 2. 33 to 5. 95). and stenosis severity > 90 % (odds ratio 9. 08, 95 % confidence interval 4. 65 to 17. 73). In conclusion, in patients with a low risk profile, the presence of <b>collaterals</b> protects against cardiac death and MI at 1 year after coronary revascularization. Variables that reflect the duration and severity of the atherosclerotic and ischemic burden determine their presence. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserve...|$|R
