Ibrahim's army was led by a Laconian from Bardounia named Bosinas who had assistance from the Egyptian fleet. On August 27, he reached Kariopoli {{in an attempt to}} take a safe path through the mountains. Before he reached the town of Polytsaravos, his army of 8,000 Egyptians was delayed by Theodoros Stathakos and his family of thirteen men who refused to let the invaders past their tower. Bosinas tried to negotiate with Stathakos. Stathakos, feigning surrender, told Bosinas to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> his family's guns. As Bosinas came to retrieve the guns, the Stathakos family killed him. In retaliation, the Egyptians used their two cannons and blew up the tower.|$|E

25|$|The opening quatrain {{begins with}} the {{personification}} of time, a destroyer of great things built by man, a force man cannot equal. The second quatrain portrays a victorless struggle between {{the sea and the}} land. In the last quatrain the speaker applies these lessons to his own situation, realizing that death is inevitable and time will <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> his love away. The concluding couplet, in contrast to Shakespeare's typical practice, provides no solution, no clever twist; only inevitable tears.|$|E

500|$|... "Mmm Papi" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer-songwriter Britney Spears. The {{song was}} written by Spears and Nicole Morier, while {{additional}} writing and song production were done by Canadian band Let's Go to War, whose members are Henry Walter, Adrien Gough and Peter-John Kerr, for Spears' sixth studio album, Circus (2008). [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] is noted for having a Latin pop influence, similar to Madonna's [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] (1987). The lyrics of the song tell {{about a woman who}} has an attraction to a man, longing for him to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> her away.|$|E
500|$|In May 1915, the Turkish {{force that}} would confront the New Zealanders was {{provided}} by the 19th Division, comprising the 57th, 72nd and 77th Infantry Regiments, all under the command of Colonel Mustafa Kemal. Kemal was noted as [...] "the most imaginative, most successful officer to fight on either side" [...] during the Gallipoli Campaign. How the Turks viewed the invasion can be judged by Kemal's orders to his troops following the initial landings; [...] "Men, I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die. In the time that it takes us to die, other forces and commanders can <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> our place." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Astronaut Mike Dexter was referenced in this episode, {{in which}} Liz tells the dental receptionist {{that she did}} not sign the liability waiver as her [...] "boyfriend" [...] Mike Dexter would <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> her home. Liz considers the character to be her imaginary perfect husband. The character was first introduced in [...] "Sun Tea", in which [...] "Dot Com" [...] Slattery (Kevin Brown) pretended to be Mike Dexter, Liz's [...] "crazy black boyfriend", after she planned to get her roommate out of his apartment with Dot Com's help, but her plan backfired. In [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show", Liz's imagination of Mike Dexter was played by actor John Anderson, in a scene where Liz fantasizes about what her life would be like following the success of her talk show, and is then notified by Mike Dexter that he has to go back to outer space. Astronaut Mike Dexter would be mentioned further in the season, but near its end Liz decides her infatuation with him is pathetic and [...] "breaks up" [...] with him in a dream; along with her S4 finale meeting of a pilot played by Matt Damon and her brusque breakup with and dismissal of an annoying anti-love interest played by Michael Sheen; this sets the stage for Liz Lemon to be portrayed as much less of a loser from Season 5 through the series finale.|$|E

500|$|On the Turkish side, by {{that night}} the 2nd Battalion 57th Infantry were on Baby 700, the 3rd Battalion, reduced to only ninety men, were at The Nek, and the 1st Battalion on Mortar Ridge. Just south {{of them was the}} 77th Infantry, next was the 27th Infantry {{opposite}} 400 Plateau. The last regiment, the 72nd Infantry, were on Battleship Hill. As for manpower, the Turks were in a similar situation to the ANZACs. Of the two regiments most heavily involved, the 57th had been destroyed, and the 27th were exhausted with heavy casualties. Large numbers of the 77th had deserted, and the regiment was in no condition to fight. The 72nd was largely intact, but they were a poorly trained force of Arab conscripts. The III Corps, having to deal with both landings, could not assist as they had no reserves available. It was not until 27 April that the 33rd and 64th Infantry Regiments arrived to reinforce the Turkish forces. The ANZACs, however, had been unable to achieve their obectives, and therefore dug in. Gallipoli, like the Western Front, turned into a war of attrition. The German commander, Liman von Saunders, was clear about the reasons for the outcome. He wrote that, [...] "on the Turkish side the situation was saved by the immediate and independent action of the 19th Division." [...] The division commander, Kemal, became noted as [...] "the most imaginative, most successful officer to fight on either side" [...] during the campaign. As a commander he was able {{to get the most out}} of his troops, typified by his order to the 57th Infantry Regiment; [...] "Men, I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die. In the time that it takes us to die, other forces and commanders can <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> our place." ...|$|E

The price for Hotspur's release was the building of the castle of Polnoon in Eaglesham, Renfrewshire for the Montgomeries. It is said that the Duke of Northumberland, head of the Percy family, made overtures for the return of the pennon in 1839 and was given the answer, [...] "There's as good lea land at Eglinton as ever there was at Chevy Chase (Otterburn); let Percy <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> them." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{learning}} that Fannin was not coming {{and that there}} would likely be no other reinforcements, a group of 25 men set out from Gonzales at 2 pm on Saturday, February 27.

King {{on their way out}} of town his fifteen-year-old son, Wiliam, rushed out and asked to take his father's place, as John King was needed to support the family's nine children. [...] The men agreed, and William exchanged places with his father. On the march to Bexar eight additional men joined the group.

2500|$|Traditional Jews {{commonly}} practice [...] "ma'aser kesafim," [...] tithing 10% {{of their}} income to support those in need.

They did not expect a supernatural savior to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> care of the poor, and so they held that one must not make oneself poor. [...] Given that nearly all Jews of their day were poor or middle-class (even the rich of that time were only rich relative to the poor), they ruled that one should not give away more than a fifth of his income to charity, while yet being obligated to give away no less than 10% of his income to charity.|$|E
