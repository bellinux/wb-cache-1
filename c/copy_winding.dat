40|$|The D 1 D 5 CFT {{has been}} very useful {{in the study of}} black holes. The {{interaction}} in this theory involves a twist operator, which links together different copies of a free CFT. For the bosonic fields, we examine the action of this twist when it links together CFT <b>copies</b> with <b>winding</b> numbers M and N to produce a <b>copy</b> with <b>winding</b> M + N. Starting with the vacuum state generates a squeezed state, which we compute. Starting with an initial excitation on one of the copies gives a linear combination of excitations on the final state, which we also compute. These results generalize earlier computations where these quantities were computed for the special case M = N = 1. Our results should help in understanding the thermalization process in the D 1 D 5 CFT, which gives the dual of black hole formation in the bulk...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of Gribov copies {{is a central}} feature of the field configuration space of confining gauge theories. In particular a transition between two Gribov <b>copies</b> with relative <b>winding</b> number implies a space-time configuration with topological charge. We explicitly demonstrate the proliferation of Gribov <b>copies</b> with relative <b>winding</b> number, where our focus is on localized (finite norm) configurations in Coulomb gauge. We then discuss the likelihood that some pairs of such copies are connected by Minkowski space solutions. We also comment on {{the relative importance of}} instantons and the connection to confinement. ...|$|R
40|$|The D 1 D 5 CFT gives a {{holographic}} dual {{description of}} a near-extremal black hole in string theory. The interaction in this theory is given by a marginal deformation operator, which is composed of supercharges acting on a twist operator. The twist operator links together different copies of a free CFT. We study {{the effect of this}} deformation operator when it links together CFT <b>copies</b> with <b>winding</b> numbers M and N to produce a <b>copy</b> with <b>winding</b> M + N, populated with excitations of a particular form. We compute the effect of the deformation operator in the full supersymmetric theory, firstly on a Ramond-Ramond ground state and secondly on states with an initial bosonic or fermionic excitation. Our results generalize recent work which studied only the bosonic sector of the CFT. Our findings are a step towards understanding thermalization in the D 1 D 5 CFT, which is related to black hole formation and evaporation in the bulk...|$|R

This thesis uncovered seven friendship group-level motives for alcohol consumption, these motives were: Competition, <b>Copying,</b> Commitments, Conformity, <b>Winding</b> down, Play, and Confidence. These motives were then measured and their correlation with self-reported alcohol consumption was assessed. Using these results will allow social marketers to design targeted programmes that achieve meaningful behaviour change that goes beyond merely informing or raising awareness {{about the dangers of}} alcohol...|$|R

By comparison, 30,264 <b>copies</b> of The <b>Wind</b> Waker HD were sold in its first week in Japan. Twilight Princess HDs sales dropped 84% in its second week in the U.K., making it the ninth best-selling game in the country. In the United States, it was the third best-selling game sold in brick-and-mortar retailers throughout March 2016, according to market-research firm The NPD Group.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe D 1 D 5 CFT is a {{holographic}} dual of a near-extremal {{black hole}} in string theory. The interaction in this theory involves a twist operator which joins together different copies of a free CFT. Given {{a large number of}} D 1 and D 5 branes, the effective length of the circle on which the CFT lives is very large. We develop a technique to study the effect of the twist operator in the limit where the wavelengths of excitations are short compared to this effective length, which we call the ‘continuum limit’. The method uses Bogoliubov coefficients to compute the effect of the twist operator in this limit. For bosonic fields, we use the method to reproduce recent results describing the effect of the twist operator when it links together CFT copies with windings M and N, producing a <b>copy</b> of <b>winding</b> M+N. We also comment on possible generalizations of our results. The methods developed here may help in understanding the twist interaction at higher orders. This in turn should provide insight into the thermalization process in the D 1 D 5 CFT, which gives a holographic description of black hole formation...|$|R
50|$|Ocarina of Time was re-released on the GameCube in 2002, when it {{was offered}} as a pre-order {{incentive}} for The Wind Waker in the U.S., Canada and Japan. Europe continued to receive it free in every <b>copy</b> of The <b>Wind</b> Waker, except for the discounted Player's Choice version. It includes what is widely {{believed to be the}} remnants of a cancelled 64DD expansion for Ocarina of Time known as Ura Zelda in early development. Named Ocarina of Time Master Quest, the game was given the addition of revamped, more difficult dungeon layouts. Ocarina of Time was included as part of the Collector's Edition for the GameCube in 2003. It is now available through the Wii's Virtual Console service. In 2011, Nintendo released {{a new version of the}} game in stereoscopic 3D for the Nintendo 3DS titled The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D. In July 2015, Nintendo rereleased it for the Wii U Virtual Console.|$|R
