[...] The concept of <b>consent</b> has been operationalized in several major contexts, including in law, medicine and sexual relationships.

25|$|The term <b>consent</b> is {{typically}} {{defined as a}} subject adhering to an agreement of principals and regulations; however, the definition becomes difficult to execute concerning the topic of organ donation, mainly because the subject is incapable of <b>consent</b> due to death or mental impairment. There {{are two types of}} <b>consent</b> being reviewed; explicit <b>consent</b> and presumed <b>consent.</b> Explicit <b>consent</b> consists of the donor giving direct <b>consent</b> through proper registration depending on the country. The second <b>consent</b> process is presumed <b>consent,</b> which does not need direct <b>consent</b> from the donor or the next of kin. Presumed <b>consent</b> assumes that donation would have been permitted by the potential donor if permission was pursued. Of possible donors an estimated twenty-five percent of families refuse to donate a loved one's organs. <b>Consent</b> is defined as adhering to an agreement of principals. However, this definition is hard to enforce in accordance with organ donation because, in most cases, organs are donated from the deceased, and can no longer provide <b>consent</b> for themselves.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{the nature of}} <b>consent</b> in general, and {{as it applies to}} Carlos Nino’s consensual theory of punishment. For Nino the criminal’s <b>consent</b> to change her legal-normative status is a form of implied <b>consent.</b> I {{distinguish}} three types of implied consent: 1) implied <b>consent</b> which is based on an operative convention (i. e. tacit consent); 2) implied <b>consent</b> where there is no operative convention; 3) “direct consent” to the legal-normative consequences of a proscribed act – this is the <b>consent</b> which Nino employs. I argue that Nino’s conception of <b>consent</b> in crime exhibits many common features of “everyday” <b>consent,</b> which justify that it be classed as a form of (implied) <b>consent.</b> h us, Nino is right to claim that the <b>consent</b> in crime is similar to the <b>consent</b> in contracts and to the <b>consent</b> to assume a risk in tort law...|$|R

40|$|How {{does the}} law {{construct}} <b>consent?</b> This Article explores {{this question in}} the context of Supreme Court decisions regarding third-party <b>consent</b> to searches of dwellings. Using textual analysis, a method rarely used in Fourth Amendment law, this Article argues that the Supreme Court employs an a-contextual and gender-blind analysis of <b>consent</b> that is insensitive to power dynamics. Using the feminist scholarship on <b>consent,</b> this Article critiques the notion of <b>consent</b> as developed by the Supreme Court. At the same time it rejects the feminist redefinition of <b>consent</b> as vague and unclear. This Article proposes that the third-party <b>consent</b> to search doctrine involves a triangular relation between the police officer, the <b>consenting</b> third-party, and the suspect. Accordingly, this Article explores each edge of the triangle. This triangular relation analysis shows that the problematic notion of <b>consent</b> is more acute in third-party <b>consent</b> cases than in other consensual search cases. Thus, this Article proposes the abolition of the third-party <b>consent</b> to search doctrine...|$|R

On Vulcan, after a tense homecoming, she learns that her mother has resigned from the Vulcan Science Academy as indirect punishment for T'Pol's actions at the P'Jem sanctuary. One logical way for T'Pol to restore her mother's position is to honor her engagement to Koss, a member of an influential family.

Corrales leads her to Bobby Chombo, an expert in geospatial technologies who handles Corrales' technical requirements.

5|$|The film {{focuses on}} Jack Goodwin, a young {{chemistry}} {{student who has}} discovered a novel compound that allows a person {{to be put in}} a state of sleep for any length of time. The compound causes an effect similar to suspended animation, with no ill-effects or bodily changes. Jack tests the compound on himself for a period of a week and desires to test it for a century. In preparation for this, he obtains a safety deposit vault and provides instructions to be presented before the mayor in a hundred years. Jack's experiment works and he awakes in the year 2010 to a very different future. Transportation has been radically changed to pneumatic tubes allowing him to be transported to the mayor. The woman mayor takes an interest in him and invites her over to her home. In the intervening years, the world has become ruled by women and Jack is now out of place, but the two fall in love. Her father is an advocate for men's rights and Jack joins their society. The group soon appears before the mayor and she sends all of them to jail through the pneumatic tube, except for Jack. She proposes to him, but Jack only <b>consents</b> if the rights of men would be granted. The mayor is true to her word and signs a decree to give the men their liberty. During the ceremony, she attempts to lead Jack to the altar, but Jack shows her that the man must lead. When the bridal veil is placed on Jack, he places it on his new wife.|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on three {{scenarios}} in which residual biological materials are turned into research collections during the procedure of procuring these materials for diagnostic, therapeutic or other non-research purposes. These three scenarios differ from each other primarily because they employ different models of consent: (a) precautionary <b>consent,</b> which may be secured during the collecting procedure; (b) the presumed <b>consent</b> model, which may be applied during the collection of materials; and (c) <b>consent</b> for research use of identifiable human biological materials, which may be skipped entirely. These scenarios offer additional sources of biological samples for research purposes {{and at the same}} time seem to offer even more flexibility in terms of stringency of <b>consent</b> as compared with the more traditional models of broad <b>consent</b> in prospective research collections and the waiver of <b>consent</b> in retrospective research. Our discussion leads us to think that precautionary <b>consent</b> is preferable to presumed <b>consent</b> and no <b>consent</b> when handling issues of <b>consent</b> in the use of residual human biological materials for research.
