25|$|The first type of JFET was {{the static}} {{induction}} transistor (SIT), invented by Japanese engineers Jun-ichi Nishizawa and Y. Watanabe in 1950. The SIT {{is a type of}} JFET with a short <b>channel</b> <b>length.</b> The metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), which largely superseded the JFET and {{had a profound effect on}} digital electronic development, was invented by Dawon Kahng and Martin Atalla in 1959.|$|E
25|$|The city of Ibadan is {{naturally}} drained by four rivers with many tributaries: Ona River in the North and West; Ogbere River towards the East; Ogunpa River {{flowing through the}} city and Kudeti River in the Central part of the metropolis. Ogunpa River, a third-order stream with a <b>channel</b> <b>length</b> of 12.76km and a catchment area of 54.92km2. Lake Eleyele {{is located at the}} northwestern part of the city, while the Osun River and the Asejire Lake bounds the city to the east.|$|E
25|$|As the <b>channel</b> <b>length</b> {{becomes very}} short, these {{equations}} become quite inaccurate. New physical effects arise. For example, carrier transport {{in the active}} mode may become limited by velocity saturation. When velocity saturation dominates, the saturation drain current is more nearly linear than quadratic in VGS. At even shorter lengths, carriers transport with near zero scattering, known as quasi-ballistic transport. In the ballistic regime, the carriers travel at an injection velocity that may exceed the saturation velocity and approaches the Fermi velocity at high inversion charge density. In addition, drain-induced barrier lowering increases off-state (cutoff) current and requires an increase in threshold voltage to compensate, which in turn reduces the saturation current.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} {{was to develop a}} robust and {{efficient}} numerical solution of the hydrodynamic model, which solves the energy balance equation, and to compare predictions of this model, using one set of parameters, with experimental nMOSFET characteristics for a range of <b>channel</b> <b>lengths</b> down to ultrashort channels. The substrate current was calculated by direct integration of the energy distribution function, which uses the computed temperature to obtain the number of high energy electrons. The drain current calculated using this method is accurate for a range of <b>channel</b> <b>lengths</b> and biases, and correctly predicts the observed enhanced transconduct- ance for ultrashort-channel devices.

25|$|DIBL and VT roll off: Because of the short-channel effect, channel {{formation}} {{is not entirely}} done by the gate, but now the drain and source also affect the channel formation. As the <b>channel</b> <b>length</b> decreases, the depletion regions of the source and drain come closer together and make the threshold voltage (VT) {{a function of the}} length of the channel. This is called VT roll-off. VT also becomes function of drain to source voltage VDS. As we increase the VDS, the depletion regions increase in size, and a considerable amount of charge is depleted by the VDS. The gate voltage required to form the channel is then lowered, and thus, the VT decreases with an increase in VDS. This effect is called drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL).|$|E
25|$|These are diodes that {{conduct in}} the reverse {{direction}} when the reverse bias voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage. These are electrically {{very similar to}} Zener diodes (and are often mistakenly called Zener diodes), but break down by a different mechanism: the avalanche effect. This occurs when the reverse electric field applied across the p–n junction causes a wave of ionization, reminiscent of an avalanche, leading to a large current. Avalanche diodes are designed to break down at a well-defined reverse voltage without being destroyed. The difference between the avalanche diode (which has a reverse breakdown above about 6.2V) and the Zener is that the <b>channel</b> <b>length</b> of the former exceeds the mean free path of the electrons, resulting in many collisions between them on {{the way through the}} channel. The only practical difference between the two types is they have temperature coefficients of opposite polarities.|$|E
25|$|Smaller MOSFETs are {{desirable}} for several reasons. The main reason to make transistors smaller is to pack {{more and more}} devices in a given chip area. This results in a chip with the same functionality in a smaller area, or chips with more functionality in the same area. Since fabrication costs for a semiconductor wafer are relatively fixed, the cost per integrated circuits is mainly related {{to the number of}} chips that can be produced per wafer. Hence, smaller ICs allow more chips per wafer, reducing the price per chip. In fact, over the past 30 years the number of transistors per chip has been doubled every 2–3 years once a new technology node is introduced. For example, the number of MOSFETs in a microprocessor fabricated in a 45 nm technology can well be twice as many as in a 65 nm chip. This doubling of transistor density was first observed by Gordon Moore in 1965 and is commonly referred to as Moore's law. It is also expected that smaller transistors switch faster. For example, one approach to size reduction is a scaling of the MOSFET that requires all device dimensions to reduce proportionally. The main device dimensions are the <b>channel</b> <b>length,</b> channel width, and oxide thickness. When they are scaled down by equal factors, the transistor channel resistance does not change, while gate capacitance is cut by that factor. Hence, the RC delay of the transistor scales with a similar factor. While this has been traditionally the case for the older technologies, for the state-of-the-art MOSFETs reduction of the transistor dimensions does not necessarily translate to higher chip speed because the delay due to interconnections is more significant.|$|E

As seen in these figures, the number of UV photons reaching the surrounding dielectrics is higher at greater <b>channel</b> <b>lengths.</b> The total number of UV photons arriving at the surface of dielectric side-walls is an order of magnitude higher than at the dielectric anode and two orders of magnitude greater than at dielectric cathode.|$|R

Futhermore, an accurate analytical drain current model for planar diamond SOI MOSFET for micrometre scale effective <b>channel</b> <b>lengths</b> is proposed and validated. The concept is then extended by 3 D simulations for the 150 nm node fully-depleted SOI n-channel MOSFETs...|$|R
