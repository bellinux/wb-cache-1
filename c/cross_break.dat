40|$|Endemic to {{the islands}} of Sumatra and Borneo, the {{orangutan}} (genus Pongo) is endangered and approaching extinction in the wild. Pongo requires {{a large amount of}} calories and travels across extensive tracts of forest in search of food. Predominately arboreal and reluctant to <b>cross</b> <b>breaks</b> in the canopy, forest fragmentation has confined Pongo to smaller patches of forest and forced individuals to interact with conspecifics. This is of particular concern because traditionally Pongo has been understood to live a solitary existence. However, research from the last few decades reveals the orangutan social system to be far more multifaceted than previously assumed; orangutans have established relationships and interact with conspecifics frequently. The socio-ecological model explains that female and male population distribution reflects food availability and distribution. Additional evidence suggests that when provided with food, and thus relieved of the pressure to procure food, orangutans exhibit behavioral flexibility and are able to live in close proximity to conspecifics without increased aggression. I propose Pongo is a behaviorally flexible primate capable, if provisioned, of living in “mono-social” groups as a radical response to extensive habitat and population loss...|$|R

40|$|The {{electronic}} structure of DNA {{is determined by}} its nucleotide sequence, which is for instance exploited in molecular electronics. Here we demonstrate that also the DNA strand breakage induced by low-energy electrons (18 eV) depends on the nucleotide sequence. To determine the absolute cross sections for electron induced single strand breaks in specific 13 mer oligonucleotides we used atomic force microscopy analysis of DNA origami based DNA nanoarrays. We investigated the DNA sequences 5 ′-TT(XYX) 3 TT with X = A, G, C and Y = T, BrU 5 -bromouracil and found absolute strand <b>break</b> <b>cross</b> sections between 2. 66 · 10 - 14 cm 2 and 7. 06 · 10 - 14 cm 2. The highest cross section was found for 5 2 -TT(ATA) 3 TT and 5 2 -TT(ABrUA) 3 TT, respectively. BrU is a radiosensitizer, which was discussed {{to be used in}} cancer radiation therapy. The replacement of T by BrU into the investigated DNA sequences leads to a slight increase of the absolute strand <b>break</b> <b>cross</b> sections resulting in sequence-dependent enhancement factors between 1. 14 and 1. 66. Nevertheless, the variation of strand <b>break</b> <b>cross</b> sections due to the specific nucleotide sequence is considerably higher. Thus, the present results suggest the development of targeted radiosensitizers for cancer radiation therapy. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use of {{tropical}} butterflies as indicators of forest disturbance, fragmentation and forest recovery. The disturbance level of habitats {{was found to be}} characterised by the rate of the fraction of species accumulated, with species in undisturbed habitats accumulating more slowly. Undisturbed habitats, but not more disturbed ones, were found to have a vertically stratified butterfly assemblage between the forest understorey and canopy, and certain species were found to be horizontally stratified from the forest edge. No significant effect of breaks in a forest habitat to the dispersal of certain fruit-feeding butterflies was found, but for species which did not <b>cross</b> <b>breaks,</b> {{it was not possible to}} determine whether this was due to low numbers of captures or because breaks acted as barriers to dispersal. Cissia arnaea (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae) was present in significantly greatest abundance in 30 year selectively logged forest, even though canopy openness was not significantly different from that found in 5 year forest. Conversely, Colobura dirce (Nymphalidae: Nymphalinae) was found in greatest abundance in the O and 5 year forest and least abundant in the 30 year forest. It is possible that these species could be used to indicate forest recovery following selective logging. Population size estimates and average residency rates were calculated for Cissia penelop e and Morpho peleides from fruit trap data. Community structure in the Cissia genus was explored, and the relationship between local abundance and geographic range size investigated and certain restricted range species were not found to be adversely affected by forest disturbance in Trinidad as expected (Thomas 1991 and Hamer et al. 1997) ...|$|R
