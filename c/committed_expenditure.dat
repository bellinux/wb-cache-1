The author identifies five basic fears in humans: fear of being rejected, abandoned, humiliated, betrayed and the victim of an injustice. The stock market investor is confronted with the following fears: the disposition effect, the hedonistic approach, the effect of the <b>committed</b> <b>expenditure,</b> the snake bite effect, the dismissal of any regret (or the no regret approach), the status quo prejudice and the endowment effect. The author shows that the stock investor’s seven fears are specific cases of the five basic fears. The first step in confronting these fears is to become aware of the mask worn...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Sharp {{deterioration}} in state finance {{during the last}} decade has been a matter of serious concern to policy makers in India. The {{deterioration in}} State finance is largely an outcome of {{the fact that in the}} fact of a limited resource-base the states had to cope with a significant growth in their <b>committed</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Correcting the fiscal imbalances today is the single most important object of the new economic policy in India. The crucial issue therefore is to bring out improvement in State finance with a view to restructuring the expenditure in favour of development expenditure in order to enable a higher growth. The states took policy measures which helped them to avoid further worsening of their fiscal position to some extent. The Thirteenth Finance Commission has set a target of reducing fiscal deficit to 3 % of GDP for States latest by 2014 - 15. The present study attempts to bring out the emerging trends in state finances of India in recent years...|$|E

A recent economic analysis estimates that costs of control and yield loss are about $ 1. 17 billion a year in the United States. Crop rotation and chemical control have been the primary management strategies, but the western corn rootworm is becoming increasingly difficult to control because of its sequential ability to evolve resistance to almost all management strategies that have been used. The recent deployment of transgenic Bt corn in the United States for controlling Diabrotica pests has raised concerns that rootworms will develop resistance to this technology as well, unless appropriate resistance management strategies are developed and practiced...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper has been to extend the range of {{consequences}} implied by government regulation of privately owned firms. The analytical framework of Section II concentrated on deriving the implications of alternative degrees of regulation on the firm 2 ̆ 7 s research and development (R 2 ̆ 6 D) decisions. The analysis implies that managers of stringently regulated firms have greater incentive to neglect such activities related to the search for and production of valuable market information which increases owners 2 ̆ 7 wealth. Among other things, this implies that firms subject to more restrictive regulatory climates are more likely to <b>commit</b> fewer <b>expenditures</b> to R 2 ̆ 6 D activities. Empirical evidence from the electric power industry was presented in Section III. The results indicate that the interfirm differences in R 2 ̆ 6 D expenditures in this industry can be explained to a large extent by the variability of governmentally imposed regulatory constraints. After controlling for other determinants of R 2 ̆ 6 D behavior, the evidence reveals that electric power firms subject to the most restrictive regulatory constraints do significantly (at the 5 percent level and better) less R 2 ̆ 6 D than firms operating under the weakest regulatory constraints...|$|R

Due to this increased interest, current research into aging demonstrates it as a complex process that is the result of interplay between naturally occurring processes, such as changes in hormonal levels and gene transcription that occur during the biological timeline of human development, and the exposure of our body’s systems to environmental damage [2]. At a physiological level, aging is the functional decay overtime of cells, organs and tissues, specifically through chemical damage of the cellular components proteins, DNA and lipids.

40|$|This paper reviews budget {{expenditure}} {{trends in}} Tamil Nadu {{and the key}} indicators of fiscal performance, during the period 1980 / 81 - 1998 / 99. The review indicates the emergence of large and persistent current and fiscal deficits from 1987 / 88. Revenue financed expenditures have grown rapidly as successive five year plans have led to increasing magnitudes of <b>committed</b> non-plan development <b>expenditure.</b> Plan expenditures in the current budget are also quite substantial in Tamil Nadu. The rising current account deficits coupled with large annual increases on wages and subsidies have emerged as major structural problems in the budget. Currently, a very {{large proportion of the}} current budget is allocated to wages, interest payments, subsidies and grants making it extremely difficult to bring about any realignment of expenditures. The trends in debt/SGDP ratio are also reviewed as well as the recent increases in the average cost of financing the deficits. Using a simple analytical framework, this paper then analyzes the sustainability of the government's fiscal stance taking into account the magneto of annual debt flows into the budget.

40|$|The {{road network}} is {{extremely}} valuable. Road Administrationsare expected to invest maintenance funding {{in a way}} thatreturns maximum benefit to road users. Cost-benefit analysis isone method to ensure that an adequate return in terms ofbenefits results from <b>committing</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Today,cost-benefit calculations are frequently used as a base fordecision making of investments. The surges for such methods inthe maintenance management sector are increasing. Up to the present, one reason for not analysing costs andbenefits for various maintenance management measures has beenthe {{lack of knowledge about}} comfort benefits for road users inquantitative monetary terms. The aim with this thesis is toinvestigate motorists 9 ̆ 2 apprehension of pavementmaintenance management and winter maintenance operations. Thefinal goal is to find out their willingness to pay fordifferent levels of road maintenance management. Those valuescan later be used in cost-benefit calculations and also ineffect models of road maintenance management. Due to the pioneer status of this study, focus groups andin-depth interviews {{as well as a number}} of pilot studies havebeen carried out before a main survey with stated choiceexperiments could be designed. These exploratory studies showedthat the interviewees were familiar with the types of roadsurface damage that exist and in many cases mastered the sameterminology as the Road Administration and others. Showingpictures of well-known types of road damage lead to highermonetary valuations of getting better road standard incomparison with just text descriptions. One reason for thatcould be the requisite severness of the damage in order toillustrate a certain road maintenance shortage. The respondentswith the text descriptions could have stated their preferencesfor an, in their own minds, average shortcoming while the groupwith access to photograph of road damage all saw the samesevere damage. Illustrations of different road maintenancestandards make it possible to control the respondentsinterpretation of the maintenance management standard valuatedbut could lead to high monetary estimations. Driving comfort was very important to the interviewees inthe exploratory studies. That was manifested in the pilotstated choice surveys, which resulted in high willingness topay for better pavement management. The main study consisted of two surveys; the first one wasabout pavement maintenance management and was carried out inOctober to November 2000 and the second one took place inFebruary to March 2001 and was about winter maintenanceoperations. Both the pavement and the winter survey includedattitude questions and two stated choice experiments. Theresult showed that the maintenance management status of theroad network was important to car users. For example, the worstpavement damage was roughness; the motorists were willing topay 1. 7 SEK (Swedish Crowns) per kilometre to avoid roadsdamaged in their full length. The least harmful damage of thosestudied was cracks; the willingness to pay to avoid that was 0. 5 SEK per kilometre. For more rapid snow clearance, the carusers were willing to pay 60 to 80 SEK per year for getting theroads cleared from snow one hour earlier than the currentstandard implies. The willingness to pay for driving on bareroads in comparison with snow roads was 0. 4 SEK per kilometre. Statistical tests on the models showed that the parametervalueswere well estimated. In the pavement as well as in the winter survey, a clustergroup analysis was performed in order to test the heterogeneityof attitudes and behaviour to road maintenance management. Theanalysis resulted in two separate groups in each survey. Onegroup consisted of drivers who reported to be very influencedby the level of maintenance management regarding chosen speed,joy of driving and so on. The other group reported to be lessinfluenced and had lower acceptance of higher road tax for thepurpose to increase the maintenance management standard. Separate stated choice models revealed that the differences inattitudes could also reflect the respondents 9 ̆ 2 willingnessto pay for higher road maintenance standard. However, thedifferences were only small and the different groups 9 ̆ 2 monetary valuations were not found to be significantlydifferent from each other. The result of this study, better knowledge aboutmotorists 9 ̆ 2 apprehension of maintenance management, theirattitudes to driving comfort and road standard and theirmonetary valuations of different levels of pavement maintenanceand winter maintenance operations, opens up the possibility tomake cost-benefit analysis of various maintenance managementprojects.

40|$|Angela Beaton and Lesley Russell {{introduce}} {{their analysis}} of the 2009 - 10 state and territory health budgets THE GLOBAL financial crisis {{has been good for}} health {{in the sense that it}} has provoked the state and territory governments to inject capital into health infrastructure. But this major investment needs to be balanced with provisions to ensure that needed health services are there for the vulnerable and disadvantaged groups that are feeling the pinch in this economic downturn.    Generally speaking, the marked investment in health infrastructure in all state and territory budgets, which includes the development and upgrade of metropolitan and regional hospitals, emergency departments, and the purchase of various bits of high-tech medical equipment, will help to improve health care services for many Australians.    While there is a clear emphasis in all of the state and territory budgets on creating and sustaining jobs, provisions for prevention and indigenous health services seem to be secondary considerations. This is surprising given the increased emphasis on these issues and the national partnerships between the Commonwealth and state governments that are now in place to address them. These partnerships require that the states and territories provide funds for preventive health and Indigenous health ($ 772 million over four years).   It is not at all clear that these funds have been <b>committed</b> and their <b>expenditure</b> is underway.  Services for disadvantaged groups and issues around prevention surely become even more important at a time when people may be forced to choose cheaper, less nutritious foods and when a visit to the dentist is well down on the list of a family’s priorities. This highlights the importance of achieving real change in these areas by taking a more integrated and comprehensive approach, facilitated by the national partnerships, and backed up by shared accountability, better performance reporting and greater budget transparency.  • An analysis of state and territory health commitments against the National Partnership commitments agreed through the COAG process is available from the Menzies Centre for Health Policy website.  Angela Beaton is a researcher at the Menzies Centre for Health Policy, University of Sydney / Australian National University.
