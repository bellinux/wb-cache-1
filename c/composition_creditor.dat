5000|$|A <b>Composition</b> with <b>Creditors</b> is an {{agreement}} among several creditors of a debtor, usually a business. Usually, the agreement involves paying a lessened amount {{over a period}} of time.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} need to {{encourage}} awareness of the legislation that already exists. This would enable businesses in difficulty to consider their options at the earliest possible opportunity. Such options may, depending on the circumstances, include entering into a formal or informal <b>composition</b> with <b>creditors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bankruptcies can be annulled {{prior to}} the {{expiration}} of the normal three-year period if all debts are paid out in full. Sometimes a bankrupt {{may be able to}} raise enough funds to make an Offer of <b>Composition</b> to <b>creditors,</b> which would have the effect of paying the creditors some of the money they are owed. If the creditors accept the offer, the bankruptcy can be annulled after the funds are received.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} impact of the <b>composition</b> of <b>creditors</b> on the {{probability}} of default and the corresponding default risk premium on sovereign bonds, when there are enforcement problems and debtor moral hazard. We show that concentrated market structures are associated with a lower default probability and lower default risk premia, except when the country is faced with very productive investment opportunities. A higher fraction of large creditors leads to the use of long term contracts that better discipline debtor countries...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the bank}} {{initially}} survived the financial turmoil in late 2008, Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland (FME) assumed control of Straumur on 9 March 2009. The new owners successfully completed its composition in summer 2010, {{first of the}} collapsed Icelandic banks, with over 99% of ALMC’s <b>creditors</b> approving the <b>composition.</b> Along with the <b>composition</b> ALMC's <b>creditors</b> approved on founding Straumur Investment Bank. In summer 2011, Straumur became the first entity to get a banking license in Iceland post the financial turmoil in fall 2008.|$|R
40|$|The main {{motivation}} {{of this paper}} is to study the impact of the <b>composition</b> of <b>creditors</b> on the probability of default and the corresponding default risk premium on sovereign bonds, when there is debtor moral hazard. In the absence of any legal enforcement, relational contracts work only when there are creditors who have a repeated relationship with the borrower. We show that ownership structures with a larger fraction of long term lenders are associated with a lower default probability and lower risk premia, except when the country is faced with very productive investment opportunities...|$|R

5000|$|That {{was not the}} end of the story. Brerewood fled to Livorno, Italy, {{where his}} {{creditors}} found him in December 1707 and at great expense hauled him back to London to stand trial. He was convicted in the London criminal court in March 1709 of “Defrauding Mr. Pitkins Creditors, and Absconding contrary to an Act of Parliament made on his Account” and sentenced as the statute against him required. Yet by November he had been freed on a royal pardon after having compounded with Pitkin’s creditors to pay an extra one shilling six pence in the pound over the original agreement. The London Gazette, Nov. 3, 1709, announced a <b>composition</b> with Pitkin <b>creditors,</b> who petitioned for the Pardon [...] of Thomas Brerewood (1709) requesting pardon by Queen in exchange for additional payment by Brerewood.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Micawber's affairs, {{although}} {{past their}} crisis, {{were very much}} involved by reason of a certain 'Deed', of which I used to hear a great deal, and which I suppose, now, to have been some former <b>composition</b> with his <b>creditors,</b> though I was so far from being clear about it then, that I am conscious of having confounded it with those demoniacal parchments which are held to have, once upon a time, obtained {{to a great extent}} in Germany. At last this document appeared to be got out of the way, somehow; at all events it ceased to be the rock-ahead it had been; and Mrs. Micawber informed me that 'her family' had decided that Mr. Micawber should apply for his release under the Insolvent Debtors Act, which would set him free, she expected, in about six weeks.|$|R
50|$|Brerewood did {{not give}} up so easily. Although the {{creditors}} identified him as an accomplice and the House of Lords ordered him taken into custody in early March 1705, he still managed to salvage {{part of the original}} scam by hiring an attorney, George Wilcocks, to negotiate a <b>composition</b> with Pitkin’s <b>creditors.</b> Wilcocks assured the creditors “that 8 shillings 6 pence in the Pound (£) was the utmost that Brerewood’s Estate would reach to pay,” and thereby convinced them all to sign a composition in September 1705. But the creditors eventually got wind of the fact that Brerewood held much more of the stolen assets than he had let on, and they obtained a parliamentary act against him in April 1707, making, despite the previous composition, his entire estate liable to Pitkin’s debts on pain of life imprisonment and pillorying three times a year.|$|R
50|$|Frederick Woodward Branson {{was born}} on 6 March 1851 at Hanslope, Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, England. He {{was the son of}} Thomas Branson a bricklayer, who later became a farmer. Branson's father {{inherited}} the farm via his marriage to Sarah Ann née Woodward, who had inherited it from her father. In 1861, Branson lived with his parents and maternal grandparents, William Woodward an agricultural laborer and farm owner, at Hungate End Farm, Hanslope. The farm consisted of 168 acres and employed 6 men and 6 boys. William inherited when he married Mary Woodward née Prentice, who was left half of her father, Thomas Prentice, Yeoman's, estate on 31 October 1837 located in Hanslope, Buckinghamshire, England. By 1861, the farm had increased in size to 200 acres and the farm was passed on to Branson's father, Thomas, around 1869 when William Woodward died. The farm increased in size again to 212 acres by 1871. At this time, Branson was employed as a chemist's apprentice, in the pharmacy of Messrs. Jay in the Drapery at All Saints, Northampton where he served his indentures. Branson would have inherited Hungate End farm via his parents, unfortunately, his mother Sarah Ann, the natural farmer by birth died, on 9 March 1881. She was the driving force and the decision maker {{when it came to the}} farm's success, whereas his father's experience came from a building background rather than a farming one. A notice in The London Gazette, 26 March 1881, announced that Thomas Branson had been declared bankrupt, and that Hungate End Farm, Hanslope was to be liquidated by arrangement by <b>Composition</b> with <b>Creditors</b> in accordance with the 1869 bankruptcy act. It is noted that by 1891, Branson's father had returned to the building trade. He died in 1910 and Branson attended his fathers funeral.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Moore, indeed, was {{but half}} a Briton, and {{scarcely}} that. He came {{of a foreign}} ancestry by the mother's side, and was himself born and partly reared on a foreign soil. A hybrid in nature, it is probable he had a hybrid's feeling on many points--patriotism for one; {{it is likely that}} he was unapt to attach himself to parties, to sects, even to climes and customs; it is not impossible that he had a tendency to isolate his individual person from any community amidst which his lot might temporarily happen to be thrown, and that he felt it to be his best wisdom to push the interests of Robert Gérard Moore, to the exclusion of philanthropic consideration for general interests, with which he regarded the said Gérard Moore as in a great measure disconnected. Trade was Mr. Moore's hereditary calling: the Gérards of Antwerp had been merchants for two centuries back. Once they had been wealthy merchants; but the uncertainties, the involvements, of business had come upon them; disastrous speculations had loosened by degrees the foundations of their credit. The house had stood on a tottering base for a dozen years; and at last, in the shock of the French Revolution, it had rushed down a total ruin. In its fall was involved the English and Yorkshire firm of Moore, closely connected with the Antwerp house, and of which one of the partners, resident in Antwerp, Robert Moore, had married Hortense Gérard, with the prospect of his bride inheriting her father Constantine Gérard's share in the business. She inherited, as we have seen, but his share in the liabilities of the firm; and these liabilities, though duly set aside by a <b>composition</b> with <b>creditors,</b> some said her son Robert accepted, in his turn, as a legacy, and that he aspired one day to discharge them, and to rebuild the fallen house of Gérard and Moore on a scale at least equal to its former greatness. It was even supposed that he took by-past circumstances much to heart; and if a childhood passed at the side of a saturnine mother, under foreboding of coming evil, and a manhood drenched and blighted by the pitiless descent of the storm, could painfully impress the mind, his probably was impressed in no golden characters.|$|R
