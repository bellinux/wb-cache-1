40|$|This paper {{examines}} the pollution control policies applied in China¡¯s paper industry {{during the period}} of economic reform from 1982 to 1992. The paper industry is the source of ten percent of China¡¯s industrial wastewater emissions and one-fourth of its chemical oxygen demand. It is the largest source of rural environmental pollution. The very small size of China¡¯s mills is comparable to that of papermills in many developing countries and this small size itself creates an interesting problem. Modern pollution control technologies were created for much larger and more capital intensive facilities like those in North American and Northern Europe. Therefore, adoption of the best technology is not a simple matter of technology transfer. We used mill-level production and pollution data to estimate (1) the effect of China¡¯s system of pollution <b>control</b> <b>levies</b> on three environmental effluents, and then (2) examined further the effect of this system of levies on the technical efficiency of mill-level production. Our results show that the pollution levies worked for those larger establishments that were the main targets of reform policies in this period. They decreased the production of effluents by causing managers to alter their mix of productive inputs, but the levies were not large enough to induce the purchase of modern pollution <b>control</b> technologies. The <b>levies</b> had an efficiency improving effect on most modern mills and also on those mills that subsequently discontinued operation. Nevertheless, we observed opportunity for further improvements in efficiency, notably through increased labor productivity. This is consistent with the government¡¯s recent decision to relax its policy of employment protection for workers in state-owned mills. Although we found no evidence of scale economies in production, we did observe that smaller mills were less efficient. This observation is consistent with the government¡¯s more recent decision to close the most environmentally offending small mills.

50|$|The small Druze sect, {{strategically}} and dangerously {{seated on}} the Chouf in central Lebanon, had no natural allies, and so were compelled to put much effort into building alliances. Under {{the leadership of the}} Jumblatt family, first Kamal Jumblatt (the LNM leader) and then his son Walid, the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) (Arabic: الحزب التقدمي الاشتراكي, al-hizb al-taqadummi al-ishtiraki) served as an effective Druze militia, building excellent ties to the Soviet Union mainly, and with Syria upon the withdrawal of Israel to the south of the country. However, many Druze in Lebanon at the time were members of the non-religious party, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. Under Kamal Jumblatt's leadership, the PSP was a major element in the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) which supported Lebanon's Arab identity and sympathized with the Palestinians. It built a powerful private army, which proved {{to be one of the}} strongest in the Lebanese Civil War of 1975 to 1990. It conquered much of Mount Lebanon and the Chouf District. Its main adversaries were the Maronite Christian Phalangist militia, and later the Lebanese Forces militia (which absorbed the Phalangists).

40|$|AbstractThere is {{a long-standing}} debate over price vs. {{quantity}} approaches to supporting {{the deployment of}} renewable electricity technologies. In {{the context of a}} recent shift from quantity to price-based support, the UK has also introduced a new form of budgetary framework, the <b>Levy</b> <b>Control</b> Framework (LCF). The introduction of the LCF has been very important for investors but has received relatively little attention in the academic literature. The paper gives an overview of the LCF, explores its effects on renewables policy, on consumers and on investor confidence arguing that an unintended consequence of its introduction has been to increase uncertainty, through interactions with underlying support mechanisms. A number of problems with the current scope and design of the LCF are noted. It is argued that the LCF is best understood as aimed at avoiding a political backlash against renewable support policy in a context where the benefits of such policy are concentrated economically and socially. The paper concludes by placing the LCF within a wider context of a shift towards greater budgetary control over renewable energy support policy across European countries...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of argument-head distance in SVO and SOV languages (Spanish and German), while taking into account readers’ working memory capacity and <b>controlling</b> for expectation (<b>Levy,</b> 2008) and other factors. We predicted only locality effects, that is, a slow-down produced by increased dependency distance (Gibson, 2000; Lewis & Vasishth, 2005). Furthermore, we expected stronger locality effects for readers with low working memory capacity. Contrary to our predictions, low-capacity readers showed faster reading with increased distance, while high-capacity readers showed locality effects. We suggest that while the locality effects are compatible with memory-based explanations, the speedup of low-capacity readers can be explained by an increased probability of retrieval failure. We present a computational model based on ACT-R built under the previous assumptions, which is able to give a qualitative account for the present data and can be tested in future research. Our results suggest that in some cases, interpreting longer RTs as indexing increased processing difficulty and shorter RTs as facilitation may be too simplistic: The same increase in processing difficulty may lead to slowdowns in high-capacity readers and speedups in low-capacity ones. Ignoring individual level capacity differences when investigating locality effects may lead to misleading conclusions...|$|R
