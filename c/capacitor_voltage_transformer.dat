40|$|Abstract—The {{proliferation}} of HVDC links in high voltage transmission {{systems and the}} growth of large industrial customers (with large non-linear loads) are increasing the need for harmonic distortion voltage measurements at transmission voltages.

40|$|Abstract [...] Coupling <b>capacitor</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>transformers</b> (CCVT) {{are widely}} used in power systems {{and the failure of}} this {{equipment}} may result unexpected outages of transmission lines (TL). This study shows that switching-off shunt reactor compensated TL may lead to sustained voltage amplification in the secondary of the CCVT, the product of a transient interaction between the TL and CCVT, which causes thermal and dielectric stress to its components. This interaction is chiefly influenced by the design of the CCVT and the TL-compensation degree, as assessed by means of frequency response mappings, measurements of several parameters of different designs of CCVT, and computer simulations. Besides, this investigation presents proposals to minimize damages in the CCVT and shows digital records of the Companhia Hidro Elétrica do São Francisco (CHESF) transmission systems, which illustrate the existence of such a phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Technological {{improvements}} and energy exchange between and within electrical systems require more availability and reliability, {{and the use}} of communication channels and measuring devices helps to achieve this goal. Coupling <b>Capacitor</b> <b>Voltage</b> <b>Transformers</b> (CCVTs) traditionally have been essential for power systems communications using Power Line Carrier (PLC), and its design normally includes a protection to prevent ferroresonance phenomenon. However, CCVTs failures due to environmental conditions and their lack of accuracy for energy billing led some electrical companies like the Mexican company Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) to gradual replacement of CCVT devices by the Inductive <b>Voltage</b> <b>Transformers</b> (IVT), which are installed now in busbars of electrical substations. In addition to satisfy communications PLCs were replaced by the optical fiber communications. As IVT devices do not have anti ferroresonance elements, ferroresonance phenomenon started to appear more frequently during operation maneuvers in several electrical substations. This paper presents background on CCVT explosions, patterns of behavior before failures, Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) records for system effects, measurements and simulation of typical ferroresonance occurrences. Ferroresonance mitigation techniques and possible protection schemes are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Power {{systems are}} {{protected}} by numerical relays that detect and isolate faults that may occur on power systems. The correct operation of the relay {{is very important to}} maintain the security of the power system. Numerical relays that use voltage measurements from the power system provided by coupling <b>capacitor</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>transformers</b> (CCVT) have sometimes difficulty in correctly identifying a fault in the protected area. The fundamental frequency voltage phasor resulting from these CCVT measurements may result in a deviation from the true value and therefore may locate this phasor temporarily in the incorrect operating region. This phasor deviation is due to the CCVT behavior and the CCVT introduces spurious decaying and oscillating transient signal components on top of the original voltage received from the power system in response to sudden voltage changes produced during faults. Most of the existing methods for estimating the voltage phasor do not take advantage of the knowledge of the CCVT behavior that can be obtained from its design parameters. A new least squares error method for phasor estimation is presented in this thesis, which improves the accuracy and speed of convergence of the phasors obtained, using the knowledge of the CCVT behavior. The characteristics of the transient signal components introduced by the CCVT, such as frequencies and time constants of decay, are included in the description of the curve to be fitted, which is required in a least squares fitting technique. Parameters such as window size and sampling rate for optimum results are discussed. The method proposed is evaluated using typical power systems, with results that can be compared to the response if an ideal potential transformer (PT) were used instead of a CCVT. The limitations of this method are found in some specific power system scenarios, where the natural frequencies of the power system are close to that of the CCVT, but with longer time constants. The accuracy with which the CCVT parameters are known is also assessed, with results that show little impact compared to the improvements achievable...|$|R

30|$|In this work, a {{directional}} relaying {{algorithm is}} proposed for transmission line to prevent relay maloperation during coupling <b>capacitor</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>transformer</b> (CCVT) subsidence transient. The effect of CCVT subsidence transient during single-pole-tripping condition is highlighted in this paper. The proposed method {{which is based on}} phase angle difference of post fault and prefault positive sequence current can help the directional relay to take accurate decision during erroneous CCVT secondary response. The available CCVT model in PSCAD is not able to generate significant subsidence transient in the secondary side. So, a new CCVT model is developed in EMTDC/PSCAD domain for transient response analysis and to check the relay operation. Next, the performance of different voltage and current information based directional relaying techniques have been analyzed and compared with the proposed method. The results are evaluated for different system and fault conditions. Results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – It is {{well known}} that typical voltage {{transducers}} utilized on E. H. V. power transmission lines have a limited bandwidth and that the frequency of traveling wave components of the fault induced transients is inversely proportional to fault distance along the lines. Frequencies to be expected can range from hundreds of Hz to infinite (for close in faults). It is shown that Coupling <b>Capacitor</b> <b>Voltage</b> <b>Transformer</b> (CCVT) secondary voltages, normally applied to conventional protection schemes, do not comprise the appropriate information for a scheme that operates on the high frequency fault generated transients. Regarding its secondary voltages, the CCVT acts as a low-pass filter, which rejects higher frequencies. Conversely, it is shown {{that it is possible to}} capture the appropriate traveling wave information (contained in the fault induced transients) using a high frequency tap from a CCVT. This tap acts as a high-pass filter, which rejects lower frequencies. This paper presents a number of ATP fault simulations studies on a typical 500 kV system...|$|E
40|$|The {{evidence}} is growing world wide that EHV level transients caused by fast switching devices are breaking down insulations in power circuit breakers and transformers. The normal substation {{devices such as}} <b>capacitor</b> coupled <b>voltage</b> <b>transformers,</b> potential transformers, and equipment bushings {{do a good job}} at power frequency, but all have significant limitations (resonant frequencies in the ratio versus frequency) for measuring transients with higher frequency content [5]. A measurement technique is under development at the Southern Company (SoCo) to determine the magnitude and characteristic shape of high voltage transients on the 230 kV and 500 kV bus in Georgia Power’s O’Hara Substation. This is in conjunction with the continuing on-line FRA (frequency response analysis) project on the 500 / 230 kV auto-transformer at the O’Hara Substation [1, 2, 3]. The same bushing tap source for the on-line FRA is used to calculate the magnitude and wave shape of the transients at the 230 and 500 kV transformer bushing inputs. A laboratory grade wide bandwidth voltage divider is erected in close proximity to the phase one 230 kV transformer bushing to validate the transient calculations from the FRA software. The de-convolution software is not yet complete to produce corrected time domain transient data from the bushing tap information, but comparisons can be made from the raw time domain data. This paper shows a comparison of transients from the bushing taps and the wideband voltage divider. The paper also shows that transients of a relatively high frequency content are available on an EHV bus and these same transients travel through the windings to allow the on-line computation of a frequency response analysis (FRA) for the perspective winding. The transients generated from de-energizing 950 ft. of 500 kV bus and from low level lightning outside the substation are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Detta examensarbete har genomförts på ABB Power Products/Instrument Transformers i Ludvika. Syftet med arbetet har varit att undersöka temperaturexpansionen för en isolerande olja som använd i produkten <b>Capacitor</b> <b>Voltage</b> <b>Transformer</b> (CVT). Oljans egen temperatur­expansionskoefficient                          var redan känd, men arbetets syfte var att bestämma en Brutto­temperaturexpansionskoefficient, med andra ord undersöka hur mycket de ingående komponenterna i en CVT påverkar den totala volymexpansionen inuti enheten. För att bestämma bruttotemperaturexpansionskoefficienten har ett prov i klimatkammare utförts. Provet bestod av två aluminiumkärl vardera med ett monterat mätrör. Det ena kärlet fylldes med olja och det andra kärlet med olja och kondensatorinnehåll motsvarande inne­hållet i en CVT. Provobjekten utsattes sedan för en bestämd tid i temperaturer från - 60 °C till 65 °C med intervall om 10 °C. Under denna tid utfördes ett antal mätningar av oljevolymen i de båda provobjekten. Dessa mätningar användes sedan tillsammans med ett några korrektions­faktorer för att beräkna temperaturexpansionskoefficienten för både oljan (enbart för kontroll­erande syfte) och kondensatorinnehållet. Tillsammans ger dessa bruttotemperaturexpansions­koefficienten för alla möjliga volymkombinationer. Resultatet från provet har sedan analyserats och visualiserats i form av tabeller och diagram. Efter det beräknades temperaturexpansionskoefficient för oljan samt  för kondensator­innehållet vid olika temperaturer. Utifrån dessa värden beräknades de genomsnittliga temperatur­­expansionskoefficienterna för temperaturintervallet och slutligen angavs en formel för att bestämma bruttotemperaturexpansionskoefficienten för olika procentuella fördelningar mellan olja och kondensatorinnehåll. Till sist drogs slutsatser utifrånfrån resultatet. This {{bachelor}} thesis {{was carried}} out at ABB Power Products/Instrument Transformers in Ludvika. The purpose of the work has been to examine the thermal expansion for an isolating oil that {{is used in the}} product <b>Capacitor</b> <b>Voltage</b> <b>Transformer</b> (CVT). The oil’s own expansion coefficient                          was already known, but the purpose of the work was to determine a gross thermal expansion coefficient, with other words to examine the amount of influense the other componets had on the volume expansion inside the unit. To decide the gross thermal expansion coefficient a test has been carried out in a climat chamer. To performe the test two aluminum tanks, each with a measurement tube mounted on the top were used. One of the tanks was filled with oil and the other one was filled with oil and capacitor contents corresponding tio the contents in a CVT. The two test objects were then exposed to temperatures reaching from - 60 °C to 65 °C in steps of 10 °C. During this time a number of volume measurements were performed on the two test objects. These measure­ments together with a few correction parameters were used to decide the thermal expansion coefficient for both the oil (only for control purpose) and the capacitor contents. Together these two gives the gross thermal expansion coefficient for all posible volume combinations. The results from the tests has been analised and visualised in the form of tables an diagrams. After that the thermal expansion coefficient for the oil and the capacitorcontents, for different temperatures was calculated. Bult on those calculations the avarege thermal expansion coeff­icient for the temperatureintervals was calculated, and finaly an modle for calculating the gross thermal expansion coefficient was created. At the end conclusions were drawn from the results. ...|$|E
