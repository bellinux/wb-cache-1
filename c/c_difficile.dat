25|$|Clostridium difficile is {{the most}} common cause of Antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and the {{resulting}} <b>C.</b> <b>difficile</b> mediated infection (CDI) is potentially deadly. <b>C.</b> <b>difficile</b> associated diarrhea (CDAD) is manifested by severe inflammation and colitis, mostly due to the release of two exotoxins by <b>C.</b> <b>difficile</b> that cause destruction of epithelial cells in the intestine. The study “Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B-30892 can inhibit cytotoxic effects and adhesion of pathogenic Clostridium difficile to Caco-2 cells“ demonstrates that L. bulgaricus can reduce the colonization of <b>C.</b> <b>difficile</b> cells in colorectal cells, and thus prevent Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea.|$|E

Here, by using Clostridium <b>difficile</b> (<b>C.</b> diff) toxin A as a model antigen, we demonstrated that DNA immunization was effective in producing a panel of mAb that are protective against toxin A challenge and can also be used as sensitive reagents to detect toxin A from various testing samples.

Further studies should be conducted to fully establish DNA immunization as a unique platform to produce mAb in various hosts...|$|R
5000|$|The hospital, like others, has had {{problems}} with hospital acquired infections such as MRSA and Clostridium <b>difficile</b> (<b>C.</b> diff).

Performance figures released by the trust in September 2007 showed that hospital acquired infection rates had fallen further with just one case of MRSA in August and 18 of C.Diff, compared with more than 30 just a few months previous.

40|$|Background Recurrent <b>C</b> lostridium <b>difficile</b> {{infection}} (CDI) {{represents a}} significant {{burden on the}} healthcare system and is associated with poor outcomes in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients. Data are limited evaluating recurrence rates and risk factors for recurrence in HSCT patients. Methods HSCT patients who developed CDI between January 2010 and December 2012 were divided into 2 groups: non‐recurrent CDI (nr CDI) and recurrent CDI (rCDI). Risk factors for rCDI were compared between groups. Rate of recurrence in HSCT patients was compared to that in other hospitalized patients. Results CDI was diagnosed in 95 of 711 HSCT patients (22 rCDI and 73 nr CDI). Recurrence rates were similar in HSCT patients compared with other hospitalized patients (23. 2 % vs. 22. 9 %, P  >  0. 99). Patients in the rCDI group developed the index case of CDI significantly earlier than the nr CDI group (3. 5  days vs. 7. 0  days after transplant, P  =  0. 05). On univariate analysis, patients with rCDI {{were more likely to}} have prior history of CDI and neutropenia at the time of the index CDI case. Neutropenia at the time of the index CDI case was the only independent predictor of rCDI (78. 8 vs. 34. 8 %, P  =  0. 006) on multivariate analysis. Conclusions The rate of rCDI was similar between HSCT and other hospitalized patients, and the majority of patients developed the index case of CDI within a week of transplantation. Neutropenia at the index CDI case may be associated with increased rates of rCDI...|$|R
40|$|Clostridium <b>difficile</b> (<b>C.</b> diff) {{is a major}} {{nosocomial}} problem. Epidemiological {{surveillance of}} the disease {{can be accomplished by}} microbiological or administrative data. Microbiological tracking is problematic since it does not always translate into clinical disease, and it is not always available. Tracking by administrative data is attractive, but ICD- 9 code accuracy for C. diff is unknown. By using a large administrative database of hospitalized patients with C. diff (by ICD- 9 code or cytotoxic assay), this study found that the sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of ICD- 9 coding were 71 %, 99 %, 87 %, and 96 % respectively (using micro data as the gold standard). When only using symptomatic patients the sensitivity increased to 82 % and when only using symptomatic patients whose test results were available at discharge, the sensitivity increased to 88 %. C. diff ICD- 9 codes closely approximate true C. diff infection, especially in symptomatic patients whose test results are available at the time of discharge, and can therefore be used as a reasonable alternative to microbiological data for tracking purposes...|$|R
40|$|ArticleLactobacillus equigenerosi strain Le 1, {{a natural}} {{inhabitant}} of the equine gastrointestinal tract, survived pH 3. 0 and incubation {{in the presence}} of 1. 5 % (wt/vol) bile salts for at least 2 h. Strain Le 1 showed 8 % cell surface hydrophobicity, 60 % auto-aggregation, and 47 % coaggregation with Clostridium <b>difficile</b> <b>C</b> 6. Only 1 % of the cells adhered to viable buccal epithelial cells and invaded the cells within 20 min after contact. Preincubation of strain Le 1 in a buffer containing pronase prevented adhesion to viable epithelial cells. Preincubation in a pepsin buffer delayed invasion from 20 min to 1 h. Strain Le 1 did not adhere to nonviable epithelial cells. Administration of L. equigenerosi Le 1 (1 x 10 9 CFU per 50 kg body weight) to healthy horses did not increase white blood cell numbers. Differential white blood cell counts and aspartate aminotransferase levels remained constant.

25|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{efficacy of}} various copper alloys against Clostridium difficile was recently evaluated. The viability of <b>C.</b> <b>difficile</b> spores and vegetative cells were studied on copper alloys C11000 (99.9% copper), C51000 (95% copper), C70600 (90% copper), C26000 (70% copper), and C75200 (65% copper). Stainless steel (S30400) {{was used as}} the experimental control. The copper alloys significantly reduced the viability of both <b>C.</b> <b>difficile</b> spores and vegetative cells. On C75200, near total kill was observed after one hour (however, at 6 hours total <b>C.</b> <b>difficile</b> increased, and decreased slower afterwards). On C11000 and C51000, near total kill was observed after 3 hours, then total kill in 24 hours on C11000 and 48 hours on C51000. On C70600, near total kill was observed after 5 hours. On C26000, near total kill was achieved after 48 hours. On stainless steel, no reductions in viable organisms were observed after 72 hours (3 days) of exposure and no significant reduction was observed within 168 hours (1 week).|$|E

40|$|The {{action of}} toxins A, B, and <b>C</b> from Clostridium <b>difficile</b> was {{studied in the}} small {{intestine}} and colon of rats. All three caused fluid accumulation in the small intestine, maximal secretion being induced by 1 micrograms of toxin A, 20 micrograms of B, and 15 micrograms of C. Both toxins A and C caused shedding of epithelial cells from the villi without visible damage to crypt cells; toxin A caused further extensive necrosis and bleeding. Toxin B caused secretion without visible damage to the epithelial cells, though this activity was unstable and decreased significantly after one week of storage. In the colon, toxin A caused secretion and shedding of surface epithelial cells without damage to crypt cells, toxin C caused only a weak secretion, and toxin B had no effect at all. In terms of immunohistochemistry, {{it was found that}} toxin A bound to the enterocytes at the tips of the villi but not to goblet and crypt cells.

40|$|AbstractClostridium <b>difficile</b> (<b>C.</b> diff) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and most severe hospital-acquired infections; its {{consequences}} range from lengthened hospital stay to outright lethality. C.  diff causes cellular damage through the action of two large toxins TcdA and TcdB. Recently, there has been increased effort toward developing antitoxin therapies, rather than antibacterial treatments, in hopes of mitigating the acquisition of drug resistance. To date, no analysis of the recognition mechanism of TcdA or TcdB has been attempted. Here, we use small molecule flexible docking followed by unbiased molecular dynamics to obtain a more detailed perspective on how inhibitory peptides, exemplified by two species HQSPWHH and EGWHAHT function. Using principal component analysis and generalized masked Delaunay analysis, an examination of the conformational space of TcdB in its apo form as well as forms bound to the peptides and UDP-Glucose was performed. Although both species inhibit by binding in the active site, they do so in two very different ways. The simulations show that the conformational space occupied by TcdB bound to the two peptides are quite different and provide valuable insight for the future design of toxin inhibitors and other enzymes that interact with their substrates through conformational capture mechanisms and thus work by the disruption of the protein’s intrinsic motions...|$|R
