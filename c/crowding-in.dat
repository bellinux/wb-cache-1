5000|$|Economist Laura D'Andrea Tyson {{wrote in}} June 2012: [...] "By itself an {{increase}} in the deficit, either in the form of {{an increase in}} government spending or a reduction in taxes, causes an increase in demand. But how this affects output, employment and growth depends on what happens to interest rates. When the economy is operating near capacity, government borrowing to finance {{an increase in the}} deficit causes interest rates to rise. Higher interest rates reduce or “crowd out” private investment, and this reduces growth. The “crowding out” argument explains why large and sustained government deficits take a toll on growth; they reduce capital formation. But this argument rests on how government deficits affect interest rates, and the relationship between government deficits and interest rates varies. When there is considerable excess capacity, an increase in government borrowing to finance an increase in the deficit does not lead to higher interest rates and does not crowd out private investment. Instead, the higher demand resulting from the increase in the deficit bolsters employment and output directly, and the resulting increase in income and economic activity in turn encourages or 'crowds in' additional private spending. The <b>crowding-in</b> argument is the right one for current economic conditions." ...|$|E

The results for the short-run suggest that output growth and public investment were the dominant determinants of private investment, while those for the long-run suggest FDI as an additional dominant determinant. The monetary policy variables were on the other hand less effective determinants. Furthermore, whereas output growth and FDI were implicit <b>crowding-in</b> factors, public investment was an effective crowding-out factor. The other determinants imparted both <b>crowding-in</b> and crowding-out effects.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the short run and long run effects of fiscal policy. The classical-Harrodian model {{developed}} in Moudud (2000, 1999), which is an extension of Shaikh (1995, 1992, 1991), provides a demonstration of dynamic fiscal policy context. It asserts that the there is a crowding in of output growth in the short run. In the long run, however, the impact of government spending is subject to change under some circumstances of capital utilization, normal profit rate and social savings rate. Blinder and Solow (1973), using IS-LM model, reveal that bond-financed fiscal expansion does not engender a complete crowding out. Friedman (1978, 1985) notices the possibility of <b>crowding-in.</b> Crowding-out or <b>crowding-in</b> debate can be extended to other economists. Blanchard and Perotti (1999) and Easterly and Rebelo (1993) reach <b>crowding-in</b> results. Bairam and Ward (1993) find crowding-out of private investment. Barro (1989, 1999) and Kormendi and Meguire (1985) obtain either a negative or no effect of government spending on the growth, whereas the works of Argimon et al. (1997), Devarajan et al. (1996) and Ahmed and Miller (2000) have mixed results. This study runs VECM models and impulse response analysis to juxtapose the crowding in/out effects of fiscal policy. Investigating the short run and long-run implications of fiscal policy for the Turkish economy, this paper concludes that government investments crowd out, whereas its current expenditures crowd in the private investment. ...|$|E
30|$|This finding {{suggests}} that during a consolidation episode, employment {{tends to be more}} reactive to output than in normal times. If output is expanding then employment would expand more than in normal times, while if output is contracting, employment would contract more than in normal times. Hence, consolidating in good times (during output expansion) is here found to positively affect employment. The result is robust under a specification which includes the duration of the consolidation episode, expressed in number of years. Further, distinguishing between expenditure-driven and revenue-driven consolidation episodes, we find that the Okun’s coefficient is sensitive only to expenditure reduction and not increases in revenue. This is an interesting result which may highlight the presence of a <b>crowding-in</b> effect for the private sector when the government size in the economy shrinks. Yet an analysis of the change in the composition of spending during consolidation is necessary to accurately interpret the finding in light of a <b>crowding-in</b> effect for the private sector.|$|E

We investigate whether increased efforts in SSA to attract more FDI have resulted in positive implications of FDI on domestic investment over the years. Our results from the System Generalized Method of Moments (SYS-GMM) estimations suggest that FDI inflows have led to <b>crowding-in</b> of domestic investment for the total time period, {{and particularly in the}} second time sub-period. Next, we examine whether the positive effect of FDI on domestic investment occurs in the case of smaller regional groups in SSA. Therefore, we implement the empirical analysis for five selected Regional Economic Communities (RECs) in SSA, covering: Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), East African Community (EAC), Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and Southern African Development Community (SADC). The results generally show positive impacts of FDI on domestic investment across these RECs, which are consistent with the results obtained for the full sample. We find significant positive effects for COMESA in the first time period, and for ECCAS, ECOWAS, and SADC in the second time period. We extend the empirical analysis by investigating the role played by three development variables (financial development, human capital, and export sector development) in the effect of FDI on domestic investment in SSA. The results show that financial development and human capital tend to lessen the <b>crowding-in</b> effect of FDI on domestic investment in SSA, and could eventually lead to a crowding-out of domestic investment after a certain threshold. In contrast, the results indicate that export sector development tend to augment the <b>crowding-in</b> effect of FDI on domestic investment in SSA. ...|$|E

40|$|While {{the debate}} on the crowding-in-out effects of public {{investment}} on private investment largely seems to point towards a <b>crowding-in</b> effect in developing economies and the opposite in advanced economies, considerable evidence exists on inconclusiveness of such findings across country and regions. This research study aimed at investigating the possible <b>crowding-in</b> effects of disaggregated public investment, human capital, and corporate governance on private investment on 10 developing economies of one of the world's most underdeveloped regions, Southern Africa. Two investment models of neoclassical and flexible accelerator were modified to empirically capture the structural and institutional characteristics of the region. Further, against the background of capital availability as a binding constraint in developing economies, a survey was conducted on one of the countries in the panel for an in-depth analysis of corporate governance's link to fixed private investment in these least developed economies. The study rejects the hypothesis of 'the lesser developed economy, the higher the <b>crowding-in</b> effect' but instead points to a strong contemporaneous crowding-out effect of public investment in this least developed region. However, the models find that financial and external factors relating to macroeconomic uncertainties are important over institutional factors in conditioning private investment levels in the region. On the other hand, while the results on the components of FDI and domestic private investment are largely similar, it is macroeconomic volatility, particularly that of exchange rates and the size of government, that have the most impact on FDI both in the short and long-term. Human capital as measured by literacy rates is found to have no contemporaneous or long-term effects on all private investment components but education expenditure does except on FDI.

The support for the significant <b>crowding-in</b> effects of public capital has important implications for the formulation of long-term growth and development strategies.
