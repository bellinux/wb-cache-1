40|$|The kinetical {{characteristics}} of ATP hydrolysis by mitochondrial Fi-ATPase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) {{have been studied}} under conditions where only a single catalytic site per enzyme molecule bound ATP. Four major features were observed, that is, fast ATP binding to the enzyme, slow product release from the enzyme, an equilibrium close to unity between ATP and products on the enzyme, and promotion of ATP hydrolysis on the second addition of a large excess of ATP (<b>cold</b> <b>chase).</b> These are {{essentially the same as}} the kinetical characteristics observed for beef heart mitochondrial Fi-ATPase, which were called as unisite catalysis by Grubmeyer et al. (Grubmeyer, C. et al. (1982) /. Biol. Chem. 257, 12092 - 12100), although the release of a hydrolysis product, Pi, from the yeast enzyme appeared to occur significantly faster than that from the beef enzyme, which resulted in a de-creased extent of <b>cold</b> <b>chase</b> promotion of ATP hydrolysis of the yeast enzyme. The yeast Fi-ATPase showed unisite catalysis {{even in the absence of}} Pi in the reac-tion mixtures, while it was reported for the beef FrATPase that the presence of Pi in the reaction mixture was essential for unisite catalysis (Penefsky, H.

40|$|Autoantibodies to RNA polymerases (RNAP) I, II, and III are {{reported}} to be highly specific for the diagnosis of scleroderma (systemic sclerosis, SSc). In the present study, the specificity of autoantibodies to RNAP I and III for SSc was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of 35 S-labeled proteins. However, we report here the previously unrecognized production of anti-RNAP II autoantibodies by 9 - 14 % of patients with SLE and mixed connective tissue disease/overlap syndrome. 12 out of 32 anti-RNAP II positive sera (group 1) immunoprecipitated a diffuse 220 - 240 -kD band identified as the largest subunit of RNAP II whereas the remaining 20 (group 2) immunoprecipitated preferentially the 240 -kD phosphorylated (IIo) form of the large subunit. After pulse labeling, group 1 sera immunoprecipitated only the 220 -kD (IIa) RNAP II subunit, whereas the diffuse IIa/IIo band plus the 145 -kD second largest RNAP II subunit (IIc) were immunoprecipitated after several hours of <b>cold</b> <b>chase,</b> suggesting that these sera recognized primarily the largest subunit of RNAP II. Group 2 sera recognized the IIc subunit after pulse labeling, and immunoprecipitated the IIc and IIo, but not the IIa, subunits after <b>cold</b> <b>chase.</b> Although {{it has been suggested}} that autoantibodies to RNAP II are usually accompanied by anti-RNAP I/III in SSc, all but one of the anti-RNAP II positive sera from SLE or mixed connective tissue disease/overlap syndrome patients, as well as most of the SSc sera, were negative for anti-RNAP I/III. Moreover, in contrast to previous reports suggesting that anti-RNAP antibodies rarely coexist with other SSc subset marker antibodies, anti-RNAP II antibodies were often accompanied by anti-Ku, anti-nRNP, or anti-topoisomerase I autoantibodies in the present study. We conclude that autoantibodies to RNAP II are not a specific marker for SSc, whereas autoantibodies to RNAP I/III are associated primarily with SSc. In addition, we have identified two distinctive patterns of RNAP II antigen recognition by autoantibodies, one of them characterized by specific recognition of the transcriptionally active (phosphorylated) form of RNAP II. The clinical significance of these different patterns remains to be determined...|$|E

40|$|Antibodies {{directed}} against {{small nuclear ribonucleoprotein}} (snRNP) particles {{are found in the}} Sm and RNP autoimmune sera from numerous patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). These two reactivities differ in disease distribution as well as antigen specificity. Although sera from both of these autoimmune syndromes contain snRNP reactive antibodies, distinction in antigen binding specificity have been difficult to define because of the particulate nature of the snRNP antigen. To overcome this problem, while retaining the antigen in a native state, cells were pulse-labeled with [35 S]methionine for 8 min to generate radioactive snRNP proteins in forms reflecting incomplete de novo particle assembly. Immunoprecipitation of snRNP antigen prepared in this manner revealed clearly distinct patterns of Sm and RNP immunorecognition. While Sm sera precipitated all eight labeled snRNP proteins, RNP antibodies precipitated only two of the eight. However, a brief pulse followed by periods of <b>cold</b> <b>chase</b> demonstrated that RNP sera can eventually coprecipitate all components of the complete particle. In addition to antibodies to the other six snRNP peptides, all Sm sera tested have been found to contain the RNP-like reactivity with snRNP proteins A and C. RNP reactivity with these two components is of particular interest because these proteins are unique in the metabolism of snRNPs. Defining and distinguishing the precise peptides recognized by Sm and RNP antibodies has helped to clarify the biochemical basis of the standard laboratory tests for these antigen reactivities...|$|E
40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} {{functions in}} dissipating forces applied across joints. It comprises an extracellular matrix containing primarily collagens, proteoglycans {{and water to}} maintain its functional properties, and is interspersed with chondrocytes. The chondrocyte cytoskeleton comprises actin microfilaments, tubulin microtubules and vimentin intermediate filaments. Previous studies have determined the contribution of actin and tubulin in regulating the synthesis of the extracellular matrix components aggrecan and type II collagen. The contribution of vimentin to extracellular matrix biosynthesis in any cell type has not previously been addressed. Therefore {{the aim of this}} study was to assess the role of vimentin in cartilage chondrocyte metabolism. Vimentin intermediate filaments were disrupted in high-density monolayer articular chondrocyte cultures using acrylamide for 7 days. De novo protein and collagen synthesis were measured by adding [3 H]-proline, and sulphated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) synthesis measured by adding [35 S]-sulphate to cultures. Vimentin disruption resulted in decreased collagen synthesis, whilst sGAG synthesis was unaffected. In addition, there was a significant reduction in type II collagen and aggrecan gene transcription suggesting that the effects observed occur at both the transcriptional and translational levels. A 3 -day <b>cold</b> <b>chase</b> demonstrated a significant inhibition of collagen and sGAG degradation; the reduction in collagen degradation was corroborated by the observed reduction in both pro-MMP 2 expression and activation. We have demonstrated that an intact vimentin intermediate filament network contributes to the maintenance of the chondrocyte phenotype and thus an imbalance favouring filament disassembly can disturb the integrity of the articular cartilage, and may ultimately lead to the development of pathologies such as osteoarthritis...|$|E

40|$|Axenic trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica showed {{increased}} logarithmic growth but {{absence of}} "chromatoid" material (stacked helical arrays of ribonucleoprotein [RNP]) when grown in an all-liquid monophasic culture. Organisms grown in a liquid overlay on a semisolid slant (biphasic medium) showed slow logarithmic {{growth and the}} presence of chromatoid material. Chromatoid material accumulated in the rapidly growing trophozoites from monophasic culture during treatment with the Vinca alkaloid, vinblastine. Many of the glycogen-free regions of vinblastine-treated trophozoites as well as, to a lesser degree, of normal cells grown in monophasic and biphasic cultures, contained free ribosomes and randomly oriented 60 A filaments. As ribonucleoprotein assumed the packed helical configuration, areas consisting of parallel, packed filaments could be detected adjacent to and continuous with the ordered RNP arrays. This arrangement could be visualized most frequently in vinblastine-treated trophozoites grown in monophasic cultures. Depending on the tilt of the section with respect to the longitudinal axis of individual helices, 60 A filamentous material could be demonstrated associated with the RNP helices. Localization of ribonucleoprotein precursors was followed by means of high resolution radioautography with uridine- 3 H and cytidine- 3 H. With a short (30 -min) pulse, label could be visualized only over the glycogen-free areas containing free ribosomes and filaments. With 60 -min pulses, label could also be seen over the packed helical arrays. With 30 -min pulses followed by a 60 -min <b>cold</b> <b>chase,</b> label was seen chiefly over RNP helices. It is postulated that the areas containing ribosomes and filaments represent sites of assembly of the RNP helices possibly on a filament protein column.

40|$|Microbial phosphorus-cycling, with {{particular}} emphasis on algal/bacterial competition, was studied in depth profiles through the halocline separating a brackish top layer, rich in nitrate and poor in phosphate, from the underlying coastal water, poor in both nitrate and phosphate, in the Sandsfjord area, western Norway. At 2 stations along the axis of natural freshwater outflow, physiological P-deficiency of algae and bacteria in the brackish layer was inferred from rapid luxury consumption of added PO 43 - by organisms in size fractions > 1 mum and 1 - 0. 2 mum, respectively. In {{a branch of the}} fjord without natural freshwater outlets, luxury consumption in the brackish layer was less, and without a clear difference between the 2 water layers. High luxury consumption coincided with short (1 mum and 1 - 0. 2 mum was found to depend on whether label was added as (gamma-AVP) -P- 32 or as (PO 43 -) -P- 32, indicating that coupling of uptake to hydrolysis by cell-bound enzymes could modify the outcome of algal-bacterial phosphorus competition. Disappearance rate of P- 32 from the 1 - 0. 2 mum size fraction following initial labeling and a subsequent <b>cold</b> <b>chase</b> with PO 43 - was used to estimate the flow-rate of phosphorus through the microbial food web. Combined with measured kinetic constants for PO 43 - uptake, alkaline phosphatases and 5 'nucleotidases, a coherent flow-scheme could only be obtained assuming very low (< 1 nmol l- 1) concentrations of PO 43 - and nucleotides. Chemically measured concentrations of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) more than 2 orders of magnitude above the estimated nucleotide level and with an estimated turnover time of ca 500 h, are consistent with the view that this large P-reservoir consists mainly of slowly hydrolyzable polymers...|$|E

40|$|We {{have sought}} to {{understand}} {{the role of the}} electrophoretically invariant chain (Ii) in class II antigen functions, particularly in certain transformed cells in which we have previously demonstrated hyperexpression of Ii. Molecular structures and relative kinetics of Ii synthesis, processing and turnover were compared in paired, Ia+ and Ia- Burkitt 2 ̆ 7 s lymphoma (BL) cell lines and in hairy cell leukemia (HCL) cells. Cells were metabolically labeled with [35 S] methionine for 15 min (with or without a <b>cold</b> methionine <b>chase</b> to 3 hr) or were continuously labeled for 3 hr. One- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis resolved immunoprecipitates formed with a) a heteroantiserum to purified class II antigen (demonstrating alpha and beta chains and Ii associated with that complex), b) a heteroantiserum to hairy cell leukemia (HCL) membranes (demonstrating principally the dominant, basic form of Ii molecules, class I antigens, and some additional proteins), and c) a monoclonal antibody to human Ii. Treatment of Ia+ Jijoye and its daughter, Ia- P 3 HR- 1, BL cells with 4 mM butyrate for 48 hr enhanced the synthesis of the dominant, basic form of Ii but did not affect apparent turnover rates of that pool of Ii chains in either cell line. In Ia+ Jijoye cells but not in Ia- P 3 HR- 1 cells Ii was terminally processed to more acidic, sialic acid-derivatized forms. Butyrate treatment did not alter the relative turnover rate of terminally processed Ii in Jijoye cells. The level of the dominant, basic form of Ii in HCL cells equaled that in butyrate-treated Jijoye cells, and relative turnover rates of this terminally unprocessed Ii pool were similar in HCL and Jijoye cells. However, HCL Ia-associated Ii was not terminally processed, as was Ia-associated Ii in Jijoye cells. The expression of Ia auxiliary proteins, p 41 and p 25, was also enhanced in Jijoye cells by butyrate treatment and was prominent in HCL cells. From these experiments, we may hypothesize the following. In lymphoblastoid cells, two pathways for Ii turnover could exist. One is through association with Ia complexes and progressive terminal processing of carbohydrate side chains and a second is not associated with Ia or, apparently, with such processing. Because Ii is not found to be terminally processed in the absence of class II antigen, Ia might be considered to direct the processing of a subset of Ii towards some function (rather than vice versa).
