There are no <b>commissary</b> or exchange <b>privileges.</b> Housing is often substandard, and military appropriations for facilities maintenance often focus on appeasing civilian communities near bases rather than on improving on-base facilities.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThere is a continuous effort by civilian lobbyists to induce Congressional legislation {{that will require}} commissaries to contract their management with private firms or either prohibit military retirees from using the commissary or eliminate all commissaries within the Continental United States (CONUS). This thesis {{is concerned with the}} <b>commissary</b> as a <b>privilege.</b> It highlights the tangible value currently available to the service family in the Monterey, California area. The data analyzed in this thesis is the result of an extensive empirical study of shelf prices gathered from the Fort Ord Commissary, California, and is compared to the shelf prices of three commercial "chain" supermarkets in close proximity to Fort Ord. A questionnaire was distributed to potential patrons of the Fort Ord Commissary to gather information on the perceptions of the commissary as a military benefit. The questionnaire responses and price data were then used to derive theoretical models which encompass the direct and indirect costs of grocery shopping. [URL] United States Marine Corp...|$|R
5000|$|A prison {{commissary}} (commissary being a word {{taken out}} of context in such situations) or canteen is a store within a correctional facility, from which inmates may purchase products such as hygiene items, snacks, writing instruments, etc. Spices, including those packaged with instant ramen noodles, are a popular item due to the often bland nature of prison food. Typically inmates are not allowed to possess cash; instead, they make purchases through an account with funds from money contributed by friends, family members, etc., or earned as wages. Typically, prisons set a maximum limit of funds that can be spent by each inmate on commissary; in the U.S. federal system, it is $290 per month. It is generally prohibited for inmates to trade items purchased on commissary. However, certain items tend to be used as currency. Cigarettes were a classic medium of exchange, but in the wake of prison tobacco bans, postage stamps have become a more common currency item, along with any inexpensive, popular item that has a round number price such as 25 or 50 cents. As prison budgets are cut in the USA, ramen has become a popular commodity to supplement food needs. Mylar foil packets of mackerel fish or [...] "macks" [...] are one such item. In 1930, the U.S. Department of Justice authorized and established a commissary at each federal institution. Some prison commissaries are staffed by government employees and inmates, while others have been completely privatized. Significant price markups are common in prison commissaries, although some prison systems set maximum markups; for instance, the Delaware Department of Correction has a 20% maximum markup. $100 million in purchases were made from Texas' prison system alone in 2009. Prison <b>commissary</b> is a <b>privilege</b> that is often taken away for infractions.|$|R

5000|$|Within {{two weeks}} of the move, on March 29 of that year, prisoners rioted, setting fires inside their housing units. The prisoners were upset over a lack of <b>commissary</b> <b>privileges,</b> and a {{perceived}} low quality of television service, so they obscured a surveillance camera with a blanket and set fire to mattresses. The fire inflicted $500,000 worth of property damage. Of 174 prisoners involved, 12 were hospitalized. $1.5 million was spent to care for the injured prisoners. Ten Mexican citizens and one Costa Rican citizen received charges of damaging federal government property and conspiracy. The civilian prisoners were transferred to civilian facilities. During that year the Secretary of the Navy said that Miramar will never again be used to house illegal immigrants, the civilian population sent to Miramar. Randy [...] "Duke" [...] Cunningham, a member of the United States House of Representatives who had opposed the housing of illegal immigrants in the facility, said that the move was a [...] "victory for San Diegans" [...] because putting illegal immigrants in the brig placed national security in danger. Illegal immigrants who would have been sent to Miramar instead were sent to jails in Imperial County, California, Kern County, California, and Arizona. As a result, the parties that handled the transportation received millions of dollars in transportation costs.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedDue to a shifting national focus {{aimed at reducing}} Department of Defense force levels and weapons procurement, no program is safe from budget cutting scrutiny. The reduction has affected all areas of Defense and {{has become known as}} downsizing.

40|$|Excerpt] The {{military}} {{retirement system}} is a government-funded noncontributory, defined benefit system that has historically been viewed as a significant incentive in retaining a career military force. The system currently includes monthly compensation for qualified active and reserve retirees, disability benefits for those deemed medically unfit to serve, and a survivor annuity program for the eligible survivors of deceased retirees. The amount of compensation is dependent on time served, basic pay at retirement, and is adjusted annually through a Cost-of-Living-Adjustment (COLA). Military retirees are also entitled to nonmonetary benefits including exchange and <b>commissary</b> <b>privileges,</b> medical care through TRICARE, and access to Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) facilities and programs. Currently, active component personnel are eligible for retirement or “vested” after completing 20 years of service (YOS) and have a choice between two options (High-Three or Career Status Bonus/Redux) based on career expectations and the individual’s financial situation. Reserve personnel are eligible for retirement after 20 years of creditable service based on a points system, but do not typically begin to draw retirement pay until age 60. A third category of retirement is disability retirement. In FY 2013, $ 54 billion was paid to approximately 2. 2 million military retirees and survivors. Given {{the size of the}} program, some have viewed military retirement as a place where substantial budgetary savings could be made. However, others have argued that past modifications intended to save money have had a deleterious effect on military recruiting and retention. Military retirees, families, and veterans’ service organizations closely monitor potential future changes to the retirement system. When considering alternatives to the current system, Congress will likely consider the balance between budget constraints and the needs and concerns of this constituent group. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2013 established a Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) to provide the President and Congress with specific recommendations to modernize pay and benefits for the armed services. The commission recommended substantial changes to the current retirement system from a purely defined benefit system to a blended system. The new system would allow more servicemembers to develop retirement savings earlier in their careers through contributions into the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) coupled with government matching and early vesting, and would reduce the defined benefit multiplier for calculating the retirement annuity from 2. 5 % to 2. 0 %. The new multiplier would provide Servicemembers retiring at 20 years of service with 40 % of their “pay base” at retirement rather than 50 % under the current system. Under the commission’s proposed changes, existing servicemembers and retirees would be able to remain in the old system or opt into the new system...|$|E

Many of the MCRMC recommendations were adopted by Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2016 (P. L. 114 - 92). The new system under P. L. 114 - 92 will allow more servicemembers to accrue retirement savings earlier in their careers through contributions into the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) coupled with government matching and early vesting.

The new multiplier will provide servicemembers retiring at 20 years of service with 40 % of their base pay at retirement rather than 50 % under the current system. The new changes will go into effect on January 1, 2018. At that time all entering servicemembers will be enrolled in the new system, existing servicemembers and retirees will be able to remain in the old system, and those with less than 12 years of service prior to January 1, 2018, would be able to opt into the new system...|$|E
