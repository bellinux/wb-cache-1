A selenomethionyl derivative of the protein, obtained by Escherichia coli expression and with complete Met→Se-Met substitution confirmed by mass spectrometry, amino-acid analysis and X-ray absorption spectra, was <b>crystallized</b> <b>in</b> the <b>cubic</b> <b>form.</b> A truncated {{variant of the}} protein, lacking ten N-terminal residues, has also been crystallized.

40|$|The author {{discusses}} {{the properties of}} classical Coulombic matter at low temperatures. It has been well {{known for some time}} [1, 2] that infinite Coulombic matter will <b>crystallize</b> <b>in</b> body-centered <b>cubic</b> <b>form</b> when the quantity {Lambda} (the dimensionless ratio of the average two-particle Coulomb energy to the kinetic energy per particle) is larger than {approximately} 175. But the systems of such particles that have been produced in the laboratory in ion traps, or ion beams, are finite with surfaces defined by the boundary conditions that have to be satisfied. This results in ion clouds with sharply defined curved surfaces, and interior structures that show up as a set of concentric layers that are parallel to the outer surface. The ordering {{does not appear to be}} cubic, but the charges on each shell exhibit a ''hexatic'' pattern of equilateral triangles that is the characteristic of liquid crystals. The curvature of the surfaces prevents the structures on successive shells from interlocking in any simple fashion. This class of structures was first found in simulations [3] and later in experiments [4]...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSatellite {{tobacco mosaic}} virus (STMV) can undergo {{at least two}} {{physical}} transitions that significantly alter its mechanical and structural characteristics. At high pH the 17 -nm STMV particles expand radially by about 5 Å to yield particles having diameters of about 18 nm. This pH-induced transition is further promoted by aging of the virions and degradation of the RNA, so that swollen particles ultimately appear even at neutral pH. While the native 17 -nm particles crystallize as orthorhombic or monoclinic crystals which diffract to high resolution (1. 8 Å), the enlarged 18 -nm particles <b>crystallize</b> <b>in</b> a <b>cubic</b> <b>form</b> which diffracts to no better than 5 Å. In the transition, {{not only do the}} capsid protein subunits move radially outward, but the helical RNA segments with which they interact do as well. This is noteworthy because it demonstrates that the RNA and the protein shell are capable of coordinated movement, and that neither structure is rigidly defined or independent of the other. Using atomic force microscopy, it can be shown that STMV particles, upon drying, lose their mechanical rigidity and undergo deformation. Virions initially 17 nm in diameter shrink to more uniform final sizes than do 18 nm, initially swollen particles. This transition appears to be irreversible, as the particles do not reassume their former size nor structural rigidity upon rehydration. Evidence is also presented that preparations of native virus and their crystals are naturally somewhat heterogeneous and contain a variety of particles of anomalous size...|$|R
