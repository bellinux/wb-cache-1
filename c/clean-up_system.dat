40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy‘s National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE NETL) is {{exploring}} affordable technologies and processes to convert domestic coal and biomass resources to high-quality liquid hydrocarbon fuels. This interest is primarily {{motivated by the}} need to increase energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Gasification technologies represent clean, flexible and efficient conversion pathways to utilize coal and biomass resources. Substantial experience and knowledge had been developed worldwide on gasification of either coal or biomass. However, reliable data on effects of blending various biomass fuels with coal during gasification process and resulting syngas composition are lacking. In this project, GE Global Research performed a complete characterization of the gas, liquid and solid products that result from the co-gasification of coal/biomass mixtures. This work was performed using a bench-scale gasifier (BSG) and a pilot-scale entrained flow gasifier (EFG). This project focused on comprehensive characterization of the products from gasifying coal/biomass mixtures in a high-temperature, high-pressure entrained flow gasifier. Results from this project provide guidance on appropriate gas <b>clean-up</b> <b>systems</b> and optimization of operating parameters needed to develop and commercialize gasification technologies. GE‘s bench-scale test facility provided the bulk of high-fidelity quantitative data under temperature, heating rate, and residence time conditions closely matching those of commercial oxygen-blown entrained flow gasifiers. Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) pilot-scale test facility provided focused high temperature and pressure tests at entrained flow gasifier conditions. Accurate matching of syngas time-temperature history during cooling ensured that complex species interactions including homogeneous and heterogeneous processes such as particle nucleation, coagulation, surface condensation, and gas-phase reactions were properly reproduced and lead to representative syngas composition at the syngas cooler outlet. The experimental work leveraged other ongoing GE R&D efforts such as biomass gasification and dry feeding systems projects. Experimental data obtained under this project were used to provide guidance on the appropriate <b>clean-up</b> <b>system(s)</b> and operating parameters to coal and biomass combinations beyond those evaluated under this project...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{recognition}} internationally {{of the need to}} demonstrate comprehensiveness in order to build confidence in performance assessments (PAs) for radioactive waste disposal projects. This has resulted in a number of methodologies being developed to formalize the process of defining and documenting the decision basis that underlies a PA.

40|$|Co-gasification {{of biomass}} and coal in large-scale, Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plants {{increases}} {{the efficiency and}} reduces {{the environmental impact of}} making synthesis gas ("syngas") {{that can be used in}} Coal-Biomass-to-Liquids (CBTL) processes for producing transportation fuels. However, the water-gas shift (WGS) and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) catalysts used in these processes may be poisoned by multiple contaminants found in coal-biomass derived syngas; sulfur species, trace toxic metals, halides, nitrogen species, the vapors of alkali metals and their salts (e. g., KCl and NaCl), ammonia, and phosphorous. Thus, it is essential to develop a fundamental understanding of poisoning/inhibition mechanisms before investing in the development of any costly mitigation technologies. We therefore investigated the impact of potential contaminants (H{sub 2 }S, NH{sub 3 }, HCN, AsH{sub 3 }, PH{sub 3 }, HCl, NaCl, KCl, AS{sub 3 }, NH{sub 4 }NO{sub 3 }, NH{sub 4 }OH, KNO{sub 3 }, HBr, HF, and HNO{sub 3 }) on the performance and lifetime of commercially available and generic (prepared in-house) WGS and FT catalysts; ferrochrome-based high-temperature WGS catalyst (HT-WGS, Shiftmax 120 â¢, SÃ¼d-Chemie), low-temperature Cu/ZnO-based WGS catalyst (LT-WGS, Shiftmax 230 â¢, SÃ¼d-Chemie), and iron- and cobalt-based Fischer-Trospch synthesis catalysts (Fe-FT & Co-FT, UK-CAER). In this project, TDA Research, Inc. collaborated with a team at the University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research (UK-CAER) led by Dr. Burt Davis. We first conducted a detailed thermodynamic analysis. The three primary mechanisms whereby the contaminants may deactivate the catalyst are condensation, deposition, and reaction. AsH{sub 3 }, PH{sub 3 }, H{sub 2 }S, HCl, NH{sub 3 } and HCN were found to have a major impact on the Fe-FT catalyst by producing reaction products, while NaCl, KCl and PH{sub 3 } produce trace amounts of deposition products. The impact of the contaminants on the activity, selectivity, and deactivation rates (lifetime) of the catalysts was determined in bench-scale tests. Most of the contaminants appeared to adsorb onto (or react with) the HT- and LT-WGS catalysts were they were co-fed with the syngas: ï· 4. 5 ppmv AsH{sub 3 } or 1 ppmv PH{sub 3 } in the syngas impacted the selectivity and CO conversion of both catalysts; ï· H{sub 2 }S slowly degraded both WGS catalysts; - A binary mixture of H{sub 2 }S (60 ppmv) and NH{sub 3 } (38 ppmv) impacted the activity of the LT-WGS catalyst, but not the HT-WGS catalyst ï· Moderate levels of NH{sub 3 } (100 ppmv) or HCN (10 ppmv) had no impact ï· NaCl or KCl had essentially no effect on the HT-WGS catalyst, but the activity of the LT-WGS catalyst decreased very slowly Long-term experiments on the Co-FT catalyst at 260 and 270 Â°C showed that all of the contaminants impacted it to some extent with the exception of NaCl and HF. Irrespective of its source (e. g., NH{sub 3 }, KNO{sub 3 }, or HNO{sub 3 }), ammonia suppressed the activity of the Co-FT catalyst to a moderate degree. There was essentially no impact the Fe-FT catalyst when up to 100 ppmw halide compounds (NaCl and KCl), or up to 40 ppmw alkali bicarbonates (NaHCO{sub 3 } and KHCO{sub 3 }). After testing, BET analysis showed that the surface areas, and pore volumes and diameters of both WGS catalysts decreased during both single and binary H 2 S and NH 3 tests, which was attributed to sintering and pore filling by the impurities. The HT-WGS catalyst was evaluated with XRD after testing in syngas that contained 1 ppmv PH{sub 3 }, or 2 ppmv H{sub 2 }S, or both H{sub 2 }S (60 ppmv) and NH{sub 3 } (38 ppmv). The peaks became sharper during testing, which was indicative of crystal growth and sintering, but no new phases were detected. After LT-WGS tests (3 - 33 ppmv NH{sub 3 } and/or 0 - 88 ppmv H{sub 2 }S) there were a few new phases that appeared, including sulfides. The fresh Fe-FT catalyst was nanocrystalline and amorphous. ICP-AA spectroscopy and other methods (e. g., chromatography) were used to analyze for Fe, Cu, S, K, Na, P, As, Cl, C, H, and N on both the fresh and tested catalysts. The HT-WGS catalyst displayed higher concentrations of impurities from H{sub 2 }S, NaCl, PH{sub 3 }, KCl, and AsH{sub 3 } on its surface, but no measurable increases in the concentrations of N, H, and C. The LT-WGS catalyst also contained higher concentrations of impurities from H{sub 2 }S, NaCl, NH{sub 3 }+H{sub 2 }S, and AsH{sub 3 }, but no measurable increase in N, H, P, and C. The WGS catalysts exposed to the alkali contaminants (i. e., Na{sup +}, K{sup +} and Cl{sup -}) showed much higher levels of these metals since they were mixed directly with the catalyst. The Fe-FT catalyst tested in 40 ppmw NaHCO{sub 3 } or KHCO{sub 3 } had 300 - 400 ppmw Na{sup +} or K{sup +} while testing in KCl resulted in 800 and 111 ppmw K{sup +} or Cl{sup -}, but these small amounts had no impact. A techno-economic trade-off analysis was carried out that evaluated the cost of cleaning up the syngas versus the added costs of premature catalyst replacement due to poisoning. Using the experimentally determined rates of catalyst deactivation, we estimated catalyst lifetimes to identify the critical deactivation rates that would require a syngas cleanup system to protect the catalysts. We found that in most cases a cleanup system would be economically justified. This project enabled us to determine the sensitivity of the WGS and FT catalysts used in CBTL processes to the contaminants in coal-biomass derived syngas, provided information on their service lifetimes, and will enable DOE and FTS technology developers to assess the risk of catalyst deactivation if these contaminants slip through syngas <b>clean-up</b> <b>systems.</b> We developed a fundamental understanding of the catalyst degradation mechanisms, which can help guide follow-on research on potential catalyst improvements and/or process modifications needed to reduce the capital and operating expenses of producing drop-in liquid fuels in CBTL plants.

40|$|AbstractExperimental {{model of}} {{fragment}} of header unit of light-water nuclear power reactor <b>clean-up</b> and cooldown <b>system</b> {{was developed and}} manufactured. Experimental studies of temperature conditions were performed using the developed experimental model. Experimental distributions of temperature in characteristic zones of the header unit under study were obtained. The most thermally stressed zones of heat-exchanging surface were determined. Analysis of intensity of temperature pulsations on the heat-exchanging surface and coolant flow in different zones was performed, statistical and spectral characteristics of temperature pulsations were represented. Solutions were suggested aimed at the reduction of intensity of thermal pulsations. Calculation model of the fragment of header unit was developed and recommendations were given {{on the development of}} calculation models. Results of numerical modeling of transient temperature conditions and characteristics of temperature pulsations for different regimes of flow streamlining the model obtained using ANSYS CFX 14. 0 CFD-code are presented here. Comparative analysis of experimental and calculated data was performed. It was demonstrated that calculated data are in agreement with experimental data with sufficient accuracy which gives the possibility to use the developed calculation model in the future for subsequent substantiation of heat exchanger design...|$|R
40|$|The coupled-column (LC-LC) system, {{consisting}} of a first column packed with internal surface reversed phase (ISRP) (50 x 4. 6 mm ID) and a Chrompack C 18 (100 x 4. 6 mm ID) as second column, allowed the simultaneous determination of five benzoylurea insecticides in dichloromethane (CH 2 Cl 2) extracts of vegetable samples without any <b>clean-up</b> step. This <b>system</b> was combined with a photochemically induced fluorescence (PIF) post-column derivatization {{in order to provide}} strongly fluorescent photoproducts from the non-fluorescent benzoylureas. Limits of detection ranged from 0. 21 to 0. 98 ug L– 1 of pesticide (equivalent to 0. 14 – 0. 65 ug kg– 1 in vegetable samples) and limits of determination ranged from 4. 0 to 10. 0 ug L– 1 (equivalent to 2. 7 – 6. 7 ug kg– 1). Linearity of the method was established between 2 and 1800 ug L– 1, depending upon the compound. Validation of the total method was performed by randomly analyzing recoveries of four vegetable samples (aubergine, cucumber, green bean, and tomato) spiked at two levels of concentration (10. 0 and 33. 3 ug kg– 1). The combination of the LC-LC system with PIF detection provides a sensitive, selective, and rapid method for the determination of pesticides in vegetable samples at levels lower than the maximum residue levels (MRLs) established for these compounds by Spanish legislation...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of our work}} {{was to develop a}} rapid, simple, and {{economical}} DNA extraction method for food (especially for meat products) analysis. This extraction and purification procedure was based on the three-phase partitioning (TPP) method. The developed new DNA-TPP method and Wizard DNA <b>Clean-Up</b> <b>System</b> (Promega, USA) have been compared concerning extraction efficiency, purity and DNA suitability for amplification. The quality and quantity of the purified DNA solutions were controlled by spectrophotometer and the amplification efficiency by simple qualitative PCR. All of prepared DNA solutions were pure enough for the PCR and contained appropriate quantity of DNA. Thus, 118 bp length amplicons could have been obtained by the specific lectin-gene PCR in all cases. This method proved to be an alternative one to isolate DNA from meat samples simply and economically...|$|E
30|$|The vanillate O-demethylase gene (VanABCE, CE 0634 –CE 0635) from C. efficiens was PCR-amplified (first reaction, 15 cycles) from C. efficiens NBRC 100395 (YS- 314) genomic DNA {{using the}} primer pair CE 0634 -up 300 F and CE 0635 -R (Table  1). KOD-FX DNA {{polymerase}} (TOYOBO, Japan) {{was used in}} the PCR reactions. The 2.75 -kbp fragment of CE 0634 -CE 0635 was purified using the SV Gel and PCR <b>Clean-Up</b> <b>System</b> (Promega) and used as template for 15 cycles of a second PCR reaction using the primer pair BglI-CE 0634 -up 300 -F and BglI-CE 0635 -R (Table  1). The amplified 2.83 -kbp fragment of CE 0634 -CE 0635 was fused to BglI-digested pCH using the InFusion Cloning Kit (Clontech Laboratories Inc, Mountain View, CA, USA).

30|$|The PCR amplified {{products}} of cloned aioA genes were purified using the Wizard PCR SV Gel and PCR <b>Clean-Up</b> <b>System</b> kit (Promega, USA). RFLP group representative purified PCR products were sequenced by ABI sequencer (ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer, USA) using forwards T 3 and reverse T 7 primers. Partial aioA gene sequences {{were subjected to}} BLASTN analysis ([URL] to identify the species exhibiting the most significant homologies. The nucleotide sequences of the As-metabolizing bacterial strains have been deposited in GenBank, and Phylogenetic trees of translated AioA amino acid sequences were generated using the neighbour-joining algorithms following the p-distance model in (Tamura et al. 2007). The level {{of support for the}} phylogenies, derived from neighbour-joining analysis, was determined from 1000 bootstrap replicates. The phylogenetic tree was drawn to scale with branch lengths shown in the same units as for inferred evolutionary distances.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{trend in}} Non-performing loans (NPLs) {{adversely}} affected availability of credits to economic agents in {{all sectors of}} the economy thereby constraining financial intermediation and economic activities. The study examined the trend and growth rates of NPLs in the Nigerian banking system during the major banking policy reforms regimes namely: pre-consolidation (1979 – 2004) and post consolidation era (2005 – 2014). Time series data collected were analyzed using descriptive and regression analyses. Results indicated irregular fluctuations in NPLs’ trend in both periods. This result suggested prevalent of high credit risk and corresponding reduction in lending capability of banks in the economy. Regression estimates of NPLs’ trend in the two regimes showed significant negative growth rates. This implies that, financial policies implemented in the country yielded positive impacts over time. NPLs assumed an exponential growth rate of - 1. 39 % and - 15. 55 % during the pre and post consolidated eras respectively. An average exponential growth rate of - 5. 2 % was obtained during the entire period. Quadratic trend analysis revealed that, increase influence of time variable significantly reduced NPLs during pre- consolidation regime and the entire period considered. However, this influence was stagnated during post consolidation period. Based on the result, it is recommended that, prudent lending coupled with swift and orderly <b>clean-up</b> of banking <b>system</b> loan portfolios should be adopted to decelerate NPLs trend and growth rate in Nigeria. Time is an important element in designing and implementing any banking and macroeconomic policy...|$|R
40|$|Coal {{gasification}} {{is becoming}} commercially even more import {{due to its}} potential application in hydrogen, ammonia, methanol and other chemicals and clean fuels production, other than power generation, together with carbon dioxide capture and sequestration. In this framework the technological development is also addressed, with a renewed interest, to simplified processes and plant solutions based, for example, on gasification with air (or air enriched with oxygen) and on moving or fluidised bed gasifiers, of interest for small and medium scale plants. The design, analysis and performance evaluation of the overall <b>system</b> (gasification, gas <b>clean-up,</b> desulphurisation, CO-shift conversion, CO 2 and hydrogen separation, etc.) require a preliminary estimation of gasifier mass and energy balances and raw gas composition, which influence the whole downstream gas <b>clean-up</b> and treatment <b>systems.</b> The present study reports a process analysis and performance evaluation of updraft moving bed gasifiers, which {{have been carried out}} by a computer simulation model developed using the Aspen Plus 12. 1 software, The model schematises the gasifier in several different zones: coal preheating and drying, devolatilization, gasification, combustion and oxidant preheating, under the hypothesis of char gasification at thermodynamic equilibrium. The model allows to appraise the mass and energy balance of the gasifier and the main characteristics of the syngas produced by the gasification process (composition, mass flow, temperature, lower heat value, etc.), being assigned coal composition and coal, steam and oxidant (air eventually enriched with oxigen) mass flows. In this paper the model is applied to predict the performance of two updraft moving bed gasifiers (sized respectively for 35 kg/h and 700 kg/h of low sulphur coal and high sulphur coal (Sulcis). The gasifiers are part of a small pilot gasification and gas treatment plant for hydrogen production under construction at the Sotacarbo Research Centre in Sardinia...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work was to develop, separately, methodology for production of two gaseous tracers through the sodium iodide NaI marked with 123 I. Found in the nature in form different, the iodine {{has been used in}} diverse works {{in the area of the}} industry and health. These two forms of the gaseous iodine, the methyl iodide, CH 3 I, and molecular iodine, I 2, are very unstable and volatile in the ambient temperature and presents different problems in <b>clean-up</b> and monitoring <b>systems.</b> The syntheses were processed with sodium iodide (NaI) 1 M aqueous solution marked with 123 I. The production of gas I 2 was realized with in chlorine acid (HCl) and sodium iodate salt (NaIO 3) and the CH 3 I was used, the salt of NaI and the reagent (CH 3) 2 SO 4. The production of gases was initially realized through in unit in glass with an inert material and the purpose was to study the kinetic of reaction and to determine the efficiency of production. The two synthesis occurs in the reaction bottle and after of produced, the gas is stored in the collect bottle that contains a starch solution for fixed the I 2, and in syntheses of CH 3 I contains a silver nitrate solution for your fixation. To determine the efficiency of production of gases, analytic tests were realized, where the consumption of iodide ions of the bottle of reaction are measured. The optimization of production of the each gaseous tracer was studied varying parameter as: concentration of iodide, concentration of acid and temperature. After, the syntheses of the radiotracers were realized in the compact unit, having been used as main reagent the salt radiated of sodium iodide, Na 123 I. The transportation of elementary iodine and methyl iodine was studied by a scintillation detector NaI (2 x 2) ” positioned in the reaction bottle...|$|R
