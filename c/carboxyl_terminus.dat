5|$|In {{response}} to cellular stresses– such as infection, heat shock, or oxidative damage– heat shock proteins that identify misfolded or unfolded proteins and target them for proteasomal degradation are expressed. Both Hsp27 and Hsp90—chaperone proteins have {{been implicated in}} increasing {{the activity of the}} ubiquitin-proteasome system, though they are not direct participants in the process. Hsp70, on the other hand, binds exposed hydrophobic patches on the surface of misfolded proteins and recruits E3 ubiquitin ligases such as CHIP to tag the proteins for proteasomal degradation. The CHIP protein (<b>carboxyl</b> <b>terminus</b> of Hsp70-interacting protein) is itself regulated via inhibition of interactions between the E3 enzyme CHIP and its E2 binding partner.|$|E
5|$|Translation is {{the process}} by which a mature mRNA {{molecule}} is used as a template for synthesizing a new protein. Translation is carried out by ribosomes, large complexes of RNA and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions to add new amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain by the formation of peptide bonds. The genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time, in units called codons, via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called transfer RNA (tRNA). Each tRNA has three unpaired bases known as the anticodon that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mRNA. The tRNA is also covalently attached to the amino acid specified by the complementary codon. When the tRNA binds to its complementary codon in an mRNA strand, the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new polypeptide chain, which is synthesized from amino terminus to <b>carboxyl</b> <b>terminus.</b> During and after synthesis, most new proteins must fold to their active three-dimensional structure before they can carry out their cellular functions.|$|E

40|$|Myogenin and MRF 4 {{belong to}} the MyoD family of muscle-specific {{transcription}} factors, which can activate myogenesis when introduced into nonmyogenic cells. These proteins share homology within a basic-helix-loop-helix motif that mediates DNA binding and dimerization, but they are divergent in their amino and <b>carboxyl</b> <b>termini.</b> Although myogenin and MRF 4 bind the same sequence within the muscle creatine kinase enhancer, only myogenin efficiently transactivates this enhancer. By creating chimeras of myogenin and MRF 4, we show that the specificities of these factors for transactivation of the muscle creatine kinase enhancer can be interchanged by swapping their amino and <b>carboxyl</b> <b>termini.</b> Within these chimeras, strong cooperation between the amino and <b>carboxyl</b> <b>termini</b> was observed.

2500|$|Preprolactase, {{the primary}} {{translation}} product, {{has a single}} polypeptide primary structure consisting of 1927 amino acids. [...] It {{can be divided into}} five domains: (i) a 19-amino-acid cleaved signal sequence; (ii) a large prosequence domain that is not present in mature lactase; (iii) the mature lactase segment; (iv) a membrane-spanning hydrophobic anchor; and (v) a short hydrophilic <b>carboxyl</b> <b>terminus.</b> [...] The signal sequence is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the resulting 215-kDa pro-LPH is sent to the Golgi apparatus, where it is heavily glycosylated and proteolytically processed to its mature form. [...] The prodomain has been shown to act as an intramolecular chaperone in the ER, preventing trypsin cleavage and allowing LPH to adopt the necessary 3-D structure to be transported to the Golgi apparatus.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was found}} that the {{reaction}} of chymotrypsin with its substrate takes place in two stages, an initial “burst” phase {{at the beginning of the}} reaction and a steady-state phase following Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The mode of action of chymotrypsin explains this as hydrolysis takes place in two steps. First acylation of the substrate to form an acyl-enzyme intermediate and then deacylation in order to return the enzyme to its original state. This occurs via the concerted action of the three amino acid residues in the catalytic triad. [...] Aspartate hydrogen bonds to the N-δ hydrogen of histidine, increasing the pKa of its ε nitrogen and thus making it able to deprotonate serine. It is this deprotonation that allows the serine side chain to act as a nucleophile and bind to the electron-deficient carbonyl carbon of the protein main chain. Ionization of the carbonyl oxygen is stabilized by formation of two hydrogen bonds to adjacent main chain N-hydrogens. This occurs in the oxyanion hole. This forms a tetrahedral adduct and breakage of the peptide bond. An acyl-enzyme intermediate, bound to the serine, is formed, and the newly formed amino terminus of the cleaved protein can dissociate. In the second reaction step, a water molecule is activated by the basic histidine, and acts as a nucleophile. The oxygen of water attacks the carbonyl carbon of the serine-bound acyl group, resulting in formation of a second tetrahedral adduct, regeneration of the serine -OH group, and release of a proton, as well as the protein fragment with the newly formed <b>carboxyl</b> <b>terminus</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{structure}} of a protein refers to the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain. The {{primary structure}} is held together by peptide bonds that are made {{during the process of}} protein biosynthesis. The two ends of the polypeptide chain are referred to as the <b>carboxyl</b> <b>terminus</b> (C-terminus) and the amino terminus (N-terminus) based {{on the nature of the}} free group on each extremity. Counting of residues always starts at the N-terminal end (NH2-group), which is the end where the amino group is not involved in a peptide bond. The primary {{structure of a}} protein is determined by the gene corresponding to the protein. A specific sequence of nucleotides in DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is read by the ribosome in a process called translation. The sequence of amino acids in insulin was discovered by Frederick Sanger, establishing that proteins have defining amino acid sequences. The sequence of a protein is unique to that protein, and defines the structure and function of the protein. The sequence of a protein can be determined by methods such as Edman degradation or tandem mass spectrometry. Often, however, it is read directly from the sequence of the gene using the genetic code. It is strictly recommended to use the words [...] "amino acid residues" [...] when discussing proteins because when a peptide bond is formed, a water molecule is lost, and therefore proteins are made up of amino acid residues. Post-translational modification such as disulfide bond formation, phosphorylations and glycosylations are usually also considered a part of the primary structure, and cannot be read from the gene. For example, insulin is composed of 51 amino acids in 2 chains. One chain has 31 amino acids, and the other has 20 amino acids.|$|E

40|$|The {{activity}} of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the distal nephron is regulated by an antidiuretic hormone, aldosterone, and insulin, but the molecular mechanisms that mediate these hormonal effects are mostly unknown. We have investigated whether aldosterone, insulin, or activation of protein kinases {{has an effect on}} the phosphorylation of the channel. Experiments were performed in an epithelial cell line generated by stable cotransfection of the three subunits (α, β, and γ) of ENaC. We found that β and γ, but not the α subunit, are phosphorylated in the basal state. Aldosterone, insulin, and protein kinases A and C increased phosphorylation of the β and γ subunits in their <b>carboxyl</b> <b>termini,</b> but none of these agents induced de novo phosphorylation of α subunits.

The amino termini of nine Sas- 6 dimers form a central hub of ∼ 12 nm radius from which nine dimer spokes radiate, placing the Sas- 6 <b>carboxyl</b> <b>termini</b> at {{the outer edge}} of the ∼ 60 nm radius cartwheel [2]. Several centriole proteins are distributed in a toroid around the cartwheel, and super-resolution light microscopy studies have measured the average radii of these ∼ 100 – 200 nm radius toroids with a ‘precision’ — or standard deviation (s. d. or 1 σ) — of ±∼ 10 – 40 nm. The organization of Ana 2 /STIL within the cartwheel, however, has not been resolvable. Here, we develop methods to calculate the average toroidal radius of centriolar proteins in the ∼ 20 – 60 nm range with a s. d. of just ±∼ 4 – 5 nm, revealing that the amino and <b>carboxyl</b> <b>termini</b> of Ana 2 are located in the outer cartwheel region...|$|R

Members of the MyoD family bind DNA preferentially as heterooligomers with the widely expressed HLH proteins E 12 and E 47 (3, 5, 8, 9, 11, 20, 21).

40|$|Keratinocyte {{growth factor}} (KGF) {{is a member}} of the {{fibroblast}} growth factor (FGF) family. FGFs are also known as heparin-binding growth factors because they bind to heparin and their physical and biological properties are modulated by heparin. Consistent with a role as a paracrine effector, KGF is produced by cells of mesenchymal origin but is active primarily, if not exclusively, on epithelial cells. KGF is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including proliferation, differentiation, wound healing, and cytoprotection. To identify regions in KGF that contribute to heparin and tyrosine kinase receptor interactions, nine peptides spanning defined motifs in the predicted structure of KGF were synthesized, and their heparin and receptor binding properties were analyzed. Peptides at the amino and <b>carboxyl</b> <b>termini</b> bound heparin, and one peptide showed relative binding comparable to that of KGF. Competitive binding studies showed that this peptide along with two other overlapping peptides specifically displaced KGF bound to the KGF receptor. These three peptides were also selectively recognized by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against KGF, though only in the presence of heparin. Together, these data suggest that the sites for heparin and receptor binding both reside in the amino and <b>carboxyl</b> <b>termini</b> of KGF, which are spatially juxtaposed in the predicted three-dimensional structure of this molecule...|$|R
