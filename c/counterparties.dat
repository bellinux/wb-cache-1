5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed an {{agreement}} known as the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit spending and debt levels. Some EU member states, including Greece and Italy, were able to circumvent these rules and mask their deficit and debt levels {{through the use of}} complex currency and credit derivatives structures. The structures were designed by prominent US investment banks, who received substantial fees in return for their services and who took on little credit risk themselves thanks to special legal protections for derivatives <b>counterparties.</b> Financial reforms within the U.S. since the financial crisis have only served to reinforce special protections for derivatives—including greater access to government guarantees—while minimising disclosure to broader financial markets.|$|E

25|$|On March 15, 2009, AIG {{disclosed}} that, {{among its}} <b>counterparties,</b> Société Générale was {{to date the}} largest recipient of both credit default swap (CDS) collateral postings ($4.1 bn) and CDS payments ($6.9 bn), payments made possible {{in part by the}} 2008 U.S. government bailout of AIG.|$|E
25|$|American International Group {{received}} $180 {{billion in}} government loans during the financial crisis. The money {{was used to}} repay customers of its security-lending program and was paid as collateral to <b>counterparties</b> under credit insurance contracts purchased from AIG. However, due to the size {{and nature of the}} payouts, there was considerable controversy in the media and amongst some politicians as to whether banks, including Goldman Sachs, should have been forced to take greater losses and should not have been paid in full in full via government loans to AIG. The New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced in March 2009 that he was investigating whether AIG's trading <b>counterparties</b> improperly received government money. Goldman Sachs was a major beneficiary of the government loans to AIG and received $12.9 billion during the unwind of credit default swap (CDS) contracts by AIG after receiving the government loans.|$|E
25|$|By {{avoiding}} an exchange, {{users of}} OTC options can narrowly tailor {{the terms of}} the option contract to suit individual business requirements. In addition, OTC option transactions generally {{do not need to be}} advertised to the market and face little or no regulatory requirements. However, OTC <b>counterparties</b> must establish credit lines with each other, and conform to each other's clearing and settlement procedures.|$|E
50|$|Another {{dimension}} of CFD risk is <b>counterparty</b> risk, {{a factor in}} most over-the-counter (OTC) traded derivatives. <b>Counterparty</b> risk {{is associated with the}} financial stability or solvency of the <b>counterparty</b> to a contract. In the context of CFD contracts, if the <b>counterparty</b> to a contract fails to meet their financial obligations, the CFD may have little or no value regardless of the underlying instrument. This means that a CFD trader could potentially incur severe losses, even if the underlying instrument moves in the desired direction. OTC CFD providers are required to segregate client funds protecting client balances in event of company default, but cases such as that of MF Global remind us that guarantees can be broken. Exchange-traded contracts traded through a clearing house are generally believed to have less <b>counterparty</b> risk. Ultimately, the degree of <b>counterparty</b> risk is defined by the credit risk of the <b>counterparty,</b> including the clearing house if applicable.|$|R
50|$|OTC {{derivatives}} {{can lead}} to significant risks. Especially <b>counterparty</b> risk has gained particular emphasis due to the credit crisis in 2007. <b>Counterparty</b> risk is the risk that a <b>counterparty</b> in a derivatives transaction will default prior to expiration of the trade and will not make the current and future payments required by the contract. There {{are many ways to}} limit <b>counterparty</b> risk. One of them focuses on controlling credit exposure with diversification, netting, collateralisation and hedging.|$|R

25|$|Investment bank {{securitize}}rs {{were more}} willing to securitize risky loans because they generally retained minimal risk. Whereas the GSEs guaranteed {{the performance of their}} MBSs, private securitizers generally did not, and might only retain a thin slice of risk. Often, banks would offload this risk to insurance companies or other <b>counterparties</b> through credit default swaps, making their actual risk exposures extremely difficult for investors and creditors to discern.|$|E
25|$|Clients hold {{a margin}} account with the exchange, {{and every day}} the swings {{in the value of}} their {{positions}} is added to or deducted from their margin account. If the margin account gets too low, they have to replenish it. In this way {{it is highly unlikely that}} the client will not be able to fulfill his obligations arising from the contracts. As the clearing house is the counterparty to all their trades, they only have to have one margin account. This is in contrast with OTC derivatives, where issues such as margin accounts have to be negotiated with all <b>counterparties.</b>|$|E

25|$|The company faced {{financial}} trouble from 2002, {{when it first}} approached the British government for financial aid. This followed a slump in wholesale energy prices, a failure to obtain relaxations on the Climate Change Levy, and renegotiations of its back-end fuel costs with BNFL, as well as issues {{with a number of}} its reactors (resulting in much capacity being offline during critical periods of the company financial crisis) and a failure to complete a timely sale of its joint-venture share in AmerGen.

25|$|Most large {{derivatives}} exchanges operate their own clearing houses, {{allowing them to}} take revenues from post-trade processing as well as trading itself. By netting off the different positions traded, a smaller amount of capital is required as security to cover the trades. Of the big derivatives venues Chicago Mercantile Exchange, ICE and Eurex all clear trades themselves. There is sometimes a division of responsibility between provision of trading facility, and that of clearing and settlement of those trades. Derivative exchanges like the CBOE and LIFFE take responsibility for providing the trading environments, settlement of the resulting trades are usually handled by clearing houses that serve as central <b>counterparties</b> to trades done in the respective exchanges. The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) and LCH.Clearnet (London Clearing House) respectively are the clearing corporations for CBOE and LIFFE, although LIFFE and parent NYSE Euronext has long stated its desire to develop its own clearing service.|$|E
25|$|Derivative {{contracts}} are leveraged positions whose value is volatile. They are usually more volatile than their underlying asset. This {{can lead to}} credit risk, in particular counterparty risk: {{a situation in which}} one party to a trade loses such a large sum of money that it is unable to honor its settlement obligation. In a safe trading environment, the parties to a trade need to be assured that the <b>counterparties</b> will honor the trade, no matter how the market has moved. This requirement can lead to complex arrangements like credit assessments and the setting of trading limits for each counterparty, thus removing many of the advantages of a centralised trading facility. To prevent this, a clearing house interposes itself as a counterparty to every trade, in order to extend a guarantee that the trade will be settled as originally intended. This action is called novation. As a result, trading firms take no risk on the actual counterparty to the trade, but instead the risk falls on the clearing corporation performing a service called central counterparty clearing. The clearing corporation is able to take on this risk by adopting an efficient margining process.|$|E

However, {{there is still the}} risk that <b>counterparty</b> may default without going through severe downgrade. This article presents a practical model for valuating CVA in the presence of ATE. ...|$|R

2500|$|Some general {{criticism}} of financial derivatives is also relevant to credit derivatives. [...] Warren Buffett famously described derivatives bought speculatively as [...] "financial {{weapons of mass}} destruction." [...] In Berkshire Hathaway's annual report to shareholders in 2002, he said, [...] "Unless derivatives contracts are collateralized or guaranteed, their ultimate value also depends on the creditworthiness of the <b>counterparties</b> to them. In the meantime, though, before a contract is settled, the <b>counterparties</b> record profits and losses—often huge in amount—in their current earnings statements {{without so much as}} a penny changing hands. The range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or sometimes, so it seems, madmen)." ...|$|E
2500|$|The IRB {{approach}} {{relies on}} a bank's own assessment of its <b>counterparties</b> and exposures to calculate capital requirements for credit risk.

25|$|A {{synthetic}} ETF has <b>counterparty</b> risk, {{because the}} <b>counterparty</b> is contractually obligated {{to match the}} return on the index. The deal is arranged with collateral posted by the swap <b>counterparty.</b> A potential hazard is that the investment bank offering the ETF might post its own collateral, and that collateral could be of dubious quality. Furthermore, the investment bank could use its own trading desk as <b>counterparty.</b> These types of set-ups are not allowed under the European guidelines, Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS), so the investor should look for UCITS III-compliant funds.|$|R
5000|$|One area {{in which}} a party to an OTC {{transaction}} can be attacked by its <b>counterparty,</b> if the transactions [...] "goes south", is if the <b>counterparty</b> was relying on the party {{in relation to the}} transaction and the party owes either some kind of fiduciary relationship to the <b>counterparty</b> or has engaged in misleading conduct in inducing the <b>counterparty</b> to enter into the trade. In this regard the principles of equity, contract, and trade practices law apply to OTC derivatives {{in the same way as}} they apply to other contracts.|$|R
25|$|To {{minimize}} <b>counterparty</b> risk to traders, trades executed on regulated futures exchanges {{are guaranteed}} by a clearing house. The clearing house becomes the buyer to each seller, and the seller to each buyer, {{so that in}} the event of a <b>counterparty</b> default the clearer assumes the risk of loss. This enables traders to transact without performing due diligence on their <b>counterparty.</b>|$|R
2500|$|During the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, <b>counterparties</b> became {{subject to}} a risk of default, amplified with the involvement of Lehman Brothers and AIG in {{a very large number}} of CDS transactions. [...] This is an example of systemic risk, risk which threatens an entire market, and a number of commentators have argued that size and deregulation of the CDS market have increased this risk.|$|E
2500|$|Explosive {{growth was}} not without {{operational}} headaches. [...] On September 15, 2005, the New York Fed summoned 14 banks to its offices.

This created severe risk management issues, as <b>counterparties</b> were in legal and financial limbo. U.K. authorities expressed the same concerns.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "credit default swap" [...] (CDS) is {{a credit}} {{derivative}} contract between two <b>counterparties.</b> [...] The buyer makes periodic {{payments to the}} seller, and in return receives a payoff if an underlying financial instrument defaults or experiences a similar credit event. The CDS may refer to a specified loan or bond obligation of a “reference entity”, usually a corporation or government.|$|E
40|$|The {{price of}} {{financial}} derivative with unilateral <b>counterparty</b> credit risk {{can be expressed}} {{as the price of}} an otherwise risk-free derivative minus a credit value adjustment(CVA) component that can be seen as shorting a call option, which is exercised upon default of <b>counterparty,</b> on MtM of the derivative. Therefore, modeling volatility of MtM and default time of <b>counterparty</b> is key to quantification of <b>counterparty</b> risk. This paper models default times of <b>counterparty</b> and reference with a particular contagion model with stochastic intensities that is proposed by Bao et al. 2010. Stochastic interest rate is incorporated as well to account for positive correlation between spread and interest. Survival measure approach is adopted to calculate MtM of risk-free CDS and conditional survival probability of <b>counterparty</b> in defaultable environment. Semi-analytical solution for CVA is attained. Affine specification of intensities and interest rate concludes analytical expression for pre-default value of MtM. Numerical experiments at the last of this paper analyze the impact of contagion, volatility and correlation on CVA. ...|$|R
