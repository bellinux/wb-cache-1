40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel chassis structure for advanced mobility platforms, using <b>caster</b> <b>wheels</b> with disturbance observers, and independent driving motors. The system {{consists of two}} independent driving <b>wheels</b> and two <b>caster</b> <b>wheels.</b> The proposed configuration enables the vehicle to have: a low mechanical stiffness against the direct yaw moment input because <b>caster</b> <b>wheels</b> are free to rotate; and high static stability because of the four wheels having a large base geometry. In addition, by introducing disturbance observers, the vehicle was given enhanced mobility and safety characteristics. A number of advantages, which include small-radius turning, under-steer gradient control, load transfer estimation, of the proposed system are shown and discussed with experimental results throughout the paper...|$|R

5000|$|The Melroe brothers, of Melroe Manufacturing Company in Gwinner, N.D., {{purchased}} {{the rights to}} the Keller loader in 1958 and hired the Kellers to continue refining their invention. As a result of this partnership, the M-200 Melroe self-propelled loader was introduced at the end of 1958. It featured two independent front-drive wheels and a rear <b>caster</b> <b>wheel,</b> a [...] engine and a 750 lb lift capacity. Two years later they replaced the <b>caster</b> <b>wheel</b> with a rear axle and introduced the M-400, the first four-wheel, true skid-steer loader. The M-440 was powered by a [...] engine and had an 1100 lb rated operating capacity. Skid-steer development continued into the mid-1960s with the M600 loader.|$|E
5000|$|Yoke: The part of {{a swivel}} or rigid caster and can be {{considered}} a frame. The caster yoke serves to hold the wheel in place. The yoke, working with a swivel head allows the <b>caster</b> <b>wheel</b> to operate in a 360 degree manner. The yoke is also known as the fork, rig or housing.|$|E
50|$|The first three-wheeled, {{front-end}} loader {{was invented by}} brothers Cyril and Louis Keller in Rothsay, Minnesota, in 1957. The Kellers built the loader to help a farmer, Eddie Velo, mechanize the process of cleaning turkey manure from his barn. The light and compact machine, with its rear <b>caster</b> <b>wheel,</b> was able to turn around within its own length, while performing the same tasks as a conventional {{front-end loader}}.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{health and safety}} {{organizations}} that enforce and regulate the allowable forces and noise levels that casters can make on a plant floor, and include the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). For example, CCOHS recommends that the maximum horizontal force someone should exert is 50 lbf. Liberty Mutual has also produced a Snook Table that provides the percent population {{of male and female}} able to push at a given horizontal force. This force can be adjusted to a safe level by providing the right <b>caster</b> <b>wheel</b> material and rig.|$|E
50|$|The 152 mm {{howitzer}} 2A65 (M1987) {{is mounted}} on a conventional split trail carriage and, when deployed in the firing position, rests on three points, the hydraulic circular firing jack under the forward part of the carriage and the two spades at the rear. Each of the box section trails has a <b>caster</b> <b>wheel</b> to assist the gun crew in bringing the weapon into action. When deployed in the firing position, these swing upwards through 180° and rest {{on top of each}} trail. The 152 mm ordnance is fitted with a muzzle brake and a semi-automatic breech mechanism, spring-operated ramming system, hydraulic counter-recoil device and a liquid-cooled recoil brake. Elevation and traverse is manual, two-speed, with the direct and indirect sighting devices being located {{on the left side of}} the weapon. Pneumatic brakes are fitted as standard.|$|E
5000|$|The Ladybird is {{a roughly}} {{hemispherical}} robot which is 40 cm wide, 25 cm tall and 60 cm long. It has a metal baseplate {{on which the}} electronics lie, which are enclosed by a red shell with black spots. This shell was originally varnished papier-mâché, but due to deterioration, the Ladybird now has a plastic shell mimicking the original one. The black spots themselves are buttons, {{and the top of}} the shell also has a small sliding vane. The robot has two red [...] "eyes" [...] (which can light up but can't see), three photosensors (which can detect light) and a mechanical sensor in the front to detect collisions with obstacles. It also contains an electromechanical buzzer to give audible feedback. Due to the technical difficulties of the time, Muszka couldn't include a battery, and so the Ladybird gets the required electricity (220 V alternating current from the mains) using an umbilical power cable. The machine has three rubber wheels, two fixed wheels in front which are driven by automobile windscreen wiper motors, and a free-rotating <b>caster</b> <b>wheel</b> at the back. By design, the Ladybird is incapable of going in reverse.|$|E
50|$|To {{ensure the}} design {{integrity}} of casters, the Institute of <b>Caster</b> and <b>Wheel</b> Manufacturers (ICWM) working {{in collaboration with}} the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has developed the ANSI ICWM: 2012 The ICWM Performance Standard for <b>Casters</b> and <b>Wheels</b> which is intended to provide manufacturers, specifiers and users with a common basis for evaluating the safety, durability, structural adequacy and technical requirements for group specific <b>casters</b> and <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{full-scale}} {{investigation has}} been conducted {{to determine the effect}} of various factors on the shimmy of <b>castering</b> <b>wheels.</b> The factors considered were the geometric arrangement, the tire types, the variations of load, the spindle moment of inertia, and the tire inflation. A comparison {{of the results of the}} present investigation with those calculated from existing theory was made. The constants needed in the calculations to determine the damping required for a <b>castering</b> <b>wheel</b> were measured. The results indicate that solid friction appears to be impracticable as the sole damping agent for <b>castering</b> nose <b>wheels</b> on large airplanes. Also it was concluded that the existing theory is adequate for calculating the damping required to prevent shimmy. The caster angle and the spindle moment of inertia were found to influence the solid friction required to prevent shimmy. The effect of variations in the type and the pressure of the tire was insignificant...|$|R
5000|$|The Radio Flyer Ziggle, {{introduced}} in 2013, is a ride-on toy for kids 3 to 8 with four <b>caster</b> <b>wheels</b> and no pedals. Kids propel forward by wiggling and twisting {{their bodies in}} a {{back and forth motion}} and moving the handle bars at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{steering}} axis (the red dotted {{line in the}} diagram above) {{does not have to}} pass through the centre of the wheel, so the caster can be set independently of the mechanical trail, which is the distance between where the {{steering axis}} hits the ground, in side view, and the point directly below the axle. The interaction between caster angle and trail is complex, but roughly speaking they both aid steering, caster tends to add damping, while trail adds 'feel', and returnability. In the extreme case, such as the <b>caster</b> <b>wheel</b> on a shopping trolley, the system is undamped but stable, as the wheel oscillates around the 'correct' path. The shopping trolley/cart setup {{has a great deal of}} trail, but (somewhat confusingly) no caster. Complicating this still further is that the [...] forces at the tyre do not act at the centre of the contact patch, but at a distance behind the nominal contact patch. This distance is called the pneumatic trail and varies with speed, load, steer angle, surface, tyre type, tyre pressure and time. A good starting point for this is 30 mm behind the nominal contact patch.|$|E
50|$|The M5 Bomb Trailer is a 2½ ton {{capacity}} vehicle {{used during}} World War II for transporting bombs from munitions storage areas to the aircraft for loading. Up to six M5s can be towed in a train. The trailer weighs 7,200 pounds when fully loaded.The front {{pair of wheels}} are mounted on a caster assembly like a shopping cart. They are free to rotate 360 degrees about their vertical axis. There is a damper assembly that resembles 1/2 of a disk brake rotor that has friction pucks pressing against it to dampen oscillations of the caster assembly. These trailers would be towed out to the flightline all hitched together like a train and the train would stop at the first bomber and the last trailer in the train would be disconnected. The train would then continue {{on to the next}} bomber. After the train left, the crew would manhandle the trailer to a position under the bomber to enable the loading of the bombs. The front <b>caster</b> <b>wheel</b> assembly made this relatively easy. And so each trailer would be detached and when the towing vehicle had left the last trailer, it would circle around and go back and pick up the now empty first trailer detached. Then it would proceed to pick the rest of the trailers, one at a time.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the position estimation of mobile robot by sensing <b>caster</b> <b>wheel</b> motion. A mathematical model is developed {{to determine the}} position of mobile robot by sensing the angular velocity and heading angle of the <b>caster</b> <b>wheel.</b> Using the established equations, simulations were carried out using MATLAB version 8. 6 to observe and verify the position coordinates of mobile robot and in turn obtain its trajectory. The simulation {{results show that the}} angular velocity of <b>caster</b> <b>wheel</b> and heading angle calculated from the sensor output readings with the help of inverse kinematics equations matches well with that of actual values given as input for simulation.
