5|$|As American forces {{continued}} to approach Luzon, the Japanese Imperial High Command ordered that all able-bodied POWs be transported to Japan. From the Cabanatuan <b>camp,</b> over 1,600 soldiers were removed in October1944, leaving over 500sick, weak, or disabled POWs. On January6, 1945, {{all of the}} guards withdrew from the Cabanatuan <b>camp,</b> leaving the POWs alone. The guards had previously told prisoner leaders {{that they should not}} attempt to escape, or else they would be killed. When the guards left, the prisoners heeded the threat, fearing that the Japanese were waiting near the <b>camp</b> and would use the attempted escape as an excuse to execute them all. Instead, the prisoners went to the guards' side of the <b>camp</b> and ransacked the Japanese buildings for supplies and large amounts of food. Prisoners were alone for several weeks, except when retreating Japanese forces would periodically stay in the <b>camp.</b> The soldiers mainly ignored the POWs, except to ask for food. Although aware of the consequences, the prisoners sent a small group outside the prison's gates to bring in twocarabaos to slaughter. The meat from the animals, along with the food secured from the Japanese side of the <b>camp,</b> helped many of the POWs to regain their strength, weight, and stamina. In mid-January, a large group of Japanese troops entered the <b>camp</b> and returned the prisoners to their side of the <b>camp.</b> The prisoners, fueled by rumors, speculated that they would soon be executed by the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of May, Operation Bernhard was officially closed down and the prisoners were transported from the caves to the nearby Ebensee {{concentration}} <b>camp.</b> They were divided into three groups, and a truck was to make trips {{to and from the}} <b>camp.</b> An order had been issued that the prisoners were to be killed, but only once they were together at Ebensee. The truck delivered the first two groups to the <b>camp,</b> where the men were housed separately from the general <b>camp</b> population. On the third journey the vehicle broke down after it had picked up the final group of prisoners; the men in the last group were marched to the <b>camp,</b> which took two days. As the order had specified that the prisoners had to be killed together, the first two groups were kept safe to await their comrades. Because of the delay with the third journey and the close proximity of the advancing Allied army, on 5 May the first two groups were released from their isolation into the general population and their SS guards fled. That afternoon the third group arrived at the <b>camp.</b> When the guards learned {{what had happened to the}} first two groups, they also released their prisoners into the main prison population and fled.
