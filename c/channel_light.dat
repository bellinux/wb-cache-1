500|$|In Chaco Canyon, {{the center}} of the ancient Pueblo culture in the American Southwest, {{numerous}} solar and lunar light markings and architectural and road alignments have been documented. These findings date to the 1977 discovery of the Sun Dagger site by Anna Sofaer. Three large stone slabs leaning against a cliff <b>channel</b> <b>light</b> and shadow markings onto two spiral petroglyphs on the cliff wall, marking the solstices, equinoxes and the lunar standstills of the 18.6 year cycle of the moon. Subsequent [...] research by the Solstice Project and others demonstrated [...] that numerous building and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon are oriented to solar, lunar and cardinal directions. In addition, research shows that the Great North Road, a thirty-five mile engineered “road”, was constructed [...] not for utilitarian purposes but rather to connect the ceremonial center of Chaco Canyon with the direction north.|$|E

50|$|The Munising Front Range Light and its {{matching}} Munising Rear Range Light {{replaced the}} ineffective Grand Island East <b>Channel</b> <b>Light</b> in 1905.

The history of these lighthouses is documented by Terry Pepper and is not reproduced here.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} was rendered obsolete {{by the development}} of light-emitting diodes (LED) in the 1970s, though lightguide tubes are still used in electronics manufacturing, in situations where it is difficult to place an LED in the appropriate physical location on a display or bezel. In such cases, LEDs mounted on printed circuit boards are fitted with lightguides to <b>channel</b> <b>light</b> to the appropriate position. This employs the same principle used in optical fibers.|$|E

50|$|By {{this time}} a new North Channel was being dredged, and {{it came to be}} the {{preferred}} route. Therefore when Fort Standish was being rebuilt in 1939, the Lovells Island lights were removed, leaving the Broad Sound <b>Channel</b> <b>lights</b> as the only markers for any part of the old route other than buoys marking specific shoals. The lights were finally discontinued and removed around 1950. Fill from the Big Dig has been used to expand and raise the island, eliminating every trace of the old lights.|$|R

5000|$|Basil Hirschowitz and Larry Curtiss {{invented the}} first fiber optic {{endoscope}} in 1957. Earlier in the 1950s Harold Hopkins had designed a [...] "fibroscope" [...] {{consisting of a}} bundle of flexible glass fibres able to coherently transmit an image. This proved useful both medically and industrially, and subsequent research led to further improvements in image quality. Further innovations included using additional fibres to <b>channel</b> <b>light</b> to the objective end from a powerful external source, thereby achieving {{the high level of}} full spectrum illumination that was needed for detailed viewing, and colour photography.|$|E
5000|$|The Grand Island East <b>Channel</b> <b>Light</b> is a {{lighthouse}} located {{just north of}} Munising, Michigan and was intended to lead boats from Lake Superior through the channel east of Grand Island into the Munising Harbor. Constructed of wood, the light first opened for service in 1868. The light {{was very hard to}} see from Lake Superior, and light maintenance was very difficult so the Munising Range Lights were constructed (Munising Rear Range Light, Munising Front Range Light) and this light was removed from service in 1908 or 1913 (sources vary).|$|E
50|$|Nanofabricated {{systems that}} exploit SPPs {{demonstrate}} potential for designing and controlling {{the propagation of}} light in matter. In particular, SPPs {{can be used to}} <b>channel</b> <b>light</b> efficiently into nanometer scale volumes, leading to direct modification of resonate frequency dispersion properties (substantially shrinking the wavelength of light and the speed of light pulses for example), as well as field enhancements suitable for enabling strong interactions with nonlinear materials. The resulting enhanced sensitivity of light to external parameters (for example, an applied electric field or the dielectric constant of an adsorbed molecular layer) shows great promise for applications in sensing and switching.|$|E
