40|$|A 3 D {{arrangement}} graph G is {{the abstract}} graph induced by {{an arrangement of}} planes in general position where the intersection of any two planes forms a line of intersection and an intersection of three planes creates a point. The properties of three <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrangement</b> graphs — four, five and six planes — are investigated. For graphs induced from six planes, specialized methods were developed to ensure all possible graphs were discovered. The main results are: the number of 3 D arrangement graphs induced by four, five and six planes are one, one and 43 respectively; the three classes are Hamiltonian; and the 3 D arrangement graphs created from four and five planes are planar {{but none of the}} graphs created from six planes are planar. iii Acknowledgements First, I wish to thank my supervisor, Stephen Wismath, for his encouragement, guidance, and kindness throughout the process.

In particular in dimension two any line arrangement can be represented isomorphically by lines with any given set of distinct slopes of the same cardinality. As a consequence we have a coarse classification where we show that there is a bijection between isomorphism <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> K-hyperplane <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> a fixed cardinality modulo translations and isomorphism classes on K-normal systems of the same fixed cardinality for any dense subfield K⊂F (refer to Theorem 6 and Note 12).
