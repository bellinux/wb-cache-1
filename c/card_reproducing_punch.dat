5000|$|GIP (General Interpretive Programme) was {{a control}} program for {{manipulating}} programs called [...] "bricks". Its principal service {{was in the}} running of programs from the several hundred in the DEUCE linear algebra library. Preparation of such a program involved selecting the required bricks (on punch cards), copying them and GIP in a <b>reproducing</b> <b>punch,</b> and assembling the copies into a deck of cards. Next, simple codewords would be written to use the bricks to perform such tasks as: matrix multiplication; matrix inversion; term-by-term matrix arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division); solving simultaneous equations; input; and output. The dimensions of matrices were never specified in the codewords. Dimensions {{were taken from the}} matrices themselves, either from a card preceding the data cards, or from the matrices as stored on drum. Thus, programs were entirely general. Once written, such a program handled any size of matrices (up to the capacity of the drum, of course).|$|R

2500|$|Hirst's {{first major}} {{international}} presentation {{was in the}} Venice Biennale in 1993 with the work, Mother and Child Divided, a cow and a calf cut into sections and exhibited {{in a series of}} separate vitrines. He curated the show Some Went Mad, Some Ran Away in 1994 at the Serpentine Gallery in London, where he exhibited Away from the Flock (a sheep in a tank of formaldehyde). On 9 May, Mark Bridger, a 35-year-old artist from Oxford, walked into the gallery and poured black ink into the tank, and retitled the work Black Sheep. [...] He was subsequently prosecuted, at Hirst's wish, and was given two years' probation. The sculpture was restored at a cost of £1,000. When a photograph of Away from the Flock was reproduced in the 1997 book by Hirst I want {{to spend the rest of}} my life everywhere, with everyone, one-to-one, always, forever, now, the vandalism was referenced by allowing the tank to be obscured by pulling a <b>card,</b> <b>reproducing</b> the effect of ink being poured into the tank; this resulted in Hirst being sued by Bridger for violating his copyright on Black Sheep.|$|R

50|$|The UltraSound cards gained great {{popularity}} in the PC tracker music community. The tracker format was originally developed on the Commodore Amiga personal computer in 1987, but due to the PC becoming more capable of producing high-quality graphics and sound, the demo scene spilled out onto the platform in droves and took the tracker format with it. Typical tracker formats of the era included MOD, S3M and, later, XM. The format stores the notes and the instruments digitally in the file instead of relying on a sound <b>card</b> to <b>reproduce</b> the instruments. A tracker module, when saved to disk, typically incorporates all the sequencing data plus samples, and typically the composer would incorporate his or her assumed name into the list of samples. This primitive precursor to the modern sampler {{opened the way for}} Gravis to enter the market, because the requirements matched the capabilities of the GF1 chip ideally. The problem with the other sound cards playing this format was that they had to downmix voices into one or both of its output channels in software, further deteriorating the quality of 8-bit samples in process. An UltraSound card was able to download the samples to its RAM and mix them using fast and high-quality hardware implementation, offloading the CPU from the task. Gravis realized early on that the demo scene support could be a sales booster, and they gave away 6000 cards for free to the most famous scene groups and people in the scene.|$|R

Morris (chairman of the special nursing committee of the Red Cross) : “The war has drawn heavily on the normal supply of trained nurses and as a step in preparation for what may come, we must enroll every woman who can give intelligent help. Over a thousand Denver women have taken the Red Corss [sic] course of instruction for nurses’ aides, and it is expected all of these will report at once for this emergency duty. The order received from Washington authorizes us to pay $ 75 per month and expenses to graduate nurses, and from $ 30 to $ 50 and expenses to aides and undergraduates, where this is necessary, but {{it is expected that}} those able to volunteer without pay will do so. ”• Red Cross will fund nursing services to communities or families who cannot afford the service. • As soon as nurses are enrolled, they will be placed, according to the discretion of the emergency committee appointed by Dr. Sharpley. • The voluntary nurse registration will be followed by door-to-door canvass of the entire United States by women’s councils of defense under the authority of the Red Cross.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} slabs supported on columns fail by punching when a conical plug of concrete perforates the slab above the column. This failure has been mostly investigated experimentally, {{so what can}} numerical simulation contribute to understand this phenomenon? To answer this question, a computational simulation tool based on the finite element method is developed. This numerical model is implemented into a computer code in applying the object-oriented programming concept. The requirements that the numerical model should fulfill are derived from {{a review of the}} experimental results published in the literature and obtained in our laboratory. The numerical model reproduces the non-linear material behavior characterizing reinforced concrete structures by decoupling the actions of steel reinforcement and concrete. The steel reinforcement is represented by uniaxial truss elements which follow a bi-linear stress-strain response. The concrete is modeled with continuum elements which are described at the constitutive level {{within the framework of the}} incremental flow theory of plasticity. The concrete triaxial strength is delimitated with a new failure criterion. A plastic flow rule is derived so as to reproduce the evolution of the plastic strain observed experimentally. Cracking induces strain-softening which refers to a gradual decrease in tensile strength with increasing deformations. The reduction of the tensile strength is controlled by an isotropic decohesion process which is monitored by constant fracture energy. The stiffness degradation due to cracking is reproduced with an isotropic elastic damage model. A perfect bond between concrete and steel is assumed. The capabilities of the numerical model are illustrated by simulating the localized shear failure in soil under a footing, the uniaxial tensile, and the confined compressive tests in plain and reinforced concrete specimens. The simulation of punching failure is investigated for three circular reinforced {{concrete slabs}}. The comparison with experimental results indicates that: (1) the punching failure mechanism –characterized by a localized inclined punching crack– is generated, (2) the value of the punching load is predicted, (3) the cracking sequence is reproduced, (4) the global response is slightly too stiff. For slabs with orthogonal reinforcement, the perfect bond hypothesis does not allow to capture the punching failure mechanism and the numerical model is improved by relaxing this hypothesis. The developed computational simulation tool <b>reproduces</b> the <b>punching</b> failure observed experimentally and is consequently used to investigate the failure mechanism. First, it is shown that the punching crack results from a crack coalescence phenomenon at the top of the slab followed by a crack propagation in the direction of the corner slab-column. Second, a condition for punching failure to occur is determined. Third, it is illustrated that the size-effect observed experimentally is reproduced and is reflected by a modification of the tensile stress distribution along the punching crack. Finally, a parametric study of the punching failure is performed revealing that punching failure is governed by the tensile strength of concrete. It is also shown that increasing the percentage of reinforcement raises the punching load and reduces the ductility of failure. Lastly, the computational simulation tool allows to demonstrate that in a circular slab, the applied bending moment is not determinant for the value of the punching load...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of research regarding the mnemonic abilities of primary school children with developmental delays. Empirical studies of impaired mental development offer an opportunity to elucidate the psychological mechanisms underlying the process of normal development and enable us to consider at a micro level the formation of mental processes in ontogeny, which would, under normal conditions, be nondescript and not always amenable to psychological analysis. The research addresses an experimental investigation of productivity and qualitative characteristics of mnemonic abilities among primary school students with developmental delays. V. D. Shadrikov’s Theory of Abilities, developed in a systemic approach framework, is the theoretical basis of the research. The method of deploying a memorization activity, as elaborated by V. D. Shadrikov and L. V. Cheremoshkina, was the investigation tool used. The sample included students in grades 1 to 4 between ages 7 to 12 and included a total of 100 children (66 boys and 34 girls). The control group of primary school students with typical development included 105 children (50 boys and 55 girls). The research consisted of several stages: a pilot study, experimental research (the test task was to memorize card # 1; the basic task was to memorize cards # 2 and # 3; to <b>reproduce</b> <b>cards</b> # 2 and # 3; and to poll the students), mathematical data processing, and a description of the levels of mnemonic ability development among primary students with developmental delays. The following procedures were employed during statistical analysis: Spearman r 3, Mann-Whitney U-test, Jonckheere-Terpstra test, and Kruskal-Wallis test. The structure of mnemonic abilities in primary schoolchildren with developmental delays was determined to vary according to the underdevelopment of their operational mechanisms. For example, memory functions are based on the use of inborn mechanisms, and a portion of children differ in the type of underdevelopment of their perceptive abilities and attention abilities. Operational and regulative mechanisms of mnemonic abilities in primary schoolchildren with developmental delays are determined to exist at early stages of their formation. Significant differences in productivity and mnemonic abilities in primary school students with developmental delays were observed in comparison with their typically developing peers. In both children with developmental delay, as well as typical children, gender did not present any significant differences in memorization or the employment of functional mechanisms of mnemonic abilities. The analysis shows, and this paper discusses possible causes for subjects’ inability to copy simple nonverbal material after its correct reproduction is shown. ...|$|R
