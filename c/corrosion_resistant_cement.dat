40|$|Corrosion {{resistance}} of sulfated cements in carbonate and in carbonate-sulfate mediums has been studied. The samples {{have been placed}} in carbonate and carbonate-sulfate mediums for investigation stability of sulfated cements. The same researches were done with sulfate <b>resistant</b> portland <b>cement</b> to compare stability of samples. High corrosive <b>resistant</b> of sulfated <b>cements</b> is conditioned by forming dense and strong cement stone. The obtaining of <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>cements</b> is possible with usage of the ordinary portland cement clinker with inclusion to them sulfoferrite and sulfoalumoferrite clinkers. Sulfated cements have the higher corrosion stability in contrast to ordinary sulfate <b>resistant</b> <b>cement...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} slag as single or {{compound}} admixture on the sulfate resistance of alite-barium calcium sulphoaluminate cement were studied. The {{results indicated that}} the addition of slag restrained the formation of ettringite and gypsum due to the activation effect of alkali and sulfate in alite-barium calcium sulphoaluminate cement, and the suitable mass fraction of slag was 20 %. The <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistant</b> coefficient of <b>cement</b> added slag and limestone reduced obviously, while the negative influence of limestone was diminished by the presence of the slag. When the blend of slag and fly ash were contained in the cement, the optimum combination was 30 % slag and 20 % fly ash. By comparison, adding slag singly in the cement leads to the best behavior with respect to the sulfate resistance...|$|R

40|$|The <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistant</b> alloy of Inconel 625 is cladded on {{the inner}} surface of the carbon {{pipeline}} steels of X 65. Two sections of the <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistant</b> alloy (X 65 /Inconel 625) were welded by {{tungsten inert gas welding}} (TIG) with adding material of ERCrNiMo- 3. The electrochemical behavior of the weld metal, heat affected zone (HAZ) and base metal of clad pipe alloys (X 65 /Inconel 625) was investigated at ambient temperature in 3. 5 % NaCl solution using potentiodynamic polarization. To reveal the corrosion resistance of different regions in the <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistant</b> alloys welded joints, some significant characterization parameters such as Ecorr, Eb, Icorr and ΔE in polarisation curves were analyzed and compared. The surface morphology of corrosion products was also analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS).
