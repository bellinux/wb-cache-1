In addition, they contain SPH- 1, the Xenopus homologue of p 80 -coilin, a protein characteristic of <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies.</b> To determine whether coilin is an essential structural component of the <b>coiled</b> <b>body,</b> we removed it from the egg extract by immunoprecipitation. We showed that nuclei with bodies morphologically identical to <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> (at the light microscope level) formed in such coilin-depleted extract. As expected, these bodies did not stain with antibodies against coilin. Moreover, they failed to stain with an antibody against the Sm proteins, although Sm proteins associated with snRNAs were still present in the extract.

Similar results were observed when Sm proteins were depleted from egg extract: staining of the <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> with antibodies against the Sm proteins and coilin was markedly reduced but bright nucleolin and fibrillarin staining remained. These immunodepletion experiments demonstrate an interdependence between coilin and Sm snRNPs and suggest that neither is essential for assembly of nucleolar components in <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies.</b> We propose that <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> are structurally heterogeneous organelles in which {{the components of the}} three RNA processing pathways may occur in separate compartments...|$|R

50|$|For {{segmented}} stator coils, {{a distinction}} is made between T-segments and plugged engine coils. The latter may be bodiless or winded onto a <b>coil</b> <b>body</b> and subsequently {{be transferred to}} a T-segment or directly to the stator laminations, depending on the application. Contingent on the expected contact points, there are three different options {{for the production of}} T-segments.For one, there is the classic single T-segment with the disadvantage of having a high number of contact points. In addition, there is the phase winded T-segment with a reduced number of contact points.

40|$|<b>Coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> are conserved {{subnuclear}} domains {{found in}} both {{plant and animal}} cells. They contain a subset of splicing snRNPs and several nucleolar antigens, including Nopp 140 and fibrillarin. In addition, autoimmune patient sera have identified a <b>coiled</b> <b>body</b> specific protein, called p 80 coilin. In this study we show that p 80 coilin is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. The full-length human p 80 coilin protein correctly localizes in <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> when exogenously expressed in HeLa cells using a transient transfection assay. Mutational analysis identifies separate domains in the p 80 coilin protein that differentially affect its subnuclear localization. The data show that p 80 coilin has a nuclear localization signal, {{but this is not}} sufficient to target the protein to <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies.</b> The results indicate that localization in <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> is not determined by a simple motif analogous to the NLS motifs involved in nuclear import. A specific carboxy-terminal deletion in p 80 coilin results in the formation of pseudo-coiled bodies that are unable to recruit splicing snRNPs. This causes a loss of endogenous <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies.</b> A separate class of mutant coilin proteins are shown to localize in fibrillar structures that surround nucleoli. These mutants also lead to loss of endogenous <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies,</b> produce a dramatic disruption of nucleolar architecture and cause a specific segregation of nucleolar antigens. The structural change in nucleoli is accompanied by the loss of RNA polymerase I activity.

40|$|The <b>coiled</b> <b>body</b> is a {{specific}} intranuclear structure of unknown function that is enriched in splicing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Because adenoviruses {{make use of the}} host cell-splicing machinery and subvert the normal subnuclear organization, we initially decided to investigate the effect of adenovirus infection on the <b>coiled</b> <b>body.</b> The results indicate that adenovirus infection induces the disassembly of <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> and that this effect is probably secondary to the block of host protein synthesis induced by the virus. Furthermore, <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> are shown to be very labile structures, with a half-life of approximately 2 h after treatment of HeLa cells with protein synthesis inhibitors. After blocking of protein synthesis, p 80 coilin was detected in numerous microfoci that do not concentrate snRNP.

40|$|A {{significant}} percentage of the gene clusters that contain the human genes for U 1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) or for U 2 snRNA have been found associated with small nuclear domains, known as <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies.</b> We show here, by immunofluorescent labeling of human cells, that <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> are enriched in factors required for the transcription of these snRNA genes. The 45 -kDa �-subunit of the transcription factor, proximal element sequence-binding transcription factor (PTF), which is specific for the snRNA genes, was found in high concentrations in <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies,</b> along with the general transcription factor TATA-box binding protein and a subset of RNA polymerase II.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization showed that these domains can overlap with U 2 snRNA genes adjacent to <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies.</b> In addition, we found the domains to contain newly synthesized RNA, visualized by 5 -bromo-uridine triphosphate labeling. Our data suggest that <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> {{are involved in the}} expression of snRNA genes, which leads us to propose the model that <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> are associated with snRNA genes to facilitate and regulate their transcription.

50|$|These {{unpredictable}} circumstances may {{be prevented}} or counteracted {{at the beginning}} of the winding by forcing the wire, meaning, every single winding of the first layer on the inner coil diameter, into a predefined position. The wire places itself into a prefabricated groove geometry of the <b>coil</b> <b>body</b> and the wire guide does not need to follow it exactly but only approximately. Since the wire always loses in cross-sectional area due to the wire drawing to be used and the necessary deflections (mechanical stresses under tensile load) during winding, the distance between the grooves is designed only for the max. possible wire diameter. Effects of bends and tolerances of the wire and the <b>coil</b> <b>body</b> as well as changing surface qualities can be avoided that way. Especially wire bends that develop due to wire deflections caused by, e.g., pulleys, wire eyelets or even the wire guiding nozzle itself within the wire feeder of a winding machine can lead to deformations that remain on the winding of a coil. Applying grooves to the winding basis supports the layer-accurate position of the wire during the winding process. This behavior isparticularly beneficial for the winding processes where a plastic deformation of the wire is unavoidable immediately before the depositing of the wire onto the winding basis. This behavior can be observed especially in the needle winding technology. Due to physical reasons, it is unavoidable that the wire leaves the wire guiding nozzle at an angle of approx. 90°. Therefore, mechanical tensions remain inside the wire that are visible in the form of a bent winding on the winding basis. As a result, the following windings or also the following layers can change in their desired position.|$|E
50|$|Electric motors must be {{compact and}} lightweight. They should also deliver a higher output with less copper usage. A {{prerequisite}} {{for this is}} an appropriate design of the <b>coil</b> <b>body</b> and suitable wire dimensions. One parameter of importance for the developer of motors is the electrical fill factor. The fill factor measures the ratio between the volume of a winding package and the volume needed to house the winding package. In case of stators, {{it can be said}} that the electrical fill factor is the ratio of the content of non-ferrous metals of the stator including the stator slot to the sum of the uninsulated copper cross sections. But in contrast to round coils, only the stator slot is considered. The reason for this is that merely the conductor strands in the stator slot contribute to the torque of the motor. The winding overhangs on the narrow sides of the winding cross section of a tooth only result in unwanted losses in the form of increasing electric resistance and undesired heat development.|$|E
5000|$|With {{this type}} of winding {{structure}} only poor fill factors can be achieved. The random wire placement leads to a wider distribution of resulting wire length on the <b>coil</b> <b>body</b> and consequently {{a wider range of}} electric coil resistances. Wild windings can be created in a homogenous way by using a wire feeding rate of 1.5 to 3 times of the wire diameter. Another purpose of this setting is that prevent a sliding of the winding into lower winding areas, which due to the larger voltage differences can lead to electric shortage. Despite many disadvantages this winding it {{can be seen as the}} most common and economic in mass production.

We show that the number of <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies,</b> nuclear organelles in which splicing snRNPs and snRNAs concentrate, is developmentally regulated in the Arabidopsis root epidermis. Firstly, there is a progression from a small number of <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> in the quiescent centre and initial cells, to a larger number in the cell division zone, returning to a lower number in the cell elongation and differentiation zone. Secondly, trichoblasts (root-hair forming epidermal cells) have on average 1. 5 times more and often smaller <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> than atrichoblasts (hairless epidermal cells). Moreover, we have shown that these differences in <b>coiled</b> <b>body</b> numbers are related to differences in cell cycle stage, cell type and developmental stage, but are not due to differences in nucleolar or general metabolic activity per se.

50|$|This type of winding {{structure}} {{creates an}} optimal fill factor (90.7%) for round wires. In {{order to do}} so, the windings of the upper layer need to be placed into the grooves, provided by the lower layer. If the circles are superposed, it can be seen, that the most compact design {{can be achieved by}} using an arrangement with a 60 degree angle. The ratio of provided space to the part of the circle can be determined mathematically.The best spatial use can be achieved if the winding is parallel to the coil flange for most of its circumference, in order to fulfill the stated requirement. When the winding has been placed around the <b>coil</b> <b>body</b> it will meet with the previous positioned wire and needs to make a step with the size of the wire gauge. This movement is called winding step. The winding step can occupy an area of up to 60 degree of the coil circumference for round coil bobbins and takes one side of rectangular coil bobbins. The area of the winding step is dependent on the wire gauge and coil bobbin geometry. If the winding step cannot be executed properly then the self-guiding ability of the wire is lost and a wild winding is produced. Overall, the first intruding wire mainly determines the location and quality of the winding step. It should be recognized that the wire needs to enter in a possibly flat angle into the winding space. That way an unnecessary bending of the wire is being avoided and the needs space for the second winding step is minimized. For orthocyclic wound coils, the winding step areas is always located at the area of wire entering the winding space and is being continued in helical form against the winding direction. As a consequence a bigger winding width of the coil, leads to a bigger winding step area along the circumference of the coil. The created offset leads to a different position of the layer step, from the first to the second layer, in comparison to the wire entry. This behavior repeats itself with every layer which leads to a spiral shaped crossover section {{at the side of the}} winding.Due to the fact that wires are crossing within the crossover section the resulting winding height is increased. As a result, orthocyclic wound coils with a round coil ground are never circular in the cross over section, but the radial moving winding and layer step creates a hump shape. Experience has shown that, depending on the winding width, coil and wire diameter, the crossover section is about 5 to 10 percent higher than the regular winding height.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: <b>Coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> are nuclear organelles {{that are}} highly enriched in small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and certain basal {{transcription}} factors. Surprisingly, <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> not only contain mature U snRNPs but also associate with specific chromosomal loci, including gene clusters that encode U snRNAs and histone messenger RNAs. The mechanism(s) by which <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> associate with these genes is completely unknown. Results: Using stable cell lines, we show that artificial tandem arrays of human U 1 and U 2 snRNA genes colocalize with <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> and that {{the frequency of the}} colocalization depends directly on the transcriptional activity of the array. Association of the genes with <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> was abolished when the artificial U 2 arrays contained promoter mutations that prevent transcription or when RNA polymerase II transcription was globally inhibited by α-amanitin.

40|$|In the {{interphase}} nucleus of mammalian cells the U 1, U 2, U 4 /U 6, and U 5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are subunits of spliceosomes, associate with specific subnuclear domains including interchromatin granules and <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies.</b> Here, we analyze {{the association of}} splicing snRNPs with these structures during mitosis and reassembly of daughter nuclei. At the onset of mitosis snRNPs are predominantly diffuse in the cytoplasm, although a subset remain associated with remnants of <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> and clusters of mitotic interchromatin granules, respectively. The number and size of mitotic <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> remain approximately unchanged from metaphase to early telophase while snRNP-containing clusters of mitotic interchromatin granules increase in size and number as cells progress from anaphase to telophase. During telophase snRNPs are transported into daughter nuclei while the clusters of mitotic interchromatin granules remain in the cytoplasm. The timing of nuclear import of splicing snRNPs closely correlates {{with the onset of}} transcriptional activity in daughter nuclei.

To produce electrical engines cost efficiently, in first-class quality and in sufficient quantity, it is indispensable to understand the process of winding. The prediction of the wire behaviour {{is one of the}} key challenges of coil winding. It is sophisticated and sometimes impossible to measure relevant process parameters (like the wire pull force after wire guide, the wire stress after deformation) in experiments in order to be able to investigate the process in detail. Therefore, a detailed model is built to simulate the wire behaviour during linear winding process. The finite element based simulation tool ANSYS Workbench ® serves as the static structural component tool. ANSYS provides comprehensive possibilities in structural mechanics and it is possible to simulate thermal and electrical physics for future work (Co-simulation within one tool). To represent the high dynamic process of winding within this simulation, some first adaptions have to be made.

40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that discrete foci {{are present in}} the nuclei of mammalian cells in which each of the U 1, U 2, U 4 /U 6, and U 5 snRNPs involved in pre-mRNA splicing, and the non-snRNP-splicing factor U 2 AF, are concentrated (Carmo-Fonseca, M., D. Tollervey, R. Pepperkok, S. Barabino, A. Merdes, C. Brunner, P. D. Zamore, M. R. Green, E. Hurt, and A. I. Lamond. 1991. EMBO (Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.) J. 10 : 195 - 206; Carmo-Fonseca, M., R. Pepperkok, B. S. Sproat, W. Ansorge, M. S. Swanson, and A. I. Lamond. 1991 EMBO (Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.) J. 10 : 1863 - 1873). Here, we identify these snRNP-rich organelles as <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies.</b> snRNPs no longer concentrate in <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> after cells are treated with the transcription inhibitors alpha-amanitin or actinomycin D. snRNP association with <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> is also disrupted by heat shock. This indicates that the association of snRNPs with <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> may be connected with the metabolism of nascent transcripts. A novel labeling method is described which shows both the RNA and protein components of individual snRNPs colocalizing in situ. Using this procedure all spliceosomal snRNPs are seen distributed in a nonhomogeneous pattern throughout the nucleoplasm, excluding nucleoli. They are most concentrated in <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies,</b> but in addition are present in "speckled" structures which are distinct from <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> and which contain the non-snRNP splicing factor SC- 35. U 1 snRNP shows a more widespread nucleoplasmic staining, outside of <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> and "speckled" structures, relative to the other snRNPs. The association of snRNPs with "speckles" is disrupted by heat shock but enhanced when cells are treated with alpha-amanitin...|$|R
40|$|Small nuclear {{ribonucleoprotein}} particles (snRNPs) are subunits of splicing complexes, {{which show}} a transcription-dependent localization pattern. We have analyzed the labelling pattern of snRNPs during pollen development and microspore and pollen embryogenesis in Brassica napus with an antibody which recognizes protein D of U 1, U 2, U 4, U 5, and U 6 snRNPs. It {{was found that}} nuclei were labelled almost uniformly for snRNPs in microspores and young bicellular pollen. In the generative nuclei of late-bicellular pollen and in the vegetative nuclei and sperm nuclei of mature pollen no snRNPs could be detected. The snRNP-positive nuclei contained mostly one or two brightly labelled nuclear <b>bodies,</b> most likely <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies,</b> often {{closely related to the}} nucleolus. These nuclear bodies increased in size from 0. 5 micron in nuclei of young microspores up to 2 microns in nuclei of late microspores and the vegetative nucleus of early-bicellular pollen. Also their number increased during these developmental stages. After induction of embryogenesis the size of the <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> decreased to about 0. 5 micron and in several occasions the <b>coiled</b> <b>body</b> was found free in the nucleoplasm, away from the nucleolus. The results support the idea that the size and number of <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> coincide with changes in general nuclear activity. They also indicate that, in nuclei of Brassica napus, at least assembly and disassembly of <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> takes place in the nucleoplasm, whereas mature <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> are located adjacent to the nucleolus...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In the {{interphase}} nucleus of mammalian cells the U 1, U 2, U 4 /U 6, and U 5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are subunits of spliceosomes, associate with specific subnuclear domains including interchromatin granules and <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies.</b> Here, we analyze {{the association of}} splicing snRNPs with these structures during mitosis and reassembly of daughter nuclei. At the onset of mitosis snRNPs are predominantly diffuse in the cytoplasm, although a subset remain associated with remnants of <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> and clusters of mitotic interchromatin granules, respectively. The number and size of mitotic <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> remain approximately unchanged from metaphase to early telophase while snRNP-containing clusters of mitotic interchromatin granules increase i...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Coiled</b> <b>bodies</b> {{are small}} nuclear organelles {{that are highly}} enriched in small nuclear RNAs, and that have long been thought to be {{associated}} with the nucleolus. Here we use mutational analysis, transient transfections, and the yeast two-hybrid system to show that the nucleolar phosphoprotein Nopp 140 functions as a molecular link between the two prominent nuclear organelles. Exogenous Nopp 140 accumulated in the nucleolus rapidly, but only after a lag phase in <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies,</b> suggesting a pathway between the two organelles. The expression of partial Nopp 140 constructs exerted dominant negative effects on the endogenous Nopp 140 by chasing it and other antigens that were common to both organelles out of the nucleolus. The alternating positively and negatively charged repeat domain of Nopp 140 was required for targeting to both organelles. In addition, partial Nopp 140 constructs caused formation of novel structures in the nucleoplasm and, in the case of the conserved carboxy terminus, led to the dispersal of <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies.</b> As a final link, we identified the coiled body–specific protein p 80 coilin in a yeast two-hybrid screen with Nopp 140. The interaction of the two proteins was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation. Taken together, Nopp 140 appeared to shuttle between the nucleolus and the <b>coiled</b> <b>bodies,</b> and to chaperone the transport of other molecules.
