40|$|Despite recent {{advances}} in <b>Computer</b> <b>Telephony</b> (CT) and IP Telephony (IPT) standards at defining flexible architectures to support new technologies, the current CT paradigm does not adequately support the requirements of advanced spoken di a-logue systems. This paper describes an application framework based on CT and IPT standards that defines new architectural components for information access, alerting, and multi-modal input/output integration. This framework permits separation of the application logic from low-level resource management {{in order to facilitate}} the design and development of advanced, multi-modal voice-enabled services. ...|$|R
