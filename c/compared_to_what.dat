5|$|Degenerate {{stars have}} {{contracted}} into a compact mass, {{resulting in a}} rapid rate of rotation. However they have relatively low rates of rotation <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> would be expected by conservation of angular momentum—the tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its rate of spin. A {{large portion of the}} star's angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind. In spite of this, the rate of rotation for a pulsar can be very rapid. The pulsar {{at the heart of the}} Crab nebula, for example, rotates 30 times per second. The rotation rate of the pulsar will gradually slow due to the emission of radiation.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Reagan {{commuted}} the 18-year {{sentence of}} former Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Gil Dozier, a Democrat from Baton Rouge, {{to the time}} served for violations of both the Hobbs and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations acts. On September 23, 1980, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana convicted Dozier of extortion and racketeering when he pushed companies doing business with his department to make campaign contributions on his behalf. Reagan determined that the 18-year sentence was excessive <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> other political figures in similar circumstances had been receiving.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} point for the script was the ensemble cast of friends and previous collaborators Jarmusch had conceived characters for, while the tripartite formal structure of the film was inspired by his study of literary forms. Cinematographer Robby Müller and musician John Lurie were among the many contributors who had been involved in earlier Jarmusch projects and returned to work on the film. Mystery Trains US$2.8 million budget (financed by Japanese conglomerate JVC) was considerable <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> the director had enjoyed before, and allowed him the freedom to rehearse many unscripted background scenes. It was the first of Jarmusch's feature films to depart from his trademark black-and-white photography, though the use of color was tightly controlled to conform with the director's intuitive sense of the film's aesthetic.|$|E

25|$|Because the h-index {{was never}} meant to measure future {{publication}} success, recently, a group of researchers has investigated the features that are most predictive of future h-index. It is possible to try the predictions using an online tool. However, later work has shown that since h-index is a cumulative measure, it contains intrinsic auto-correlation that led to significant overestimation of its predictability. Thus, the true predictability of future h-index is much lower <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> has been claimed before.|$|E

Much of the fascination with nanotechnology stems from these quantum and surface phenomena that matter exhibits at the nanoscale.|$|E

25|$|A 2010 {{study found}} that, {{as a result}} of rising {{temperatures}} and decreasing solar radiation during the later years of the 20th century, the rice yield growth rate has decreased in many parts of Asia, <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> would have been observed had the temperature and solar radiation trends not occurred. The yield growth rate had fallen 10–20% at some locations. The study was based on records from 227 farms in Thailand, Vietnam, Nepal, India, China, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The mechanism of this falling yield was not clear, but might involve increased respiration during warm nights, which expends energy without being able to photosynthesize.|$|E

25|$|AMD {{designed}} the CPU with more robust x86 instruction decoding capabilities {{than that of}} K6, to enhance its ability to keep more data in-flight at once. The Athlon's three decoders could potentially decode three x86 instructions to six microinstructions per clock, although this was somewhat unlikely in real-world use. The critical branch predictor unit, essential to keeping the pipeline busy, was enhanced <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> was on board the K6. Deeper pipelining with more stages allowed higher clock speeds to be attained. Whereas the AMD K6-III+ topped out at 570MHz due to its short pipeline, even when built on the 180nm process, the Athlon was capable of clocking much higher.|$|E
25|$|From Italy Fregoli went to Brazil, Spain, and the United States. While {{he was in}} Madrid he was {{watched in}} {{performance}} by Alfred Moul, {{the general manager of}} the Alhambra Theatre in London's Charing Cross Road (which was being refitted at that time in the Moorish style {{under the direction of the}} great designer Owen Jones). Moul had heard of Fregoli's genius and wanted to be the first impresario in Britain to sign him up. He subsequently claimed that Fregoli (and his team of supporting assistants) were being paid £350 per week to perform at the Alhambra—a remarkable amount for the time. This was nothing <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> Fregoli was to generate in ticket sales.|$|E
25|$|Critics of Social Security {{claim that}} it gives a low rate of return, <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> is {{obtained}} through private retirement accounts. For example, critics point out that under the Social Security laws as they existed at that time, several thousand employees of Galveston County, Texas were allowed {{to opt out of}} the Social Security program in the early 1980s, and have their money placed in a private retirement plan instead. While employees who earned $50,000 per year would have collected $1,302 per month in Social Security benefits, the private plan paid them $6,843 per month. While employees who earned $20,000 per year would have collected $775 per month in Social Security benefits, the private plan paid them $2,740 per month, at interest rates prevailing in 1996. While some advocates of privatization of Social Security point to the Galveston pension plan as a model for Social Security reform, critics point to a GAO report to the House Ways and Means Committee, which indicates that, for low and middle income employees, particularly those with shorter work histories, the outcome may be less favorable.|$|E

25|$|It was rumoured that Robertson was {{angling for}} Haig’s job in July, {{although}} there is no clear evidence that this was so. This was the month with the highest British casualties of the entire war, {{at a time when the}} German Verdun Offensive was already being scaled back. Haig was reluctant to send Robertson full weekly reports and Robertson complained that Haig’s daily telegrams to him contained little more information than the daily press releases. “Not exactly the letter of a CIGS! … He ought to take responsibility also!” was Haig’s comment on one such letter (29 July). F.E. Smith (1 August) circulated a paper by his friend Winston Churchill (then out of office), criticising the high losses and negligible gains of the Somme. Churchill argued that this would leave Germany freer to win victories elsewhere. Robertson issued a strong rebuttal the same day, arguing that Britain’s losses were small <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> France had suffered in previous years, that Germany had had to quadruple the number of her divisions on the Somme sector and that this had taken pressure off Verdun and contributed to the success of Russian and Italian offensives. After the Churchill memorandum, both Robertson and Esher wrote to Haig reminding him of how Robertson was covering Haig’s back in London, Robertson reminding Haig of the need to give him “the necessary data with which to reply to the swines” (7 and 8 August).|$|E
25|$|The {{somewhat}} {{thin and}} fragile shell is small <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> is {{known from the}} other achatinids in southern Africa, its length/height is less than 45mm with about 7½ whorls. (This description is in contradiction to Connolly (1925), who probably attributes a wrongly identified shell 63.2mm long to this taxon – a statement not repeated in his 1939 monograph.) The length is always more than two times the maximum diameter, which is situated at {{about the level of}} the apex of the aperture. The length of the aperture is always less than half that of the shell; the length of the last whorl in front view is always under three quarters of the total length. The apex is comparatively blunt. The whorls are hardly convex, including the body whorl. The aperture is fairly narrow (greatest width just under the middle) with a thin outer lip; the columella is white, short and narrow, concave with a slight twist, obliquely truncate close to the base. The nepionic whorls are wrinkled and granulose, though always worn in the material studied. The sculpture consists of regular and close wrinkles resulting in a reticulate-granulate pattern, very prominent below the sutures but well visible on all whorls; in addition there are very faint growth striae. All specimens exhibit a close and fine zebra pattern with irregular, orange-brown flames on a yellowish-brown background; there is a very thin and deciduous periostracum. On the whole this seems to be a well-defined taxon because of the size, shape and sculpture of the shell.|$|E
500|$|From a {{macroeconomic}} perspective, the PPF {{illustrates the}} production possibilities {{available to a}} nation or economy during a given period of time for broad categories of output. It is traditionally used to show the movement between committing all funds to consumption on the y-axis versus investment on the x-axis. [...] However, an economy may achieve productive efficiency without necessarily being allocatively efficient.
