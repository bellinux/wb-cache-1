50|$|At {{the upper}} ends of Denali’s glaciers are steep-walled semicircular basins called <b>cirques.</b> <b>Cirques</b> form from {{freeze-thaw}} cycles of meltwater {{in the rocks}} above the glacier, and by glacial erosion and mass wasting occurring under the glacier. As <b>cirques</b> on the opposite sides of a ridge are cut deeper into the divide, they form a narrow, sharp, serrated ridge called an arête. As the arête wears away from glacial ice breaking it down, the low point between <b>cirques</b> is called a col (or if it is large, a pass). Cols are saddle-shaped depressions in the ridge between <b>cirques.</b> A spire-like sharp peak, called a horn, is formed when <b>cirques</b> cut back into a mountaintop from three or four sides.|$|R
50|$|The Pingdingshan (平顶山) glacial <b>cirques</b> are {{remnants}} of the Quaternary, in the southeast part of Hexigten Banner. The existence of <b>cirques</b> and other Quaternary glacial features in Hexigten are importance evidence of the glacial history ofnorthern China.|$|R

Taking acts from Nouvelle Expérience and <b>Cirque</b> Réinventé, they created a show for this tour, titled Fascination. Although Fascination was never seen outside Japan, it represented the first time that <b>Cirque</b> du Soleil had produced a show that took place in an arena rather than a big top. It was also the first that <b>Cirque</b> du Soleil performed outside of North America.|$|E

It was discovered and plotted from air photos by the Third German Antarctic Expedition, 1938-39. It was replotted from air photos and surveys, and named, by the Sixth Norwegian Antarctic Expedition, 1956-60.

5|$|The <b>cirque</b> where Castle Lake {{is found}} {{is a classic}} Northern Hemisphere <b>cirque.</b> The <b>cirque</b> {{headwall}} (the highest part of the mountain where the glacier began to form) was in the south or southwest, and {{the part of the}} mountain that sloped downward to the northeast was away from the prevailing winds. The resulting shaded area was sheltered from direct sun, and from the evaporating effects of wind. These conditions encouraged snow which had fallen in the winter to remain throughout the summer and fall, creating a year-round snow pack which grew deeper each year.|$|E

On the sides of Katahdin are four glacial <b>cirques</b> carved into the granite by alpine glaciers and in these <b>cirques</b> behind moraines and eskers are several ponds.|$|R
5000|$|The 'cirque infills' {{described}} by Hätterstrand et al. (2008) [...] in the Khibiny Mountains, Kola Peninsula {{could be described}} as discrete debris accumulations, although their origin is postulated by these authors as being moraine remnants of an ice sheet pushing into these <b>cirques</b> rather than as rock glaciers formed within the <b>cirques.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Cirque</b> du Soleil {{expanded}} rapidly {{through the}} 1990s and 2000s, {{going from one}} show to 19 shows in over 271 cities on every continent except Antarctica. The shows employ approximately 4,000 people from over 40 countries and generate an estimated annual revenue exceeding US$810million. The multiple permanent Las Vegas shows alone play to more than 9,000 people a night, 5% of the city's visitors, adding to the 90million people who have experienced <b>Cirque</b> du Soleil's shows worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In May 2013 The Light Group {{opened the}} Light nightclub in {{collaboration}} with <b>Cirque</b> du Soleil at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, costing $25 million. Light {{was the first time}} <b>Cirque</b> du Soleil worked as part of a nightclub. Among other features the club has a large wall of LED screens, and the room is illuminated with fog, lasers and strobes. DJs at the events include charting artists such as Kaskade and Tiesto, with prices ranging from $30 to $10,000 for certain table placements.|$|E

5|$|The {{problems}} were only transient, however, {{and by the}} time 1984 had come to a close, Le Grand Tour du <b>Cirque</b> du Soleil was a success. Having only $60,000 left in the bank, Laliberté went back to the Canadian government to secure funding for a second year. While the Canadian federal government was enthusiastic, the Quebec provincial government was resistant to the idea. It was not until Quebec's premier, René Lévesque, intervened on their behalf that the provincial government relented. The original big top tent that was used during the 1984 Le Grand Tour du <b>Cirque</b> du Soleil tour can now be seen at Carnivàle Lune Bleue, a 1930s-style carnival that is home to the <b>Cirque</b> Maroc acrobats.|$|E
50|$|If two {{adjacent}} <b>cirques</b> erode {{toward one}} another, an arête, or steep sided ridge, forms. When {{three or more}} <b>cirques</b> erode toward one another, a pyramidal peak is created. In some cases, this peak will be made accessible {{by one or more}} arêtes. The Matterhorn in the European Alps is an example of such a peak.|$|R
