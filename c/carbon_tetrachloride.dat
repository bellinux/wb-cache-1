5|$|Protactinium(V) {{chloride}} {{is prepared}} by reacting protactinium oxide with <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> at temperature of 200–300°C. The by-products (such as PaOCl3) are removed by fractional sublimation. Reduction of protactinium(V) chloride with hydrogen at about 800°C yields protactinium(IV) chloride – a yellow-green solid which sublimes in vacuum at 400°C; {{it can also}} be obtained directly from protactinium dioxide by treating it with <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> at 400°C.|$|E
5|$|Elemental iodine is {{slightly}} soluble in water, with one gram dissolving in 3450ml at 20°C and 1280ml at 50°C; potassium iodide may {{be added to}} increase solubility via formation of triiodide ions, among other polyiodides. Nonpolar solvents such as hexane and <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> provide a higher solubility. Polar solutions, such as aqueous solutions, are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as Lewis bases; on the other hand, nonpolar solutions are violet, the color of iodine vapour. Charge-transfer complexes form when iodine is dissolved in polar solvents, hence changing the colour. Iodine is violet when dissolved in <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> and saturated hydrocarbons but deep brown in alcohols and amines, solvents that form charge-transfer adducts.|$|E
5|$|In 1845 German chemist Hermann Kolbe {{synthesised}} {{acetic acid}} from inorganic compounds {{for the first}} time. This reaction sequence consisted of chlorination of carbon disulfide to <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride,</b> followed by pyrolysis to tetrachloroethylene and aqueous chlorination to trichloroacetic acid, and concluded with electrolytic reduction to acetic acid.|$|E
5|$|Actinium trichloride is {{obtained}} by reacting actinium hydroxide or oxalate with <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> vapors at temperatures above 960°C. Similar to oxyfluoride, actinium oxychloride {{can be prepared}} by hydrolyzing actinium trichloride with ammonium hydroxide at 1000°C. However, {{in contrast to the}} oxyfluoride, the oxychloride could well be synthesized by igniting a solution of actinium trichloride in hydrochloric acid with ammonia.|$|E
5|$|Ethanol {{extracts}} of {{the fruit}} body are high in antioxidant activity, and have been shown in laboratory tests to have anti-inflammatory activity comparable to the drug diclofenac. Studies with mouse models have also demonstrated hepatoprotective (liver-protecting) ability, possibly by restoring diminished levels of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase caused by experimental exposure to the liver-damaging chemical <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride.</b>|$|E
5|$|Metallic {{plutonium}} {{is produced}} by reacting plutonium tetrafluoride with barium, calcium or lithium at 1200°C. It is attacked by acids, oxygen, and steam but not by alkalis and dissolves easily in concentrated hydrochloric, hydroiodic and perchloric acids. Molten metal must be kept in a vacuum or an inert atmosphere to avoid reaction with air. At 135°C the metal will ignite in air and will explode if placed in <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pure {{alkali metals}} are dangerously {{reactive}} with {{air and water}} and must be kept away from heat, fire, oxidising agents, acids, most organic compounds, halocarbons, plastics, and moisture. They also react with carbon dioxide and <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride,</b> so that normal fire extinguishers are counterproductive when used on alkali metal fires. Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are effective, depriving the fire of oxygen and cooling the alkali metal.|$|E
5|$|Pontecorvo's 1945 paper {{credits the}} idea using <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> (CCl4) to the French {{physicist}} Jules Guéron. Experiments were conducted at Chalk River using the NRX as a neutrino source, but were unsuccessful, and were abandoned in 1949, after Pontecorvo had left. The experiment was unsuccessful because, unknown at the time, nuclear reactors produced antineutrinos instead of neutrinos. In {{what is now}} known as the Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment, Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan detected antineutrinos in 1955, for which they won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Many {{organochlorine}} compounds {{have been}} isolated from natural sources ranging from bacteria to humans. Chlorinated organic compounds {{are found in}} nearly every class of biomolecules including alkaloids, terpenes, amino acids, flavonoids, steroids, and fatty acids. Organochlorides, including dioxins, are produced in the high temperature environment of forest fires, and dioxins {{have been found in}} the preserved ashes of lightning-ignited fires that predate synthetic dioxins. In addition, a variety of simple chlorinated hydrocarbons including dichloromethane, chloroform, and <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> have been isolated from marine algae. A majority of the chloromethane in the environment is produced naturally by biological decomposition, forest fires, and volcanoes.|$|E
5|$|Two {{neptunium}} chlorides, NpCl3 and NpCl4, {{have been}} characterized. Although several attempts to create NpCl5 have been made, {{they have not}} been successful. NpCl3 is created by reducing neptunium dioxide with hydrogen and <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> (CCl4) and NpCl4 by reacting a neptunium oxide with CCl4 at around 500°C. Other neptunium chloride compounds have also been reported, including NpOCl2, Cs2NpCl6, Cs3NpO2Cl4, and Cs2NaNpCl6. Neptunium bromides NpBr3 and NpBr4 have also been created; the latter by reacting aluminium bromide with NpO2 at 350°C and the former in an almost identical procedure but with zinc present. The neptunium iodide NpI3 has also been prepared by the same method as NpBr3.|$|E
5|$|The pale-brown bromine monofluoride (BrF) is {{unstable}} at room temperature, disproportionating {{quickly and}} irreversibly into bromine, bromine trifluoride, and bromine pentafluoride. It thus cannot be obtained pure. It may be synthesised by the direct {{reaction of the}} elements, or by the comproportionation of bromine and bromine trifluoride at high temperatures. Bromine monochloride (BrCl), a red-brown gas, quite readily dissociates reversibly into bromine and chlorine at room temperature and thus also cannot be obtained pure, though {{it can be made}} by the reversible direct reaction of its elements in the gas phase or in <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride.</b> Bromine monofluoride in ethanol readily leads to the monobromination of the aromatic compounds PhX (para-bromination occurs for X = Me, But, OMe, Br; meta-bromination occurs for the deactivating X = –CO2Et, –CHO, –NO2); this is due to heterolytic fission of the Br–F bond, leading to rapid electrophilic bromination by Br+.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen, {{like some}} of the alkali metals, reacts explosively with fluorine. Carbon, as lamp black, reacts at room {{temperature}} to yield fluoromethane. Graphite combines with fluorine above 400°C (750°F) to produce non-stoichiometric carbon monofluoride; higher temperatures generate gaseous fluorocarbons, sometimes with explosions. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide react at or just above room temperature, whereas paraffins and other organic chemicals generate strong reactions: even fully substituted haloalkanes such as <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride,</b> normally incombustible, may explode. Although nitrogen trifluoride is stable, nitrogen requires an electric discharge at elevated temperatures for reaction with fluorine to occur, due to the very strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen; ammonia may react explosively. Oxygen does not combine with fluorine under ambient conditions, but can be made to react using electric discharge at low temperatures and pressures; the products tend to disintegrate into their constituent elements when heated. Heavier halogens react readily with fluorine as does the noble gas radon; of the other noble gases, only xenon and krypton react, and only under special conditions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} potent hepatotoxins (toxic to the liver), so much so that it is widely used in {{scientific}} research to evaluate hepatoprotective agents. Exposure to high concentrations of <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> (including vapor) can affect the central nervous system, degenerate the liver and kidneys, and prolonged exposure may lead to coma or death. Chronic exposure to <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> can cause liver and kidney damage and could result in cancer. See safety data sheets.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} {{volatile}} substances, <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> {{is prone to}} misuse by inhalation, due to its possible depressant and/or dissociative effect upon the central nervous system. Use of <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> in this manner presents serious health risks, and may result in toxic effects described above.|$|E
25|$|Examples include arsenic, <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride,</b> and vinyl chloride.|$|E
25|$|Another type of <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> {{extinguisher}} was {{the fire}} grenade. This {{consisted of a}} glass sphere filled with CTC, that {{was intended to be}} hurled {{at the base of a}} fire (early ones used salt-water, but CTC was more effective). <b>Carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> was suitable for liquid and electrical fires and the extinguishers were fitted to motor vehicles. <b>Carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> extinguishers were withdrawn in the 1950s because of the chemical's toxicity – exposure to high concentrations damages the nervous system and internal organs. Additionally, when used on a fire, the heat can convert CTC to phosgene gas, formerly used as a chemical weapon.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, a new insect {{infestation}} {{was discovered in}} the back of the panel as a result of crosspieces installed to keep the painting from warping. This was treated on the spot with <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride,</b> and later with an ethylene oxide treatment. In 1985, the spot was again treated with <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> as a preventive measure.|$|E
25|$|In organic chemistry, <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> {{serves as}} a source of {{chlorine}} in the Appel reaction.|$|E
25|$|Intel {{has been}} accused by some {{residents}} of Rio Rancho, New Mexico of allowing VOCs {{to be released in}} excess of their pollution permit. One resident claimed that a release of 1.4 tons of <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> was measured from one acid scrubber during the fourth quarter of 2003 but an emission factor allowed Intel to report no <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> emissions for all of 2003.|$|E

25|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> {{was widely}} {{used as a}} dry {{cleaning}} solvent, as a refrigerant, and in lava lamps.|$|E
25|$|Carboxylation of adamantane {{was first}} {{reported}} in 1960, using formic acid as a carboxylating agent and <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> as a solvent.|$|E
25|$|The {{output of}} these {{processes}} {{is a mixture of}} chloromethane, dichloromethane, chloroform, and <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride.</b> These compounds are separated by distillation.|$|E
25|$|It {{once was}} a popular solvent in organic chemistry, but, because of its adverse health effects, it is rarely used today. It is {{sometimes}} useful as a solvent for infrared spectroscopy, {{because there are no}} significant absorption bands > 1600cm−1. Because <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> does not have any hydrogen atoms, it was historically used in proton NMR spectroscopy. In addition to being toxic, its dissolving power is low. Its use has been largely superseded by deuterated solvents. Use of <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> in determination of oil has been replaced by various other solvents, such as tetrachloroethylene. Because it has no C-H bonds, <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> does not easily undergo free-radical reactions. It is a useful solvent for halogenations either by the elemental halogen or by a halogenation reagent such as N-bromosuccinimide (these conditions are known as Wohl-Ziegler Bromination).|$|E
25|$|It {{was first}} {{reported}} by Grimm and Metzger, who prepared it by treating hydrogen selenide with <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> {{in a hot}} tube.|$|E

25|$|Other dichloro {{derivatives}} of {{ethylene oxide}} {{can be obtained}} by combined action of sulfuryl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine and of triphenylphosphine and <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{output of}} this process is a mixture of the four chloromethanes (chloromethane, dichloromethane, chloroform, and <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride),</b> which can then be {{separated}} by distillation.|$|E

25|$|In the <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> molecule, four {{chlorine}} atoms {{are positioned}} symmetrically as corners in a tetrahedral configuration joined {{to a central}} carbon atom by single covalent bonds. Because of this symmetrical geometry, CCl4 is non-polar. Methane gas has the same structure, making <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> a halomethane. As a solvent, it is well suited to dissolving other non-polar compounds, fats, and oils. It can also dissolve iodine. It is somewhat volatile, giving off vapors with a smell characteristic of other chlorinated solvents, somewhat similar to the tetrachloroethylene smell reminiscent of dry cleaners' shops.|$|E
25|$|Exposure {{to other}} hepatotoxins can occur accidentally or {{intentionally}} through ingestion, inhalation, and skin absorption. The industrial toxin <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> {{and the wild}} mushroom Amanita phalloides are other known hepatotoxins.|$|E
25|$|The <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> must be {{maintained}} anhydrous throughout the reaction, {{as the presence of}} water may likely hydrolyze the desired product. Barium carbonate is often added to maintain anhydrous and acid-free conditions.|$|E
25|$|The Belgian {{scientist}} Frédéric Swarts {{pioneered the}} synthesis of CFCs in the 1890s. He developed an effective exchange agent to replace chloride in <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> with fluoride to synthesize CFC-11 (CCl3F) and CFC-12 (CCl2F2).|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> {{on human health}} and the {{environment}} have been assessed under REACH in 2012 in the context of the substance evaluation by France. Thereafter, further information has been requested from the registrants. Later this decision was reversed.|$|E
25|$|One {{specialty}} use of <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> is in stamp collecting, {{to reveal}} watermarks on postage stamps without damaging them. A {{small amount of}} the liquid {{was placed on the}} back of a stamp, sitting in a black glass or obsidian tray. The letters or design of the watermark could then be clearly seen.|$|E
