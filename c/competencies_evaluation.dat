Aim: The aim was to assess the level of self-perceived competency in dental public health among postgraduate (PG) students in India. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was done among the PG students in the specialty of public health dentistry in India. Their competency was assessed by a questionnaire sent through E-mail. Students assessed their competence in these dental public health functions using a 3 point ordinal scale, 0 indicating "not at all competent," 1 as "competent," and 2 as "very competent. " Chi-square has been used for categorical variables. Results: One-hundred and twenty-four PG students responded to the questionnaire. Comparison was made for gender and academic year. Males were significantly competent to comply infection control policies and procedures (P < 0. 040 FNx 01). Third year PG students were significantly competent to comply infection control policies and procedures (P < 0. 017) and to adapt their dental practice to the existing laws and regulations (P < 0. 45).

Several key-problems of the work market were identified on national level, among them: the need {{for the development of a}}n educated and qualified human capital, able to have high performances and the need for the development of a life-long learning culture. The study aims at: improving the quality and the rising of the cooperation level among the institutions providing education and training, enterprises, social partners and other local and national organizations. The activities carried on in order to sustain/achieve the proposed goals aim at: the development of an instruments set for the <b>competencies</b> <b>evaluation</b> (instruments adapted to the characteristics of the target group and integrated in a guidebook addressed to the counselor as well as the client); the development of the clear and developmental procedure for the counseling of the temporary workers in order to validate the competencies; the identification of the certification conditions and of the accredited bodies. The long-term results to: strengthening of the employers-employees relationships, the rise of the professional insertion level of the temporary workers. On the short term, we take into account: the awareness of the personal interests and values, the diagnosis of the aptitudes and competencies, the identification of resources and barriers for the career development, configuration of a realistic career plan.

40|$|IT {{consulting}} {{companies must}} be able to select the best suited developers for their clients. A method of doing this is through competence evaluation. Sigma IT Consulting uses an excel sheet for employees to fill in their competence. Problems such as data inconsistencies in competency excel worksheets might cause difficulties for managers while making decisions to assign right developer to the right job. Such difficulties may lead to frustration in managers and negatively affect their decisionmaking process. Similarly, developers might feel themselves under pressure always having to fill in the competency sheet whenever the manager emails the sheet to them among all the tasks developer is busy with and feeling under pressure might have negative effects on developers’ performance. Researchers have shown that negative emotions lead to poor software development performance, while positive emotions improve developers’ performance. <b>Competency</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{is an integral part of}} the daily routine at Sigma IT Consulting. Therefore, negative effects of competency sheets on developers and managers cannot be tolerated. In this case study, having investigated how competency is evaluated at Sigma IT and what employees think about <b>competency</b> <b>evaluation</b> in general, we implemented a web-based <b>competency</b> <b>evaluation</b> platform.
