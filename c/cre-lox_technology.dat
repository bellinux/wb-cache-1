40|$|Muscle {{spindles}} (MS) and Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) are encapsulated, stretch-activated sensory receptors housed within skeletal muscles, {{yet their}} functional contributions to proprioceptive monitoring of limb movements are quite different. For example, MS {{are responsible for}} detecting stretch of muscle fibers, and GTOs provide feedback regarding muscle tension during contraction. Peripheral axons extending from proprioceptive sensory neurons (PSNs) in the dorsal root ganglia supply MS and GTOs. MS are innervated by Group Ia and II sensory fiber endings, while GTOs are innervated by a single Group Ib sensory fiber. The developmental processes guiding axons from PSNs to their targets and the maturation of distinct functional identities in skeletal muscle, however, remain largely unknown. To study PSNs and their peripheral endings more closely, we took advantage of existing transgenic mouse models using <b>Cre-lox</b> recombination <b>technology</b> in which all proprioceptive afferents are labeled with a red fluorescent protein, tdTomato (Parvalbumin-Cre/+; Rosa-CAG-LSL-tdTomato-WPRE). Using this model, we present results from a quantitative confocal microscopy analysis of proprioceptive receptors and their associated afferent axons taken from whole-mount neonatal mouse soleus muscle preparations. We focused a portion of our analysis on the unique extramuscular bifurcation of the soleus nerve, which gives rise to stereotypic thin and thick nerve branches. Our {{results show that the}} proprioceptor-enriched thin branch of the soleus nerve always contains Ib afferents and usually a mix of Ia and II spindle afferents, but occasionally lacks MS afferents altogether or contains MS afferents of only one type. Heterogeneity in the thin branch may provide a useful tool in analysis of MS and GTO maturation during embryonic and early postnatal development. Additionally, we optimized a technique for retrieving single fluorescently labeled neurons from wild-type and PV-Cre/+; Rosa-tdT/+ dorsal root ganglia and utilized qRT-PCR to screen those neurons for expression of established and putative markers of PSNs...|$|R
40|$|In liver, peroxisomes have an {{important}} role in lipid metabolism. These organelles metabolize a specific subset of fatty acids, such as very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA), branched chain fatty acids (BCFA) and dicarboxylic acids and peroxisomes participate in the conversion of cholesterol into mature conjugated C 24 bile acids. Despite their limited metabolic role, liver function is severely hampered when peroxisomes are absent. Zellweger patients develop hepatomegaly, hepatosteatosis that often develops to fibrosis and cirrhosis and striking mitochondrial abnormalities in hepatocytes. In recent years, a mouse model with liver-specific elimination of peroxisomes was generated through knockout of the Pex 5 import protein using the conditional <b>Cre-lox</b> knockout <b>technology</b> (L-Pex 5 -/- mice). Similar to Zellweger patients, L-Pex 5 -/- mice develop hepatomegaly and hepatosteatosis, defective mitochondrial ultrastructure and function, increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and PPAR&# 945; activation. To compensate for mitochondrial dysfunction, mitochondria proliferate and glycolytic enzyme activity increases. We now performed an in depth study of the alterations in mitochondrial, carbohydrate and lipid metabolic pathways and their causal mechanisms in the peroxisome deficient liver. Activity of respiratory complex I, III and V was strongly impaired in L-Pex 5 -/- livers. This was caused by reduced expression of mtDNA encoded subunits and was reflected by reduced mtDNA copy number. To search for the primary cause of these alterations, accumulation of peroxisomal substrates was studied. VLCFA, BCFA and C 27 bile acids accumulated, but a primary role for any of these metabolites was excluded by comparison with MFP 2 -/- mice, a model with defective peroxisomal ß-oxidation. These mice show similar disturbances in lipid homeostasis but no mitochondrial defects. A possible role for dicarboxylic acids, which also accumulated, remains open. Finally, overexpression of PGC- 1 &# 945; was not able to restore deficient complex I function and hence reduced PGC- 1 &# 945; expression does not cause mitochondrial dysfunction in L-Pex 5 -/- livers. Due to deficient mitochondrial ATP production, the cellular energy sensor AMPK was activated in L-Pex 5 -/- livers. To restore cellular energy balance, AMPK increased glycolytic rate via unidentified posttranscriptional mechanisms and reduced gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis by affecting transcription of the rate limiting enzymes. Moreover, AMPK inhibited de novo lipogenesis via phosphorylation of ACC and via suppression of SREBP 1 c and FASN expression. Reduced synthesis of the Cpt 1 a inhibitor malonyl-CoA by ACC and increased expression of mitochondrial ß-oxidation enzymes contributed to increased capacity for fatty acid oxidation. Increased carbohydrate and fatty acid oxidation produced high amounts of NADH, which were less efficiently reoxidized to NAD+ due to defective OXPHOS. The resulting reduced activation of SIRT 1, together with reduced SIRT 1 protein levels and increased GCN 5 mRNA levels led to increased acetylation levels of PGC- 1 &# 945;. Thus, in line with low rates of glucose production, both expression and activity of PGC- 1 &# 945; were found to be decreased. Via an autoregulatory loop, inactive PGC- 1 &# 945; may suppress its own mRNA and protein expression levels. Hepatic lipids accumulated via strongly increased fatty acid uptake through enhanced levels of the CD 36 transporter and reduced VLDL secretion, but despite high capacity for fatty acid oxidation and low rates of lipid synthesis. Hepatic insulin signaling was impaired in peroxisome deficient hepatocytes, which probably occurred secondary to lipid accumulation. The lipid sensor PPAR&# 945; was strongly activated in peroxisome deficient hepatocytes, as was reflected by increased expression levels of its target genes. This suggests that an endogenous PPAR&# 945; ligand accumulates when peroxisomes are absent, but its exact identity remains to be determined. In conclusion, hepatic peroxisome dysfunction affects mitochondrial structure and function, disrupts cellular energy homeostasis and severely deregulates both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. status: publishe...|$|R

To study the role of SIRT 6 in SMCs, we created a novel strain of SMC-specific SIRT 6 -deficient (SIRT 6 KO) mice with <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>technology.</b> Because no defects were observed in the aortas of SIRT 6 KO mice, they were then infused with angiotensin II (Ang II) to induce oxidative stress. Compared with vehicle controls, SIRT 6 KO mice developed aortitis, aortic hemorrhage, and aneurysms in response to Ang II.

40|$|SummaryLeptin plays {{a pivotal}} role in {{regulation}} of energy balance. Via unknown central pathways, leptin also affects peripheral glucose homeostasis and locomotor activity. We hypothesized that, specifically, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons mediate those actions. To examine this possibility, we applied <b>Cre-Lox</b> <b>technology</b> to express leptin receptors (ObRb) exclusively in POMC neurons of the morbidly obese, profoundly diabetic, and severely hypoactive leptin receptor-deficient Leprdb/db mice. Here, we show that expression of ObRb only in POMC neurons leads to a marked decrease in energy intake and a modest reduction in body weight in Leprdb/db mice. Remarkably, blood glucose levels are entirely normalized. This normalization occurs independently of changes in food intake and body weight. In addition, physical activity is greatly increased despite profound obesity.

To understand the tissue-specific role of SCD 1 in energy homeostasis, we used <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>technology</b> to generate mice with a liver-specific knockout of Scd 1 (LKO). LKO mice were protected from high-carbohydrate, but not high-fat (HF), diet-induced adiposity and hepatic steatosis. Additionally, on a high-sucrose, very low-fat (HSVLF) diet, lipogenesis and levels of nuclear SREBP- 1 and ChREBP were significantly decreased in the livers of LKO relative to Scd 1 lox/lox (Lox) mice. HSVLF feeding in LKO mice caused hypoglycemia and hepatic carbohydrate reduction due to an impairment of gluconeogenesis. Oleate, but not stearate, supplementation normalized adiposity, gluconeogenesis, triglyceride secretion, and hepatic lipogenesis of LKO mice. These results indicate that hepatic SCD 1 expression (and thus, oleate) is required for carbohydrate-induced adiposity, but SCD 1 inhibition in extrahepatic tissues is required to protect mice from HF-induced obesity and insulin resistance...|$|E

To test the hypothesis that receptor signaling in different cell types is responsible for these aspects of AHR biology, we generated a conditional Ahr allele where exon 2 is flanked by loxP sites. Through the use of <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>technology,</b> we then investigated the role of AHR signaling in hepatocytes or endothelial cells in mediating prototypical endpoints of adaptive, toxic, or developmental signaling.

In mouse models, the roles for RA signals in telencephalic development remain unclear, {{partly because of}} the ambiguity of RA telencephalic sources after E 8. 75. Here, we have developed a genetic approach that utilizes <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>technology</b> to conditionally express a potent dominant negative retinoid receptor, RAR 403, in vivo. This approach blocks RA signaling pathways at the receptor level, enabling the disruption of RA signals in contexts in which the RA source is unknown. RAR 403 expression throughout the developing telencephalon causes pronounced hypoplasia resulting from defective proliferation in dorsal telencephalic progenitors and extensive cell death. Furthermore, Nkx 2. 1 + progenitors in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) are misspecified such that they acquire a subset of lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) -specific properties at the expense of MGE fates.

40|$|Dysregulated Wnt {{signaling}} is seen {{in approximately}} 30 % of hepatocellular carcinomas; thus, finding pathways downstream of the activation of Wnt signaling is key. Here, using <b>cre-lox</b> <b>technology,</b> we deleted the Apc gene in the adult mouse liver and observed a rapid increase in nuclear beta-catenin and c-Myc, which is associated with an induction of proliferation that led to hepatomegaly within 4 days of gene deletion. To investigate the downstream pathways responsible for these phenotypes, we analyzed the impact of inactivating APC {{in the context of}} deficiency of the potentially key effectors beta-catenin and c-Myc. beta-catenin loss rescues both the proliferation and hepatomegaly phenotypes after APC loss. However, c-Myc deletion, which rescues the phenotypes of APC loss in the intestine, had no effect on the phenotypes of APC loss in the liver. The consequences of the deregulation of the Wnt pathway within the liver are therefore strikingly different from those observed within the intestine, with the vast majority of Wnt targets being beta-catenin-dependent but c-Myc-independent in the live...|$|E
40|$|The {{ureteric}} bud (UB) expresses {{high levels}} of the EGF receptor (EGFR) during kidney development, but its function in this setting is unclear. Here, Egfr mRNA was abundant in medullary portions of the UB trunk but absent from the branching UB tips during embryogenesis. Homozygous Egfr knockout {{did not affect the}} pattern of UB arborization, but renal papillae were hypoplastic and exhibited widespread apoptosis of tubular cells. Because these EGFR-deficient mice die within 1 week of life, we targeted Egfr inactivation to the renal collecting ducts using <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>technology</b> with a Hoxb 7 -Cre transgene. This targeted inactivation of Egfr led to a thin renal medulla, and at 7 weeks of age, the mice had moderate polyuria and reduced urine-concentrating ability. At 30 to 33 weeks, water deprivation demonstrated a continued urine-concentrating defect despite similar levels of vasopressin between knockout mice and littermate controls. Taken together, these results suggest that unlike other tyrosine kinases expressed at the UB tip, EGFR functions primarily to drive elongation of the emerging collecting ducts and to optimize urine-concentrating ability...|$|E
40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) plays a {{critical}} role in normal development as well as retinal vasculature disease. During retinal vascularization, VEGF is most strongly expressed by not yet vascularized retinal astrocytes, but also by retinal astrocytes within the developing vascular plexus, suggesting a role for retinal astrocyte-derived VEGF in angiogenesis and vessel network maturation. To test the role of astrocyte-derived VEGF, we used <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>technology</b> in mice to delete VEGF in retinal astrocytes during development. Surprisingly, this only had a minor impact on retinal vasculature development, with only small decreases in plexus spreading, endothelial cell proliferation and survival observed. In contrast, astrocyte VEGF deletion had more pronounced effects on hyperoxia-induced vaso-obliteration and led to the regression of smooth muscle cell-coated radial arteries and veins, which are usually resistant to the vessel-collapsing effects of hyperoxia. These results suggest that VEGF production from retinal astrocytes is relatively dispensable during development, but performs vessel stabilizing functions in the retinal vasculature and might be relevant for retinopathy of prematurity in humans...|$|E

These pregnancy-induced mammary epithelial cells (PI-MECs) originate from differentiating cells during the first pregnancy and lactation cycle. They do not undergo apoptosis during postlactational remodeling, and they persist throughout the remainder of a female’s life. In this review, we discuss the biological relevance of PI-MECs in multiparous females and their important stem cell-like features, such as self renewal, as well as their ability to produce progeny with diverse cellular fates.

The mammalian Rho GTPases Rac 1 and Cdc 42 are molecular switches that control many cellular processes, but are best known for their roles in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Here we employed podocyte-specific <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>technology</b> and found that mice with deletion of Rac 1 display normal podocyte morphology without glomerular dysfunction well into adulthood. Using the protamine sulfate model of acute podocyte injury, podocyte-specific deletion of Rac 1 prevented foot process effacement. In a long-term model of chronic hypertensive glomerular damage, however, loss of Rac 1 led to an exacerbation of albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis. In contrast, mice with podocyte-specific deletion of Cdc 42 had severe proteinuria, podocyte foot process effacement, and glomerulosclerosis beginning as early as 10 days of age. In addition, slit diaphragm proteins nephrin and podocin were redistributed and cofilin was de-phosphorylated.

40|$|Continuous {{taste bud}} cell renewal is {{essential}} to maintain taste function in adults; however, the molecular mechanisms that regulate taste cell turnover are unknown. Using inducible <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>technology,</b> we show that activation of β-catenin signaling in multipotent lingual epithelial progenitors outside of taste buds diverts daughter cells from a general epithelial to a taste bud fate. Moreover, while taste buds comprise 3 morphological types, β-catenin activation drives overproduction of primarily glial-like Type I taste cells in both anterior fungiform (FF) and posterior circumvallate (CV) taste buds, with a small increase in Type II receptor cells for sweet, bitter and umami, but does not alter Type III sour detector cells. Beta-catenin activation in post-mitotic taste bud precursors likewise regulates cell differentiation; forced activation of β-catenin in these Shh+ cells promotes Type I cell fate in both FF and CV taste buds, but likely does so non-cell autonomously. Our data are consistent with a model where β-catenin signaling levels within lingual epithelial progenitors dictate cell fate prior to or during entry of new cells into taste buds; high signaling induces Type I cells, intermediate levels drive Type II cell differentiation, while low levels may drive differentiation of Type III cells...|$|E

Cortical interneurons expressing calbindin, parvalbumin, and somatostatin are generated exclusively from Lhx 6 (Lim homeobox 6) -expressing precursors in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE). Martinotti cells that coexpress calretinin and somatostatin are generated from the dorsal region of the MGE neuroepithelium that expresses Nkx 6. 2 (NK 2 transcription factor-related 6. 2). Most neuropeptide Y-expressing cells and all bipolar calretinin-expressing interneurons are generated outside the MGE, from the germinal zones of the lateral/caudal ganglionic eminences that express Gsh 2 (genomic screened homeobox 2).

Hunk is a SNF 1 (sucrose non fermenting 1) -related serine / threonine kinase that was originally cloned by Korobko et al. [2, 3] and Gardner et al. [4] but its function still remains largely unknown. A variety of binding partners for Hunk have been identified including Nedd 4 E 3 ubiquitin ligase [5], Synaptopodin [6], Rabaptin- 5 [7] and cofilin- 1 [8], al-though the molecular mechanisms of Hunk action remain * Correspondence...|$|E
40|$|The p 53 tumor {{suppressor}} limits proliferation {{in response}} to cellular stress through several mechanisms. Here, we test whether the recently described ability of p 53 to limit stem cell self-renewal suppresses tumorigenesis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an aggressive cancer in which p 53 mutations are associated with drug resistance and adverse outcome. Our approach combined mosaic mouse models, <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>technology,</b> and in vivo RNAi to disable p 53 and simultaneously activate endogenous Kras(G 12 D) -a common AML lesion that promotes proliferation but not self-renewal. We show that p 53 inactivation strongly cooperates with oncogenic Kras(G 12 D) to induce aggressive AML, while both lesions on their own induce T-cell malignancies with long latency. This synergy {{is based on a}} pivotal role of p 53 in limiting aberrant self-renewal of myeloid progenitor cells, such that loss of p 53 counters the deleterious effects of oncogenic Kras on these cells and enables them to self-renew indefinitely. Consequently, myeloid progenitor cells expressing oncogenic Kras and lacking p 53 become leukemia-initiating cells, resembling cancer stem cells capable of maintaining AML in vivo. Our results establish an efficient new strategy for interrogating oncogene cooperation, and provide strong evidence that the ability of p 53 to limit aberrant self-renewal contributes to its tumor suppressor activity...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in α, β, or γ {{subunits}} of the epithelial {{sodium channel}} (ENaC) can downregulate ENaC activity and cause a severe salt-losing syndrome with hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis, designated pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 in humans. In contrast, mice with selective inactivation of αENaC in the collecting duct (CD) maintain sodium and potassium balance, {{suggesting that the}} late distal convoluted tubule (DCT 2) and/or the connecting tubule (CNT) participates in sodium homeostasis. To investigate {{the relative importance of}} ENaC-mediated sodium absorption in the CNT, we used <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>technology</b> to generate mice lacking αENaC in the aquaporin 2 -expressing CNT and CD. Western blot analysis of microdissected cortical CD (CCD) and CNT revealed absence of αENaC in the CCD and weak αENaC expression in the CNT. These mice exhibited a significantly higher urinary sodium excretion, a lower urine osmolality, and an increased urine volume compared with control mice. Furthermore, serum sodium was lower and potassium levels were higher in the genetically modified mice. With dietary sodium restriction, these mice experienced significant weight loss, increased urinary sodium excretion, and hyperkalemia. Plasma aldosterone levels were significantly elevated under both standard and sodium-restricted diets. In summary, αENaC expression within the CNT/CD is crucial for sodium and potassium homeostasis and causes signs and symptoms of pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 if missing...|$|E
40|$|Although {{deregulation}} of the Wnt signalling pathway has been implicated in urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC), the functional significance is unknown. To test its importance, we have targeted expression of an activated form of beta-catenin to the urothelium of transgenic mice using <b>Cre-Lox</b> <b>technology</b> (UroIICRE(+) beta-catenin(exon 3 /+)). Expression of this activated form of beta-catenin {{led to the formation}} of localized hyperproliferative lesions by 3 months, which did not progress to malignancy. These lesions were characterized by a marked increase of the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) tumour suppressor protein. This appears to be a direct consequence of activating Wnt signalling in the bladder as conditional deletion of the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) gene within the adult bladder led rapidly to coincident beta-catenin and PTEN expression. This PTEN expression blocked proliferation. Next, we combined PTEN deficiency with beta-catenin activation and found that this caused papillary UCC. These tumours had increased pAKT signalling and were dependent on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Importantly, in human UCC, there was a significant correlation between high levels of beta-catenin and pAKT (and low levels of PTEN). Taken together these data show that deregulated Wnt signalling has a critical role in promoting UCC, and suggests that human UCC that have high levels of Wnt and PI 3 kinase signalling may be responsive to mTOR inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Selenoproteins are {{essential}} molecules for the mammalian antioxidant network. We previously demonstrated that targeted loss of all selenoproteins in mouse epidermis disrupted {{skin and hair}} development, and caused premature death. In the current study, we targeted specific selenoproteins for epidermal deletion to determine whether similar phenotypes developed. Keratinocyte-specific knockout mice lacking either the glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx 4) or thioredoxin reductase 1 (TR 1) gene were generated by <b>cre-lox</b> <b>technology</b> using K 14 -cre. TR 1 knockout mice had a normal phenotype in resting skin, whereas GPx 4 loss in the epidermis caused epidermal hyperplasia, dermal inflammatory infiltrate, dysmorphic hair follicles, and alopecia in perinatal mice. Unlike epidermal ablation of all selenoproteins, mice ablated for GPx 4 recovered after 5 weeks and had a normal life span. GPx 1 and TR 1 were upregulated in the skin and keratinocytes of GPx 4 -knockout mice. GPx 4 deletion reduces keratinocyte adhesion in culture and increases lipid peroxidation and cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) levels in cultured keratinocytes and whole skin. Feeding a COX- 2 inhibitor to nursing mothers partially prevents development of the abnormal skin phenotype in knockout pups. These data link the activity of cutaneous GPx 4 to the regulation of COX- 2 and hair follicle morphogenesis, and {{provide insight into the}} function of individual selenoprotein activity in maintaining cutaneous homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Neural {{precursor}} cells (NPCs) can be isolated from various {{regions of the}} postnatal central nervous system (CNS). Manipulation of gene expression in these cells offers a promising strategy to manipulate their fate both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we developed a technique that allows the transient manipulation of single/multiple gene expression in NPCs in vitro, and the long-term tracking of their progeny both in vitro and in vivo. Results In order to combine the advantages of transient transfection with the long-term tracking of the transfected cells progeny, we developed a new approach based on the <b>cre-lox</b> <b>technology.</b> We first established a fast and reliable protocol to isolate and culture NPCs as monolayer, from the spinal cord of neonatal transgenic Rosa 26 -YFP cre-reporter mice. These cells could be reliably transfected with single/multiple plasmids by nucleofection. Nucleofection with mono- or bicistronic plasmids containing the Cre recombinase gene resulted in efficient recombination and the long-term expression of the YFP-reporter gene. The transient cre-expression was non-toxic for the transfected cells and did not alter their intrinsic properties. Finally, we demonstrated that cre-transfected cells could be transplanted into the adult brain, where they maintained YFP expression permitting long-term tracking of their migration and differentiation. Conclusion This approach allows single/multiple genes to be manipulated in NPCs, {{while at the same}} time allowing long-term tracking of the transfected cells progeny to be analyzed both in vitro and in vivo. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMuscle {{stem cells}} and their progeny play a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} regeneration of adult skeletal muscle. We have previously shown that activation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in adult myogenic progenitors is required for their transition from rapidly dividing transient amplifying cells to more differentiated progenitors. Whereas Wnt signaling in Drosophila is dependent on the presence of the co-regulator Legless, previous studies of the mammalian ortholog of Legless, BCL 9 (and its homolog, BCL 9 - 2), have not revealed an essential role of these proteins in Wnt signaling in specific tissues during development. Using <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>technology</b> to delete BCL 9 and BCL 9 - 2 in the myogenic lineage in vivo and RNAi technology to knockdown the protein levels in vitro, we show that BCL 9 is required for activation of the Wnt/β-catenin cascade in adult mammalian myogenic progenitors. We observed that the nuclear localization of β-catenin and downstream TCF/LEF-mediated transcription, which are normally observed in myogenic progenitors upon addition of exogenous Wnt and during muscle regeneration, were abrogated when BCL 9 / 9 - 2 levels were reduced. Furthermore, reductions of BCL 9 / 9 - 2 inhibited the promotion of myogenic differentiation by Wnt and the normal regenerative response of skeletal muscle. These results suggest a critical role of BCL 9 / 9 - 2 in the Wnt-mediated regulation of adult, as opposed to embryonic, myogenic progenitors...|$|E
40|$|Background—A {{variety of}} studies carried out using either human {{subjects}} or laboratory animals suggest that vitamin D and its analogues possess important beneficial {{activity in the}} cardiovascular system. Using <b>Cre-Lox</b> <b>technology</b> we have selectively deleted the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene in the cardiac myocyte {{in an effort to}} better understand the role of vitamin D in regulating myocyte structure and function. Methods and Results—Targeted deletion of the exon 4 coding sequence in the VDR gene resulted in an increase in myocyte size and left ventricular weight/body weight versus controls both at baseline and following a 7 -day infusion of isoproterenol. There was no increase in interstitial fibrosis. These knockout mice demonstrated a reduction in end-diastolic and end-systolic volume by echocardiography, activation of the fetal gene program (ie, increased atrial natriuretic peptide and alpha skeletal actin gene expression), and increased expression of modulatory calcineurin inhibitory protein 1 (MCIP 1), a direct downstream target of calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cell signaling. Treatment of neonatal cardiomyocytes with 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D partially reduced isoproterenol-induced MCIP 1 mRNA and protein levels and MCIP 1 gene promoter activity. Conclusions—Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the vitamin D-VDR signaling system possesses direct, antihypertrophic activity in the heart. This appears to involve, at least in part, suppression of the prohypertrophic calcineurin/NFAT/MCIP 1 pathway. These studies identify a potential mechanism to account for the reported beneficial effects of vitamin D in the cardiovascular system. (Circulation. 2011; 124 : 1838 - 1847. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{extracellular}} {{superoxide dismutase}} 3 (SOD 3) is highly expressed in both {{blood vessels and}} lungs. In different models of pulmonary injury, SOD 3 is reduced; however, {{it is unclear whether}} this contributes to lung injury. To study the role of acute SOD 3 reduction in lung injury, the SOD 3 gene was deleted in adult mice by using the <b>Cre-Lox</b> <b>technology.</b> Acute reduction of SOD 3 led to a fivefold increase in lung superoxide, marked inflammatory cell infiltration, a threefold increase in the arterial-alveolar gradient, respiratory acidosis, histological changes similar to those observed in adult respiratory distress syndrome, and 85 % mortality. Treatment with the SOD mimetic MnTBAP and intranasal administration of SOD-containing polyketal microparticles reduced mortality, prevented the histological alterations, and reduced lung superoxide levels. To understand how mice with the SOD 3 embryonic deletion survived without lung injury, gene array analysis was performed. These data demonstrated the up-regulation of 37 genes and down-regulation of nine genes, including those involved in cell signaling, inflammation, and gene transcription in SOD 3 -/- mice compared with either mice with acute SOD 3 reduction or wild-type controls. These studies show that SOD 3 is essential for survival in the presence of ambient oxygen and that acute loss of this enzyme can lead to severe lung damage. Strategies either to prevent SOD 3 inactivation or to augment its levels might prove useful in the treatment of acute lung injury...|$|E
