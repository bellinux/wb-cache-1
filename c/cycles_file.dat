40|$|Abstract—Interleaving codewords is an {{important}} method not only for combatting burst errors, but also for distributed data re-trieval. This paper introduces the concept of multicluster inter-leaving (MCI), a generalization of traditional interleaving prob-lems. MCI problems for paths and cycles are studied. The following problem is solved: how to interleave integers on a path or cycle such that any (2) nonoverlapping clusters of order 2 in the path or cycle have at least three distinct integers. We then present a scheme using a “hierarchical-chain structure ” to solve the fol-lowing more general problem for paths: how to interleave integers on a path such that any (2) nonoverlapping clusters of order (2) in the path have at least + 1 distinct integers. It is shown that the scheme solves the second interleaving problem for paths that are asymptotically {{as long as the}} longest path on which an MCI exists, and clearly, for shorter paths as well.

30|$|During the 1 st {{growing cycle}} of soil 1, biochar {{application}} (with or without N) significantly increased tissue K concentration compared to N alone and control treatments (Table  3). Addition of N in soil 2 {{did not provide}} significant increase in tissue K concentration over both growing cycles. However, N application promoted significant tissue K concentration in soil 1. With {{the exception of the}} lowest biochar level (10  t ha− 1), all biochar treatments, with and without N, induced significant residual tissue K concentrations in both soils. For both soils, tissue K concentrations of all biochar treatments but two biochar with N combinations in the 1 st growing cycle of soil 2 (30  t ha− 1 with 50  kg N ha− 1 and 20  t ha− 1 with 50  kg N ha− 1) were within the optimum range (Ludwick 2002). These results imply that the biochar served as a source of K beyond one cropping cycle likewise available P. Generally, the increase in tissue K content in response to biochar application in this study is in conformity with the findings of several researchers (Chan et al. 2007; Steiner et al. 2007; Chan et al. 2008; Gaskin et al. 2010), who were able to establish that the increase was due to high concentration of available K in biochars. Given the high N content with a very low C to N ratio (C/N =  9.7) of the biochar, the tissue N content of lettuce plants under biochar application was expected to be high. However, biochar application, without N, did not increase tissue N content even at the highest rate of application (30  t ha− 1) compared to N alone applications in the 1 st growing cycle of both soils, indicating that N of biochar was not available for uptake over the short term (12  weeks). These results contrast with the findings of Chan et al. (2008) and Tagoe et al. (2008) who reported that biochars derived from N rich feedstock did furnish N for plants in the 1 st cropping cycle. During the 2 nd growing cycle, {{with the exception of the}} lowest N level (25  kg N ha− 1) for soil 1 and biochar level (10  t ha− 1) for soil 2, all biochar treatments induced significant residual tissue N concentrations compared to the controls. In both experiments contrast tests also showed that biochar with N class produced lettuce plants of significantly lower tissue N concentration compared to N alone class in the 1 st growing <b>cycle</b> (Additional <b>file</b> 2 : Table  4 S, 5 S). Conversely, biochar with N class promoted significantly higher residual tissue N content over N alone class in soil 1. The observed change in residual tissue N concentration under biochar application could indicate mineralization was taking place in the 2 nd growing cycle. In both experiments, biochar with and without N classes promoted significant tissue Mg concentration compared with the control and N alone classes over both growing <b>cycles</b> (Additional <b>file</b> 2 : Table  4 S, 5 S). Similarly, Uzoma et al. (2011) reported that cow manure biochar addition at high application rate (20  t ha− 1) significantly enhanced maize grain Mg content. The concentrations of tissue Ca were very high under biochar with N class in both soils over both growing <b>cycles</b> (Additional <b>file</b> 2 : Table  4 S, 5 S). This result was in agreement with Gaskin et al. (2010) and Kloss et al. (2014), who reported that combined application of biochar with N significantly increased tissue Ca concentration of plants.|$|R
30|$|Each {{landscape}} {{is characterized by}} a relative proportion of trees originating from various fire periods. To define the fire cycle for each landscape, we associated an age to each fire period (ex. 1920 [*]=[*] 80  years in 2000) and calculated a weighted mean, which corresponds to the fire cycle (Bergeron et al. 2001). Fire cycle mapping was compared to species distribution to determine whether the shortest fire cycle was associated with fire-prone species, such as Pinus banksiana (Dix & Swan 1971). Considering the small difference in fire cycles of adjacent landscapes, we grouped these landscapes to form three main fire <b>cycles</b> (Additional <b>file</b> 1 : Appendix 3). These fire cycles were subsequently used to characterize the age structure of each landscape by considering the negative exponential proposed by Van Wagner (1978) (Additional file 1 : Appendix 2).

40|$|The {{key issues}} for {{register}} file design in high-performance processors are access time and energy. While previous work {{has focused on}} {{reducing the number of}} registers, we propose {{to reduce the number of}} register ports through two proposals, one for reads and the other for writes. For reads, we propose bypass hint to reduce register port requirements by avoiding unnecessary register file reads for cases where values are bypassed. Current processors are unable to avoid these unnecessary reads due to timing constraints. For writes, we use register file banking. Current banking schemes assign different banks to instructions that are renamed together, which does not necessarily avoid conflicts among instructions that writeback together. We use decoupled rename, a technique which separates dependence and physical tagging of register operands. Decoupled rename allows us to perform physical register allocation just before writeback, avoiding bank conflicts. Our results show that combining bypass hint and write banking, our 1 <b>cycle</b> register <b>file</b> with 6 read ports, and two 4 -write-ported banks achieves a 9 % processor energy-delay savings over a system using a perfectly-pipelined, 2 -cycle register file with 16 read ports and 8 write ports. ...|$|R

However, {{with the increase of}} MnO 2, the CV curves change a little and even no capacitance decrease is observed (as shown in Additional file 1 : Figure S 3 C,D,E). Compared with PANI samples obtained at higher acid concentration, MnO 2 /PANI nanocomposites possess noticeable capacitive stability. To investigate the long-term stability of as-prepared MnO 2 /PANI nanocomposites, the charge–discharge test of 1, 000 cycles was conducted at 1 [*]mA[*]cm− 2 in 0.1 M HClO 4. As shown in Figure[*] 6 C (first 20 cycles are shown for clearly observation), the E-t plots are symmetric in shape and have almost no change during the long-term test. From Figure[*] 6 D, {{it can be seen that}} the discrepancy of capacitance of MnO 2 /PANI during 2, 000 -cycle test is lower than 5 %, and there is no evident capacitance decrease after 1, 000 [*]cycles. The stability of the MnO 2 /PANI composite is thought due to the protection of the shield-surrounded PANI and uniform dispersion of MnO 2 particles, whereby avoiding severe particles conglomeration involved in the charge–discharge process [35, 36]. The facile synthesis and ideal electrochemical capacitive performance will probably give the composites a promising prospect in the application of supercapacitors.|$|R

We looked at processors capable of issuing either four or eight instructions per cycle and found that in most cases implementing precise exceptions requires {{a relatively small number}} of additional registers compared to imprecise exceptions. Systems with aggressive non-blocking load support were able to achieve performance similar to processors with perfect memory systems at the cost of some additional registers. Given our machine assumptions, we found that the performance of a four-issue machine with a 32 -entry dispatch queue tends to saturate around 80 registers. For an eight-issue machine with a 64 -entry dispatch queue performance does not saturate until about 128 registers. Assuming the machine cycle time is proportional to the register <b>file</b> <b>cycle</b> time, the 8 -issue machine yields only 20 % higher performance than the 4 -issue machine due in part to the cycle time impact of additional hardware. ...|$|R

We then extend our method to plasmas in hydrodynamic conditions and apply it to plane problems: the system of partial differential equations may be partially solved and sometimes even completely reduced to a family of decoupled systems of ordinary ones; this occurs e. g. with the impact of the travelling wave on a vacuum-plasma interface (what may produce the slingshot effect).

This is called a directory file set, and a 256 MiB sub-directory can hold up to 2,796,202 file sets. (If files have longer names, this number will decrease but this is the maximum based on the minimum three-record file set.) To help improve the sequential searching of the directories (including the root) a hash value of the file name is derived for each file and stored in the directory record. When searching for a file, the file name is first converted to upper case using the upcase table (file names are case insensitive) and then hashed using a proprietary patented algorithm into a 16-bit (2 byte) hash value. Each record in the directory is searched by comparing the hash value. When a match is found, the file names are compared to ensure that the proper file was located in case of hash collisions. This improves performance because only 2 bytes have to be compared for each file.

Methods: Thirty K 3 files, size # 25, taper 0. 04, were divided into 3 experimental groups as follows: group A, 12 files exposed to nitrogen ion implantation at a dose of 2. 5 x 10 (17) ions/cm(2), accelerating voltage of 200 kV, currents of 1 mu A/cm(2), 130 degrees C temperature, and vacuum conditions of 10 x 10 (- 6) torr for 6 hours; group B, 12 nonimplanted files; and group C, 6 files submitted to thermal annealing for 6 hours at 130 degrees C. One extra file was used for process control. All files were submitted to a cyclic fatigue test that was performed with an apparatus that allowed the instruments to rotate freely, simulating rotary instrumentation of a curved canal (40 -degree, 5 -mm radius curve). An electric motor handpiece was used with a contra-angle of 16 : 1 at an operating speed of 300 rpm and a torque of 2 N-cm. Time to failure was recorded with a stopwatch in seconds and subsequently converted to number of cycles to fracture. Data were analyzed with the Student t test (P <. 05). Results: Ion-implanted instruments reached significantly higher cycle numbers before fracture (mean, 510 cycles) when compared with annealed (mean, 428 <b>cycles)</b> and nonimplanted <b>files</b> (mean, 381 <b>cycles).</b> Conclusions: Our results showed that nitrogen ion implantation improves cyclic fatigue resistance in rotary nickel-titanium instruments.

WRF-Chem The file WRF-Chem_DustDRE_monthly_allbins. nc in the repository includes the data for the WRF-Chem simulation of the global dust <b>cycle.</b> This <b>file</b> contains the following fields: 	TAUAER 3 : the AOD at 600 nm for all aerosols for each model vertical layer (lat x lon x level x month). 	TAUAER 3 _s 1 through TAUAER 3 _s 8 : TAUAER 3 _sx contains monthly-averaged AOD at 600 nm for each model vertical layer for all aerosols *except* for dust bin x. so the DAOD due to dust bin x is obtained from TAUAER 3 -TAUAER 3 _sx (lat x lon x level x month).

LWUPT_S 1 through LWUPT_S 8 : LWUPT_Sx is the flux with all aerosols present *except* dust bin x. So the radiative effect due to dust bin x is LWUPT-LWUPT_Sx (lat x lon x month).

SWDNT_S 1 through SWDNT_S 8 : SWDNT_Sx is the flux with all aerosols present *except* dust bin x. So the radiative effect due to dust bin x is SWDNT-SWDNT_Sx (lat x lon x month).
