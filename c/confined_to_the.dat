5|$|As for The Five, {{the group}} had long since dispersed, Mussorgsky had died in 1881 and Borodin had {{followed}} in 1887. Cui continued to write negative reviews of Tchaikovsky's music but was seen by the composer as merely a critical irritant. Balakirev lived in isolation and was <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> musical sidelines. Only Rimsky-Korsakov remained fully active as a composer.|$|E

5|$|Ettore Fieramosca had a {{relatively}} uneventful career; her first decade in service was <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> normal peacetime routine of training with the Italian fleet.

She was stricken from the naval register in July 1909 and sold for scrap.|$|E

The strongest winds were <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic coastline, with outer rainbands producing heavy rainfall in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland. Fierce winds {{were observed in}} Cape Henlopen, Delaware, with the strongest gales occurring after the eye passed over the area.|$|E
5|$|His accomplishments {{were not}} <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> track. He was deeply resentful toward the {{treatment}} given toward amateur athletes.

5|$|In 2010, Whitlock et al. {{described}} a juvenile skull {{at the time}} referred to Diplodocus (CM11255) that differed greatly from adult skulls of the same genus: its snout was not blunt, and the teeth were not <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front of the snout. These differences suggest that adults and juveniles were feeding differently. Such an ecological difference between adults and juveniles had not been previously observed in sauropodomorphs.|$|E

5|$|In ctenophores, {{bioluminescence}} {{is caused}} by the activation of calcium-activated proteins named photoproteins in cells called photocytes, which are often <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> meridional canals that underlie the eight comb rows. In the genome of Mnemiopsis leidyi ten genes encode photoproteins. These genes are co-expressed with opsin genes in the developing photocytes of Mnemiopsis leidyi, raising the possibility that light production and light detection may be working together in these animals.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century {{there were}} {{numerous}} Russian loanwords concerning daily life: doktor (doctor), shokolad (chocolate), vagon (train wagon), kalendar (calendar), sistem, podvoolk (from futbolka T-shirt), and mashin (car). In more recent times, due to socio-political changes, Mongolian has loaned various words from English; some which have gradually evolved as official terms: menejment, computer, fail (file), marketing, kredit, onlain (online), mesej (message). Most of the latter are <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mongolian state.|$|E
