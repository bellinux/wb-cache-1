The school's stated goals were [...] "to train {{the people of}} Jerusalem in crafts, develop {{original}} Jewish art and support Jewish artists, and to find visual expression for the much yearned-for national and spiritual independence that seeks to create a synthesis between European artistic traditions and the Jewish design traditions of the East and West, and to integrate it with the local culture of the Land of Israel.” In 1908, the school moved to a permanent home on what became Shmuel Hanagid Street, which allowed more departments to be opened and the scope of activities expanded. Of the three buildings Schatz purchased from a wealthy Arab. one was his personal residence {{and the other two}} housed the art school and a national art museum. The school was established based on the Russian concept of an arts and <b>crafts</b> <b>school</b> and <b>workshop.</b> Bezalel's motto was [...] "Art is the bud, craft is the fruit." [...] The school offered instruction in painting and sculpture alongside crafts such as carpet making, metalworking and woodcarving.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Education)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003. Workshop {{educators}} {{have a legal}} duty with regard to health and safety in the <b>school</b> <b>workshop</b> {{for the protection of}} the learners in their care. It is expected of the workshop educators to look after the learners placed in their care as a conscientious and solicitous parent would. The workshop educator's discretion and conduct should always be based on predictable and preventable action. Because learners cannot possibly have the discernment of adults concerning more or less dangerous situations, the workshop educator should make provision for this possibility in the health and safety management of the <b>school</b> <b>workshop.</b> Common law principles such as duty of care, predictability and preventability, in addition to requirements for delictual liability (an act, unlawfulness, fault, causality and damage) demarcate and elucidate the role of the workshop educator who is responsible for the safety management of the <b>school</b> <b>workshop.</b> Workshop educators should ascertain that they are familiar with all these principles. A literature survey was undertaken with regard to these matters. Although workshop educators are responsible for the health and safety of the learners in their care, the literature survey revealed that health and safety in workshops in general is addressed and made compulsory by legislation, but that the specific needs of the <b>school</b> <b>workshop</b> are not adequately addressed. The aims of the empirical research were to determine: • the functioning of health and safety management in the contemporary <b>school</b> <b>workshop</b> and • to what extent the workshop educator is equipped for his duty of care responsibility with regards to the health and safety of the learners placed in his care. Questions were asked on the knowledge and execution of health and safety rules laid down by legislation, as well as the knowledge and execution of safety rules which are not necessarily laid down by legislation. Questions on safety rules devised by the respondents to improve the health and safety in the <b>school</b> <b>workshop</b> were also included in the questionnaire. The empirical study lead to the following: • The respondents seemed to have a reasonable knowledge of general health and safety rules laid down by legislation but in questions asked to verify the above mentioned answers, it seemed that the respondents were in some cases ignorant about these health and safety rules. Some of the respondents seem to ignore the safety rules in the execution of the health and safety rules. • A small number of the respondents seem to have a good knowledge of health and safety rules which are not necessarily laid down by legislation. • Quite a number of the respondents reported health and safety rules specifically devised for <b>school</b> <b>workshops</b> by their respective schools. Specific recommendations have been made and a model for health and safety management in the <b>school</b> <b>workshop</b> has been devised. This model should lead to better health and safety management in the <b>school</b> <b>workshop</b> and should thus ensure a safer <b>school</b> <b>workshop</b> for learners. Doctora...|$|R
