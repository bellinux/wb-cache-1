50|$|Bikes with a 'floating drivetrain' or 'floating bottom bracket' can use {{any type}} of {{suspension}} system to suspend the rear wheel from the frame, but use linkages to connect the <b>crank</b> <b>assembly</b> to the frame and rear suspension. Since the linkages {{are connected to the}} rear suspension, suspension movement causes the <b>crank</b> <b>assembly</b> to move as well. The floating drivetrain is often employed to compensate for the disadvantages of a particular rear suspension system so the design can make better use of its advantages.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Independent Drivetrain" [...] (or [...] "IDrive") is a four-bar {{suspension}} system for bicycle <b>crank</b> <b>assemblies,</b> {{the rear wheel}} itself is suspended as single pivot suspension. It was developed by mountain bike suspension designer Jim Busby Jr. and was {{a direct result of}} the limitations encountered with the GT LTS (GT Bicycles' [...] "Links Tuned Suspension) four-bar linkage design used by GT Bicycles from 1993 to 1998. The IDrive attempts to maximize the efficiency of the transmission of energy from the rider to the rear wheel. The bottom bracket is placed eccentric in a bearing within the swingarm, the distance between the center of the bearing and the bottom bracket effectively creating a very short link, and the swingarm itself creating another. A link between bearing shell and frame then completes the four-bar linkage with the bottom bracket on the floating link and the linkage as a whole actuated by movement of the swingarm.|$|R
50|$|Some {{parts from}} the Generation II are {{interchangeable}} with the Generation I one-piece rear main seal engine. The interchangeable parts include the rotating <b>assembly</b> (<b>crank</b> shaft, pistons, connecting rods, and flywheel/flexplate) and valvetrain assembly (not including timing set, {{which includes a}} gear to drive the water pump). The LT1 uses a new engine block, cylinder head, timing cover, water pump, intake manifold and accessory brackets. The harmonic damper also does not interchange; it is a unique damper/pulley assembly. Engine mounts and bell housing bolt pattern remain the same, permitting a newer engine to be readily swapped into an older vehicle.|$|R

40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of the University of Maryland walking machine was completed during the 1989 to 1990 academic year. It was required that the machine be capable of completing a number of tasks including walking a straight line, turning to change direction, and manuevering over an obstacle such {{as a set of}} stairs. The machine consists of two sets of four telescoping legs that alternately support the entire structure. A gear box and <b>crank</b> arm <b>assembly</b> is connected to the leg sets to provide the power required for the translational motion of the machine. By retracting all eight legs, the robot comes to rest on a central Bigfoot support. Turning is accomplished by rotating this machine about this support. The machine can be controlled by using either a user-operated remote tether or the onboard computer for the execution of control commands. Absolute encoders are attached to all motors to provide the control computer with information regarding the status of the motors. Long and short range infrared sensors provide the computer with feedback information regarding the machine's position relative to a series of stripes and reflectors. These infrared sensors simulate how the robot might sense and gain information about the environment of Mars...|$|R
5000|$|Luny Tunes was reggaeton's {{first major}} hitmaking {{production}} team, <b>cranking</b> out an <b>assembly</b> line of hit singles, club anthems, and CD mixtapes, {{all the while}} collaborating {{with many of the}} style's top vocalists. Ivy Queen {{was the first person to}} work Luny Tunes when they produced her single [...] "Quiero Saber", as she trusted their talent. Luny Tunes were given their big break by DJ Nelson, a reggaeton pioneer who recognized their production talents, which had been well showcased on Hector & Tito's A La Reconquista (2002), and signed them to his Flow Music label. Luny Tunes in turn made their major-label debut, alongside another promising young production talent, Noriega, on Mas Flow (2003). The CD mixtape featured most of reggaeton's top vocalists of the time (Daddy Yankee, Don Omar, Tego Calderón, Wisin & Yandel, Hector & Tito, Zion & Lennox, Baby Ranks, Nicky Jam, Trebol Clan, and many more) and firmly established the duo as a go-to production team. The CD was a huge commercial success in Latin America and was one of the top Latin albums in the United States.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to design and {{evaluate}} a simple bioreactor system capable of medium term culture of native and engineered aortic valves. It is thought that cyclic mechanical stimulation is necessary to maintain the normal morphology of the tissue. The current design permits the cyclic opening and closing of 3 aortic valves, however this device could easily be modified to culture up to 12 valves simultaneously. The system consists of 3 pistons in separate culture chambers that are driven through the culture medium at the same rate by a <b>crank</b> and cam <b>assembly.</b> The faces of these pistons have unidirectional valves mounted in opposing orientations that permit flow from one side of the face to the other. A custom designed stent was employed to secure the biologic (porcine or engineered) valves to the pistons. Basic CFD and FEA modeling was used to assist selection of materials and components in the system. Finally, sterility testing was done using medium without antibiotics and samples were inspected at experimentally relevant time points. This new bioreactor system has applications not only for development of tissue-engineered valves, but for also studying disease models in the aortic valve...|$|R
50|$|The Puckle gun {{was fired}} {{in a similar fashion}} to a {{conventional}} flintlock musket; however, after each shot, a crank on the threaded shaft at the rear would be unscrewed to release the cylinder to turn freely. The cylinder would then be advanced by hand to the next chamber, and the crank turned back again to lock the cylinder into the breech of the fixed barrel. The flintlock mechanism could then be primed for another shot: it was triggered using a lever which was separate from the <b>crank</b> <b>assembly.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} paraplegics and other individuals {{with little or}} no use of their legs, many manufacturers have designed and released hand-powered recumbent trikes, or handcycles. Handcycles are a regular sight at HPV meetings and are beginning to be seen on the streets. They usually follow a delta design with front wheels driven by standard dérailleur gearing powered by hand cranks. Brake levers are usually mounted on the hand holds, which are usually set with no offset rather than the 180° of pedal cranks. The entire <b>crank</b> <b>assembly</b> and the front wheel turn together, allowing the rider to steer and crank simultaneously.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references: leaf 19. Bottom bracket failures {{have been one of the}} most common failures in the composite bicycle frames produced by the Trek Bicycle Corporation. The bottom bracket is the portion of the frame that supports the crank and pedals. An aluminum insert is chemically adhered to the composite shell of the Trek frames with an epoxy. This insert is the attachment point for the <b>crank</b> <b>assembly,</b> so it is exposed to cyclical and often relatively large loads. The most common failure is a disbond in the epoxy. This research analyzed a composite bicycle frame using finite element analysis software to help determine the stresses in the frame about the point of failure. A model of the entire frame and a more detailed model of the bottom bracket region were constructed to perform the analysis. The model of the frame was analyzed using a static analysis and loads specified by Trek. Results from the frame model were then applied to the bottom bracket model for analysis. Stresses as high as 320 MPa (46, 500 psi) resulted. The stresses and the resultant strains cause the failure. A different epoxy resin or a different manufacturing process will be required to remedy this problem...|$|E
