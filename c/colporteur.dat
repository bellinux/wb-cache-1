At a May, 1919 convention in Ohio he announced {{the publication of a}} new magazine, The Golden Age (later renamed Awake!). Because Russell's will had decreed the Society should publish no other periodicals the new magazine was at first published by [...] "Woodworth, Hudgings & Martin", with a Manhattan (rather than Brooklyn) address. Within months Bible Students were organized to distribute it door-to-door. He expanded the Society's printing facilities, revived the <b>colporteur</b> work and in 1920 introduced the requirement for weekly reports of Bible Students' preaching activity. He expanded and reorganized overseas branch offices in what he regarded as a [...] "cleansing" [...] and [...] "sifting" [...] work.|$|E

2500|$|Irvine met John Long, a Methodist <b>colporteur,</b> in March 1897 in Kilrush, S. Ireland. [...] "At this time, Irvine {{had a big}} {{reputation}} as a Faith Mission evangelist [...] "remarkable for saying, 'Praise the Lord,' no matter what happened". [...] John Long describes Irvine as [...] "In either secular or religious matters, he was a born leader of men; he was a holy man, and practical. In personal dealing, he was preeminently the best conversationalist I ever met, and skilful in soul winning. He had a marvelous insight into the deep things of God's word, and like his Master, was an apt teacher of all who received the truth with pleasure. He always set forth the cross, and was a swift witness against all pride, vainglory and hypocrisy; he was severe on Christians, but merciful to sinners. In prayer, praise, and preaching he excelled in joy, liberty, and power. He was very much opposed and misunderstood by religious people; nevertheless, the common people liked him and heard him gladly." [...] Other sources describe Irvine's style of speaking as hypnotic, [...] "sweeter than honey in the honeycomb" [...] and [...] "ferocious" [...] in its sincerity. He was also noted for making outrageous and inflammatory statements, even claiming [...] "I am St. Paul the Second!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Colportage became {{common in}} Europe with the {{distribution}} of contending religious tracts and books during the religious controversies of the Reformation. In addition to controversial works the itinerant, book-peddling <b>colporteurs</b> also spread widely cheap editions of the popular works {{of the day to}} an increasingly literate rural population which had little access to the book shops of the cities. [...] The American Tract Society, an evangelical organization established in 1825 to distribute Christian literature, reported in its 24th annual report in 1849 [...] "Colportage including 106 students from 23 different colleges or seminaries for their vacations....

60|$|Having {{selected}} some New Testaments and Bibles {{from his}} pack, the <b>colporteur</b> handed them round for inspection. These, I found, were {{printed in the}} modern Bulgarian tongue.

At last he proposed to read, and as no objection was made, he read and commented on several passages. Although a German, he spoke Bulgarian fluently, and ere long had aroused considerable interest, for the people {{had little or no}} knowledge of the Bible; the only one to which they had access being that which lay on the pulpit of the Greek Church of the village, and which, being written in the ancient Slavic language, was incomprehensible by them.|$|E
6000|$|Turning to {{this man}} the <b>colporteur</b> said quietly, [...] "Does not death come into public-houses? Don't people die in public-houses?

6000|$|This {{proposal}} was heartily agreed to.

6000|$|The {{result was}} at first {{received}} in dead silence, and with looks of surprise by the majority. This was followed by murmuring comments and some disputes.

60|$|So {{the poor}} <b>colporteur's</b> griefs {{vanished}} away. He was a brave fellow, and had done mighty feats of arms in his time.

I knew his story well, and so I knew how to interpret the compassion that was in his face when he bade me farewell. He supposed I was having a bitter hard time of it.|$|R
