To discuss those questions, I ordered the diagnosis criteria of the diseases anxiety disorders and somatoform disorders of the DSM-IV after the principals of the Information-gain- theory. Afterwards I compared the new order with the order given by the DSM-IV. A patient-based evaluation was not performed. The new, information-gain-based, order was possible with an assistant system, written by Dominik Lübbers in 2001. Its primary goal is to help the physician with differential diagnosis. It was possible to establish a database with all diagnosis and to transform them into the assistant system. With the assistant system, it was possible to calculate the information-gain data.

Methods After premedication, cats were randomly allocated {{to one of three}} groups to secure the airway: 1) v-gel; 2) LM; or 3) ETT (cuff pressure: 20 cm H 2 O). Cats were anaesthetized for elective procedures. The dose of propofol necessary to insert the vgel, LM or ETT, the number of attempts required to achieve insertion and leakage during spontaneous ventilation and CMV at different peak inspiratory pressures (8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 cm H 2 O) were recorded.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients underwent MSCT with 0. 5 -second gantry rotation time. Pre- (4 X 2. 5 mm collimation) and post-contrast (4 X 1 mm collimation) acquisitions during arterial and portal venous phases were performed after intravenous administration of 140 ml of non ionic contrast agent at 4 - 5 ml/s, with a delay time of 25 and 60 seconds, respectively. Pre-contrast scans with 80 and 140 kVp were acquired {{at the same level}} used to assess liver density. Real-time interaction with the post-contrast 3 D data set was performed on a dedicated workstation to determine total and lobar liver volume, and to assess arterial and venous vascular anatomy. RESULTS: Steatosis was found in three patients, who as a consequence were excluded as possible candidates. MSCT correctly identified five cases of arterial anatomical variations: two cases of the right hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery, two cases of the common hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery and one case of the left hepatic artery arising from left gastric artery.

The potential role of pre‐LT biopsy at one centre was explored. MethodsA prospective database of patients undergoing orthotopic LT for radiologically diagnosed HCC at St James's University Hospital, Leeds during 2006 – 2011 was analysed. ResultsA total of 60 predominantly male (85. 0 %) {{patients with}} viral hepatitis were identified. There were discrepancies between radiological and histopathological findings with respect to the number of tumours identified (in 27 patients, 45. 0 %) and their size (in 63 tumours, 64. 3 %). In four (6. 7 %) patients, the largest lesion, which would theoretically have been targeted for biopsy, was not the largest in the explant. Nine (31. 0 %) patients with multifocal HCC had tumours of differing grades. In two (6. 9 %) patients, the largest tumour was well differentiated, but smaller tumours in the explant were poorly differentiated. In one patient, the largest lesion was benign and smaller invasive tumours were confirmed histologically. ConclusionsThe need to optimize selection for LT in HCC remains. In the present series, the largest tumour was not always representative of overall tumour burden or biological aggression and its potential use to exclude patients from LT is questionable...|$|E

In this paper, false-negative reporting of cancer history is examined in a community-based sample by comparing interview data with tumor registry records. Subjects were participants in the 1980 New Haven Epidemiologic Catchment Area study; in 1995, cancer records (from 1935 onward) were obtained by linking the sample to the Connecticut Tumor Registry. Analyses focused on 263 individuals who {{had at least one}} tumor reported to the Connecticut Tumor Registry prior to participation in the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study. The overall rate of false-negative reporting was 39. 2 %. Logistic regression analysis revealed that false-negative reporting was significantly associated with non-White race, older age, increased time since cancer diagnosis, number of previous tumors, and type of cancer treatment received. In addition, false-negative reporting varied widely by cancer site, ranging from 0 % for melanoma skin cancer to 83. 3 % for central nervous system cancers. The false-negative rate for breast cancer was 20. 8 %, that for colon and prostate cancers was 42. 1 %, and that for bladder cancer was 61. 5 %.

The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the prevalence of pre-pregnancy overweight and obesity in the Republic of Srpska and to investigate its association with hyperglycemia and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus. Methods. A cross-sectional study was carried out during the period from February to October 2012 among 555 pregnant women in gestational period from 24 to 28 weeks. The <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> <b>exclusion</b> from the sample was previously diagnosed type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Results. Before pregnancy, 20. 39 % of participants had increased body mass index, while 4. 04 % [95 % confidence interval (CI); 2. 62 – 6. 13] were obese. Gestational diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in 10. 91 % (95 % CI, 8. 44 – 13. 98) of them. The increase in body mass index by 1 increased the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus by 1. 09 times [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 09; 95 % CI; 1. 02 – 1. 16]. Pregnant women who were overweight had a 4. 88 times greater risk (OR = 4. 88; 95 % CI, 1. 23 – 29. 41) of developing gestational diabetes. Conclusion.

30|$|For each idea unit, we {{then decided}} whether to include or exclude the scene as a video case for the rating study. The goal of this process was to provide video cases, which depict how the {{facilitator}} supports teachers’ mathematics learning in the PD course. For each idea unit, the decision to include or exclude the scene {{is based on the}} mathematics content and four exclusion criteria. In terms of mathematics content, we tried to cover all relevant topics of the PD program: chance and probability, descriptive statistics, and combinatorics. From the literature on teachers’ learning of probability and statistics, we know that especially chance, combinatorics, and descriptive statistics are challenging for teachers, as many misconceptions interfere with the mathematical concepts (cf. Shaughnessy 1993). In the process of structuring the video material, we thus paid attention to incidents showing common misconceptions in probability and statistics. The first exclusion criterion is SCK (EC 1). The idea unit treats the understanding of key mathematical concepts and relationships. Hence, scenes showing teachers’ learning not related to SCK were excluded. The second <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> <b>exclusion</b> is PD-PCK (EC 2). The idea units depict vital opportunities for teachers to actively engage in learning. Scenes only showing the facilitator explaining mathematics concepts without further interaction or instruction were excluded. Third, we coded scenes indicative of facilitation moves (EC 3). This criterion describes scenes that show facilitation moves to advance teachers’ learning of mathematics. We excluded, for example, scenes of the PD course showing participants working on tasks individually. The last criterion considers the quality of video and audio (EC 4). To ensure high quality of our video data, we excluded scenes that were difficult to understand.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether outpatients 75 {{years of age}} or older have a higher rate of inadequate bowel preparation for barium enema and of complications associated with the preparation and the test than patients aged 55 to 74 years. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Radiology department in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Patients 55 years or older referred for a barium enema from March to August 1988. OUTCOME MEASURES: All films were reviewed independently by a study radiologist blind to the staff radiologist's report. Patients were interviewed by telephone within several days after the test to assess the occurrence of problems during the preparation or the test. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 213 patients assessed 72 were excluded: 43 refused to participate or could not be contacted, 16 had previously undergone colonic surgery, and 13 were excluded for other reasons. The remaining 141 patients were separated into three age groups: those 55 to 64 years (46 patients), those 65 to 74 (47) and those 75 or older (48). In 104 cases (74 %) the bowel had been prepared adequately; {{there was no significant difference}} between the three groups with regard to the adequacy of preparation. The incidence of problems reported by the patients did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Outpatients aged 75 years or more are no more likely than those aged 55 to 74 to have problems with bowel preparation or the barium enema itself. Age should not be a <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> <b>exclusion</b> from barium enema. To try to lower the rate of poor bowel preparation clinicians and radiologists should consider counselling patients more carefully about the importance of proper preparation.

40|$|NSAIDs {{are among}} the most often {{prescribed}} drugs and some are also sold as OTCs. Even though there is a known risk for developing GI-lesions associated with them, they are considered safe drugs. A pilot-study came to the conclusion, that the risk for fatal GI-bleedings caused by NSAIDs consumption was underestimated, especially among those patients younger the 60 years. The aim of our study was to validate those findings in a larger study population and also to take into account factors such as differences between standard NSAIDs and selective COX- 2 -inhibitors, alcohol consumption, additional drugs such as salicylates, corticosteroids, anticoagulants and SSRIs; and the consumption of “protective” PPIs. A case-control study was conducted at the Institut für Rechtsmedizin der Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin and the Landesinstitut für gerichtliche und soziale Medizin Berlin. „Cases“ were ≥ 20 yrs and had GI-lesions, controls were matched in age and gender. Advanced decay was a <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> <b>exclusion</b> for both groups. Blood samples were extracted from both groups and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively for NSAIDs, salicylates, SSRIs, corticosteroids, anticoagulants and PPIs via HPLC technology. Additionally, blood alcohol was measured with gas chromatography. Lesions were analyzed histopathologically to search for underlying malignancies or infection with H. pylori. During the acquisition period, 3864 autopsies were screened and 194 cases and 190 controls were included into the study. We could not prove our hypothesis, that NSAIDs induce a prior underestimated amount of fatal GI-lesions in younger patients. The Odds-Ratio for developing a GI-lesion due to NSAIDs consumption shortly before death was 1. 66 for our study population. Blood alcohol, salicylates, SSRIs, corticosteroids or anticoagulants did not increase the odds for developing GI-lesions.
