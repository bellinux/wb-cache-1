As a young girl, Tetro's mother once watched Amelia Earhart land her plane in their family's pasture. His father developed a special process for <b>coating</b> water <b>towers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Riff Raff {{announced}} {{his intention to}} release his second studio album Peach Panther on June 1, 2015. The first single, [...] "Spazz Out" [...] featuring production from Travis Barker was released around this time, however the album itself would end up being delayed until 2016. He then released an EP entitled Trench <b>Coat</b> <b>Towers</b> in early November 2015. He extended the release date for Peach Panther several times, with early 2016 being cited on his Instagram as the current date. He was also featured on several singles during 2015, including [...] "Doctor Pepper" [...] with Diplo, CL, and OG Maco, and Flux Pavilion's single [...] "Who Wants to Rock". In early 2016 he released the first single from Peach Panther, [...] "Carlos Slim". The album was eventually released on June 24, 2016.|$|R
50|$|The Church of San Nicola has a {{peculiar}} bell <b>tower</b> <b>coated</b> with yellow and green ceramic tiles. It {{is due to}} Agnone’s craftsmen and medieval architecture that the town adopted the nickname Città d'Arte (City of Art) which the town uses on a promotional basis.|$|R
50|$|One morning, Princess Gudrun of the Niflungs {{approaches}} her mother, the witch-hearted Queen Grimhild, with {{a disturbing}} dream. The Niflungs were hunting a stag {{with a golden}} <b>coat</b> and <b>towering</b> horns which evaded their grasp. It was Gudrun who caught him, only to see him stung with a shaft by a spiteful woman. Her mother then gave Gudrun a wolf to ease her grief and the former bathed her {{in the blood of}} her brothers. Her mother counsels her that evil dreams are often a good omen.|$|R
50|$|The {{arms of the}} See of Toledo {{are based}} upon those of Toledo, Spain, which bears a silver tower on a plain red field. By {{changing}} the field to one half of blue (dexter) and half of red (sinister) the arms are {{significantly different from the}} original, and there is effected, in conjunction with the silver tower, a combination of red, white, and blue—a new and distinctively American Toledo <b>coat.</b> The <b>tower</b> has been marked with a red cross to indicate that the new Toledo is to be ever a Catholic stronghold.|$|R
5000|$|Look Television {{eventually}} {{agreed in}} principle to sell the tower to Convocom, a consortium of west-central Illinois educational institutions. [...] Convocom planned to use the tower for WJPT, a PBS member station serving Springfield and Quincy. However, on March 26, 1978—while financing was still being put together—a severe ice storm <b>coated</b> the <b>tower</b> with thick sheets of ice. With the shifting weight of the antenna, the tower collapsed. It had been designed with the specifications of a lighter antenna, and was thus not properly engineered to sustain so much weight. The same ice storm brought down WAND's tower, which was designed similarly to WJJY's tower.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Transmission line {{systems are}} {{vulnerable}} to winds and storms, particularly in cold climate regions where atmospheric ice accretes on network equipment. This paper describes a method for analyzing wind-induced vibrations of ice <b>coating</b> transmission <b>towers</b> coupled with power lines. An ice coating model of transmission line systems is introduced. Wind loads on ice coating transmission line systems are also presented. The time histories of wind speed acting on transmission line systems are simulated with the harmony superposition method. Finally, the responses of ice coating transmission line systems under different thickness of ice and different wind velocity are discussed. The {{results show that the}} displacement and unbalanced tension increase rapidly with the thickness of ice and wind velocity increasing. The value of the unbalanced tension increases significantly when the ice coating on conductors is nonuniform...|$|R
5000|$|The church {{consists}} of a gothic style choirtower from the 15th century at its eastern end, with a classical style nave from the 18th century at its western end. Originally, the upper portion of the tower employed half-timbered construction, but was rebuilt with stone in 1830 due to severe structural deterioration. The southern face of the choirtower features a mechanical clock, that was added in the 20th century. In terms of materials, the building is constructed of solid masonry with uncoursed random rubble walls. The stone of the tower is exposed, while the nave is finished with a parge <b>coat.</b> The <b>tower</b> has a pyramidal hipped roof topped with a rooster shaped weather vane, while the nave has a combination of gable and hipped roofs, all with squared terra cotta tiles.|$|R
50|$|Loma Alto de la Bandera is a {{mountain}} in the Dominican Republic located within Valle Nuevo National Park, {{which is in the}} province of La Vega Province. During the United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916-24), the mountain was mapped, catalogued, and measured to a height of 9324 ft. (2842 m), with a prominence of 4961 ft. (1512m). Due to the peak's relative proximity to Santo Domingo, the mountaintop is <b>coated</b> with telecommunications <b>towers,</b> including those used for air traffic control at Las Américas International Airport.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Transmission tower-line {{systems with}} {{different}} elevations in mountainous areas are established in this paper. The change curve of ice increasing with time was given {{according to the}} data of ice record. Considering the influences of height difference, ice increasing, plastic analysis of transmission tower is carried out. It can be concluded that the ultimate bearing capacities of ice <b>coating</b> of the <b>tower</b> is significantly influenced by the elevation of the towers beside it. It also can be concluded that the ultimate bearing capacity of ice coating can be improved only when the section of weakness member is increased...|$|R
50|$|Cluj's {{traditional}} coat of {{arms and}} seal was first awarded in 1377 by king Louis I of Hungary. It represents three towers, a city wall with a gate in silver on a blue background. It was the {{coat of arms}} of Cluj until communist rulers modified it introducing other elements but preserving the three towers in the bottom field. The three <b>towers</b> <b>coat</b> of arms was abandoned by nationalist mayor Gheorghe Funar, in a move which did not respect the respective Romanian law. As of 2009 the subsequent mayors of Cluj-Napoca failed to reintroduce the traditional coat of arms as demanded by many heraldists, historians and civil activists.|$|R
40|$|The {{costs of}} {{damage caused by}} scale and {{corrosion}} worldwide in cooling towers, boilers and pipes escalated to more than an annual $ 100 billion in recent years. Neither classical chemical prevention methods nor new alternative electromagnetic water treatment methods have yielded satisfying solutions. We have used a combination of chemical and electromagnetic technologies to prevent scale and corrosion of galvanized zinc <b>coated</b> cooling <b>towers</b> with great success {{in the last three}} years. This manuscript describes the physicochemical principles of the approach we employed. Zinc surfaces were coated with the diaminosilane reagent. This increased a positive charge of the zinc surface and significantly reduced adsorption of calcium cations. Silane coating also protected zinc from corrosion. It was also found that electromagnetic water treatment splits water into atomic hydrogen and hydroxyl ions and acts as a water clusters structure breaker. This prevented buildup of silicate or carbonate scale by increasing the diffusivity of water and ions. When high quantities of calcium and hydrogencarbonate were present, small amounts of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide polymeric descalant were added to cooling tower water to prevent calcium carbonate scale buildup through modification of crystal growth. Such synergistic use of chemical and electromagnetic water treatment resulted in no corrosion or scale buildup after three years of plant studies in twenty cooling towers in California...|$|R
40|$|The {{tower is}} located on a {{promontory}} on the south-western Gulf of Cagliari, near to the Coltellazzo island and the archaeological Punic-Roman of Nora. The first military settlement was probably present {{since the beginning of}} the fourteenth century. Surely the tower was active since 1607. Jorge Aleo (1680) mentions, calling Fortalleza Coltellaz. In the eighteenth century the building was engulfed in a fort, built in a period of six years (1722 - 1728) by engineer the Piedmont Antonio Felix de Vincenti. Later (in the nineteenth century) further work was carried out until the tower became a lighthouse. The tower was considered a tower de armas or vigorous, or for heavy defense, with a garrison of men under a commander. Being a watch tower, is in sight of the towers of Cala d'Ostia, San Macario and the Diavolo. The tower has a structure of a truncated cone, with a height of about 11 meters high and 12 meters in diameter at the base. Inside it has a double ribbed vaulted dome, supported by a central pillar. The aim of this research is were studying mortars and geomaterials used of the ashlars, for define: i) composition of ancient mortars with ratio binder/aggregate; ii) provenance of the raw materials used in the mixture of mortars; iii) alteration processes in progress on mortars and on geomaterials used in masonry. Through the analysis of the physical-mechanical properties, important evidences of chemical and physical decay were highlighted in the mortar of the plasters <b>coating</b> the <b>tower</b> and also in bedding mortars of ashlars of masonry. In some areas, where they are concentrated processes of physical disintegration, also as a result of dissolution of the carbonate matrix of the mortar, show scarce resistance physical-mechanical with consequent detachment from the masonry...|$|R
40|$|A {{cooling tower}} is a heat removal device, which {{extracts}} waste heat {{to the atmosphere}} through the cooling of a water stream to a lower temperature. Cooling towers are frequently associated with biofilm problems and Legionnaires disease outbreaks. Where biofilms can cause clogging and corrosion, reduction of biofilms is important for operational reasons and public health. Therefore, effective anti-biofilm strategies are needed in practice. The aim {{of the present study}} was to reduce biofilm formation using a nano-hydrophobic <b>coating</b> on cooling <b>tower</b> fill materials – polypropylene cooling tower fill material was coated with nano-silica. The effectiveness of the hydrophobic coating was investigated for a 6 -month test period in a model cooling tower system, by monthly counting of the surface-associated bacteria using an epifluorescence microscope. A significant reduction (up to 4 log) in surface-associated bacteria was observed on coated test samples in comparison to uncoated control coupons. This study is the first report regarding the use of nano-silica coatings on cooling <b>tower</b> fills. The <b>coating</b> can be easily fabricated and the range of possible applications can be expanded to include a variety of conditions...|$|R
