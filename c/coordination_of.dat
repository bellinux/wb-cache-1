40|$|The {{structural}} {{diversity of}} arsenic sulfide molecules in compositions between As 4 S 6 and As 4 was investigated using ab initio quantum chemical calculations. The As 4 S 6 molecule {{consists of four}} trigonal pyramid <b>coordinations</b> <b>of</b> As atoms bonding to three S atoms. In the As 4 S 5 composition, only one type of molecular configuration corresponds to an uzonite-type molecule. In the As 4 S 4 composition, two molecular configurations exist with realgar-type and pararealgar-type molecules. Three molecular configurations are in the As 4 S 3 composition. The first configuration comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom <b>coordinations</b> <b>of</b> two types: bonding to two S atoms and one As atom, and bonding to one S atom and two As atoms. The second is the molecular configuration of dimorphite. The third comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom <b>coordinations</b> <b>of</b> two types: bonding to three As atoms, and bonding to one As atom and two S atoms. The As 4 S 2 composition allows molecular configurations of two types. One is comprised of trigonal pyramidal As atom configurations of one type bonding to two As atoms and one S atom. The other comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom <b>coordinations</b> <b>of</b> three types: bonding to two S atoms and one As atoms, bonding to one S atom and two As atoms, and bonding to three As atoms. The As 4 S molecule has trigonal pyramidal As atom <b>coordinations</b> <b>of</b> two types: bonding to one S atom and two As atoms, and bonding to three As atoms. The As 4 S composition permits only one molecular configuration, {{which suggests that the}} mineral duranusite comprises the As 4 S molecular geometry.

40|$|This study {{observes the}} {{structures}} <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> used in Insurance Policy. The structure <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> {{is the only}} structure in English which has more than two immediate constituents: clearly, a series has as many immediate constituents as there are items in the series. This refers to the sentences in the Insurance Policy, which are constructed in very long and complex sentences. This thesis aims at finding out the construction <b>of</b> structures <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> in Erection All Risks Policy. Therefore, the writer analyzed the structure <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> based on Nelson Francis' theory. A structure <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> consists <b>of</b> two or more syntactically equivalent units joined in a structure which functions as a single unit. The units so joined may be any of the parts of speech or more complex structures. The joining is accomplished by coordinators and punctuation marks in written form. The coordinators could be either present or not. The other supported theories are Sidney Greebaum and Randolph Quirk in coordination (1990); Enno Klamer in the components and punctuation (1977); and John E. Warriner in punctuation (1982). The details of the theories are to be discussed in chapter 11. The writer uses qualitative approach to analyze the structures <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> in the sentences of Insurance Policy. The approaches {{of this study are}} the kinds <b>of</b> structures <b>of</b> <b>coordination,</b> the components <b>of</b> the structures <b>of</b> <b>coordination,</b> the linkers <b>of</b> the structures <b>of</b> <b>coordination,</b> the syntactic functions of the structures <b>of</b> <b>coordination,</b> and to count their occurrence used in the Insurance Policy. From this study, it is found out that there are four types of' structure <b>of</b> <b>coordination.</b> They are common and syndetic, series and asyndetic (with comma); series and asyndetic (with semicolon); then series and poiysyndetic (without comma). The components <b>of</b> structures <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> arc parts <b>of</b> speech (noun, verb, adjective, and adverb), phrases (noun phrase, verb phrase, and prepositional phrase), and clauses (independent and subordination clause). The linkers <b>of</b> structures <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> are coordinating conjunction anti, or, but, {{and with the help of}} punctuation marks comma and semicolon. The syntactic functions of the structures <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> function as subject, predicate, main verb (part of predicate), direct object, objective complement, object of preposition, head, and modifier.
