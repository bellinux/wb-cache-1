State media reports said the hospital was treating 55 survivors, including nine in serious condition. At least 70 people, and possibly more than 120 people {{were reported to have}} been injured. According to BBC News, people who survived the blaze were searching hospitals for missing family and friends. As of 24 November, 66 wounded people, 14 of which were in critical <b>condition,</b> <b>were</b> being treated at seven area medical centers. In all, nine hospitals received victims of the fire.|$|E
5|$|At its {{session of}} 23 November 2006, the {{planning}} {{committee of the}} city council charged its staff with examining how the Altes Stadthaus could be used for large-scale retail without damaging it as an architectural landmark. The report, which was presented at the end of December, recommended reuse of the already modified internal space housing the library, and creation of additional usable space up to a total of approximately 1600m². This could be done by lowering the floor to street level and modifying stairway areas without changing the external appearance of the building, which is characteristic of government buildings of the 1920s, particularly in its blocky ground floor. Changes to the upper floors, which remained largely in their original <b>condition,</b> <b>were</b> not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is {{not common}} in the breed, although it occurs sufficiently often for many breeders to have their breeding stock tested. The Cattle Dog {{has a number of}} inherited conditions, but most of these are not common. Hereditary polioencephalomyelopathy of the Australian Cattle Dog is a very rare condition caused by an inherited biochemical defect. Dogs identified with the <b>condition</b> <b>were</b> completely paralysed within their first year. Based on a sample of 69 still-living dogs, the most common health issues noted by owners were musculoskeletal (spondylosis, elbow dysplasia, and arthritis) and reproductive (pyometra, infertility, and false pregnancy), and blindness. A study of dogs diagnosed at Veterinary Colleges in the United States and Canada over a thirty-year period described fractures, lameness and cruciate ligament tears as the most common conditions in the Australian Cattle Dogs treated.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a state of}} the art of path choice and traffic {{assignment}} models in road emergency <b>conditions</b> <b>is</b> reported. The approaches proposed in literature are classified, distinguishing two approaches for path choice and three approaches for traffic assignment (static, pseudo dynamic and dynamic). In literature, several applications of models in emergency <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> available: at the beginning models specified in ordinary <b>conditions</b> <b>were</b> applied in emergency conditions. Afterwards, a first generation of models specified in emergency <b>conditions</b> <b>was</b> proposed. After 9 / 11 and Katrina Hurricane a second generation of emergency <b>conditions</b> models <b>was</b> specified. Evolution of models applied in emergency <b>conditions</b> <b>is</b> presented in this paper: first, models in ordinary <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> treated; second, models in emergency <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> treated. In the last ten years several applications of models in emergency <b>conditions</b> have <b>been</b> carried out.

5|$|King George V {{had four}} sets of Parsons geared {{turbines}}. Two main turbines were arranged in series and drove a shaft through double helical gears. An astern turbine was incorporated in the exhaust casing of the low-pressure turbine, and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the high-pressure turbine. A speed of 28.5 knots was expected at standard displacement and 27.5 knots at full-load displacement on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload <b>condition</b> <b>were</b> 29.25 and 28.25 knots respectively. The turbine unit was a low-speed type (2,257 rpm) coupled to a single reduction gear which produced 236 rpm at the propeller shaft.|$|E
5|$|With the Observer Corps {{passing a}} steady stream of reports {{regarding}} approaching German formations they soon realised a coordinated attack was under way. The two Squadrons approaching the high-altitude attack could not be diverted and no fighters had been asked to engage the 9 Staffel. The only Squadron {{on the ground in the}} area was No. 111 Squadron RAF that had 12 Hurricanes at RAF Croydon. Although usually the responsibility of Park, the controllers took the matter into their own hands and ordered all aircraft into the air. Even those that were not in combat <b>condition</b> <b>were</b> flown north-east, to avoid them being caught on the ground.|$|E

25|$|Some heavy armored {{fighting}} {{vehicles were}} obtained, notably British Cromwell tanks (150 {{provided by the}} United Kingdom) and captured German tanks (44, of which 12 were Panthers). The 12th Regiment of Dragoons received 12 Cavalier tanks among other British equipment in April 1945. In other cases, FFI units used vehicles no longer favored by Allied forces, such as the U.S. M6 Fargo, a light truck with a portee 37mm antitank gun.

25|$|The {{emergency}} {{detection system}} (EDS) sensed initial development of {{conditions in the}} flight vehicle during the boost phases of flight which could cause vehicle failure. The EDS reacted to these emergency situations {{in one of two}} ways. If breakup of the vehicle were imminent, an automatic abort sequence would be initiated. If, however, the emergency <b>condition</b> <b>were</b> developing slowly enough or were of such a nature that the flight crew can evaluate it and take action, only visual indications were provided to the flight crew. Once an abort sequence had been initiated, either automatically or manually, it was irrevocable and ran to completion.|$|E

The worst subway station overall, in terms of crime and its condition, was Grand Central–42nd Street, while the worst elevated station was Metropolitan Avenue in Queens. The subway cars in the worst <b>condition</b> <b>were</b> the R10s. The subway line with the worst signals was the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, so the signals were upgraded in the 1980s. The track in the worst shape was that of the BMT Sea Beach Line, which had {{more or less the same}} infrastructure as when it opened in 1915.|$|E

25|$|Giuseppe da Salvo, {{the pilot}} of the {{helicopter}} {{who was the first}} to notice the inflatable boat with survivors and the 21 deceased victims on board, expressed his surprise when learning that three fire extinguishers in good <b>condition</b> <b>were</b> found on the boat. He departed from Durrës at 21:00 when the wind's speed reached , while flying a helicopter would normally be prohibited. After flying for two hours over the presumed location of the vessel on the Ionian sea, he turned back without finding the target. The next morning the boat was located. Meanwhile, the survivors deny the existence of any fire extinguishers on board.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} for Irwin was to {{determine}} if transsaccadic memory is tied to spatial position. He performed experiments using dot patterns and later, performed the same type of experiment alongside McConkie in his effort to prove the saccade target hypothesis. In those experiments, the researchers used a picture instead of dot patterns. Participants in the experimental <b>condition</b> <b>were</b> given an initial eye position, followed by a saccade target position on the picture. Unlike Irwin’s first experiment, where the pattern did not change spatial location during the saccade, the picture underwent one of three shift conditions: All shift down, target object shift down, or background shift up. Detection of change ended up being much higher when only the target object moved compared to when the entire image shifted. This demonstrated the importance of the target object in detection of image displacements.|$|E
25|$|Lau et al. {{set up an}} {{experiment}} where subjects would look at an analogue-style clock, and a red dot would move around the screen. Subjects were told to click the mouse button whenever they felt the intention to do so. One group was given a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse, {{and the other was}} given a sham TMS. Subjects in the intention <b>condition</b> <b>were</b> told to move the cursor to where it was when they felt the inclination to press the button. In the movement condition, subjects moved their cursor to where it was when they physically pressed the button. Results showed the TMS was able to shift the perceived intention forward by 16ms, and shifted back the 14ms for the movement condition. Perceived intention could be manipulated up to 200ms after the execution of the spontaneous action, indicating that the perception of intention occurred after the executive motor movements. Often it is thought that free will were to exist, it would require intention to be the causal source of behavior. These results show that intention may not be the causal source of all behavior.|$|E
