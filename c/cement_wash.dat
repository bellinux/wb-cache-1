40|$|Introduction When {{drilling}} an oil well, {{the well}} is lined by sinking a steel casing, or liner, into the drilling mud (see Figure 1). The {{inside of the}} liner forms a central pipe, and leaves an annular gap between {{the outside of the}} liner and the surrounding rock. The inside and outside of the liner are initially filled with drilling mud, which is displaced by pumping a sequence of fluids down inside the liner from the surface. Typically, a chemical wash is pumped down first, followed by a spacer, and finally a <b>cement</b> slurry. The <b>wash,</b> which is usually water based, is less dense than the spacer, a water-based suspension, which is itself less dense than the cement slurry. The scenario of a light wash being forced down a pipe by a denser spacer fluid is liable to instabilities of Rayleigh [...] Taylor type. The two fluids are miscible, so mixing between the wash and the spacer is likely to take place. This may impair the intended efficiency of the wash in displacing mud from the wall...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Fuji VII, Fuji IX, Riva Pink, Riva Bleach, Ketac Fil and Fuji IX Extra were investigated. The fluoride-containing materials used were tooth paste and mouth wash (Colgate). Specimens of each material (n= 15) were immersed separately in deionized water for 59 days. Then the samples of each material were divided into three groups of five each. Two groups were recharged for 2, 20 and 60 min daily during three consecutive weekly intervals and then no treatment for one week. The third group was used as control. Fluoride release measurements (μg/cm 2 /day) were made in every 24 h. One-way and repeated measures analysis of variance tests were used. Results: Tooth paste recharged materials showed higher level of recharge. On day 1, the difference of fluoride release from different treatment groups of different materials except for Fuji IX Extra were not significant (P> 0. 05). On days 7 and 14, the differences observed were significant (P< 0. 05) for all materials except for Fuji VII (tooth paste versus mouth wash) and Trial Fuji IX (mouth wash versus control) and on day 14 for Rvia Pink (mouth wash versus control). On days 21 and 28, the differences observed were significant for all the materials (P< 0. 05) except for Riva Pink (toothpaste versus mouth wash), Riva Bleach, Ketac Fil and Trial FujiI X (mouth wash versus control) on day 28.

40|$|The {{shortage}} {{of water in}} Palestine and public concerns {{about the quality of}} groundwater resources have led to awareness that a national wastewater management and reclamation program should be developed and implemented. Unused reclaimed water is a wasted water resource. Impaired effluent quality is among major challenges behind lack of successful large scale effluent reuse schemes in Palestine, exacerbated by institutional and socio-political issues. This paper presents the local experience gained from the construction and operation of the first urban membrane bioreactor (MBR) in Alteereh suburb of Ramallah city, the first advanced domestic wastewater treatment facility in Palestine. The MBR facility is designed to serve 25000 capita with a current daily average flow rate of 1500 m 3. The start-up phase of the MBR facility, during November 2014, faced two major operational challenges considering wastewater characteristics; an illicit discharge of petroleum and olive mill wastewater. Despite the challenges faced exacerbated by the severe cold winter conditions prevailed, the process performance of the MBR facility was stable.

40|$|AbstractMany {{countries}} {{consider the}} fly ash produced from the incineration of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) as hazardous waste. In Taiwan, 24. 5 thousand tons of MSW is incinerated and 554. 7 tons of fly ash is produced daily. As landfill capacity {{in the country is}} limited, this vast amount of fly ash should ideally be reused. However, some treatment methods to enable the reuse of fly ash can have a worse impact on the environment than was previously believed. The aim of this research was therefore to compare the different processes for the reuse of fly ash by employing data collected from the incineration process in Taiwan in order to establish a life-cycle assessment (LCA) database. The database, containing information on the assessment of reuse treatments, is intended to inform decision making on the best practices for the reuse of fly ash. The study poses four scenarios for reuse treatment and disposal of one ton of fly ash: 1) landfilling after solidification, 2) reuse as <b>cement</b> after a <b>washing</b> process, 3) reuse as bricks after a washing process, 4) reuse as an alkali in the waelz process of steelmaking. The results from the LCA showed that the washing processes consumed more water but less electricity; however, more electricity was consumed and higher toxicity was caused in scenario 4, the reuse as an alkali in the waelz process. More water and chemical additives were used in scenario 2 because of the higher limits of chloride compounds and heavy metals used in construction materials. To conclude, the comprehensive LCA inventory database established by this study could assist in reducing the environmental impacts of reuse treatments for fly ash, and consequently could contribute to the safer management of fly ash worldwide...|$|R
40|$|The {{document}} attached {{has been}} archived {{with permission from}} the Australian Dental Association. An external link to the publisher’s copy is included. Background: Diamine silver fluoride (Ag(NH 3) 2 F), referred to as AgF, {{has been shown to}} reduce the incidence of caries in primary dentitions. The clinical application of this material has been limited by staining associated with both teeth and restorative materials. The application of potassium iodide (KI) after AgF eliminates stain formation. There is a lack of information as to how the addition of AgF followed by KI may affect the bond strength to dentine. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the bond strengths of auto cure glass ionomer cement to dentine surfaces that had been treated with AgF and KI and without treatment. Methods: Ten recently extracted human third molars were embedded into methyl methacrylate resin and sliced to form a square block of exposed dentine surfaces. Each of the four surfaces were treated by one of the following procedures: (a) etching with 37 per cent phosphoric acid; (b) applying GC dentine conditioner; (c) etching, followed by application of AgF/KI then washing off the precipitate and air drying; and (d) etching, applying AgF/KI and air drying the reaction products on the surface. Fuji VII auto cure glass ionomer cement was bonded onto each sample and fracture tested. Results: The dentine samples treated with AgF/KI followed by washing away the precipitate and air drying had bond strengths (2. 83 MPa) not significantly different from samples that had been conditioned (2. 40 MPa). Samples where the AgF/KI precipitate had been air dried onto the dentine surface had significantly lower bond strengths (1. 49 MPa) than the washed samples. Samples that were etched had significantly lower bond strengths (1. 91 MPa) than the conditioned samples. Conclusions: This study found that the application of AgF/KI to etched dentine samples followed by washing off the precipitate, created bond strengths that were not significantly different to conditioned samples. Leaving the AgF/KI precipitate on the dentine surface significantly reduced the bond strength of auto cured glass ionomer <b>cement</b> to dentine. <b>Washing</b> away the reaction products and air drying is recommended as the clinical protocol for using AgF and KI on dentine surfaces prior to application of an auto cure glass ionomer cement.

40|$|Abstract only. - In Hong Kong, huge {{quantities}} of construction and demolition (C&D) wastes (57, 000 tonper- day) are produced representing the largest {{fraction of the}} total solid waste stream. The disposal of the wastes has become a severe social and environmental problem in the territory. Government sources have indicated that there are acute shortages of both public filling areas (reclamation sites) and landfill space in Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s three mega landfills are expected to be full within 5 - 6 years’ time. The possibility of reducing and recycling these wastes is thus of prime importance. The Hong Kong Polytechnic University has been conducting research on methods to recycle construction waste. The potential applications of the recycled materials are in road pavements, concrete, concrete blocks and mortars. Some of the developed techniques have been commercially utilized in industry. This presentation summarizes the major findings of the research conducted, and introduces some case studies on utilizing accelerated carbonation technique to enhance the properties of recycled aggregate concrete In recent years, adopting the accelerated carbonation technique {{to improve the quality of}} recycled concrete wastes as well as to capture and store CO 2 has been investigated by a number of researchers including our group at PolyU. The potential CO 2 capture ability of recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) was related to the carbonation conditions and the characteristics of RCAs. It was found that a moderate relative humidity, a CO 2 concentration higher than 10 %, a slight positive pressure or a gas flow rate of > 5 L/min were optimal to accelerate the RCAs carbonation. The properties of RCAs were improved after the carbonation treatment. The reduction of water absorption was up to 16. 7 %. There was about 4. 0 % increase of 10 % fine value and a 26 % reduction of crushing value. This resulted in performance enhancement of the new concrete prepared with the carbonated RCAs, especially an obvious increase of the mechanical strengths and an even more significant improvement of durability properties. In addition, the replacement percentage of natural aggregates by the carbonated RCAs can be increased to 60 % with an insignificant reduction in the mechanical properties of the new concrete. Additionally, the potential utilization of fresh concrete slurry waste (CSW), which is sourced from dewatered solid <b>cement</b> residues after <b>washing</b> out over-ordered/rejected fresh concrete and concrete trucks in concrete batching plants, has been investigated. Due to its rich calcium-silicate content and cementitious feature, it was considered as a cementitious paste as well as a CO 2 capture medium to produce new products. Subjecting to accelerated carbonation, rapid initial strength development and lower drying shrinkage for the prepared concrete mixture were achieved. Moreover, the production of the concrete mixtures for partition wall blocks using the developed technique can be considered as carbon neutral...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{increased}} sediment exposure on coastal marine ecosystems {{is one of}} the most important contemporary environmental issues. Sediment exposure is defined as the concentrations of sediment particles suspended in the water column and the amount of sediment depositing on the seabed. In addition to natural events, such as land erosion, rainfall, and tidal currents, anthropogenic activities such as land use, road building, logging, mining, port maintenance and dredging, contribute to the discharge of a great amount of sediment in the water column. As sessile suspension-feeder assemblages play a critical role in marine ecosystems through their active transfers of organic and inorganic between the water column and the seabed (i. e. benthic-pelagic coupling), increased sediment exposure generated by anthropogenic activities may negatively impact these organisms. This study set out to evaluate the influence of increased sediment exposure on suspension-feeder assemblages in a temperate seagrass habitat. Most of the research was conducted within Posidonia sinuosa meadows near Woodman Point (32 ◦ 7 ’S, 115 ◦ 44 ’E), south of Fremantle, Western Australia. At this location, persistent sediment plumes from a <b>cement</b> manufacturer’s <b>wash</b> plant provided an opportunity to study the mechanisms through which increased sediment exposure can affect suspension feeder assemblages. This study was examining: the relationship between sediment exposure and suspension feeder assemblage composition; the influence of increased sediment exposure on the contribution of potential food sources to suspension feeder diets; and the influence of sediment exposure on suspension-feeding mechanisms (filtration and retention rates) and strategies (food particle selection). The descriptive work, presented in Chapter 1, revealed a strong gradient in sediment exposure with decreasing sediment deposition with distance from the wash plant. There was little dissimilarity, in term of species diversity and biomass, among suspension-feeder assemblages under high sediment exposure and those experiencing natural sedimentation regimes. These findings indicated that the suspension-feeder assemblages at the study site were resistant to high sediment exposure and that some species could potentially display compensatory mechanisms. Thus, the degree to which increased sediment exposure influences suspension feeders was more likely to be species specific and depend on the resilience of their feeding mechanisms and strategies. Those findings underlined the need to test the causal parameters underlying responses to suspension-feeding activity and selectivity due to increased sediment exposure. Results presented in Chapter 2 indicated that the three most conspicuous suspension feeder in term of biomass and abundances presented distinct isotopic signatures, implying dissimilarities in their diets. Differences in δ 13 C and δ 15 N can be explained by consumption of different types of picoplanktonic particles and the degree to which sedimentary organic matter contributed to their diets. Increased sediment exposure had no influence on the natural diets of the ascidian Herdmania momus and the bivalve Pinna bicolor. For the sponge Tethya sp, the contribution of sedimentary organic matter to its diet increased at sites with high sediment exposure, suggesting a potential benefit to its diet. Overall, the influence of sediment exposure on suspension feeder diets was species specific and dependent on the nature (e. g. organically rich versus organically depleted) and concentrations of the sediment. In Chapter 3 data are presented to show that feeding mechanisms and strategies of three species of suspension feeders best representing the benthic assemblages were influenced by sediment exposure. Under high sediment exposure, the ascidian Herdmania momus had lower pumping rates, but maintained a relatively constant food retention rate, and optimised its food intake by expanding its food sources from mainly cyanobacteria (Synechococcus) to a wider range of food sources. The bivalve Pinna bicolor also had lower filtration activity with high sediment exposure, again, maintaining relatively constant total retention rates and displaying a change in particle selection from bacteria and Synechococcus to larger picoeukaryotic cells of higher carbon content. The sponge Tethya sp. appeared to benefit from elevated sediment concentrations, as filtration and retention rates increased, potentially related to a lack of food selectivity. In Chapter 4, a short-term laboratory experiment was combined with a field transplant experiment to investigate the response of suspension feeders to increased sediment exposure. Under elevated sediment exposure, Herdmania momus and Pinna bicolor modulated their particle selection to optimise food intake, while the non-selective suspension feeder Tethya sp increased its particle retention rate and efficiency. Both the laboratory and transplant experiment findings corroborated observations made in Chapters 1 and 2; compensatory adaptations associated with the feeding activity, such as the modulation of pumping rates and the optimisation of food intake by particle selection, help to explain the potential resistance of suspension feeder community structure to high sediment exposure. A major outcome of this research is that it informs shallow coastal ecosystems stakeholders of the possible consequences of anthropogenic activities that increase sediment exposure, particularly those in the order of TSS at 40 mg·l- 1 and deposition rates in the order of 10 g·cm- 2 ·month- 1. Despite this magnitude of sediment exposure had little influence on suspension feeder assemblage composition, the effects on the suspension-feeding function, including the increase of the filtration activity and transfers of carbon to the benthos, potentially influence benthicpelagic coupling and other ecosystem-scale processes. Given the variation in sensitivity to sediment exposure among suspension feeder species, meaningful criteria to limit the effects of anthropogenic sediment loading on shallow coastal ecosystems should take into account the whole species assemblage present at any given site...|$|R
