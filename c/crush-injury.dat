40|$|Background: The {{electrophysiologic}} and antiarrhythmic {{effects of}} a new class III antiar-rhythmic drug (KCB- 328), a delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) blocker with minimal reverse use-dependent effect on atrial repolarization, were evaluated in the canine night atri-al <b>crush-injury</b> model of atrial flutter (AFL). Methods: Ten anesthetized, open-chest dogs, were studied after right atrial <b>crush-injury.</b> Atrial effective refractory period (ERP), conduction velocity (CV), wavelength, and disper-sion of refractoriness were determined during programmed stimulation (S 1 S 2 at SISI = 200, 300, 400, and 500 msec) at four sites via a mapping plaque sutured on the right atrial free wall. Right and left ventricular ERP were similarly measured at single sites. Electro-physiological parameters were determined at baseline and following sequential cumulative doses of KCB- 328 (10, 30, 100. and 300,ug/kg). Results: Sustained AFL was inducible in 7 / 10 dogs by rapid pacing following baseline elec-trophysiologic measurements. KCB- 328 significantly prolonged sinus cycle length, but {{had no effect on}} PR interval, and prolonged QTc only at the highest dose level. KCB- 328 signif-icantly prolonged atrial ERP and wavelength and ventricular ERP, and significantly reduce...|$|E
40|$|The glycosaminoglycans of sciatic nerves {{recovering}} from <b>crush-injury</b> were studied in adult guinea pigs and {{compared with those}} of non-injured mature neural tissues. The glycosaminoglycans were recovered from the 1, 900 g supernatant and pellet of the tissue homogenates and assayed for hexuronate contents and susceptibilities to hyaluronidase, chondroitinase ABC, and nitrous acid. In the normal brain and central nerve tracts, the glycosoaminoglycans were distributed both in the supernatant and pellet fractions; the brain showed a predominance of chondroitin sulphates but the tracts showed a predominance of heparan sulphates. Twice as much glycosaminoglycans were found in normal sciatic nerves, only in the pellet fraction and with heparan sulphate predominant. In the 2 weeks post-crush, progressive increase in hexuronate was observed, due mainly to additional chondroitin sulphate forms in the supernatant; the pellet fraction in the same period was however similar to the untreated controls in relative abundance of glycosaminoglycan classes and hexuronate content. At 4 weeks post-crush, although the total hexuronate returned to the control level, a significant proportion of glycosaminoglycans remained in the supernatant fraction. Evidence is thus provided for the need to modulate the glycosaminoglycan expression pattern in adult neural tissue to allow post- traumatic tissue remodelling and axonal regrowth. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|NMDA receptors are glutamate-gated ion {{channels}} that are permeable to Ca 2 +. NMDA receptors are tetramers formed {{by a combination}} of subunits. In the present thesis, we describe the novel NR 3 B subunit that we cloned in mouse and human. NR 3 B was found to be expressed in the adult rat and human central nervous system (CNS). Also, human NR 3 A was cloned and it's expression in the adult human CNS was investigated. In addition, we identified, cloned, and characterized tissue expression of a previously unknown gene, which we named membralin because it contains several transmembrane regions. Notably, the genes that encode membralin and NR 3 B were found to be oriented in an anti-parallel fashion, both in the mouse and the human genomes. Excessive Ca 2 + influx through NMDA receptors is a major mechanism for neurodegeneration following stroke and brain trauma. To better understand the mechanisms behind NMDA-dependent neurodegeneration, we used, developed, and characterized three injury models in the rat: crush injury in entorhinal hippocampal slices, global ischemia, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Temporal and regional patterns of cell death were evaluated in these models with focus on delayed cell death. <b>Crush-injury</b> in slices induced two phases of cell death, including an early phase that peaked within a day after injury and a delayed phase that appeared at 4 DAI. Treatment with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK- 801 (30 ìM) for 2 h {{at the time of the}} injury prevented the delayed but not the early phase of cell death. Also, we analyzed the inflammatory response at various time-points after <b>crush-injury.</b> Two complement components: C 1 q and C 5 b- 9 and the complement inhibitor clusterin were dramatically up-regulated after injury. These studies indicate that delayed cell death in this model is dependent on NMDA receptor activation and that the complement cascade can be activated in vitro, without the influence of exogenous blood products and cells. A new reproducible global ischemia model was developed. Eleven min of global ischemia induced delayed cell death of CA 1 neurons in the hippocampus, as shown by Fluoro-Jade, cresyl-violet and NeuN staining. The death of CA 1 neurons was correlated to deficiencies in learning and memory, as analyzed using the Morris water maze and a novel water T-maze. At 90 days after ischemia, new CA 1 neurons had formed, associated with a marked recovery in learning and memory. At 250 days after ischemia, the ischemia-induced new neurons were found to degenerate in association with the appearance of Ca 2 + deposits, but without significant attenuation of learning and memory performance. In a model of subarachoidal hemorrhage, we demonstrated delayed nerve cell death in CA 1 and CA 3, and found the extent of cell death to relate to the severity of the transient ischemia. We found that the delayed nerve cell death in both the global ischemia model and in the subarachnoid hemorrhage model was preceded by down regulation of specific NMDA receptor subunits, with somewhat different profiles in the two models. Also the total number of NMDA receptors was found to be decreased using [3 H]MK- 801 autoradiography. These studies may give a better understanding of the role of NMDA receptors in delayed neurodegeneration, and provide a basis for the development of new neuroprotective treatments...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction. Erectile {{dysfunction}} (ED) {{remains a}} major complication after radical prostatectomy. The use of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) has shown promising {{results for the}} treatment of ED. However, the mechanisms of action for stem cell therapy remain controversial, with increasing evidence pointing to paracrine pathways. Aim. To determine the effects and to identify the mechanism of action of ADSC and ADSC-derived lysate in a rat model of cavernous nerve (CN) crush injury. Methods. Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four equal groups: one group underwent sham operation, while three groups underwent bilateral CN crush. <b>Crush-injury</b> groups were treated at the time of injury with intracavernous injection of ADSC, lysate, or vehicle only (injured controls). Erectile function was assessed by CN electrostimulation at 4 weeks. Penile tissue was collected for histology. Main Outcome Measures. Intracavernous pressure increase upon CN stimulation; neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) content in the dorsal penile nerve; smooth muscle content, collagen content, and number of apoptotic cells in the corpus cavernosum. Results. Both ADSC and lysate treatments resulted in significant recovery of erectile function, as compared with vehicle treatment. nNOS content was preserved in both the ADSC and lysate group, with significantly higher expression compared with vehicle-treated animals. There was significantly less fibrosis and a significant preservation of smooth muscle content in the ADSC and lysate groups compared with injured controls. The observed functional improvement after lysate injection supports the hypothesis that ADSCs act through release of intracellular preformed substances or by active secretion of certain biomolecules. The underlying mechanism of recovery appears to involve neuron preservation and cytoprotection by inhibition of apoptosis. Conclusions. Penile injection of both ADSC and ADSC-derived lysate can improve recovery of erectile function in a rat model of neurogenic ED. Albersen M, Fandel TM, Lin G, Wang G, Banie L, Lin CS, and Lue TF.

40|$|Recent {{studies in}} our canine <b>crush-injury</b> (CI) model of atrial flutter (AFL) suggest that {{elimination}} of {{dispersion of repolarization}} is an important antiarrhythmic effect of newer class 3 antiarrhythmic drugs. However, the effects of class 1 a antiarrhythmic drugs on dispersion of repolarization {{and its relation to}} termination and suppression of AFL have not been studied. Therefore, the effects of quinidine 10) were studied in 8 dogs, using a 56 -electrode plaque placed over the CI to map activation patterns during AFL and its induction and termination, and to measure effective refractory periods (ERP) at all 56 electrodes and conduction velocity (CV) parallel to the CI, before and after 0 (10 mg/kg over 10 min, then 3 mg/kg/hr). ResultsInduction of AFL at baseline was due to unidirectional block below the CI. a terminated AFL in only 3 dogs, due to conduction block below the CI, occurring either abruptly or following premature eccentric activation of the reentry circuit. Sustained AFL was reinducible after a in 5 dogs, and nonsustained AFL in 3. Mean overall ERP increased 14 % from 112 ± 11 msec at baseline to 128 ± 15 msec after a (p< 0. 001). ERP was longer below CI than above (115 ± 10 ms vs 109 ± 10 ms, p< 0. 001). and this difference was not eliminated by a (133 ± 14 ms vs 123 ± 14 ms, p< 0. 001). Overall dispersion of ERP (9. 9 ± 2. 3 msec) was unchanged by a (1 0. 0 ± 1. 3 msec, p=NS). The number of adjacent electrodes with ERP difference ≥ 20 msec (14. 4 ± 10. 4) was also not changed by a (12. 5 ± 7. 9, P = NS). CV was slower below the CI than above at baseline (0. 7 ± 0. 1 vs 0. 9 ± 0. 1 mis,p< 0. 001), and this difference was unchanged by a (0. 6 ± 0. 1 vs 0. 8 ± 0. 1 mis,p< 0. 001). although CV was slowed overall(p< 0. 01). a prolonged AFL cycle length 57 % from 123 ± 12 to 198 ± 37 msec (p< 0. 01). Conclusion 1) Baseline dispersion of ERP and CV is important for initiating and sustaining AFL in this model. 2) The class 1 a drug quinidine is relatively ineffective in terminating and suppressing AFL in this model, because it prolongs ERP less than AFL cycle length and it does not eliminate dispersion of ERP or C...|$|E
