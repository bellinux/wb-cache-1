5|$|Denied {{the use of}} compulsion, Chamberlain had {{to persuade}} Britons to {{volunteer}} for essential war work, and fit young workers to leave the factories and enter the Army. He had to address mass meetings and issue posters. He found that workers were reluctant to exchange the <b>comforts</b> <b>of</b> home and wartime salaries for the uncertainties of the trenches and a wage of one shilling a day. Chamberlain had little confidence in voluntary schemes and they indeed proved unsuccessful, with only 9,000workers freed to be drafted into the Army {{at a time when}} Britain was sustaining huge casualties.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} thirty, Mahavira {{abandoned}} the <b>comforts</b> <b>of</b> royal life and left his home and family to live an ascetic life {{in the pursuit of}} spiritual awakening. He undertook severe austerities of fasting and bodily mortifications, meditated under the Ashoka tree, and discarded his clothes. There is a graphic description of his hardships and humiliation in the Acharanga Sutra. According to the Kalpa Sūtra, Mahavira spent the first forty-two monsoons of his life at Astikagrama, Champapuri, Prstichampa, Vaishali, Vanijagrama, Nalanda, Mithila, Bhadrika, Alabhika, Panitabhumi, Shravasti, and Pawapuri. He is said to have lived in Rajagriha during the rainy season of the forty-first year of his ascetic life. This is traditionally dated to have been in 491BC.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his seventh}} {{season with the}} Athletics, Zito signed a seven-year deal with the Giants in December 2006. At the time, {{it was the largest}} {{contract}} ever given to a pitcher. He posted double-digit wins in his first three seasons, and in 2010 he helped San Francisco win their first championship since 1954. However, he struggled the last month of the season and he was left off the postseason roster. After sitting out much of the 2011 season with a foot and ankle injury, he came back in 2012 and flourished, finishing with a 15–8 record, his best season in a Giants uniform. The same October, Zito helped lead the Giants to their second World Series title in San Francisco history by going 2–0 with a 1.69 ERA in three postseason starts. In his first career World Series start, he outdueled Tigers' ace Justin Verlander in Game 1, setting the stage for San Francisco's sweep to their seventh World Series title in franchise history. Zito struggled in 2013 but received a standing ovation from the fans in his final appearance as a Giant. Following the year, he became a free agent. Zito, a philanthropist, founded Strikeouts For Troops, a national non-profit that provides <b>comforts</b> <b>of</b> home and lifts the spirits and morale of injured troops as well as offering support to military families.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis: to evaluate patients’ who are ill with metastasic tumor of long bones (os longum) and have an X-ray – confirmed diagnose of pathological bone break <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> living. Tasks for the research: 1. To examine patients’ who are ill with metastasic tumor of long bones and have an X-ray – confirmed diagnose of pathological bone break <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> living, singularities of nursing and their change during the term of research. 2. To compare <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> living and singularities of nursing of patients’ who are ill with metastasic tumor of long bones and have an X-ray – confirmed diagnose of pathological bone break {{with those of the}} control group. 3. To determine factors having impact on <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> living and nursing of patients’ who are ill with metastasic tumor of long bones and have an X-ray – confirmed diagnose of pathological bone break. 4. To supply with the recommendations for development of nursing of the patients ill with metastasic tumor of long bones. Exploratory group – patients of Orthopedics and Trauma Clinics at the Kaunas University of Medicine Clinics ill with metastasic tumor of long bones and have an X-ray – confirmed diagnose of pathological bone break. Control group (control) - patients of Orthopedics and Trauma Clinics at the Kaunas University of Medicine Clinics suffering from analogous break of long bone but in absence of metastasic tumor of long bones. Results: After summing the collected data up and analyzing it a conclusion was drawn that the general <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> living of exploratory group made no significant changes. In the acute after-trauma period average <b>of</b> general <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> living was 3, 34 and 5 - 6 months after it was 4, 24.

40|$|Ride <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> road {{vehicles}} {{running on the}} ground has been extensively investigated {{as one of the}} main criteria in the design of {{road vehicles}}. The information on the ride <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> road vehicles running on a long span cable-supported bridge under crosswind is, however, very limited. This paper presents an evaluation <b>of</b> ride <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> road vehicles running on a long span cable-stayed bridge under crosswind. The ride comfort criteria for road vehicles are briefly reviewed first. The principle of mathematical modeling and the equation of motion of a coupled road vehicle-bridge system under crosswind are then introduced. The framework proposed is finally applied to a group of high-sided road vehicles running on a real cable-stayed bridge under crosswind as a case study. Ride <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> the high-sided road vehicle under various conditions of road roughness, vehicle speed, and crosswind speed is investigated for the vehicle running on either the ground or the cable-stayed bridge with and without crosswind. The results show that the crosswind influences the ride <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle in the lateral direction while the bridge motion affects the ride <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle in the vertical direction.

40|$|Longitudinal {{acceleration}} <b>comfort</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the essential}} metrics {{used to evaluate}} the ride <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> train. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effectiveness of using hand grip force as a correlate <b>of</b> longitudinal acceleration <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> rapid transit trains. In the paper, a motion simulation system was set up and a two-stage experiment was designed to investigate the role of the grip force on the longitudinal <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> rapid transit trains. The results of the experiment show that the incremental grip force was linearly correlated with the longitudinal acceleration value, while the incremental grip force had no correlation with the direction of the longitudinal acceleration vector. The results also show that the effects of incremental grip force and acceleration duration on the longitudinal <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> rapid transit trains were significant. Based on multiple regression analysis, a step function model was established to predict the longitudinal <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> rapid transit trains using the incremental grip force and the acceleration duration. The feasibility and practicably of the model was verified by a field test. Furthermore, a comparative analysis shows that the motion simulation system and the grip force based model were valid to support the laboratory studies on the longitudinal <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> rapid transit trains...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluated patients’ expectation and satisfaction with complete dentures before and after the treatment concerning phonetics, chewing, <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> use and aesthetics. Methods. Forty complete edentulous patients rated their expectation before and satisfaction after the treatment based on a questionnaire scores. Patient-related variables regarding age, gender and previous experience (whether worn complete denture or not) were also recorded. Results. Patients’ rating for expectations were higher than the satisfaction after treatment regarding phonetics, chewing, <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> use and aesthetics. A negative significant correlation was shown between the items before and after the treatment rating for phonetics, chewing, <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> use and aesthetics. No statistical correlation was found between all the evaluated aspects’ (i. e. phonetics, chewing, <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> use and aesthetics) of expectation and satisfaction, and age, gender, and previous experience except a weak negative correlation noticed between age and <b>comfort</b> <b>of</b> denture use.
