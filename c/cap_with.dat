5|$|Species that {{resemble}} A.deserticola include the desert fungi Montagnea arenaria and Podaxis pistillaris. Montagnea arenaria is a whitish stalked puffball with a hollow, woody stalk and a loose sac-like volva {{at the base}} of the stem. It is topped by a thin disc-like <b>cap</b> <b>with</b> blackish gill plates suspended around the margin. Podaxis pistillaris has a cylindrical to oval white to brownish <b>cap</b> <b>with</b> a paper-thin wall atop a slender stem. When mature, the cap contains powdery, dark brown spores.|$|E
5|$|Mycena mustea {{is another}} similar Mycena that was {{discovered}} and reported concurrently with M.fonticola; it differs in forming a pale grayish purple <b>cap</b> <b>with</b> a low and broad umbo. Microscopically, it has club-shaped cheilocystidia with several apical short finger-like outgrowths, and nondiverticulate hyphae in the stem cuticle.|$|E
5|$|The red-cracked bolete (Xerocomellus chrysenteron) has an olive-brown {{cap that}} cracks, exposing flesh that ages to pinkish red. Boletellus chrysenteroides, {{found only in}} eastern North America, has a velvety to smooth, dark reddish brown, cracked <b>cap</b> <b>with</b> pale exposed flesh.|$|E

50|$|Frier {{was never}} <b>capped</b> <b>with</b> the senior {{national}} team, but he received five <b>caps</b> <b>with</b> France A, scoring one try in the process.|$|R
5|$|Field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus auripes from potential lookalike species include the yellowish brown to chestnut-brown cap surface that becomes paler with age, yellow flesh {{that does not}} stain blue, and a reticulate stem. B.aureissimus has a similar appearance, but has a honey-yellow to bright yellow or yellow-ochre cap, less conspicuous stem reticulation, and a more limited range covering Florida west to Texas. B.aureissimus var. castaneus has a purplish-brown <b>cap</b> <b>with</b> a texture like velvet.|$|E
5|$|Guzmán {{considers}} Psilocybe tampanensis to be intermediate in form between P.mexicana and P.caerulescens. Psilocybe mexicana {{has a more}} Mycena-like {{fruit body}} shape, and longer basidia measuring 22–24 by 7.7–11μm. It is known only from Mexico and Guatemala. Psilocybe caerulescens, found in the USA and Venezuela, is also somewhat similar, but has a collybioid habit (small to medium-sized mushrooms with a convex <b>cap),</b> <b>with</b> spores measuring 6.7–8 by 5.2–6.5 by 3.3–5.2μm, and cheilocystidia that are 15–22 by 4.4–5.5μm.|$|E
5|$|In {{the genus}} Boletus, B.auripes is {{classified}} in section Appendiculati. Species {{in this section}} are characterized by having a dry <b>cap</b> <b>with</b> a surface texture ranging from smooth to somewhat , yellow flesh, a reticulate stem, and a mild taste. Other North American boletes in this section include Boletus speciosus and Boletus regius.|$|E
50|$|Roberto Jan Hilbert (born 16 October 1984) is a German footballer who is {{currently}} a free agent. On international level, he earned eight <b>caps</b> <b>with</b> Germany's national team and twelve <b>caps</b> <b>with</b> the U21 team.|$|R
50|$|The company started {{producing}} baseball <b>caps</b> <b>with</b> stuffed wings after Red {{made one}} for herself. A separate division, Freemountain hats, produced <b>caps</b> <b>with</b> horns, antennae, and lightning bolts sewn on {{in addition to}} wings, with considerable sales success.|$|R
50|$|Ivanov has {{represented}} Bulgaria {{in the youth}} teams earning 7 <b>caps</b> <b>with</b> the U-18 and 25 <b>caps</b> <b>with</b> the Bulgaria U-21 national football teams. He was called-up to the senior team in 2000, earning a total of 5 caps within a two-year span.|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} type of Mycenaean helmet is the conical one {{reinforced}} with rows of boar tusks. This type was widely used and became the most identifiable piece of Mycenaean armor, being in use from the beginning to the collapse of Mycenaean culture. It is also known from several depictions in contemporary art in Greece and the Mediterranean. Boar's tusk helmets consisted of a felt-lined leather <b>cap,</b> <b>with</b> several rows of cut boar's tusk sewn onto it.|$|E
5|$|The mushroom's {{common names}} {{refer to the}} {{gastrointestinal}} distress they cause when consumed raw. The flesh is extremely peppery, but this offensive taste, along with its toxicity, can be removed by parboiling or pickling. Although {{it used to be}} widely eaten in Russia and eastern European countries, it is generally not recommended for consumption. There are many similar Russula species that have a red <b>cap</b> <b>with</b> white stem and gills, some of which can be reliably distinguished from R.emetica only by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} less-common species of Marasmius with which M.rotula might be {{confused}} due to somewhat similar overall appearances, but differences in size, gill arrangement, and substrate are usually sufficient field characteristics {{to distinguish between}} them. For example, Marasmius capillaris has a pale tan <b>cap</b> <b>with</b> a white center, and grows on oak leaves without forming clusters. Furthermore, its cap is evenly rounded, unlike the pleated and furrowed cap of M.rotula, and its stem is somewhat thinner (usually less than 0.3mm) and slightly darker in color.|$|E
50|$|<b>Capping</b> <b>with</b> NAD+, NADH, or 3'-dephospho-coenzyme A is {{targeted}} by promoter sequence. <b>Capping</b> <b>with</b> NAD+, NADH, or 3'-dephospho-coenzyme A occurs only at promoters that have certain sequences at and immediately upstream of the transcription start site and therefore occurs only for RNAs synthesized from certain promoters.|$|R

50|$|Wessel earned over 100 <b>caps</b> <b>with</b> the Bulls.|$|R
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Mycena, {{it is found}} in the section Filipedes, on account of the cheilocystidia covered with evenly spaced, short {{cylindrical}} excrescences, and its size and occurrence on wood. It can be separated from {{the other members of the}} section on account of a <b>cap</b> <b>with</b> yellowish to olive shades, gills with pinkish hints and stems with vaguely violet colouration.|$|E
5|$|As seen in Parthian coinage, the headdresses {{worn by the}} Parthian kings {{changed over}} time. The {{earliest}} Arsacid coins show rulers wearing the soft <b>cap</b> <b>with</b> cheek flaps, known as the bashlyk (Greek: kyrbasia). This may have derived from an Achaemenid-era satrapal headdress and the pointy hats depicted in the Achaemenid reliefs at Behistun and Persepolis. The earliest coins of Mithridates I show him wearing the soft cap, yet coins from {{the latter part of}} his reign show {{him for the first time}} wearing the royal Hellenistic diadem. Mithridates II was the first to be shown wearing the Parthian tiara, embroidered with pearls and jewels, a headdress commonly worn in the late Parthian period and by Sassanid monarchs.|$|E
5|$|Hiryū {{reinforced}} the <b>CAP</b> <b>with</b> launches of 3 more Zeros at 08:25. These fresh Zeros helped defeat the next American air strike from Midway, 11 Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers from VMSB-241, which attacked the battleship Haruna starting around 08:30. Haruna escaped damage and 3 of the Vindicators were shot down. Although all the American air strikes had thus far caused negligible damage, {{they kept the}} Japanese carrier forces off-balance as Nagumo endeavored to prepare a response to news, received at 08:20, of the sighting of American carrier forces to his northeast.|$|E

5|$|Inocybe maculata, {{commonly}} known as the frosty fibrecap, is a species of mushroom in the Inocybaceae family. First described by Jean Louis Émile Boudier in 1885, I. maculata can be found throughout Europe, Asia and North America. It is a medium-sized brown mushroom with a fibrous, brown <b>cap</b> <b>with</b> white remnants of a universal veil in the middle. The stem is cream or brown. The species is ectomycorrhizal and grows at the base of various trees, including beech. Inocybe maculata is poisonous, containing muscarine. Possible symptoms after consumption of I.maculata mushrooms are salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and vomiting, with the possibility of death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius lignyotellus and L.lignyotus {{are similar}} to L.fallax, {{and they are all}} {{associated}} with Picea and Abies; examination of microscopic features cannot be used to distinguish between them. L.lignyotus is restricted in distribution to eastern North America and Europe. Lactarius pseudomucidus is another milk <b>cap</b> <b>with</b> a dark brown cap, but it has a smooth (not velvety) and slimy cap and stem. Another brown-capped eastern North American species is L.gerardii; it has distantly spaced white gills that run down the stem. L.fuliginellus, which prefers to grow near hardwoods, has close gills.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius xanthogalactus {{has nearly}} {{identical}} microscopic features to L.vinaceorufescens, but macroscopically, {{it does not}} have the reddish-vinaceous stains that develop on the cap, gills, and stem of L.vinaceorufescens, and it grows on the ground under oak. Another lookalike is L.colorascens, but it may be distinguished from L.vinaceorufescens by several features: a smaller fruit body; a whitish cap that becomes brownish red with age and does not spot vinaceous or brown; bitter to faintly acrid latex; and slightly smaller spores. L.chrysorrheus is also similar, but it has a whitish to pale yellowish-cinnamon <b>cap</b> <b>with</b> slightly darker spots and grows under hardwoods (especially oak) on well-drained, often sandy soil, and its gills do not discolor or spot vinaceous or brown.|$|E

5|$|McLeod's {{received}} her first call-up {{to the senior}} national team in March 2002 for the Algarve Cup. She was among eight under-19 players that {{were added to the}} 20-player roster for the tournament in Portugal. McLeod earned her first international <b>cap</b> <b>with</b> the senior national team on March 3, 2002 in the team's second match of the tournament against Wales, recording her first shutout in the 4–0 win. She made a second appearance in the tournament in a match against Portugal on March 5, allowing one goal. McLeod made her final appearance of the tournament in the team's final match against Finland on March 7, allowing three goals.|$|E
5|$|The SS {{established}} its own symbolism, rituals, customs, {{ranks and}} uniforms to set itself {{apart from other}} organizations. Before 1929, the SS wore the same brown uniform as the SA, {{with the addition of}} a black tie and a black <b>cap</b> <b>with</b> a Totenkopf (death's head) skull and bones symbol, moving to an all-black uniform in 1932. In 1935, the SS combat formations adopted a service uniform in field grey for everyday wear. The SS also developed its own field uniforms, which included reversible smocks and helmet covers printed with camouflage patterns. Uniforms were manufactured in hundreds of licensed factories, with some workers being prisoners of war performing forced labor. Many were produced in concentration camps.|$|E
5|$|The {{headgear}} of {{the typical}} Confederate Infantryman was the slouch hat, or the military Kepi. The Kepi is a short fatigue and dress cap that was easy to manufacture for the Army during the war. This type of hat had its drawbacks, however. It provided little weather protection, and was worn out easily {{after a few months}} of hard wear. The Infantryman design cap was sky-blue with a dark blue band, but this was rarely seen outside of officer private-purchase caps. More typical would be the plain gray/brown <b>cap,</b> <b>with</b> or without the branch of service trim. There are examples of deep-south made caps that were trimmed in red cotton and wool, and issued to Infantry units, showing that any available clothing was issued to the troops as the war progressed.|$|E
