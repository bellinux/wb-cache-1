30|$|Timing and carrier {{synchronization}} is {{a fundamental}} requirement for any wireless communication system to work properly. Timing synchronization is {{the process by which}} a receiver node determines the correct instants of time at which to sample the incoming signal. Carrier synchronization is the process by which a receiver adapts the frequency and phase of its local <b>carrier</b> <b>oscillator</b> with those of the received signal. In this paper, we survey the literature over the last 5 years (2010 – 2014) and present a comprehensive literature review and classification of the recent research progress in achieving timing and carrier synchronization in single-input single-output (SISO), multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), cooperative relaying, and multiuser/multicell interference networks. Considering both single-carrier and multi-carrier communication systems, we survey and categorize the timing and carrier synchronization techniques proposed for the different communication systems focusing on the system model assumptions for synchronization, the synchronization challenges, and the state-of-the-art synchronization solutions and their limitations. Finally, we envision some future research directions.|$|E
30|$|Background and scope: Synchronization is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in nature, e.g., the synchronized flashing of fireflies or the synchronous firing of neurons in the human brain [15, 16]. In wireless communications, timing and carrier synchronization are fundamental requirements [17]. In general, a wireless receiver does not have prior knowledge of the physical wireless channel or propagation delay associated with the transmitted signal. Moreover, to keep {{the cost of the}} devices low, communication receivers use low-cost oscillators which inherently have some drift. In this context, timing synchronization is the process by which a receiver node determines the correct instants of time at which to sample the incoming signal and carrier synchronization is the process by which a receiver adapts the frequency and phase of its local <b>carrier</b> <b>oscillator</b> with those of the received signal. Particularly, depending on the specific communication systems, synchronization definition/procedure could be very different. According to 3 rd Generation Partnership Project, a terminology referred to as cell search has been widely used to represent an entire synchronization procedure, which may constitute both initial and target cell searches. Timing synchronization may consist of frame/slot/symbol/chip synchronizations, residual timing tracking, first arrival path search (in terms of OFDMA), multi-path search (in terms of CDMA), etc. Similarly, carrier synchronization may imply integer/fractional frequency offset estimation (in terms of OFDMA), coarse/fine frequency offset estimation (in terms of CDMA), residual frequency offset tracking, etc.|$|E

30|$|Besides BEM based channel {{estimation}} {{can more}} accurately estimate fast time-varying channels than LS based channel estimation does, another reason that a channel estimator with higher accuracy results in improved performance in time-varying channels is illustrated as follows. In OFDM systems, Doppler effects and instabilities of the {{transmitter and receiver}} <b>carrier</b> frequency <b>oscillators</b> will cause a loss of orthogonality between the subcarriers, resulting in ICI. The carrier frequency offset caused by Doppler effects in time-varying channels is {{a fraction of the}} subcarrier spacing (i.e., in most practical cases the normalized Doppler frequency is less than 0.2). If we want to compensate this effect, we are dealing with the problem of fine-frequency adjustment. One effect of carrier frequency offset is the detrimental effect of a rotation of the subcarriers [23, 24]. This effect will be recognized by a channel estimator, which does not distinguish between phase offsets caused by the channel and those caused by a frequency offset. Thus, a channel equalizer appears also to have fine frequency synchronization capabilities. Therefore it can be inferred that a channel estimator with higher accuracy can more accurately compensate this rotation caused by Doppler effects and thus will perform better in time-varying channels.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} estimating and tracking channels in a distributed transmission system with Nt transmit nodes and Nr receive nodes. Since each node in the distributed transmission system has an independent local oscillator, the effective channel between each transmit node and each receive node has time-varying phase and fre-quency offsets which much be tracked and predicted to facilitate coherent transmission. This paper presents a unified state-space model in which a single node aggregates all of the observations and tracks all of the channel states in the system. To quantify the performance of this tracking system, the steady-state prediction covariance is analyzed. Since the dimension of the prediction covariance matrix grows proportionally to the product NtNr, the resulting discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation is difficult to solve for large systems, e. g., distributed massive MIMO systems. It is shown, however, that {{the structure of the}} dynamic model allows the steady-state prediction covariance to be efficiently calculated irrespective of the number of transmit and receive nodes. An asymptotic analysis is also presented for systems with a large number of transmit and receive nodes with closed-from results for all of the elements in the asymptotic prediction covariance {{as a function of the}} <b>carrier</b> frequency, <b>oscillator</b> parameters, and channel measurement period.

It can increase tracking errors of the phase-locked loop (PLL) in a GPS receiver and even cause the PLL loss of lock under severe scintillations. To mitigate the effect of scintillation on GPS receivers, especially to reduce the occurrence of loss of lock, a multi-PLL with two-stage fusion (i. e., tracking fusion and output fusion) is proposed in this paper. This algorithm integrates several parallel sub-PLLs with different loop parameters into one channel to track one GPS satellite's signal. Every sub-PLL has its own discriminator, loop filter, <b>carrier</b> numerical controlled <b>oscillator,</b> and a tracking fusion (i. e., the first stage fusion). The tracking fusion of each sub-PLL integrates the Doppler frequency measurements from all other sub-PLLs to detect the state of its own sub-PLL and feeds back reliable Doppler frequency measurements. Simultaneously, the tracking fusion outputs the Doppler frequency measurements to the second stage fusion (i. e., output fusion), which integrates the outputs from all tracking fusions to provide continuous and accurate Doppler frequency measurements for the following positioning/navigation estimator. Performances of the proposed algorithm are tested using real-world GPS data with different levels of scintillations and compared with results from single-PLLs.

With the increased density of sensor nodes (more number of in-band interference sources) and degraded performance of analog circuits in the nano-meter CMOS process technologies, the spur reduction techniques are essential to improve the performance of frequency synthesizers in these applications. A single chip solution of sensor nodes with its analog and digital circuits integrated on the same die is preferred for its low power, low cost, and reduced size implementation. However, the parasitic interactions between these analog and digital sub-systems integrated on a common substrate, degrade the spectral performance of frequency synthesizers in these implementations[2]. Therefore, techniques to improve the mixed signal integration performance of these circuits are in great demand. In this thesis, we present a custom designed energy efficient 2. 4 GHz BFSK/ASK transmitter architecture using a low power frequency synthesizer design technique taking advantage of the CMOS technology scaling benefits. Furthermore, a few design guidelinesandsolutionstoimprovethespectralperformanceoffrequency synthesizer circuits and in-turn the performance of transmitters are also presented. The target application being short distance, low power, and battery operated wireless communication applications. The contributions in this thesis are, Spectral performance improvement techniques The CP mismatch current is a dominant source of reference spurs in the nano-meter CMOS PLL implementations due to its worsened channel length modulation effect [3]. In this work, we present a CP mismatch current calibration technique using an adaptive body bias tuning of its PMOS transistors. Chip prototype of 2. 4 GHzCP-PLLwith the proposed CP calibration technique was fabricated in UMC 0. 13 µm CMOS process. Measurements show a CP mismatch current of less than 0. 3 µA(0. 55 %) using the proposed calibration technique over the VCO control voltage range 0. 3 to 1 V. The closed loop PLL measurements using the proposed technique exhibited a 9 dB reduction in the reference spur levels across the PLL output frequency range 2. 4 - 2. 5 GHz. The parasitic interactions between analog and digital circuits through the common substrate severely affects the performance of CP-PLLs. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the effect of periodic switching noise generated from the digital buffers on the performance of charge-pump PLLs. The sensitivity of PLL performance metrics such as output spur level, phase noise, and output jitter are monitored against the variations in the properties of a noise injector digital signal. Measurements from a 500 MHz CP-PLL shows that the pulsed noise injection with the duty cycle of noise injector signal reduced from 50 % to 20 %, resulted in a 12. 53 dB reduction in its output spur level and a 107 ps reduction in its Pk-Pk deterministic period jitter performance. Low power circuit techniques A low power frequency synthesizer design using a digital frequency multiplication technique is presented. The proposed frequency multiply by 3 digital edge combiner design having a very few logic gates, demonstrated a significant reduction in the power consumption of frequency synthesizer circuits, with an acceptable spectral performance suitable for these relaxed performance applications. A few design guidelines and techniques to further improve its spectral performance are also discussed and validated through simulations. Chip prototypes of 2. 4 GHz CP-PLLs with and without digital frequency multiplier circuits are fabricated in UMC 0. 13 µm CMOS process. The 2. 4 GHz CP-PLL using the proposed digital frequency multiplication technique (10. 7 mW) consumed a much reduced power compared to a conventional implementation(20. 3 mW). A custom designed, energy efficient 2. 4 GHz BFSK/ASK transmitter architecture using the proposed low power frequency synthesizer design technique is presented. The transmitter uses a class-D power amplifier to drive the 50 Ω antenna load. Spur reduction techniques in frequency synthesizers are also used to improve the spectral performance of the transmitter. A chip prototype of the proposed transmitter architecture was implemented in UMC 0. 13 µm CMOS process. The transmitter consume 14 mA current from a 1. 3 V supply voltage and achieve improved energy efficiencies of 0. 91 nJ/bit and 6. 1 nJ/bit for ASK and BFSK modulations with data rates 20 Mb/s & 3 Mb/s respectively...|$|R
