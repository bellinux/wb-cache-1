50|$|Berardius is {{currently}} classified as containing two species: Arnoux's beaked whale (Berardius arnuxii) in the Southern Hemisphere waters, and Baird's beaked whale (Berardius bairdii) in the North Pacific. Arnoux's beaked whale {{was described by}} Georges Louis Duvernoy in 1851. The genus name honors admiral Auguste Bérard (1796-1852), who was <b>captain</b> <b>of</b> the French <b>corvette</b> Le Rhin (1842-1846), which brought back the type specimen to France where Duvernoy analyzed it; the species name honors Maurice Arnoux, the ship's surgeon who found the skull of the type specimen on a beach near Akaroa, New Zealand. Baird's beaked whale was first described by Leonhard Hess Stejneger in 1883 from a four-toothed skull he had found on Bering Island the previous year. The species is named for Spencer Fullerton Baird, a past Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the next}} two decades, Makarov {{specialized}} in naval research, publishing over fifty papers on oceanography and naval tactics. [...] As <b>captain</b> <b>of</b> the <b>corvette</b> Vityaz Makarov directed a round-the-world oceanographic expedition from 1886-89. When Makarov was promoted to rear admiral in 1890, he was the youngest person to reach such {{a position in the}} history of the Russian navy. [...] From 1890-1894, Makarov was Chief Inspector of Naval Ordinance, during which time he invented the “Makarov cap”, an armor-piercing projectile whose design was soon copied by all navies. From 1894-1895, Makarov was commander of the Mediterranean Squadron. [...] From 1895-1896, Makarov was in charge of naval training. He became a vice admiral in 1896, and began to concentrate on the design for new warships, especially icebreakers needed to establish a northern sea route between Europe and East Asia. [...] Makarov led an expedition to survey the mouths of the Ob and the Yenisei Rivers in 1897. As part of his research on icebreaking methods, Makarov visited the Great Lakes of America in 1898 to study methods in use by railroad ferries in winter.He proposed the world's first icebreaker, the Yermak, oversaw her construction, and commanded her on her maiden voyage in 1899. In 1899, Makarov was also appointed commander and military governor of Kronstadt in January 1900. In 1901, Makarov commanded the Yermak on an Arctic expedition to survey the coasts of Novaya Zemlya and Franz Josef Land.|$|R
40|$|So far the Crustacean fauna of Easter Island has {{received}} but very little attention. In most early narratives of expeditions visiting the island no mention {{is made of}} any Crustacean. Behrens (1908 : 135) who accompanied Jacob Roggeveen on the voyage during which, in 1722, the island was discovered, stated in his diary that "No animals were met with, {{as far as we}} penetrated on this occasion, except sundry species of birds". Cornelis Bouman, <b>captain</b> <b>of</b> the ship "Tienhoven" of Roggeveen's expedition, did not mention any Crustacean from Easter Island, even though in his narrative he shows a great interest in marine life, as is clearly demonstrated by his account of the expedition's visit to Juan Fernandez (24 February to 17 March 1722) in which he repeatedly mentioned the presence of "delicaete creeften" (delicious lobsters) at that island (cf. Mulert, 1911 : 123 - 127, 134 - 144). Also Cook, Laperouse, Beechey, and other early explorers, who visited the island do not report the presence of Crustacea. Only Hervé (1908 : 122) in his account of Gonzalez's 1770 voyage reported "small crabs" from the outer of the small islets at the S. E. tip of Easter Island. The first positive mention of the occurrence of macrurous Decapods on the island seems to be by Gana (1870). In early 1870 Ignacio L. Gana, <b>captain</b> <b>of</b> the <b>corvette</b> "O'Higgins" <b>of</b> the Chilean navy, made an 8 days visit to Easter Island. He was charged by his government to make a scientific description of the island, which study was published by him in 1870. A french translation of this report was given by De Lapelin (1872). F. T. de Lapelin, vice-admiral of the French Pacific fleet visited Easter Island in the "Flore", anchoring off Hanga Roa on 3 January 1872. Through circumstances he was only able to verify a great part of the information provided by previous visitors but "elle ne nous...|$|R

But Becker could not prevent the hunted Laupepa from taking refuge in any hole that offered, and he could afford to smile at the fantastic orgie in the embassy. It was another matter when the Hawaiians approached the intractable Mataafa, sitting still in his Atua government like Achilles in his tent, helping neither side, and (as the Germans suspected) keeping the eggs warm for himself. When the Kaimiloa steamed out of Apia on this visit, the German war-ship Adler followed at her heels; and Mataafa was no sooner set down with the embassy than he was summoned and ordered on board by two German officers. The step is one of those triumphs of temper which can only be admired. Mataafa is entertaining the plenipotentiary of a sovereign power in treaty with his own king, and the <b>captain</b> <b>of</b> a German <b>corvette</b> orders him to quit his guests.|$|R
