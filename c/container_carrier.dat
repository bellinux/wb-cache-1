In 2013 however, APL stopped offering vessel space for 53-foot containers on its trans-Pacific ships.

30|$|Extra {{waiting time}} for containerships is {{something}} that is viewed critically by <b>container</b> <b>carriers.</b> In contrast to the critical attitude of cargo carriers towards waiting time in ports, the adaption of containerships’ cruising speeds (also known as slow steaming) is not seen as a problem. For <b>container</b> <b>carriers,</b> their biggest costs are fuel. These costs can be reduced by adapting the ship’s speed: a reduction to 80 % saves 60 % of fuel costs, and a reduction to 60 % saves 90 % of fuel costs (Weismann 2010). A market survey has shown that 75 % of the surveyed liners and carriers apply slow steaming in order to save bunker costs (Seatrade Global 2014). Because fuel costs are so high, <b>container</b> <b>carriers</b> operate more efficiently by sailing at lower speeds. In this regard, the extra travel time is compensated by fuel savings.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTIn {{the present}} study, the {{structural}} response of breakwaters installed on <b>container</b> <b>carriers</b> against green water impact loads was numerically investigated {{on the basis}} of the fluid-structure interaction analysis. A series of numerical studies is carried out to induce breakwater collapse under such conditions, whereby a widely accepted fluid-structure interaction analysis technique is adopted to realistically consider the phenomenon of green water impact loads. In addition, the structural behaviour of these breakwaters under green water impact loads is investigated simultaneously throughout the transient analysis. A verification study of the numerical results is performed using data from actual collapse incidents of breakwaters on <b>container</b> <b>carriers.</b> On the basis of the results of a series of numerical analyses, the pressure distribution of green water was accurately predicted with respect to wave mass and velocity. It is expected that the proposed analytical methodology and predicted pressure distribution could be used as a practical guideline for the design of breakwaters on <b>container</b> <b>carriers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The role of {{container}} {{logistics centre}} as home bases for merchandise transportation {{has become increasingly}} important. The <b>container</b> <b>carriers</b> need to select a suitable centre location of transshipment port {{to meet the requirements}} of container shipping logistics. In the light of this, the main {{purpose of this paper is}} to develop a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model to evaluate the best selection of transshipment ports for <b>container</b> <b>carriers.</b> At first, some concepts and methods used to develop the proposed model are briefly introduced. The performance values of quantitative and qualitative subcriteria are discussed to evaluate the fuzzy ratings. Then, the ideal and anti-ideal concepts and the modified distance measure method are used in the proposed model. Finally, a step-by-step example is illustrated to study the computational process of the quantitative and qualitative fuzzy MCDM model. The proposed approach has successfully accomplished our goal. In addition, the proposed fuzzy MCDM model can be empirically employed to select the best location of transshipment port for <b>container</b> <b>carriers</b> in the future study...|$|R

30|$|Besides the {{positive}} effect of cost savings, {{the reduction of}} peak energy demand has consequences for the handling time. In most scenarios (depending on how much the number of simultaneously lifting cranes and energy demand per second is limited), the extra handling time would be less than half a minute per hour. The question is whether <b>container</b> <b>carriers</b> are willing to accept extra handling time. Container terminals need to be prepared to negotiate with <b>container</b> <b>carriers</b> about some sort of compensation. This could be financial, but might also relate to extra service (e.g. free electricity power for ships while berthed) or sustainability agreements. Irrespective of how costs are allocated, this research has shown that container terminals can reduce their peak-related energy costs by managing their energy consumption in a smarter way.|$|R
