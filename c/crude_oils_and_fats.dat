40|$|Feed {{value in}} form of FEsv (Feed unit / kg dry matter, for piglets) and FEso (Feed unit / kg dry matter, for sows), EDOM (Enzyme Degradable Organic Matter) and EDOMi (Enzyme Degradable Organic Matter, Ileum) {{is used in the}} feed {{evaluation}} system for pigs. Analysis of feed value have highlighted that there is a significant variation between varieties as well as due to an environmental variation between regions and the harvest year. The chemical analysis is, however, time-consuming and costly, and it is therefore desirable to have a rapid and less expensive method, which makes it possible to carry out more analyses in-situ. Near infra-red reflection spectroscopy (NIRS) is appropriate as a standard analysis of dry matter, total N and starch in grains, since it is rapid (approximately 1 minute per measurement of a ground test) and cheap. NIRS is therefore appropriate as a quick method for the determination of EDOM, EDOMi, FEso and FEsv. The outcome of a successful NIRS calibration will be a relatively cheap tool to monitor, diversify and evaluate the quality of cereals for animal feed, a possible tool to assess the feed value of new varieties in the variety testing and a useful, cheap and rapid tool for cereal breeders. A collection of 1213 grain samples of wheat, triticale, barley and rye, and related chemical reference analyses to describe the feed value have been established. The samples originate from available field trials over a three-year period. The chemical reference analyses are dry matter, crude protein, crude ash, <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> <b>fats,</b> EDOM, EDOMi, FEso and FEsv. All samples were ground on a laboratory mill and scans were obtained using a QFA-Flex 400 FT-NIR instrument (Q-interline, Roskilde, Denmark). The samples were packed in glass vials with a height of 6 cm and a diameter of 2. 6 cm and measured using a rotating sample device. The sample was rotated with a speed of three rounds per minute, with a measuring sample window at the rotating sample device has a diameter of 6 mm and the analysis surface is 510 mm 2. NIR measurements in the range from 800 to 2500 nm with data collection at every 2 nm were performed on grounded and dried aliquots. The development of the NIRS method to determine feed value has been struggled {{by the fact that the}} chemical reference analysis has been subject to considerable error. Despite this, it has been possible to develop a wide-ranging calibration model predicting the feed value FEsv and FEso for wheat, barley and triticale. Status of the developed model is a SEP (standard error of performance) of 1. 7...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{study of}} <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> its polar {{fractions}} oil-water interfacial film dilational viscoelasticity has important significance {{to understand the}} stability of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> emulsion. By interfacial expansion rheological determinator, the Gudao <b>Crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> its fractions dilational viscoelasticity under different pH value and dilational frequency was tested. The result shows that the dilational modulus of Asphaltene, Resin, <b>Crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>Oil</b> fraction reduced gradually under different dilational frequency and pH value, which has a relationship with polar groups in the <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> its fractions. When pH value was different, <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> its fractions dilational modulus and dilational frequency was similar. Dilational modulus increased with the increases of dilational frequency, but increasing amplitudes were different. Under the same pH value, dilational viscosity and phrase angle of <b>Crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> its fractions were decreased {{with the increase of}} dilational frequency. The influence degree on different fractions was different, the influence degree of Oil fraction of dilational viscosity and phrase angle was small, Asphaltene was big. The dilational elasticity of <b>Crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> its fractions increased with the increase of dilational frequency. Under different dilational frequency, the dilational modulus of <b>Crude</b> <b>oil,</b> Resin <b>and</b> Asphaltene increased with the increase of pH value, and it had no influence on dilational modulus of Oil fraction. The total dilational elasticity tendency of <b>Crude</b> <b>oil,</b> Resin <b>and</b> Asphaltene was increase, while dilational elasticity of Oil fraction decreased with the increases of pH value.

30|$|Furthermore, the {{viscosity}} of the blended {{mixture is}} determined by the dilution rate as well as the viscosities and densities of the heavy <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> bitumen and the used diluents. The resulting blend of heavy <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> diluents has lower viscosity and therefore it is easier to pump at reduced cost. The dilution of heavy <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> bitumen to enhance transportation by pipelines requires two pipelines, one for the <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> another for the diluents. The use of diluents to enhance the transportability of heavy <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> bitumen in pipelines would be cost-effective, if the diluents are relatively cheap and readily available. The amount of diluents required for heavy <b>crude</b> <b>oil,</b> i.e. the ratio of diluents in the blended mixture, ranges from 0 to 20  %, while for bitumen it is in the range of 25 – 50  %.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to analyse causality between prices of corn, <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> ethanol. The analysis conducted in this paper is a dynamic one, and the data used consist of weekly futures prices of <b>crude</b> <b>oil,</b> corn, <b>and</b> ethanol from January 5, 2007 till April 11, 2014. The assessment of causal links between prices of corn, <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> ethanol is carried out {{with the use of}} rolling regression applied to augmented-VAR framework proposed by Toda and Yamamoto (1995). The application of the rolling regression procedures into the modified Wald (MWALD) causality test allows for the investigation of the persistence of stability in causal relations between analysed prices. The results obtained indicate that the linkages between energy prices and agricultural commodity prices change in the period analysed. The results of Granger causality tests reveal that in the analysed period the price of corn influences the price of energy (<b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> ethanol). Also <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> prices influence corn prices and ethanol prices. However, the influence of ethanol prices on <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> prices <b>and</b> corn prices has not been observed. ...|$|R
30|$|It is hard {{to recover}} <b>and</b> process heavy <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> bitumen, owing to their high {{viscosity}} (i.e. resistance to flow) at reservoir conditions (making their mobility extremely low) and high carbon-to-hydrogen atomic ratios. Hitherto, with the rising price of <b>crude</b> <b>oil,</b> declining reserves of medium <b>and</b> light <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> the abundance of unconventional <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> (i.e. heavy <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> bitumen/tar sands), their exploitation is therefore favoured. However, heavy <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> bitumen exploitation is faced with technical challenges at all stages from recovery/production from the reservoir to transportation and refining. Transporting heavy <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> bitumen via pipeline is usually challenging due to their high density and viscosity (> 1, 000  cP) and very low mobility at reservoir temperature. Asphaltene deposition, heavy metals, sulphur and brine or salt content {{make it difficult to}} be transported and refined using conventional refinery methods without firstly upgrading them to meet conventional light <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> properties (Zhang et al. 2010; Hart 2012). Also, the presence of brine or salt in the heavy crude stimulates corrosion problems in the pipeline (Martinez-Palou et al. 2011). In some cases, the formation of emulsion such as the oil–water mixture produced from the reservoir poses transportation difficulty.|$|R
