5|$|AMiBA was {{originally}} configured as a 7-element interferometer atop a hexapod mount. Observations at a wavelength of 3mm (86–102GHz) started in October 2006, and the detections of six clusters by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect were announced in 2008. In 2009 the telescope was upgraded to 13 elements, {{and it is}} capable of further expansion to 19 elements.

5|$|Efforts made {{by local}} {{authorities}} in the Cluj-Napoca district {{at the end of}} the 1990s to reform the protection of children's rights and assistance for street children proved insufficient due to lack of funding, incoherent policies and the absence of any real <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> actors involved (Child Rights Protection Directorate, Social Assistance Service within the District Directorate for Labour and Social Protection, Minors Receiving Centre, Guardian Authority within the City Hall, Police). There are numerous street children, whose poverty and lack of documented identity brings them into constant conflict with local law enforcement.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{introduced}} {{the system of}} International Nonproprietary Names in 1950, with the first INN list being published three years later. The stem -mab for monoclonal antibodies was proposed around 1990, and the current system with target and source substems was developed between 1991 and 1993. Due to the <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> WHO and the United States Adopted Names Council, antibody USANs have the same structure and are largely identical to INNs. Until 2009, more than 170 monoclonal antibodies received names following this nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{subsequent}} expeditions, {{the crew}} of Expedition 1 had a somewhat modest amount of science experiments to conduct, due to the priority placed on station construction.

5|$|With {{the land}} secured, the campus was {{designed}} {{in a way}} to ensure the maximum <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> different sciences, with buildings laid along radial streets emanating from a central circular plaza, which also hosted administrative buildings. The layout of the campus would eventually be used on the design of the university's logo, created by Max Schiefer, which is essentially a simplified map of the core circle of the campus. This design is similar to the University of California, Irvine campus, build around the same time.|$|E
5|$|A <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Welland Rivers Trust, the Wild Trout Trust and the Environment Agency has {{resulted}} in the construction of a rock ramp, to allow migrating sea trout to pass up the river beyond the weir on the Maxey Cut, which was acting as a barrier. Some 300 tons of rock, with 50 tons of finer material forming a top layer, were used to create the ramp. The finer material ensures that water mainly flows over the ramp, rather than through it. The ramp also enables young eels or elvers to move up the river, and provides habitat for stone loach and bullheads.|$|E
5|$|After his accession, Diocletian and Lucius Caesonius Bassus {{were named}} as consuls and assumed the fasces {{in place of}} Carinus and Numerianus. Bassus {{was a member of}} a senatorial family from Campania, a former consul and proconsul of Africa, chosen by Probus for signal distinction. He was skilled in areas of {{government}} where Diocletian presumably had no experience. Diocletian's elevation of Bassus as consul symbolized his rejection of Carinus' government in Rome, his refusal to accept second-tier status to any other emperor, and his willingness to continue the long-standing <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> empire's senatorial and military aristocracies. It also tied his success to that of the Senate, whose support he would need in his advance on Rome.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Labcabincalifornia, member Fatlip split from The Pharcyde, and the group did not return until 2000, {{releasing}} the album Plain Rap to mediocre reviews. Though the album marked the first <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> group and J-Swift, Bootie Brown and Imani had a falling out with SlimKid (now known by his birth name Tre Hardson), before the album was released, turning the group into a duo. In 2004, Imani and Bootie released the group's fourth album, Humboldt Beginnings, receiving little attention and harsh reviews. Tre and Fatlip have both since released solo albums, but no project released by the group or its members since their debut {{has been able to}} reach the acclaim of Bizarre Ride.|$|E
5|$|Hayward credits Besson with {{showing the}} <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Burgundians and the English more {{accurately}} than previous filmmakers. Many lines during scenes of Joan's trial are taken verbatim from Joan's real trial transcript. Joan is shown receiving both wounds {{she was given}} in real life (an arrow above the breast and later an arrow to the leg), and the film includes some of the 15th-century accounts associated with Joan, such as being able to pick out Charles VII from {{among a group of}} his courtiers at Chinon. The examining of Joan's virginity was a real test Joan had to complete to prove her merit.|$|E
5|$|Hulagu Khan, a {{grandson}} of Genghis Khan, was an avowed shamanist, but was nevertheless very tolerant of Christianity. His mother Sorghaghtani Beki, his favorite wife Doquz Khatun, {{and several of}} his closest collaborators were Nestorian Christians. One of his most important generals, Kitbuqa, was a Nestorian Christian of the Naiman tribe. Military <b>collaboration</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Mongols and their Christian vassals became substantial in 1258–1260. Hulagu's army, with the forces of his Christian subjects Bohemond VI of Antioch, Hethum I of Armenia, and the Christian Georgians, effectively destroyed two of the most powerful Muslim dynasties of the era: the Abbasids in Baghdad and the Ayyubids in Syria.|$|E
