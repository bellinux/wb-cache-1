40|$|ATP-sensitive K / (KATP) {{channels}} are nucleotide-gated channels that couple the metabolic {{status of a}} cell with membrane excitability and regulate a number of cellular functions, including hormone secretion and cardioprotection. Although intracellular ATP is the endogenous inhibitor of KATP channels and ADP serves as the channel activator, {{it is still a}} matter of debate whether changes in the intracellular concentrations of ATP, ADP, and/or in the ATP/ADP ratio could account for the transition from the ATP-liganded to the ADP-liganded channel state. Here, we overview evidence for the role of cellular phosphotransfer cascades in the regulation of KATP channels. The microenvironment of the KATP channel harbors several phosphotransfer enzymes, including adenylate, creatine, and pyruvate kinases, as well as other glycolytic enzymes that are able to transfer phosphoryls between ATP and ADP in the absence of major changes in cytosolic levels of adenine nucleotides. These phosphotransfer reactions are governed by the metabolic status of a cell, and their phosphotransfer rate closely correlates with KATP channel activity. Adenylate kinase catalysis accelerates the transition from ATP to ADP, leading to KATP channel opening, while phosphotransfers driven by creatine and pyruvate kinases promote ADP to ATP transition and channel closure. Thus, through delivery and removal of adenine nucleotides at the channel site, phosphotransfer reactions could regulate ATP/ADP balance in the immediate vicinity of the channel and thereby the probability of KATP channel opening. In this way, phosphotransfer reactions could provide a transduction mechanism coupling cellular metabolic signals with KATP <b>channel-associate...</b>|$|R

The Abs are directed against membrane receptors and ion <b>channel-associated</b> proteins that are expressed on the surface of neurons in the CNS, such as N-methyl D-aspartate receptors and leucine-rich, glioma inactivated protein and contactin-associated protein like, that are associated with voltage-gated potassium channels. The diseases are not invariably cancer-related and are therefore different from the classical paraneoplastic neurological diseases that are associated with, but not caused by, Abs to intracellular proteins. Diagnosis of autoimmune encephalopathy is based on the clinical course, serologic evidence of autoimmunity, severe but nonspecific slowing on electroencephalography, and evidence of intrathecal inflammation in the cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging by MRI. Treatment include first-line steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), and plasma exchange, and second-line Rituximab and Cyclophosphamide, followed in many cases by steroid-sparing agents in the long-term.|$|E

40|$|Voltage-gated {{sodium channel}} {{function}} from neonatal and adult rat cardiomyocytes was measured and compared. Channels from neonatal ventricles required an ∼ 10 mV greater depolarization for voltage-dependent gating events than did channels from neonatal atria and adult atria and ventricles. We questioned whether such gating shifts {{were due to}} developmental and/or chamber-dependent changes in <b>channel-associated</b> functional sialic acids. Thus, all gating characteristics for channels from neonatal atria and adult atria and ventricles shifted significantly to more depolarized potentials after removal of surface sialic acids. Desialylation of channels from neonatal ventricles did not affect channel gating. After removal of the complete surface N-glycosylation structures, gating of channels from neonatal atria and adult atria and ventricles shifted to depolarized potentials nearly identical to those measured for channels from neonatal ventricles. Gating of channels from neonatal ventricles were unaffected by such deglycosylation. Immunoblot gel shift analyses indicated that voltage-gated sodium channel α subunits from neonatal atria and adult atria and ventricles are more heavily sialylated than α subunits from neonatal ventricles. The data are consistent with approximately 15 more sialic acid residues attached to each α subunit from neonatal atria and adult atria and ventricles. The data indicate that differential sialylation of myocyte voltage-gated sodium channel α subunits is responsible {{for much of the}} developmental and chamber-specific remodeling of channel gating observed here. Further, cardiac excitability is likely impacted by these sialic acid–dependent gating effects, such as modulation of the rate of recovery from inactivation.

Human reticulocyte pICln (HRpICln) cDNA encodes a protein (predicted molecular mass 26293 Da) identical with human non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cell pICln. By using full-length HRpICln cDNA (approx. 1. 2 kb) to probe human lymphocyte metaphase-chromosome spreads, {{the location of}} the human ICln gene was mapped to 11 q 13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Polyclonal antibodies to recombinant HRpICln detected bands at approx. 43 kDa and approx. 37 kDa in both normal (AA) and sickle (SS) red blood cell (RBC) ghost membranes. In SS ghosts, and in ghosts from a patient with autoimmune haemolytic anaemia with 9. 8 % reticulocytes, the amount of HRpICln was increased compared with AA ghosts, suggesting that the expression or membrane assembly of HRpICln is cell age-dependent. Laser scanning confocal fluorescent microscopy immunolocalized HRpICln largely to the RBC membrane. The increased staining intensity of HRpICln in a reticulocyte-enriched AA RBC density-separated fraction is consistent with a dependence of HRpICln membrane content on cell age. HRpICln and beta-actin form stable complexes in vivo, demonstrated with the yeast two-hybrid system. Low-ionic-strength extraction of ghost membranes, which results in the extraction of the spectrin-actin cytoskeleton, also results in the extraction of HRpICln, consistent with the possibility for the association of these proteins in RBCs in vivo. The results presented here establish the presence of the Cl- <b>channel-associated</b> protein, pICln, in human RBCs, and raises the possibility that this protein has a role in RBC Cl- transport and volume regulation in young RBCs. Moreover the association of RBC pICln with actin offers a model in which to test interactions between RBC ion channels and the cytoskeleton...|$|E

In this study, we used the genetically encoded calcium indicator cameleon to record cellular responses of mechanosensory neurons to touch stimuli in intact, behaving nematodes. We defined a gentle touch sensory modality that adapts with a time course of approximately 500 ms and primarily senses motion rather than pressure. The DEG/ENaC channel subunit MEC- 4 and <b>channel-associated</b> stomatin MEC- 2 are specifically required for neural responses to gentle mechanical stimulation, but do not affect the basic physiology of touch neurons or their in vivo responses to harsh mechanical stimulation.

40|$|AbstractVoltage-gated sodium {{channels}} with “resurgent” kinetics are specialized for high-frequency firing. The α subunits {{interact with}} a blocking protein that binds open channels upon depolarization and unbinds upon repolarization, producing resurgent sodium current. By limiting classical inactivation, {{the cycle of}} block and unblock shortens refractory periods. To characterize the blocker in Purkinje neurons, we briefly exposed inside-out patches to substrate-specific proteases. Trypsin and chymotrypsin each removed resurgent current, consistent with established roles for positively charged and hydrophobic/aromatic groups in blocking sodium channels. In Purkinje cells, the only known sodium <b>channel-associated</b> subunit that has a cytoplasmic sequence with several positive charges and clustered hydrophobic/aromatic residues is β 4 (KKLITFILKKTREK; β 4154 – 167). After enzymatic removal of block, β 4154 – 167 fully reconstituted resurgent current, whereas scrambled or point-mutated peptides were ineffective. In CA 3 pyramidal neurons, which lack β 4 and endogenous block, β 4154 – 167 generated resurgent current. Thus, β 4 may be the endogenous open-channel blocker responsible for resurgent kinetics...|$|E

TCAF 1 and TCAF 2 both bind to the TRPM 8 channel and promote its trafficking to the cell surface. However, they exert opposing effects on TRPM 8 gating properties. Functional interaction of TCAF 1 /TRPM 8 also leads to a reduction in both the speed and directionality of migration of prostate cancer cells, which is consistent with an observed loss of expression of TCAF 1 in metastatic human specimens, whereas TCAF 2 promotes migration.
