5|$|Roller <b>coasters</b> are {{amusement}} rides {{developed for}} amusement parks and modern theme parks.

Although wooden roller <b>coasters</b> are still being produced, steel roller <b>coasters</b> are more common {{and can be found}} on every continent except Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|A Floorless Coaster {{is a type}} {{of steel}} roller coaster {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where riders sit with no floor underneath them allowing their feet to swing freely just above the track. Development of the Floorless Coaster began between 1995 and 1996 with Medusa (now known as Bizarro) at Six Flags Great Adventure opening on April 2, 1999, making it the world's first Floorless Coaster. Floorless <b>Coasters</b> also tend to have 3 to 7 inversions incorporated in the layout of the coaster. Recently, Bolliger & Mabillard have used floorless trains on their Dive <b>Coasters,</b> such as Griffon and SheiKra. Though they contain floorless trains, the <b>coasters</b> are still not considered Floorless <b>Coasters</b> as B classifies them as another model. Also, Maurer Söhne have designed their own version of the Floorless Coaster, a variant of their X-Car called X-Car Floorless, but currently do not have any installations.|$|E

5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bolliger & Mabillard roller <b>coasters</b> is the {{box-section}} track.

However, on some Bolliger & Mabillard roller <b>coasters,</b> such as Talon at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and Gatekeeper at Cedar Point the track is filled with sand to reduce this noise.|$|E
