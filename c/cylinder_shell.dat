50|$|The RPV {{provides}} {{a critical role}} in safety of the PWR reactor and the materials used must be able to contain the reactor core at elevated temperatures and pressures. The materials used in the cylindrical shell of the vessels have evolved over time, but in general they consist of low-alloy ferritic steels clad with 3-10mm of austenitic stainless steel. The stainless steel cladding is primarily used in locations that come into contact with coolant in order to minimize corrosion. Through the mid-1960, SA-302, Grade B, a molybdenum-magnesium plate steel, was used {{in the body of the}} vessel. As changing designs required larger pressure vessels, the addition of nickel to this alloy by roughly 0.4-0.7 wt% was required to increase the yield strength. Other common steel alloys include SA-533 Grade B Class 1 and SA-508 Class 2. Both materials have main alloying elements of nickel, manganese, molybdenum, and silicon, but the latter also includes 0.25-0.45 wt% chromium. All alloy listed also have >0.04 wt% sulfur. The table below gives the weight percent of elements in commonly used ferritic steels for reactor components according to ASTM requirements.Low-alloyed NiMoMn ferritic steels are attractive for this purpose due to their high thermal conductivity and low thermal expansion, properties that make them resistant to thermal shock. However, when considering the properties of these steels, one must take into account the response it will have to radiation damage. Due to harsh conditions, the RPV <b>cylinder</b> <b>shell</b> material is often the lifetime-limiting component for a nuclear reactor.

30|$|High modulus {{carbon fiber}} is an {{excellent}} industrial material, which is widely used in several fields such as satellite supporting <b>cylinder,</b> <b>shells</b> of rocket engine, and solar array. The composite manufacturing process {{is the key to}} the application of carbon fiber. Filament winding has emerged as the main process for fabricating composite structures. It is widely used in building rotational parts. In the filament winding process, the carbon fiber is delivered from the unwind roll and passed through the resin bath to mix with resin under different temperatures and finally wrap around the surface of the mandrel in the designed pattern. The major specifications that should be satisfied during the winding process are the winding line type and the fiber tension, which are considered to be the key factors related to the tensile strength of the fiber products. The winding line type is determined using the numerical control system, so this paper focuses on the tension control problem during the winding process. Researchers have shown that unstable tension may lead to loss in strength of fiber winding products [1]. Therefore, fiber tension should be maintained at the reference value during the winding process for ensuring the product quality.|$|R

40|$|The optimal {{and robust}} design of {{structures}} has gained much {{attention in the}} past ten years due to the ever increasing need for manufacturers to build robust systems at the lowest cost. Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) allows the analyst to minimize some cost function while ensuring some minimal performances cast as admissible probabilities of failure for a set of performance functions. In order to address real-world problems in which the performance is assessed through computational models (e. g. large scale finite element models) meta-modelling techniques have been developed in the past decade. This paper introduces adaptive kriging surrogate models to solve the RBDO problem. The latter is cast in an augmented space that "sums up" the range of the design space and the aleatory uncertainty in the design parameters and the environmental conditions. Thus the surrogate model is used (i) for evaluating robust estimates of the probabilities of failure (and for enhancing the computational experimental design by adaptive sampling) in order to achieve the requested accuracy and (ii) for applying the gradient-based optimization algorithm. The approach is applied to the optimal design of imperfect stiffened <b>cylinder</b> <b>shells</b> used in submarine engineering. For this application the performance of the structure is related to buckling which is addressed here by means of the asymptotic numerical method.

40|$|Abstract. We present {{calculation}} of the Casimir energy (CE) {{in a system of}} quantized electromagnetic (EM) field interacting with the surface of an infinite circular <b>cylinder</b> <b>shell</b> (defect). Interaction is described in the only QFT-consistent way by Chern-Simon surface action concentrated on the defect, with single coupling constant a. For regularization of UV divergencies of the theory we use Pauli-Villars regularization of the free EM action. The divergencies are extracted as a polynomial in regularization mass M, and they renormalize classical part of the surface action. We reveal the dependence of CE on the coupling constant a. Corresponding Casimir force is attractive for all values of a. For a → ∞ we reproduce the known results for CE for ideal conducting cylindrical shell first obtained by DeRaad and Milton.

40|$|Active {{structural}} acoustic {{control is}} a method in which the control inputs (used to reduce interior noise) are applied directly to a vibrating structural acoustic system. The control concept modeled in this work is the application of in-plane force inputs to piezoceramic patches bonded {{to the wall of}} a vibrating cylinder. The cylinder is excited by an exterior noise source [...] an acoustic monopole [...] located near the outside of the cylinder wall. The goal is to determine the force inputs and sites for the piezoelectric actuators so that (1) the interior noise is effectively damped; (2) the level of vibration of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>shell</b> is not increased; and (3) the power requirements needed to drive the actuators are not excessive. We studied external monopole excitations at two frequencies. A cylinder resonance of 100 Hz, where the interior acoustic field is driven in multiple, off-resonance cylinder cavity modes, and a cylinder resonance of 200 Hz are characterized by both near and off-resonance cylinder vibration modes which couple effectively with a single, dominant, low-order acoustic cavity mode at resonance. Previous work has focused almost exclusively on meeting objective (1) and solving a complex least-squares problem to arrive at an optimal force vector for a given set of actuator sites. In addition, it has been noted that when the cavity mode couples with cylinder vibration modes (our 200 Hz case) control spillover may occur in higher order <b>cylinder</b> <b>shell</b> vibrational modes. How to determine the best set of actuator sites to meet objectives (1) -(3) is the main contribution of our research effort. The selection of the best set of actuator sites from a set of potential sites is done via two metaheuristics [...] simulated annealing and tabu search. Each of these metaheuristics partitions the set of potential actuator sites into two disjoint sets: those that are selected to control the noise (on) and those that are not (off). Next, each metaheuristic attempts to improve this initial solution by calculating the change in the objective value when one selected actuator site is turned off and one actuator site that previously was not selected is turned on. All such pairwise exchanges are performed and the exchange that improves the objective the most is made. Eventually the search is unable to improve the objective value and a local optimum (with respect to pairwise exchanges) is reached. Both simulated annealing and tabu search provide mechanisms to escape local optima and allow the search to continue until (hopefully) a global optimum is found. Our experiments with the 100 Hz and 200 Hz cases confirm that both metaheuristics are able to uncover better solutions than those selected based upon engineering judgement alone. In addition, the high quality solutions generated by these metaheuristics, when minimizing interior noise, do not further excite the <b>cylinder</b> <b>shell.</b> Thus, we are able to meet objective (2) without imposing an additional constraint or forming a multiobjective performance measure. An additional observation is that in many cases the amplitude and phase values for several chosen actuator sites were nearly identical. This natural grouping means that fewer control channels are needed and the resulting control system is simpler. Currently no power requirements have been set, so objective (3) cannot be addressed. A set of experiments is planned with a laboratory test article (a cylinder). For these experiments the transfer matrices will be generated experimentally. It is hoped that the predicted performance of the best actuator sites found by our metaheuristics will correlate well with the measured performance...|$|E
