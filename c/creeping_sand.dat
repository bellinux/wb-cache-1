50|$|The beach, {{which was}} {{originally}} ultra pure fine white sand has been degraded by coarser sand washed ashore during attempts {{to reclaim the}} beach further north at Aspendale in the late 1970s. This reclamation involved pumping sand onto the eroding beach from far offshore. Unfortunately this off shore sand was much coarser and yellower being harder and grittier. It's clear today to see the progressive spread of this course sand now 3 km south of its original location. Other changes to the beach include the installation of sewerage to beach front properties in the 1960s when the entire dune was bulldozed, removing all native vegetation and razing {{what was once a}} protective mound. Introduced grasses were planted to hold the sand together and this eventually spread down to near the waters edge, producing what is seen today as a <b>creeping</b> <b>sand</b> dune covering the original beach with grass.|$|E

40|$|Barchan dunes can {{be found}} in sand barren regions under steady wind conditions. They {{translate}} {{in the direction of the}} wind while their shape remains unchanged. They have a minimal length in the order of ten meters, which renders laboratory experiments almost impossible. The length scale is set by the details of the sand-wind interaction. Smaller dunes do not evolve into the typical barchan dune shape. Our experimental approach produces dramatically scaled down barchan dunes. The idea is to modulate gravity by vertical oscillation of the sand bed. We produce small dunes that travel in the turbulent boundary layer of an open windtunnel. Particle image velocimetry on the surface of moving dunes reveals the flux of <b>creeping</b> <b>sand,</b> while measurement of sand grains flying through the air quantifies the key mechanism that moves sand by wind: saltation. While the amount of sand flying with the flow does not vary strongly in an oscillation cycle, the sand creeping over the dune surface is only in motion when the effective gravity is smaller than g. Thus, modulation of gravity provides a unique view on sand transport in wind. Saltation is an activation process, and we demonstrate the importance of turbulence.

40|$|One {{hypothesis}} for {{the origins}} of <b>creep</b> in <b>sand</b> is that heavily loaded grains may progressively crush following the growth of microcracks due to hydrolysis at crack tips. Weibull’s statistical model of brittle failure can accommodate these time effects. DEM simulations of the temporal deterioration of loaded grains are conducted using Robertson’s (2000) bonded agglomerates of microspheres to represent the grains. It is found that a particular relationship can be derived between the rate of loss of bond strength at a contact and the tension carried at that contact, such that the Weibull modulus of this rate-dependent model matches that of short-term loading tests on individual sand grains. The predicted grain strength decreases in a nearly linear fashion with the logarithm of time, which is in good agreement with results of ceramics obtained by Davidge et al. (1973).

The objective of the research is to highlight the socio-economic impacts of these phenomenons in the study area. Primary & secondary data were collected through interviewing & literature. The main findings of the research are; agriculture represents {{the main source of}} income despite the small size of the farms. The agricultural lands are shrinking year after year due to river bank erosion, sandy islands formation and <b>sand</b> <b>creep.</b> There is lack of government commitment to tackle the environmental issues. Moreover, farmers do not retain trees at their farms either due to ignorance of silvicultural operations as they represent or lack of seedlings and extension services at the study area. Palm trees are the exceptional tree that exists in the agricultural lands and present an additional source of income. Crop productivity shows a fluctuation pattern {{for the last three years}} and this was reflected in the high level of migration. The main conclusions drawn from this study are; the majority of the residents are either children or elderly people due to high level of migration. The stocking density of palm trees is declining in the study area particularly in areas subjected to river bank erosion.

40|$|Discrete element {{modelling}} (DEM) {{has been}} used to simulate creep in assemblies of spherical grains possessing an interfacial coefficient of friction that varies with sliding velocity according to rate process theory. Soil stiffness is represented by a pair of values of linear spring stiffness normal and tangential to each intergranular contact, and the limiting coefficient of contact friction is described as varying linearly with the logarithm of sliding velocity. DEM simulations of an assembly of 3451 spheres reproduce a number of significant phenomena including: creep rate {{as a function of the}} mobilisation of deviatoric stress; initially linear decay of creep strain rate with time plotted on log-log axes and with a slope m in the range 20. 8 to 21; and ultimate creep failure in triaxial simulations at high deviatoric stress ratios. Creep-induced failure is shown to occur at a unique axial strain for a given state of initial packing, and to be linked with dilatancy. The numerical results are compared quantitatively with the test data of soils from the literature.

40|$|While {{there exists}} a {{considerable}} body of theoretical and experimental work regarding the time-independent compaction and compaction <b>creep</b> behaviour of <b>sands</b> under near-surface and upper-crustal conditions where brittle processes are important, {{a number of important}} questions remain unanswered. In particular, the brittle failure behaviour of single sand grains is poorly understood at the microphysical level, and previous experimental studies performed on sand aggregates have not systematically investigated the effect of applied stress, grain size and chemical environment on either time-independent compaction or compaction creep behaviour. In addition, theoretical models for compaction of sands by time-independent grain scale cracking lack a true micromechanistic basis and no microphysical models have been developed for compaction of sands by timedependent grain scale cracking. The present study is concerned with the development of a fundamental understanding of the micromechanical processes controlling the compaction behaviour of sands under conditions favouring brittle and elastic phenomena. The approach adopted involves theoretical and experimental investigations into the failure behaviour of single sand grains and into the compaction behaviour of sand aggregates, and addresses both time-dependent and time-independent processes. The results help provide the understanding of the fundamental processes operating during sand grain failure and sand compaction needed for on-going progress towards micromechanically based constitutive relations suitable for modelling natural and man-induced deformations of both sands and sandstones...|$|R
40|$|Tailings are {{the waste}} {{products}} produced during {{extraction of minerals}} from the ore. The particle size of tailings varies from medium sand to silt or clay size. Tailings are used as a construction material for raising of embankments called tailings dams. During spigotting, the coarse particles (sands) lie close to the embankment, while the fine particles (slimes) move downwards to the impoundment. The rate of failure in tailings dams is higher than that for the conventional water dams. In the past, tailings dams have failed due to various causes such as meteorological incidents, slope instability, piping/seepage, weak foundations, and seismic liquefaction etc. The statistics shows that the tailings dams are not safe even in their construction stages. The closure and reclamation measures require that the tailings dams and impoundments should be stable {{for a long time}} (more than 1000 years). Hence, the proper understanding of the mechanical properties (i. e., permeability, stiffness and strength) of tailings is essential in order to make reliable predictions for the long time stability of tailings dams and impoundments. The purpose of the literature survey carried out is: (a) to understand the mechanical properties of tailings material regarding anisotropy, cyclic loading, particle crushing and creep effects; (b) to know the current design practice and identify the factors that may have strong influence on the long time stability of tailings dams and impoundments, and (c) to find from literature, an appropriate constitutive model that can predict realistic behaviour of tailings material. There is similarity in properties of coarse tailings and loose to medium dense natural sands. Slimes are complex material and may show resemblance to natural sands, clays, or a combination of both. The hydraulic conductivity of tailings varies from point to point in a deposit. Tailings are more compressible than the natural soils. The coefficient of consolidation of slimes is in the range shown by natural clays. Due to high particle angularity, the sands and slimes show higher drained shear strength than that for similar natural soils. Undrained strength of sands is important in evaluation of liquefaction behaviour. The embankments can be raised with upstream, downstream or centreline construction methods. The upstream method is susceptible to liquefaction, whereas the downstream and centreline methods are relatively seismic resistant. The stability of the tailings embankments can be enhanced by keeping the phreatic surface low within the embankment body. The phreatic surface can be lowered with the application of cores, drainage zones, and the use of sand tailings in the embankment construction. Cut-off trenches, slurry walls, grout curtains, and liners can control seepage in tailings dams. The pore water pressures develop during construction of tailings embankments. These pore pressures are described as initial static pore pressure, initial excess pore pressure, and pore pressure due to shearing. The stability analyses conditions for conventional water dams (such as end of construction, staged construction, and long term) are also applicable to the tailings dams. The end of construction condition, and staged construction condition of a tailings dam can be analysed with undrained strength analysis. The drained analysis can be used for the long-term condition of a tailings dam (when an embankment attains maximum height and is constructed slowly). The aim of reclamation measures for tailings dams and impoundments is to achieve long time mass stability, environmental safety, and productive land use. Tailings impoundments can be stabilized with ripraps, chemicals, vegetation, and dry/wet covers etc. Most natural soils show anisotropy in strength due to their depositional history. Due to low density and high degree of saturation, tailings show large cyclic strains in a few cycles of stress reversal. The cyclic strength of tailings can increase with decreasing void ratio. Creep occurs in all soils. Clays show more <b>creep</b> than <b>sands.</b> Loose <b>sands</b> <b>creep</b> more than dense sands. The loads due to high tailings embankments may cause particle crushing and creep. The long time stability of tailings dams and impoundments can be predicted with finite element analysis with suitable constitutive models.

40|$|On January 3 2004, the NASA Spirit rover {{landed on}} the plains inside the Gusev Crater in the {{southern}} hemisphere of Mars, and has made observations of the landing site and nearby region in visual and infrared wavelengths, as well as making in-situ measurements of rocks and soil. A number of rocks at the Gusev site are perched, with a significant undercut above the surface; additional rocks show a feature of being eroded or etched at a height of one to three centimeters immediately above the soil line. Some rocks also show terracing, and others show a two-tone pattern of albedo, with a distinct dividing line between a lighter area near the surface and a darker color above the surface. In {{a small number of}} cases, the dividing line is correlated with a visible horizontal groove in the rock, most likely indicating an earlier location of burial of the rock. A number of explanations for this undercutting are possible. Perched rocks can be placed on the surface by deflation of the soil from underneath the rock. The surface etching may be abrasion due to reptation. Reptation, or surface <b>creep,</b> occurs as <b>sand</b> moves without leaving the surface, as small (100 - 200 micron particles) moved by saltation set larger particles in motion. These large particles are effective at abrading the rocks at the surface level. The structure of "ripple" features at the site is evidence to support reptation at the Gusev site. An alternate explanation is etching at the surface by chemically active grit...|$|R
40|$|Subsurface {{exploitation}} of the Earth’s natural resources removes the natural system from its chemical and physical equilibrium. As such, groundwater extraction and hydrocarbon production from subsurface reservoirs frequently causes surface subsidence and induces (micro) seismicity. These effects are not only a problem in onshore (e. g. Groningen, the Netherlands) and offshore hydrocarbon fields (e. g. Ekofisk, Norway), but also in urban areas with extensive groundwater pumping (e. g. Venice, Italy). It is known that fluid extraction inevitably leads to (poro) elastic compaction of reservoirs, hence subsidence and occasional fault reactivation, and causes significant technical, economic and ecological impact. However, such effects often exceed what is expected from purely elastic reservoir behaviour and may continue long after exploitation has ceased. This is most likely due to time-dependent compaction, or ‘creep deformation’, of such reservoirs, driven by the reduction in pore fluid pressure compared with the rock overburden. Given the societal and ecological impact of surface subsidence, {{as well as the}} current interest in developing geothermal energy and unconventional gas resources in densely populated areas, there is much need for obtaining better quantitative understanding of creep in sediments to improve the predictability of the impact of geo-energy and groundwater production. The key problem in developing a reliable, quantitative description of the creep behaviour of sediments, such as sands and sandstones, is that the operative deformation mechanisms are poorly known and poorly quantified. While grain-scale brittle fracturing plus intergranular sliding {{play an important role in}} the early stages of compaction, these time-independent, brittle-frictional processes give way to compaction creep on longer time-scales. Thermally-activated mass transfer processes, like pressure solution, can cause creep via dissolution of material at stressed grain contacts, grain-boundary diffusion and precipitation on pore walls. As a first step to better describe <b>creep</b> in <b>sands</b> and sandstones, we have derived a simple model for intergranular pressure solution (IPS) within an ordered pack of spherical grains, employing existing IPS rate models, such as those derived by Renard et al. (1999) and Spiers et al. (2004). This universal model is able to predict the conditions under which each of the respective pressure solution serial processes, i. e. diffusion, precipitation or dissolution, is dominant. In essence, this creates a generic deformation map for any granular material. We have used our model to predict the amount and rate of compaction for sandstone reservoirs, and compared our predictions to known subsidence rates for reservoirs around the world. This gives a first order-comparison to verify whether or not IPS is an important mechanism in controlling reservoir compaction...|$|R
40|$|Time-dependent brittle creep {{plays a role}} in {{controlling}} compaction of sands and sandstones under upper crustal conditions, influencing phenomena such as production-induced reservoir compaction, surface subsidence, and induced seismicity. Brittle creep also {{plays a role in}} determining the mechanical behavior of gouge-rich faults. We performed uniaxial <b>creep</b> experiments on <b>sand</b> to investigate the effects of chemical environment (dry versus solution flooded), grain size (d= 196 - 378 mu m), and applied effective stress (sigma(a) up to 30 MPa), at room temperature conditions favoring grain-scale brittle processes. Creep measurements were complemented with acoustic emission (AE) detection and microstructural analysis to characterize the main creep mechanism. Wet samples showed much higher creep strains than dry-tested samples. AE event counts showed a direct relation between grain failure and creep strain, with higher AE rates occurring in the wet samples. Therefore, we inferred that time-dependent deformation was dominated by subcritical crack growth, resulting in grain failure accompanied by intergranular sliding rearrangements, and that crack growth in the presence of chemically active fluids was controlled by stress corrosion. The sensitivity of the compaction rate of the sands to d and sigma(a) can be expressed as (epsilon) over bar proportional to d(i) sigma(j) (a) where i approximate to 6 and j approximate to 21 under dry conditions and i approximate to 9 and j approximate to 15 under wet conditions. Our results were compared to a simple model based on Hertzian contact theory, linear elastic fracture mechanics, and subcritical crack growth.

40|$|Numerical {{triaxial}} simulations {{using the}} discrete element method (DEM) {{were performed to}} examine how the adopted contact models and the associated parameters affect the response. The increase in the shear modulus G in the Hertz-Mindlin’s contact model can enhance the small-strain Young’s modulus and reduce the initial volumetric contraction but the influence from the Poisson’s ratio, ν, {{used in the same}} model can be neglected. Samples with a higher interparticle friction coefficient, fs, give rise to higher shear strength and greater volumetric dilation. However, the associated peak and critical-state friction angles, ∅p and ∅cs, have a non-proportional relationship with increasing fs. The addition of rolling resistance can render a similar effect to increasing fs but enable the overall response, including the resulting ∅p, ∅cs, εp (the strain at the peak strength), and dilatancy behavior, closer to the experimental observations. As the rolling coefficient, Jn, and the coefficient of rotational sliding, η, increase, the ∅p and ∅cs also increase until they both reach a limit and become saturated. Moreover, the resulting ∅p and ∅cs from the samples with a fixed rolling resistance but different fs also show a similar non-proportional response as fs increases. When fs reaches a certain value, the failure is mainly by rotational sliding and not by frictional sliding because rotational sliding can occur more easily. Hence, the frictional resistance cannot be fully developed and ∅p (or ∅cs) ceases to increase no matter how much fs increase. Similarly, when η reaches a certain value, the failure switches into a frictional sliding mode so ∅p (or ∅cs) also stops increasing even as η continues to increase. In this study, DEM simulations on triaxial creep tests of dense and loose samples were carried out to examine the involved micromechanics during <b>creep</b> in <b>sand.</b> The simulated <b>creep</b> responses fairly reproduce the published experimental results. During the primary creep, the creep rate continuously decreases. This is due to that the contact forces are gradually transferred from decreasing tangential to increasing normal forces to form columnar particle structures. The columnar structures eventually completed formed and the creep rate reaches a minimum. However, the structures become meta-stable and are susceptible to buckling. This explains why a sand packing does not show an extended period of the secondary creep in the experiment. Buckling of the columnar structures also gives rise to maximum dilatancy and a sharp transition of the major fabric orientation from the horizontal to the vertical directions. The continuous process of buckling of columnar structures increases the creep rate and sliding ratios during the tertiary creep. In addition, the trend that contact tangential forces decrease while contact normal forces increase is reversed. Finally creep rupture occurs as the creep stress-strain line intersects the complete stress-strain curve. All the creep samples follow their original volume-change tendency to continue the dilation or contraction response during creep...|$|R
