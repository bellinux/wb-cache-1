40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research project is to design, develop and validate an innovative vehicle floor carpet system with improved acoustic performance, and thus reduce noise levels inside the vehicle cabins. The proposed solutions are expected to improve vehicle floor <b>carpet</b> <b>product</b> in areas of acoustic performance, cost, weight and waste reduction, to be environmentally friendly and sustainable in manufacturing. The following are main research outcomes of the project. • Acoustically improved vehicle floor carpet with higher sound transmission loss and in-cabin sound absorption coefficient, compared to current production carpet designs. • Vehicle floor carpet designs that introduce minimum weight and cost penalty for the acoustic performance improvement obtained. • Material database, i. e. measured acoustic parameters for mathematical modelling, of different vehicle carpet layers. • Virtual modelling and validation method for design evaluation at component and vehicle levels. • In-situ vehicle on-road validation test methods for carpet designs • Optimization methods for further improving the design The following are identified as recommendations for future design work in improving vehicle carpet acoustics. • Introducing air-gaps {{in the range of}} 10 mm in between the heavy layers by use of a honey-comb structure improves the transmission loss by up to 20 dB in the frequency range of 1 kHz – 2 kHz, and up to 10 dB in the frequency range of 500 Hz – 1 kHz, and achieves the best sound transmission loss in these frequency ranges. • The introduction of honey-comb structure as an air-gap structure does not add any over-head in terms of weight or thickness, compared to foam, nor affects the total absorption of the carpet system. • Special tuned absorber layers like the perforated facing foam Helmholtz resonator and the corrugated foil faced foam membrane absorbers are excellent in extending the noise reduction frequency ranges to specific low frequency ranges of interest...|$|E

It plans to enter China by selling its handmade carpets that are made in Iran. Furthermore, it wants to reduce its currency risk associated with its holdings in US dollars by investing in a Chinese office property. To integrate these two objectives, if feasible, MEX will take advantage of the business property as its office and establish a representative office in China. In this comprehensive report, we have first explored the opportunities and challenges involved with selling MEX?s handmade carpets in China. Our analysis employs the International Entry Modes Choice model and Porter?s 5 -forces model to present a structured evaluation of the many alternatives faced by MEX. Our final recommendation is for MEX to employ a differentiation strategy in marketing its handmade <b>carpet</b> <b>products.</b> Second, we integrate MEX?s real estate investment requirement with its location choice of its subsidiary office in China. Using research results from the literature and the real estate valuation model, we prepare the most appropriate choices for MEX from alternative cities, business districts, and buildings, by provding a list of target buildings on West Nanjing Road and in the Jingan Temple district in Shanghai.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the the present study(the Third Japan-Nepal Health Scientific Cooperative Study) was to {{investigate}} the health status of the Tibetan immigrants living in a Tibeta Refugee Camp located in the suburban district of Kathmandu in Nepal. They immigrated from Tibet more than 30 years ago, and have been habitually taking Tibetan tea which was made from rock salt, butter and tea as yet. A total of 548 (242 men and 306 women), aged from 20 to 85, participated in the study. Half of the men and two third of the women worked as weavers at a factory of Tibetan <b>carpet</b> <b>products.</b> Blood pressure of the men was 125 +- 21 / 78 +- 16 mmHg and of the women 118 +- 19 / 72 +- 13 mmHg, respectively, increased with age statistically.

Average salt intake was approximately 12 - 13 g/day, which was slightly higher than that of the Japanese. Although the Tibetan immigrants consumed relatively high amounts of salt, the association between salt intake and the blood pressure was not clearly detected by the partial correlation coefficients, suggesting that the blood pressure may be influenced by age, fat-free mass and the nutrient consumption rather than by the high salt intake in the Tibetan immigrants investigated...|$|R
