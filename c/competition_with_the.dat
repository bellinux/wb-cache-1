5|$|<b>Competition</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Palace Pier {{led to a}} new concert hall, {{designed}} by local architects Clayton & Black. The 19th century bandstand was demolished between 1914 and 1916. It was replaced by an eight-sided grand concert hall, constructed from cast-iron arches. It opened on 20 April 1916 with a concert by the King's Royal Rifles silver band, made up of war veterans.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} has been {{introduced}} outside its native range, but has not always become established, possibly due to <b>competition</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> house sparrow. It was introduced successfully to Sardinia, eastern Indonesia, the Philippines and Micronesia, but introductions to New Zealand and Bermuda did not take root. Ship-carried birds colonised Borneo. This sparrow has occurred as a natural vagrant to Gibraltar, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Israel, and Dubai.|$|E

5|$|The Hastings line {{is built}} over the difficult, forested, and hilly terrain across the High Weald and {{sandstone}} Hastings Beds, necessitating the construction of eight tunnels between Tonbridge and the south coast seaside resort of Hastings. The SER was anxious to construct the line as economically as possible, since it was in <b>competition</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> LBSC to obtain entry into Hastings and {{was not in a}} strong financial position in the mid 1840s.|$|E
5|$|The black currawong is {{evaluated}} as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. One of its subspecies, Strepera fuliginosa colei of King Island, {{has declined}} {{over much of}} its range on King Island, possibly due to clearing of its forest habitat, and has been listed as Vulnerable. There {{are estimated to be}} around 500 birds. It is unclear whether <b>competition</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> more numerous forest raven is impacting on the subspecies there.|$|E
5|$|By Vegas standards, the 75-seat {{restaurant}} is small, and the decor is understated, keeping {{the focus on}} the food.

5|$|Compared to the {{previous}} season's Claxton Shield tournament, there were few structural changes to the <b>competition.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> expansion from five to six teams, the need for teams to have a bye was eliminated, with all teams participating in games each round. The individual rounds were expanded from three to four games per round, resulting in an increase from 24 to 40 games per team for the season. The postseason was also expanded to include the top four teams, rather than only the top three.|$|E
5|$|<b>Competition</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> GCR on outer {{suburban}} {{services on}} the extension line saw {{the introduction of}} more comfortable Dreadnought Stock carriages from 1910. Ninety-two of these wooden compartment carriages were built, fitted with pressurised gas lighting and steam heating. Electric lighting had replaced the gas by 1917 and electric heaters were added in 1922 to provide warmth when hauled by an electric locomotive. Later formed into rakes of five, six or seven coaches, conductor rail pick-ups on the leading and trailing guard coaches were joined by a bus line and connected to the electric locomotive to help prevent gapping. Two rakes were formed with a Pullman coach that provided a buffet service for a supplementary fare. The Vintage Carriages Trust has three preserved Dreadnought carriages.|$|E
5|$|Cricket {{has been}} played in Hadspen, at Entally and grounds nearer the town's centre, {{since at least}} the 1860s. The cricket oval at Entally {{was one of the first}} in Australia and was hosting matches before Melbourne's foundation. During his side's 1874 tour of Australia the great English cricketer W. G. Grace played on the ground. Aside from cricket Entally's grounds were often open for picnics and grand annual events. The Hadspen Chieftains cricket club was formed in the 1987–88 season and plays as part of the Northern Tasmania Cricket Association. They won the association's A grade premiership in the 1991–92 and 1993–94 seasons, and the Charltons Cup Premiershipa {{combined}} <b>competition</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> North East Cricket Associationin the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s {{at the height}} of the Cold War, the United States Army {{conducted}} a classified feasibility study that proposed the construction of a manned military outpost on the Moon called Project Horizon with the potential to conduct a wide range of missions from scientific research to nuclear Earth bombardment. The study included the possibility of conducting a lunar-based nuclear test. The Air Force, which at the time was in <b>competition</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Army for a leading role in the space program, developed its own similar plan called Lunex. However, both these proposals were ultimately passed over as the space program was largely transferred from the military to the civilian agency NASA.|$|E
5|$|Found across Tasmania and Bass Strait islands, {{the green}} rosella {{is one of}} the commonest birds encountered. It also occurs on {{offshore}} islands such as Maria, Bruny, De Witt and Maatsuyker Islands. Its movements have not been much studied. Although possibly locally nomadic in places, the green rosella is sedentary; even birds at higher altitudes do not migrate. It has become rare on King Island, due to land clearing and possibly <b>competition</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> introduced common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) for nesting sites. During breeding season there it is restricted to the Pegarah forest, though may venture elsewhere at other times.|$|E
5|$|From the 1990s onwards, {{track and}} field became {{increasingly}} more professional and international, as the IAAF gained over two hundred member nations. The IAAF World Championships in Athletics became a fully professional <b>competition</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> introduction of prize money in 1997, and in 1998 the IAAF Golden League—an annual series of major {{track and field}} meetings in Europe—provided {{a higher level of}} economic incentive {{in the form of a}} US$1 million jackpot. In 2010, the series was replaced by the more lucrative IAAF Diamond League, a fourteen-meeting series held in Europe, Asia, North America and the Middle East—the first ever worldwide annual series of track and field meetings.|$|E

5|$|In 1835, {{there were}} eightday schools and three Sunday schools in New Sleaford and two daily schools in Old Sleaford. An infant {{school in the}} old playhouse on Westgate opened in 1855; Wesleyan schools {{attached}} to the chapel on North Street accommodated up to 200 pupils. In addition to private girls' schools, short-lived private schools for boys were established by Mr Herring and Charles Boyer in 1851, Henry Carruthers, and Edwin Reginald Dibben in 1870 in <b>competition</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> grammar school. Charles Kirk built a school and chapel at Quarrington in 1867. It became St Botolph's Primary School and in 2002 {{moved to a new}} site. In 1879, an art school was established in Duke Street in connection with the Science and Art Department; by 1896, two Wesleyan schools and a Catholic school were also in operation.|$|E
5|$|In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated acetyl {{chloride}} with sodium salicylate to produce acetylsalicylic acid {{for the first}} time; {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century, other academic chemists established the compound's chemical structure and devised more efficient methods of synthesis. In 1897, scientists at the drug and dye firm Bayer began investigating acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for standard common salicylate medicines, and identified a new way to synthesize it. By 1899, Bayer had dubbed this drug Aspirin and was selling it around the world. The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name, rather than the generic name of the drug; however, Bayer's rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to fierce <b>competition</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> proliferation of aspirin brands and products.|$|E
5|$|In about 1829, Samuel Miller and {{his brother}} John opened a store on the north {{bank of the river}} at the forks.

On June 2, 1829 Samuel Miller and Archibald Clybourn had been authorized to operate the first ferry across the Chicago River. Clybourn was the ferry man, crossing the North Branch of the river between Miller's tavern and the Wolf Point Tavern. In 1831 John Miller built a log house near his brother's tavern that he used as a tannery; Chicago's first recorded factory. Samuel Miller sold the tavern and moved away following the death of his wife in 1832.|$|E
