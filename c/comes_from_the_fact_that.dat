5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the night shark was published by Cuban zoologist Felipe Poey in 1868, {{as part of a}} series of papers entitled Repertorio fisico-natural de la isla de Cuba. He based his description on a single set of jaws and gave it the name Hypoprion signatus. In 1973, Leonard Compagno synonymized the genus Hypoprion with Carcharhinus. No type specimen has been designated for this species. Its common name <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it is mostly captured at night.|$|E
5|$|Karmal {{was born}} Sultan Hussein on 6 January 1929, {{was the son}} of Muhammad Hussein Hashem, a Major General in the Afghan Army and former {{governor}} of the province of Paktia, and was the second of five siblings. His family was one of the wealthier families in Kabul. His ethnic background is disputed, some claim that he was Tajik who represented himself as a Ghilzai Pashtun but others claim that he descended from Hindu ancestors of Kashmir. In 1986, Karmal announced that he, and his brother Mahmud Baryalay, were Pashtun because their mother came from the Mullakhel branch of the Pashtuns. However, this was controversial, considering that lineage in Afghanistan is supposed to be traced through the father, not the mother. The accusation that he was of Indian Muslim ancestry <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> his birthname, Sultan Hussein, is a common Indian Muslim name. In addition, Karmal's own father denied his own ethnicity; Karmal's father was a Tajik. To further confuse the matter, Karmal spoke Dari (Persian) and not Pashto.|$|E
5|$|Silver also forms alloys {{with most}} other {{elements}} on the periodic table. The elements from groups 1–3, except for hydrogen, lithium, and beryllium, are very miscible with {{silver in the}} condensed phase and form intermetallic compounds; those from groups 4–9 are only poorly miscible; the elements in groups 10–14 (except boron and carbon) have very complex Ag–M phase diagrams and form the most commercially important alloys; and the remaining elements on the periodic table have no consistency in their Ag–M phase diagrams. By far the most important such alloys are those with copper: most silver used for coinage and jewellery is in reality a silver–copper alloy, and the eutectic mixture is used in vacuum brazing. The two metals are completely miscible as liquids but not as solids; their importance in industry <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> their properties tend to be suitable {{over a wide range}} of variation in silver and copper concentration, although most useful alloys tend to be richer in silver than the eutectic mixture (71.9% silver and 28.1% copper by weight, and 60.1% silver and 28.1% copper by atom).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> name Erlun <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> area {{consists}} of two connected hills.|$|R

50|$|Reno Junction was {{originally}} called Rainbow. <b>The</b> present name <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>from</b> this point trains would head to Reno.|$|R
25|$|The {{factor of}} 3 <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the loop can be closed in three {{different}} ways.|$|E
25|$|Sayram {{was slowly}} rebuilt, likely {{with the support}} of the merchants of Central Asia and the {{leadership}} of the Kazakhs. This knowledge <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the city appears again as a target of Zunghar aggression forty years later.|$|E
25|$|Sobolev {{spaces are}} {{named after the}} Russian {{mathematician}} Sergei Sobolev. Their importance <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> solutions of partial differential equations are naturally found in Sobolev spaces, rather than in spaces of continuous functions and with the derivatives understood in the classical sense.|$|E
50|$|The village name {{is said to}} <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it was {{originally}} composed of nine and three quarter fields.|$|R
50|$|The {{common name}} Bath {{asparagus}} <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{it was once}} abundant {{near the city of}} the same name in England.|$|R
5000|$|... "Poo" [...] in Tamil means flower. [...] "Kollai" [...] in Tamil means {{garden or}} backyard. It is widely {{believed}} that <b>the</b> word Pookkollai <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> flowers for entire of town of Peravurani and nearby villages were supplied from Pookkollai.|$|R
25|$|Dr. X. – A mysterious {{character}} who evolves {{from being an}} illicit technology specialist and hacker to being a powerful Confucian leader and nefarious force. His name <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> most westerners cannot pronounce his Chinese name; he encourages people to instead call him by the first letter of his name, 'X'.|$|E
25|$|In {{dimensions}} {{higher than}} three, the densest regular packings of hyperspheres are known up to 8 dimensions. Very {{little is known}} about irregular hypersphere packings; it is possible that in some dimensions the densest packing may be irregular. Some support for this conjecture <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> in certain dimensions (e.g. 10) the densest known irregular packing is denser than the densest known regular packing.|$|E
25|$|Column 8 is a {{short column}} to which Herald readers send their {{observations}} of interesting happenings. It was first published on 11 January 1947. The name <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it originally occupied the final (8th) column of the broadsheet newspaper's front page. In a front-page redesign in the lead-up to the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000, Column 8 moved to the back page of the first section from 31 July 2000.|$|E

25|$|The major {{safety hazards}} of nitrous oxide <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that it is}} a {{compressed}} liquefied gas, an asphyxiation risk, and a dissociative anaesthetic.|$|R
25|$|Carrying out in-water {{recompression}} {{when there}} is a nearby recompression chamber or without special equipment and training is never a favoured option. The risk of the procedure <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a diver suffering from DCS is seriously ill and may become paralysed, unconscious or stop breathing whilst under water. Any one of these events is likely to result in the diver drowning or further injury to the diver during a subsequent rescue to the surface.|$|E
25|$|In {{the valley}} of Pilica river in Tomaszów Mazowiecki there is a unique natural karst spring of water {{containing}} calcium salts, that is an object of protection in Niebieskie Źródła Nature Reserve in Sulejów Landscape Park. The origin {{of the name of}} the reserve Niebieskie Źródła, that means Blue Springs, <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> red waves are absorbed by water and only blue and green are reflected {{from the bottom of the}} spring, giving that atypical colour.|$|E
25|$|The axioms {{of a group}} formalize the {{essential}} aspects of symmetry. Symmetries form a group: they are closed because {{if you take a}} symmetry of an object, and then apply another symmetry, the result will still be a symmetry. The identity keeping the object fixed is always a symmetry of an object. Existence of inverses is guaranteed by undoing the symmetry and the associativity <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> symmetries are functions on a space, and composition of functions are associative.|$|E

5000|$|The {{existence}} of the integers [...] and , and their uniqueness (mod [...] ) and (mod [...] ), respectively, <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that [...] is a representative set.|$|R
50|$|Russian President Vladimir Putin, {{during a}} {{televised}} debate, denied the mistrust in current security establishment: according to him, the direct subordination to <b>the</b> President <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> National Guard {{has the authority}} of a ministry, and as a power ministry it reports to the President.|$|R
25|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for more happiness among extraverts <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> extraverts are able to better regulate their affective states. This means that in ambiguous situations (situations where positive and negative moods are introduced and mixed in similar proportions) extraverts show a slower decrease of positive affect, and, as a result, they maintained a more positive affect balance than introverts. Extraverts may also choose activities that facilitate happiness (e.g., recalling pleasant vs. unpleasant memories) more than introverts when anticipating difficult tasks.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} the old Drybridge railway station and the village {{of the same name}} are nearby. The name 'Drybridge' <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> most bridges up until the era of the {{railways}} were built over watercourses and were therefore 'wet bridges'. A 'Dry bridge' was such a novelty that the name has survived ever since. This part of the railway is still active as the part of the Glasgow South Western Line (and officially known as the 'Burns Line') running from Kilmarnock to Troon.|$|E
25|$|For {{several centuries}} Lyon, capital of Rhône-Alpes, {{has been known}} as the French capital of gastronomy, due, in part, to the {{presence}} of many of France's finest chefs in the city and its surroundings (e.g. Paul Bocuse). This reputation also <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> two of France's best known wine-growing regions are located near Lyon: the Beaujolais to the North, and the Côtes du Rhône to the South. Beaujolais wine is very popular in Lyon and remains the most common table wine served with local dishes.|$|E

25|$|The name Småland ("small lands") <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{it was a}} {{combination}} of several independent lands, Kinda (today a part of Östergötland), Tveta, Vista, Vedbo, Tjust, Sevede, Aspeland, Handbörd, Möre, Värend, Finnveden and Njudung. Every small land had its own law in the Viking age and early middle age and could declare themselves neutral in wars Sweden was involved in, at least if the King had no army present at the parliamentary debate. Around 1350, in the reign of king Magnus Eriksson, the first national law code was introduced in Sweden, and the historic provinces lost much of their old autonomy.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} {{evolved from}} a community mural workshop in which the participants designed and painted the portable mural “Masks of God, Soul of Man” for the Bernal Heights Library. The group signed the piece as Precita Eyes Muralists because the project was a collaborative effort. The name of the organization <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> most of the muralists were from Precita Valley. Precita is a diminutive form of the Spanish word ‘presa,’ which means dam; the word ‘Precita’ means little dam. The ‘Eyes’ in the name are what we perceive the visual world with, our own eyes.|$|E
25|$|These {{sketches}} {{begin by}} announcing {{an activity that}} shouldn't be done whilst naked and assigning the activity a number. The sketches then depict one of the cast members performing the activity. The humour <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the activities are things that shouldn't be done at all, naked or otherwise such as eating a surfboard, towel whipping a bear or impersonating the Crazy Frog ring tone. According to the Season 1 DVD commentary, when Heath Franklin appears {{in one of these}} sketches he is the only actor to do his naked scenes in the nude, the rest of the cast wore flesh-coloured underwear.|$|E
