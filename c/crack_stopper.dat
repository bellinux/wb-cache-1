40|$|A {{recently}} proposed face-sheet/core interface crack {{arresting device}} is implemented in sandwich beams and tested using the Sandwich Tear Test (STT) configuration. Fatigue loading conditions {{are applied to}} propagate the crack and {{determine the effect of}} the <b>crack</b> <b>stopper</b> on the fatigue growth rate and arrest of the crack. Digital image correlation is used through the duration of the fatigue experiment to track the strain evolution as the crack tip advances. The measured strains are related to crack tip propagation, arrest, and re-initiation of the crack. A finite element model is used to calculate the energy release rate, mode mixity and to simulate crack propagation and arrest of the crack. Finally the effectiveness of the crack arresting device is demonstrated on composite sandwich beams subjected to fatigue loading conditions...|$|E

Structural adhesives {{are known for their}} high strength and stiffness but also for their low ductility and toughness.

In the present study, natural micro particles of cork were used with the objective to increase the ductility of a brittle epoxy adhesive. The idea is for the cork particles to act like a <b>crack</b> <b>stopper.</b> The influence of the amount of cork particles was studied. Particles of cork ranging in size from 125 to 250 孠were mixed in the epoxy adhesive Araldite 2020 from Huntsman. The amount of cork in the adhesive was varied between 0. 5 % and 5 % in weight. This evaluation was made using tensile tests and it was evident that the failure strain was related to the amount of cork particles in the resin. The results concerning the single lap joints and the glass transition temperature confirm the increased ductility obtained in the tensile tests. No Full Tex...|$|E
30|$|Nowadays, {{structural}} adhesives {{are increasingly}} being used for new applications, replacing conventional bonding methods. Epoxy resins {{are the most common}} structural adhesives used due to their suitable mechanical, thermal and chemical properties, despite their low ductility. In the past decades, several researchers have found it crucial to reverse these properties and find new ways to increase the ductility of these adhesives. The inclusion of particles (nano or micro) is an effective method to improve ductility of structural adhesives. In the present study, natural micro particles of cork are used with the objective of increasing the ductility of a brittle epoxy adhesive. The concept is for the cork particles to act like as a <b>crack</b> <b>stopper</b> leading to more energy absorption. The influence of the cork particle size, amount and the presence of a surface treatment were studied. The maximum strain of the adhesive was assessed through tensile tests. A Taguchi design experiments was used to understand the influence of each parameter under study (amount, size and presence of surface treatment) and their interaction. Through this research it was possible to settle that cork can improve ductility and cork amount, size and the use of plasma surface treatment have influence on the mechanical properties.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} of crack stop elements for carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) /foam core sandwich structures manufactured by using liquid composite moulding technology under fatigue loading. The novel <b>crack</b> <b>stoppers</b> consist of CFRP and they connect the face sheets. In this way, they are suited {{to be used as}} <b>crack</b> <b>stoppers</b> to decrease the face sheet debonding and as load introduction elements. Two types are investigated, a box section and a double-T beam. Quasi-static and cyclic Single Cantilever Beam (SCB) and Cracked Sandwich Beam (CSB) tests are run to evaluate their crack stop capability under global mode I and global mode II loading. The double-T beam shows the better crack stop effect. In the SCB test the box section increases the specimen durability by less than 2 %, whereas the double-T beam increases the load cycles to failure by a factor of 2. 7 to 447. In the CSB test, both <b>crack</b> <b>stoppers</b> {{have a significant impact on}} the crack propagation behaviour. The box section increases the durability by a factor of 11 to 95, and most of the double-T beam sandwich specimens sustained 3 million load cycles without global failure...|$|R

The processing technique consists of the spinning of blends of a thermoplastic (Ardel) with the LCP (PET/PHB 60).

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{mechanical}} investigation of 3 -D reinforced CFRP foamcore sandwich structures. Whereas the not reinforced sandwich carries ideally in plane loads, out of plane loads are critical. Therefore reinforcement elements like CFRP hollow profiles, CFRP double T-beam and CFRP pins in thickness direction are integrated in the sandwich {{and have to be}} benchmarked for effectiveness. For analyzing the material behaviour of the reinforced sandwich it is necessary to know the material behaviour of the not reinforced sandwich. Therefore firstly bending tests were conducted and the deformation and failure behaviour were investigated. Several failure criteria were tested by finite element calculation to describe the foam-core failure. It was possible to show, that the consideration of residual stresses increases the accuracy of failure prediction. For the investigation of the effectiveness of the reinforcement elements, special tests were defined and adapted for reinforced sandwich respectively: out of plane compression test, out of plane shear test and 4 -Point-bending test. The test results have shown, that both the stiffness and strength related to weight can be increased significantly with the reinforcement elements. Cracks in the sandwich are critical because they are not visible, if they are located in the foam or in the interface foam-skin. To decrease crack propagation <b>crack</b> <b>stopper</b> can be integrated in the sandwich. The potential of the load introduction (reinforcement) elements as crack stoppers needs to be analyzed. Therefore fracture mechanic tests like ENF and DCB were defined for the investigated sandwiches with and without reinforcement elements...|$|E

30|$|The {{interface}} between the particles and the adhesive {{is also a}} key factor in the reinforcement process [18]. A good wetting between adhesive and the particles, favouring a strong bond, should be guaranteed [20]. Therefore, particles will act as <b>crack</b> <b>stoppers</b> and not as defects on the matrix. Chemistry of the particle surface is very important, as it defines both the rate of wetting and the strength of interaction with the adhesive [18]. So, to ensure appropriate interfacial interactions, their surface properties must be modified accordingly. Often it is suggested that some degree of modification or treatment should be applied to all surfaces prior to adhesive bonding, {{in order to make the}} surface more receptive to the adhesive [21, 22]. In this study, plasma treatment was used to change the surface of the cork particles. Previous studies showed that the plasma treatment increases the wettability of the cork [21, 23].|$|R
40|$|High {{performance}} carbon fibre/epoxy composites, {{which are}} increasingly used for structural applications {{are susceptible to}} delamination. In response to this problem, the mode-I interlaminar fracture toughness of unidirectional carbon/epoxy laminates has been studied under tensile loading by using a double cantilever beam (DCB) specimen. The fracture energy is deduced from the data according to the area and the compliance methods. The morphology was explained through thermal analysis using DMA and fractography from scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed improvement in high temperature moulding compound (HTM) system with 180 °C cure in terms of interlaminar fracture toughness. There is also an improvement in MTM and LTM systems. SEM micrographs revealed their excellent delamination resistance as good <b>crack</b> <b>stoppers</b> with the evidence of strong fibre/matrix interface. For MTM systems GIc values dropped after post curing. This reduction was significant for MTM 49 - 3 {{but not so much}} in the case of MTM 49 - 7 laminate.

40|$|The interlaminar {{fracture}} behaviour of unidirectional carbon/epoxy composites {{has been}} studied under flexural loading by using end-notched flexure (ENF) specimens. GIIc values were calculated as total fracture toughness energy at the maximum load sustained by the materials as the delamination extended. The results showed that high temperature moulding systems (XHTM 45) have the highest GIIc values well above 1000 J/ m 2. For medium temperature systems (MTM), GIIc has also increased significantly after post cure. For compression strength after impact (CSAI), the behaviour {{to a certain extent}} is related to that found for GIIc tests. Comparison of the GIIc values with CSAI also indicated a relationship between two test results. SEM Micrographs revealed their excellent delamination resistance as good <b>crack</b> <b>stoppers</b> with the evidence of strong fibre/matrix interface. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) indicated the increased Tg and modulus retention of the LTM and MTM prepregs after post-curing at elevated temperatures. The failure mechanisms seem to be different for different tough matrix materials and appear to be strongly dependent on the cure and post-curing conditions. This is particularly noticeable for curing at 135 °C and 80 °C of medium and low temperature moulding systems...|$|R
30|$|The {{scope of}} {{previous}} studies in the literature has been dedicated to evaluating the effect of notches on the strength, fracture toughness, damage and failure mechanisms of both laminated (Awerbuch and Madhukar 1985; Callus 2007) and 2 D woven composites (Yudhanto et al. 2012 a, b). It was observed that the undulating nature of the woven fabric improves the delamination and splitting resistance compared to 2 D laminates as it helped in preventing crack propagation within the matrix and acted as <b>crack</b> <b>stoppers.</b> Thus, the notched strength of the 2 D woven laminates {{was reported to be}} higher than the laminated composites. In other words, 2 D woven composites were found to be less notch sensitive (Naik et al. 1990; Shembekar and Naik 1992). Replacing 2 D with 3 D woven composites helped in achieving further enhancement of the notched strength and fracture toughness, along the fibre direction, of composites as reported in (Cox et al. 1996; Tsai et al. 2000). The effect of the through-thickness binder in 3 D woven composites was clearly observed as a dramatic decrease in the notch sensitivity of 3 D woven composites and significant improvement of the fracture toughness and damage tolerance compared with those of 2 D woven laminates.|$|R

40|$|Glare {{laminates}} are {{materials that}} consist of alternating aluminium and glass prepreg layers especially designed for aeroplane structures. The {{result is a}} material that combines the properties of its constituents and the properties of a bonded structure. Some of the favourable characteristics of Glare are its fatigue, impact and fire resistance properties and the possibility to create tailored design solutions. After 25 years of development and extensive investigations within the aerospace environment, Glare is now ready to be applied for industrial production. It will be applied in {{large parts of the}} new Airbus A 380 fuselage, which is planned to have its first flight in 2004. This research describes the behaviour of Glare with holes that are made within production and the behaviour when the material is damaged due to an impact like for example a bird strike or an engine seperationf what creates cracks. These holes and this damage are regarded as blunt and sharp notches respectively. The failure mechanisms that were observed are investigated and function {{as the basis for the}} development of engineering calculation methods for the blunt and sharp notch behaviour of arbitrary Glare laminates.

40|$|In the {{competition}} to lower weight and production cost of aircraft structures currently two main approaches are competing: the metallic and the CFRP-layout. On the metallic site {{it could be}} shown that Laser beam welding (LBW) is a very promising way to overcome current limitations of a conventional riveted fuselage regarding reducing weight and production costs. LBW as a thermal joining process affects metal properties in difference to previous joining technologies. During the welding process the well designed microstructure in the parent sheet metal will be irreversible damaged and replaced by a cast microstructure. That affects the static strength of the weld joint, which will reach about 70 - 80 % of the base material. It will be shown in the experimental results that a laser beam welded butt joint has a higher crack propagation rate. To reach new damage tolerance requirements of the fusion zone in a butt welded joint condition, two ways are possible: 1. Reducing the stress intensity at the crack tip by using a socket around the fusion zone, to reduce the nominal stress at the {{cross section of the}} socket. 2. Changing the weld seam design with the aim of reducing the crack length inside the fusion zone. The goal of the work is to increase the damage tolerance of welded skin-skin joints. The paper presents the latest results of LBW butt joints of the alloy AlMgSiCu for sheets using modern lasers of very high beam quality (K> 0, 9). Special attention will be paid on the damage tolerance behaviour. To improve this, several approaches like influencing the macroscopic crack path, reducing the stress at the crack tip, the use of local working <b>crack</b> <b>stoppers</b> are used. These methods are compared concerning their ability the increase the crack propagation resistance of a welded structure to the high level of a non welded one...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{relationship}} between microstructure, fracturing behaviour and sound upon breakage was evaluated for four cocoa butter alternatives. Sound emission {{plays an important role}} in the sensory perception of snap, a key attribute for many chocolate and confectionery products. However, the correlation between microstructure, mechanical properties and the acoustic properties of fats used in the chocolate and confectionery industry has not been elucidated. SOS, PSO, PPO and POP rich fats were studied and characterised by SAXS/WAXS and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Simultaneous texture and acoustic analysis was conducted by the use of a texture analyser combined with an acoustic envelope detector system, augmented by a broad band microphone (2 - 200 kHz), and a digital sampling oscilloscope. A significant effect of triacylglycerol (TAG) composition on the sound pressure level upon breakage of fats was shown (p< 0. 05), whereas no effect of the crystallisation procedure was found. On the contrary, the maximum force at fracture was significantly affected by TAG-composition as well as crystallisation procedure. No significant correlation was found between force at fracture and the sound pressure level. A more detailed evaluation of force-displacement curves showed a high correlation between the negative values of the 2 nd derivative of the force curve, providing a measure of the rate of energy release upon breakage, and the sound pressure level (r= 0. 89, p< 0. 05), demonstrating a link between mechanical properties and acoustic emission. No relation between polymorphic behaviour, determined by x-ray diffraction, and the acoustic properties of fats was found. All fats was found to crystallised into the β’ phase within an hour storage at 20 °C and subsequently the PPO and POP rich fats transformed into the β form after 1 week. Further, analysis of the microstructure by confocal laser scanning microscopy showed no direct relation between acoustic properties and crystal size or crystal morphology. An evaluation of the strength of links within the fat crystal network, based on how orderly and dense packed crystals/crystal clusters appear on microscopic images, indicated an important role of the strength of inter-particle links for the sound emission, whereas intra-particle links were found to be less important. It is hypothesized that strong inter-particle links provide a strong rigid structure resulting in build-up of energy during compression and a fast energy release upon breakage accompanied by sound emission. The absence of large areas of liquid fat might also be important, especially when the contact areas between probe and sample is small, as such areas might act as <b>crack</b> <b>stoppers</b> providing local fracturing and preventing the build-up of energy...|$|R
40|$|To {{produce a}} better {{airframe}} design, {{it is imperative}} to investigate the problems of design and manufacturing integration early on at the conceptual design stage. A new design approach and support tool is required which will aid the designer in future product development. This is a particular necessity in the current context of increasing complexity and challenging economic situations. The present work focuses on the development of a design approach and design aids for designing metallic wingbox structures of low-subsonic transport aircraft with small wing sweepback angles. Its aims are two-fold: to assist in producing alternative structural concepts, and to capture the effects of new materials and manufacturing processes on weight and cost. It will form the basis for selecting the structural concept at the early stage of the design process. The target users of this design approach and tools are relatively inexperienced structural designers and students. The developed process and tools are quite general in their application as they use stand-alone modules which can be employed separately or jointly with existing techniques and tools used by industry, research centres and academia. A comparison of the result from the developed analytical tools against a detailed study undertaken by an aircraft company on the original configuration was made. It showed stress analysis and sizing results that were within a 10 % margin. A case study was performed to investigate the reduction of Direct Operating Cost (DOC) of a turboprop transport aircraft by redesigning the wingbox structure. Weight reductions of wing box structure of 16 % were achieved using new configurations and advanced metallic materials. The purchase price of the aircraft could also be reduced through use of cheaper labour and new manufacturing processes. These cost savings, if converted into DOC reductions, are only 0. 36 % of DOC due to fuel saving and 0. 25 % of DOC due to manufacturing cost reduction for the wingbox structure only. It is obvious that the overall DOC reduction {{is the result of the}} total impact of relative DOC effects due to fuel cost saving, material prices, labour rates, and manufacturing process improvements. Within the range of the calculated parameter values, the overall DOC reductions could be as much as 0. 61 % relative DOC. It appears that fuel prices, material cost and labour rates give greater impacts on DOC than high speed machining processes. Due to the use of advanced aluminium, maintenance cost is also predicted to be less. It has better fatigue life and fracture toughness than the standard aluminium and therefore will increase the aircraft maintenance periods for inspection and repair due to slower crack damage growth. This cost saving will contribute in reducing the life cycle cost of the aircraft. In addition, the number of <b>crack</b> <b>stoppers</b> could be reduced, therefore minimising weight and manufacturing cost. These benefits however have not been analysed.
