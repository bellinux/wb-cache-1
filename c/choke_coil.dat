25|$|These first {{loudspeakers}} used electromagnets, because large, powerful {{permanent magnets}} were generally not available {{at a reasonable}} price. The coil of an electromagnet, called a field coil, was energized by current through a second pair of connections to the driver. This winding usually served a dual role, acting also as a <b>choke</b> <b>coil,</b> filtering the power supply of the amplifier that the loudspeaker was connected to. AC ripple in the current was attenuated {{by the action of}} passing through the <b>choke</b> <b>coil.</b> However, AC line frequencies tended to modulate the audio signal going to the voice coil and added to the audible hum. In 1930 Jensen introduced the first commercial fixed-magnet loudspeaker; however, the large, heavy iron magnets of the day were impractical and field-coil speakers remained predominant until the widespread availability of lightweight Alnico magnets after World War II.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the size and robustness of the oscillator components, the lower frequency components were likewise robust. This is because a very large induced EMF occurs when the spark is struck, causing a strain on the insulation in the primary transformer. To overcome this, the construction of even low-power sets was very solid and a radio frequency <b>choke</b> <b>coil</b> or a resistor (R shown in this diagram) was necessary to protect the transformer or induction coil. The telegraph key (essentially an easy to operate on/off switch) many times had to carry large currents and high voltages and so it also was generally quite robust too.|$|E
50|$|Diesel rotary {{uninterruptible}} {{power supply}} devices (DRUPS) combine the functionality of a battery-powered or flywheel-powered UPS and a diesel generator. When mains electricity supply is within specification, an electrical generator with a mass functions as motor to store kinetic energy in an electro-mechanical flywheel. In combination with a reactor or <b>choke</b> <b>coil,</b> the electrical generator also works as active filter {{for all sorts of}} power quality problems, like harmonics, RFI, and frequency variations. When mains electricity supply fails, stored energy in the flywheel is released to drive the electrical generator, which continues to supply power without interruption. At the same time (or with some delay, for example 2 to 11 seconds, to prevent the diesel engine from starting at every incident), the diesel engine takes over from the flywheel to drive the electrical generator to make the electricity required. The electro-magnetic flywheel can continue to support the diesel generator in order to keep a stable output frequency. Typically a DRUPS will have enough fuel to power the load for days or even weeks in the event of failure of the mains electricity supply.|$|E

50|$|To power an HMI bulb, special {{ballasts}} {{act as an}} ignitor {{to start}} the arc, and then regulate it by acting as a choke. Two types of ballasts exist: magnetic and electronic (square-wave or flicker-free). Magnetic ballasts are generally much heavier and bulkier than electronic ballasts, as they consist primarily {{of a network of}} large inductors. They are usually cheaper than electronic ballasts. Since the magnetic type of ballast does not maintain the discharge continuously, the lamp actually extinguishes at zero-crossings of the mains waveform; unless the camera is locked to the mains waveform, the difference in frequency between the lamp and the shutter will produce a beat frequency that is visible in the resulting recording. This is why TV standards typically use the power grid frequency as their basic frame rate. Magnetic ballasts are simple devices compared to electronic ballasts. Essentially, a magnetic ballast is a large, heavy transformer coil that uses a simple principle to generate the high startup voltages needed to create an arc in a cold lamp. Input power is routed to a <b>choke</b> <b>coil</b> connected between the main input and the lamp. The coil may be tapped in several places to provide for various input voltages (120 V or 240 V) and a high start-up voltage. Capacitors are also included to compensate for the inductance of the coil and improve the power factor. Because of the high amount of current through the ballast, a low humming sound is often heard due to magnetostriction of the ballast iron laminations. Some magnetic ballasts have insulation around the coil for silent operation.|$|E

40|$|High-speed {{power line}} {{communication}} (PLC) systems {{have been developed for}} home networks. However, the transmission characteristics of an indoor AC mains line have not been clarified. We studied the influence of the appliance operation state on the transmission characteristics of the indoor AC mains line. The AC mains line and appliances were represented by four-port networks and two-port networks. The transmission characteristics were calculated by a model constructed with these networks. The two-port network parameters of the appliances were measured in both operating and stop states. The equivalent circuits were determined for both states based on the condition that the frequency characteristics of the circuits agreed with the measured value. A simple AC mains system was constructed and the transmission characteristics were measured to compare with the calculated value in various states. The results indicate that the calculated value agreed well with the measured one, and the transmission loss deviation resulting from the appliance state was within 10 dB.

Thus, the choke presents little inductance or impedance to differential-mode currents.
