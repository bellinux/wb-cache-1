40|$|The aim of {{the study}} {{presented}} in this article is to identify existing conflicts of land use and ownership in the 'Landwirtschaftszone', together with the problems arising therefore. This paper discusses determinants of farmland prices in Canton Zurich. A hedonic price model was used to estimate 1) the implicit value of an agricultural use of a land parcel, 2) the implicit value of the option to convert a farm parcel to a non-farm use and 3) the implicit <b>consumptive</b> <b>value</b> (value of owning land) of agricultural land. The analysis found farmland prices are influenced by agricultural production attributes as well as factors that influence the non-agricultural demand for land. In Canton Zurich, it can be assumed that economic development has already taken place in all communities in which it was possible. Its effect on farmland prices is therefore already manifested by influencing factors such as population density and the circumstances regarding land use. Once the new law on farmland became effective (1. 1. 1994), speculatory motives became much less a feature of land purchases. The weight of the factors determining price has thus shifted from "non-agricultural" to "agricultural". Arousing concern is on the other hand the fact that after 1994, the likelihood of transactions on good parcels located in economically strong communities has shrunk significantly. The ruling on maximum price may be responsible for the demise of the agricultural land market. The policy recommendations arising from the results relate both to the provisions of farmland legislation and to aspects of the law on space planning. In particular, innovations are proposed with regard to the keeping of price statistics, the terms of taking possession at income value and the definition of agricultural structures.

40|$|The bioeconomic {{analysis}} {{of endangered species}} without <b>consumptive</b> <b>values</b> can be problematic when analysed with density-dependent models that assume a fixed environment size. Most bioeconomic models use harvest as a control variable, yet when modelling non-harvestable species, frequently the only variable under control of conservationists is the quantity of habitat to be made available. The authors explore {{the implications of this}} in a model developed to analyse the potential population recovery of New Zealand's yellow-eyed penguin. The penguin faces severe competition with man for the terrestrial resources required for breeding and has declined in population to perilously low levels. The model was developed to estimate the land use required for recovery and preservation of the species and to compare the results to current tourism-driven conservation efforts. It is demonstrated that land may serve as a useful control variable in bioeconomic models and that such a model may be useful for determining whether sufficient incentives exist to preserve a species. However, the model may generate less useful results for providing a specific estimate of the optimal allocation of land to such a species. Land Economics/Use,...|$|E
40|$|Carcross {{woodland}} caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) numbers are increasing {{as a result}} of an intensive management and recovery program initiated in 1993. In the last 13 years, three overlapping First Nation land claim agreements were settled resulting in a complicated array of private and public land management authorities on this winter range, situated in the Whitehorse periphery. Twelve years of VHF radio-collar data (1994 - 2005) and 5 years of GPS radio-collar data (2000 - 2005) for female caribou were assessed to determine winter concentration areas and important winter habitats. We contrasted locations from 11 GPS radio-collared caribou with land cover classes, derived from classified Landsat 7 imagery, to evaluate the distribution and abundance of preferred habitats within this winter range. We found significant use of Open Needle Leaf lichen vegetation classes and avoidance of the relatively more abundant Closed Needle Leaf class. Our resource selection function model validated the preference for Open Needle Leaf Lichen and determined that caribou were spaced significantly further from an estimate of the human Zone of Influence (ZOI) than was expected from random locations. While our assessment determined that 64 % of the winter range was located outside of either private lands or land influenced by human activity, key winter vegetation classes were under-represented within this area. If caribou are to successfully recover on this landscape and persist through time it is essential to manage, through meaningful participation among land management authorities, the remaining caribou habitat for environmental rather than human <b>consumptive</b> <b>values...</b>|$|E

The {{management}} of internationally shared fish stocks {{is a major}} economic, environmental and political issue. According to international law, these resources should be managed cooperatively under international fisheries agreements (IFAs). This paper studies the formation and stability of IFAs through a coalition game that accounts for both direct <b>consumptive</b> <b>values</b> (harvesting profits) and non-consumptive values of the fish stock per se. The results show that accounting for non-consumptive values helps conserve the fish stock in that equilibrium fishing efforts are smaller and fish stock larger than without non-consumptive values under all possible coalition scenarios (full, partial and no cooperation). However, considering non-consumptive values {{does not affect the}} outcome of the game in terms of the prospects for cooperation: even with substantial non-consumptive benefits, the outcome is full non-cooperation. Hence, the trap of non-cooperation in international fisheries management cannot be overcome simply by explicitly accounting for non-consumptive values within IFAs.

40|$|The {{value of}} {{functional}} and biologically diverse landscapes to indigenous societies is increasingly recognised in public debates about development pathways but rarely rigorously assessed in development decisions. Using the replacement cost method, we quantify the direct <b>consumptive</b> <b>value</b> of aquatic species and sites for indigenous subsistence in three Australian tropical river catchments where negligible data exists on indigenous water {{values and the}} extensive use of wild resources for food, art, craft and medicines. The results establish a baseline for assessing and monitoring the socio-economic impact of hydrological and ecological changes from water resource development. More than 90 % of the gross replacement value in each catchment was accounted for by a small subset of high value species {{which could be used}} as integrated indicators of ecological and socio-economic change. The total value of species harvested was distributed across a large number of sites, justifying the need for a regional management approach to ensure the maintenance of diverse habitats for hunting and fishing.

40|$|Economic {{efficiency}} {{criteria are}} used to optimally allocate irrigation water in a closed river basin (Sevier River). The Basin is geographically divided into four subbasins. Liner programming model were developed {{for each of the}} four areas and used to generate value of marginal product schedules by parametric variation of water during the late irrigation season (after July 1). Differences in value of marginal product for average annual water deliveries were indications of a malallocation of late season water. A reallocation involving 28 percent of the restraining input (water) would increase net farm incomes (returns to capital, labor, and management) an estimated 10 percent. All water diverted to cropland, however, is not used consumptively by crops, but finds its way back to the river bia return flows and is available for rediversion downstream. Total consumptive use is a function of the number of times return flow from an initial acre foot of diversion can be rediverted. This assumes, a priori, an allocation should be based on a net stream depletion concept where <b>consumptive</b> use <b>values</b> for water are used. To accomplish this requires an economic-cum-hydrologic model which takes into account the physical response by crops to different amounts of water application and consumptive use plus the timing and amounts of water available during the hydrologic cycle.

Villagers, foresters, park employees, entrepreneurs and environmentalists were surveyed. The survey applied a multi-group social choice method, following six steps: (i) identification of all relevant social states for sustainable forest management; (ii) elicitation of preferences, for different social states, of forest user groups' members; (iii) determination of attributes of users and social states; (iv) aggregation of individual forest value preferences into social value preferences; (v) inter-group comparison of preferences; and (vi) estimation of predictors of social forest value preferences. A distinction is made between the household-perspective and the citizen-perspective of evaluations. As well, socio-economic and institutional-legal attributes of stakeholders were tested as predictors of stakeholder preferences. The major findings include the following. First, non-consumptive forest uses, including ecosystem services, were given highest priority by all stakeholders. Second, <b>consumptive</b> <b>values</b> were weighted more discriminately, while non-consumptive values were viewed more holistically. Third, forest dependence and environmental-resource-entitlements lead to more household consumption-based valuations; whereas, the appreciation of diverse forest values increases with the education of people. Fourth, the stakeholders exercise higher consensus {{on the importance of}} non-consumptive uses when such values are evaluated in the context of societal needs but not as household needs; consumptive uses registered the opposite effect. This finding signifies the separation between individual-conscience and social-conscience corresponding with the evaluation of consumer needs and societal needs, respectively.

40|$|Economic {{valuation}} of the Okavango Delta can support {{decision making in}} a complex socio-economic environment in which economic development depends on a deep understanding {{of the value of}} biodiversity. The use of a natural resource accounting framework in determining the value of goods and services is crucial. The total economic value of the Okavango Delta was estimated by using primary (household valuation) and secondary data. A natural resource accounting framework was used. The components of the total economic value were the composition of wild herbivores and vegetation, and the functional values, which comprised direct use values of wild herbivores, river reed, thatching grass, wild fruits, fuelwood and palm leaves, indirect <b>consumptive</b> <b>values</b> of honey production, carbon sequestration, livestock grazing, milk production, non-consumptive use of tourism, and existence and bequest values. The values of the composition and function are expressed in per/ha values. The value of the composition of wild herbivores was estimated at P 1 444 992 400 (US$ 294 850 699. 2) or US$ 27. 4 /ha, while the functional value was estimated at P 185 913 117. 4 (US$ 37 527 840. 96 or US$ 619. 77 /ha. Of the estimated direct use values of vegetation, river reed had the highest value of US$ 29. 0 /ha, while the highest value among indirect use values was that of milk production (US$ 8. 5 /ha). These values of selected resources reflect the contribution of the value of biodiversity of the Okavango Delta to the overall economy of the country and represent initial estimates of costs to society if these resources are lost. The estimated values can be used to raise awareness among decision makers of the economic benefits of conserving the Okavango Delta. Overall, the findings showed that the various components of the total economic value of the Okavango Delta were comparable to other wetlands in the region.

40|$|Abstract Previous {{research}} {{proposes that}} human beings are motivated to protect endangered species for various reasons: <b>consumptive</b> use <b>value,</b> non-consumptive use value, non-use value, and intrinsic value. However, it has been difficult to tease apart these values at the behavioral level. Using an innovative fishing game, we study an important tradeoff between one kind of use value (monetary value) and one kind of non-use value (existence value) of the endangered Steller sea lion. In the fishing game, players make repeated decisions on how much pollock to harvest for profit in each period in a dynamic ecosystem. The population of the endangered sea lion depends on the population of pollock, which in turn depends on the harvesting behavior of humans. The data show that in general, people responded to the financial value (as a tourist resource), but not the existence value, of the sea lion by cutting down commercial fish harvesting to keep more sea lions in the ecosystem. However, not all people behaved the same regarding the existence value. Females displayed a higher existence value than males, as did people who reported stronger pro-environmental attitudes than those with weaker pro-environmental attitudes.

40|$|Papyrus swamps form {{ecological}} buffer zones at the land-water interface, protecting lake shallows from sedimentation {{and reducing the}} risk of eutrophication in open water. Many communities living near papyrus swamps, particularly in East Africa, derive socioeconomic benefits from these highly productive ecosystems. Loss of the buffering capacity of papyrus at Lake Naivasha, Kenya, explains much of the observed increase in the lake’s trophic state. Multiple authors have called for Naivasha’s wetlands to be restored; however, the social and ecological factors that would need to be considered before doing so have received insufficient attention. Case studies of recent restoration programmes at Lake Victoria illustrate the means by which degraded wetlands can be rehabilitated. Analysis of attitudes towards papyrus at Lake Naivasha reveals a general lack of awareness surrounding the benefits of local wetlands, forming a potential barrier to successful restoration there. An assessment of the lake’s riparian zone demonstrates that both anthropogenic and natural pressures present significant challenges for the survival of lake-fringing wetlands, highlighting changes that have occurred within the ecosystem over the last few decades. Potential means of addressing both the social and ecological limitations to papyrus restoration are offered, with explicit linkages to the benefits of doing so made clear. Floating islands are shown to be the most appropriate reference for ecological restoration at Lake Naivasha, which can be replicated through artificial technology. The establishment of a <b>consumptive</b> use <b>value</b> for harvested papyrus at Naivasha would help to raise stakeholders’ awareness of wetlands; a novel means of producing biomass briquettes was met with positive responses from local residents and may be used to encourage community participation in restoration.

40|$|To redress past {{discrepancies}} in land tenure, the ANC government acknowledged that land {{needs to be}} made accessible to the previously disadvantaged, announcing that commonage would be a pillar of their land reform programme. Municipal commonage is land granted by the state to municipalities for urban households to use. Presently many urbanites in South Africa seek a livelihood from commonage. However, there has been no livelihood valuation of the contribution commonage makes to previously disadvantaged households. Thus {{there is a need to}} calculate the benefits of the commonage programme. Through a two phase approach, this thesis investigated firstly, the proportion of township households which use commonage; and the main characteristics of those households. Secondly, the thesis looks at the extent to which commonage contributes to users' livelihoods and the dominant livelihood strategies pursued by user households. Data was collected for three towns in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa; Bathurst, Fort Beaufort, and Grahamstown. Firstly it was found that between 27 - 70 % of households used commonage, with the largest town having the lowest proportion of users, and vice versa for the smallest town. In terms of household characteristics, each study town was unique. Both Bathurst and Grahamstown user households were poorer than non-using households, however all Fort Beaufort households were considered poor. To assess the benefits of the commonage programme, the marketed and non-marketed <b>consumptive</b> direct-use <b>values</b> of land-based livelihoods on commonage were calculated via the 'own reported values' method. Commonage contributions to total livelihoods ranged between 14 - 20 %. If the contributors from commonage were excluded, over 10 % of households in each study town would drop to living below the poverty line. Additionally, commonage was being used productively, with the productivity at each study town being worth over R 1 000 per hectare and over R 4. 7 million per commonage. Finally, a typology of subsistence/survivalist commonage users is presented, with four types being identified. Overall, results suggest that commonage use has increased over the last decade. Moreover, due to food inflation and urbanisation the use of commonage is expected to increase further, highlighting the need for holistic commonage management plans to be created, which should include strategies such as sustainable grazing regimes and natural resource management.

Only 15 % {{of the total population}} has portable water (Ijara district strategic development plan 2002 – 2008). Besides River Tana, Lakes Jerrei and Hadhi, Ijara has 20 water pans. Water availability tackles farmer-pastoralist conflicts which in turn curtails ecosystem degradation due to unplanned watering points. Other water challenges include, siltation, degradation of water pans resultant to poor management (GOK 2008). The water pan presented impacts costs to include acquisition of land, steep capital outlay, attracting informal settlement around it and possible emissions from the many livestock and wild game that congregate around it daily. These are some of the benefits and costs that the study assessed to ascertain economic viability of the adaptation strategies in use. Although water needs in Ijara are acute specifically for livestock, domestic and crop farming, the study explored broader economic water values as use values are inter-linked. The values were generally classified as use and non-use values. Within use values, there were direct (consumptive e.g. irrigation) or (non-consumptive e.g. water for aesthetic). Non-use values (existence, bequest, philanthropic) were of ethical concerns and altruistic preferences stemming from self-interest and non-direct use values (Kerry et al. 2004). Of greater interest in Ijara was <b>consumptive</b> water use <b>value</b> given its scarcity and high demand for livestock, domestic and subsistence crop farming. Currently that demand is met by 20 water pans constructed over the years largely through external aid complemented by labour and goodwill from local community.

The majority of federal lands is grazed by domestic livestock, a consumptive resource use. Communities have evolved dependent on traditional consumptive uses. Recently, non-traditional users today have contested public land management decisions and these users have become strong advocates for changes in our existing public land policies. Several grazing policy changes have been discussed in this policy debate. Changing public land policy means changing the allocation of economic resources on regional and local levels. Very {{little is known about}} the public land rancher, confounding analysis of policy impacts. Past research suggests that ranchers are very heterogeneous in terms of individual rancher characteristics and their economic behavior ranges on a continuum from ranching for personal consumption to that of a more classical profit maximizing firm. A survey instrument was designed to collect demographic and socioeconomic data and discrete responses to proposed policy changes. The policy changes examined include increases in the grazing fee, reductions in permit size, and elimination of seasons of use. Cluster analysis was used to identify groups across a spectrum of preferences from consumption of the ranching lifestyle to classic profit maximizing behavior. Eight distinct groups emerge exhibiting a broad range of profit preference. Ranchers' discrete responses to policy change scenarios were then modeled using a Random Utility Model (RUM). Determinants modeled include relevant socioeconomic attributes and the rancher specific opportunity cost of the policy change in question. The results from the RUM suggest that ranchers do <b>value</b> <b>consumptive</b> uses and that typical profit maximizing behavior cannot be expected across all ranchers. Both analyses present similar policy implications. Both show that increasing the grazing fee a small amount would likely have very little affect on the status quo. Also, both results show the heterogeneity of ranchers across the west and their economic irrationality in the face of policies that increase ranching costs...|$|R

Like in many {{developing}} countries, forest and woodland resources contribute significantly to ensure the sustainability of livelihoods of rural people of Eritrea. However, the contribution made by forest and woodland resources has been masked due to {{the inability of the}} traditional economic valuation methods to reveal the hidden values of forest resources. As a result they do not reflect in GDP accounting, development planning and conservation policymaking. The underestimation of the importance of forest and woodland resources to the rural subsistence economy results in both market and policy failures. These in turn lead to escalated forest degradation, livelihood insecurity, value conflicts and ineffective conservation programmes. The forest and woodlands of administrative sub-zone Dighe were selected as a case study as they comprise trees, shrubs and other non-woody plants of outstanding importance both in terms of socio-economics and biodiversity richness. However, these resources are being rapidly depleted as a result of clearing for commercial agriculture and are under growing pressure due to resettlement of returnees and needs of other social actors. The study was carried out in three representative administrative areas of the sub-zone. A literature survey was carried out to identify the best of traditional neo-classical economic valuation methods to use in this study. Complementary methods from various streams of economics, ethnobotany, ecological anthropology and rural sociology were reviewed. The sub-set of selected marketable items were quantified and monetised based on market-based valuation approaches; and compared with non-marketable roles to indicate the magnitude of full values of the forest and woodland resources. Values that could not be quantified were described qualitatively. A production-consumption analysis of dom palm scrub leaf harvesting for household utensils was carried out. Forest health was investigated based on observation, semi-structured interviews and secondary information. The study revealed that local forests and woodlands provide essential goods and services for subsistence use, to generate income and to reduce vulnerability during times of hardships. Riverine forests, acacia woodlands and scattered trees and shrubs of grassland are the three vegetation types found in the study area. The riverine forest, dominated by dom palm, is a most valuable resource as it provides for multiple uses. Among the many marketable and non-marketable benefits, forests and woodlands provide wild food, construction material, livestock feed, household utensils, firewood, traditional medicine, shade, climate amelioration, erosion control, cultural heritages and scenic values. All members of rural households regardless of age, gender and wealth extract forest products, which minor variation between households and administrative areas. Variability of <b>consumptive</b> use <b>values</b> between households and between administrative areas and other non-marketable values are determined by relative wealth status, seasonality, resource availability and distribution, market outlets and local institutions. The study revealed that the riverine forests and woodland values of the Dighe administrative sub-zone alone have contributed economical values many times greater than US $ 1. 43 million per annum for selected quantifiable items only. This would be higher if the other non-marketable forest values were monetised including the livestock grazing and access to watering points. Beyond any doubt, the high local values of forest and woodlands and consequently the contribution to the national economy justify the conservation of the remaining forest. Moreover, the production-consumption analyses showed that the present level of dom scrub leaf harvesting is sustainable. Forest health situation analysis indicates, however, that the entire forest is under immense pressure. Moreover, {{the findings of this study}} suggest that conserving forest resource for local values is compatible with the millennium global development agendas...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} water-supply planning {{problem is}} characterized by two main steps: (1) project future water requirements based on present rates of economic growth, 'and (2) schedule water development projects to be introduced into the system on time to meet these predicted requirements. If alternative projects are thought to exist, the one thought to cost the least amount is selected. As project costs rise and actual new water availabilities become less, {{there is a growing}} awareness that more new water is not necessarily the only answer. Increased efficiency in water use through conservation, reuse, transfer to less <b>consumptive</b> and higher <b>valued</b> applications, and improved management techniques are becoming practical alternatives. These alternatives lead to a need for a restatement of water-supply planning objectives in more precise forms than have heretofore been put forth. The various water- supply planning objective functions including the traditional one are all expressions which maximize the difference between gains and los se s involved with water development. They can be expressed mathematically and differentiated on the basis of how these gains and losses are defined. In the traditional sense, gains derived from meeting projected requirements are assumed to be infinite, and losses are taken to be actual project costs; therefore, maximization of net gains is accomplished by minimizing project costs and gains do not even have to be expressed. Consideration of alternatives, however, requires that gains be expressed quantitatively as benefits to individuals, communities, or regions, i. e., primary, secondary, or tertiary benefits. The same thing holds for the expression of total costs. An objective function used to express the water-supply problem in the Tucson Basin, Arizona, considers gains as cash revenue to a hypothetical central water-control agency which sells water to the users within the basin. Losses are considered as marginal costs to the agency for producing, treating, and distributing water. The concept of economic demand is used to estimate the amount of water that municipal, agricultural, and industrial users will purchase at different prices. The possible sources of supply considered are groundwater from within the basin, groundwater from the neighboring Avra Valley Basin, reclaimed waste water, and Central Arizona Project water from the Colorado River. Constraints are formulated in order to determine optimal allocations of water under different conditions. The model used is referred to as a pricing model and is optimized by first decomposing the objective function into component parts, each part representing terms involving only one source of water. Then in instances involving inequality constraints, quadratic programming is used. In other instances where equality constraints or unconstrained conditions exist, Lagrangian multipliers and the calculus are used. The se latter conditions arise when it is determined at which point certain constraints become inactive. In the completely general case, this type of decomposition is not possible, but it appears that in many specific uses objective functions of this nature can be profitably decomposed. and optima determined much more conveniently than otherwise possible...|$|R
40|$|Beginning {{with the}} total {{protection}} of the beaver (Castor fiber) in Norway in 1845, beaver management has undergone numerous changes as population development, resource exploitation goals and management objectives have evolved. Presently, new beaver management by-laws are being developed. This report briefly summarizes {{the historical development of}} beaver management in Norway, reviews the recent literature of particular relevance for the development new by-laws and makes recommendations for the future improvement of beaver management. The main goals of beaver management are to maintain populations throughout their natural range at densities sufficient to enhance biodiversity, produce a harvestable surplus and reduce beaver-human conflicts. In addition, beaver management should optimize recreational opportunities for the public and economic opportunities for landowners, e. g. through the lease of beaver hunting. These often opposing objectives sometimes lead to conflict. The beaver has been an important source of fur, food, and castoreum (as medicine) for the inhabitants of Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden and Finland) and northwest Russia for millennia. While beaver were completely extirpated from Sweden, Finland and northwest Russia in the late 19 th century, a remnant population of 100 - 200 beaver survived in southeast Norway. Following alternating periods of protection and exploitation the population grew slowly. In 1932 the effective leg-hold trap was forbidden in Norway. Live-trapping and hunting with firearms in autumn were still allowed but proved ineffective for controlling populations. With damage complaints increasing, in 1981 the open season was extended to early May. Spring hunting, i. e. with firearms, improved hunting efficiency and has gradually become the main harvest form. Thus the <b>consumptive</b> <b>value</b> of beaver has transformed from commercial furbearer to recreational game species. This same transition to spring hunting has also developed in neighboring Sweden and Finland. Norwegian beaver management is better understood in light of two basic fundaments of Norwegian wildlife management. 1) All wildlife is publicly owned, and therefore wildlife management should seek to maximize the public’s enjoyment and utilization of wildlife. 2) The hunting privilege belongs to the landowner. Once public authorities have determined when, where and how much game can be harvested, landowners can either hunt themselves or lease the hunting rights to others. In the later case, wildlife becomes a source of income to landowners while providing hunting opportunities for the general public. Most of the details of practical beaver management may be found in the “Wildlife Act”, its accompanying by-law for beaver management (by-law FOR 2002 - 03 - 22 nr 314 : Forskrift om forvaltning av hjortevilt og bever), and the by-laws defining the open seasons for hunting and trapping (by-law FOR- 2012 - 03 - 01 nr 190 : Forskrift om jakt- og fangsttider samt sanking av egg og dun for jaktsesongene fra og med 1. april 2012 til og med 31. mars 2017) and the hunting and trapping methods allowed (by-law FOR 2002 - 03 - 22 nr 313 : Forskrift om utøvelse av jakt, felling of fangst). These laws outline when, where and how beaver can be trapped and hunted, the organizing of landowners into beaver management units, and how hunting quotas are determined and distributed among landowners. With the exception of an acute need for control of damage and alien species, 4 trapping and hunting are not allowed during the breeding season, though what constitutes the breeding season is not clearly defined in the “Wildlife Act”. This lack of clarity has recently been the cause of some debate concerning when the breeding season for beaver actually starts, and therefore when spring beaver hunting should cease. Harvesting to conserve, manipulate and exploit beaver populations is a central element of Norwegian beaver management. Quota regulation of the harvest has been continually employed since 1855, at which time landowners were also granted the exclusive right to hunt beaver. At present, municipal wildlife managers first decide whether the local beaver population can be harvested based on population information gathered from e. g. landowners, hunters, or autumn counts of occupied lodges. A harvest quota for the entire township is then established and divided among landowners according to how much beaver habitat they own. The amount of beaver habitat on a particular area or estate can be measured in two different ways; either as the area of “beaver habitat” or the length of “beaver-utilized shoreline”. Beaver habitat includes all habitat normally used by beaver; i. e. forest, bog and agricultural landscapes below tree line, usually excluding urban areas, larger lakes and steep mountain hillsides. “Beaver-utilized shoreline” is the length of shoreline in rotational use by beaver, since shoreline habitat presently in use and later abandoned, will normally be reoccupied again at some future time. In order to distribute the municipal quota among landowners, the minimum area necessary to receive one beaver permit is determined by dividing the total area of beaver habitat in the municipality by the municipal quota. Alternatively, the minimum shoreline length necessary is determined by dividing the total length of beaver-utilized shoreline by the municipal quota. Municipal managers may choose between the two alternatives, though the length of beaver-utilized shoreline on an estate is the best predictor of colony density when the area involved is relatively small (Fig. 1). Reliable data on the length of beaver-utilized shoreline in a municipality, however, is more difficult to obtain than the area of beaver habitat. To receive their portion of the municipal quota, landowners must first organize beaver management units. Because Norwegian estates average small (≈ 50 hectares), landowners must usually group together in order to attain the minimum area necessary to receive a quota of at least one beaver. Typically, the minimum area required to receive one beaver would be 300 - 500 hectares. Thus beaver management units almost always entail many landowners, creating challenges with respect to e. g. landowner cooperation and organization. Once organized and approved by the municipal authorities, each beaver management area is allotted its portion of the total municipal quota based on the relative amount of beaver habitat or beaver-utilized shoreline it encompasses. Management areas too small to meet the required minimum area or minimum shoreline length do not receive a quota, which serves to motivate landowners to merge into larger units. Management units for cervids (moose Alces alces, red deer Cervus elaphus and roe deer Capreolus capreolus) in most instances also function well as management units for beaver, though usually not in farmland. This is because most management units for cervids do not involve farmland, though farmland is usually good habitat for beaver. The present national distribution of beaver (Fig. 2) extends from mid-Norway south through the eastern and southern counties. As of 2003, Troms and Finnmark no longer have beaver, despite several releases of new animals in recent decades. The national population size is thought to be about 70, 000 individuals and still growing. On a scale of 5 about 200 - 500 km 2, newly established populations appear to peak after 35 - 40 years, followed by an abrupt fall (phase 1, Fig. 3). This pattern closely mimics the Riney-Caughley model for introduced ungulates. Populations are thought to eventually enter a more stabile carrying-capacity phase (phase 2, Fig. 3). Over-browsing is thought to be the main cause of the initial abrupt decline (Fig. 3). Though information is limited, colony density seems to vary considerably between landscape types, being greatest along low-gradient rivers and in farmland, and least in alpine regions (Table 1). A suggested mean colony density for all landscapes combined (excluding alpine) once populations have stabilized is 0. 25 colonies per km 2, or one colony per 4 km 2. A central goal of the “Wildlife Act”, the “Nature Diversity Act”, and of Norwegian forest owners is the conservation of biodiversity at the genetic, species, landscape and ecosystem levels. As an ecosystem engineer, beaver physically change the landscape primarily through dam-building and tree-felling, significantly modifying the geomorphology, hydrology, ecological succession and species composition of the landscape. Locally however, species biodiversity may temporarily decline. Modern clear-cut forestry, though detrimental to many wildlife species, may actually benefit beaver by stimulating the shoreline growth of broadleaf species favored by them. Municipal wildlife managers are required to arrive at a municipal beaver quota, which requires information on population size. Since sites occupied by beaver are highly visible in autumn, information is usually gathered then. Population size is usually expressed as number of colonies rather than number of beaver, as the number of beaver in each colony is difficult to determine. When an estimate of the actual number of animals in the population is necessary, a mean colony size of 4 is usually employed for the Eurasian beaver. Five methods used to estimate population size on a municipal scale are briefly described in this report. Reliable harvest information is important for population management. The national beaver harvest figures for 1984 - 85 – 2010 - 11 (Fig. 4) reveal an unexpected pattern consisting of an initial 3 -fold increase the first 5 years, followed by a gradual 3 -fold decline and leveling-out. During this same period, the range of the beaver throughout Norway has slowly expanded and presumably the population size as well. Therefore a gradual increase in the national harvest would also be expected, but for some reason the data indicate a decline. From 1985 -|$|R
