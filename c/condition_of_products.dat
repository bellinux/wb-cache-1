A literature study was conducted to identify the STM systems’ cornerstones and the value-adding supply chain information types. Interviews with logistics managers of Swedish industrial and retailing companies were conducted to evaluate how much visibility of different SCITs is affected by using the STM systems. The visibility of information regarding the location of products in supply chain and <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> in shipment has the largest support from the STM systems out of the interviews with the logistics managers...|$|E
30|$|Norman [6] pointed that “there is {{on other}} {{distinction}} among the levels: time. The visceral and behavioural levels are about “now,” the feelings and experiences while actually seeing or using the product. But the reflective level extends much longer – through reflection {{you remember the}} past and contemplate the future. Reflective design, therefore, is about long-term relations, about the feelings of satisfaction produced by owning, displaying, and using the product.” Beyond the design of an object, there is personal component that no designers or manufacturers can provide. Reflective attachment is personally given by users {{and more likely to}} produce emotional durability. Emotional attachment is not determined by a certain <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>products,</b> but it defined by willingness of users to perceive, reflect, and give meanings to products.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{entertainment}} {{industries are}} experiencing above-normal economic growth. Yet, industrial dynamics as, for example, innovation is neither well-described nor analysed {{in the context}} of the particularities of these industries. The specificity of the industries proliferates from the close relation between the sphere of business and the sphere of the artistic. Using the music industry as an illustration, the paper deals with the concept of innovation. The paper looks both at innovations within the industry as such; technological and organisational changes but also at the tension between creativity and innovation as novelty. More precisely, by outlining Schumpeters notion of innovation and relating it to certain characteristics and <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> created in the music industry, it is concluded that a Schumpeterian concept of innovation is to narrow to capture the wide range of changes in the music industry especial regarding matters of artistic change...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{incentives}} of pharmaceutical firms to generate scientific knowledge through clinical trials {{and how these}} incentives are affected through different regulatory environments. We propose a formal model of a pharmaceutical firm’s investment in clinical trials. Our model can explain why voluntary trial registries could {{not solve the problem}} of selective reporting of trial results. We show that compulsory trial registers reduce the incentives to invest in trials. Our model predicts that, instead of registries, the implementation of a system of voluntary results databases can be a much more successful regulatory tool: (i) it can avoid the problem of selective reporting of clinical trial outcomes and (ii) it increases the incentives of the firms to invest in clinical trials. Finally, our results highlight the importance <b>of</b> the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> market competition on the incentives to perform clinical trials and, thus, on the success of the regulations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the determinants of}} the levels and rates of technology adoption for petroleum refineries that survived the period 1980 - 1989, during which the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> demand and crude oil supply changed significantly.

Both levels and rates of adoption are hypothesized {{to be affected by}} refinery size, regulatory status, elements of local markets, and geographical factors. Empirical results generally suggest that compared with the supply-side factors of crude oil sources and regulatory subsidies, refinery size and demand-side factors, such as total consumption, consumption growth and fluctuation, and changes of the consumption mix, are responsible for the most part of the determination of technology adoption for refineries surviving the 1980 s.
