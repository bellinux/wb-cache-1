50|$|Although a {{long-term}} cooling trend was well underway, {{there is evidence}} of a warm period during the Miocene when the global climate rivalled that of the Oligocene. The Miocene warming began 21 million years ago and continued until 14 million years ago, when global temperatures took a sharp drop—the Middle Miocene <b>Climate</b> <b>Transition</b> (MMCT). By 8 million years ago, temperatures dropped sharply once again, and the Antarctic ice sheet was already approaching its present-day size and thickness. Greenland may have begun to have large glaciers as early as 7 to 8 million years ago, although the climate for the most part remained warm enough to support forests there well into the Pliocene.|$|E

50|$|Two {{proteins}} {{have been}} found {{to play a major role}} in toothed whale echolocation. Prestin, a motor protein of the outer hair cells of the inner ear of the mammalian cochlea, has an association between the number of nonsynonymous substitutions and hearing sensitivity. It has undergone two clear episodes of accelerated protein evolution in cetaceans: on the ancestral branch of odontocetes and on the branch leading to delphinioidae. The first episode of acceleration is connected to odontocete divergence, when echolocation first developed, and the second occurs with the increase in echolocation frequency seen in the delphinioidae family. Cldn14, a member of the tight junction proteins which form barriers between inner ear cells, shows exactly the same evolutionary pattern as Prestin. The two events of protein evolution, for Prestin and Cldn14, occurred at the same times as the tectonic opening of the Drake Passage (34-31 Ma) and the Antarctic ice growth at the middle Miocene <b>climate</b> <b>transition</b> (14 Ma), with the divergence of odontocetes and mysticetes occurring with the former, and the speciation of delphinioidae with the latter. There is a strong connection between these proteins, the ocean restructuring events, and the echolocation evolution.|$|E

5000|$|As a first step, GDRs codifies {{the right}} to {{development}} as a development threshold − a level of welfare below which people {{are not expected to}} share the costs of the <b>climate</b> <b>transition.</b> It’s important to note that this threshold is not an extreme poverty line, which is typically defined to be so low ($1 or $2 a day) as to be more properly called a “destitution line.” Rather, it is set to be above the global poverty line (about $16 per person per day, in Purchasing Power Parity terms [...] ), and to reflect a level of welfare that is beyond basic needs, but still well short of today’s levels of affluent consumption.The level where a development threshold would best be set is a matter for debate. In the GDRs standard case, it is set to be modestly (25%) above the global poverty line, at about $20 per person per day ($7,500 per year). This figure reflects an empirical analysis of the income levels at which the classic plagues of poverty - malnutrition, high infant mortality, low educational attainment, high relative food expenditures - begin to disappear, or at least become exceptions to the rule. It also reflects the level at which the southern “middle class” begins to emerge.|$|E

In winter snow thickness episodes live media, so despite not having much altitude valley was cold and the accumulated snow level down in this area compared to other towns like La Laguna.And finally, we need to highlight the last most significant aspect of the village. As mentioned previously, Carme {{is located in the}} middle of a valley, which affords a variety biological and mineral. In fact Carme and surrounding stand for a special occasion; the fact is that due to the geographical position of the valley, we find in these different climates and vegetation.

This confluence cause the formation of a small microclimate in the valley of Carme, which creates a very special phenomenon in the valley. In the midst of this special climate, individuals are more comfortable there are some birds that are in this space weather and vegetation ideal for playback. A year ago, a team of specialists and animal rights carried out a field study in the field in order to locate and highlight what were actually groups of birds we could find. The result of this study showed that in the Valley of Carme they could get to find more than 50 different bird species and up to 85. These could highlight the Executioner, the Shrike, Cornell black or swallow.|$|E
40|$|Fifty-eight {{species of}} elongate, {{cylindrical}} benthic foraminifera (here {{referred to as}} the Extinction Group) belonging to genera that became extinct during the mid-Pleistocene <b>Climate</b> <b>Transition</b> (MPT), were documented (~ 50 kyr resolution) through the early middle Miocene (15 - 13 Ma) in two sites {{on opposite sides of the}} subtropical Pacific Ocean (ODP Sites 1146, South China Sea; ODP Site 1237, southeast Pacific). The study was undertaken to investigate the response of the Extinction Group (Ext.

Gp faunal differences between the two sites (attributed to regional and bathymetric differences in food supply to the seafloor) are greater than those that occurred through the 2 myr time span at either site. The middle Miocene <b>Climate</b> <b>Transition</b> was not an interval of enhanced species turnover or a decline in Ext.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between summer-autumn floods in Central Europe and climate warming is poorly constrained by available instrumental, historical, proxy and model data. To investigate this relationship, a complete record of paleofloods, regional glacier length changes (and associated climate phases) and regional glacier advances and retreats (and associated <b>climate</b> <b>transitions)</b> {{are derived from}} the varved sediments of Lake Silvaplana (ca. 1450 BC–AD 420; Upper Engadine, Switzerland). In combination, these records {{provide insight into the}} behavior of floods (i. e. frequency) under a wide range of climate conditions. Eighty-five paleofloods are identified from turbidites in the sediments of Lake Silvaplana. Regional glacier length changes (and associated cool and/or wet and warm and/or dry climate phases) are inferred from centennial 1 / 2 anomalies in the square root of low-pass (LP) filtered Mass Accumulation Rates (MARLP). Regional glacier advances and retreats (and associated cooling and/or wetting and warming and/or drying <b>climate</b> <b>transitions)</b> are inferred from centennial trends in MARLP. This is the first continuous record of glacier length changes in the Lake Silvaplana catchment for this time period. These data agree with regional records of land-use, glacier activity and lake levels. More frequent turbidites are found during cool and/or wet phases of ca. 1450 BC to AD 420. However, no relationship to <b>climate</b> <b>transitions</b> is discerned. Consistently, June–July–August (JJA) temperatures dating ca. 570 BC–AD 120 are inversely correlated to the frequency of turbidites. The rate that turbidite frequency increases with cooler JJA temperatures is not linear. Finally, 130 analogues for a 21 st century climate in the Alps between ca. 570 BC–AD 120 (i. e. 50 year windows with a warming trend and average JJA temperature exceeding AD 1950 –AD 2000 values from nearby meteo station Sils Maria) are considered. These reveal that turbidites are less frequent than between ca. 1450 BC–AD 420...|$|R
40|$|The sensitivities of benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca and Li/Ca {{to bottom}} water {{temperature}} and carbonate saturation state {{have recently been}} assessed. Here we present a new approach that uses paired Mg/Ca and Li/Ca records to calculate simultaneous changes in temperature and saturation state. Using previously published records, we first use this approach to document a cooling of deep ocean waters associated {{with the establishment of}} the Antarctic ice sheet at the Eocene-Oligocene <b>climate</b> <b>transition.</b> We then apply this approach to new records of the Middle Miocene <b>Climate</b> <b>Transition</b> from ODP Site 761 to estimate variations in bottom water temperature and the oxygen isotopic composition of seawater. We estimate that the oxygen isotopic composition of seawater varied by ~ 1 per mil between the deglacial extreme of the Miocene Climatic Optimum and the glacial maximum following the Middle Miocene <b>Climate</b> <b>Transition,</b> indicating large amplitude variations in ice volume. However, the longer-term change between 15. 3 and 12. 5 Ma is marked by a ~ 1 °C cooling of deep waters, and an increase in the oxygen isotopic composition of seawater of ~ 0. 6 per mil. We find that bottom water saturation state increased in the lead up to the Middle Miocene <b>Climate</b> <b>Transition</b> and decreased shortly after.

40|$|International audienceThe {{origin and}} {{bifurcation}} structure of abrupt millennial-scale <b>climate</b> <b>transitions</b> under steady external solar forcing {{and in the}} absence of atmospheric synoptic variability is studied by means of a global coupled model of intermediate complexity. We show that the origin of Dansgaard-Oeschger type oscillations in the model is caused by the weaker northward oceanic heat transport in the Atlantic basin. This is in agreement with previous studies realized with much simpler models, based on highly idealized geometries and simplified physics. The existence of abrupt millennial-scale <b>climate</b> <b>transitions</b> during glacial times can therefore be interpreted as a consequence of the weakening of the negative temperature-advection feedback. This is confirmed through a series of numerical experiments designed to explore the sensitivity of the bifurcation structure of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation to increased atmospheric CO 2 levels under glacial boundary conditions. Contrasting with the cold, stadial, phases of millennial oscillations, we also show the emergence of strong interdecadal variability in the North Atlantic sector during warm interstadials. The instability driving these interdecadal-interstadial oscillations is shown to be identical to that found in ocean-only models forced by fixed surface buoyancy fluxes, that is, a large-scale baroclinic instability developing in the vicinity of the western boundary current in the North Atlantic. Comparisons with modern observations further suggest a physical mechanism similar to that driving the 30 - 40 years time scale associated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation...|$|R
