40|$|ABSTRACT The two-microelectrode {{technique}} of voltage clamping sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers {{was used to}} examine the changes in contraction which occur during trains of voltage clamps. (A "train " is defined as a series of voltage clamps delivered at a particular rate, beginning after a rest long enough that the effects of previous stimulation have died away.) Contractions showed striking staircases, or progressive changes in peak isometric tension, during trains. Short clamps, clamps to voltages more negative than [...] 20 or [...] 30 mV, or holding potentials less negative than the resting potential favored negative staircases, while long clamps, clamps to positive voltages, and holding potentials near the resting potential each favored positive staircases. The staircase behavior appeared to be due to changes in the initial rate of recovery of the ability to contract. The changes in staircase behavior as a function of <b>clamp</b> <b>voltage</b> suggested that the relationship between peak tension and <b>clamp</b> <b>voltage</b> should depend on the experimental design. When the steady-state contraction was plotted as a function of <b>clamp</b> <b>voltage,</b> voltage-tension relations like those recently reported for working ventricle were obtained, with a threshold between [...] 30 and [...] 40 mV and a steep relation between tension and voltage.

Only one exponential current relaxation (apart from the capacitive spike) could be resolved up to a <b>clamp</b> <b>voltage</b> of ∼ 120 mV within the time resolution of our experimental instrumentation (100 μs). This means that the rate constants of the heterogeneous complexation, kR (association) and kD (dissociation), were too fast to be resolved. Therefore, the “Läuger” model for carrier-mediated ion transport with equilibrium heterogeneous surface reaction was used to fit the experimental results. The voltage dependence of the initial membrane conductance {{was used for the}} evaluation of the voltage dependence of the translocation rate constant of the complexed carriers, kAS. The initial conductance was found to be independent on the <b>clamp</b> <b>voltage,</b> which means that the translocation rate constant kAS is a linear function of the applied voltage and that the voltage dependence of the translocation of charged carriers through the plasmalemma could be explained by a square-type Nernst-Planck barrier. The movement of the complexed form of the carrier through the membrane may be explained by a diffusion process rather than by simple first-order kinetic jump across an Eyring-type potential well. The current relaxation after a voltage clamp was studied {{as a function of the}} external chloride concentration.

40|$|Considering {{the limited}} {{availability}} of fossile energy resources {{the fuel cell}} (FC) concept is of increasing importance. In this work the suitability of ammonium for usage in a PEMFC has been studied. A commercialy available PEMFC (H-Tec) has been utilized in conjunction with hydrogen {{on one hand and}} compared to the utilization of ammonium on the other hand. Hydrogen yielded a stable <b>clamp</b> <b>voltage</b> of 0. 9 volts, whereas the <b>clamp</b> <b>voltage</b> broke down to 0. 05 volts within 20 minutes in the ammonium case. Further experiments have shown the damage of the FC by ammonium. The reusage of hydrogen lead to overall cell voltage of only 0. 4 to 0. 5 volts. Another option for utilizing ammonium as a carrier of energy is electrochemical decomposition which has also been investigated. cyclovoltammograms of ammonium in aprotic solvents with platinum, palladium, gold, graphit, steel, zink, titanium, and copper electrodes have been measured. Compared to other materials platinum, palladium, and gold are advantegous due to their low ammonium oxidation potential of approximately 1. 0 volt. Further investigations with rotating disk electrodes produced no reliable results due to fast ammonium depletion by the electrode thus limiting current measurements. It is well known that the electrochemical oxidation is effected by nitrogen adsorption at the electrodes. Some mediators such as Mn(II) /Mn(III), Cu(I) /Cu(II) or 2, 2, 6, 6 -Tetrametyl-piperidinyl- 1 -oxyl-Radikal (TEMPO) have been studied by CV for their ability to prevent this effect. Only for TEMPO a positive effect on the ammonium oxidation could be observed. According to the measurements a mechanism has been postulated. The performance of electrolyses may be expressed in terms of the energy balance meaning the difference of energy retrievable from the hydrogen fuel cell and that consumed by the ammonium oxidation.

40|$|AbstractVoltage-clamp {{experiments}} {{were performed on}} lipid bilayer membranes to study the voltage dependence of the iodine-mediated halide transport. Under all experimental conditions only one exponential current relaxation, apart from the capacitive spike, could be resolved up to a <b>clamp</b> <b>voltage</b> of 200 mV. The current relaxation could be described by an initial conductance, G 0, the relaxation time constant, τ, and the relaxation amplitude, α, that {{is the difference between}} the initial current, I 0, and the steady state current, I 00, divided by the steady state current. The occurrence of one single exponential relaxation suggested that one of the different transport steps involved in the carrier-mediated ion transport according to the Läuger-model is always in equilibrium. This is most probably the transport of the free carriers across the membrane. The voltage dependence of G 0, τ, and of α were used to determine the voltage dependence of the translocation rate constants of the complexed carriers, kAS. In the case of the iodine-mediated iodide transport, G 0, τ and α were only mediate voltage-dependent, which means the voltage dependent translocation of the complex encounters a trapezoidal barrier shape. For the iodine-mediated bromide translocation G 0, τ and α exhibited no dependence on the applied clamp-voltage, which suggested that a square Nernst-Planck barrier limits the transport of the corresponding complex...|$|E

The model was tested experimentally using human and rabbit Na+-glucose cotransporters (SGLT 1), and was used to explain controversies regarding unstirred layer effects. Cotransport of Na+, sugar and water was monitored by two-electrode voltage clamp and online measurements of oocyte volume. The specific resistance of the oocyte cytoplasm was found by means of microelectrodes to be 263 ± 91 Ω cm (s. d., n = 52), or 2. 5 times that of Kulori medium, in agreement with reported values of intracellular ion concentrations and diffusion constants. Osmotically induced volume and resistance changes were compatible with a model of the oocyte in which 37 ± 17 % (s. d., n = 66) of the intracellular volume acts as a free solution while the remainder is inert, being occupied by organelles, etc. The model explains the results of several types of experiments: rapid changes in rates of water cotransport induced by changes in <b>clamp</b> <b>voltage</b> followed by osmotic equilibration in sugar-free conditions; volume changes induced by Na+ transport via the ionophore gramicidin; and uphill water transport.
