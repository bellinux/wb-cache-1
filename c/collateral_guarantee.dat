The Affair is briefly thus; like all [...] other young men just let loose, and especially one as I am, freed from [...] the worse than bondage of my maternal home, I have been extravagant, [...] and consequently am in want of Money. You will probably now imagine [...] that I am going to apply to you for some.

All I expect [...] or wish is, that you will be joint Security with me for a few Hundreds [...] a person (one of the money lending tribe) has offered to advance in [...] case I can bring forward any <b>collateral</b> <b>guarantee</b> that he will not be [...] a loser, the reason of this requisition is my being a Minor, and might [...] refuse to discharge a debt contracted in my non-age.

Our database covers the period 2006 – 2009 for a total of 560 339 firms and 214 banks. Our analysis shows that <b>collateral</b> <b>guarantee</b> affects the cost of credit for Italian firms by systematically reducing the interest rate of secured loans. This effect was larger during the crisis. Personal guarantees show no systematic effect on interest rates, but favour firms’ access to credit. Furthermore, guarantees are a more powerful instrument for riskier borrowers than for safer borrowers, i. e., the decrease in interest rates due to the presence of guarantees is larger for the former than for the latter...|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to answer why and how the different ownership control types impact the firms 2 ̆ 7 preference and accessibility to either long- or short-term debts. Design/methodology/approach - The univariate analysis was used to test the differences of debt maturity choices for firms grouped by ownership control types, profitability and institutional development. Then, logit regression and ordinary least squares regression were applied to examine the determinants of ownership control types in debt maturity structures. Findings - Compared to privately controlled firms, state-owned enterprises had greater access to long-term debt and used less short-term debt during the sample period. Evidences also indicate that the on-going financial reform has increased the motivation of banks to consider company profitability in their lending decisions. However, state-owned banks still discriminate private firms in allocation of financial resources, particular in less-developed regions. Research limitations/implications - Due to the research scope and data limitations, the authors cannot take some factors into consideration, such as <b>collateral,</b> <b>guarantee,</b> credit ranking, financing agreement and leasing obligation. Originality/value - This study extends the existing literature in three ways. First, the authors investigate the bank discrimination problem into the loan term structure.

THE LEGAL ACTION THE BANK CARRIES OUT WHEN THE INSURED VIOLATES THE GUARANTEE BANK AGREEMENT (A STUDY IN THE SURAKARTA MAIN BRANCH OF PT BANK NEGARA INDONESIA). Faculty of Law of Sebelas Maret University. This {{research}} aims to {{find out}} the procedure of giving bank the guarantee carried out by the Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia as well as the legal action carried out by the Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia when the insured violates the guarantee bank agreement. This writing belongs to an empirical law research that is descriptive in nature. The data type employed was primary and secondary data. The secondary data source included primary, secondary and tertiary data. Techniques of collecting data used were interview and library study. Technique of analyzing data used was an interactive model of analysis, in which the data collected would be then analyzed using 3 (three) stages: data reduction, data display and conclusion drawing. Considering the result of research and discussion, it can be concluded that firstly, the Procedure of giving bank guarantee in the Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia can be divided into 2 (two) types: bank guarantee giving with full cover collateral and bank guarantee giving with non-full cover <b>collateral.</b> <b>Guarantee</b> bank with full cover collateral means that the collateral {{is in the form of}} account. Meanwhile the guarantee bank with non-full cover guarantee means it is guaranteed with the customer’s account and asset as included in the Guarantee Bank Publication Agreement (PPGB). The guarantee bank publication by the Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia governed in the Guidelines and Policy of Retail Market Credit has been consistent with the conditions of guarantee bank publication included in the Decree of Indonesian Bank Director Board Number 11 / 110 /Kep. /Dir/UPBB about the Collateral Giving by Bank and Collateral Giving by the Non-Bank financial institution as well as Bank of Indonesia’s Circular Number: SE 11 / 11 concerning the Collateral Giving by Bank and Collateral Giving by Non-Bank Financial Institution.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{possibility}} of the simultaneous presence of three key features in price-taking credit markets: infinity horizon, collateralized credit operations and effective additional enforcement mechanisms, i. e. those implying payments besides the value of the <b>collateral</b> <b>guarantees.</b> We show that these additional mechanisms, instead of strengthening, actually weaken the restrictions that collateral places on borrowing. In fact, when collateral requirements are not large enough in relation to the effectiveness of the additional mechanisms, lenders anticipate total payments exceeding the value of the collateral requirements. Thus, by non-arbitrage, they lend more than the value of these guarantees. In turn, in the absence of other market frictions such as borrowing constraints, agents may indefinitely postpone their debts, implying the collapse of the agent's maximization problem and of such credit markets. ...|$|R

30|$|Second, {{access to}} {{external}} funding sources is hindered by the lower availability of explicit <b>guarantees</b> (<b>collateral)</b> and implicit <b>guarantees</b> (cash flow {{expected from the}} project) for small innovative firms compared to traditional firms. Regarding the explicit guarantees, small innovative firms are characterized by {{a high incidence of}} intangible and firm-specific assets, which increase the risk for the potential financier (Hall 2002; Gompers 1995). The immateriality of capital does not allow the firm to provide innovative inside collateral which is able to reduce the cost of failure, while specificity in the use of intangible assets makes the decision to invest irreversibly. Regarding implied warranties, at least in the early stages, small innovative firms are not able to generate positive cash flows required for debt service (pledgeable income). This prevents lenders from possibly having guarantees in the short term about the return of debt using operating cash flow.|$|R

40|$|European-wide data {{concerning}} {{both companies}} and households {{indicate that the}} credit rationing phenomenon, which has been predicted by theory, does in fact occur to a significant degree in the European credit market. Among SMEs, micro companies are most vulnerable and the current economic crisis has only made these concerns more pressing. Top-down use of the monetary transmission mechanism alone is insufficient to counter the problem. The other solution consists of a bottom-up, microeconomic stimulation of lending transactions, by focusing on <b>collateral</b> and <b>guarantees.</b> The data confirm the high importance that lenders – especially individual households and micro companies – attach to <b>collateral</b> and <b>guarantees</b> when making their lending decisions. As a consequence, we would argue that {{those parts of the}} law governing security interests and guarantees should be one of the primary targets for government policy aimed at improving credit flows, especially in avoiding a conflict between consumer protection measures and laws on surety and guarantees.
