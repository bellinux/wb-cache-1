5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1856 by Arthur Wallis and Charles Haslam in newly built {{premises}} which they named The North Hants Ironworks. The works were sited on Station Hill in Basingstoke and the company began trading as Wallis & Haslam. Shortly afterwards the company was highly commended for its hand-worked bench drilling machine at the 1857 Royal Agricultural show in Salisbury. Even at this early stage, the company was producing {{a wide variety of}} agricultural equipment, and alongside the bench <b>drill</b> were <b>corn</b> <b>drills,</b> turnip drills, four types of horse hoe, drag harrows, a 3 hp threshing machine, a barley hummeller and sundry other devices. In 1862 a third partner, Charles James Steevens, joined the company and when Charles Haslam retired in 1869 the company became Wallis & Steevens.The date of production for the company's first Portable steam engine is not known although the earliest surviving drawing is dated 1866. The first traction engine, an 8 hp single, was built in 1877 from drawings by Arthur Herbert Wallis (son of the company founder) and this vehicle made its trial run on 21 June that year. The vehicle, named [...] "Success" [...] on the strength of its performance during the test, was given the works number T250.|$|R

40|$|In 2000, beekeepers {{from the}} Italian region of Friuli {{reported}} losses {{of a high}} number of bee hives during the spring season. At the time of this bee incident farmers in Friuli had started to <b>drill</b> their <b>corn</b> fields and some of the seeds had been treated with the seed dressing product Gaucho (active ingredient: imidacloprid). Reports by some French beekeepers on suspected impacts of seed dressed sunflowers on honeybees made some Italian beekeepers to believe {{that there might be a}} link between their bee losses and the use of Gaucho seed dressing on <b>corn</b> seed. During <b>drilling,</b> dust particles are emitted by the pneumatic seed drilling ma-chines which may also contain abraded seed dressing particles. In response to this concern, further investigations were conducted to examine whether corn crops, seed-treated with Gaucho will pose a risk to honey bees. In October 2001 and June 2002, two field trials were conducted in Germany with Italian and German commercial maize seeds to investigate the possible abrasion of Gaucho from seed-treated maize during sowing with a pneumatic drilling machine. The results show an average emission rate of only 4 % on the seed drilling rate with a standard dressing formulation. Formulations with adjuvants diminished abrasions even more. In parallel, a replicated cage test with honey bees was conducted to examine whether the recorded abrasion rates could ad-versely affect honeybee colonies foraging on flowering plants with simulated deposits of emitted dust particles. From the findings of this replicated cage study it can be concluded that deposition rates which were much higher than those potentially emitted fro...|$|R

40|$|R. Douglas Hurt {{deals with}} the {{invention}} and development of American farm implements and machinery with a special emphasis on the nineteenth century. The material is organized around the functions of various agricultural machines used in the major grain-growing states. Ten chapters focus on the improvements made in plows, grain <b>drills,</b> <b>corn</b> planters, cultivators, reapers, binders, headers, corn binders, corn shellers, threshing machines, combined harvesters, mowing machines, hay stackers, feed mills, and steam traction engines. The author decided to describe certain lines of farm equipment without trying to catalogue all agricultural tools, implements, and machines. Therefore the reader will not find descriptions of such items as cotton gins, saw mills, blacksmith tools, windmills, irrigation pumps, wagons, buggies, washing machines, and hardware materials. Also, during the period 1892 to 1914, no mention is made of the manufacture of {{the internal combustion engine}} and its uses in stationary gas engines, the early tractors, automobiles, trucks, and electric light plants. The judicious use of 219 photographs and illustrations gives a visual presentation of the evolution of rural technology. The verbal descriptions of mechanical and technical matters can be readily understood by the general reader. The book includes a good bibliography and a helpful appendix to aid the reader in understanding the importance of metallurgy as an important factor in the manufacture of farm machinery. Better farm machinery had to wait until the making of steel had been perfected. Some readers would welcome more analysis and interpretation of rural technology. For example, virtually all historians mention that our colonial forefathers used the wooden plow, the sickle, and the flail to grow crops, the same tools used thousands of years earlier in Biblical times. Why was this progress so slow? Why were no new machines invented in colonial America in the 170 years prior to the Revolutionary War? Why did it take two hundred years of experimentation before the first successful track-type Caterpillar engines were built in 1904 ? Combines were widely used in the Pacific Coast states in the 1880 s, yet they were not adopted in the Midwest until the late 1920 s, a lag of forty years. Perhaps historians should give more attention to the factors that deter progress and to the obstacles that prevent the adoption of new ideas, to try to explain the inability of people to adopt new methods. Nevertheless, the narrative is informative and well written. American Farm Tools is a fine addition to the historical record...|$|R
