Sodium orthovanadate, an inhibitor of phosphotyrosine phosphatases that nonspecifically elevates the level of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in cells, stimulated transcription from the viral promoter. The effects of both pp 60 v-src and orthovanadate were resistant to cycloheximide.

40|$|Microbial {{communities}} are increasingly utilised in biotechnology. Efficiency and productivity {{in many of}} these applications depends on the presence of cooperative interactions between members of the community. Two key processes underlying these interactions are the production of public goods and metabolic <b>crossfeeding,</b> which can be understood in the general framework of ecological and evolutionary (eco-evo) dynamics. In this review we illustrate the relevance of cooperative interactions in microbial biotechnological processes, discuss their mechanistic origins, and analyse their evolutionary resilience. Cooperative behaviours can be damaged by the emergence of ‘cheating’ cells that benefit from the cooperative interactions but do not contribute to them. Despite this, cooperative interactions can be stabilized by spatial segregation, by the presence of feedbacks between the evolutionary dynamics and the ecology of the community, by the role of regulatory systems coupled to the environmental conditions and by the action of horizontal gene transfer. Cooperative interactions enrich microbial communities with a higher degree of robustness against environmental stress and can facilitate the evolution of more complex traits. Therefore, the evolutionary resilience of microbial communities and their ability to constraint detrimental mutants should be considered in order to design robust biotechnological applications...|$|R
40|$|Cross-feeding is the {{exchange}} of nutrients among species of microbes. It has two potential evolutionary origins, one as an exchange of metabolic wastes or byproducts among species, the other {{as a form of}} cooperation known as reciprocal altruism. This paper explores the conditions favoring the origin of cooperative cross-feeding between two species. There is an extensive literature on the evolution of cooperation, and some of the requirements for the evolution of cooperative cross-feeding follow from this prior work–specifically the requirement that interactions be limited to small groups of individuals, such as colonies in a spatially structured environment. Evolution of cooperative cross-feeding by a species also requires that cross-feeding from the partner species already exists, so that the cooperating mutant will automatically be reciprocated for its actions. Beyond these considerations, some unintuitive dynamical constraints apply. In particular, the benefit of cooperative cross-feeding applies only in the range of intermediate cell densities. At low density, resource concentrations are too low to offset the cost of cooperation. At high density, resources shared by both species become limiting, and the two species become competitors. These considerations suggest that the evolution of cooperative <b>crossfeeding</b> in nature may be more challenging than for other types of cooperation.

50|$|Crossfeeding blends {{the left}} and right stereo {{channels}} slightly, reducing the extreme channel separation which is characteristic of headphone listening in older stereo recordings, and is known to cause headaches in a small fraction of listeners. <b>Crossfeed</b> also improves the soundstage characteristics and makes the music sound more natural, as if one was listening to a pair of speakers. While some swear by <b>crossfeed,</b> many prefer amplifiers without it. The introduction of digital signal processing (DSP) technology led a number of manufacturers to introduce amplifiers with 'headphone virtualization' features. In principle, the DSP chips allow the two-driver headphone to simulate a full Dolby 5.1 (or more) surround system. When the sounds from the two headphone drivers mix, they create the phase difference the brain uses to locate the source of a sound. Through most headphones, because the right and left channels do not combine as they do with <b>crossfeed,</b> the illusion of sound directionality is created.|$|E

NRK cell division was stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF), and these cells showed high levels of EGF receptors, as determined by 125 I-labeled EGF binding. KNRK cells were unresponsive to EGF and no EGF receptors were detectable. Ts cells also were unresponsive to EGF at both temperatures, but exhibited just detectable EGF binding at 32 degrees C and 10 - 15 % of NRK cell binding at 39 degrees C. Use of EGF added to the culture medium by these cells paralleled the receptor levels. <b>Crossfeeding</b> experiments among NRK, KNRK, and Ts cultures indicated that Ts cells at the permissive temperature and KNRK cells at both temperatures produced a heat-stable substance(s) which stimulated DNA synthesis in NRK cells independent {{of the presence of}} serum or of EGF.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The microaerophilic {{bacterium}} Azorhizobium caulinodans, when fixing N(2) both in pure cultures held at 20 µM dissolved O(2) {{tension and}} as endosymbiont of Sesbania rostrata legume nodules, employs a novel, respiratory-membrane endo-hydrogenase to oxidize and recycle endogenous H(2) produced by soluble Mo-dinitrogenase {{activity at the}} expense of O(2). METHODS AND FINDINGS: From a bioinformatic analysis, this endo-hydrogenase is a core (6 subunit) version of (14 subunit) NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (respiratory complex I). In pure A. caulinodans liquid cultures, when O(2) levels are lowered to < 1 µM dissolved O(2) tension (true microaerobic physiology), in vivo endo-hydrogenase activity reverses and continuously evolves H(2) at high rates. In essence, H(+) ions then supplement scarce O(2) as respiratory-membrane electron acceptor. Paradoxically, from thermodynamic considerations, such hydrogenic respiratory-membrane electron transfer need largely uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, required for growth of non-phototrophic aerobic bacteria, A. caulinodans included. CONCLUSIONS: A. caulinodans in vivo endo-hydrogenase catalytic activity is bidirectional. To our knowledge, this study is the first demonstration of hydrogenic respiratory-membrane electron transfer among aerobic (non-fermentative) bacteria. When compared with O(2) tolerant hydrogenases in other organisms, A. caulinodans in vivo endo-hydrogenase mediated H(2) production rates (50, 000 pmol 10 (9) ·cells(- 1) min(- 1)) are at least one-thousandfold higher. Conceivably, A. caulinodans respiratory-membrane hydrogenesis might initiate H(2) <b>crossfeeding</b> among spatially organized bacterial populations whose individual cells adopt distinct metabolic states in response to variant O(2) availability.

40|$|Abstract Background Resource cycling is a {{defining}} {{process in the}} maintenance of the biosphere. Microbial communities, ranging from simple to highly diverse, {{play a crucial role in}} this process. Yet the evolutionary adaptation and speciation of micro-organisms have rarely been studied in the context of resource cycling. In this study, our basic questions are how does a community evolve its resource usage and how are resource cycles partitioned? Results We design a computational model in which a population of individuals evolves to take up nutrients and excrete waste. The waste of one individual is another's resource. Given a fixed amount of resources, this leads to resource cycles. We find that the shortest cycle dominates the ecological dynamics, and over evolutionary time its length is minimized. Initially a single lineage processes a long cycle of resources, later <b>crossfeeding</b> lineages arise. The evolutionary dynamics that follow are determined by the strength of indirect selection for resource cycling. We study indirect selection by changing the spatial setting and the strength of direct selection. If individuals are fixed at lattice sites or direct selection is low, indirect selection result in lineages that structure their local environment, leading to 'smart' individuals and stable patterns of resource dynamics. The individuals are good at cycling resources themselves and do this with a short cycle. On the other hand, if individuals randomly change position each time step, or direct selection is high, individuals are more prone to crossfeeding: an ecosystem based solution with turbulent resource dynamics, and individuals that are less capable of cycling resources themselves. Conclusion In a baseline model of ecosystem evolution we demonstrate different eco-evolutionary trajectories of resource cycling. By varying the strength of indirect selection through the spatial setting and direct selection, the integration of information by the evolutionary process leads to qualitatively different results from individual smartness to cooperative community structures. </p...|$|R

Those modes are sensitive to CKM parameters and allow to test Standard Model predictions related to CP violation. Some of them, such as B^ 0 _s→ K^-π^+π^ 0 and B^ 0 _s→ K^+K^-π^ 0, have not been observed previously. This is the first analysis with energetic π^ 0 in LHCb. To evaluate the detector performance for π^ 0, D^*+→ D^ 0 (→ K^-π^+π^ 0) π^+ decays have been selected. This provides a clean and high statistics sample of neutral pions used to study their energy calibration {{as well as the}} effectiveness of the π^ 0 /γ separation tool of the experiment. Radiative decays are indeed the most dangerous backgrounds for the study of B^ 0 _d,s→ h^+h'^-π^ 0 modes. To select B^ 0 _d,s→ h^+h'^-π^ 0 events, a dedicated trigger algorithm has been implemented. It complements the standard online selections and significantly improves the efficiency. Offline, obvious backgrounds, mainly from charm decays, are rejected applying simple criteria. The sample is then further purified using a multivariate classifier.

However, molecular mechanisms that underpin adaptation to anaerobic environments are not well understood. This study aims {{to understand how the}} facultative anaerobe, Escherichia coli, adapts to environments that vary in oxygen content. An experimental evolution experiment was conducted in which replicate lineages were established from a preevolved clonal culture of E. coli REL 4536. Lineages were serially sub-cultured for 4, 000 generations within strict aerobic and strict anaerobic environments, and a treatment that fluctuated between the two environments. Significant increases in the relative fitness of lineages exposed to anaerobic conditions were observed, whereas the relative fitness of lineages in aerobic conditions did not increase, likely as the ancestor had been pre-adapted to aerobic growth. Mutations that arose during evolution were identified by genome sequencing randomly-selected clones from each lineage at 2, 000 and 4, 000 generations. Traits that contributed to adaptation were predicted via the occurrence of independent mutations affecting common traits among lineages. Adaptation to the anaerobic environment was facilitated by modifications to anaerobic fermentation and the inactivation of virulence genes, whereas in the aerobic environment, mutations predicted to confer a growth advantage in stationary phase were observed. The evolution of generalists involved traits that were similar to those found in both aerobic and anaerobically evolved lineages, as well as the deletion of cryptic prophages from the genome and modifications to amino acid transport. Phenotypically distinct small colony morphotypes (SCM) arose within anaerobic lineages and two separate adaptive pathways are hypothesised for this divergence. SCM 1 were capable of stable coexistence with co-evolved cells of typical colony morphotype, most likely through an acetate <b>crossfeeding</b> mechanism. In contrast, SCM 2 was able to out-compete the ancestor within 14 days, despite exhibiting a lower growth rate than the ancestor. SCM 2 likely evolved the ability to inhibit the ancestral strain through a contact dependent inhibition mechanism, as evidenced by a mutation in glgC.

The work discussed here is a first report of the isolation of genetically marked strains of J. caries and their use in wheat plant infection studies. Procedures for the isolation of auxotrophic and drug-resistant mutants in haploid strains of J. caries were developed. Preliminary determination of the nuclear condition of secondary sporidia showed that spores were typically mononucleate. Additionally, characterization of the kinetics of secondary sporidial formation in liquid culture provided essential information concerning the extent of the logrithmic phase of growth and spore generation rates. Log-phase sporidia of two monokaryotic, compatible strains of race T-l were mutagenized with nitrosoguanidine. Two "non-leaky" nutritional mutants were isolated and characterized; one required adenine, the other uracil. Five "leaky" nutritional mutants were also isolated. One was identified as a glycine auxotroph, and the other four had mutations in pathways for general nitrogen metabolism. Additionally, secondary sporidia of T. caries were tested for their growth response to twelve different drugs in attempts to isolate drug-resistant strains. Only mutants resistant to cycloheximide were detected. Pairings of compatible auxotrophic strains produced mycelial growth on a minimal medium whereas unpaired strains typically failed to grow. Growth in the absence of nutritional supplements was presumed to be due either to 'forced' heterokaryon formation or syntrophism (i. e., <b>crossfeeding).</b> Inability to successfully isolate viable hyphal tips from colonies arising from paired auxotrophic strains precluded proof of heterokaryosis. Hypodermic inoculations with compatible auxotrophic, drug-resistant, and wild type strains failed to result in teliospore production in wheat plants of the susceptible spring wheat var. 'Red Bobs'. J. caries was successfully reisolated as four morphologically distinct colony or sector types from 38 plants that failed to head normally. It was also isolated from a small number of mature plants showing no signs of disease. All auxotrophic and drug-resistant strains were successfully recovered as individual haploid isolates from outgrown colonies on wheat plant tissue. Inability to success fully isolate viable hyphal tips precluded proof of heterokaryosis. Consequently, the nuclear condition, i. e., heterokaryon or homokaryon, of the outgrown fungus was not determined...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 A {{major factor}} in the ability of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf- 5 to act as a {{biological}} control agent is its production of antibiotics, including pyoluteorin (PLT), 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol (2, 4 -DAPG) and pyrrolnitrin (PRN). The data provided in this thesis demonstrate that the presence of any of these antibiotics in the extracellular milieu affects production of that same antibiotic, as well as others, by Pf- 5. Amending the growth medium with antibiotics had multiple effects on secondary metabolism in Pf- 5. i) PLT positively regulated its own production, ii) 2, 4 -DAPG positively regulated its own production. iii) PLT suppressed 2, 4 -DAPG production. iv) 2, 4 - DAPG inhibited PLT production. v) PLT suppressed transcription of a heterologous ferric-pyoverdine uptake gene. vi) PRN exerted a slight inhibitory effect on PLT gene transcription and production. PLT autoinduction by Pf- 5 was extensively characterized, and was shown to require concentrations of exogenous PLT in the nanomolar range. These low concentrations are comparable to those of many molecules proposed to function in signaling roles. PLT served as a signal between distinct populations of cells within the rhizosphere, where it prompted autoinduction by those cells. Aside from effects of Pf- 5 antibiotics on one another, I also described the positive effect of exogenous PLT on expression of a set of transport genes flanking the PLT biosynthetic gene cluster. Sequence data and experimental evidence suggests that these genes encode a transport apparatus for PLT. The deduced amino acid sequences for four adjacent open reading frames together resemble Type I secretion apparatuses, which typically function in transport of proteins rather than secondary metabolites. The intact transporter genes are necessary for optimal PLT production. Taken together, the data from the studies described herein demonstrate that i) the production of PLT by Pf- 5 can affect the production of PLT by neighboring cells, and ii) PLT and other exogenous secondary metabolites have both autoregulatory and cross-regulatory effects in culture. Because Pf- 5 derivatives engaged in PLT <b>crossfeeding</b> in the rhizosphere, it is likely that cross-feeding occurs for other secondary metabolites as well. Thus, production of an antibiotic by one cell can profoundly affect secondary metabolism in neighboring cells occupying natural habitats...|$|R
