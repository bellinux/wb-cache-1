25|$|Byron's Sardanapalus {{was one of}} the {{literary}} sources – others include Diodorus Siculus and the Roman historian Quintus Curtius Rufus – of Eugène Delacroix' major historical painting La Mort de Sardanapale, completed between November 1827 and January 1828. It depicts the Assyrian king preparing for death surrounded by concubines, rather than in the company of Myrrha alone as Byron would have it. Thereafter the death of Sardanapalus became a favourite subject for composers, especially in France. In 1830 competitors for the Paris Conservatoire's Prix de Rome were given J.-F. Gail's La Mort de Sardanapale, a text based on Byron's play and Delacroix' painting, to set as a cantata. Hector Berlioz, in his fourth attempt on the prize, took the first prize. In the mid-1840s Franz Liszt conceived the idea of writing an opera based on Sardanapalus, and procured an Italian libretto to that purpose, but he did not actually begin writing until 1849, and seems to have given the project up during 1851. Though his opera was never finished, 111 pages of sketches for it still survive in Weimar's Liszt Museum. Several other Sardanapale operas based on Byron's play were completed by the composers Victorin de Joncières, Alphonse Duvernoy, Giulio Alary, and the Baronne de Maistre, and one was projected by the young Ildebrando Pizzetti. In 1901 the Prix de Rome committee selected Fernand Beissier's Myrrha, a pale imitation of Sardanapalus, as the text to be set. The prize was won by André <b>Caplet</b> on this occasion, but Maurice Ravel's entry {{is the only one of}} the 1901 entries to remain in the repertoire.|$|E
500|$|In music, Myrrha was {{the subject}} of an 1876 band piece by John Philip Sousa, Myrrha Gavotte and in 1901, Maurice Ravel and Andre <b>Caplet</b> each wrote cantatas titled Myrrha. <b>Caplet</b> {{finished}} first over Ravel who was third in the Prix de Rome competition. The competition required that the candidates jumped through a series of academic hoops before entering the final where they were to compose a cantata on a prescribed text. Though it was not the best musical piece, the jury praised Ravel's work for its [...] "melodic charm" [...] and [...] "sincerity of dramatic sentiment". Musical critic Andrew Clements writing for The Guardian commented on Ravel's failures at winning the competition: [...] "Ravel's repeated failure to win the Prix de Rome, the most coveted prize for young composers in France {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, has become part of musical folklore." ...|$|E

40|$|An Empirical Analysis In {{this paper}} we empirically analyze {{and compare the}} Libor and Swap Market Models, {{developed}} by Brace, Gatarek, and Musiela (1997) and Jamshidian (1997), using paneldata on prices of US <b>caplets</b> and swaptions. A Libor Market Model can directly be calibrated to observed prices of <b>caplets,</b> whereas a Swap Market Model is calibrated to a certain set of swaption prices. For both one-factor and two-factor models we analyze how well they price <b>caplets</b> and swaptions that were not used for calibration. We show that the Libor Market Models in general lead to better prediction of derivative prices that were not used for calibration than the Swap Market Models. A one-factor Libor Market Model that exhibits mean-reversion gives a good fit of the derivative prices, and adding a second factor only decreases pricing errors to a small extent.

40|$|In this paper, we {{deal with}} no-arbitrage pricing {{problems}} of a chooser flexible cap (floor) written on an underlying LIBOR. The chooser flexible cap (floor) allows a right for a buyer to exercise a limited and pre-determined number of the interim period <b>caplets</b> (floorlets) in a multiple-period cap (floor) agreement. Assuming a common diffusion short rate dynamics, e. g., Hull-White model, we propose a dynamic programming approach for their risk neutral evaluation.

We model a numeraire process and multiplicative spreads between Libor rates and simply compounded OIS rates as functions of an underlying affine process. Besides allowing for ordered spreads and an exact {{fit to the}} initially observed term structures, this general framework leads to tractable valuation formulas for <b>caplets</b> and swaptions and embeds all existing multi-curve affine models. The proposed approach also gives rise to new developments, such as a short rate type model driven by a Wishart process, for which we derive a closed-form pricing formula for <b>caplets.</b> The empirical performance of two specifications of our framework is illustrated by calibration to market data...|$|R

The two components of this process represent the global supply and demand for fixed income instruments. In this framework, closed form expressions are obtained for the first moments of the short term rate and for bonds, under an equivalent affine risk neutral measure. European derivatives are priced under a forward measure and a numerical algorithm is proposed to evaluate <b>caplets</b> and floorlets. The model is fitted to the time series of one year swap rates, from 2004 to 2014.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a fast and robust method for {{calibrating}} the <b>caplets</b> is introduced. The conventional method for calibrating the parameters generally minimizes the error between the model {{data and the}} market data. The brute force method is robust but too slow for practical use. Other searching methods such as the Nelder-Mead method is fast but not robust enough for high dimensional problems. As there are 3 parameters to calibrate in the stochastic LIBOR model, a new method is required. The proposed method is innovative because it solves the parameters numerically, which avoids the time consuming method in brute force and instability in searching. The proposed method is a two stage process, which combines the newly invented method and the existing knowledge in minimization. Under some reasonable assumptions, the proposed method can generally work for such kinds of problems and calibrate the <b>caplets</b> instantly...|$|R
