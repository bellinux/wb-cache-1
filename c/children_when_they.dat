5|$|Kesler's {{success as}} a player has been {{attributed}} to his competitiveness and desire to outwork opposing players. Kesler has recognized, however, that his competitive drive has often caused him to lose his composure. In the 2010 off-season, Canucks management encouraged him to play with more focus, maintaining his emotions and decreasing physical and verbal confrontation with opposing players. During the subsequent 2010–11 campaign, he gained media attention for changing his play accordingly while enjoying the best season of his career. Kesler has also credited the change with his role as a father, wanting to set a mature example for his <b>children</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> watch him play.|$|E
5|$|Under French law, both Sally and James {{could have}} petitioned for their freedom, as the 1789 revolutionary {{constitution}} in France abolished slavery in principle. Hemings had {{the legal right}} to remain in France as a free person; if she returned to Virginia with Jefferson, it would be as a slave. According to her son Madison's memoir, Hemings became pregnant by Jefferson in Paris. She was about 16 at the time. She agreed to return with him to the United States based on his promise to free their <b>children</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> reached the age of 21 years. Hemings' strong ties to her mother, siblings and extended family probably drew her back to Monticello.|$|E

25|$|Nuer girls usually marry at 17 or 18. If a {{young girl}} gets engaged at an early age, the wedding and consummation ceremonies are {{essentially}} delayed. Women generally give birth to their first <b>children</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are mature enough to bear them. As long as a girl marries a man with cattle, she pretty much has the free will to choose her mate. Now, her parents can choose a mate for her, but they ask for her consent. It is quite tough for parents to force their daughter to marry a man she isn't attracted to or simply dislikes. Nuer girls do stand up against being pressured by family {{when it comes to}} marriage issues.|$|E
25|$|Ford's {{first wife}} was actress and dancer Eleanor Powell (1943–1959), {{with whom he}} had his only child, actor Peter Ford (born 1945).

Ford dated Christiane Schmidtmer during the mid-1960s, but subsequently married actress Kathryn Hays (1966–1969); Cynthia Hayward (1977–1984), and Jeanne Baus (1993–1994). All four marriages ended in divorce. Ford was not on good terms with his ex-wives, except for Cynthia Hayward, with whom he remained close until his death. He also had a long-term relationship with actress Hope Lange in the early 1960s, although they never married.|$|E
25|$|The British Band {{had three}} key leaders, Black Hawk, the Ho-Chunk prophet Wabokieshiek (White Cloud), and Neapope.

The band was composed of about 500 warriors and 1,000 old men, women and <b>children</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> crossed the Mississippi on 5 April.

25|$|In 1873, {{the issue}} {{received}} renewed, widespread attention after publication {{of an interview}} with Madison Hemings, who asserted that Jefferson was his father. He was interviewed about {{his life as a}} slave at Monticello, and his account was published in an Ohio newspaper. Then age 68, Hemings claimed Jefferson as his and his siblings' father. He said that when Jefferson and Sally Hemings were still in Paris, she became pregnant with his child. Based on Jefferson's promise to free her <b>children</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> came of age, she returned with him to the United States from France, where slavery had been banned. Israel Jefferson, also a former slave of Monticello, confirmed the account of Jefferson's paternity of Hemings' children in his own interview published that year by the same Ohio newspaper. Critics attacked the newspaper account as politically motivated and the former slaves as mistaken, or worse.|$|E
25|$|The {{first school}} on the site was a schoolroom for 200 boys and 100 girls. It was founded in 1810 by local lawyer William Wilshere in a disused malthouse. This schoolroom was the first monitorial school for {{the sons of the}} poor in Hertfordshire. Teaching was based on Joseph Lancaster's methods of monitorial teaching. He {{developed}} a system in which large numbers of younger scholars could be taught by older scholars {{under the supervision of the}} master (for boys) or mistress (for girls). This method continued until the Revised Code of 1862 that brought in the Pupil Teacher method of teaching. The monitorial system was changed as it was the general consensus that having children teach other <b>children,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are not well educated themselves, proved to be problematic. The Pupil Teacher method involved an older scholar being given training and being paid to teach. The government hoped that this would increase the number of teachers in the future, using a system that could be described as an apprenticeship in teaching.|$|E

Ma Chao had a second wife, Lady Dong (董氏), who bore him a son, Ma Qiu (馬秋). When Ma Chao escaped from Zhang Lu and defected to Liu Bei, he left them behind in Hanzhong Commandery. Zhang Lu was later defeated by Cao Cao, to whom he surrendered. Cao Cao gave Lady Dong to Yan Pu (閻圃), a former adviser to Zhang Lu, and gave Ma Qiu to Zhang Lu. Zhang Lu personally killed Ma Qiu. It is not known who the mother(s) of Ma Chao's two other children (Ma Cheng and the daughter) were, but she (or they) was probably neither Lady Yang nor Lady Dong.|$|E

25|$|Many gay men {{and lesbians}} had children, {{especially}} if they had been previously married. Over 50 per cent of homosexuals who had been married had <b>children.</b> <b>When</b> <b>they</b> asked homosexuals whether they would be disturbed if their own children became homosexual, between 25 and 33 per cent said yes. Between 69 and 77 per cent said {{that they would not be}} upset, or only a little upset, if one of their children became homosexual. Compared to heterosexuals, homosexuals were much less likely to marry: 25 per cent of homosexuals married and 75 per cent did not, while for heterosexuals, the proportions were roughly reversed. When homosexuals did marry, they had less heterosexual intercourse and fewer children than heterosexuals. Some other findings were that 1 per cent of gay men were attracted to feminine qualities in a man, that gay men had little interest in competitive sport, and that older gay men were more likely than younger gay men to concentrate on fellatio. Bell and Weinberg were unable to explain the finding about sport, and were wary of concluding that the differences in sexual behavior between older and younger gay men represented a shift in sexual mores.|$|E
25|$|Families tend to {{seek out}} schools whose {{principal}} languages they share, and ideally one which mirrors their own educational system. Many countries have American schools, French schools, British schools, German Schools and 'International Schools' which often follow {{one of the three}} International Baccalaureate programs. These will be populated by expatriates' children and some children of the local upper middle class. They do this in an effort to maintain linguistic stability and to ensure that their children do not fall behind due to linguistic problems. Where their own language is not available, families will often choose English-speaking schools for their children. They do this because of the linguistic and cultural opportunities being immersed in English might provide their <b>children</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are adults, and because their children {{are more likely to have}} prior exposure to English than to other international languages. This poses the potential for non-English speaking TCKs to have a significantly different experience from TCKs for whom English is a native language. Research on TCKs from Japan, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the United States and Africa has shown that TCKs from different countries share more in common with other TCKs than they do with their own peer group from their passport country.|$|E

500|$|This {{ligament}} is {{an important}} anatomical landmark of the duodenojejunal flexure, separating {{the upper and lower}} gastrointestinal tracts.

In contrast, hematochezia, bright red blood or clots in the stool, usually indicates gastrointestinal bleeding from {{the lower part of the}} gastrointestinal tract. It is an especially important landmark to note when looking at the bowel for the presence of malrotation of the gut, a syndrome often suspected in young <b>children</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> have episodes of recurrent vomiting.
