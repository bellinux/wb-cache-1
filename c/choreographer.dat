40|$|Queer Transgressions: The choreographing {{of a male}} {{homosexual}} presence {{with reference}} to selected <b>choreographers</b> explores queer identity and in particular representations of a male homosexual presence in dance. Within the methodological framework of dance studies and queer theory I explore the ―self fashioning‖ of my male homosexual presence in dance. This is achieved by critically deconstructing my choreographic process when making choreography. Therefore this thesis is informed by both academic research and my self-reflexive experience of choreography and dance performance. The deconstruction of my autobiography and choreographic process is discussed with reference to both international and South African queer <b>choreographers.</b> This means that by accounting for my own experiences and approaches toward representing a male homosexual presence in dance, I explore the history and engagements of other queer <b>choreographers</b> also creating such representations. I therefore examine the works of selected <b>choreographers</b> and chart {{the development of the}} representation of a male homosexual presence in dance. By exploring the choreographic process of other queer <b>choreographers</b> I identify choreographic tactics that queer <b>choreographers</b> are using when making work. From this point of departure I shift the focus away from international queer <b>choreographers</b> and provide insight into the choreographic processes of South African queer <b>choreographers.</b> By accounting for the works and choreographic processes of South African <b>choreographers,</b> I provide a context in which my choreographic explorations on the subject matter can take place. This choreographic exploration manifests itself through a self-reflexive/autobiographic account on the research and practice of my choreographic process. During my choreographic exploration I set the challenge to both engage with and explore further, established ―queering tactics. This is done with the intention to reveal and create representations of a male homosexual presence in dance...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I wish {{to examine the}} ways in which several Australian <b>choreographers</b> have {{explored}} a variety of possible relationships between music and dance in their work. By examining their work and ideas I will show how they have each individually met the hallenge offered by modern dance by finding new relationships between the two art forms. I will focus on four Australian <b>choreographers</b> - Helen Herbertson, Don Asker, Beth Shelton and Sue Healey. Although these <b>choreographers</b> represent a fairly small cross section of the world of contemporary dance in Australia, I feel that their work reveals a diversity of approaches. On the basis of personal interviews with the <b>choreographers</b> about their work and an examination of other materials (videos, program notes. etc.) I will discuss how they, as <b>choreographers,</b> perceive the 'role' of music and how they incorporate it into their work...|$|R
