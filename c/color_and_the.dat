5|$|Tall {{and slender}} forms of Mycena polygramma {{somewhat}} resemble M.pullata or M.praelonga. The former species is distinguished by its <b>color,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> latter by {{its relationship to}} M.alcalina and its habitat on sphagnum.|$|E
5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis {{differs from}} other boletes in the {{covering}} of the cap, which superficially resembles that {{found on the}} surface of Boletellus ananas and Strobilomyces strobilaceus, but the scales are more rigid with a somewhat conical shape. It can be distinguished from these two species by both its bay-brown <b>color,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> absence of a veil. Both of the other species mentioned possess a conspicuous veil, and the former is tan to brown with a pinkish tint, while the latter is dark brown or black. Boletus edulis is separated from A.mirabilis by the color and texture of the cap, tubes and stem. Boletus coniferarum turns blue when bruised and has a very bitter taste. Aureoboletus projectellus is also similar in appearance to Aureoboletus mirabilis, but is found in eastern North America.|$|E

5|$|In Ancient Greece, {{green and}} blue were {{sometimes}} considered the same <b>color,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> same word sometimes described {{the color of the}} sea and the color of trees. The philosopher Democritus described two different greens: cloron, or pale green, and prasinon, or leek green. Aristotle considered that green was located midway between black, symbolizing the earth, and white, symbolizing water. However, green was not counted among the four classic colors of Greek painting – red, yellow, black and white – and is rarely found in Greek art.|$|E
5|$|Rhodotus is a genus in {{the fungus}} family Physalacriaceae. It is a {{monotypic}} genus {{and consists of}} the single mushroom species Rhodotus palmatus, known in the vernacular as the netted rhodotus, the rosy veincap, or the wrinkled peach. This uncommon species has a circumboreal distribution, and has been collected in eastern North America, northern Africa, Europe, and Asia; declining populations in Europe have led to its appearance in {{over half of the}} European fungal Red Lists of threatened species. Typically found growing on the stumps and logs of rotting hardwoods, mature specimens may usually be identified by the pinkish <b>color</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> distinctive ridged and veined surface of their rubbery caps; variations in the color and quantity of light received during development lead to variations in the size, shape, and cap color of fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Salinity {{differences}} between the sections of the lake separated by the railroad causeway result in significantly different biota. A phytoplankton community dominated by green algae or cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) tint the water south of the causeway a greenish color. North of the causeway, the lake is dominated by Dunaliella salina, a species of algae which releases beta-carotene, and the bacteria-like haloarchaea, which together give the water an unusual reddish or purplish <b>color,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bacteria converts non-toxic mercury into toxic methyl mercury, which then flows into the Southern portion of the lake in a heavy brine layer through the causeway.|$|E

5|$|The dark bluish-green <b>color</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> widely spaced, deeply cut and {{indented}} pinnae differentiate A.montanum {{from most}} related species. The pinnae of Bradley's spleenwort (A.bradleyi) are toothed and less deeply cut, {{and the dark}} color of the stipe continues partway up the rachis in that species. Wall-rue (A.ruta-muraria) has a green stipe, and its pinnae have longer stalks and are broadest near the tip. Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi), a hybrid between Bradley's spleenwort and mountain spleenwort, is intermediate between its parents. When compared with mountain spleenwort, the blade of Wherry's spleenwort is lance-shaped, rather than triangular; the upper parts of the blade are not as deeply cut; and the dark color of the stipe extends {{to the beginning of}} the rachis.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} print runs used Thayer and Company lithographers, with one litho stone for the <b>color</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other for {{printing}} black {{on the white}} paper stock. Because the paper of 1840's through 1890's included a lavish amount of fiber, often taken from mummy wrappings, it would not fade or decompose like the wood pulp paper used today. The first print run copied the Laurie and Whittles game. Laurie and Whittles used gold ink. Thayer mixed his ink to look gold but {{it really was a}} goldish brown. Like Laurie and Whittles game, Thayer used an octagonal end space.|$|E
5|$|The holy hill {{is drawn}} in the {{backdrop}} with four faces painted with different colors – the east face is in crystal white color, the south face is yellow, {{the west is}} in red <b>color</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> north has green color. The palace has four sides and eight corners with its lower and upper tiers adorned with jewels. The courtyard with four enclosures is said to represent four kinds of conduct. The walls are built with bricks, balconies have been bejewelled with religious symbols. The ambience {{is shown in the}} form of wishing trees, fountains of the water of life, rain bows in five colors with cloud formations and light emanating from lotus flowers. The palace is also shown with a throne with eight corners fully and curiously bejewelled. Padmasmbahva is shown sitting on a pure stalk of lotus emitting divine energy appearing “divine, charitable, powerful, or fierce”.|$|E

25|$|Samphire {{is usually}} cooked, either steamed or microwaved, and then coated in butter or olive oil. Due to its high salt content, {{it must be}} cooked without any salt added, in plenty of water. It has a hard, stringy core, and after cooking, the edible flesh is pulled off from the core. This flesh, after cooking, resembles seaweed in <b>color,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> flavor and texture are like young spinach stems or asparagus. Samphire is often used as a {{suitably}} maritime accompaniment to fish or seafood.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{elements}} of art—the line, particle of color—like words could be treated autonomously, each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, if so chose the artist.
