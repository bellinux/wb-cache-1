It is a rectangular, one-story brick structure. The exterior walls are constructed of brick, stone and mortar, with ornate wood soffit, extended wood fascia, and Spanish style <b>ceramic</b> <b>roof</b> <b>tile,</b> topped with large tile caps. Passenger service ceased in 1968, and in 1994, it was purchased from CSX by the Tunnelton Historical Society.|$|E

As collateral benefits, the use of granite waste and coffee husk ash as alternative raw materials in the manufacture of clay-based products will relieve the stress on feldspars consumption and attenuate waste disposal concerns...|$|E

In this study {{the aim is to}} design and produce corrugated laterite based roof tile and investigate its water absorption and penetration. Paste of laterite-cement mix was formed with water to cement ratio of 3 : 1. The percentage composition of the cement used was 15 % and 20 %. The paste was poured into a wooden frame (dimension of 200 mm x 300 mm x 20 mm) with an underlying corrugated metal sheet, while another corrugated metal sheet was placed on the paste to ensure formation of the corrugated shape on both sides. Water analysis carried out on the cast samples showed that the sample with 20 % cement composition had a better resistance to water absorption and penetration. The result of this study indicates that the formation of corrugated roofing tile using laterite material is feasible and it is possible to have good water resistant property if fully optimized...|$|E

By alternating the operating parameters of vacuum extruder, the characteristics of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> have been changed and a stable ceramic structure (3 rd series, low water permeability, dominant pore diameter range: 0. 5 – 1. 0 µm) is formed.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship of}} certain red <b>ceramic</b> <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> properties to <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> biodeterioration. The following properties were studied: apparent porosity, roughness, and {{the presence or absence}} of two types of coatings. The effect of apparent porosity was studied by varying the peak firing temperature of a standard industrial red <b>ceramic</b> <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> composition and by preparing several clay mixtures, of different chemical and mineralogical composition, that were fired at various peak temperatures. The effect of <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> roughness was determined by either polishing or sanding fired standard red <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles.</b> A waterproof <b>ceramic</b> glaze coating and a photocatalytic coating were formulated to analyse the effect of the presence of different types of coatings. <b>Roofing</b> <b>tile</b> bioreceptivity was evaluated with a method developed in a previous study using the cyanobacteria Oscillatoria sp, which enabled <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> resistance to microbial colonization to be determined. As expected, bioreceptivity rose as apparent porosity (measured as water absorption) increased, enabling possible water retention, which favours biological growth. Similarly, greater roughness encouraged micro-organism adhesion and 2 raised bioreceptivity. It was found that, after prolonged exposure periods (several months) under very favourable conditions for biological colonization, <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> coated with the waterproof ceramic glaze were colonized. However, glazed standard red <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> covered with a TiO 2 photocatalytic coating exhibited practically no biological growth under the test conditions used, even after long exposure times, owing to the chemical-physical effect of the TiO 2 -based coating...|$|R

40|$|Biodeterioration {{damage is}} an {{important}} issue in conservation and restoration of built heritage, especially when ceramic materials are used. Biological colonization of <b>ceramic</b> <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> by lichens is a common phenomenon. However, there are no reports to date of lichens removal from unglazed <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> for conservation purposes. This paper for the first time reveals the results of a combined procedure undertaken to assess the removal of lichens on different kinds of unglazed <b>ceramic</b> <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> by treatments based on both dual sequential laser irradiation and treatment using Acticide CF biocide. Three species of lichens were identified: Verrucaria nigrescens, Calogaya decipiens and Pyrenodesmia teicholyta. The chemical and mineralogical composition of <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> were characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry, optical polarized petrographic microscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Laser irradiation was accomplished by applying sequences of nanosecond laser pulses at two wavelengths (1064 and 266 nm). After dual sequential laser irradiation a biocide was applied. To assess the combined effect of both treatments several techniques were used, including stereo and fluorescence (FM) microscopies, scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopies, and FT-Raman spectroscopy. Chemical composition of the analyzed <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> was shown as a relevant factor regarding the degree of interaction between the biological colonization and the substrate, and hence, the bioweathering effect. The combined procedure has proved to be very effective in ablating cortical layers in all species, or even complete areolae in V. nigrescens, enhancing biocide effect in the thalli of C. decipiens and P. teicholyta, and producing the complete damage of both bionts.

First, a method of determining the soluble salts was developed, optimising the extraction method and fine-tuning an anion measurement method by ionic chromatography. Secondly, the changes in solubility, as well as the chemical and structural changes that occurred when the raw materials were subjected to firing, were studied. Finally, the efflorescences of a group of unfired and fired <b>ceramic</b> <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> were characterised, in order to relate them to the quantity and type of soluble salts contained. &# 13; The study concludes {{that it is necessary to}} conduct solubility tests on fired samples under real conditions, since important structural changes occur in the firing process, which lead to considerable variations in the soluble salts. Furthermore, in addition to analysing Na(I), K(I), and Mg(II) as indicated in the standard, it is advisable to determine Ca(II) and SO 4 2 -, since these are the major components in the efflorescences. La aparición de eflorescencias constituye un serio problema para la calidad de las tejas cerámicas ya que afectan a las características técnicas y estéticas de éstas.
