40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{assessment}} {{was to determine if}} the application of retro-reflective graphics material in conjunction with <b>contour</b> <b>markings</b> to the side face of heavy and long vehicles and their trailers could result in disability glare. Disability glare is the reduction in the ability to see objects due to bright light sources in the visual field. It was assessed in this study by measuring {{the extent to which the}} presence of a pedestrian on the road between the truck and an approaching driver could be detected. For reference, the Draft Regulation XA defines <b>contour</b> <b>markings</b> as ‘a series of rectangular strips intended to be placed in such a way that it shows the contour of the vehicle to the side or rear’. Graphics markings are ‘additional coloured markings intended to be placed within the contour marking’ which are of a lower retro-reflective performance than the <b>contour</b> <b>markings...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Multiple design {{variations}} {{are possible}} {{but the most}} common example of a slide plate (in structural applications) has glass-filled PTFE [...] bonded to a steel backing plate. In these applications a two-part system is used which has an <b>upper</b> <b>element</b> with stainless steel surface face-down and bearing on a lower element with its PTFE steel backing surface face-up. [...] In most applications, the <b>upper</b> <b>element</b> {{is larger than the}} lower element by the amount of movement expected. This has a two-fold advantage of maintaining a constant bearing area and preventing the lower surface from being exposed to dirt, grit or other contaminants throughout the range of motion.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-A {{traditional}} {{approach to the}} problem of human object recognition is to assume that the visual system represents an object in terms of invariant quantities. This study considers a generalization of this approach {{to the problem of}} visually recognizing differences in shape, specifically between <b>contour</b> <b>markings</b> on a planar surface, as the position of the surface varies in space. For a given 'shape cue', perceived differences in contour may be quantified by threshold values-Weber fractions-at a particular criterion level of performance. A necessary theoretical condition for the Weber fraction to be constant with the relative viewpoint of the observer is that the cue should be a relative invariant under the natural spatial transformations of the image. Some data are reviewed showing how statistically efficient some cues are in explaining the observed discriminability of symmetric curved contours at a fixed criterion performance level of 75 %. A new, fuller analysis is presented showing that the efficiency of the most efficient cue satisfying the invariance condition is maintained over a wide range of criterion performance levels, from 53 % to 92 % correct, corresponding to discrimination index values of 0. 1 to 2. 0. Over these levels, Weber's law was found empirically to hold almost exactly. 1...|$|R

50|$|Most {{electric}} {{water heaters}} use electric resistance elements {{to heat the}} water in the storage tank using two electric resistance elements, which are located at the bottom and top of the storage tank. Each element is controlled by an independent thermostat.
