ABSTRACT: This study sought to investigate {{the factors that influence}} access to debt finance by Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) in Chwele Town, Bungoma County. The categories of firms under study were all registered MSEs in operation at the time. The study examined the following objectives: to determine the effect of <b>Collateral</b> <b>security</b> on access to debt finance, to establish effect of financial information on access to debt finance and to determine the effect of managerial competence on access to debt finance. The study employed a descriptive research design. The target population was 256 MSEs from which a sample size of 120 MSEs was selected using Nassiuma (2000) formula. Data was collected using self-administered questionnaires. The raw data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression. The first study objective sought to establish the relationship between the <b>Collateral</b> <b>security</b> and access to debt finance by MSEs in Chwele Township. It was established that most of the respondents had not pledged <b>Collateral</b> <b>security</b> for finance while. Most of the indicated that the nature of the <b>Collateral</b> <b>security</b> offered was private property which included their land.

Four of the most used steady state <b>security</b> <b>margins</b> are the power flow feasibility margin, the contingency feasibility margin, the load margin to voltage collapse, and the total transfer capability between system areas. A comprehensive literature survey has shown that these <b>security</b> <b>margins</b> have been studied separately. This fact has suggested to the authors the possibility of researching a common analysis framework valid for all of them. This is the first part of a two-part paper. In part I, a novel mathematical formulation valid to address the study of any steady state <b>security</b> <b>margin</b> is proposed. The developed general approach is presented in three steps: (a) formulation, (b) computation, and (c) improvement of <b>security</b> <b>margins.</b> In part II, the performance of the proposed approach when used to compute and improve the aforementioned steady <b>security</b> <b>margins</b> is illustrated through its application to the Spanish power system.

40|$|In the operation, {{planning}} and design of the transmission system it is of greatest concern to quantify the reliability <b>security</b> <b>margin</b> to unwanted conditions. The deterministic N- 1 criterion has traditionally provided this <b>security</b> <b>margin</b> to reduce the consequences of severe conditions such as widespread blackouts. However, a deterministic criterion {{does not include the}} likelihood of different outage events. Moreover, experience from blackouts shows, e. g. in Sweden-Denmark September 2003, that the outages were not captured by the N- 1 criterion. The question addressed in this thesis is how this system <b>security</b> <b>margin</b> can be quantified with probabilistic methods. A quantitative measure provides one valuable input to the decision-making process of selecting e. g. system expansions alternatives and maintenance actions in the {{planning and}} design phases. It is also beneficial for the operators in the control room to assess the associated <b>security</b> <b>margin</b> of existing and future network conditions. This thesis presents a method that assesses each component's risk to an insufficient transfer capability in the transmission system. This shows on each component's importance to the system <b>security</b> <b>margin.</b> It provides a systematic analysis and ranking of outage events' risk of overloading critical transfer sections (CTS) in the system. The severity of each critical event is quantified in a risk index based on the likelihood of the event and the consequence of the section's transmission capacity. This enables a comparison of the risk of a frequent outage event with small CTS consequences, with a rare event with large consequences. The developed approach has been applied for the generally known Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS). The result shows that the ranking of the components is highly dependent on the substation modelling and the studied system load level. With the restriction of only evaluating the risks to the transfer capability in a few CTSs, the method provides a quantitative ranking of the potential risks to the system <b>security</b> <b>margin</b> at different load levels. Consequently, the developed reliability based approach provides information which could improve the deterministic criterion for transmission system planning...|$|R

In this paper, a method based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is developed to estimate the <b>security</b> <b>margin.</b> The <b>security</b> <b>margin</b> for a given power system is obtained by applying standard operations criteria for transient response to off-line time simulations.

The proposed MOLC approach optimizes the two objectives simultaneous, namely the <b>security</b> <b>margin</b> and load curtailment cost. The <b>security</b> <b>margin</b> is measured by a presented voltage instability indictor (VSI). A fitting coefficient is adopted to combine the two conflicted objectives. The primal dual interior point method (PDIPM) is adopted to solve the proposed MOLC model. The effectiveness of both the improved PDIPM and the MOLC approach has been tested and proven on the modified IEEE 30 -bus system and IEEE 118 -bus system.

40|$|Abstract: In recent years, {{research}} {{efforts have been}} focused to estimating voltage <b>security</b> <b>margins.</b> Voltage <b>security</b> <b>margin</b> shows how close the current operating of a power system is to a voltage collapse point. One main disadvantage of these techniques is that they require {{a large amount of}} computations, therefore they are not efficient for on-line use in power control centers. Therefore the intelligent networks classification techniques for systems that are illustrated by series of data are offered. In this paper, two methods are used to estimate voltage <b>security</b> <b>margin.</b> The first method is general fuzzy minmax neural network (GFMM NNs.) with on-line adaptation. The second method which we named it as “Fuzzy Self-Organizing Network, ” combines two structures of Kohonen and GFMM neural network then by using Akaike criterion the optimal values of the proposed network parameters are determined. The data set needed for training this structure is obtained from the minimum singular value of the power flow Jacobian matrix. These methods are applied on the IEEE 30 -bus system with 2000 simulated data randomly generated from different operating conditions. Finally, the results compared with the three-layer feed forward neural network as the most common used neural networks. The results clearly show the advantage and high efficiency of the proposed structure.
