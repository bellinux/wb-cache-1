40|$|Epstein Barr virus (EBV) {{is one of}} the {{ubiquitous}} viral carcinogens found in humans and successfully infects more than 90 % of the world population. The spectrum of EBV-related pathology ranges from asymptomatic primary infection to grave B- and T-cell malignancies. EBV triggers lymphoproliferative disorders after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which contributes to higher mortality rates. Although the transmission of EBV primarily occurs from an infected host to a naive host through viral shedding from the oropharynx, increasing evidence points to considerable amount of shedding in other anatomical sites such as cervix, anal mucosa, breast milk and respiratory tract. It is impossible to eradicate the prevalence of EBV-related malignancies and other pathologies without preventing viral shedding. However, a detail analysis of the multifaceted nature of EBV shedding is not available in the literature. Thus, this review focuses on elucidating the key elements of the shedding dynamics of this <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>virus.</b> © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a {{well-known}} <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>virus,</b> and the association of EBV with some tumours suggests that {{there may also be}} an association between laryngeal carcinoma and EBV. ObjectiveThe aim {{of this study is to}} determine the role of EBV in the aetiology of laryngeal carcinoma. MethodProspective investigation the EBV with real time polymerase chain reaction in tumour tissues of 25 patients with laryngeal carcinoma and 17 patients with benign laryngeal lesions, and investigation of the relationship between the presence of viral DNA and patients’ smoking habits, alcohol consumption, localization and differentiation of the tumour. ResultsThere was no significant difference between the control group and patient group in terms of EBV polymerase chain reaction positivity (p > 0. 05). Also we couldn't find a statistically significant relationship between EBV positivity and differentiation of the tumour, localization of the tumour, smoking and alcohol consumption habits (p > 0. 05). ConclusionOur results suggest that, although EBV is present in some of the squamous cell laryngeal carcinomas, its presence has no effect on the pathogenesis of laryngeal carcinomas...|$|E
40|$|Many unknown {{species of}} human DNA viruses have {{recently}} (2005 - 2013) been discovered by using modern molecular and bioinformatic tools. The clinical and pathogenic roles of these viruses are presently known only fragmentarily; however {{they were found}} in symptomatic patients, and some {{have been shown to}} cause severe infectious illness, or cancer. Some of these emerging DNA viruses are examined in this thesis: Human Bocavirus 1 (HBoV 1), Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV or MCPyV) and Trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated polyomavirus (TSV or TSPyV). Viruses like these are of fundamental importance in the genesis of not only of acute but also of chronic or late-onset illness. The immunobiology and pathogenesis of these new viruses along with the already known DNA virus (parvovirus B 19 or B 19) can be found by the immunological and molecular methods. For years it was thought that parvovirus B 19, was the sole human-pathogen among its family members. In 2005 a new pathogenic species, HBoV 1 (previously denoted HBoV), was discovered by random-PCR from a nasopharyngeal aspirate. The existing data strongly suggest that HBoV 1 causes a respiratory illness in young children. The aim of our study was to increase our knowledge on HBoV 1 -specific Th-cell immunity by examining T-cell proliferation and cytokine responses in asymptomatic adults. HBoV 1 -specific response was compared to those elicited by B 19. B 19 -specific Th-cell immunity appears to be more divergent (in terms of cytokine response patterns) than the HBoV 1 -specific one. The present study also suggests that interleukin- 13 (IL- 13) response induced by HBoV 1 may contribute to the airway pathology like asthma or bronchiolitis. A novel concept of CD 4 + T-cells with cytolytic potential (CD 4 + CTL) is emerging. Very recently, CD 4 + CTL have been implicated in the control of persistent viral infections, e. g., Epistein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV- 1. While human parvovirus B 19 can establish persistence, yet no data exist on the presence of B 19 -specific CD 4 + CTLs. Detection of vigorous B 19 -specific granzyme B (GrB) and perforin responses in seropositive individuals points to a role of CD 4 + CTL also in B 19 immunity. Such cells could function within immune regulation and in the triggering of autoimmune phenomena such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The newly discovered MCV resides in approximately 80 % of Merkel cell carcinomas (MCC). The integration of MCV genome in-to the genome of host cell has been suggested to be the primary reason for this rare and aggressive skin cancer. Here we studied the T-cell immunity against this <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>virus.</b> We found that interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is the dominant cytokine among MCV-seropositive individuals and suggest that IFN-γ {{plays an important role in}} surveillance against MCV-induced disease. Our studies also suggested a role for IL- 13 and IL- 10 in anti-tumor immunity and immune regulation, respectively. TSV, while exhibiting high seroprevalence in general population, has been detected in trichodysplasia spinulosa (TS) skin lesions, suggesting an etiological role in this disease. In order to characterize Th-cell immunity against TSV, and to permit its comparisons with MCV-specific Th-cell immunity, we studied TSV and MCV-specific proliferation and cytokine responses in healthy volunteers and in one MCC patient. While an association between humoral and cellular responses was detectable with MCV, it was found to be weaker than the humoral and cellular responses detectable with TSV. Despite the significant homology in amino acid sequences of VP 1, Th-cell crossreactivity was not evident between these viruses. As CD 8 + T-cells specific for MCV LT-Ag oncoprotein clearly provide an important defence mechanism against MCC, the MCV VP 1 -specific Th-cells may also be important in preventing the oncogenic process, by suppressing MCV replication with antiviral cytokines such as IFN-γ. Parvoviruses (HBoV 1 and B 19) and polyomaviruses (MCV and TSV) induce effector CD 4 + T-cell responses that are best known for their ability to protect against viral infections. Besides helper functions, CD 4 + T-cell contribute to viral control and elimination by CD 4 -mediated cytotoxic effector functions. Thus, understanding of the CD 4 + T-cell immunity is of key importance in the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents against life threatening infectious pathogens. Not availabl...|$|E

40|$|Head-and-neck {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, and its incidence is growing. Although environmental carcinogens and <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>viruses</b> are the main etiologic factors, genetic predisposition obviously plays a risk-modulating role, given that not all individuals exposed to these carcinogens experience the disease. This review highlights some aspects of genetic susceptibility to HNSCC: among others, genetic polymorphisms in biotransformation enzymes, DNA repair pathway, apoptotic pathway, human papillomavirus-related pathways, mitochondrial polymorphisms, and polymorphism related to the bilirubin-metabolized pathway. Furthermore, epigenetic variations, familial forms of HNSCC, functional assays for HNSCC risk assessment, and the implications and perspectives of research on genetic susceptibility in HNSCC are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV), {{also known}} as human herpes virus 8 (HHV- 8) {{is one of the}} several <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>viruses</b> that infect humans. KSHV infection has been implicated in the development of Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and multicentric Castleman’s Disease (MCD). While KSHV infection is necessary for the development of KSHV associated malignancies, it is not sufficient to induce tumoriegenesis. Evidently, other co-factors are essential for the progression of KSHV induced malignancies. One of the most important co-factors, necessary for the progression of KSHV induced tumors, is immune suppression that frequently arises during co-infection with HIV and also by other immune suppressants. In this mini-review, we discuss the roles of co-infection with HIV and other pathogens on KSHV infection and pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{alone is}} thought to cause ~ 610, 000 cases of cancer per year, and is the dominant aetiological agent for ano-genital (esp. cervical) and head and neck cancers (esp. oropharyngeal). Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) is a more recently discovered virus which causes Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare but highly aggressive skin malignancy. Methods: We explored the available published evidence to see if transmission of live HPV or MCV virus in smoke generated by laser or diathermy was feasible, and would pose an infection risk. Long-term infection with such <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>viruses</b> would then pose an increased risk {{for the development of}} virus-induced cancers in medical personnel. Results: The morphological structures of both HPV and MCV are very similar, and the size, external capsids and genomic structures show striking similarity. Both viruses have a non-enveloped external protein capsid consisting of 72 capsomeres, and a double-stranded DNA core. Sizes of both viruses range from 50 to 60 nm. There are now recent data demonstrating live and infectious HPV in smoke, and that these viruses can be used to infect cells in vitro. Further, anecdotal reports of virus transmission leading to disease causation in the production of respiratory airway viral warts (benign disease), and, finally, reports of HPV-induced oropharyngeal carcinoma (malignant disease) in two gynaecological surgeons as an occupational health hazard have been published recently. Conclusion: There is now sufficient evidence to support the hypotheses that live infectious <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>viruses</b> can be transmitted via smoke generated from surgical procedures, and, in rare instances, actually cause significant disease. Protective measures such as smoke extraction and airway protection should be instituted for all healthcare personnel, particularly those with multiple repeated exposures such as gynaecological surgeons...|$|R
40|$|A {{model system}} is {{described}} {{for the mass}} propagation of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus, utilizing large-volume fermentor units for suspension culture of tissue cells and the subsequent production of virus. Comparisons between laboratory- and fermentor-scale operations of tissue cell growth gave equivalent results. Cell viability dropped 24 to 30 hr postinfection with a subsequent virus yield between 108. 0 and 109. 0 mouse intracerebral median lethal doses per milliliter. Infecting volumes of tissue cell culture (20 - or 40 -liter working volumes) had no apparent effect on virus yields. Tissue cells grown under either oxidation-reduction potential- and pH-controlled or uncontrolled conditions showed little or no difference {{in their ability to}} produce RVF virus. We believe this tissue cell virus process to have potential application for large-scale production of vaccines for human or veterinary use or for the mass propagation of certain <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>viruses</b> for cancer research, once use of established lines for this purpose is accepted...|$|R
40|$|SEVERAL <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>viruses,</b> {{known to}} be {{responsible}} for spontaneous tumours in a given species, are able to induce a malignant transformation either in vitro or in vivo in the cells of an animal of another species. Yet their discovery has always been made by their inoculation into animals of the same species in which they had induced a so-called spontaneous tumour. This applies particularly to the Gross virus, the only virus whose role in spontaneous leukaemogenesis in mice is certain (Gross, 1961). It would seem that the greatest chance of revealing a leukaemogenic virus, in a material which only contains a small amount, would be by injecting animals of the same species as those in which it had appeared, rather than by injecting into other species. It is reasonable to think {{that there would be a}} greater chance of revealing a possible leukaemogenic virus in man if the biological material being studied were to be injected into human beings rather than into animals. These experiments in a direct form are not ethically acceptable, but an indirect approach could be used by injecting human material into animals with functioning human haemopoietic tissue-animal human chimeras. Furthermore, it must be remembered that the detection of viruses responsible for spontaneous tumours is often facilitated by using immuno-incompetent hosts, which are usually new-born animals. In haematopoietic chimeras there also exists an immune incompetence (Mathe, Amiel and Daguet, 1961), which is another reason for using this system. Before attempting to form haemopoietic chimeras between man and monkeys, we studied the possibility of detecting a known leukaemogenic virus in mice by inoculation of rat-mice haemopoietic chimeras. This was preceded by experiments in which the leukaemogenic viruse...|$|R
40|$|Genetic and {{environmental}} factors play an interactive {{role in the development}} of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Since the demonstration of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) influence on mouse leukemia in 1964, an HLA association has been considered as a possible genetic risk factor. Despite extensive efforts, however, no strong evidence comparable to the H- 2 (k) influence on mouse leukemia has been shown. The number of negative serological studies resulted in a loss of interest and consequently, no molecular HLA-DR association study has been published to date. We reconsidered the HLA-DR association in childhood ALL in 114 patients from a single center and 325 local newborn controls by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the HLA-DRB 1 / 3 / 4 / 5 loci. With conventional analysis, there was a moderate allelic association with the most common allele in the HLA-DR 53 group, HLA-DRB 1 * 04, in the whole group that was stronger in males (P =. 0005, odds ratio = 2. 9). When the other expressed HLA-DRB loci were examined, homozygosity for HLA-DRB 4 * 01, encoding the HLA-DR 53 specificity, was increased in patients (21. 1 % v 8. 3 %; odds ratio = 2. 9, P =. 0005). Consideration of gender showed that all of these associations were reflections of a male-specific increase in homozygosity for HLA-DRB 4 * 01 (32. 8 % v 4. 0 %; odds ratio = 11. 7, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 4. 9 to 28. 0; P = 3 x 10 (- 8)). This highly significant result provided the long-suspected evidence for the HLA-DR influence on the development of childhood ALL while confirming the recessive nature of the MHC influence on human leukemogenesis as in experimental models. The cross-reactivity between HLA-DR 53 and H- 2 Ek, extensive mimicry of the immunodominant epitope of HLA-DR 53 by several <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>viruses,</b> and the extra amount of DNA in the vicinity of the HLA-DRB 4 gene argue for the case that HLA-DRB 4 * 01 may be one of the genetic risk factors for childhood ALL...|$|R
40|$|Routine {{statistics}} of occupational mortality and incidence of cancer have consistently shown {{high rates of}} lung cancer in butchers. Possible explanations include infection by <b>carcinogenic</b> papilloma <b>viruses,</b> exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nitrites in the preservation of meat, or a confounding effect of tobacco. To explore these possibilities, we have examined the mortality of 1610 men employed at three British companies processing pork, beef, lamb, bacon, and other meat products. The overall death rate was less than in the national population (271 deaths observed, 310 expected) {{but there was an}} excess of deaths from cancer (87 observed, 80 expected), and in particular from lung cancer (42 observed, 32 expected). The risk of lung cancer was concentrated in subjects exposed to recently slaughtered meat, especially after an interval of 10 or more years. These findings increase suspicions of a risk of lung cancer in butchers, although further information is needed about smoking habits in the meat industry. If there is a hazard infection by a papilloma virus would seem the most likely cause...|$|R
40|$|<b>Carcinogenic</b> DNA <b>viruses</b> such as high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) and Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV) {{replicate}} during persistent infections as low-copy-number plasmids. EBV DNA replication {{is restricted}} by host cell replication licensing mechanisms. In contrast, copy number control of HPV genomes is not under cellular control but involves the viral sequence-specific DNA-binding E 2 activator and E 8 ∧E 2 C repressor proteins. Analysis of HPV 31 mutant genomes revealed that residues {{outside of the}} DNA-binding/dimerization domain of E 8 ∧E 2 C limit viral DNA replication, indicating that binding site competition or heterodimerization among E 2 and E 8 ∧E 2 C proteins does not contribute to copy number control. Domain swap experiments demonstrated that the amino-terminal 21 amino acids of E 8 ∧E 2 C represent a novel, transferable DNA replication repressor domain, whose activity requires conserved lysine and tryptophan residues. Furthermore, E 8 ∧E 2 C(1 - 21) -GAL 4 fusion proteins inhibited the replication of the plasmid origin of replication of EBV, suggesting that E 8 ∧E 2 C functions as a general replication repressor of extrachromosomal origins. This finding could be important {{for the development of}} novel therapies against persistent DNA tumor virus infections...|$|R
40|$|Papillomaviruses, small DNA viruses with a {{pronounced}} tro-pism for epithelial cells, have been isolated from many organ-isms. In humans, approximately 100 different virus types have been described, and this list {{is likely to}} grow. The human pap-illomaviruses (HPVs) {{are associated with a}} large spectrum of epithelial lesions. Most of these are benign hyperplasias (warts) that only very rarely progress to cancers. A subgroup of HPVs, i. e., the “high-risk ” HPVs, however, are associated with lesions that have a propensity to undergo carcinogenic progression. Most notably, almost all human cervical carcinomas contain and express high-risk HPV sequences.
