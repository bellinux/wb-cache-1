5|$|With {{extensive}} sand beaches, seabird breeding areas, {{and good}} dive {{sites in the}} Reef Observation Area {{to the south of}} the island, North Island is considered an attractive tourist site. However, all of the island's limited anchorage and jetty space is occupied by commercial fishers, so landings from private or charter boats are possible only by prior arrangement. Moreover, visitors are not permitted to camp on the island. North Island accounts for about 3.5% of private recreational boat trips to the Houtman Abrolhos and about 1% of <b>commercial</b> <b>charter</b> boat trips. The most recent tourism plan for the Houtman Abrolhos supports the continued use of North Island by private charter boats {{and the use of the}} airstrip for tourism purposes, but recommends against the establishment of a land-based tourist site there.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The paper {{seeks to}} examine whether or not wealth effects {{and changes in the}} {{systematic}} risk associated with the return structure of the Greek <b>commercial</b> <b>chartered</b> banks, investment firms and insurance companies resulted from the passage of the European Union Banking Directives over the period 1988 - 1997. Design/methodology/approach – Using monthly stock returns from the DataStream database for the period January 1988 to December 1997, the separate effects of each of the EU Banking Directives on Greek <b>commercial</b> <b>chartered</b> banks, investment firms and insurance companies are tested. The “seemingly unrelated regression” methodology is utilized to test three portfolios consisting of an equally weighted banking, investment and insurance index made up of major Greek banks, investment firms and insurance companies respectively. The Greek Market Index serves as a proxy for the market portfolio. All the aforementioned indices were converted to returns using the log difference method. Findings – Empirical results indicate that the systematic risk dramatically increased for Greek insurance and investment firms and moderately increased for Greek <b>commercial</b> <b>chartered</b> banks through the tabling of the Free Capital Movement Directive in the Greek Parliament. After controlling for systematic risk, the results suggest that the passage of the Free Capital Movement Directive did not create wealth effects for the shareholders of <b>commercial</b> <b>chartered</b> banks, investment firms and insurance companies. Conversely, the results demonstrate that the Second Banking, Investment Services and Capital Adequacy Directives produced no wealth effects for the investment firms and insurance companies, but not for <b>commercial</b> <b>chartered</b> banks' shareholders. The whole wealth effect on the Greek financial sector was neutral. Originality/value – This article will be of value to academics, bankers, bank regulators, practitioners, and economic policy makers who are interested in the regulatory evolution of the EU banking industry.

2500|$|The Lisbon {{merchant}} Fernão de Loronha held {{not only}} Fernando de Noronha island as a hereditary captaincy but also (from 1503 to around 1512) a commercial monopoly on trade in Brazil. Between 1503 and 1512, Noronha's agents {{set up a}} string of warehouses (feitorias) along the Brazilian coast, and engaged in trade with the indigenous peoples in Brazil for brazilwood, a native red dye wood highly valued by European clothmakers. [...] Fernando de Noronha island was the central collection point of this network. [...] Brazilwood, continuously harvested by the coastal Indians and delivered to the various coastal warehouses, was shipped to the central warehouse on Fernando de Noronha island, which was intermittently visited by a larger transport ship that would carry the collected loads back to Europe. After the expiration of Loronha's <b>commercial</b> <b>charter</b> in 1512, {{the organization of the}} brazilwood enterprise was taken over by the Portuguese crown, but Loronha and his descendents retained private ownership of Fernando de Noronha island itself as a hereditary captaincy, at least down to the 1560s.|$|E
