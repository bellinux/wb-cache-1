50|$|In {{addition}} to the previously mentioned navigational signals, the localizer provides for ILS facility identification by periodically transmitting a 1,020 Hz Morse <b>code</b> <b>identification</b> signal. For example, the ILS for runway 4R at John F. Kennedy International Airport transmits IJFK to identify itself, while runway 4L is known as IHIQ. This lets users know the facility is operating normally {{and that they are}} tuned to the correct ILS. The glide slope station transmits no identification signal, so ILS equipment relies on the localizer for identification.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to design a generalized architecture for polyphase <b>code</b> <b>identification</b> used in RADAR signal processing applications. The proposed VLSI architecture will identify the type of a given polyphase code, amount of phase change and number of phase changes. RADAR signal processing applications require a set of sequences with individually peaky autocorrelation and pair wise cross correlation. Obtaining such sequences is a combinatorial problem. This paper aims at implementation of an efficient VLSI system for the design of polyphase codes identification useful for RADAR applications. The VLSI system is implemented on the field programmable gate array as it provides the flexibility of reconfigurability and reprogrammability and it is a real time signal processing solution which identifies the polyphase codes. The simulation results and the FPGA implementation shows the successful <b>code</b> <b>identification,</b> amount of phase, number of phase changes for a given input sequence...|$|E

In random access process each user equipments (UE) transmits randomly selected random access code and the Node B detects each UE’s random access try by <b>code</b> <b>identification.</b> It is conducted by exploiting the cross-correlation property of random access code. Moreover, round trip time (RTT) is also estimated during random access detection process for uplink time synchronization utilizing the auto-correlation of random access code.

Current spectrum sensing is performed in two steps[7]: the first step called coarse spectrum sensing is to efficiently detect the power spectrum density (PSD) level of primary bands; the second step, called feature detection or multi-dimensional sensing[8], is to estimate other signal space accessible for CR, such as direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, spread spectrum <b>code</b> <b>identification,</b> waveform identification, etc.|$|E
