Also the bank has their own rules and regulations for clients addressing to the government policies. There are time limitation, shipment validity & expiry included with the export-import trade.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} ways {{of avoiding}} a liquidity trap and ways {{of getting out of}} one. Unless lower short nominal interest rates are associated with significantly lower interest volatility, a lower average rate of inflation, which will be associated with lower expected nominal interest rates, increases the odds that the zero nominal interest rate floor will become a binding constraint. The empirical evidence on this issue is mixed. Once in a liquidity trap, there are two means of escape. The first is to use expansionary fiscal policy. The second is to lower the zero nominal interest rate floor. This second option involves paying negative interest on government 'bearer bonds' [...] coin and currency, that is 'taxing money', as advocated by Gesell. This would also reduce the likelihood of ending up in a liquidity trap. Taxing currency amounts to having periodic 'currency reforms', that is, compulsory <b>conversions</b> <b>of</b> 'old' <b>currency</b> into 'new' currency, say by stamping <b>currency.</b> The terms <b>of</b> the <b>conversion</b> can be set to achieve any positive or negative interest rate on currency. There are likely to be significant shoe leather costs associated with such schemes. The policy question then becomes how much shoe leather it takes to fill an output gap? Finally the paper develops a simple analytical model showing how the economy can get into a liquidity trap and how Gesell money is one way of avoiding it or escaping from it. ...|$|R
40|$|Authorities {{have been}} {{managing}} the quoted interest rate since the 2008 / 2009 financial crisis. And for many, positive {{interest rates have}} not created much of a concern. Prior to 2008, a different world existed with positive interest rates. One characteristic of the interest rate - earned or paid - {{is the degree to}} which it may differ when quoted by a fiscal authority in a different region or country. For example, assuming all other factors are equal, if the interest rate earned on euros in France is three percent, and in Italy seven percent, an economist might conclude that the cost of living must be higher in Italy and the rate of inflation also higher, since interest rates quoted take into account the real rate of return plus a premium that reflects local inflation. A businessman, on the other hand, might assume that since higher rates in Italy are associated with higher risks, France would be a safer place to invest capital and conduct business. Such conclusions become more complicated if one country fixes the rate <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> its <b>currency</b> to another country. This is known as “pegging the currency”.

40|$|Ecological risk assessment, {{aiming at}} {{evaluating}} {{a wide range}} of undesirable consequences initiated by a possible eco-environmental hazard, has been the center of concern for ecosystem management in recent years. However, when it comes to disturbed natural ecosystems, most models developed for ecological risk assessment are restricted to instant cause-effect computation of single factors and often ignore the indirect effects, therefore fail to implement a holistic assessment at an ecosystem scale when interactions of different risk receptors are obvious. In this study, we developed a risk-based network model based on a new control analysis termed control allocation and a conceptual <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> flow <b>currency</b> in NEA. By taking a river ecosystem intercepted by dam construction as an example, risk propagation between all functional guilds of the ecosystem concerning both direct risk and integral risk dynamic were quantified and illustrated in the network model.

On the basis of the model results, we proposed the network-based indicators for assessing the system-wide risk condition and component-specific risk scenarios of disturbed ecosystems exposed to single or multiple stressors. This study could provide a novel perspective and methodology for assessing ecological risk at the system scale, and concurrently, serve as an elicitation of how we can effectively evaluate ecosystems on the same analytic basis of information-based networks...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{analyses}} of the transition to European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) have emphasized technical problems in the <b>conversion</b> ra-tios <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> into the euro {{at the start of}} Stage 111. Restrictions on bilateral conversion rates imply that they must be the same as market bilat-eral rates at the end of Stage 11. From this fact has come a conclusion that exchange markets may generate volatility, speculative attacks, or even indeterminacy of exchange rates {{on the last day of}} Stage 11. We show in this paper that concern over these technical issues per se, as an additional source of exchange market volatility, is a red herring: euro payment institu-tions that begin operating at the outset of Stage I 11 make it easy for “in” central banks to establish any desired bilateral conversion ratios for their currencies. As long as Stage I 11 itself is viable at the outset-a premise of the discussion-“in ” central banks are formidably armed to impose de-sired conversion ratios within the restrictions. All discussion of the conver-sion problem presumes that Stage I 11 will be viable. Otherwise, the notion that exchange rates are locked on 1 January 1999 is not valid. We also will presume that the irrevocable fixed rates will not be revoked on 1 January 1999 (or more accurately by the time the payments systems close on 4 January, the first business day of the year) and that the institutions will work as designed at the start of Stage 111. Moreover, the exchange rate models of monetary policy used to derive implications of increased volatility are quite narrow.
