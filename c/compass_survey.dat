50|$|While <b>compass</b> <b>surveying,</b> the {{magnetic}} needle is sometimes disturbed from its normal position {{under the influence}} of external attractive forces. Such a disturbing influence is called as local attraction. The external forces are produced by sources of local attraction which may be current carrying wire (magnetic materials) or metal objects. The term is also used to denote amount of deviation of the needle from its normal position.

40|$|In {{tropical}} forest systems, attine ants are the dominant herbivores. They construct large nest structures that include foraging trails that extend to multiple plant sources throughout the forest. These foraging areas vary from nest to nest {{and they are}} highly dynamic over time and season changes. It was expected that characteristics of both the nest structure and the surrounding environment would affect the size of nest foraging areas. In this study, <b>COMPASS</b> <b>survey</b> software and ArcGIS were used to map the foraging trails and calculate the foraging areas of 12 attine ant nests located on the Firestone Reserve, {{over the course of}} 6 weeks. Data collected at the ant nest sites on nest area, flow rate, trail number and neighboring nest proximity were combined with data collected from previous studies on soil pH and light fractions in order to test correlation hypotheses between these factors and foraging area.

40|$|Abstract Objective: This study {{characterized}} {{overweight and}} obesity among {{a sample of}} Canadian off-reserve Aboriginal (ORA) students in grades 9 to 12, identified between-school variability in overweight and obesity, and identified student-level characteristics associated with the weight status outcomes. Methods: This cross-sectional study used student data collected from 29, 433 students in grades 9 to 12 from 43 secondary schools {{as part of the}} 2012 - 2013 <b>COMPASS</b> <b>Survey.</b> Logistic regression analyses examined the association between student-level characteristics with overweight and obesity. Results: Among this sample of Canadian students in grades 9 to 12, 14. 0 % and 9. 2 % of ORA were overweight and obese respectively, while 13. 7 % and 6. 0 % of non-Aboriginal youth were overweight and obese respectively. While 56. 9 % of non-Aboriginal youth were normal weight, only 47. 1 % of ORA youth were normal weight. Between-school random variation in the odds an ORA student is overweight and obese was identified; school-level differences only accounted for 0. 1 % of the variability in overweight and 1. 0 % of the variability in obesity among ORA. Male ORA students were more likely than female ORA students to be obese (OR 2. 39, 95 % CI 1. 28 - 4. 45). Among ORA, for every one unit increase in kilocalories per kilogram (KKD), the odds of being obese (versus normal weight) decreased. Conclusions: Promoting healthy weight among Canadian ORA students is a public health priority, as a substantial number of ORA students are overweight or obese. Additionally, the data illustrates significant differences in the rate of overweight and obesity between ORA and non-Aboriginal students. Considering that KKD was associated with obesity among ORA youth, this helps to further support the notion that increasing physical activity levels among young populations may be a valuable obesity prevention and control strategy. Rather than providing overall youth estimates that may lead to misinformed inferences, future surveillance that report direct comparisons between ORA and non-Aboriginal populations are valuable. These findings underscore the need for culturally appropriate policies and interventions that address the distinct needs of this at-risk population...|$|E
40|$|Astronomical {{analysis}} of 10 th to 12 th century A. D. cultural evidence at Chaco Canyon New Mexico {{began in the}} 1970 s. Published work includes a variety of proposals including horizon calendars, solar calendrical constructs in architecture, cardinal North-South and/or East-West (NS/EW) alignments of architecture and roads, building alignments to lunar standstills or June solstice sunrise, wall alignments to equinox sunrise or sunset, and the positioning of structures at observation points for horizon calendrical stations. Within the published archaeoastronomy work attention to Pueblo ethnography, archaeological evidence including temporal data, statistical significance, and the consideration of multiple hypotheses has varied widely. The sample of Chacoan Great Houses assessed for astronomical associations was unchanged from the mid 1990 s to 2007. There is active debate among archaeologists regarding {{the relative importance of}} political, ritual, and economic factors in the Chacoan regional system. Past archaeoastronomy work has had limited influence on such debate. Nonetheless, there is general acceptance among archaeologists of the idea that visual astronomy had a role in Chacoan culture, {{if for no other reason}} than to provide a calendrical system. This research expands on previous samples of Chacoan Great Houses to include all those identified within "downtown Chaco," as well as a small sample of "halo" and "outlier" Great Houses. The field work, conducted under National Park Service and Bureau of Land Management permits, included <b>compass</b> <b>survey,</b> theodolite survey, and photography at a total of 28 sites. Survey results were assessed in the context of positional astronomy, Pueblo ethnography, and the archaeological record including published construction dates for the sites. I found no convincing evidence for previously proposed architectural alignments to lunar standstills, June solstice sunrises, or equinox events. I have found that a majority of the studied Chacoan structures to conform to one or more of four architectural traditions that have astronomical associations. These include front-facing south-southeast (SSE) orientation, front facing east-southeast (ESE) orientation, alignments to the cardinal directions of North-South and/or East-West (NS/EW), and the construction of Great Houses at workable calendrical stations with horizon foresights for solstice dates. Multiple Great Houses exhibit two of these traditions in combination. A single case is identified that may incorporate three of the traditions. The "halo" Great House at Bis sa'ani includes a cardinal North-South and East-West ("NS/EW") structure, a possible SSE-facing room block, and a June solstice sunrise horizon foresight. Building upon Hayes' and Lekson's assessments of orientations, temporal {{analysis of}} these four traditions may improve our understanding of shifting patterns of multi-cultural collaboration and dominance among ancestral Pueblo groups. A majority of the Great Houses built before A. D. 1000 are front-facing to the SSE. The SSE orientation tradition continued during the peak of Bonito Phase construction activity (A. D. 1020 - 1100). Most of the putative lunar standstill and June solstice sunrise alignments comprise a subset of this SSE facing group. During the same period, the first cardinal NS and EW architectural alignments were also completed. Four ESE facing Great Houses were constructed within and in proximity to Chaco between A. D. 860 and A. D. 1090. This third orientation tradition may represent some form of cultural affiliation with contemporary Rio Grande Valley people based upon comparison to previous orientation studies conducted by Lakatos, or it may perhaps represent an alternative cosmological intent. The "new" Great Houses built during the Late Bonito phase at Chaco after A. D. 1100 are all either involved in inter-site cardinal NS alignments, or positioned at or in proximity to observing locations that can function as solstice calendrical stations. Workable solstice horizon calendars are now confirmed at Casa Chiquita, Kin Kletso, Headquarters Site A, Wijiji, Bis sa'ani, and 125 m from Roberts Small Pueblo at 29 SJ 2538 / 2539. A potential calendrical station located in the vicinity of Peñasco Blanco's McElmo ruin is yet to be confirmed. The Late Bonito "calendrical" Great Houses may have been intended as pilgrimage destinations where people could witness a dramatic solstice sunrise or sunset. During the same time period, SSE orientation was dominant in the Totah region to the north at sites including Aztec and Chimney Rock. The astronomical evidence presented supports the idea that people with at least three distinct cosmological intents collaborated at Chaco; it also supports Van Dyke's hypothesis that Late Bonito phase construction at Chaco represented an attempt by a weakened ritual elite to reinvigorate their legitimacy and power. The consistency of cosmological and solstitial references among Late Bonito Phase Great Houses at Chaco indicates that the Late Bonito Chacoan elite's power may have rested in part on esoteric astronomical knowledge, and an elevated cultural status for solar events.

50|$|A {{prismatic}} compass is a navigation and surveying instrument which is extensively {{used to find}} out the bearing of the traversing and included angles between them, waypoints (an endpoint of the lcourse) and direction. <b>Compass</b> <b>surveying</b> is a type of surveying in which the directions of surveying lines are determined with a magnetic compass, and the length of the surveying lines are measured with a tape or chain or laser range finder. The compass is generally used to run a traverse line. The compass calculates bearings of lines with respect to magnetic north. The included angles can then be calculated using suitable formulas in case of clockwise and anti-clockwise traverse respectively. For each survey line in the traverse, surveyors take two bearings that is fore bearing and back bearing which should exactly differ by 180° if local attraction is negligible. The name Prismatic compass is given to it because it essentially consists of a prism which is used for taking observations more accurately.|$|R
