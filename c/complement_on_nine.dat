40|$|In {{the present}} work we studied the {{expression}} of membrane-bound Ig (MBIg) as well as receptors for IgG Fc and <b>complement</b> <b>on</b> <b>nine</b> human lymphoblastoid cell lines. When MBIg and receptors for IgG Fc were compared, four categories of cell lines could be distinguished: (a) cell lines having both MBIg and receptors for IgG Fc, (b) cell lines having MBIg but lacking receptors for IgG Fc, (c) cell lines lacking MBIg but having receptors for IgG Fc, and (d) cell lines lacking both MBIg and receptors for IgG Fc. Two types of receptors for complement could be detected on the cell lines studied, one for C 3 -C 3 b and one for C 3 d. When sensitized red cells carrying C 3 b or C 3 d were used for rosette tests, three categories of cell lines could be distinguished: (a) cell lines having receptors for C 3 b and C 3 d, (b) cell lines having receptors only for C 3 d and (c) cell lines lacking both receptors. However, when a more sensitive immunofluorescent method was used instead of the rosette technique, {{it was found that}} cell lines unable to form rosettes with EAC 1423 bhu were able to bind soluble C 3 or C 3 b which indicated the presence of these receptors on the cell surface. Inhibition experiments showed that receptors for C 3 -C 3 b and receptors for C 3 d are distinct and that receptors for C 3 -C 3 b and C 3 d are different from receptors for IgG Fc. A cell line (Raji) without MBIg but with receptors for IgG Fc, C 3 -C 3 b, and C 3 d was selected for use in studying the binding mechanism of soluble immune complexes to cell surface membrane. Aggregated human gamma globulin was used in place of immune complexes. Immune complexes containing complement bind to Raji cells only via receptors for complement, namely receptors for C 3 -C 3 b and C 3 d. Binding of immune complexes containing complement to cells is much greater than that of complexes without complement. Immune complexes bound to cells via receptors for complement can be partially released from the cell surface by addition of normal human serum as well as isolated human C 3 or C 3 b. We postulate that such release is due to competition of immune complex bound C 3 b and free C 3 or C 3 b for the receptors on Raji cells...|$|E
