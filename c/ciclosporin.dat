5|$|SLCO1B3 {{has been}} {{identified}} as the human hepatic uptake transporter for amatoxins; moreover, substrates and inhibitors of that protein—among others rifampicin, penicillin, silibinin, antamanide, paclitaxel, <b>ciclosporin</b> and prednisolone—may be useful for the treatment of human amatoxin poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Doctors will {{sometimes}} prescribe immunosuppressive {{drugs such as}} prednisolone and <b>ciclosporin</b> if the patient is suffering from an intense form of solar urticaria. However, {{the side effects of}} these medicines can be severe which is why they are reserved for the most extreme of cases.|$|E
5|$|Diuretics {{have been}} {{associated}} with attacks of gout. However, a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except losartan), beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs <b>ciclosporin</b> and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
5|$|Many species produce {{metabolites}} {{that are}} {{major sources of}} pharmacologically active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the penicillins, a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as penicillin G (produced by Penicillium chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, {{a wide range of}} other penicillins can be produced by chemical modification of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: <b>ciclosporin,</b> commonly used as an immunosuppressant during transplant surgery; and fusidic acid, used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the rhizosphere, and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include griseofulvin isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum, used to treat fungal infections, and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include mevastatin from Penicillium citrinum and lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and the oyster mushroom.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ciclosporin,</b> may {{increase}} plasma levels of <b>ciclosporin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Ciclosporin</b> {{is highly}} metabolized in {{humans and animals}} after ingestion. The {{resulting}} metabolites include cyclosporin B, C, D, E, H, L, and others. <b>Ciclosporin</b> metabolites {{have been found to}} have lower immunosuppressant activity than CsA (approximately <10%), and are associated with higher nephrotoxicity. Individual <b>ciclosporin</b> metabolites have been isolated and characterized but {{do not appear to be}} extensively studied.|$|E
25|$|Use of <b>ciclosporin</b> in post renal {{transplantation}} {{is associated}} with hyperuricemia and, in some cases, gout. This {{is due to the}} decrease in glomerular filtration rate induced by <b>ciclosporin</b> leading to retention of uric acid. Use of azathioprine as an alternative has shown to reduce the incidence of gouty arthritis.|$|E
25|$|The drug {{exhibits}} {{very poor}} solubility in water, and, as a consequence, suspension and emulsion {{forms of the}} drug {{have been developed for}} oral administration and for injection. <b>Ciclosporin</b> was originally brought to market by Sandoz, now Novartis, under the brand name Sandimmune, which is available as soft gelatin capsules, as an oral solution, and as a formulation for intravenous administration. These are all nonaqueous compositions. A newer microemulsion, orally-administered formulation, Neoral, is available as a solution and as soft gelatin capsules (10mg, 25mg, 50mg and 100mg). The Neoral compositions are designed to form microemulsions in contact with water. Generic <b>ciclosporin</b> preparations have been marketed under various trade names, including Cicloral (Sandoz/Hexal), Gengraf (Abbott) and Deximune (Dexcel Pharma). Since 2002, a topical emulsion of <b>ciclosporin</b> for treating inflammation caused by keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome) has been marketed under the trade name Restasis (0.05%). Inhaled <b>ciclosporin</b> formulations are in clinical development, and include a solution in propylene glycol and liposome dispersions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ciclosporin</b> {{has been}} used {{experimentally}} to treat cardiac hypertrophy (an increase in cell volume).|$|E
25|$|<b>Ciclosporin</b> binds to the cytosolic protein cyclophilin (immunophilin) of lymphocytes, {{especially}} T cells. This {{complex of}} <b>ciclosporin</b> and cyclophilin inhibits calcineurin, which, under normal circumstances, {{is responsible for}} activating the transcription of interleukin 2. In T-cells, activation of the T-cell receptor normally increases intracellular calcium, which acts via calmodulin to activate calcineurin. Calcineurin then dephosphorylates the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFATc), which moves to {{the nucleus of the}} T-cell and increases the activity of genes coding for IL-2 and related cytokines. <b>Ciclosporin</b> prevents the dephosphorylation of NF-AT by binding to cyclophilin. It also inhibits lymphokine production and interleukin release and, therefore, leads to a reduced function of effector T-cells. It does not affect cytostatic activity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ciclosporin</b> is the INN and British Approved Name (BAN) while {{cyclosporine}} is the United States Adopted Name (USAN) and cyclosporin is {{a former}} BAN.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ciclosporin</b> binds to the cyclophilin D protein (CypD) that {{constitutes}} {{part of the}} mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), and by inhibiting the calcineurin phosphatase pathway.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the {{metabolism}} of zonisamide is inhibited by ketoconazole, <b>ciclosporin,</b> miconazole, fluconazole and carbamazepine (in {{descending order}} of inhibition) {{due to their}} effects on the CYP3A4 enzyme.|$|E
25|$|There is 'B' level {{evidence}} ('good scientific evidence') {{for increased}} dietary ω-3 in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and protection from <b>ciclosporin</b> toxicity in organ transplant patients.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ciclosporin</b> is {{currently}} in a phase II/III (adaptive) clinical study in Europe to determine its ability to ameliorate neuronal cellular damage and reperfusion injury (phase III) in traumatic brain injury. This multi-center study is being organized by NeuroVive Pharma and the European Brain Injury Consortium using NeuroVive's formulation of <b>ciclosporin</b> called NeuroSTAT (also known by its cardioprotection trade name of CicloMulsion). This formulation uses a lipid emulsion base instead of cremophor and ethanol. NeuroSTAT was recently compared to Sandimmune in a phase I study and found to be bioequivalent. In this study, NeuroSTAT did not exhibit the anaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions found in cremophor- and ethanol-based products.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} prevent {{transplant}} rejection and subsequent damage to the new lung or lungs, patients must take a regimen of immunosuppressive drugs. Patients will normally {{have to take a}} combination of these medicines in order to combat the risk of rejection. This is a lifelong commitment, and must be strictly adhered to. The immunosuppressive regimen is begun just before or after surgery. Usually the regimen includes <b>ciclosporin,</b> azathioprine and corticosteroids, but as episodes of rejection may reoccur throughout a patient's life, the exact choices and dosages of immunosuppressants may have to be modified over time. Sometimes tacrolimus is given instead of <b>ciclosporin</b> and mycophenolate mofetil instead of azathioprine.|$|E
25|$|When eczema is {{severe and}} does not respond {{to other forms of}} treatment, {{systemic}} immunosuppressants are sometimes used. Immunosuppressants can cause significant side effects and some require regular blood tests. The most commonly used are <b>ciclosporin,</b> azathioprine, and methotrexate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ciclosporin</b> is {{believed}} to work by decreasing the function of lymphocytes. It does this by forming a complex with cyclophilin to block the phosphatase activity of calcineurin that in turn decreases the production of inflammatory cytokines by T‐lymphocytes.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these indications, <b>ciclosporin</b> is also used in severe atopic dermatitis, Kimura disease, pyoderma gangrenosum, chronic autoimmune urticaria, acute systemic mastocytosis, and, infrequently, in rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases, although it is only used in severe cases.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} other {{conditions}} can also increase cholesterol levels including diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity, alcohol use, monoclonal gammopathy, dialysis, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome, anorexia nervosa, medications (e.g., thiazide diuretics, <b>ciclosporin,</b> glucocorticoids, beta blockers, retinoic acid, antipsychotics).|$|E
25|$|Other {{side effects}} of {{medications}} including gastrointestinal inflammation and ulceration of the stomach and esophagus, hirsutism (excessive hair growth in a male-pattern distribution) with <b>ciclosporin,</b> hair loss with tacrolimus, obesity, acne, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypercholesterolemia, and osteoporosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ciclosporin</b> {{has also}} been used to help treat people with acute severe {{ulcerative}} colitis and autoimmune urticaria that {{do not respond to}} treatment with steroids. This drug is also used as a treatment of posterior or intermediate uveitis with noninfective cause.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ciclosporin</b> {{has been}} {{investigated}} as a possible neuroprotective agent in conditions such as traumatic brain injury, and {{has been shown in}} animal experiments to reduce brain damage associated with injury. <b>Ciclosporin</b> blocks the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which has been found to cause much of the damage associated with head injury and neurodegenerative diseases. Ciclosporin's neuroprotective properties were first discovered in the early 1990s when two researchers (Eskil Elmér and Hiroyuki Uchino) were conducting experiments in cell transplantation. An unintended finding was that CsA was strongly neuroprotective when it crossed the blood–brain barrier. This same process of mitochondrial destruction through the opening of the MPT pore is implicated in making traumatic brain injuries much worse.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ciclosporin</b> affects {{mitochondria}} {{by preventing}} the mitochondrial permeability transition pore from opening, thus inhibiting cytochrome c release, a potent apoptotic stimulation factor. This {{is not the}} primary mechanism of action for clinical use, but {{is also an important}} effect for research on apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ciclosporin</b> is an {{immunosuppressive}} agent {{most often used}} in organ transplantation that has demonstrated to be effective with skin disorders. It functions by lessening production of autoantibodies and therefore diminishing the development of blisters and erosions. The mechanism of action is by inhibiting the production of T lymphocytes and lymphokines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ciclosporin,</b> also spelled {{cyclosporine}} and cyclosporin, is an immunosuppressant {{medication and}} natural product. It {{is used by}} mouth and injection into a vein for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, nephrotic syndrome, and in organ transplants to prevent rejection. It is also used as eye drops for keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes).|$|E
25|$|Stähelin {{had used}} a similar screen to {{discover}} the nonmyelotoxic immunosuppressant ovalicin. Applying the revised screen led {{to the discovery of}} the potent biological activity of <b>ciclosporin</b> on January 31, 1972. This drug was to revolutionize organ transplantation in the 1970s and the paper became a citation classic (CC/6:16-16, February 6, 1984).|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{similarly}} named tacrolimus, sirolimus {{is not a}} calcineurin inhibitor, but it has {{a similar}} suppressive effect on the immune system. Sirolimus inhibits IL-2 and other cytokines receptor-dependent signal transduction mechanisms, via action on mTOR, and thereby blocks activation of T and B cells. <b>Ciclosporin</b> and tacrolimus inhibit the secretion of IL-2, by inhibiting calcineurin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ciclosporin</b> has now {{replaced}} {{some of the}} azathioprine use due to {{a longer}} survival time, especially in heart-related transplantations. Moreover, despite being considerably more expensive, mycophenolate mofetil is also increasingly being used in place of azathioprine in organ transplantation, as it is associated with less bone marrow suppression, fewer opportunistic infections, and a lower incidence of acute rejection.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ciclosporin</b> is {{approved}} by the FDA to prevent and treat graft-versus-host disease in bone-marrow transplantation and to prevent rejection of kidney, heart, and liver transplants. It is also approved in the US {{for the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, as an ophthalmic emulsion for the treatment of dry eyes (a common symptom of Sjögren's syndrome), and as a treatment for persistent nummular keratitis following adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ciclosporin</b> was {{isolated}} in 1971 from the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum and came into medical use in 1983. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 106.50 a month. In the United Kingdom it costs the NHS about 121.25 per month. The wholesale price in the United States is about 172.95 per month.|$|E
25|$|If {{complications}} {{cannot be}} controlled {{or when the}} liver ceases functioning, liver transplantation is necessary. Survival from liver transplantation has been improving over the 1990s, and the five-year survival rate is now around 80%. The survival rate depends largely on the severity of disease and other medical risk factors in the recipient. In the United States, the MELD score is used to prioritize patients for transplantation. Transplantation necessitates the use of immune suppressants (<b>ciclosporin</b> or tacrolimus).|$|E
25|$|There {{are ways}} in which {{autoimmunity}} caused by molecular mimicry can be avoided. Control of the initiating factor (pathogen) via vaccination {{seems to be the}} most common method to avoid autoimmunity. Inducing tolerance to the host autoantigen in this way may also be the most stable factor. The development of a downregulating immune response to the shared epitope between pathogen and host may be the best way of treating an autoimmune disease caused by molecular mimicry. Alternatively, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs such as <b>ciclosporin</b> and azathioprine has also been used as a possible solution. However, in many cases this {{has been shown to be}} ineffective because cells and tissues have already been destroyed at the onset of the infection.|$|E
25|$|ADRs {{can include}} {{enlargement}} of the gums, convulsions, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, hypercholesterolemia, dyspnea, numbness and tingling particularly of the lips, pruritus, high blood pressure, potassium retention possibly leading to hyperkalemia, kidney and liver dysfunction (nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity), burning sensations at finger tips, and an increased vulnerability to opportunistic fungal and viral infections. In short, it is nephrotoxic, neurotoxic, {{increases the risk of}} squamous cell carcinoma and infections, and often causes hypertension (due to renal vasoconstriction and increased sodium reabsorption). The latter may result in serious adverse cardiovascular events; thus it is recommended that prescribers find the lowest effective dose for people requiring long term treatment. <b>Ciclosporin</b> also causes {{enlargement of the}} gums and increased hair growth which is not seen with tacrolimus (another calcineurin inhibitor).|$|E
25|$|Given its rarity, {{the optimal}} {{treatment}} for acute optic neuropathy in Behçet's disease {{has not been}} established. Early identification and treatment is essential. Response to <b>ciclosporin,</b> periocular triamcinolone, and IV methylprednisone followed by oral prednisone has been reported although relapses leading to irreversible visual loss may occur even with treatment. Immunosuppressants such as interferon alpha and tumour necrosis factor antagonists may improve though not completely reverse symptoms of ocular Behçet's disease, which may progress over time despite treatment. When symptoms are limited to the anterior chamber of the eye prognosis is improved. Posterior involvement, particularly optic nerve involvement, is a poor prognostic indicator. Secondary optic nerve atrophy is frequently irreversible. Lumbar puncture or surgical treatment {{may be required to}} prevent optic atrophy in cases of intracranial hypertension refractory to treatment with immunomodulators and steroids.|$|E
25|$|Penicillins may {{decrease}} {{the elimination of}} methotrexate, so {{increase the risk of}} toxicity. While they may be used together, increased monitoring is recommended. The aminoglycosides, neomycin and paromomycin, have been found to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of methotrexate. Probenecid inhibits methotrexate excretion, which increases the risk of methotrexate toxicity. Likewise, retinoids and trimethoprim have been known to interact with methotrexate to produce additive hepatotoxicity and haematotoxicity, respectively. Other immunosuppressants like <b>ciclosporin</b> may potentiate methotrexate's haematologic effects, hence potentially leading to toxicity. NSAIDs have also been found to fatally interact with methotrexate in numerous case reports. Nitrous oxide potentiating the haematological toxicity of methotrexate has also been documented. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and the anticonvulsant valproate have been found to increase the plasma concentrations of methotrexate, as have nephrotoxic agents such as cisplatin, the GI drug colestyramine, and dantrolene.|$|E
