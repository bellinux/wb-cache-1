5000|$|Due to the {{abrasive}} {{effect of}} the creping blade {{the surface of the}} yankee becomes irregular and rough. Therefore periodically (with very varying frequency: from every 6 months to some years)cast iron yankees have to be ground or polished. This decreases the thickness of the shell, and since the yankee is a pressure vessel, also the maximum pressure which can be used for paper production. A way to avoid this declassing of pressure is to make a metallisation, i.e. to spray onto the surface a special Chrom-Nickel alloy, similar to a high allyed stainless steel, which is then ground with the foreseen crown of the shell surface, leaving a coated thickness of ca. 0,7-1 mm. The metallised surface is then much more resistant to the abrasion and only a very mild polishing may be necessary ca. every 2 to 4 years.The thermal conductivity of the metallisation is a bit less than that of the original material, so that cast iron cylinders are metallised after some grindings of the shell, in order to gain thorugh thickness decrease some conductivity which is then again lost with the metallisation. Steel yankees are instead always metallised since the beginning. The big dimension generates a problem with the elimination of the condensate forming inside the cylinders, therefore all yankees use a system with blow through steam which than it is re-compressed by help of a thermocompressor (ejector). In the inner surface of the yankee circular grooves are present which accommodate small pipes (s.c. [...] "straw pipes" [...] or [...] "straws") through which the mixture of steam and condensate is sucked ba means of a pressure difference between the yankee and the tank collecting the <b>condensate</b> (<b>separator).</b> The straws are combined in racks and these go to typically 6 collectors which take the condensate-steam mixture towards the center of the cylinder from which then it is taken out into usual piping and brought to the separator. Here the condensate and the blow through steam separate at a lower pressure than that inside the yankee.In order not to spoil the blow through steam, a thermocompressor uses motive steam (at a pressure ca. the double of that in the yankee) in order to increase again the pressure of the blow through steam to the value of the yankee.|$|E
40|$|A {{synthetic}} rubber powder {{was used to}} adsorb the residual oil in palm oil mill effluent (POME). POME is the wastewater produced by the palm oil industry. It is a colloidal suspension which is 95 - 96 % water, 0. 6 - 0. 7 % oil and 4 - 5 % total solids including 2 - 4 % suspended solids originating in the mixing of sterilizer <b>condensate,</b> <b>separator</b> sludge and hydrocyclone wastewater. POME contains 4, 000 mg dm- 3 of oil and grease, which is relatively high compared to the limit of only 50 mg dm- 3 set by the Malaysian Department of Environment. A bench-scale study of the adsorption of residual oil in POME using {{synthetic rubber}} powder was conducted using a jar test apparatus. The adsorption process was studied by varying parameters affecting the process. The parameters were adsorbent dosage, mixing speed, mixing time and pH. The optimum values of the parameters were obtained. It was found that almost 88 % removal of residual oil was obtained with an adsorbent dosage of 30 mg dm- 3 and mixing speed of 150 rpm for 3 hr at a pH 7. Adsorption equilibrium was also studied, and {{it was found that}} the adsorption process on the synthetic rubber powder fit the Freundlich isotherm model...|$|E
40|$|The {{complex of}} the {{mathematical}} models and methods for designs of the thermogasodynamic and heat-mass-transferring {{design in the}} multicomponent jet flows has been developed. A number of the earlier-unknown effects and phenomena in these flows and processes has been determined. The technological designs of the processes (jet-displaced gas compression, separation of liquid from gas at slug flow condition, inertion-shock separation of drop liquid from gas) have been proposed firstly; the design principles of the high-effective equipment (one-nozzle and multi-nozzle ejectors, pulsated and eddy thermotransformers) with multicomponent jet flows have been developed. The pump-ejector plant, series of the inertion-shock action separetors and oil <b>condensate</b> <b>separators</b> have been introduced.

25|$|The turbine {{consists}} of one high-pressure rotor and four low-pressure ones. Five low-pressure separators-preheaters {{are used to}} heat steam with fresh steam before being fed to {{the next stage of}} the turbine. The uncondensed steam is fed into a condenser, mixed with <b>condensate</b> from the <b>separators,</b> fed by the first-stage condensate pump to a chemical purifier, then by a second-stage condensate pump to four deaerators where dissolved and entrained gases are removed; deaerators also serve as storage tanks for feedwater. From the deaerators, the water is pumped through filters and into the bottom parts of the steam separator drums.|$|R
