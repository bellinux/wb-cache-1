5|$|Books are {{sometimes}} attacked by cockroaches, silverfish, book mites, booklice, and various beetles which {{feed on the}} covers, paper, bindings and glue. They leave behind physical damage {{in the form of}} tiny holes as well as staining from their faeces. Book pests include the larder beetle, and the larvae of the black <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> and the drugstore beetle which attack leather-bound books, while the common clothes moth and the brown house moth attack cloth bindings. These attacks are largely a problem with historic books, because modern bookbinding materials are less susceptible to this type of damage.|$|E
5|$|The head, having {{mouthparts}} projecting {{forward or}} sometimes downturned, is usually heavily sclerotized and is sometimes very large. The eyes are compound and may display remarkable adaptability, {{as in the}} case of the aquatic whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae), where they are split to allow a view both above and below the waterline. Longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) and weevils have divided eyes, while many have eyes that are notched, and a few have ocelli, small, simple eyes usually farther back on the head (on the vertex); these are more common in larvae than in adults. Ocelli are found in the adult <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> (Dermestidae), some rove beetles (Omaliinae), and the Derodontidae.|$|E
25|$|Some {{imidazole}} derivatives show {{effects on}} insects, for example sulconazole nitrate exhibits a strong anti-feeding {{effect on the}} keratin-digesting Australian <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae Anthrenocerus australis, as does econazole nitrate with the common clothes moth Tineola bisselliella.|$|E

50|$|This beetle is 2 to 3.5 {{millimeters}} {{long and}} round in shape. It is black with variable patterns {{of white and}} yellow mottling. The legs are covered in yellow scales. It looks similar to other <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles,</b> but its tiny body scales are rounded or oval, while those of other <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> are longer and narrower. Each antenna is tipped with a club.|$|R
40|$|The common fabric {{destroying}} {{insects in}} Nebraska are clothes moths, <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles,</b> and silverfish. Clothes moths and <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> feed on and digest wool, leather, cotton, silk, and synthetic fibers. They generally infest clothes, carpets, rugs, upholstery, etc. Silverfish feed principally on paper products, glue, paste, wallpaper, starch, and any food products consumed by humans. They also damage clothing, cotton, linen, rayon and ramie fabrics. This extension circular explains these insects {{and the proper}} ways of eliminating them in your household...|$|R
2500|$|Pseudoscorpions are {{generally}} beneficial to humans since they prey on clothes moth larvae, <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae, booklice, ants, mites, and small flies. They {{are small and}} inoffensive, and are rarely seen due to their size. They usually enter the home by [...] "riding along" [...] with larger insects (known as phoresy), or are brought in with firewood. They are often observed in bathrooms or laundry rooms, since they seek humidity. They may sometimes be found feeding on mites under the wing covers of certain beetles.|$|E
50|$|Anthrenus sarnicus, the Guernsey <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle,</b> {{is a type}} of <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle.</b> It can be {{generally}} found in Great Britain. Its suborder is Polyphaga, the infraorder is Bostrichiformia, the superfamily is Bostrichoidea, and the family is Dermestidae.

50|$|Pests {{are another}} {{significant}} threat to textile collections, {{as there are}} a number of creatures which can cause damage to fibres. Among the most common are clothes moths, <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles,</b> silverfish, firebrats and rodents.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae {{start to}} feed {{as soon as}} they hatch. They are carrot shaped and heavily covered with setae, {{especially}} on their posterior end. The number of instars differ from 5-11 and in some cases reach up to 20. Larvae of the black <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> Attagenus megatoma may grow up to 1/2 inch (12 mm) and be yellow to brown in color. Other types of <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> are regularly 1/4 to 1 inch (6 to 25 mm) long and covered with dark setae. Certain species have distinctive tufts of setae extending from their posterior end. These beetles are attracted to soiled fabrics and crevices where dead insects may serve as a food source. The larvae of the <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> are often referred to as [...] "woolly bears" [...] or [...] "buffalo moths".|$|E

50|$|Mildew, perspiration, and bleach {{can also}} damage the fabric, {{but it is}} {{resistant}} to moths and <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles.</b> Linen {{is relatively easy to}} take care of, since it resists dirt and stains, has no lint or pilling tendency, and can be dry-cleaned, machine-washed or steamed. It can withstand high temperatures, and has only moderate initial shrinkage.|$|R
50|$|Signs {{that you}} have an {{infestation}} is spotting their pellets and skin. You should also expect to see the adult beetles and their larvae. Adult guernsey <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> have patches of brown, white, and black. They move slowly and if you touch them they will roll over. Identify the source of the infestations by looking where there is more beetles, skins, and feces.|$|R
50|$|Household fibers, such as {{wool and}} silk, are {{especially}} prone to moth damage and special cleaning, which includes moth proofing, {{needs to be}} done frequently. Application of insecticides must be by spot treatment to crack and crevice sites where they are suspected of hiding. Pyrethrins are labeled for use against hide beetles. Insecticides used for <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> are also appropriate to use against hide and larder beetles.|$|R

40|$|Dermestid beetles are in {{the family}} Dermestidae and order Coleoptera. These beetles are {{sometimes}} called larder <b>beetles</b> or <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles.</b> Adults range from 1 to 12 mm in length and have variable body coloration. In general, they are hairy, dark-colored, elongated, and have clubbed antennae. The larvae are light brown and can be up to 13 mm long. Many larvae have spines, called setae, {{on the back of}} the abdomen that are helpful with identification. Dermestid larvae and adults have chewing mouthparts...|$|R
50|$|Dermestidae are {{a family}} of Coleoptera that are {{commonly}} referred to as skin beetles. Other common names include larder beetle, hide or leather <b>beetles,</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles,</b> and khapra beetles. There are approximately 500 to 700 species worldwide. They can range in size from 1 to 12 mm. Key characteristics for adults are round oval shaped bodies covered in scales or setae. The (usually) clubbed antennae fit into deep grooves. The hind femora also fit into recesses of the coxa. Larvae are scarabaeiform and also have setae.|$|R

50|$|Anthrenus (Anthrenus) scrophulariae, {{also known}} as the common <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle,</b> is a species of beetle found in Europe, the Middle East and the Nearctic. In Europe, it is found in almost every country. The beetle may {{frequently}} be found on Euphorbia cyparissias.|$|E
5000|$|Anthrenocerus australis is {{a species}} of beetle in the family Dermestidae, the skin beetles. It is known {{commonly}} as the Australian <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle.</b> It is native to Australia, New Guinea, and New Zealand, and it is present in Europe as an introduced species.|$|E
5000|$|Integrated pest {{management}} (IPM) is a specialized modern pest control used in museums. All IPM systems begin with regular sanitation and monitoring of collections to detect castings from various pests, and checking insect traps laid out {{to capture and}} identify which pests are present. Some pests, such as <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> and flour beetles, feed on dried insects. When an infestation is present, treatment may be necessary. Freezing is commonly used to rid insect collections of pests. Alternatively, inert gases {{may be used for}} an [...] fumigation - depriving the pests of oxygen to exterminate, and in extreme cases chemical fumigation proven to be safe for collections and people may be used.|$|R
50|$|Pests: There {{are many}} types of pests, from insects to small mammals such as rodents that can infest an organic {{collection}} of all types. In particular, these pests can colonize textiles and cause irreparable damage. Other examples {{of the types of}} pests that can afflict historical flags and banners include cloth moths and <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles.</b> It is important to be vigilant of possible signs of infestation and to take preemptive measures to ensure infestation and damage does not occur. Professionals charged with the care and preservation of collections work to develop and enforce Integrated Pest Management plans (IPM) to ensure proper steps are taken to protect historic items such as flags and banners.|$|R
40|$|It is an {{established}} {{fact that many}} insects which are now serious pests were once harmless species living on wild plants and other ”natural” sources of food. As soon as mankind provided their natural food, or at least an adequate substitute for their natural food, in bulk by cultivating plants, these animals were able to multiply {{to such an extent}} that they became a very serious problem. A well-known example is the Colorado Beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) which originally lived in North America on a few wild species of Solanaceæ, but later attacked the introduced potato plants and thus became the worst insect pest of potato crops, not only in its native country, but also in Europe. Clothes Moths and <b>Carpet</b> <b>Beetles</b> are also serious pests because they are highly specialised in their nutritional requirements and use the protein keratin as a staple food. Keratin also happens to be the main constituent of wool and hair, the essential fibres for our winter clothing, our blankets, carpets, rugs, upholstered furniture and other textile materials, fur goods, etc. It goes without saying that these articles only became available at the time when prehistoric man started to use animal skins as clothing and to live in more or less permanent settlements. It is most unlikely that the evolution of the Clothes Moths and <b>Carpet</b> <b>Beetles</b> coincided with the early history of human civilisation. Consequently only the alternative remains, viz., that these insects were already living on accumulations of keratinaceous material available in nature and only became pests because man, most conveniently from the point of view of the insects, assembled considerable quantities of wool and hair...|$|R
