The distribution of the local Nusselt number Nu on the rotating disk is governed by three nondimensional fluid-dynamic parameters: preswirl ratio beta(p), rotational Reynolds number Reo, and turbulent flow parameter lambda(T). This paper describes heat transfer measurements obtained from a scaled model of a gas turbine rotor-stator cavity, where the flow structure is representative of that found in the engine. The experiments reveal that Nu on the rotating disk is axisymmetric except {{in the region of}} the receiver holes, where significant two-dimensional variations have been measured.

The LEM is a thermometer-like device actuated by the volume expansion of the Li6. This “liquid control rod” can keep the reactor power almost constant throughout the design life.Partial load operation is possible by adjusting the primary <b>coolant</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> Reactor power will be in proportional with the primary <b>coolant</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> due to LEMs reactivity feedback. The LRM is composed of an envelope divided by a frozen seal into two chambers.

Coolant heating {{can be achieved by}} heat release from the primary pump circulation. Then the frozen seal of the LRM will melt at the hot standby temperature (approximately 780 °C), and Li6 is released slowly from lower level (active core level) to the upper level to achieve a positive reactivity increase.It will take 7(11) hours to complete startup. The LIMs assure sufficient negative reactivity feedback in unprotected transients. The LRMs enable an automated reactor startup by detecting the hot standby temperature of the primary coolant. All these systems use Li6 and are actuated by highly reliable physical properties (volume expansion of Li6 for LEM, and frozen seal melting for LIM and LRM). A configuration with Quick LEMs requires 3+(1) LEMs of smaller size than a configuration with Slow LEMs requiring 24 LEMs.The RAPID-L is equipped with 28 LEMs, 16 LIMs and 16 LRMs in the design concept. Two of the 16 LRM are reserves or dummies. It is a very redundant system. Failure of some of these devices would result in only a slight temperature deviation of the coolant. In case that most of the LEMs fail, the burn-up compensation by the LEMs could be impossible, and the reactor would shut down.|$|E
