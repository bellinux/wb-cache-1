25|$|Skin/hide beetles – family Dermestidae. <b>Hide</b> <b>beetles</b> are {{important}} {{in the final stages}} of decomposition of a carcass. The adults and larvae feed on the dried skin, tendons and bone left by fly larvae. <b>Hide</b> <b>beetles</b> are the only beetle with the enzymes necessary for breaking down keratin, a protein component of hair.|$|R
50|$|Species of Trogidae often feed on decomposing carcasses. In one lab {{experiment}} done in 1998 by the Department of Zoology at the University of Melbourne, the <b>hide</b> <b>beetles</b> ate all tissues on a sheep carcass {{and left}} the bones.

50|$|Modern {{methods of}} meat slaughtering, storage, and {{distribution}} have reduced potential infestations of <b>hide</b> <b>beetles.</b> Proper housekeeping {{is crucial for}} the prevention of infestations. Dead insects in homes usually attract these beetles because they are a prime food source for <b>hide</b> and larder <b>beetles.</b> Food must be tightly sealed or stored in a refrigerator to avoid any beetle access. Freezing food for a week or heating meat in a pan or microwave for prolonged lengths can kill insects found in infested foods and prevent them from spreading.|$|R
50|$|Trogidae are {{characterized}} by their distinct soil-encrusted, warty, or bumpy appearance. They are usually brown, gray, or black in color and are covered with short, dense setae. Their body shape is oblong to oval with a flat abdomen and their length varies from 2 to 20 mm. The antenna of <b>hide</b> <b>beetles</b> are usually short and clubbed. The hardened elytra of Trogidae, which are generally covered with small knobs giving the beetle their rough appearance, meet along the midline {{of the body and}} cover the entire abdomen and well-developed wings. Their heads are bent down and covered by the pronotum. They also have heavy limbs and spurs resembling those of scarab beetles. Trogidae larvae are a creamy yellow/white in color, except at their caudal end which darkens as it accumulates feces. Their heads are dark and heavily sclerotized. The abdominal segments of <b>hide</b> <b>beetles</b> have at least one or more transverse rows of setae.|$|R

40|$|Polyandry-induced sperm {{competition}} {{is assumed to}} impose costs on males through reduced per capita paternity success. In contrast, studies focusing on the consequences of polyandry for females report increased oviposition rates and fertility. For these species, there is potential for the increased female fecundity associated with polyandry to offset the costs to males of shared paternity. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the proportion and number of offspring sired by males mated with monandrous and polyandrous females in the <b>hide</b> <b>beetle,</b> Dermestes maculates, both for males mating with different females and for males remating with the same female. In 4 mating treatments, monandrous females mated either once or twice with the same male and polyandrous females mated either twice with 2 different males or thrice with 2 males (where 1 male mated twice). Polyandrous and twice-mating monandrous females displayed greater fecundity and fertility than singly mating monandrous females. Moreover, males remated to the same female had greater paternity regardless of whether that female mated with another male. In both polyandrous treatments, male mating order did not affect paternity success. Finally, although the proportion of eggs sired decreased if a male mated with a polyandrous female, multiply mating females or females that remated with a previous mate laid significantly more eggs and thus {{the actual number of}} eggs sired was comparable. Thus, males do not necessarily accrue a net fitness loss when mating with polyandrous females. This may explain the absence of any obvious defensive paternity-protection traits in <b>hide</b> <b>beetles</b> and other species. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of male age on reproductive success after a single mating has been explored widely; however, {{few studies have}} investigated whether quantitative or qualitative differences in male sperm {{are responsible for the}} observed patterns. Moreover, the role of male age on sperm competitive ability has been largely ignored. We examined the importance of male age on the probability and amount of sperm transferred during a single mating and explored whether sperm competitive ability varies with male age in the <b>hide</b> <b>beetle</b> Dermestes maculatus, a species where sperm viability does not vary with male age. We also investigated whether sperm transfer rates varied with female age. We found that the probability of sperm transfer and the amount of sperm transferred varied with male, but not female, age. All males performed behaviorally successful copulations, but intermediate-age and old males were more likely to transfer sperm successfully and also transferred a greater quantity of sperm than young males. Old males were less likely to transfer sperm than intermediate-age males, but if they did transfer sperm successfully, they transferred comparable amounts. Sperm competitive ability varied with male age and reflected the quantity of sperm transferred. On average, intermediate-age males achieved greater fertilization success when competing against young or old males than when competing against other intermediate-age males. Old males were poor competitors against intermediate-age males, but they achieved significantly higher rates of fertilization when competing against young males. Our findings suggest that quantitative differences in the amount of sperm transferred determine male success in sperm competition in the <b>hide</b> <b>beetle.</b> Copyright 2007. female age; male age; sperm competition; sperm transfer...|$|R
50|$|Dermestes maculatus, <b>hide</b> <b>beetles,</b> {{also have}} the {{potential}} to offer investigators an estimation of the time since death in homicide or questionable cases. Similar to the use of flies in forensic entomology, the arrival of D. maculatus to carrion occurs in a predictable succession. Adult D. maculatus beetles generally arrive 5 to 11 days after death. In an attempt to refine this relatively wide range, recent research has repeated arthropod succession studies. These studies are applied to estimate the arrival of various species of Dermestidae after death. Development for Dermestids is temperature dependent, and the optimal temperature for D. maculatus is 30˚C. Development data is normalized using Accumulated Degree Days. Dermestids can also be used in cases involving entomotoxicology, where feces and shed larval skins can be analyzed for toxins.|$|R

40|$|Skins {{and hides}} are {{perishable}} {{resources that can}} be damaged by parasitic diseases and human error, which result in downgrading or rejection. This {{study was conducted to}} identify defect types and to determine their prevalence in pickled sheep and wet blue goat skins and wet blue hides. Each selected skin or hide was examined for defects in natural light and the defects were graded according to established quality criteria in Ethiopian standard manuals. Major defects were captured by digital photography. The major pre-slaughter defects included scratches (64. 2 %), cockle (ekek) (32. 8 %), wounds or scars (12. 6 %), lesions from pox or lumpy skin disease (6. 1 %), poor substance (5 %), branding marks (2. 3 %) and tick bites (1. 5 %). The presence of grain scratches in wet blue hides (76. 3 %) was significantly higher than in pickled sheep (67. 2 %) and wet blue goat (59. 1 %) skins. The major slaughter defects included flay cuts or scores, holes, poor pattern and vein marks, with a higher occurrence in wet blue goat skins (28. 7 %; P < 0. 001) than in wet blue hides (22. 8 %) and pickled sheep skins (11. 1 %). The most prevalent postslaughter defects were grain cracks (14. 9 %), <b>hide</b> <b>beetle</b> damage (8 %), damage caused by heat or putrefaction (3. 7 %) and machine-induced defects (0. 5 %). Grain cracks (27. 04 %) and <b>hide</b> <b>beetle</b> damage (13. 9 %) in wet blue goat skins were significantly more common than in wet blue hides and pickled sheep skins. These defects cause depreciation {{in the value of the}} hides and skins. Statistically significant (P < 0. 001) higher rejection rates were recorded for wet blue hides (82. 9 %) than for pickled sheep skins (18. 3 %) and wet blue goat skins (8. 5 %).

40|$|Abstract Introduction The <b>hide</b> <b>beetle</b> Dermestes maculatus (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) feeds as {{an adult}} and larva on decomposing animal remains and {{can also be found}} on human corpses. Therefore, {{forensic}} entomological questions with regard to when and how the first receptive females appear on carcasses are important, as the developmental stages of their larvae can be used to calculate the post-mortem interval. To date, we know that freshly emerged males respond to the cadaver odour of post-bloated carcasses (approximately 9 days after death at T mean = 27 °C), being attracted by benzyl butyrate. This component occurs at its highest concentration at this stage of decay. The aim of our {{study was to determine the}} principle of attraction of virgin females to the feeding and breeding substrate. For this purpose, we tested the response of these females to headspace samples of piglet cadavers and male sex pheromones [(Z 9) -unsaturated fatty acid isopropyl esters] in a Y-olfactometer. Because we expected that such an odour combination is of importance for virgin female attraction, we tested the following two questions: 1) Are virgin female <b>hide</b> <b>beetles</b> attracted by a combination of cadaver odour and male sex pheromones? 2) During which decomposition stage do the first virgin females respond to cadaver odour when combined with male sex pheromones? Results We found that young virgin females were attracted to the cadaver by a combination of cadaver odour and male sex pheromones. Neither cadaver odour alone nor male sex pheromones alone was significantly more attractive than a solvent control. Our results also gave a weak indication that the first young virgin females respond as early as the post-bloating stage to its associated decomposition odour when combined with male sex pheromones. Conclusions Our results indicate that freshly emerged males possibly respond to cadaver odour and visit carcasses before virgin females. Being attracted to cadavers when male sex pheromone is perceived as well, virgin females can optimise their reproductive possibilities. </p...|$|R
50|$|Dermestidae are {{a family}} of Coleoptera that are {{commonly}} referred to as skin beetles. Other common names include larder <b>beetle,</b> <b>hide</b> or leather <b>beetles,</b> carpet beetles, and khapra beetles. There are approximately 500 to 700 species worldwide. They can range in size from 1 to 12 mm. Key characteristics for adults are round oval shaped bodies covered in scales or setae. The (usually) clubbed antennae fit into deep grooves. The hind femora also fit into recesses of the coxa. Larvae are scarabaeiform and also have setae.|$|R

The larval midgut of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata contains the cysteine proteinase cathepsin B and H, the aspartate proteinase cathepsin D and leucyl aminopeptidase. Cathepsin B and the serine proteinase trypsin were identified in the larval midgut of the yellow mealworm, Tenebrio molitor. Cathepsin B and the serine proteinase chymotrypsin were identified in the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais. The larger grain borer, Prostephanus truncatus, feeds on the same food source as S. zeamais but uses trypsin, chymotrypsin and leucyl and arginyl aminopeptidase and not cysteine proteinases for digestion.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{fuzzy system}} modeling methods implicitly assume data generated {{from a single}} task, which is essentially not in accordance with many practical scenarios where data can be acquired {{from the perspective of}} multiple tasks. Although one can build an individual fuzzy system model for each task, the result indeed tells us that the individual modeling approach will get poor generalization ability due to ignoring the intertask hidden correlation. In order to circumvent this shortcoming, we consider a general framework for preserving the independent information among different tasks and mining hidden correlation information among all tasks in multitask fuzzy modeling. In this framework, a low-dimensional subspace (structure) is assumed to be shared among all tasks and hence be the hidden correlation information among all tasks. Under this framework, a multitask Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system model called MTCS-TSK-FS (TSK-FS for multiple tasks with <b>common</b> <b>hidden</b> structure), based on the classical L 2 -norm TSK fuzzy system, is proposed in this paper. The proposed model can not only take advantage of independent sample information from the original space for each task, but also effectively use the intertask <b>common</b> <b>hidden</b> structure among multiple tasks to enhance the generalization performance of the built fuzzy systems. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the applicability and distinctive performance of the proposed multitask fuzzy system model in multitask regression learning scenarios.

40|$|Phoretic mites {{are likely}} the most {{abundant}} arthropods found on carcases and corpses. They outnumber their scavenger carriers in both number and diversity. Many phoretic mites travel on scavenger insects and are highly specific; they will arrive on a particular species of host and no other. Because of this, they may be useful as trace indicators of their carriers even when their carriers are absent. Phoretic mites can be valuable markers of time. They are usually found in a specialised transitional transport or dispersal stage, often moulting and transforming to adults shortly after arrival on a carcase or corpse. Many are characterised by faster development and generation cycles than their carriers. Humans are normally unaware, but we too carry mites; they are skin mites that are present in our clothes. More than 212 phoretic mite species associated with carcases {{have been reported in}} the literature. Among these, mites belonging to the Mesostigmata form the dominant group, represented by 127 species with 25 phoretic mite species belonging to the family Parasitidae and 48 to the Macrochelidae. Most of these mesostigmatids are associated with particular species of flies or carrion beetles, though some are associated with small mammals arriving during the early stages of decomposition.
