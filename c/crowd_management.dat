5|$|Before {{heading out}} of Brazil on a mid-1991 European tour, Sepultura {{performed}} one more concert in São Paulo, the country's largest city. It {{took place at}} Praça Charles Miller (in front of Estádio do Pacaembu), on May 11. Local military police expected 10,000 to attend. 30,000 showed up instead, making <b>crowd</b> <b>management</b> nearly impossible. Six people were hurt, 18 were arrested and one was murdered with an axe. A week before, a young man was stabbed to death at a Ramones concert in São Paulo, during a brawl between headbangers and skinheads. These events were followed by a huge mainstream media backlash throughout the country against rock music.|$|E

40|$|Tourism <b>crowding</b> <b>management</b> is an {{important}} part of sustainable development at tourist attractions. This study seeks to develop a tourism <b>crowding</b> <b>management</b> model for cultural attraction sites in China. Three kinds of studies were used to construct the model. The three studies, which were designed using quantitative and qualitative techniques, were undertaken in Xi’an, western China. In the first two studies the actual numbers of visitors at component parts of five tourist attractions were recorded. Next, visitor responses to these kinds of levels of crowding were assessed. In the third study senior managers were interviewed and asked to explain their approaches to <b>crowding</b> <b>management.</b> Taken together the information collected from the three studies helped build a model which plots the driving forces shaping tourism crowding at cultural sites...|$|R

25|$|A {{collection}} {{of people can}} also exhibit swarm behaviour, such as pedestrians or soldiers swarming the parapets. In Cologne, Germany, two biologists from the University of Leeds demonstrated flock like behaviour in humans. The group of people exhibited similar behavioural pattern to a flock, where if {{five percent of the}} flock changed direction the others would follow. If one person was designated as a predator and everyone else was to avoid him, the flock behaved very much like a school of fish. Understanding how humans interact in crowds is important if <b>crowd</b> <b>management</b> is to effectively avoid casualties at football grounds, music concerts and subway stations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Crowd</b> <b>management</b> {{proved to}} be difficult, {{resulting}} in both spectator injury and death. Over {{the course of the}} day, the Hells Angels became increasingly agitated as the crowd turned more aggressive. At a later murder trial of Hells Angel Alan Passaro, a security guard testified he heard the Hells Angels being summoned over the loudspeakers when the helicopter bearing The Rolling Stones landed. Debate after the event was over whether the Hells Angels were to manage security for the entire concert or just for The Rolling Stones. Sam Cutler, the Stones' agent who had arranged to pay the Hells Angels said their role was as bodyguards to the Rolling Stones. This was denied by the Hells Angels as well as others connected to the event. During the opening act of Santana, the Hells Angels surged into the crowd numerous times to keep persons off stage.|$|E
2500|$|With {{a current}} daily {{ridership}} of around 560,000 passengers, the MRT-3 operates significantly above its designed capacity of between 360,000 and 380,000 passengers per day. Operating over capacity since 2004, [...] {{government officials have}} admitted that capacity and system upgrades are overdue, although the DOTC never acted on the numerous capacity expansion proposals of the private owners. [...] In the absence of major investment in improving system safety and reliability, DOTC management of the MRT-3 has resorted to experimenting with and/or implementing other solutions to reduce strain on the system, including <b>crowd</b> <b>management</b> on station platforms, the proposed implementation of peak-hour express train service. [...] However, some of these solutions, such as platform <b>crowd</b> <b>management,</b> are unpopular with passengers.|$|E

5000|$|The {{games are}} useful for new players who {{are not used to}} playing in front of very large <b>crowds.</b> <b>Management</b> often uses the games to {{evaluate}} newly signed players. Veteran players will generally play only for about a quarter of each game (or less) in order to avoid injury; the third preseason game (or fourth for the participants in the Hall of Fame game) is generally the exception, since starters play well into the third quarter and both teams game plan for the game like the regular season. [...] Thus, first-stringers' playing time is kept brief in the exhibition season, and in fact players are not paid their regular salaries for exhibitions, but the same per diem which they receive for training camp.|$|R
40|$|Studies on {{tourists}} crowding {{are developed}} {{to explore the}} perception of crowding, and these studies indicate crowding influence on sustainable development of tourist destinations. This study aims to reveal the influential factors of tourists’ perceived crowding. We obtained data from interviewing over 400 tourists and five senior tourism officials in Xi’an, China. This study firstly applies factor analysis to identify the constructed variables of tourists’ motivations from the principle component analysis. It then examines the correlation between nationality and perceived crowding. Consequently, a multiple regression is used to identify the connection between motivations and perceived crowding. The {{results of the study}} indicate nationality and motivation as two significant influential factors to perceived <b>crowding</b> <b>management.</b> This study also shows that management in tourist destinations would benefit from provision of the authentic travel experience integrated with zoning the travel destination...|$|R

2500|$|Recognition {{of group}} {{activities}} is {{fundamentally different from}} single, or multi-user activity recognition in that {{the goal is to}} recognize the behavior of the group as an entity, rather than the activities of the individual members within it. [...] Group behavior is emergent in nature, meaning that the properties of the behavior of the group are fundamentally different then the properties of the behavior of the individuals within it, or any sum of that behavior. [...] The main challenges are in modeling the behavior of the individual group members, as well as the roles of the individual within the group dynamic [...] and their relationship to emergent behavior of the group in parallel. [...] Challenges which must still be addressed include quantification of the behavior and roles of individuals who join the group, integration of explicit models for role description into inference algorithms, and scalability evaluations for very large groups and crowds. [...] Group activity recognition has applications for <b>crowd</b> <b>management</b> and response in emergency situations, as well as for social networking and Quantified Self applications.|$|E

40|$|Corporate scandals, {{reflected}} in excessive management compensation and fraudulent accounts, cause considerable damage. Agency theory?s insistence on linking the compensation of managers and directors {{as closely as}} possible to firm performance is a major reason for these scandals. They cannot be overcome by improving variable pay for performance, as selfish extrinsic motivation is reinforced. Based on the common pool approach to the firm, institutions are proposed which serve to raise intrinsically motivated corporate virtue. More importance is to be attributed to fixed pay and strengthening the legitimacy of authorities by procedural fairness, relational contracts and organizational citizenship behavior.
