50|$|<b>Cheque</b> <b>truncation</b> means {{stopping}} {{the flow of}} the physical cheques issued by a drawer to the drawee branch. The physical instrument is truncated at some point en route to the drawee branch and an electronic image of the cheque is sent to the drawee branch along with the relevant information like the MICR fields, date of presentation, presenting banks etc. This would eliminate the need to move the physical instruments across branches, except in exceptional circumstances, resulting in an effective reduction in the time required for payment of cheques, the associated cost of transit and delays in processing, etc., thus speeding up the process of collection or realization of cheques.|$|E
50|$|Instrument-specific {{legislation}} {{includes the}} Cheques Act 1960, {{part of the}} Bills of Exchange Act 1908, which codifies aspects related to the cheque payment instrument, notably the procedures for the endorsement, presentment and payment of cheques. A 1995 amendment provided for the electronic presentment of cheques and removed the previous requirement to deliver cheques physically to the paying bank, opening the way for <b>cheque</b> <b>truncation</b> and imaging. Truncation allows for the transmission of an electronic image of {{all or part of}} the cheque to the paying bank’s branch, instead of the cumbersome physical presentment. This reduced the total cheque clearance time, as well as eliminating the costs of physically moving the cheque.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cheque</b> <b>Truncation</b> System(CTS) is an {{automatic}} cheque clearance system implemented by RBI. CTS uses cheque image, {{instead of the}} physical cheque itself, for cheque clearance thus reducing the turn around time drastically. This approach holds back the physical movement of cheque from presenting bank to the drawee bank. In CTS, digital image of the cheque is protected using standard public key and symmetric key encryptions like RSA, triple DES etc. This involves a lot of computation overhead and key management. The security also depends on the hard mathematical problem and is only computationally secure. Information theoretically secure, secret image sharing techniques {{can be used in}} the CTS for the secure and efficient processing of cheque image. In this paper, we propose two simple and efficient secret image sharing schemes and a <b>Cheque</b> <b>Truncation</b> System based on these algorithms. In the proposed scheme,the presenting bank is acting as the dealer and the participants are the customer, and the drawee bank. The dealer should generate the shares of cheque and distributes it to customer and drawee bank. The validity of the shares are important during the reconstruction process. The proposed scheme also suggests a method for cheating detection which identify any invalid shares submitted by the customers, using the hashing technique. The experimental results shows that the proposed scheme is efficient and secure compared with the existing scheme...|$|E
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{is growing}} day-by-day {{in the current}} world scenario. Organizations are excited and worried {{at the same time}} to use cloud computing features as it will require for them to move their data on public cloud. Resource utilization is the main advantage of cloud computing which results in storing data of multiple clients in one place. Private cloud is preferred by the companies but it does not provide all the advantages of cloud computing. Cloud providers are working hard to secure their infrastructure and the stored data in cloud. To secure data, encryption is the most preferred solution. But the problem with traditional cryptographic methods is that they take huge amount of computation power and time in processing the encrypted data. Visual Cryptography is a cryptographic method which takes less amount of time to encrypt or decrypt data and can be applied in the field of cloud to improve its security parameters. It can also be used in the financial field such as <b>Cheque</b> <b>Truncation</b> System to transfer the images securely...|$|E
40|$|Business {{information}} systems, also termed as Enterprise resource planning (ERP) {{systems have}} emerged as the core of successful information management and an enterprise backbone for many organizations business success. Organizations have been developing and implementing computer-based Enterprise resource planning (ERP) at an increasing rate for the last 35 years. However, evidence indicates that many computer-based ERP's are not as successful {{as they should be}} and many projects may be considered unsuccessful. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze determinants of successful implementation of MIS projects. The difficulty of ERP development and implementations has been widely cited in literature. However, research on the critical factors for the initial and 'O-ngoingERP implementation success is rare and fragmented. In this research, 'the focus was on the Kenyan Banking industry which is introducing ERPs in their operations. Factors affecting the system development projects were analyzed. Specifically, a case on the <b>Cheque</b> <b>Truncation</b> system was applied in analyzing the effects of project team, system design, users' contribution and system acceptance.

40|$|The {{liability}} of banks in electronic fund transfer (EFT) transactions {{is discussed in}} this thesis under the British and the United States law. The thesis covers banks’ liability in electronic credit and debit transfers. It covers banks’ liability in Electronic Fund Transfer at the Point Of Sale (EFTPOS), Automatic Teller Machines (ATM) and home and office banking. Liability of banks in credit card transactions and <b>cheque</b> <b>truncation</b> falls {{outside the scope of}} this thesis. In the absence of British legislation in this area, an analogy is made with the traditional methods of payment. An attempt is also made to extract the applicable rules from the general principles of law and the banking practice. The discussion, under the United States law, relies on analysing the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 and Article 4 A of the Uniform Commercial Code, which concern banks’ liability in consumer and commercially based EFT transactions. The thesis starts by analysing the legal nature of payment orders. In particular, whether a payment order is a negotiable instrument, a creation of trust funds, an assignation or merely a mandate from a customer to his bank. Chapter two discusses banks’ liability for failure to make an EFT transaction. This encompasses banks’ liability for complete failure to effect an EFT transaction and for improper implementation of such a transaction. Chapter three discusses the right to stop payment, completion of payment, irrevocability and banks’ liability for failure to stop payment. Chapter four discusses banks’ liability for erroneous EFT transactions. This includes allocation of losses resulting from errors in payment orders and errors committed by banks during the execution process of such orders. Chapter five discusses banks’ liability for unauthorised EFT transactions. Issues such as authentication of payment orders, security measures adopted by banks and allocation of losses resulting from unauthorised transactions are discussed in this chapter. Chapter six discusses the recoverability of damages for banks’ failure to implement customers’ instructions properly. It discusses what measures of damages are applicable in certain situations such as banks’ complete failure to make an EFT transaction, failure to transfer funds on time etc. The thesis is completed by summary and conclusion...|$|E
