5000|$|Sint-Oedenrode {{originated}} on {{the banks}} of the river the Dommel. The presence of this river has left a mark on the development of the landscape and the main parts of the town. The valley landscape with meadows, pastures and small landscape elements such as steep edges and pools was fairly open. The higher, cultivated fields formed with its gibbous fields, hawthorn hedges and wooden windbreaks a more <b>closed</b> <b>landscape.</b> In the late 13th century, the Dukes of Brabant were about to issue a perpetual lease of common grounds. For example, in 1314 the lease issued the [...] "Bodem van Elde". This vast humid forest and heathland was virtually uninhabitable. The border of this congregation, which was located between Sint Michielsgestel, Boxtel, Schijndel, Sint-Oedenrode and Liempde, was formed by the river the Dommel. The commissioning of the Bodem of Elde led to the emergence of the characteristic gibbous fields in this part of the Meierij. Some of these fields in this area existed for centuries in the same form and can nowadays be very well identified by their unchanged shape. On some of the parts with very loamy soils in Sint-Oedenrode there were many poplars planted from 1750 on. Between 1760 and 1780 the largest increase in silviculture took place in the municipalities Schijndel, Sint-Oedenrode, Veghel and Udenhout. Following the planting of poplars, the pattern of sand paths and wet stream valley soils were formed which characterizes the Meierijs [...] "Poplar Landscape" [...] till this day. This landscape was in fact purely economic, since the poplar cultivation served the clog industry. The core of this clog industry, and therefore of the poplar cultivation, was mainly formed by the municipalities Sint-Oedenrode, Schijndel, Veghel, Liempde, Best and Boxtel. In the nineteenth century Sint-Oedenrode grew again because of this industry, which reached its peak in the first half of the 20th century.The reclamation of the remaining waste land known as the Schijndelse Heath, especially the Kienehoef, took place since the 18th century.|$|E

Gabon is characterized by a forested <b>closed</b> <b>landscape,</b> and southern France by an open Mediterranean landscape. The genetic diversity between Gabon and France populations did not differ significantly (P >  0. 05). Contrary to our expectation, this study shows a moderate level of genetic differentiation between these two distant countries (Fst =  0. 0979) and a low genetic structure among Gabonese and French populations (Fst =  0. 0291 and 0. 0275 respectively).

30|$|Several study {{sites have}} forests with high quality trees (mainly pines) which have value as timber and therefore, {{inhabitants}} do not ruin them by making charcoal or lime, which {{was done in}} regions with a degraded, bushy vegetation. Some interviewees own separate forest patches with trees for firewood (lower situated) and high quality trees (located higher). People always need permission and tax payment for logging. Generally, all settlements are more vegetated now; mainly the areas around the houses became greener because {{of an increase in}} fruit trees, grasslands and bushy areas at the expense of croplands. Therefore, most settlements gained a more <b>closed</b> <b>landscape</b> without attributing this to abandonment alone. In Zagorje, the central plain traditionally comprised open space but during the 1980 s, new houses appeared with an increase in gardens and plum trees. The study sites Gornji Brčeli and Godinje show many new bushes and trees due to the abandonment of croplands on cultivation terraces, leading to an almost inaccessible vegetated area. A result of the emerging forest is the increased amount of mushrooms, berries and herbs in these settlements, enabling more inhabitants to collect and sell them.|$|E

A broad range of remotely sensed data is available to map these small linear elements in rural landscapes, {{but only a few}} of them have been evaluated for this purpose. In this study, we evaluate and compare various optical remote-sensing data including high and very high spatial resolution, active and passive, and airborne and satellite data to produce quantitative information on the hedgerow network structure and to analyse qualitative information from the maps produced in order to estimate the true value of these maps. We used an object-based image analysis that proved to be efficient for detecting and mapping thin elements in complex landscapes. The analysis was performed at two scales, the hedgerow network scale and the tree canopy scale, on a study site that shows a strong landscape gradient of wooded hedgerow density. The results (1) highlight the key role of spectral resolution on the detection and mapping of wooded elements with remotely sensed data; (2) underline the fact that every satellite image provides relevant information on wooded network structures, even in <b>closed</b> <b>landscape</b> units, whatever the spatial resolution; and (3) indicate that light detection and ranging data offer important insights into future strategies for monitoring hedgerows...|$|E

40|$|The essay {{deals with}} the hill-fort on the {{mountain}} Halleberg, Sweden, its wall design, functionality, dating and its possible function as a central location and a place of worship of the ancestors. The Halleberg hill-fort consists of a 1500 meters long at times cohesive stonewalls which together blocked the mountain from its surroundings. Hallberg's natural vertical scree and cliffs along with the masonry blocked the whole mountain from the surroundings. The hill-forts, with few exceptions are largely not investigated archaeologically and its functionality and role in the ancient society is based on outdated research on the subject. The current archaeological interpretation is that hill-forts served as temporary defense in times of unrest or served as center of power for a social elite. The prevailing view in the archaeological sphere is that the hill-forts had a variety of functions and that its functionality and role in ancient society has varied. Halleberg´s strongest wall sections are at the mountain's south-eastern part where the natural driveway, Storgårdsklev is located. Along with the massive masonry of the walls in Bokedalen Storgårdsklev functioned as the hill-forts main entrance. At places along the walls are the remains {{of what could be}} interpreted as stacked rocks and possible fire cracked stone. These structural features indicate that the walls were built during the early Iron Age. Very likely has its function like other hill-forts have been varied and changed based on the community, organization and internal and external disturbances. The essay's main interpretation is that the hill-fort served as a defensive fortress. Moreover it is possible that walls of the hill-fort had a symbolic role as a border between two separate rooms in the landscape. The fencing of Halleberg turned the whole mountain to a <b>closed</b> <b>landscape,</b> separated from the surroundings.

30|$|The {{evolution}} of land abandonment in rural Montenegro since about 1950 at 14 local study sites and their underlying processes has been examined. Certain trends can be partially explained through geographical conditions. Settlements with steep slope gradients and large distances to cities show {{an increase in}} overgrown, bushy lands, while the cultivated area decreased for villages at high altitudes, and small distances to cities led to more house construction. Also, demographic and social circumstances demonstrated {{their impact on the}} landscape. Villages where lands were extensively maintained turned out to be mainly characterized by emigration and aging of their inhabitants; such extensification was also significantly correlated with the woody vegetation cover in the 1970 s. Five settlement profiles could be distinguished: urbanized, intensified (both comprising only one settlement), extensified, overgrown and forested types of settlements. Most study sites displayed a trend of extensification, with maintained grasslands and fruit trees instead of traditional croplands and much livestock. Also, often areas became overgrown by bushes and vegetation, mainly at edges and on mountain areas of settlement territories, but also centrally within villages overgrown grasslands occur. These processes -along with the increase of fruit trees- caused a shift from rather open to more <b>closed</b> <b>landscapes</b> within settlements.|$|R

40|$|A {{major part}} of the Netherlands {{consists}} of meadows used for dairy farming. These meadows are relatively wet and are the main habitat for a group of bird species, known as ‘meadow birds’. They are defined as bird species of which the population that occurs in the Netherlands is largely dependent on agriculturally used grasslands as a breeding site. Meadow birds are typically Dutch because nowhere else in the world does this assemblage of species breed together in the same habitat. The Netherlands is especially important for the Black-tailed Godwit (Limosa limosa) of which circa 50 % of the European population breeds in Dutch meadows. Because of a recent decline of meadow bird species, various studies into many life characteristics have been started. It was found that the decline must be attributed to changes during the breeding season, especially to agricultural intensification resulting in a lowered breeding success. This thesis however focuses on nest site selection of meadow bird breeding pairs early in the season. Three habitat requirements are important then: land use, groundwater level and landscape openness. When quantifying the relative importance of these three requirements, landscape openness is found to be the most important, followed by land use and groundwater level. Similarly, an open landscape {{has been shown to be}} important in many other habitats characterized by openness like deserts, tundras, coasts, bogs and marshes. Predator visibility is the main reason for the importance of openness: meadow birds want to visually locate their potential predators and deter it from the breeding site. This is only possible in an open landscape setting with few landscape elements. A literature review confirms that meadow birds select nest sites at a distance from landscape elements. Apart from view-obstructing elements (like forest or buildings), also flat elements (like roads) result in disturbance distances. Human-used elements cause the largest disturbance distances, but elements that are not used by human beings also still do. Furthermore, occupied predator nests result in a surrounding area with lowered densities of meadow birds, irrespective whether the predator’s nest is situated in an open or <b>closed</b> <b>landscape.</b> For Black-tailed Godwit, five core breeding areas in lowland Netherlands were identified where it still breeds in the Netherlands in 2020. These core areas are all open meadow landscapes with high water levels, resulting in an agricultural management that can sustain a healthy godwit population. The five core areas are not officially designated as reserves and, also, two of them are located in the western provinces where the largest pressure of landscape clutter, especially due to urbanization, occurs. For the conservation of the relevant flyway population of the Black-tailed Godwit, EU member states can appoint Special Protection Areas (SPAs). However, the Netherlands did not formally appoint SPAs for its breeding population, but only for the period outside the breeding season when the SPAs function as post-breeding staging areas. Connectivity between SPAs and core breeding areas was however found to be not optimal, resulting in a bottleneck in the protection of Black-tailed Godwi...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} 1. Insects {{are highly}} dependent on ambient temperatures to ensure their biological functions. Their persistence in the environment and their resistance to unfavorable temperatures are governed by their physiological thermal tolerance. 2. Global change extends beyond climatic conditions to encompass modifications to the landscape. However, studies of climate change and landscape composition effects on ecosystem services, such as biological control, are commonly performed independently. Moreover, coarse scales are not always relevant when assessing climate change’s impacts on ectotherms. We aimed {{to better understand the}} ecological relationships that may exist between microclimatic variation and insect thermal tolerance across a landscape composition gradient. 3. To determine how landscape composition may impact insect thermal tolerance, parasitic wasps (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae) of aphids were sampled along a landscape gradient from “closed” to “open” habitats. Sampling was performed during the winter 2013 / 14 and spring 2014 in cereal fields of Brittany, France. Meteorological data were recorded along this gradient. 4. First, our results show an influence of landscape composition on local microclimate. Additionally, parasitoids from open landscapes had a higher tolerance to low temperatures, leading to higher physiological costs, compared to parasitoids from <b>closed</b> <b>landscapes.</b> This trend was stronger in winter than in spring. 5. These results have numerous implications in the context of climate change, suggesting that targeted landscape management practices could create sheltered microclimatic areas that reduce the physiological costs of thermal tolerance, and promote the persistence of biological control agents...|$|R

40|$|Close {{examination}} of the geographic position of Early Neolithic settlements in SE-Europe shows that the oldest sites are almost exclusively situated in some very specific biogeographic areas. These earliest Neolithic settlements are all concentrated {{in a region that}} Pavle Cikovac calls the Sub-Mediterranean-Aegean biogeographic region. It covers the northern and north-western edge of the Aegean, including Thessaly, Greek Macedonia and Greek Thrace, and extends further into the Balkans, but only along the valleys of the Vardar (Axios), Struma (Strymon) and Mesta (Nestos) rivers. Surprisingly, although Thrace is the <b>closest</b> <b>landscape</b> to Anatolia, it does not contain any sites of the earliest phase of the Neolithic at all beyond the narrow zone of the northern Marmara. In the present paper we explain this remarkable situation in terms of the natural environment in this particular region of the southern Balkans. To begin, we propose that the lack of oldest Early Neolithic settlements in Thrace is related to the extreme microclimate of this region. As shown by modern vegetation analogues, Thracian oriental hornbeam-downy oak forests are exposed to stronger continental influence with frosts in the winter and average temperatures during the coldest months that are ca. 2 – 3 °C lower than those in the Central Balkans that have Sub-Mediterranean vegetation. In general terms, what we may expect is that the earliest Neolithic groups would first appear in regions with similarly mild conditions, on a yearly average, to those in the Mediterranean. Such mild conditions are indeed present in the Sub-Mediterranean biogeographic region. On the other hand, before moving further to the north along the north-south oriented river systems of the Central Balkans, the Neolithic economy based on agriculture and stockbreeding would first have to be adapted to the relatively harsh winters in the Balkans. In consequence, it would have been possible to apply the new Neolithic lifestyle in the neighbouring areas of Thrace, Walachia, Dobrudža and the Carpathian Basin only after a certain period of adaptation. Available 14 C-data show that the adaptation period is identical to the time-span of Rapid Climate Change (RCC: 6550 - 6050 calBC) as defined in previous studies. status: accepte...|$|R
