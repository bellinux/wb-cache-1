25|$|The {{capacity}} of an alkaline battery is strongly {{dependent on the}} load. An AA-sized alkaline battery might have an effective {{capacity of}} 3000mAh at low drain, but at a load of 1 ampere, which is common for digital cameras, the capacity could be as little as 700mAh. The voltage of the battery declines steadily during use, so the total usable capacity depends on the cut-off voltage of the application. Unlike Leclanche cells, the alkaline cell delivers about as much capacity on intermittent or continuous light loads. On a heavy load, capacity is reduced on <b>continuous</b> <b>discharge</b> compared with intermittent discharge, but the reduction is less than for Leclanche cells.|$|E

Those circumstances which tend to facilitate the charge of the air by the excited conductor, and also those which tend to keep the tension at the same degree notwithstanding the discharge, assist in producing the glow; whereas those which tend to resist the charge of the air or other dielectric, and those which favour the accumulation of electric force prior to discharge, which, sinking by that act, has to be exalted before the tension can again acquire the requisite degree, favour intermitting discharge, and, therefore, the production of brush or spark. Thus, rarefaction of the air, the removal of large conducting surfaces from the neighbourhood of the glowing termination, the presentation of a sharp point towards it, help to sustain or produce the glow: but the condensation of the air, {{the presentation of the}} hand or other large surface, the gradual approximation of a discharging ball, tend to convert the glow into brush or even spark. All these circumstances may be traced and reduced, in a manner easily comprehensible, to their relative power of assisting to produce, either a <b>continuous</b> <b>discharge</b> to the air, which gives the glow; or an interrupted one, which produces the brush, and, in a more exalted condition, the spark.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{retrospectively}} analyze the electroclinical features, etiology, treatment, and prognosis of 29 patients with Landau–Kleffner syndrome (LKS) with a long-term follow-up. MethodsInclusion criteria were a diagnosis of LKS with: (1) acquired aphasia or verbal auditory aphasia; (2) with or without focal seizures, secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures, absences, or atonic seizures. ResultsMean follow-up was 12 years. All cases except six had seizures. Before the onset of aphasia, developmental language and behavioral disturbances were present in 19 and 14 patients, respectively. All patients had verbal auditory agnosia. Aphasia was severe in 24 patients and moderate in five. Nonlinguistic cognitive dysfunctions were moderate in 14 patients. Behavioral disturbances were found in 16 patients. During the <b>continuous</b> spike-and-wave <b>discharges</b> during slow sleep phase, the spike-wave index was > 85 % in 15, 50 – 85 % in eight, and 30 – 50 % in four. In two patients, the EEG recording showed occasional bilateral spikes, without <b>continuous</b> spike-and-wave <b>discharges</b> during slow sleep. In this phase, the awake EEG recording showed more frequent interictal abnormalities, predominantly in the temporal regions. Eight patients recovered language completely, but the remaining patients continue to have language deficits of different degrees. ConclusionLandau–Kleffner syndrome is an epileptic encephalopathy characterized by acquired verbal auditory aphasia and seizures in most of the patients associated with continuous or almost <b>continuous</b> spike-and-wave <b>discharges</b> during slow wave sleep. The most commonly used treatments were clobazam, ethosuximide, sulthiame. High-dose steroids were also administered. Adequate and early management may avoid language and cognitive deterioration...|$|R
