Patients mostly had normal motility (50 %) or a category 4 disorder and usually weak peristalsis (31. 5 %) according to the Chicago Classification. PFA of healthy controls defined reference ranges for PFI <= 142 and impedance ratio <= 0. 49. Pediatric patients with pressure-flow (PF) characteristics within these limits had normal motility (62 %), most patients with PF characteristics outside these limits also had an abnormal Chicago Classification (61 %).

40|$|SUMMARY The {{degree of}} {{recovery}} of the somatosensory cortical evoked response following a period (15 to 65 minutes) of partial ischemia, produced by temporary occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), was assessed in baboons and related to the local tissue blood flow and Pth before, {{during and after the}} occlusion. Flow was measured using the technique of two-minute hydrogen <b>clearance.</b> <b>Failure</b> of complete {{recovery of the}} evoked response was associated with significantly greater depths of ischemia and tissue hypoxia dur-ing occlusion, and with significantly greater and persisting tissue hypoxia after occlusion, than complete recovery. Complete recovery of the eioked response also was associated with tissue hyperoxia after occlusion. The reduced postocclusive Po 2 levels associated with incomplete recovery of the evoked response suggest that reduced per-fusion during ischemia was sufficiently severe to cause some degree of irreversible anoxic damage. The effect of a brief (three to ten minutes) period of ventilation with air (instead of oxygen) under such low-now conditions was to depress the evoked response significantly further; normally perfused brain, however, was unaffected by this procedure.

40|$|Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in European country ranges in elderly {{patients}} from 4. 5 to 12 % of population {{and has a}} significant effect on quality of life. In these patients, rhinosinusitis is linked to immune functions changes with age and to mucosal paraphysiological alterations such as crusting formations with atrophic epithelium, variations of nasal airflow and modifications of the mucociliary <b>clearance.</b> <b>Failure</b> of medical treatments leads to surgery in patients with persistent symptoms and radiographic signs of CRS. The choice of appropriate post-surgical topic treatments is important for healing time and for preventing mucosal complications such as synechiae, crusting formation and atrophy with secondary bacterial and fungal infections. Aims: Defining the effects of topic alpha-tocopherol acetate administration on nasal mucosa healing after endoscopic sinus surgery in CRS of {{elderly patients}}. Methods: In this study were included 32 patients, mean age 68. 6, who underwent FESS because affected by CRS not responsive to medical treatments. After surgical treatment, we distinguish two groups basing on local nasal therapy. Results: We investigated, in the postoperative time, the role of alpha-tocopherol acetate compared to gomenol oil. Follow-up was performed at 7 – 15  days and 1 – 3  months after surgery. We evaluated mucosal restoration using Rhinoscopy Sum Score and quality of life using Nasal Six Items Symptom Questionnaire.

40|$|ABSTRACT: It {{is known}} that loss of renal {{function}} decreases the hepatic clearance of some drugs, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are unclear. Knowledge of which drugs display reduced hepatic metabolism may be important for appropriate dosing of these drugs in uremic patients. Although no firrn conclusions can be made regarding common pharmacokinetic and metabolic characteristics of drugs that display decreased hepatic metabolism in renal failure, certain observations deserve consideration. It appears that drugs metabolized by oxidation, conjugation, or both may be predisposed to decreased hepatic <b>clearance</b> in renal <b>failure.</b> Drugs that undergo oxidation by the P- 450 DD 6 isozyme {{may be more likely}} to exhibit inhibition whereas those metabolized by the P- 450 IllA 4 isozyme may be spared.

The molecule is subsequently transferred to the hepatocyte in an immunologically identifiable form. Carcinoembryonic antigen has a circulatory half-life of 3. 7 (+/- 0. 8) min, and cellular entry is by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Non-specific fluid pinocytosis and phagocytosis can be excluded as possible mechanisms by the kinetics of <b>clearance</b> and <b>failure</b> of colloidal carbon to inhibit uptake. Substances with known affinity for the hepatic receptors for mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, fucose and galactose all fail to inhibit carcinoembryonic antigen clearance. After two cycles of the Smith degradation, carcinoembryonic antigen is still able to inhibit clearance of the native molecule. Receptor specificity is apparently not dependent on those non-reducing terminal sugars of the native molecule. Performic acid-oxidized carcinoembryonic antigen also inhibits clearance of carcinoembryonic antigen in vivo. Receptor binding is not dependent on tertiary protein conformation.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) {{is the leading cause}} of dementia accounting for over 75 % of all cases. Toxic accumulation of amyloid beta (AB), either by overproduction or some <b>clearance</b> <b>failure,</b> is thought to be an underlying mechanism of the neuronal cell death characteristic of AD – though this amyloid hypothesis has been increasingly challenged in recent years. A compelling alternative hypothesis points to chronic neuroinflammation as a common root in late-life degenerative diseases including AD. Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD: Individuals with APOE-e 4 genotype accumulate more AB, are at high risk of developing AD, and almost half of all AD patients have at least one e 4 allele. Recent studies suggest a bidirectional relationship exists between sleep and AD pathology. Sleep may play an important role in AB clearance and getting good quality sleep versus poor quality sleep might reduce the AD risk associated with the e 4 allele. Taken together, these findings are particularly important given the sleep disruptions commonly associated with AD and the increased burden disrupted sleep poses for AD caregivers. The current review aims to: 1) Identify individuals at high risk for dementia who may benefit most from sleep interventions; 2) Explore the role poor sleep quality plays in exacerbating AD type dementia; 3) Examine the science of sleep interventions to date; and 4) Provide a road map in pursuit of comprehensive sleep interventions, specifically targeted to promote cognitive function and delay progression of dementia...|$|E

40|$|The {{progression}} {{and severity}} of cystic fibrosis (CF) disease results from a failure of pulmonary innate immune functions, reduced mucociliary <b>clearance,</b> and <b>failure</b> of immune mechanisms to successfully opsonize and kill bacteria in airways.

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is {{commonly}} found in the nasopharynx of healthy individuals, yet {{it can be a}} serious pathogen, particularly in the lower respiratory tract, where it can cause severe pneumonia. During pneumococcal pneumonia, anti-bacterial host defense requires the orchestrated expression of innate immunity mediators, initiated by alveolar macrophages and dependent on transcriptional activity driven by Nuclear Factor-B (NF-B). Although the initiation of a pulmonary inflammatory response is critical to anti-pneumococcal defense during pneumonia, how differences in pneumococcal-macrophage interactions can influence this process is unclear. To determine the functional significance of varying macrophage NF-B activation, we examined macrophage responses to pneumococcal stimulation in culture and in mice. Macrophage-pneumococcal interactions resulted in the induction of varied NF-B activation. Two main pathways were revealed regarding host response and disease outcome. Pneumococci that induced efficient macrophage NF-B activation resulted in robust anti-pneumococcal lung defense and bacterial <b>clearance.</b> Conversely, <b>failure</b> to activate effective macrophage NF-B signaling resulted in an altered macrophage response of necroptosis. Overall, we conclude that varying levels of macrophage NF-B activation by pneumococcus can directly influence the severity of infection. Furthermore, inefficient macrophage NF-B activation can also have cytotoxic effects on these critical lung resident cells during pneumonia. The induction of macrophage NF-B activation by S. pneumoniae is as diverse as the population of pneumococcal isolates in the community. A unique host-pathogen interaction exists between pneumococcus and the alveolar macrophage that {{plays an important role in}} anti-pneumococcal defense during pneumonia and in the prevention of cytotoxic consequences induced by virulent pneumococci. This interaction suggests that therapies, which modulate NF-B activation, hold promise for augmenting resistance and ameliorating deleterious effects during pneumococcal pneumonia that could lead to the development of severe disease...|$|R

40|$|Road {{networks}} in mountainous areas {{are particularly vulnerable}} following natural and man-made incidents since they are sparse and have {{a limited number of}} links and nodes. This weakness, or vulnerability, complicates the management of traffic flows in the event of emergencies, thus leading to problems of congestion and accessibility. The case of the international corridors along Alpine Valleys is significant since they serve both tourist and commercial routes, and have a typical tree-like structure that accommodates few roads dedicated to long-distance mobility and to local access. To manage emergencies and support the decision making process, local administrations and Civil Protection Agencies should use tools able to evaluate the effects of localized or widespread network failures or incidents in real-time, and limit the effects of reduced accessibility and/or differentiated traffic demand.

Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model of 20 eligible trials encompassing 1383 patients. The quality of studies was generally poor, such that 13 studies had greater than a 20 % loss to follow-up and only 3 trials reported adequate concealment of allocation. Use of neutral-pH dialysates with reduced GDPs resulted in larger urine volumes (7 trials; 520 patients; mean difference 126 ml/day, 95 % CI 27 - 226), improved residual renal function after 12 months (6 trials; 360 patients; standardized mean difference 0. 31, 95 % confidence interval 0. 10 - 0. 52), and a trend to reduced inflow pain (1 trial; 58 patients; relative risk 0. 51, 95 % CI 0. 24 - 1. 08).

Transport of AZT and the cofactor UDPGA across the human placenta and the glucuronidation capacity of the placenta for AZT were assessed using a human placental cell line (JEG- 3), primary cultures of villous term placenta, placental subcellular fractions, and a recirculating perfusion model. Glucuronidation of AZT was consistently observed at approximately 2 % of the dose administered. High levels of AZT in cultured primary placental cells and lines caused autoinhibition of AZT metabolism. AZT crossed the perfused placenta in a bidirectional fashion and was at equilibrium after 3 h, whereas the AZT-glucuronide metabolite was excreted preferentially into the maternal compartment. In contrast, UDPGA (10 μM) was rapidly transferred from the maternal to the fetal circulation, being complete after 4 h of perfusion. AZT is transported and glucuronidated by the human placenta, but that placental metabolism of the drug is not significant for whole-body <b>clearance.</b> Likewise therapeutic <b>failure</b> of AZT (5 - 15 %) is not due to placental obstruction of drug passage.

The treatment of gallbladder calculi has standardized {{in the form of}} laparoscopic cholecystectomy but management of CBD calculi is still evolving. Endoscopic removal of CBD calculi 2  cm in diameter high failure rates can be seen. Traditionally, laparoscopically one can achieve success rate comparable to endoscopic surgery but large and impacted calculi may cause failures. If one uses pneumatic lithotripsy during laparoscopic management of CBD calculi one can achieve 100 % stone clearance irrespective of size, degree of hardness and impaction. This study evaluates the feasibility of using pneumatic lithotripsy for CBD calculi. To our knowledge this is the 1 st reported series of using pneumatic lithotripsy for CBD calculi. Material and methodsFrom June 2002 to June 2010 96 laparoscopic CBD explorations (LCBDE) were done for CBD calculi. Patients having choledocholithiasis with CBD diameter of > 10  mm were taken for LCBDE while in patients with CBD diameter of < 10  mm were referred for endoscopic <b>clearance.</b> Additionally ERCP <b>failure</b> cases were also subjected to LCBDE. Rigid nephroscope was used for LCBDE and usually calculi were removed by forceps only. In patients having large, hard &/or impacted calculi pneumatic lithotripsy were used for fragmentation. ResultsOut of the 96 patients in 12 (12. 5 %) cases pneumatic lithotripsy was used for stone fragmentation. Out of these 12 cases 5 (41. 6 %) were ERCP failure cases. At a mean hospital stay of 2. 5 days 100 % stone clearance was achieved in all cases with no perioperative complication. ConclusionThe present study shows how successfully pneumatic lithotripsy can be used to fragment large, hard &/or impacted CBD calculi.

However, homozygosity for the B 2 m(null) allele also resulted {{in the absence of}} MHC class I expression, loss of NK cell activity, accumulation of iron in the liver, and rapid clearance of human IgG 1. NOD/LtSz-scid/scid B 2 m(null) mice supported markedly elevated levels of human T cell engraftment, compared with NOD/LtSz-scid/scid control animals, following injection with human PBMC. The increased engraftment was associated with a major {{increase in the number of}} human CD 4 + T cells. Following injection with 20 million human PBMC, levels of human CD 4 + T cells in the peripheral blood and spleen of NOD/ LtSz-scid/scid B 2 m(null) mice were 6 - to 7 -fold higher than those in NOD/LtSz-scid/scid mice and 3 ̆e 50 -fold higher than those in C.

The higher levels of human CD 4 + T cells and the normalization of the CD 4 :CD 8 ratio that are observed in human PBMC-engrafted NOD/LtSz-scid/scid B 2 m(null) mice suggest that this system may be an excellent model for studies of HIV pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Vancomycin is a {{glycopeptide}} antibiotic active against numerous gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The dosing regimens {{developed for}} vancomycin continue {{to result in}} high interpatient variability in serum drug concentrations. Variability in serum vancomycin concentrations is of concern for both efficacy and safety reasons. Therefore, it was desirable to describe the differences in vancomycin disposition, based on patient characteristics, to provide more accurate and precise predictions of observed serum concentrations. ^ Methods. Data pertaining to vancomycin were collected retrospectively from two tertiary clinical settings and analyzed using the population approach. A population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model was developed from these data. PPK model development included determination of a suitable compartmental model and subsequent incorporation of patient characteristics to describe differences in vancomycin disposition. A breakdown procedure was performed to ensure all model parameters were statistically significant at an α-level of at least 0. 005. The final PPK model underwent several validation checks, including cross-validation, posterior predictive check and objective function profiling. ^ Results. Data were collected from 129 patients, encompassing {{a wide range of}} characteristics, including age (16 – 94 years), weight (41 – 208 kg), serum creatinine (0. 4 – 6. 8 mg/dL), estimated creatinine clearance (6 – 300 mL/min), and disease states (33 congestive heart failure, 27 cancer and 10 chronic renal failure patients). A two-compartmental pharmacokinetic model was best-fitted to these data. Estimated creatinine <b>clearance,</b> chronic renal <b>failure,</b> patient age, and congestive heart failure were associated with total systemic clearance. The medical conditions cancer and congestive heart failure were found to increase the central volume of distribution. Hispanic patients displayed a significantly larger peripheral volume of distribution. Additionally, significant inter-occasion variability was noted in the estimated peripheral volumes of distribution. ^ Conclusion. The population approach, involving non-linear mixed effects modeling, was applied to the sparse concentration-time data obtained from routine clinical care records. Differences in observed concentrations between individuals were partially explained through associated differences between those individuals. Individualized dosing schedules may, therefore, be based on these observable differences prior to initial administration of vancomycin. ...|$|R
40|$|Undifferentiated febrile illness (UFI) {{includes}} typhoid and typhus fevers {{and generally}} designates fever without any localizing signs. UFI {{is a great}} therapeutic challenge in countries like Nepal {{because of the lack}} of available point-of-care, rapid diagnostic tests. Often patients are empirically treated as presumed enteric fever. Due to the development of high-level resistance to traditionally used fluoroquinolones against enteric fever, azithromycin is now commonly used to treat enteric fever/UFI. The re-emergence of susceptibility of Salmonella typhi to co-trimoxazole makes it a promising oral treatment for UFIs in general. We present a protocol of a randomized controlled trial of azithromycin versus co-trimoxazole for the treatment of UFI. This is a parallel-group, double-blind, 1 : 1, randomized controlled trial of co-trimoxazole versus azithromycin for the treatment of UFI in Nepal. Participants will be patients aged 2 to 65  years, presenting with fever without clear focus for at least 4  days, complying with other study criteria and willing to provide written informed consent. Patients will be randomized either to azithromycin 20  mg/kg/day (maximum 1000  mg/day) in a single daily dose and an identical placebo or co-trimoxazole 60  mg/kg/day (maximum 3000  mg/day) in two divided doses for 7  days. Patients will be followed up with twice-daily telephone calls for 7  days or for at least 48  h after they become afebrile, whichever is later; by home visits on days 2 and 4 of treatment; and by hospital visits on days 7, 14, 28 and 63. The endpoints will be fever <b>clearance</b> time, treatment <b>failure,</b> time to treatment failure, and adverse events. The estimated sample size is 330. The primary analysis population will be all the randomized population and subanalysis will be repeated on patients with blood culture-confirmed enteric fever and culture-negative patients. Both azithromycin and co-trimoxazole are available in Nepal and are extensively used in the treatment of UFI. Therefore, it is important to know the better orally administered antimicrobial to treat enteric fever and other UFIs especially against the background of fluoroquinolone-resistant enteric fever.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesIn {{the present}} study, we {{describe}} the characteristics and examine the anticoagulation levels and safety of subcutaneous enoxaparin in unstable angina (UA) /non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients who {{would not have been}} eligible in the Efficacy Safety Subcutaneous Enoxaparin in Non–Q-wave Coronary Events (ESSENCE) and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) - 11 B trials. BackgroundIt is not known whether the benefit shown with enoxaparin in the selected population of pivotal trials can be extended to the real world. MethodsIn our center, all patients with UA/NSTEMI are anticoagulated with subcutaneous enoxaparin adjusted to creatinine clearance. Among 515 consecutive patients, we identified 174 who would not have been eligible for ESSENCE or TIMI- 11 B (“EP” group for excluded patients). We evaluated cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), as well as major and minor bleeding events, at 30 days in the EP group and in patients without any of the exclusion criteria (“NEP” group for non-excluded patients). ResultsThis EP group was older, had a higher female/male ratio, and more frequently had a history of MI or a diagnosis of non-Q MI on admission than the NEP group. The distribution of the anti-Xa activity was similar in both groups. The bleeding rates (major and minor) at 30 days were similar in the EP and NEP groups (2. 3 % vs. 2. 9 %, respectively, p = NS). On multivariate analysis, the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and the presence of hypertension were the only independent predictors of bleeding found in the whole population. Compared with the NEP group, the EP group had a fourfold increased rate of death or MI at 30 days (15. 5 % vs. 4. 1 %, p < 0. 01). On multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of death or MI at 30 days were NSTEMI on admission, creatinine <b>clearance,</b> and heart <b>failure.</b> ConclusionsPatients who do not fit the enrollment criteria of ESSENCE/TIMI- 11 B have higher risk baseline characteristics for both bleeding and ischemic events. In these patients, enoxaparin with dose adjustment to creatinine clearance provides adequate anti-Xa levels and no excess of bleeding...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of carbon-fibre reinforced plastics in loadbearing automotive structures provides a great potential toreduce vehicle weight and fuel consumption. To enable themanufacture and assembly of composite structural parts,reliable and cost-effective joining technologies must bedeveloped. This thesis addresses {{several aspects of}} joining andload introduction in carbon-fibre reinforced plastics based onnon-crimp fabric reinforcement. The bearing strength of carbon fibre/epoxy laminates wasinvestigated considering the effects of bolt-hole <b>clearance.</b> The laminate <b>failure</b> modes and ultimate bearing strength werefound to be significantly dependent upon the laminate stackingsequence, geometry and lateral clamping load. Significantreduction in bearing strength at 4 % hole deformation was foundfor both pin-loaded and clamped laminates. The ultimatestrength of the joints {{was found to be}} independent of theinitial bolt-hole clearance. The behaviour of hybrid (bolted/bonded) joints wasinvestigated both numerically and experimentally. Athree-dimensional non-linear finite element model was developedto predict the load transfer distribution in the joints. Theeffect of the joint geometry and adhesive material propertieson the load transfer was determined through a parameter study. An experimental investigation was undertaken to determine thestrength, failure mechanisms and fatigue life of hybrid joints. The joints were shown to have greater strength, stiffness andfatigue life in comparison to adhesive bonded joints. However,the benefits were only observed in joint designs which allowedfor load sharing between the adhesive and the bolt. The effect of the environment on the durability of bondedand hybrid joints was investigated. The strength and fatiguelife of the joints was found to decrease significantly withincreased ageing time. Hybrid joints demonstrated increasedfatigue life in comparison to adhesive bonded joints afterageing in a cyclic freeze/thaw environment. The strength and failure mechanisms of composite laminatessubject to localised transverse loading were investigatedconsidering the effect of the specimen size, stacking sequenceand material system. Damage was found to initiate in thelaminates at low load levels, typically 20 - 30 % of the ultimatefailure load. The dominant initial failure mode wasintralaminar shear failure, which occurred in sub-surfaceplies. Two different macromechanical failure modes wereidentified, fastener pull-through failure and global collapseof the laminate. The damage patterns and ultimate failure modewere found to depend upon the laminate stacking sequence andresin system. Finite element analysis was used to analyse thestress distribution within the laminates and predict first-plyfailure.
