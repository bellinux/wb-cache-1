5|$|The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is an {{international}} financial institution that offers loans to middle-income developing countries. The IBRD {{is the first of}} five member institutions that compose the World Bank Group and is headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States. It was established in 1944 with the mission of financing the reconstruction of European nations devastated by World War II. The IBRD and its <b>concessional</b> lending arm, the International Development Association, are collectively known as the World Bank as they share the same leadership and staff. Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate expanded to advancing worldwide economic development and eradicating poverty. The IBRD provides commercial-grade or <b>concessional</b> financing to sovereign states to fund projects that seek to improve transportation and infrastructure, education, domestic policy, environmental consciousness, energy investments, healthcare, access to food and potable water, and access to improved sanitation.|$|E
5|$|The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) were {{established}} by delegates at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 and became operational in 1946. The IBRD was established {{with the original}} mission of financing the reconstruction efforts of war-torn European nations following World War II, with goals shared by the later Marshall Plan. The Bank issued its inaugural loan of $250 million ($2.6 billion in 2012 dollars) to France in 1947 to finance infrastructure projects. The institution also established its first field offices in Paris, France, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Prague in the former Czechoslovakia. Throughout {{the remainder of the}} 1940s and 1950s, the Bank financed projects seeking to dam rivers, generate electricity, and improve access to water and sanitation. It also invested in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg's steel industry. Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate has transitioned to eradicating poverty around the world. In 1960, the International Development Association (IDA) was established to serve as the Bank's <b>concessional</b> lending arm and provide low and no-cost finance and grants to the poorest of the developing countries as measured by gross national income per capita.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} component of the Bretton Woods agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Collectively referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. The IMF was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory and technical assistance to members, and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium. Members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of gross world product, from which emergency loans could be issued. Member states were authorized and encouraged to employ capital controls as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on IMF financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages. While the IMF was instituted to guide members and provide a short-term financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the IBRD was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects. The creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone {{in the evolution of the}} international financial architecture, and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following World War II. Since the establishment of the International Development Association (IDA) in 1960, the IBRD and IDA are together known as the World Bank. While the IBRD lends to middle-income developing countries, the IDA extends the Bank's lending program by offering <b>concessional</b> loans and grants to the world's poorest nations.|$|E

25|$|Financing {{conditions}} differ between {{urban and}} rural areas. In {{the case of the}} NWSC, <b>concessional</b> debt contracted from international financial institutions had been passed on by the government to the utility in the form of debt. In February 2008, however, the government agreed to convert the NWSC's USH:153.5 billion debt into equity. This was done to increase the NWSC's ability to borrow from the local capital market. A week later, the NWSC announced that it intended to borrow USH:30 billion more on the bond market to finance mitigation of the impact of Lake Victoria's receding levels on water supply. The NWSC expected to be able to borrow in local currency at lower interest rates and for longer maturities compared to borrowing from commercial banks. The World Bank assisted in structuring the bond issue. The Ugandan Ministry of Finance, however, stopped the bond issue from going ahead, citing the need to first use conventional <b>concessional</b> financing sources.|$|E

Passengers who wish to change {{direction}} or transit to other corridors {{do not need to}} pay again, provided they do not exit the shelter. An exception is in effect at the line terminus.|$|E
25|$|The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami saw the {{creation}} of the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development, which was launched in early 2005 with A$1 billion of funding to assist with the rebuilding of communities in Aceh and other disaster-affected areas, and to promote economic growth across Indonesia. Combined with the pre-existing Australia-to-Indonesia program, it boosted the value of Australia-to-Indonesia aid between 2005–2010 to $2 billion, including A$500 million in <b>concessional</b> loans.|$|E
25|$|Official {{development}} assistance (ODA) {{is a term}} coined by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to measure aid. ODA refers to aid from national governments for promoting economic development and welfare in low and middle income countries. ODA can be bilateral or multilateral. This aid is given as either grants, where no repayment is required, or as <b>concessional</b> loans, where interest rates are lower than market rates.|$|E

Low-rate loans and associations with skilled Chinese building companies are guided towards building or rebuilding local infrastructure, equipment, and offshore stations which meet a dual Chinese and African interest. EximBank can provide loans for roads, railroads, electric and telecommunication systems, pipelines, hospitals and various other needed facilities. It is the sole lending bank for Chinese Government <b>Concessional</b> Loans entrusted by the Chinese Government.|$|E

St Peter's lost a small section of land on its south west extremity for the motorway on-ramp at Khyber Pass Rd {{and in return}} was sold Reeves Road and some prison houses at a <b>concessional</b> price. Reeves Rd disappeared as a street {{and much of the}} subsequent expansion of the school has taken place on its site. However, both Auckland Grammar and St Peter's have had to endure the adjacent motorway since 1965.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the IMF negotiates {{conditions}} on lending and loans under their policy of conditionality, {{which was established}} in the 1950s. Low-income countries can borrow on <b>concessional</b> terms, which means there is a period of time with no interest rates, through the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), the Standby Credit Facility (SCF) and the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF). Nonconcessional loans, which include interest rates, are provided mainly through Stand-By Arrangements (SBA), the Flexible Credit Line (FCL), the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), and the Extended Fund Facility. The IMF provides emergency assistance via the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to members facing urgent balance-of-payments needs.|$|E
25|$|India's {{reliance}} on external assistance and <b>concessional</b> debt has decreased since liberalisation of the economy, and the debt service ratio decreased from 35.3% in 1990–91 to 4.4% in 2008–09. In India, external commercial borrowings (ECBs), or commercial loans from non-resident lenders, are being permitted {{by the government}} for providing an additional source of funds to Indian corporates. The Ministry of Finance monitors and regulates them through ECB policy guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Foreign Exchange Management Act of 1999. India's foreign exchange reserves have steadily risen from $5.8billion in March 1991 to $318.6billion in December 2009. In 2012, the United Kingdom announced an end to all financial aid to India, citing the growth and robustness of Indian economy.|$|E
25|$|Norway Post {{took the}} {{initiative}} to start an airline service from Bergen via Trondheim to Tromsø, which would allow a letter to travel between Bergen and Tromsø in two days, rather than eight. Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) received a <b>concessional</b> monopoly on all scheduled air services in Norway from 1935, and the postal service contracted DNL to operate a route to Northern Norway. Several places were considered, such as Skansen, which was located in the city center on the Trondheimsfjord. However, DNL considered that the fjord was not sufficiently protected against the elements, had too large waves and too much ship traffic. The airline therefore chose a site at Valsen {{on the shore of}} Jonsvatnet. The decision was made only days before the maiden flight.|$|E
25|$|After {{the opening}} of the airport, Widerøe also applied to operate the route. At the time, the {{ministry}} would select one company who would be granted a <b>concessional</b> monopoly on the route. The concession was granted to Coast Aero Center, which was permitted to operate to Bergen and Stavanger. The ministry stated that Fonnafly was not fully operational while Norving had stated that they could not make money without flying to Oslo. The reason the route to Oslo was dropped, was that there was insufficient capacity at Fornebu. After being rewarded the concession, Coast Aero Center started plans to build a hangar at Sørstokken. The route was set up to leave Stavanger in the morning and fly via Sørstokken to Bergen and then back; this was repeated in the afternoon and then a single round trip was flown from Stavanger to Sørstokken after the last evening plan from Oslo had landed in Stavanger.|$|E
25|$|The Daintree River Ferry is a cable ferry {{across the}} Daintree River in Cape Tribulation. The ferry {{is the only}} cable ferry {{operating}} within tropical Australia and its daily hours of operation are between 06:00 and midnight. In July 2003, the Shire of Douglas overturned a motion to investigate {{the construction of a}} low-lying single lane bridge with a boom gate and a second ferry across the Daintree. Residents feared a bridge would threaten the rainforest due to a potential increase in traffic. Where as tourist operators stated a bridge would have boosted the local economy. Over the 2011 Easter long weekend, during a period when the ferry was free, tourists using the ferry dramatically increased and resorts were booked out. After Easter local tourism operators expressed a desire for the ferry to be free year-round but their suggestion was ignored. As of 1 July 2011, the cost of a return ticket for private use motor cars and utilities was $22. Limited annual quantities of Daintree ferry <b>concessional</b> travel policy applies to the following people: Cairns Regional Council ratepayers, residents, business operators and employees who work north of the Daintree River and are within the former Douglas Shire area; Queensland Health or Blue Care who travel across the Daintree Ferry {{in the course of their}} duties; and Residents of the Wujal Wujal Aboriginal Shire and some Cook Shire Council residents.|$|E

2500|$|The Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development defines its aid measure, Official Development Assistance (ODA), as follows: [...] "ODA {{consists}} of flows {{to developing countries}} and multilateral institutions provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies, each transaction of which meets the following test: a) it is administered with {{the promotion of the}} economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective, and b) it is <b>concessional</b> in character and contains a grant element of at least 25% (calculated at a rate of discount of 10%)." [...] (OECD, The DAC in Dates, 2006. Section, [...] "1972".) Foreign aid has increased since 1950's and 1960's (Isse 129). The notion that foreign aid increases economic performance and generates economic growth is based on Chenery and Strout's Dual Gap Model(Isse 129). Chenerya and Strout (1966) claimed that foreign aid promotes development by adding to domestic savings as well as to foreign exchange availability, this helping to close either the savings-investment gap or the export-import gap. (Isse 129).|$|E
2500|$|Financing. Tanzania {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{recipient}} countries of foreign aid in Sub-Saharan Africa. This includes assistance in the form of grants, <b>concessional</b> loans and debt relief. Aid management in Tanzania is guided by the Joint Assistance Strategy (JAST) approved in 2006 and aimed at implementing the principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. JAST advocates the integration of all development funds into the government budget, fosters national ownership and promotes a [...] "division of labour" [...] between donors. The Public Expenditure Report however suggests that not all spending in the water sector is included in the government budget. A comparison between OECD and Ministry of Finance data on bilateral aid shows that there is a gap between the two sources. This indicates that there has been off-budget financing of about 26% of total bilateral aid in the past five years. According to data published by MoWI, of the funds budgeted for the water and sanitation sector for fiscal year 2009-2010, about 88% will be provided from foreign transfers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, Archbishop Liston {{purchased}} [...] on Mountain Road {{opposite the}} school. This land {{was owned by}} New Zealand Breweries and {{had been part of}} the Great Northern Brewery, later called Lion Brewery, which stretched from Khyber Pass along Mountain Rd up as far as Seccombes Rd. Part of the land purchased had been used as tennis courts for the staff. The land became available because, from 1950, New Zealand Breweries was concentrating its beer production at the Captain Cook Brewery further down Khyber Pass towards Newmarket. The Lion Brewery site was therefore sold off, part to the New Zealand Distillary Company and part, which included the tennis courts, to the Bishop of Auckland for St Peter's College. The site was purchased from New Zealand Breweries for £11,000 per acre, a <b>concessional</b> price. The sum was paid by the parents of the school through fairs, raffles and money contributions. Students were involved in picking up stones and glass from the field, sometimes as a detention. The site was used as a rugby field (at first called [...] "the Far Field" [...] or [...] "the New Field" [...] and now, [...] "the Cage"). Located on it is a sports' pavilion called the Brother P. C. Ryan Sports Pavilion. It is named for Brother PC [...] "Paddy" [...] Ryan, the headmaster at the time, who managed the purchase and transformation of the site. The pavilion replaced an earlier pavilion opened in 1960 (see below). In 2012 the Cage was refurbished into an Astro turf field capable of playing rugby and soccer in all weathers and conditions.|$|E
