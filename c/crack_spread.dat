50|$|Various {{financial}} intermediaries in the commodity markets have tailored {{their products to}} facilitate trading crack spreads. For example, NYMEX offers virtual <b>crack</b> <b>spread</b> futures contracts by treating a basket of underlying NYMEX futures contracts corresponding to a <b>crack</b> <b>spread</b> as a single transaction. Treating <b>crack</b> <b>spread</b> futures baskets as a single transaction {{has the advantage of}} reducing the margin requirements for a <b>crack</b> <b>spread</b> futures position. Other market participants dealing over the counter provide even more customized products.|$|E
5000|$|For simplicity, most {{refiners}} {{wishing to}} hedge their price exposures {{have used a}} crack ratio usually expressed as X:Y:Z where X represents a number of barrels of crude oil, Y represents a number of barrels of gasoline and Z represents a number of barrels of distillate fuel oil, subject to the constraint that X=Y+Z. This crack ratio is used for hedging purposes by buying X barrels of crude oil and selling Y barrels of gasoline and Z barrels of distillate in the futures market. The <b>crack</b> <b>spread</b> X:Y:Z reflects the spread obtained by trading oil, gasoline and distillate according to this ratio. Widely used crack spreads have included 3:2:1, 5:3:2 and 2:1:1. As the 3:2:1 <b>crack</b> <b>spread</b> {{is the most popular}} of these, widely quoted <b>crack</b> <b>spread</b> benchmarks are the [...] "Gulf Coast 3:2:1" [...] and the [...] "Chicago 3:2:1".|$|E

50|$|Refiners’ {{profits are}} tied {{directly}} to the spread, or difference, between {{the price of crude}} oil and the prices of refined products. Because refiners can reliably predict their costs other than crude oil, the spread is their major uncertainty. One way in which a refiner could ensure a given spread would be to buy crude oil futures and sell product futures. Another would be to buy crude oil call options and sell product call options. Both of those strategies are complex, however, and they require the hedger to tie up funds in margin accounts.To ease this burden, NYMEX in 1994 launched the <b>crack</b> <b>spread</b> contract. NYMEX treats <b>crack</b> <b>spread</b> purchases or sales of multiple futures as a single trade for the purposes of establishing margin requirements. The <b>crack</b> <b>spread</b> contract helps refiners to lock-in a crude oil price and heating oil and unleaded gasoline prices simultaneously in order to establish a fixed refining margin. One type of <b>crack</b> <b>spread</b> contract bundles the purchase of three crude oil futures (30,000 barrels) with the sale a month later of two unleaded gasoline futures (20,000 barrels) and one heating oil future (10,000 barrels). The 3-2-1 ratio approximates the real-world ratio of refinery output—2 barrels of unleaded gasoline and 1 barrel of heating oil from 3 barrels of crude oil. Buyers and sellers concern themselves only with the margin requirements for the <b>crack</b> <b>spread</b> contract. They do not deal with individual margins for the underlying trades.An average 3-2-1 ratio based on sweet crude is not appropriate for all refiners, however, and the OTC market provides contracts that better reflect the situation of individual refineries. Some refineries specialize in heavy crude oils, while others specialize in gasoline. One thing OTC traders can attempt is to aggregate individual refineries so that the trader’s portfolio is close to the exchange ratios. Traders can also devise swaps that are based on the differences between their clients’ situations and the exchange standards.|$|E

50|$|Naturally forming mudcracks {{start as}} wet, muddy {{sediment}} desiccates, causing contraction.

5000|$|<b>Crack</b> <b>spread</b> is a {{term used}} on the oil {{industry}} and futures trading for the differential between {{the price of crude}} oil and petroleum products extracted from it.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} basic exposures of two Al and Mg alloys behaviour {{changes during}} the {{high cycle fatigue}} loading, which were detected using acoustic emission (AE) method and analysis of load frequency changes of the electromagnetic loading device. The electro-resonance fatigue test machine works with loading frequency corresponding with resonance of the whole loading system. In case that the rigidity of the tested sample is changed (cyclic hardening or softening in the initial part of loading, fatigue crack initiation and <b>crack</b> <b>spreading</b> etc.) this frequency is changed. It means {{that it is possible}} to estimate approximately the length of these stages. From practical point of view the most important is the identification of the fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>spreading</b> phase of course, but in case of detailed analysis some changes of frequency can be detected in the stage of “stable ” mode. Much more detailed information about changes of mechanism of cyclic damage is provided by AE method application, which identifies plenty of damage mechanisms.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors affecting the <b>crack</b> <b>spread</b> is the relative proportion of various petroleum products produced by a refinery.

To some degree, the proportion of each product produced can be varied in order to suit the demands of the local market. Regional differences in the demand for each refined product depend upon the relative demand for fuel for heating, cooking or transportation purposes. Within a region, there can also be seasonal differences in demand for heating fuel versus transportation fuel.|$|E

40|$|On {{the heels}} of steep {{refinery}} rationalisation in the Atlantic Basin, 2012 was a year of significant rebound for Europe’s ailing refining sector.
