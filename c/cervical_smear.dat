40|$|Abstract Background The female lower {{genital tract}} is a gateway for {{pathogens}} entering the host through the mucous membrane. One of the prevalent human viruses is Torque teno virus (TTV). The major reported routes of TTV transmission are fecal-oral and parenteral. Furthermore, other modes of transmission, e. g. sexual contact, are suggested. To investigate the sexual route of TTV transmission, <b>cervical</b> <b>smears</b> of healthy women {{and those with}} cervical lesions were screened {{for the presence of}} TTV DNA. Methods TTV DNA was studied in <b>cervical</b> <b>smears</b> of 95 patients with cervical lesions and 55 healthy women. Paired serum samples were available from 55 and 42 women, respectively. All healthy women had normal cytology while 44 patients had histologically confirmed low-grade lesion (LGL) and 51 high-grade lesion (HGL). TTV DNA was detected with primers specific for the non-coding region. In 40 paired <b>cervical</b> <b>smears</b> and serum samples, the phylogenetic group of TTV isolates was determined. The presence of HPV DNA in <b>cervical</b> <b>smears</b> was detected by means of PCR with MY 09 / 11 primers. Results The prevalence of TTV DNA in <b>cervical</b> <b>smears</b> of healthy women was 52. 7 % and was comparable with that in paired serum samples (50 %). Symptomatic women had significantly higher prevalence of TTV DNA in <b>cervical</b> <b>smears</b> (74. 7 %) than healthy controls. The TTV DNA prevalence in patient serum samples was 51 %. The phylogenetic groups of TTV serum isolates were concordant with those of TTV from <b>cervical</b> <b>smears</b> of the same subjects. In <b>cervical</b> <b>smears,</b> a wider variety of TTV isolates was found. The viral loads in <b>cervical</b> <b>smears</b> were 10 to 1000 times as high as in sera. The HPV-positive study subjects had significantly higher TTV DNA prevalence than HPV negatives. The prevalence of TTV was not associated with disease severity. Conclusion High prevalence of TTV in <b>cervical</b> <b>smears</b> suggests that sexual transmission is another mode of expansion of TTV infection among the population. The higher viral load in <b>cervical</b> <b>smears</b> than in the respective serum samples might indicate active TTV replication in the female genital tract. Nevertheless, cooperation between TTV and HPV needs to be further investigated. </p...|$|R

METHODS [...] One hundred and ten <b>cervical</b> <b>smears</b> were circulated to 10 observers from five district general hospital histopathology departments and five major departments of cytopathology. Their responses were analysed by five consultant general histopathologists and five consultant specialist cytopathologists. In 54 of the 110 cases, the histology of a corresponding cervical biopsy specimen was compared with the smear assessments. RESULTS [...] Specialist cytopathologists were more consistent than non-specialists when diagnosing and grading dyskaryosis. They chose the higher grades of dyskaryosis more frequently than the non-specialists. The cytopathologists recommended referral for colposcopy more frequently, but if they asked for a repeat smear, they wanted it done within three months more frequently than the histopathologists. The specialists were more frequently {{in agreement with the}} biopsy grade of intra-epithelial neoplasia than the non-specialists, whose smear diagnoses tended to underestimate the severity of the histopathological abnormality. CONCLUSIONS [...] This study has shown major differences between specialist and non-specialist cytopathologists in the diagnosis and grading of <b>cervical</b> <b>smears</b> and in the recommended management of patients with abnormal smears. These differences may result in uneven clinical management of women with smear abnormalities.

METHODS: The methodology was established using cultured cells and routine <b>cervical</b> <b>smears</b> hybridised with digoxigenin labelled probes for HPV, 16, 18, 31, and 33. The technique {{was applied to the}} analysis of 53 patients from a sexually transmitted disease clinic. RESULTS: The optimal sensitivity achieved for single HPV detection in cultured cells was 1 - 2 copies of HPV 16 per cell and that for detection of a cocktail of HPV types in routine <b>cervical</b> <b>smears</b> was 2. 5 - 12 copies per cell. Of parallel smears taken from patients with a normal Papinacolau-stained smear 33. 3 % (24) contained a HPV 16, 18, 31, and 33 signal indicating an occult HPV infection. The prevalence of these HPV types was similar in women in whom a cytopathological diagnosis of wart virus infection was made (64. 7 %, 17) and in patients with mild dyskaryosis (75 %, 12). CONCLUSIONS: The methodology evolved localises HPV sequences directly to epithelial cell nuclei, which can be morphologically assessed by haematoxylin counterstaining. Sample contamination with exogenous viral sequences can be distinguished from true infection. In this study, a HPV signal was not found in morphologically normal epithelial cells. The methods described will permit the detection of HPV sequences in routinely collected <b>cervical</b> <b>smears</b> and the evaluation of the natural history and potential clinical relevance of HPV infection without changes in clinical practice...|$|R

The results of the LLETZ cone biopsy revealed an active granulomatous cervicitis.|$|E

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} {{opportunistic}} screening in primary care, {{in such a}} way that would include teenage women. Setting: screening for chlamydia infection was offered opportunistically in eight general practices in Edinburgh to women aged ? 35 years attending for <b>cervical</b> <b>smear,</b> and women aged ? 20 years attending for contraception. The numbers of women eligible to be offered screening were 901 in the <b>cervical</b> <b>smear</b> group, and 595 in the contraception group. Results: effective screening rate (offered test, consented, and urine sample returned) was 30 % for the <b>cervical</b> <b>smear</b> group compared with 23 % for the contraception group. Among those tested, chlamydia prevalence was strongly associated with young age, ranging from 11. 8 % in those 25 years. Number of sexual partners in past year did not improve prediction of infection. Conclusion: these findings raise concerns regarding the feasibility of opportunistic screening in general practice, particularly for those with highest prevalence of chlamydia—teenage wome...|$|E
30|$|Vaginal septae {{could become}} a source of vaginal dystocia or {{lacerations}} [8, 9]. Since it was excised, it prevented these potential obstetric complications. Excision of the septae may reduce the technical difficulty in taking <b>cervical</b> <b>smears</b> and general anaesthesia may not be required for cervical screening in the future.|$|R
40|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) self-sampling (self-HPV) {{is valuable}} in cervical cancer screening. HPV testing is usually performed on physician-collected <b>cervical</b> <b>smears</b> stored in liquid-based medium. Dry filters and swabs are an alternative. We evaluated {{the adequacy of}} self-HPV using two dry storage and transport devices, the FTA cartridge and swab...|$|R
40|$|The sensitivities of {{dot blot}} {{hybridisation}} and in situ filter hybridisation {{for the detection}} of HPV DNA were compared. Dot blot hybridisation was 10 - 50 times more sensitive than in situ filter hybridisation in detecting HPV 16 DNA in the cervical cancer cell lines SiHa and CaSki. <b>Cervical</b> <b>smears</b> collected from 51 women with a history of one or more abnormal <b>cervical</b> <b>smears</b> were tested by both hybridisation techniques for the presence of HPV 16 DNA; 11 were positive in the in situ filter hybridisation, 35 in the dot blot hybridisation. Thirty-five cervical biopsies available from this group of 51 women were processed for dot blot hybridisation. In 30 of the 35 cases the results of this hybridisation corresponded with the results of the dot blot hybridisation on the smear...|$|R
