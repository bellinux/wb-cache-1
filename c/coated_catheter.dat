The plants extractions were done with methanol under cold extraction. The various concentrations 5. 0, 10. 0 and 20. 0 mg/mL were used to coat 63 catheters under mild heat from water bath. Biofilm formation on the catheter was induced using cultures of E. coli. Biofilm formation was evaluated using aerobic plate count and turbidity at 600 nm. From the obtained results, Psidium guajava, Mangifera indica and Ocimum gratissimum delayed the onset of biofilm formation for a week. Ocimum gratissimum <b>coated</b> <b>catheter</b> had the highest inhibitory effect at 5. 0, 10. 0 and 20. 0 mg/mL with bacterial count ranging from 2. 2 × 105 - 7. 0 × 104 and 5. 7 × 105 - 3. 7 × 105 for 120 and 128 hrs respectively. The Psidium guajava <b>coated</b> <b>catheter</b> had the lowest inhibitory effect at 5. 0, 10. 0 and 20. 0 mg/mL, with bacterial count ranging between 4. 3 × 105 - 1. 9 × 103 and 7. 7 × 105 - 3. 8 × 105 for 120 and 128 hrs respectively.

In the present study biofilm forming bacteria P. mirabilis was chosen for SEM study. The microbe was allowed to form a biofilm matrix in a sample piece of catheter tube with a coating of silver nanoparticles. The nature of biofilm formed on the catheter with and without silver nanoparticles coating was tested.

In the study that is described, the comparative efficacies of vancomycin, clindamycin, novobiocin, and minocycline, alone or in combination with rifampin, were tested in an in vitro model of colonization. The model consisted of the modified Robbins device with antibiotic-impregnated cement filling the lumen of catheter segments. The synergistic combination of minocycline and rifampin was the most efficacious in preventing bacterial colonization of slime-producing strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus to catheter surfaces. A similar trend was observed when the inhibitory activities of polyurethane <b>catheters</b> <b>coated</b> with minocycline and rifampin were compared with the inhibitory activities of <b>catheters</b> <b>coated</b> with other antimicrobial agents.

These problems are usually related to the handling of the staff, the catheter materials, and the surface properties of the catheter.

50|$|A {{major problem}} with Foley {{catheters}} {{is that they}} tend to contribute to urinary tract infections (UTI). This occurs because bacteria can travel up the catheter to the bladder, where the urine can become infected. To combat this, the industry is moving to antiseptic <b>coated</b> <b>catheters.</b> This has been helpful, but has not completely solved this major problem. An additional problem is that Foley catheters tend to become coated over time with a biofilm that can obstruct the drainage. This increases the amount of stagnant urine left in the bladder, which further contributes to the problem of urinary tract infections. When a Foley catheter becomes clogged, it must be flushed or replaced.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{hydrophilic}} polymer {{surface with}} low friction has been devel-oped. A coating can be attached by {{the reaction of}} an epoxy containing poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) with the polyamino compound formed {{on the surface of}} the substrate. The epoxy containing poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) was obtained by the copolymerization of vinyl pyrrolidone, glycidyl acrylate, and vinyl acetate. A molecular weight of 400, 000 or more is essential to achieve low surface friction. Polyurethane catheters in rabbit models, both with and without the hydro-philic low friction coating, were evaluated for surface friction coefficient and blood compatibility.

40|$|Objectives: To {{test the}} {{antimicrobial}} activity {{and evaluate the}} risk of systemic toxicity of novel <b>catheters</b> <b>coated</b> with silver nanoparticles. Methods: <b>Catheters</b> were <b>coated</b> with silver using AgNO 3, a surfactant and N,N,N 0,N 0 -tetramethylethy-lenediamine as a reducing agent. Particle size was determined by electron microscopy. Silver release from the catheters was determined in vitro and in vivo using radioactive silver (110 mAg 1). Activity on microbial growth and biofilm formation was evaluated against pathogens most commonly involved in catheter-related infections, and the risk for systemic toxicity was estimated by measuring silver biodis-tribution in mice implanted subcutaneously with 110 mAg 1 -coated <b>catheters.</b> Results: The <b>coating</b> method yielded a thin (100 nm) layer of nanoparticles of silver {{on the surface of}} the catheters. Variations in AgNO 3 concentration translated into proportional changes in silver coating (from 0. 1 to 30 mg/cm 2). Sustained release of silver was demonstrated over a period of 10 days. <b>Coated</b> <b>catheters</b> showed significant in vitro antimicrobial activity and prevented biofilm formation using Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Approximately 15 % of the coated silver eluted from the catheters in 10 days in vivo, with predominant excretion in faeces (8 %), accumulation at the implan-tation site (3 %) and no organ accumulation (0. 1 %). Conclusions: A method to <b>coat</b> plastic <b>catheters</b> with bioactive silver nanoparticles was developed. These catheters are non-toxic and are capable of targeted and sustained release of silver at the implan-tation site.

40|$|Objective: Catheter-associated {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (CAUTI) {{is the most common}} healthcare-associated infection. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the use of a silicone catheter coated with an ultrathin layer of a combination of the noble metals gold, palladium and silver (BIP™–silicone catheter) could reduce the incidence of CAUTI and antibiotic prescription compared with a standard silicone catheter in a cohort of acute neurological patients suffering primarily from stroke. At the same time, all infectious events requiring prescription of an antimicrobial agent were registered and are reported. Materials and methods: The study was designed as a crossover cohort study enrolling men and women aged over 18 years, requiring emergency management for stroke including the insertion of an indwelling catheter. Data on patient characteristics, {{urinary tract infection}}s (UTIs), other infectious events and all antibiotic prescriptions were recorded prospectively. Results: The patients’ characteristics differed in the two centres in terms of age but not in diagnosis distribution. UTIs were recorded in 78 (24. 2 %) of the patients, ahead of pulmonary tract infections (n = 65; 20. 2 %). There was no difference in terms of CAUTI in the two catheter groups, even in subgroups with catheter treatment for 1 week or less. The patients with a diagnosed UTI required 3. 5 more days of hospitalization than those without a UTI. Conclusion: CAUTIs were the most frequent healthcare-associated infections, slightly ahead of pulmonary tract infections.

40|$|Introduction: During adrenal venous {{sampling}} (AVS) procedure, radiologists administer {{a contrast}} agent via the catheter {{to visualize the}} proper catheter position. Materials and methods: A patient with primary aldosteronism diagnostic-hypothesis was admitted for AVS. A venogram was performed to confirm the catheter’s position with 2 mL of Iopamidol 300 mg/mL. Samples were collected with syringe connected to a hydrophilic <b>coated</b> <b>catheter</b> by low-pressure aspiration {{from each of the}} four collection sites: inferior vena cava in the suprarenal portion, inferior vena cava in the infrarenal portion, left adrenal vein, and right adrenal vein; then immediately transferred from syringe to tubes with gel separator. All tubes were centrifuged at 1200 x g for 10 minutes. Results: At the end of centrifugation process, primary blood tubes containing blood from inferior vena cava and left adrenal vein exhibited the standard gel separator barrier, while tubes from right adrenal vein showed abnormal flotation of gel separator. The radiologist confirmed the usage of 2. 6 mL instead of 2. 0 mL of Iopamidol 300 mg/mL. This iodinated contrast media, with 1. 33 g/cm 3 of density, was used close to the right adrenal vein due to some difficulty to access it. Conclusion: The abnormal flotation of gel separator in samples taken from right adrenal vein {{can be explained by the}} usage of the iodinated contrast media. We suggest using plain-tubes (without gel separator) for AVS in order to avoid preanalytical nonconformities. Moreover, a blood volume equivalent to twice the catheter extension should be discarded to eliminate residual contrast media before collection of samples for laboratory assays...|$|E
40|$|Biomaterial {{associated}} infection (BAI) is {{a common}} and serious complication in permanent implant situations or other long-term tissue-biomaterial interactions. Established infections are frequently persistent and hard to fight with current antimicrobial approaches. Formation of bacerial biofilm on the biomaterial surface is generally considered the key factor but recent studies have come to question the strong focus on surface adhered bacteria. It is suggested that bacterial colonization of tissue surrounding the device may have more importance to the persistent nature of BAI. Patients with percutaneous medical devices (e. g external fixators and intravascular catheters) are extra sensitive to BAI. It is also well recognized that biomaterial presence itself reduces immune system efficiency. As a consequence {{there is a need}} for more research on the role of infections related to percutaneous medical devices and other BAI. This requires relevant infection models for in vitro studies to reduce the distance to animal models when testing novel antimicrobial modifications of biomaterials. However, there seems to be a lack of in vitro infection models that simulate the condition of the soft tissue surrounding percutaneous medical devices and other biomaterials. This master thesis describes an early phase development of a novel in vitro model simulating a soft tissue infection related to percutaneous medical devices. This model makes it possible to analyze bacterial colonization of both the biomaterial and the surrounding medium mimicking soft tissue extra cellular matrix. The model comprises a collagen matrix in which a contaminated model biomaterial is incubated. Segments of silver-coated and non-coated silicon urinary catheters were used as model biomaterials. In order to mimic a contamination during a surgical prcedure, the catheter segments were submerged for a short time in diluted bacteria culture before insertion in the collagen matrix. This study included the bacterial Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bacterial quantification was performed primarily with plate count method. Even small concentrations of the inoculation solution (10 3 cells /mL) resulted in bacterial growth on both the model biomaterial and in the surrounding collagen matrix. No significant antimicrobial effect was observed for the silver coating although a tendency to lower amount of bacteria was found on the <b>coated</b> <b>catheter.</b> In the surrounding media bacterial growth was similar for both materials. More work is of course needed to develop such in vitro infection model related to percutaneous medical devices. With a model which does not discard any bacteria during the experimental steps it is possible to observe where the bacteria are located and to which amount, both on the biomaterial and in the surrounding medium. It is likely that this in vitro model better mimic the challenges for such material in the clinical situation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} triple-lumen central venous <b>catheters</b> <b>coated</b> with a combination product of chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine (CSS) in reducing the incidence of local catheter infection and catheter-related bacteremia. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: The surgical intensive care units in a university hospital. PATIENTS: All patients who needed central venous catheterization were randomized to receive either an uncoated triple-lumen catheter (n = 157) or a <b>catheter</b> <b>coated</b> with CSS (n = 151). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Catheters were removed when no longer needed or suspected {{as a cause of}} infection. The tip and a 5 -cm segment of the intradermal portion of the catheter were cultured semiquantitatively. Blood cultures were obtained when clinically indicated. The remaining segment of <b>catheters</b> <b>coated</b> with CSS were cut and incubated on an agar plate with strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus. Zone of inhibition was determined 24 hours later. Data were analyzed by survival and logistic multivariate regression methods. RESULTS: <b>Catheters</b> <b>coated</b> with CSS were effective in reducing the rate of significant bacterial growth on either the tip or intradermal segment (40 %) compared with control catheters (52 %; P =. 04). However, {{there was no difference in}} the incidence of catheter-related bacteremia (3. 8 % [uncoated] vs 3. 3 % [coated]; P =. 81). In vitro activity of catheters with CSS against S aureus was evident up to 25 days but activity against Enterococcus dissipated more quickly over time and was absent by day 4. The most common colonizing organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococcus and enterococcus. Variables that were associated with a significant amount of growth on the tip or intradermal segment were a duration of catheterization of longer than 7 days, jugular insertion site, and the absence of a CSS coating. The use of a guidewire when the catheter was removed was associated with a lower risk of significant bacterial growth. CONCLUSIONS: The use of CSS reduces the incidence of significant bacterial growth on either the tip or intradermal segments of <b>coated</b> triple-lumen <b>catheters</b> but has no effect on the incidence of catheter-related bacteremia. In this patient population, <b>catheters</b> <b>coated</b> with CSS provide no additional benefit over uncoated catheters...|$|R

40|$|Catheter {{associated}} {{urinary tract}} infections are common during hospitalization {{due to the}} formation of bacterial biofilms on the indwelling device. In this study, we report an innovative biotechnology-based approach for the covalent functionalization of silicone catheters with antifouling zwitterionic moieties to prevent biofilm formation. Our approach combines the potential bioactivity of a natural phenolics layer biocatalytically conjugated to sulfobetaine-acrylic residues in an enzymatically initiated surface radical polymerization with laccase. To ensure sufficient coating stability in urine, the silicone catheter is plasma-activated. In contrast to industrial chemical methods, the methacrylate-containing zwitterionic monomers are polymerized at pH 5 and 50 °C using as an initiator the phenoxy radicals solely generated by laccase on the phenolics-coated <b>catheter</b> surface.

30|$|In recent years, many {{approaches}} {{have been developed}} to reduce CRBSIs. The most promising approach is the use of central line bundles, which are recommended by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement as a means to improve patient care. Bundles include five components of care: hand hygiene, maximal barrier precautions, chlorhexidine skin antisepsis, optimal catheter site selection, and daily review of central line necessity. According to recent data, the implementation of central line bundles may reduce the rate of CRBSIs [5]. However, whether {{there are other ways to}} reduce CRBSIs has attracted the attention of scholars. Alternative methods include <b>coating</b> or impregnating <b>catheters</b> with anti-infective agents, including antibiotics, antiseptics, and antimetabolites. Moreover, CVCs that have been coated internally and/or externally with silver have also been shown to cause a lower incidence of catheter colonization and CRBSIs [6]. However, other authors have found the opposite results. It therefore remains controversial whether the incidence of CRBSIs is lower for <b>coated</b> <b>catheters</b> than for conventional standard catheters [7, 8]. The literature regarding various types of antimicrobial catheters and their effectiveness in preventing vascular-related blood-stream infections, especially with the implementation of bundles, remains sparse. Traditional meta-analyses can only compare two options that have been directly compared in head-to-head trials, and there is currently no consensus recommendation regarding which antimicrobial-coated CVC/bundle combination is best. Network meta-analyses (also called multiple or mixed treatment comparison meta-analyses, or MTCs) permit the evaluation of the comparative effectiveness of multiple interventions even when some pairs have not been directly compared and can potentially reduce uncertainty in treatment effect estimates [9, 10]. Given this background, our main aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of antimicrobial-coated catheters in comparison with standard catheters as measured by the rate of CRBSIs per 1000 catheter-days among patients who received CVC and bundles. The incidence of catheter colonization was also studied as a secondary outcome. We hypothesized that antimicrobial-coated CVCs are more effective than standard catheters in preventing CRBSIs and catheter colonization in patients who received CVC and bundles.|$|R

40|$|Background. Haemodialysis (HD) catheter-related {{blood stream}} infections {{are a major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mor-tality in patients with acute and chronic renal failure. Methods. We conducted a randomized, prospective, dou-ble-blinded trial investigating the clinical value of bis-muth-coated non-tunneled HD catheters in patients in need of temporary short-term vascular access. A stan-dard catheter (SC) was compared to a surface-modified, bismuth-film-coated catheter (FCC). After removal of the catheter for any reason, both arterial and venous lu-mina were rinsed and the fluid cultured for detection of bacterial colony-forming units (CFU). The catheter tip was placed in a tube containing sterile saline, sonicated and shortly centrifuged to remove debris (3 min at 1000 g). The supernatant was cultured and assayed for DNA content. Results. Seventy-seven patients in three HD units were randomized. Thirteen patients suffered from acute renal failure, 60 patients from chronic renal failure, and four pa-tients without renal insufficiency were treated with plasma exchange. The time to catheter removal was not signifi-cantly different between groups, with a mean of 18. 5 ± 2 days for SC and 15. 1 ± 2 days for FCC. In most cases, the reasons for catheter removal were related to no further need for extracorporeal therapy or establishment of a per-manent vascular access. Six catheters for SC and four ca-theters for FCC were removed because of presumed infection. Bacterial colonization was significantly lower for <b>coated</b> <b>catheters</b> compared to standard catheters, both for cultured catheter tips as well as for CFU in rinse fluid...|$|R
40|$|Catheters {{and other}} {{indwelling}} devices placed inside human body {{are prone to}} bacterial infection, causing serious risk to patients. Infections associated with implants are difficult to resolve, and hence the prevention of bacterial colonization of such surfaces is quite appropriate. In this context, the development of novel antimicrobial biomaterials is currently gaining momentum. We describe here the preparation and antibacterial properties of an enzyme-embedded polycaprolactone (PCL) -based coating, coimpregnated with the antibiotic gentamicin sulfate (GS). The enzyme uses PCL itself as substrate; as a result, the antibiotic gets released at a rate controlled by the degradation of the PCL base. In vitro drug release studies demonstrated sustained release of GS from the PCL film throughout its lifetime. By modulating the enzyme concentration in the PCL film, {{we were able to}} vary the lifetime of the coating from 33 h to 16 days. In the end, the polymer is completely degraded, delivering the entire load of the antibiotic. The polymer exhibited antibacterial properties against three test isolates: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Foley urinary <b>catheters</b> <b>coated</b> with the modified polymer exhibited sustained in vitro release of GS over a 60 -h period. The results suggest that the antibiotic-plus-enzyme-loaded polymer can be used as tunable self-degrading antimicrobial biomaterial <b>coating</b> on <b>catheters...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective. The primary aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{incidence}} of catheter-associated bacteriuria with a noble metal alloy-coated latex catheter or a non-coated silicone catheter in patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery with short-term catheterization. Secondary objectives included identifying risk factors for bacteriuria and catheter-associated urinary tract symptoms. Material and methods. The study compared 217 patients randomized to and receiving a silicone catheter with 222 patients treated with a <b>coated</b> latex <b>catheter.</b> Before removal of the catheter a sample for urinary culture was obtained. Bacteriuria was defined as the growth of ≥ 100 000 cfu/ml. A logistic regression model was used to identify risk groups for bacteriuria. Patients were interviewed about urinary tract symptoms during and after catheterization. Results. The incidence of bacteriuria was 1. 5 % with the <b>coated</b> latex <b>catheter</b> and 5. 5 % with the silicone catheter (p = 0. 027) after a mean period of 2 days' catheterization time. Female gender (odds ratio 6. 02) and obesity (odds ratio 5. 08) were significant risk factors for bacteriuria. A quarter of the patients reported at least one symptom from the urinary tract during and after catheterization. Most patients defined the symptoms as "yes, a little" and a few consulted a healthcare professional because of the symptoms. Conclusion. This study confirmed previous results that the noble metal alloy coating significantly reduces the risk of catheter-associated bacteriuria in short-term catheterization (1 - 3 days). Female gender and obesity were significant risk factors for developing bacteriuria, while the use of an open drainage system and insertion of the catheter on the ward were not...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, central venous {{catheters}} (CVCs) {{are increasingly}} used in clinical practice. However, complications such as local or systemic infections are frequent for both temporary and indwelling vascular catheters. Annually, in the United States of America {{there are more}} than 200, 000 cases of nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSIs), of which 90 % are related to the use of an intravascular device. These infections are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospitalization and growing medical costs. Technological treatments of polymer surfaces including <b>coating</b> the <b>catheter</b> with antimicrobial substances may be promising tools for prevention of catheter-associated infections. A large number of surface-treated central venous catheters are now commercially available. In this paper the features and the clinical efficacy of different antimicrobial coatings are reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Urinary {{catheterization}} occurs {{widespread in}} the United States with one quarter of all hospital patients experiencing it. Catheter problems include blockage, leakage, and infections and are predominately caused by proteins that adhere to the catheter surface and quickly build up on each other forming a protein layer. Current strategies to avoid these problems include <b>coating</b> a <b>catheter</b> with silver alloy to reduce bacteria on the catheter surface. An alternative solution is presented involving coating latex, a common urinary catheter material, with a microlayer (5 - 100 microns) of polyethylene glycol. This hydrogel is applied using an interfacial photopolymerizatoin process with ethyl eosin as the photoinitiator. A 25 PPM concentration of ethyl eosin provided the strongest gel to surface adhesion and significantly lowered protein adhesion when compared to an uncoated latex substrate...|$|R

This is evidenced by a broad variety of new classes of compounds that have been prepared and studiedin the past few years.Modification of polymers and fibrous surfaces, and changing the porosity, wettability, and other characteristics of the polymeric substrates, should produce implants and biomedical devices with greater resistance to microbial adhesion and biofilm formation. A number of polymers have been developed that can be incorporated into cellulose and other materials, which should provide significant advances in many fields such as food packaging, textiles, wound dressing, <b>coating</b> of <b>catheter</b> tubes, and necessarily sterile surfaces. The greater need for materials that fight infection will give incentive for discovery and use of antimicrobial polymers.|$|R
