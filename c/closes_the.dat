5|$|Among the park's most {{distinctive}} and well-known features are the vehicular river crossings. At three places, crossing Pine Creek, fords were constructed instead of bridges. The fords offer visitors {{a chance to}} actually drive through the creek, though high water frequently <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> crossings. Hikers are relegated to pedestrian bridges or stepping stones in the creek to cross the stream. Floods are frequent enough on Pine Creek, a large watershed {{to the north of}} the park, that there is an emergency exit from the campground. When high water <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> fords, the campground is cut off and the emergency exit is the only way out.|$|E
5|$|Platform C7 is an L-shaped {{platform}} that <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> east side and {{northeast corner of}} the East Plaza. Steps run {{the entire length of}} the platform.|$|E

5|$|Afterwards, the two {{follow the}} cloud to a castle. There, the cloud {{condenses}} into a demonic form, presumably Hunson Abadeer. While {{running through the}} castle, Finn and Jake find a portal back to Ooo, and the two jump in, with Abadeer in pursuit. Finn wounds the demon with his sword. At that moment it is revealed that the demon is not Hunson Abadeer, but rather Marceline, who has for some unknown reason, {{been transformed into a}} hideous demon. She musters enough strength to forbid Finn and Jake from coming back to the Nightosphere, and, after the two are teleported back to their dimension, she <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> portal.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the fifth}} week, {{there is an}} opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass {{directly}} from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing some blood to bypass the lungs. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as a valve <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern. A depression in the surface of the right atrium remains where the foramen ovale once walls, called the fossa ovalis.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2005, {{citing a}} lack of {{advertising}} dollars, owner Wallis Bolz <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> newspaper.

5|$|English doctor Maxwell (Shearsmith) {{settles into}} bunk 9E while {{travelling}} from Paris to Bourg-Saint-Maurice. Maxwell is disturbed first by Jorg (Pemberton), a drunk, flatulent German who climbs into bunk 9D, then by Kath (Hesmondhalgh) and Les (Benton), a couple travelling to their daughter's wedding. Jorg is in Les's bed, but the couple climb into 9A. Australian backpacker Shona (Gunning) enters; she places her bag on bunk 9C then leaves, and Maxwell <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> door. Kath and Les, laughing at Maxwell, begin to undress on the bed. Les wakes Jorg, but understanding is limited until Maxwell translates. Jorg switches to 9F and Les climbs into 9D.|$|E
5|$|Lonnie is {{repelled}} by his uncle's treatment of Homer and Alma {{and leaves the}} ranch after his grandfather's funeral, uncertain if he will ever return. When he tells Hud to put his half of their inheritance in the bank, his uncle replies that Lonnie now sees him as Homer did. Hud {{goes back into the}} Bannon house alone; as he <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> door, the final fade-out is the window shade's pull-ring swaying.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Primes second full sequel is , which <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> Prime series. It was {{released}} on August 27, 2007, for the Wii console. In Corruptions story, Samus is corrupted by Phazon after being attacked by Dark Samus, who has become {{the leader of a}} Space Pirate group and is sending Phazon Seeds to corrupt planets. Corruptions gameplay differs from that of Prime and Echoes; the assisted aiming is replaced with free aiming with the Wii Remote, and the interchangeable beams are replaced with a stackable upgrade system.|$|E

5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{initially}} makes {{light of}} the exposure incident. After being shamed by how offended the other employees are by his antics, he attempts to reassert his sensitivity to women by holding a seminar on women's issues. He <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> meeting by offering to take the women to the Mall at Steamtown. Before leaving, he receives a call from Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), who asks {{to meet with him}} to have sex. Michael balks at the proposal, and only becomes more uncomfortable when she offers to pay him for the sex.|$|E
5|$|More complex {{parts are}} formed using more complex moulds. These may have {{sections}} called slides, that {{move into a}} cavity perpendicular to the draw direction, to form overhanging part features. When the mould is opened, the slides are {{pulled away from the}} plastic part by using stationary “angle pins” on the stationary mould half. These pins enter a slot in the slides and cause the slides to move backward when the moving half of the mould opens. The part is then ejected and the mould <b>closes.</b> <b>The</b> closing action of the mould causes the slides to move forward along the angle pins.|$|E
5|$|Taking a {{page out}} of Chazz Palminteri's A Bronx Tale, Rosenbaum ignored the script during his final scene with Kristin Kreuk {{for the season}} six finale. Here, as Lana is informing Lex that {{she is going to}} leave, Lex walks around her and <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> door to her exit. Rosenbaum was trying to invoke a moment of fright for the {{audience}}. To the actor, he wanted the audience to wonder what Lex was going to do to Lana; it was a moment meant to show just how unpredictable Lex can be.|$|E
50|$|In 2009 the State of Michigan {{took control}} of the school {{district}}. Attempts to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> school began after the takeover. The district had considered <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> school in 2010, but Robert Bobb, the Emergency Financial Manager, cancelled <b>the</b> <b>closing.</b> Bobb had also considered <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> school in 2010 and on one other occasion. Parents of students at DDSD said that they persuaded him to keep the school open both times.|$|R
5|$|Another {{theory is}} that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the {{apartment}} by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell {{into one of the}} open construction sites nearby. This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, <b>close</b> <b>the</b> curtains behind her, <b>close</b> <b>the</b> door again, open and <b>close</b> <b>the</b> child gate {{at the top of the}} stairs, then open and <b>close</b> <b>the</b> gate leading to the street.|$|R

5|$|The player {{takes the}} role {{of one of the}} three Jack {{brothers}} – Jack Frost, Jack Lantern, or Jack Skelton – who have visited the human world for Halloween, and need to return to the fairy world before the portal connecting the two worlds <b>closes.</b> <b>The</b> player needs to make their way through six areas, which consist of a number of floors, defeating enemies by using character-specific attacks and collecting keys to be able to advance to the next floor. It received generally positive reception for its gameplay, but was criticized for the lack of puzzle elements and under-utilization of the Virtual Boy's 3D effect.|$|E
5|$|These small {{whales are}} also {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar bear is well adapted for hunting Arctic whales and calves. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Whales lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. This however means less room around the breathing hole as the ice slowly <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> gap. When out at sea, whales dive {{out of the reach}} of surface-hunting orcas. Polar bear attacks on belugas and narwhals are usually successful in winter, but rarely inflict any damage in summer.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} a nocturnal forest-dweller that reproduces once in late March–May {{and once in}} September–December, having one or two young each time. During the day, the mother digs {{a hole in the}} ground, for her young to hide in. At night, she opens the {{entrance}} to the hole, while watching for predators (such as venomous snakes), and then nurses her young, after which she <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> hole with soil and plant material by thumping on it with her front paws. Amami rabbits sleep during the day in hidden locations, such as caves. They are also noted for having a call similar to that of a pika.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>closing</b> {{ceremony}} of <b>the</b> Maccabiah Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded.
