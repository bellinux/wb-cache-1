Some of the distant exterior shots were filmed using a model train.|$|R
5000|$|MC Metals was a metal {{recycling}} {{company based}} in the Springburn area of Glasgow, Scotland. The [...] "MC" [...] stands for McWilliam & Christie, both names being associated with separate railway scrapyards that previously existed in the Glasgow area. The company was made famous through the scrapping of huge numbers of British <b>Rail</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives</b> in the 1980s and 1990s. They operated on railway-owned land adjacent to the British Rail Engineering Limited St. Rollox railway works. A condition of their lease was that only ex-railway scrap could be processed there. They also carried out asbestos removal work on stock destined for preservation. Rail vehicles arrived {{from all parts of}} the UK via a rail connection or by road. The site is now occupied by a Tesco supermarket.|$|R
50|$|The British <b>Rail</b> Class 15 <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives,</b> {{also known}} as the BTH Type 1, were {{designed}} by British Thomson-Houston, and built by the Yorkshire Engine Company and the Clayton Equipment Company, between 1957 and 1961.|$|R

5000|$|The GWR chose a gas-turbine {{locomotive}} because, at the time, {{there was}} no single-unit <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive</b> of sufficient power available. The King class steam locomotive could deliver about [...] at the <b>rail.</b> The LMS <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives</b> had engines of only [...] After allowing for transmission losses, this would be down to about [...] at the <b>rail,</b> so two <b>diesels</b> {{would be needed to}} match a King.|$|R

500|$|On 13 April 1986, a British <b>Rail</b> Class 37 <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive</b> number 37427 {{was named}} [...] "Bont Y Bermo" [...] to {{celebrate}} the (short-lived) re-introduction of locomotive-hauled trains following repairs in 1985–1986. Following major repairs the weight restriction was relaxed in 2005, and locomotive-hauled trains have again been allowed to cross.|$|R
50|$|The British <b>Rail</b> Class 07 <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive</b> is an off-centre cab dock shunter used in Southampton Docks, {{to replace}} SR USA Class steam locomotives. It is a 0-6-0 {{diesel-electric}} shunter built by Ruston & Hornsby in 1962. They were originally numbered D2985-D2998 and later given the TOPS numbers 07001(D2985)-07013(D2997), D2998.|$|R
50|$|Under British Railways the {{locomotives}} became British Railways Class D16/1; {{they were}} initially operated primarily on mainline express passenger services on former LMS lines, both in single and in multiple. In 1953 they {{were transferred to}} the Southern Region for comparison with O. Bulleid's British <b>Rail</b> Class D16/2 <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The British <b>Rail</b> Class 10 <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive</b> was a {{variation}} on the Class 08 diesel-electric shunter in which a Blackstone diesel engine was fitted instead of one made by the English Electric company.

50|$|Freight {{is handled}} at Altenkirchen {{operating}} over the Holzbach Valley Railway (Siershahn-Altenkirchen railway). Since 2006, Westerwaldbahn GmbH (WEBA) has been serving freight customers by rail on the Selters-Raubach-Altenkirchen route, including a siding in Neitersen and the Schutztankbau company in Selters, {{where the line}} runs between the factory buildings. Class On <b>Rail</b> DH 1004 <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives</b> are used.|$|R
5000|$|The {{train was}} hauled by British <b>Rail</b> Class 20 <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives</b> 20903, 20901 and 20902 {{belonging}} to Direct Rail Services. [...] The route covered 4500 km {{and the train}} arrived at Fushë Kosovë railway station in Kosovo Polje, near Pristina, on 27 September 1999 following delays—it had originally been intended to arrive on 25 September 1999.|$|R
2500|$|As well as passengers, {{the line}} transported granite between Beckfoot Quarry and Murthwaite {{crushing}} plant. From Murthwaite to Ravenglass the track ran as dual gauge for a time, with [...] track straddling the [...] gauge <b>rails.</b> A <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive</b> was obtained in 1929 {{to work this}} section and details are in Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway locomotives. The line carried much of the goods and produce for the valley. By the mid-1920s, the line had been extended to its present terminus at Dalegarth Station. Passenger trains did not run during World War II.|$|R
25|$|The British <b>Rail</b> Class 24 <b>diesel</b> <b>{{locomotives}},</b> {{also known}} as the Sulzer Type 2, were built from 1958 to 1961. One hundred and fifty-one of these locomotives were built at Derby, Crewe and Darlington, the first twenty of them as part of the British Rail 1955 Modernisation Plan. This class was used {{as the basis for the}} development of the Class 25 locomotives.|$|R
50|$|In British <b>Rail</b> days most <b>diesel</b> <b>{{locomotive}}s</b> {{were built}} {{to a maximum}} axle load of 19 LT so the maximum locomotive weight was 76 LT for a four-axle locomotive and 114 LT for a six-axle one. Higher axle loads are now permitted, e.g. the Class 67 locomotive is a four-axle machine weighing 90 t, giving 22.5 t on each axle.|$|R
50|$|In September 1999, {{after the}} Kosovo War, the Kosovo Train for Life arrived at Kosovo Polje station, {{carrying}} 400 tonnes of aid, having traveled all the {{away from the}} United Kingdom, through the Channel Tunnel, and via France, Belgium, Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and Macedonia, hauled by a trio of British <b>Rail</b> Class 20 <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the past, each railway adopted its own {{identification}} system. Each locomotive {{was given}} a road number or running number which would sometimes be combined with a class number. For example British <b>Rail</b> <b>diesel</b> and electric <b>locomotives</b> had five-digit numbers of which the first two digits were the class number and the remaining digits were the running number, e.g. 37 409.|$|R
50|$|The British <b>Rail</b> Class 26 <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives,</b> {{also known}} as the BRCW Type 2, were built by the Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Company (BRCW) at Smethwick in 1958-59. Forty seven {{examples}} were built, and the last were withdrawn from service in 1994. Like their higher-powered sisters, the BRCW Classes 27 and 33, they had all-steel bodies and cab ends with fibreglass cab roofs.|$|R
50|$|Increased use of <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives</b> in North America {{during and}} after the Second World War saw CNR {{completely}} dieselize its operations on Prince Edward Island by the late 1940s as a means to save money on hauling bulk coal to the province. This meant that Prince Edward Island <b>rail</b> lines had <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives</b> fully one decade before the rest of Canada saw the last of steam, giving the province a prominent place in Canadian railway history {{as one of the first}} regional dieselization projects.|$|R
50|$|Stock that is {{allocated}} {{and maintained}} at Derby Etches Park are the East Midlands Trains Class 222, and Class 156 fleets.East Midlands Trains also stable Class 153s, Class 158s and HSTs at Derby Etches Park, although these are maintained and allocated elsewhere; Neville Hill depot for the HST fleet, and Nottingham Eastcroft depot for the 153 and 158 fleets. There is a British <b>Rail</b> Class 08 <b>Diesel</b> <b>Locomotive</b> Shunter in operation.|$|R
5|$|By the 1980s {{a number}} of {{heritage}} railways had been established in Victoria on closed branch lines. These railways serve both as tourist attractions, and to preserve the railway past. The work of railway preservation groups has since expanded to retired railway carriages, electric multiple units, <b>rail</b> motors, and <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives.</b> In 2006 heritage railways carried 542,000 patrons over 161km of track; with 28 operational steam <b>locomotives,</b> 47 <b>diesels,</b> 14 railmotors, and 192 carriages.|$|R
50|$|In Great Western Railway {{days the}} shed {{was home to}} two locomotives, {{normally}} as an outstation from St Blazey engine shed or, for a few years, Laira TMD. 0-6-0STs of 850 and 2021 classes gave way in 1924 to larger 2-6-2Ts of GWR 4400 Class and then 4500 and 4575 classes. The shed closed on 11 September 1961 after which the branch was worked by DMUs and British <b>Rail</b> Class 22 <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
