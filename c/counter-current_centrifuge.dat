40|$|The {{equation}} for diffusion in {{a binary}} gas mixture is integrated over each {{of a number}} of elements into which the R-Z system volume is divided. The resulting equations are soluble using the TWIST programme to give the mass fraction variation through the system. The Programme is suitable for analysis of any device which utilises pressure diffusion for the separation of a binary gas mixture, the components of which have approximately equal molecular weights and is describable in the R-Z coordinate system. Applications include the centrifuge, the vortex tube and the Vortex Matrix. A knowledge of the mixture mass flow and pressure distribution throughout the system is assumed. A weakness of this method is the requirement of a fine subdivision of the system volume when such flows are large. The TWIST programme has been applied to a <b>counter-current</b> <b>centrifuge</b> and the results compared with those from Cohen's theory...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} {{separation}} of isotopes in a concurrent gas centrifuge is solved analytically for an arbitrary binary mixture of isotopes. The separative power of the optimised concurrent gas centrifuges for the uranium isotopes equals to δU =  12. 7 (V/ 700  m/s) 2 (300  K/T) (L/ 1  m) kg·SWU/yr, where L and V are the length and linear velocity of the rotor of the gas centrifuge and T is the temperature. This equation agrees well with the empirically determined separative power of optimised <b>counter-current</b> gas <b>centrifuges...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{paper has}} {{addressed}} decade sought-after questions on phase bilateral distribution and stationary phase retention in any J-type high-speed <b>counter-current</b> chromatographic (CCC) <b>centrifuge.</b> Using a 2 -D spiral column operated {{on such a}} CCC device and an aqueous two-phase system, this work systematically observed the phase interaction during transitional period and at dynamic equilibration under stroboscopic illumination. The experimental results thus obtained were {{used to examine the}} effects of the liquid–solid friction force, tangential centrifugal force, and physical properties of the two-phase system on hydrodynamic phase behaviour. We identified that (a) density difference between lower and upper phases is the critical factor to cause unusual phase bilateral distribution in the 2 -D spiral column and (b) interfacial tension (manifested primarily as phase settling time) of any two-phase system is the critical factor in explaining inability to retain stationary phase in 3 -D helical column and, for certain flow modes, in the 2 -D spiral column. This work thus has extended or modified the well-established rule-of-thumb for operating J-type CCC devices and our conclusions can accommodate virtually all the anomalies concerning both hydrophobic and hydrophilic phase systems. To this end, this work has not only documented valuable experimental evidences for directly observing phase behaviour in a CCC column, but also finally resolved fundamentally vital issues on bilateral phase distribution orientation and stationary phase retention in 2 -D spiral and 3 -D helical CCC columns. Revised recommendations to end users of this technology could thus be derived out of the essence of the present work presumably following further experimental validation and a consensus in the CCC R&D and manufacturing circle...|$|R
