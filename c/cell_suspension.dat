5|$|In the laboratory, {{bacteria}} are usually grown using solid or liquid media. Solid growth media, such as agar plates, {{are used to}} isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain. However, liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required. Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even <b>cell</b> <b>suspension,</b> making the cultures easy to divide and transfer, although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult. The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms.|$|E
25|$|Cell {{suspensions}} are turbid. Cells {{absorb and}} scatter the light. The higher the cell concentration, {{the higher the}} turbidity. Spectrophotometers can measure intensity of light very accurately. The cell culture is placed in a transparent cuvette and the absorption is measured relative to medium alone. Optical density (OD) is directly proportional to the biomass in the <b>cell</b> <b>suspension</b> in a given range that is specific to the cell type. Using spectrophotometry for measuring the turbidity of cultures is known as turbidometry.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cell</b> <b>suspension</b> is entrained in {{the center}} of a narrow, rapidly flowing stream of liquid. The flow is {{arranged}} so that there is a large separation between cells relative to their diameter. A vibrating mechanism causes the stream of cells to break into individual droplets. The system is adjusted so that there is a low probability of more than one cell per droplet. Just before the stream breaks into droplets, the flow passes through a fluorescence measuring station where the fluorescent character of each cell of interest is measured. An electrical charging ring is placed just at the point where the stream breaks into droplets. A charge is placed on the ring based immediately prior to fluorescence intensity being measured, and the opposite charge is trapped on the droplet as it breaks from the stream. The charged droplets then fall through an electrostatic deflection system that diverts droplets into containers based upon their charge. In some systems, the charge is applied directly to the stream, and the droplet breaking off retains charge of the same sign as the stream. The stream is then returned to neutral after the droplet breaks off.|$|E
40|$|In this work, a morpho-histological {{study of}} banana (Musa spp. cv. Grande Naine [AAA]) embryogenic <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions</b> during {{cryopreservation}} and regeneration was performed. It was {{demonstrated that the}} regeneration process of somatic embryos originating from cryopreserved <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions</b> was {{different from that of}} control <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions.</b> Somatic embryos originating from cryopreserved <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions</b> had a unicellular origin. The regeneration process was modified not only by freezing in liquid nitrogen but also by the plasmolyzing effect of the 0. 5 M sucrose solution employed during pretreatment. This result explained the high number of embryonic structures formed on M 3 medium, compared with the control. Proembryos blocked at the globular stage could pursue their development when they were plated on new culture medium at a lower density after 30 days of culture on M 3 medium. The unicellular origin of somatic embryos produced from cryopreserved <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions</b> offers the prospect of using cryopreservation to select non-chimeral transformed plants...|$|R

The effect of electroporation buffer on cell vitality and transient expression of the gene for beta-glucuronidase was also determined. Besides, the transient expression of GUS gene in em bryogenic <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions</b> electroporated with plasmid PDB-GUS-INT was studied.

25|$|Cells from bone marrow, blood, amniotic fluid, cord blood, tumor, and tissues (including skin, {{umbilical}} cord, chorionic villi, liver, {{and many}} other organs) can be cultured using standard cell culture techniques {{in order to increase}} their number. A mitotic inhibitor (colchicine, colcemid) is then added to the culture. This stops cell division at mitosis which allows an increased yield of mitotic cells for analysis. The cells are then centrifuged and media and mitotic inhibitor are removed, and replaced with a hypotonic solution. This causes the white blood cells or fibroblasts to swell so that the chromosomes will spread when added to a slide as well as lyses the red blood cells. After the cells have been allowed to sit in hypotonic solution, Carnoy's fixative (3:1 methanol to glacial acetic acid) is added. This kills the cells and hardens the nuclei of the remaining white blood cells. The cells are generally fixed repeatedly to remove any debris or remaining red blood cells. The <b>cell</b> <b>suspension</b> is then dropped onto specimen slides. After aging the slides in an oven or waiting a few days they are ready for banding and analysis.|$|E

[...] Muse cells (multi-lineage differentiating stress enduring cells) are a recently discovered pluripotent stem cell type found in multiple adult tissues, including adipose, dermal fibroblasts, and bone marrow. While rare, muse cells are identifiable by their expression of SSEA-3, a marker for undifferentiated stem cells, and general mesenchymal stem cells markers such as CD105.

2500|$|Freeze-fracture or freeze-etch – a {{preparation}} method particularly useful for examining lipid membranes and their incorporated proteins in [...] "face on" [...] view. The fresh tissue or <b>cell</b> <b>suspension</b> is frozen rapidly (cryofixation), then fractured by breaking or {{by using a}} microtome while maintained at liquid nitrogen temperature. The cold fractured surface (sometimes [...] "etched" [...] by increasing the temperature to about −100°C for several minutes to let some ice sublime) is then shadowed with evaporated platinum or gold at an average angle of 45° in a high vacuum evaporator. A second coat of carbon, evaporated perpendicular to the average surface plane is often performed to improve stability of the replica coating. The specimen is returned to room temperature and pressure, then the extremely fragile [...] "pre-shadowed" [...] metal replica of the fracture surface is released from the underlying biological material by careful chemical digestion with acids, hypochlorite solution or SDS detergent. The still-floating replica is thoroughly washed free from residual chemicals, carefully fished up on fine grids, dried then viewed in the TEM.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} {{method for}} the successful ex vivo propagation of P. falciparum described culture of the parasite under static conditions (Trager-Jensen method). James B. Jensen joined Trager’s laboratory as a post-doctoral fellow in 1976. [...] He decided to employ a candlejar instead of the [...] incubator. In the summer of 1976 Milton Friedman, {{a graduate student in}} the Trager lab who was working in the MRC laboratories in The Gambia, arranged for a sample of human blood infected with P. falciparum to be sent to New York City. This was diluted with RPMI 1640 (which {{turned out to be the}} best of the commercial media) in Petri dishes, placed in a candlejar and incubated. The line grew very well and became FCR-3/Gambia, one of the most widely used strains. Later, other lines would be established using similar methods and the impact of continuous cultivation of P. falciparum was phenomenal especially for the testing of putative antimalarials and for deciphering its genes. A number of subsequent reports (from as far back as the early 1980s), showed that <b>cell</b> <b>suspension</b> (using a shaking-incubator) significantly increased culture growth. Continuous agitation has also been shown to improve other parameters of culture growth relevant to researchers, such as the prolongation of culture synchrony after synchronization procedures, and a reduction of the rate of multiple infections. [...] Despite this, the practice of culturing the parasite under static conditions remains widespread. The greatest value of the candlejar method is that it can be used in laboratories almost anywhere in the world where there is an incubator, a candle and a desiccator. Around 60% parasitized cells can be obtained using optimized culturing conditions. Recent studies of P. falciparum isolated directly from infected patients indicate that alternative parasite biological states occur in the natural host that are not observed with ex vivo cultivated parasites.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAlthough grape berries {{have been}} {{classified}} as non climacteric fruits, ongoing studies on grape ethylene signalling lead {{to challenge the}} role of ethylene in their ripening. One of the significant molecular changes in berries is the up regulation of ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase, EC. 1. 1. 1. 1) enzyme activity at the inception of fruit ripening and of VvADH 2 transcript levels. This paper shows that the ethylene signal transduction pathway could {{be involved in the}} control of VvADH 2 expression in grapevine berries and in <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions.</b> The induction of VvADH 2 transcription, either in berries at the inception of ripening or in <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions,</b> was found to be partly inhibited by 1 methylcyclopropene (1 MCP), an inhibitor of ethylene receptors. Treatment of <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions</b> with 2 chloroethylphosphonic acid (2 -CEPA), an ethylene releasing compound, also resulted in a significant increase of ADH activity and VvADH 2 transcription under anaerobiosis, showing that concomitant ethylene and anaerobic treatments in <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions</b> could result in changes of VvADH 2 expression. All these results, associated with the presence in the VvADH 2 promoter of regulatory elements for ethylene and anaerobic response, suggest that ethylene transduction pathway and anaerobic stress could be in part involved in the regulation of VvADH 2 expression in ripening berries and <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions.</b> These data open new aspects of the expression control of a ripening-related gene in a non climacteric fruit...|$|R
