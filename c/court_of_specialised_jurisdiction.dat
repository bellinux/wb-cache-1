500|$|Croatia has a three-tiered, {{independent}} {{judicial system}} {{governed by the}} Constitution of Croatia and national legislation enacted by the Sabor. The Supreme Court (...) is the highest <b>court</b> <b>of</b> appeal in Croatia, while municipal and county <b>courts</b> are <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> general <b>jurisdiction.</b> <b>Specialised</b> <b>courts</b> in Croatia are: commercial courts and the Superior Commercial Court, misdemeanour courts and the Superior Misdemeanour Court, administrative courts and the Superior Administrative Court. Croatian Constitutional Court (...) is a court that deals primarily with constitutional law. Its main authority is to rule on whether laws that are challenged are in fact unconstitutional, i.e., whether they conflict with constitutionally established rights and freedoms. The State Attorney's Office represents the state in legal proceedings.|$|R

50|$|There {{are also}} {{additional}} federal courts established by Parliament, {{which have a}} <b>specialised</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in certain areas of federal law.

From 1965 to 1979 he was an {{advocate}} to the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> South Africa, <b>specialising</b> in commercial law; he was appointed senior counsel in 1975. He became a judge <b>of</b> the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> South Africa in 1977. He resigned that post in 1980 [...] - [...] reportedly after an altercation with Prime Minister P. W.

40|$|Combining {{existing}} {{information with}} a newly collected dataset, the paper develops {{indicators of the}} performance and the institutional characteristics of OECD judicial systems. It provides cross-country comparisons of measures of trial length, accessibility to justice services and predictability of decisions. It then investigates how trial length is related {{to some of the}} underlying characteristics of the systems. There is a large cross-country variation in trial length and in appeal rates (a proxy of the predictability of decisions), which are only partially explained by restrictions to appeal. Cross-country differences in trial length are related to the shares of the justice budget devoted to computerisation, the systematic production of statistics on case-flow, the active management of the progress <b>of</b> cases by <b>courts,</b> the presence <b>of</b> <b>specialised</b> commercial <b>courts</b> and systems <b>of</b> <b>court</b> governance assigning greater managerial responsibilities to the chief judge. Indicators of good public governance are associated with lower litigation, which in turn has a significant impact on trial length. Free negotiation of lawyers’ fees, as opposed to regulated fees, appears to be associated with lower litigation...|$|R
5000|$|Czech {{administrative}} judiciary (správní soudnictví) has two layers. The lower one consists <b>of</b> <b>specialised</b> administrative chambers within regional courts, which act as <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> first instance. The <b>court</b> <b>of</b> {{second and}} last instance is the Supreme Administrative <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> the Czech Republic (...) , seated in Brno, which, {{as the name}} suggests, is dedicated exclusively to administrative justice.|$|R
25|$|New Zealand's {{judiciary}} is {{a hierarchy}} consisting <b>of</b> the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> New Zealand, the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Appeal of New Zealand, the High <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> New Zealand, and the District Courts. These <b>courts</b> are all <b>of</b> general jurisdiction. There are several other <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> specialist jurisdiction, including the Employment Court, the Environment Court and the Māori Land Court, {{as well as}} the Family Court and the Youth Court, which operate as <b>specialised</b> divisions <b>of</b> the District <b>Courts.</b> There are also a number <b>of</b> <b>specialised</b> tribunals which operate in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity, such as the Disputes Tribunal, the Tenancy Tribunal and the Waitangi Tribunal.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is on the low number of {{requests}} made by women in order to attend domestic violence education programmes under section 29 (1) (a) of the Domestic Violence Act 1995. It examines the exchange of information between some Family Court clients and the associated Family Court practitioners when protection orders are obtained. This study acknowledges the low attendance at protected person' programmes and investigates how the information exchange fails to achieve greater numbers of participants on Family Court-funded programmes. The data is both qualitative and quantitative. The qualitative data comprises in-depth interviews with five protected persons and ten practitioners connected to the Family Court through their work with victims of domestic violence. The quantitative data is based upon a survey <b>of</b> twenty-two Family <b>Court</b> Coordinators. Both the interviews and the survey were designed to trace the processes used in exchanging significant information about the programmes, and to identify the successful methods of engaging more women in programmes. The study highlight the gap between the Family <b>Court's</b> provision <b>of</b> <b>specialised</b> services for abused women and the utilisation of those resources. The promotion of programmes has developed in an ad hoc manner which is reliant on the drive and commitment <b>of</b> key Family <b>Court</b> personnel. It is timely, three years after the introduction of the legislation, to examine why so few protected persons are requesting attendance at domestic violence programmes...|$|R
2500|$|The Tax <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Canada {{has a very}} <b>specialised</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> [...] It hears {{disputes}} over federal taxes, primarily under the federal Income Tax Act, between taxpayers and the federal government. Also, for most people that live in Canada, it is the Tax Court's power to hear appeals under the Income Tax Act. The Tax Court has the jurisdiction to hear appeals under various statues. However, as a federal court, it lacks the power to deal with disputes relating to provincial income taxes and provincial sales taxes, and has no jurisdiction to grant any relief where a taxpayer wishes to sue the Canada Revenue Agency for damages. Lastly, the Tax Court's powers are also limited by the statutes that impose the tax in dispute. The Tax Court is not empowered to make decisions {{on the basis that}} they will yield a fair result. Rather, the Tax Court can only make decisions based on its interpretation of the legislation.|$|R
50|$|When the {{requirement}} of leave to appeal was introduced {{at the beginning of}} 1980, the position <b>of</b> the Supreme <b>Court</b> as the court changed considerably. The earlier system of appeal with a hierarchy <b>of</b> three <b>court</b> instances was replaced by a system with two instances: a decision <b>of</b> a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> first instance may usually be appealed against to one superior court. Thereby the <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> appeal are the highest instance for most court proceedings, whereas the role <b>of</b> the Supreme <b>Court</b> clearly is that of creating precedents. Leave to appeal is also required for appeal against decisions <b>of</b> <b>specialised</b> <b>courts.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} <b>of</b> <b>specialised</b> nursing {{in breast}} cancer has received limited attention. This systematic literature review aims at (i) presenting and discussing role models <b>of</b> <b>specialised</b> nursing {{in the area of}} breast cancer and (ii) suggesting avenues for future research in this field. The ten studies included in the review differ with respect to the roles <b>of</b> <b>specialised</b> nurses as well as the measured outcome variables; thus, the comparability and generalisability of results are limited. Nevertheless, the review indicates that specialised nursing {{in breast cancer}} may contribute to improved physical and psycho-social well-being. In view of the limited comparability, the authors call for (i) a more uniform definition <b>of</b> models <b>of</b> <b>specialised</b> nursing in breast cancer care, as well as (ii) rigorous confirmatory studies to evaluate their effectiveness. These two aspects are pivotal in providing a reliable basis for future health care strategies...|$|R
