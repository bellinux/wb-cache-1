25|$|DBJRG {{launched}} an appeal, under Section 288 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, to the High Court, which was heard in March 2008 by Justice Mitting. A key issue was {{the refusal of}} RES to release the background noise data to Mr Hulme, to allow independent analysis.

In May, RES released the noise data, and errors were subsequently discovered by DBJRG, although RES denied that they were significant. DBJRG then took their case to the Court of Appeal, and permission to appeal was granted in June 2008.

25|$|In 2014, {{the command}} and {{responsibility}} of the Aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) Unit at the major Port Authority airports was transferred from the Port Authority Police Department to Port Authority Aviation Department.

The results of the FAA investigation cited numerous instances where Port Authority Police did not properly maintain training records that are mandated by the FAA. The FAA also discovered numerous instances where Port Authority Police permitted untrained officers {{to be placed in}} firefighter positions. Thousands of violations were found to be occurring for many years.

It issued a <b>consent</b> <b>order</b> that required PRSA to remove content from its code of conduct that contained sexist language, discouraged soliciting clients from other members or encouraged price-fixing activities. PRSA's first definition of public relations was created in 1982 as [...] "Public relations helps an organization and its publics adapt mutually to each other.” In 1986, PRSA's then President Anthony Franco resigned from his post after it was revealed he was accused of insider trading by the Securities Exchange Commission.
