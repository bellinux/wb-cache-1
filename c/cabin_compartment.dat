40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} the flight deck and cabin fire and smoke incidents reported to the Canadian airworthiness authorities over a ten year span. The fire and smoke related diversions are categorized to identify areas where efforts could be increased to improve safety. The costs of diversions are estimated to identify areas where operators could reduce costs by seeking technologies {{to reduce the number of}} diversions without any impact on safety. Only twenty-eight investigation reports into fire and smoke incidents onboard aircraft have been published over the past three decades. These reports are not sufficient to identify areas where operators can reduce their operating costs. The Canadian airworthiness authorities received over 1, 000 smoke and fire incidents from the years 2001 to 2010, of which, over 680 reported fire and smoke in the flight deck and <b>cabin</b> <b>compartments</b> for various makes and models of aircraft. Some of these flight deck and cabin incidents were related to in-flight entertainment or galley systems that were remedied while in-flight and did not require a diversion in most cases. The remaining incidents were found to be related to ingestion of oil, de-icing fluids and equipment and electrical failures that, in many cases, prompted the pilots to declare an emergency and divert. This paper categorizes the flight deck and cabin related fire and smoke incidents to suggest specific areas for airframers and operators to focus their efforts in reducing flight diversions that will not only reduce costs, but improve safety.

Each aircraft comprised five main sections: nose, forward fuselage, central section, rear fuselage and tail units; the wings were also built out of lengthwise sections. The forward section contained the pressure <b>cabin,</b> gun <b>compartments,</b> and forward undercarriage. The center section incorporated much of the structural elements, including the inner wing, engine nacelles, fuel tank, ammunition drums, and main undercarriage.

40|$|Environmental Control System (ECS) or Air Management System is {{a generic}} term used in {{aircraft}} industry for system and equipment associated with cooling, heating, ventilation, humidity/contaminant control and pressurization within aircraft occupied compartments, cargo compartments and electronic equipment bays. It also caters to other pneumatic demands like windshield demisting, aerofoil anti-icing, door-sealing, fuel-tank pressurization and engine bay ventilation. The real challenge for an ECS is to operate and supply adequate cooling {{over a wide}} range of ground and flight conditions in a most reliable and efficient manner. Ventilation to the cabin is normally through Environmental Control System (ECS), emergency back-up pressurization system and by ram air. Engines bleed air is used by the environmental control system to provide pressurization to the cabin. Refrigeration of the air is produced by a single bootstrap air cycle system (Air Conditioning Pack). The bleed air temperature control is accomplished automatically by an electronic controller in conjunction with an Electro Pneumatic Temperature Control Valve (TCV). This system is designed to maintain the <b>cabin</b> and crew <b>compartment</b> temperature in the range of 18 to 30 Â°C up to the aircraft ceiling of altitude of 30, 000 ft. This paper covers the system performance evaluation carried out for various engine power settings during ground tests on the aircraft and by empirical method. Further, instrumentation scheme adapted for measuring pressure and temperature for the above said evaluation has been discussed. Results of the tests show that the required mass flow rate and condition of the air entering in to the cabin is met, thus ECS performance is satisfactory. ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} a fifteen-month investigation, the NTSB {{determined}} that the fire that downed Flight 592 began in a cargo compartment below the passenger <b>cabin.</b> The cargo <b>compartment</b> was a Class D design, in which fire suppression is accomplished by sealing off the hold from outside air. Any fire in such an airtight compartment would quickly exhaust all available oxygen and then burn itself out. As the fire suppression is accomplished without any intervention by the crew, such holds are not equipped with smoke detectors. However, the NTSB {{determined that}} just before takeoff, over 100 expired chemical oxygen generators were placed in the cargo compartment in five boxes marked COMAT (company material) by ValuJet's maintenance contractor, SabreTech, in contravention of FAA regulations forbidding the transport of hazardous materials in aircraft cargo holds. Failure to cover the generators' firing pins with the prescribed plastic caps made an accidental activation much more likely. The investigation revealed that rather than covering the firing pins, the SabreTech workers simply duct-taped the cords around the cans, or cut them, and used tape to stick the ends down. The cylindrical, tennis-ball-can-sized generators also may have been loaded on board in the mistaken belief that they were just empty canisters, thus being certified as safe to transport in an aircraft cargo compartment. SabreTech employees indicated on the cargo manifest that the [...] "oxy canisters" [...] were [...] "empty" [...] instead of being expired oxygen generators. ValuJet employees interpreted this to mean they were empty oxygen canisters, when in fact they were neither simple oxygen canisters, nor empty. A worker then loosely packed the oxygen canisters in several cardboard boxes with a layer of bubble wrap.|$|R
