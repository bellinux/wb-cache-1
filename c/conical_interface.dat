40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} pressure based flush angle-of-attack measurement system, integrated on a Pitot-Static tube, is presented. The non-dimensional pressure difference between two static pressure ports located on {{the upper and lower}} surface of the <b>conical</b> <b>interface,</b> with half-cone-angle of 20 o, of the Pitot tube shows linear behavior (desirable) with angle-of-attack in the subsonic regime while in the supersonic regime it has non-linear behavior (undesirable). This non-linear behavior is attributed to shockwave induced flow separation just upstream of the <b>conical</b> <b>interface.</b> The undesirable non-linear trend can be eliminated by reducing the half-cone-angle of the <b>conical</b> <b>interface</b> from 20 o to 12 o. The reduction in half-cone-angle eliminates the upstream shockwave induced flow separation in the supersonic regime thereby restoring the linear behavior between non-dimensional pressure difference and angle-of-attack. However, reducing the <b>conical</b> <b>interface</b> half-cone-angle also reduces the sensitivity of the angle-of-attack measurement system in the subsonic regime by 18 %. Computational Fluid Dynamics tools have been used in the analysis and refinement of flush angle-of-attack measurement system. The complete Mach number regime (Mach< 2) has been computationally analyzed for the two conical interfaces. The results presented in this study have been validated by subsequent wind tunnel tests...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of a spin-flip potential at the interface between a superconductor and a ferromagnetic metal allows for the generation of equal-spin spin-triplet Cooper pairs. These Cooper pairs are compatible with the exchange interaction within the ferromagnetic region and hence allow for the long-range proximity effect through a ferromagnet or half-metal. One suitable spin-flip potential is provided by incorporating the conical magnet Holmium (Ho) into the <b>interface.</b> The <b>conical</b> magnetic structure is characterised by an opening angle α {{with respect to the}} crystal c-axis and a turning (or pitch) angle β measuring the rotation of magnetisation with respect to the adjacent layers.

30|$|The occlusal force {{does not}} load {{only on the}} screw. The {{internal}} <b>conical</b> connection <b>interface</b> also helps to transfer and distribute the loading force to the implant [13]. The axial compressive component of occlusal force during oral function causes axial displacement of the abutment to the implant connection, increasing the frictional resistance and screw joint stability of the dental implant [7, 8]. Three factors {{that may lead to}} the axial displacement of the implant-abutment connection are machining tolerance, the wedge effect, and the settling effect. Firstly, machining tolerance is a dimensional variation characteristic of machined components. The precision of every implant component varies during manufacturing due to machining tolerance [14]. Secondly, the wedge effect occurs when tightening torque or loading force is applied to the abutment [15]. The abutment acts as a wedge transferring the axial force directly to the implant. Lastly, the settling effect occurs when rough spots on the contacting surfaces of the connection are flattened under load [16]. It causes the two surfaces to come closer together and leads to axial displacement. This axial displacement causes the length of the abutment screw to shorten, diminishing the screw preload [17]. The settling effect is the main cause of screw loosening. When the abutment is fastened to the implant body with the abutment screw, a settling phenomenon occurs in which the implant body and the abutment are deformed. Even if fastened at 30 [*]N[*]cm, depending on the implant system, the loosening torque becomes smaller than the 7 to 10 % fastening torque. After 5 [*]min from this point, it is necessary to loosen it twice [18]. The degree of settling depends on the surface roughness, surface hardness, and magnitude of the tightening torque and of the occlusal loading force [16]. On the one hand, the settling effect [17] causes the axial displacement leading to the decrease of the screw preload. On the other hand, the axial displacement causes the cone connection surface adaptation providing frictional resistance and screw-joint stability [7, 8].|$|R
40|$|An {{approximate}} {{extension of}} the slender body theory {{was used to determine}} the static shape of a conically ended dielectric fluid drop in an electric field. Using induced surface charge density, hydrostatic pressure and the surface tension of the liquid with interfacial tension stresses and Maxwell electric stresses, a governing equation was obtained for slender geometries for the equilibrium configuration and numerically solved for 3 D. For an applied electric field, the electric energy on a spherical drop can be maximized in a weak dielectric by increasing the applied electric field. The minimum dielectric constant ratio needed to produce a conical end is 14. 5 corresponding to a cone angle 31. 25 °. There is a sharp increment of the aspect ratio after reaching the threshold value of the applied field strength and the deformation of the fluid drop increases with the increase in dielectric constant of the fluid drop. For a particular dielectric constant ratio, the threshold electric field producing <b>conical</b> <b>interface</b> increases with the increased surface tension of the liquid. The threshold electric field for a water drop is 1. 0854 × 104 units and the corresponding aspect ratio is 15.

40|$|The {{disintegration}} of drops in strong electric fields {{is believed to}} play an important part in the formation of thunderstorms, at least in those parts of them where no ice crystals are present. Zeleny showed experimentally that disintegration begins as a hydrodynamical instability, but his ideas about the mechanics of the situation rest on the implicit assumption that instability occurs when the internal pressure is the same as that outside the drop. It is shown that this assumption is false and that instability of an elongated drop would not occur unless a pressure difference existed. When this error is corrected it is found that a drop, elongated by an electric field, becomes unstable when its length is 1 - 9 times its equatorial diameter, and the calculated critical electric field agrees with laboratory experiments to within 1 %. When the drop becomes unstable the ends develop obtuse-angled conical points from which axial jets are projected but the stability calculations give no indication of the mechanics of this process. It is shown theoretically that a <b>conical</b> <b>interface</b> between two fluids can exist in equilibrium in an electric field, but only when the cone has a semi-vertical angle 49 - 3 ?. Apparatus was constructed for producing the necessary field, and photographs show that conical oil/water interfaces and soap films can be produced at the calculated voltage and that their semi-vertical angles are very close to 49. 3 ?.

40|$|Open AccessUsing {{hydrodynamic}} simulations, {{we study}} the mass-loss due to supernova-driven outflows from Milky Way type disc galaxies, paying {{particular attention to}} the effect of the extended hot halo gas. We find that the total mass-loss at inner radii scales roughly linearly with total mass of stars formed, and that the mass loading factor at the virial radius can be several times its value at inner radii because of the swept up hot halo gas. The temperature distribution of the outflowing material in the inner region (∼ 10 kpc) is bimodal in nature, peaking at 105 K and 106. 5 K, responsible for optical and X-ray emission, respectively. The contribution of cold/warm gas with temperature ≤ 105. 5 K to the outflow rate within 10 kpc is ≈ 0. 3 – 0. 5. The warm mass loading factor, η 3 e 5 (T ≤ 3 × 105 K) is related to the mass loading factor at the virial radius (ηv) as ηv ≈ 25 [*]η 3 e 5 [*](SFR/M⊙[*]yr− 1) − 0. 15 for a baryon fraction of 0. 1 and a starburst period of 50 Myr.

Materials and methods: A new trephination mask design with an elevated surface geometry has been proposed with a step formation between <b>conical</b> and flat <b>interfaces.</b> Two recipient masks of 7. 5 / 8. 0 mm have been manufactured and tested. The masks have outer diameter of 12. 5 mm, step formation at 10. 5 mm, and slope of conical surfaces 15 °. Its functionality has been tested in different lateral positions and tilts on a planar surface, and pig eye experiments. After successful validation on porcine eyes, new masks have been produced and tested on two patients. Results: The build-in eye tracking software of the MEL 70 was always able to capture the masks. It has been shown that the unwanted pigmentation/pattern induced by the laser pulses on the mask surface does not influence the eye-tracking efficiency. The masks could be tracked within the 18 × 14 mm lateral displacement and up to 12 ° tilt. Two patient cases are demonstrated. No complications were observed during the surgery, although it needs some attention for aligning the mask horizontally before trephination. Stability of eye tracking masks is emphasized by inducing on purpose movements of the patient head.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the thesis was to evaluate the dimensions and position of peri-implant soft tissues {{in relation to the}} topography and alterations of the bone support, and the tissues’ significance for an esthetic appreciation of implant therapy. A comparative evaluation of crown and soft tissue dimensions between implant-supported single-tooth replacements and the contra-lateral natural tooth was made in Study I. In Study II, patients´ and dentists´ judgment of the esthetic outcome of implant-supported single-tooth replacements was assessed and compared by means of a questionnaire in which various esthetic-related variables were addressed. Longitudinal changes in tooth/implant relationship and bone topography adjacent to single implants with a micro-threaded, conical marginal part were evaluated in Study III. In Study IV, bone alterations around implants with a <b>conical</b> implant-abutment <b>interface</b> were evaluated longitudinally in relation to implant-tooth and inter-implant distances. Furthermore, peri-implant soft and hard tissue alterations from the time of implant placement were longitudinally evaluated in a 3 -year prospective study involving patients receiving implant-supported fixed partial dentures (Study V). Despite differences in clinical crown height and soft tissue topography between the implant-supported single-tooth replacement and the contra-lateral natural tooth (Study I), patients’ satisfaction with the appearance of their single implant-supported crown restoration was high, whereas prosthodontists rated the esthetic outcome significantly lower (Study II). Soft tissues topography and crown form influenced the dentists´ overall satisfaction with the esthetic appearance, while no specific factors could be identified with regard to the patients’ satisfaction. Hence, factors considered by professionals to be of significance for the esthetic result of restorative treatment may not be of decisive importance for the patient. The marginal bone level at the teeth adjacent to single implants with a micro-threaded conical marginal part was not influenced by the horizontal or vertical tooth-implant distance (Study III). Observed continuous eruption of the adjacent teeth with infra-occlusal positioning of the implant restoration might cause esthetic dissatisfaction. Loss in the bone crest height in the inter-implant areas was influenced by bone loss at bordering implants and horizontal inter-unit distance, but no such relationship was proven for the proximal area between the implant and the tooth (Study IV). Soft and hard tissue changes around implant-supported fixed partial dentures took place primarily during the first 6 months after the one-stage implant installation surgery (Study V). Significant explanatory factors for the loss in proximal bone crest height at 3 years were horizontal inter-unit distance and peri-implant bone level change. The presence of a tooth next to the implant had a positive influence on the topography of the inter-unit soft tissues and the maintenance of the proximal bone crest level...|$|R
40|$|Stationary phase {{solutions}} for the radiation patterns of borehole sources are commonly used to study the far-field seismic wavefields produced in crosshole or reverse VSP experiments, but they break down when the formation shear wave velocity {{is less than the}} tube wave velocity in the source borehole. This is because the tube wave, not the primary source, radiates the dominant shear wave signal in the form of large amplitude conical waves, which are also called Mach waves. I model this effect by considering the tube wave to be a moving secondary point source generated by the primary source of acoustic energy. A discretization of the source well allows a numerical solution of the integral equation which yields the displacement field by a general source distributed in space and time. The time at which each point source in the discretization emits energy is determined by the group velocity of the tube wave, while the radiation of the individual sources is characterized by the stress field induced by the tube wave at the borehole wall. An integration along the borehole of these point sources then yields the observed Mach wave arrivals. Since this method involves the summation of shear wave ray arrivals from the many point sources along the borehole, the method is called the Ray Summation Method (RSM). Comparison of RSM results with full waveform synthetic seismograms computed with the discrete wavenumber method confirms the accuracy of this method. Unlike the discrete wavenumber method, however, the use of ray tracing in the RSM allows computation of the Mach wave arrivals for inhomogeneous layered media as well as homogeneous models, including the waves generated by reflections of the Mach waves at interfaces and from the reflections of the tube wave itself. The interactions of the <b>conical</b> waves with <b>interfaces</b> can show unusual patterns of arrivals which would not be predicted from ordinary point source behavior.

40|$|AbstractHigh {{strength-to-weight ratio}} of {{non-ferrous}} alloys, such as aluminium, magnesium and titanium alloys, {{are considered to}} be possible replacement of widely accepted steels in transportation and automobile sectors. Among these alloys, magnesium is self explosive and titanium is costlier, and aluminium is most likely to replace steels. Application of aluminium or its alloys is also thought of as an appropriate replacement in defence field, especially to enhance the easiness in mobility of combat vehicles while maintaining the same standard as that of conventional armour grade steels. Hence most of the investigations have been confined to aluminium or its alloys as base material and open an era of developing the newer composite materials to address the major limitation, i. e. tribological properties. The surface composites can be fabricated by incorporating the ceramic carbides like silicon carbide, carbides of transition metals and oxides of aluminium using surface modification techniques, such as high energy laser melt treatment, high energy electron beam irradiation and thermal spray process which are based on fusion route. These techniques yield the fusion related problems, such as interfacial reaction, pin holes, shrinkage cavities or voids and other casting related defects, and pave the way to need of an efficient technique which must be based on solid state. Recently developed friction stir processing technique was used in the present investigation for surface modification of AA 7075 aluminum alloy, which is an alternative to steels. In the present investigation, 160  μm sized boron carbide powder was procured and was reduced to 60  μm and 30  μm using high energy ball mill. Subsequently these powders were used to fabricate the surface composites using friction stir processing. Ballistic performance testing as per the military standard (JIS. 0108. 01) was carried out. In the present work, an analytical method of predicting the ballistic behavior of surface composites was developed. This method was based on energy balance, i. e., the initial energy of impact is same as that of energy absorbed by multi layers. An attempt also has been made to validate the analytical results with the experimental findings. Variation between the analytical and experimental results may be accounted due to the assumptions considering such as isotropic behavior of target and shearing area of contact as cylindrical instead of <b>conical</b> <b>interface</b> As the analytical model yields the ballistic performance in the closer proximity of experimentally obtained, it can be considered to be an approximation to evaluate the ballistic performance of targets...|$|E

Este estudo foi aprovado pelo comitê de ética no ensino e pesquisa em animais da Faculdade de Odontologia de Bauru, recebendo o protocolo de número 03 / 2008. Foram instalados 42 implantes em sete cães, sendo 14 do tipo hexágono externo (Osseotite - 3 i, USA) e 28 do tipo Cone Morse (Titamax EX CM Neodent, Brazil), todos receberam componentes protéticos, seguindo o protocolo de carga imediata, após 4 meses, todos os animais foram sacrificados e as amostras coletadas e processadas pelo sistema Exakt. Para a avaliação do direcionamento das fibras colágenas foram avaliadas 18 amostras, que foram observadas em um microscópio óptico, sobre a influência de luz polarizada. No grupo hexágono externo foram encontradas fibras colágenas oriundas do epitélio {{alveolar}} correndo paralelamente a superfície do implante e seu componente protético, em algumas amostras se uniam a outros grupos de fibras e se direcionavam a região das roscas do implante. Foram encontradas fibras que poderiam ser classificadas como perpendiculares em apenas 3 amostras, localizadas abaixo da plataforma protética, não foram observados sinais de inserção das fibras nas regiões do cilindro de proteção ou componente rotético, apenas abaixo da plataforma do implante. Ao redor das amostras do grupo cone morse, foram encontrados grupos de fibras que corriam paralelamente a superfície do componente protético, em direção a plataforma do implante. Em 6 amostras deste grupo, foram observadas fibras que foram classificadas como obliquas ou perpendiculares, distribuídas lateralmente a região mais profunda do componente protético, apresentando sinais de inserção, não foram observadas fibras se inserindo diretamente ao implante. Quando observamos os valores correspondentes aos dois grupos avaliados, podemos observar a maior predominância de fibras classificadas como paralelas-obliquas no grupo I, com 16 amostras, duas outras amostras deste grupo poderiam ser classificadas como obliquas. No grupo III, a maior predominância das amostras se encontram classificadas como obliquas, com 11 amostras, outras 5 amostras deste grupo podem ser classificadas como obliquasperpendiculares, o grupo Cone Morse apresentou um valor de 70, 20 graus para a face vestibular e 54, 73 graus para a face lingual, o grupo Hexágono externo, apresentaram valores médios de 19, 88 graus para a face vestibular e 21, 92 graus para a face lingual.

After 4 months of healing, the animals were sacrificed and samples were collected and processed for histological evaluation by means of Exakt processing system. To assess the direction of collagen fibers, 10 samples from each group were evaluated in an optical microscope, under the incidence of polarized light. In the external hexagon group were found collagen fibers derived from alveolar epithelium running parallel to the implant and his prosthetic component, in some samples these fibers joined with other groups {{and drove to the}} implant threads. Were found Fibers that could be classified as perpendicular in only three samples, located below the implant platform, no insertion signals were observed on cylinder of protection or prosthetic component, just below the implant platform. Around the morse taper group samples were found groups of fibers that ran parallel {{to the surface of the}} prosthetic component toward the implant platform. In six samples of this group, were observed fibers that were classified as oblique or perpendicular, laterally distributed to the deepest region of the prosthetic component, showing signs of insertion, were no observed fibers inserting directly to the implant surface. When we look at the values corresponding to both groups, we can observe the predominance of fibers classified as parallel-oblique on group I, with 16 samples, two other samples of this group could be classified as oblique. On group III, the highest prevalence of the samples are classified as oblique, with 11 samples, five other samples of this group can be classified as oblique-perpendicular, the morse taper group showed a mean value of 70. 20 degrees to the buccal and 54, 73 degrees to the lingual, external hexagon group presented mean values of 19. 88 degrees to Buccal and 21. 92 degrees to lingual. Based on the methodology used and results, we conclude that the type of prosthetic interface appears to influence the behavior of the tissue and that the stability provided by the implants using <b>conical</b> <b>interface,</b> seems to allow the insertion of collagen fibers directly to the prosthetic component, providing better tissue stability and protection to the implants...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to significantly advance the fundamental understanding of the process of metal-core thermal drawing from a preform for the scalable manufacturing of metal micro/nano-particles and wires. Metal micro/nano-wires and particles, with controlled size, aspect ratio and spatial distribution, exhibit unusual mechanical, electrical, magnetic, thermal, and optical properties that are desirable for numerous applications in industry as well as for fundamental research. Thermal fibre drawing from a preform, capable of mass production of continuous and uniform glass and polymer fibers, has emerged as an advanced scalable manufacturing tool for such metal micro/nano-wires and particles. It is of tremendous scientific and technical interest to gain fundamental knowledge through theoretical and experimental studies and to explore and break the fundamental limits of the metal-core thermal drawing process. Throughout this study, material combinations of the metal Tin (Sn) core and thermoplastic Polyethersulfone (PES) cladding are used as a model system. Because the viscosity ratio between molten metal and polymer (or glass) melt is much smaller than one during normal process conditions, results obtained in this study based on Sn/PES system are expected to have useful implications for other metal/glass or metal/polymer combinations as well. Despite the fact that thermal drawing from a preform is capable of the high volume production of continuous metal microwires for numerous applications, no theoretical model can yet satisfactorily provide effective predictions of core diameter and continuity from process parameters and material properties. A long wavelength model is therefore derived aiming to fill this gap and describe the dynamics of a molten metal micro-jet entrained within an immiscible, viscous, nonlinear free-surface extensional flow. The model requires numerical data (e. g. drawing force and cladding profile) be measured in real-time. Examination of the boundary conditions reveals that the diameter control mechanism is essentially volume conservation. The flow rate of molten metal is controlled upstream while the flow velocity is controlled downstream realized by solidification of the molten metal. The dynamics of the molten metal jet is dominated by interfacial tension, stress in the cladding, and pressure in the molten metal. Taylor’s <b>conical</b> fluid <b>interface</b> solution (Taylor 1966) can be considered as a special case in this model. A dimensionless capillary number Ca= 2 Fa/(γA(0)) is suggested to be used as the indicator for the transition from continuous mode (i. e. viscous stress dominating) to dripping mode (i. e. interfacial tension dominating). Experimental results showed the existence of a critical capillary number Ca_cr, above which continuous metal microwires can be produced, providing the first-ever quantitative predictor of the core continuity during preform drawing of metal microwires. With the new understanding obtained through the fundamental studies on single-core preform drawing, experimental design and analysis on thermal drawing of micro metal wires are carried out to optimize the drawing conditions for multi-core preforms. To minimize the experimental cost and time, we made an unreplicated 23 factorial design and evaluated the effects and interactions of drawing parameters (e. g. draw-down ratio, stress at melt front, and aspect ratio) on the capillary instability and core continuity. Two numerical indicators, namely Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) and Deviation from Draw-down Ratio (DDR), were proposed as measures of the extent of growth of capillary instability and the core continuity respectively. The results indicate that all main factors considered significantly affect the RSD and DDR and the interactions between main factors are not negligible. Comparison between models fitted respectively based on RSD and DDR suggests that capillary instability may not be the only cause of core break-up, which led to the discovery of solid-state break-up. Empirical rules for optimizing parameters are derived based on the surface plots of RSD and DDR. At least at microscale domain, maximizing the stress at the melt front is believed to minimize the growth of capillary instability while maximizing the draw-down ratio tends to maximize the chance of obtaining a continuous core, given all other parameters unchanged. While previous studies focus on maintaining the continuity of the metal core during preform drawing, i. e. preventing fluid instabilities, exploratory studies were also conducted to control the wavelength of break-up by electric fields and to harness the fluid instabilities for the production of metal nanoparticles. We conducted a feasibility study on utilizing a radial electric field to control the break-up wavelength of an initially continuous microwire during preform drawing. It was hypothesized that the radial electric field significantly affects the break-up wavelength of the metal core during preform drawing. The result of an unpaired two-sample t-test confirmed the effect thus shed new light on the controlled emulsification of molten metal in a viscous dielectric medium. We then experimentally show the scalable manufacturing of metal Sn nanoparticles (< 100 nm) in Polyethersulfone (PES) fibers. The underlying mechanism for the particle formation is revealed, and a strategy for the particle diameter control is proposed. This process opens a new pathway for scalable manufacturing of metal nanoparticles from liquid state facilitated solely by hydrodynamic forces, which may find exciting photonic, electrical, or energy applications...|$|R
