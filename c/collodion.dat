5|$|Photographs of the 19th century often now {{show the}} {{limitations}} of the technology used, yet Felice Beato managed to successfully work within and even transcend those limitations. He predominantly produced albumen silver prints from wet <b>collodion</b> glass-plate negatives.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other {{techniques}} developed in parallel {{with the use of}} daguerreotypes. The ambrotype, using collodium to produce a positive image on glass, and the pannotype, also collodium-based, were both used in Denmark from around 1855. Negative-based paper prints, used {{from the beginning of the}} 1850s, were produced on salt paper until around 1857 when salt was replaced by albumen. <b>Collodion</b> emulsion chloride paper was used from 1865 and in 1880 gelatin emulsion paper was introduced.|$|E
5|$|Homing pigeons {{were used}} {{extensively}} in the 19th and early 20thcenturies, both for civil pigeon post and as war pigeons. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the famous pigeon post of Paris carried up to 50,000microfilmed telegrams per pigeon flight from Tours into the besieged capital. Altogether 150,000 individual private telegrams and state dispatches were delivered. In an 1889 experiment of the Imperial Russian Technical Society at Saint Petersburg, {{the chief of the}} Russian balloon corps took aerial photographs from a balloon and sent the developed <b>collodion</b> film negatives to the ground by pigeon post.|$|E
5|$|During {{the era of}} the <b>collodion</b> process, {{before the}} arrival of less {{demanding}} photographic technology (the gelatin silver process, photographic film, and smaller cameras) and the consequent rise of amateur photography, commercial photographers like Farsari had a particular importance for recording events and views. In Japan before 1899 such photographers were even more significant because the government required foreigners to obtain passes to journey to the interior, and commercial photographers based in Japan could more easily gain access and provide rare images of restricted areas. By 1889, however, Farsari estimated that about half of all visitors to Yokohama were amateur photographers; even if this was an exaggeration, the presence of increasing numbers of amateur photographers was obviously affecting the commercial photography business. To encourage amateur photographers to visit his studio and possibly buy his merchandise, Farsari provided free use of a darkroom.|$|E

25|$|In the March 1851 {{issue of}} The Chemist, Frederick Scott Archer {{published}} his wet plate <b>collodion</b> process. It {{became the most}} widely used photographic medium until the gelatin dry plate, introduced in the 1870s, eventually replaced it. There are three subsets to the <b>collodion</b> process; the Ambrotype (a positive image on glass), the Ferrotype or Tintype (a positive image on metal) and the glass negative, which was used to make positive prints on albumen or salted paper.|$|E
25|$|Asserting a {{very broad}} {{interpretation}} of his patent rights, Talbot declared that anyone using the <b>collodion</b> process would still {{need to get a}} calotype licence.|$|E
25|$|In 1851, {{the year}} of Daguerre's death, Frederick Scott Archer publicised the wet <b>collodion</b> process, which made it {{practical}} to use glass instead of paper as the support for making the camera negative. The lack of detail often criticised in prints made from calotype negatives was overcome, and sharp images, comparable in degree of detail to daguerreotypes, could at last be provided by convenient paper prints. The <b>collodion</b> process soon replaced the calotype in commercial use, {{and by the end}} of the decade the daguerreotype was virtually extinct as well.|$|E
25|$|On October 20, 2016 the Smithsonian Institution {{acquired}} The Real Deal, A {{wet plate}} <b>collodion</b> photograph of American former professional boxer Evander Holyfield taken by Balkowitch on February 28, 2015.|$|E
25|$|In 1856, {{seeing the}} {{tremendous}} potential for reproducible and enlarged prints and illustrated newspapers, Brady hired photographer and businessman, Alexander Gardner, who instructed {{him in the}} new art of wet-plate <b>collodion</b> photography.|$|E
25|$|In 1854, Talbot {{applied for}} an {{extension}} of the 14-year patent. At that time, one of his lawsuits, against photographer Martin Laroche, was heard in court. The Talbot v. Laroche case proved to be pivotal. Laroche's side argued that the patent was invalid, as a similar process had been invented earlier by Joseph Reade, and that using the <b>collodion</b> process did not infringe the calotype patent in any case, because of {{significant differences between the two}} processes. In the verdict, the jury upheld the calotype patent but agreed that Laroche was not infringing upon it by using the <b>collodion</b> process. Disappointed by the outcome, Talbot chose not to extend his patent.|$|E
25|$|On April 6, 2016, Balkowitsch gave a Tedx {{talk at the}} University of Mary that {{discussed}} the history of <b>collodion</b> photography and examined the impact of modern technology on photographs {{in relation to the}} evolution of how people create and preserve photographs.|$|E
25|$|Later Oliver {{became a}} printer and photographer, specializing in nineteenth century {{processes}} such as <b>collodion</b> and Woodburytype. His work has been displayed in museum and gallery exhibitions and used in films. In 2007, his book A History of the Woodburytype was published by Carl Mautz Publishing.|$|E
25|$|Mercury(II) {{chloride}} {{was used}} as a photographic intensifier to produce positive pictures in the <b>collodion</b> process of the 1800s. When applied to a negative, the mercury(II) chloride whitens and thickens the image, thereby increasing the opacity of the shadows and creating the illusion of a positive image.|$|E
25|$|KCN {{is used as}} a {{photographic}} fixer in the wet plate <b>collodion</b> process. The KCN dissolves silver where it has not been made insoluble by the developer. This reveals and stabilizes the image, making it no longer sensitive to light. Modern wet plate photographers may prefer less toxic fixers, often opting for the less toxic Sodium thiosulphate, but KCN is still used. Also used as snake repellent by Koreans.|$|E
25|$|While recuperating in England and {{receiving}} treatment from Sir William Gull, Muybridge {{took up the}} new field of professional photography sometime between 1861 and 1866. Muybridge later stated that he had changed his vocation {{at the suggestion of}} his physician. He learned the wet-plate <b>collodion</b> process in England, and may have been influenced by some of the great English photographers of those years, such as Julia Margaret Cameron. Also during this period, Muybridge secured at least two British patents for his inventions, including the design of a high speed electrical shutter and electro-timer, to be used alongside a battery of up to 24 cameras.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Joseph Russell (1829–1902), {{was born}} in Walpole, New Hampshire, the son of Harriet (née Robinson) and Joseph Russell. He was raised in Nunda, New York. He took an early {{interest}} in painting, {{and in addition to}} executing portraiture for local public figures, he was drawn to railroads and trains. During {{the first two years of}} the Civil War, Russell painted a diorama used to recruit soldiers for the Union Army. On 22 August 1862, he volunteered at Elmira, New York, mustering in the following month as a captain in Company F, 141st New York Volunteer Regiment. In February 1863, Russell, who had become interested in the new art of photography, paid free-lance photographer Egbert Guy Fowx $300 to teach him the wet-plate <b>collodion</b> process.|$|E
25|$|It must be observed, however, that {{in order}} to find the real {{intensity}} ratio, the diameter of the actual working aperture must be ascertained. This is easily accomplished in the case of single lenses, or for double combination lenses used with the full opening, these merely requiring the application of a pair of compasses or rule; but when double or triple-combination lenses are used, with stops inserted between the combinations, it is somewhat more troublesome; for it is obvious that in this case the diameter of the stop employed is not the measure of the actual pencil of light transmitted by the front combination. To ascertain this, focus for a distant object, remove the focusing screen and replace it by the <b>collodion</b> slide, having previously inserted a piece of cardboard in place of the prepared plate. Make a small round hole in the centre of the cardboard with a piercer, and now remove to a darkened room; apply a candle close to the hole, and observe the illuminated patch visible upon the front combination; the diameter of this circle, carefully measured, is the actual working aperture of the lens in question for the particular stop employed.|$|E

500|$|During an 1861 Royal Institution {{lecture on}} colour theory, Maxwell {{presented}} the world's first demonstration of colour photography by this principle of three-colour analysis and synthesis. Thomas Sutton, {{inventor of the}} single-lens reflex camera, took the picture. He photographed a tartan ribbon three times, through red, green, and blue filters, also making a fourth photograph through a yellow filter, which, according to Maxwell's account, was not used in the demonstration. Because Sutton's photographic plates were [...] insensitive to red and barely sensitive to green, {{the results of this}} pioneering experiment were far from perfect. It was remarked in the published account of the lecture that [...] "if the red and green images had been as fully photographed as the blue," [...] it [...] "would have been a truly-coloured image of the riband. By finding photographic materials more sensitive to the less refrangible rays, the representation of the colours of objects might be greatly improved." [...] Researchers in 1961 concluded that the seemingly impossible partial success of the red-filtered exposure was due to ultraviolet light, which is strongly reflected by some red dyes, not entirely blocked by the red filter used, and within the range of sensitivity of the wet <b>collodion</b> process Sutton employed.|$|E
500|$|Dickson and his then lead assistant, Charles Brown, made halting {{progress}} at first. Edison's original idea involved recording pinpoint photographs, 1/32 {{of an inch}} wide, directly on to a cylinder (also {{referred to as a}} [...] "drum"); the cylinder, made of an opaque material for positive images or of glass for negatives, was coated in <b>collodion</b> to provide a photographic base. An audio cylinder would provide synchronized sound, while the rotating images, hardly operatic in scale, were viewed through a microscope-like tube. When tests were made with images expanded to a mere 1/8 of an inch in width, the coarseness of the silver bromide emulsion used on the cylinder became unacceptably apparent. Around June 1889, the lab began working with sensitized celluloid sheets, supplied by John Carbutt, that could be wrapped around the cylinder, providing a far superior base for the recording of photographs. The first film made for the Kinetoscope, and apparently the first motion picture ever produced on photographic film in the United States, may have been shot at this time (there is an unresolved debate over whether it was made in June 1889 or November 1890); known as Monkeyshines, No. 1, it shows an employee of the lab in an apparently tongue-in-cheek display of physical dexterity. Attempts at synchronizing sound were soon left behind, while Dickson would also experiment with disc-based exhibition designs.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1990s, Mann began photographing landscapes on {{wet plate}} <b>collodion</b> 8x10 inch glass negatives, {{and used the}} same 100 year-old 8x10 format bellows view camera that she had used for all the {{previous}} bodies of work. These landscapes were first seen in Still Time, and later featured in two shows presented by the Edwynn Houk Gallery in NYC: Sally Mann – Mother Land: Recent Landscapes of Georgia and Virginia in 1997, and then in Deep South: Landscapes of Louisiana and Mississippi in 1999. Many of these large (40"x50") black-and-white and manipulated prints were taken using the 19th century “wet plate” process, or <b>collodion,</b> in which glass plates are coated with <b>collodion,</b> dipped in silver nitrate, and exposed while still wet. This gave the photographs what the New York Times called “a swirling, ethereal image with a center of preternatural clarity," [...] and showed many flaws and artifacts, some from the process and some introduced by Mann.|$|E

2500|$|The Mask Series {{was started}} by Shane Balkowitsch in 2012 after taking a very simple <b>collodion</b> image of a vintage Czech M10 gas mask and a wilting flower. He called the plate 'The Last Flower'. The goal for this series is to raise {{awareness}} of the historic wet plate technique as an art form. [...] This will allow artists that normally do not have a chance to share their work to participate in a collaborated effort with other artists from around the world. Once an artist decides to participate and take up the challenge of creating an original work, [...] a gas mask is sent to them. [...] The artist then produces a wet plate <b>collodion</b> image of any size or type that works best for them. The Series is expected to be completed in 2017.|$|E

Invented by Alexander Parkes, this celluloid {{is credited}} by the London Science Museum to be [...] "generally accepted {{as the first}} plastic". (This presumably refers to synthetic plastic formed into objects: it is predated by the 1848 <b>collodion,</b> a nitrocellulose-based solution that dries to a celluloid-like film but is useless for industrial purposes, (as well as several natural plastics).|$|E

2500|$|In 1854, James Ambrose Cutting and his partner, Isaac A. Rehn, {{took out}} three patents that were [...] "improvements" [...] in the wet-plate <b>collodion</b> process. Cutting {{developed}} {{a method for}} adhering the two pieces of glass together using Canada balsam. Though meant {{as a way to}} hermetically seal the ambrotypes as a preservation method, the process was ultimately unnecessary as the varnish layer itself worked extremely well as a protectant. In fact, ambrotypes that utilized Cutting's patent are known to exhibit deterioration caused by the technique. Numerous high-profile lawsuits (E. Anthony, J. Gurney, C.D. Fredericks, J. Bogardus) and disputes surrounding the patents may have had an intimidating effect, and discouraged a wider use of [...] "instantaneous" [...] (stop action) photography during the Civil War. Cutting's patented formula featured the chemical component, bromide of potassium, which greatly enhanced the sensitivity of the <b>collodion.</b> When the patent extensions came up for renewal in 1868, the Patent Office decided that the original patents should not have been issued, and the extension was denied. The decision was partly based on evidence found in Henry Snelling's book, [...] "The History and Practice of Photography." [...] Snelling in 1853 had described the use of the same key ingredients found in Cutting's high-speed, emulsion.|$|E

On a return trip to England in 1860, he {{suffered}} serious head injuries in a stagecoach crash in Texas. He spent {{the next few years}} recuperating in England, where he took up professional photography, learning the wet-plate <b>collodion</b> process, and secured at least two British patents for his inventions. He went back to San Francisco in 1867, and in 1868 his large photographs of Yosemite Valley [...] made him world-famous.|$|E
2500|$|Mann's seventh book, Proud Flesh, {{published}} in 2009, {{is a study}} taken over six years {{of the effects of}} muscular dystrophy on her husband Larry Mann. Mann photographed her husband using a cumbersome process that dates back to the 1850s. A <b>collodion</b> wet plate, creating a large formatted negative image on film not glass. As she notes, [...] "The results of this rare reversal of photographic roles are candid, extraordinarily wrenching and touchingly frank portraits of a man at his most vulnerable moment." [...] The project was displayed in Gagosian Gallery in October 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Mann’s sixth book, Deep South, {{published}} in 2005, with 65 black-and-white images, includes landscapes taken from 1992 to 2004 using both conventional 8x10 film and wet plate <b>collodion.</b> These photographs {{have been described}} as “haunted landscapes of the south, battlefields, decaying mansion, kudzu shrouded landscapes and the site where Emmett Till was murdered." [...] Newsweek picked it as their book choice for the holiday season, saying that Mann “walks right up to every Southern stereotype in the book and subtly demolishes each in its turn by creating indelibly disturbing images that hover somewhere between document and dream." ...|$|E
2500|$|Le Plongeon {{pioneered the}} use of {{photography}} {{as a tool for}} his studies. He began using the wet <b>collodion</b> glass-plate negative process he used for studio portraits to record his explorations. He traveled extensively all over Peru for eight years visiting and photographing ancient ruins, including Tiahuanaco. Augustus also joined a number of E. G. Squier's expeditions and took photographs out in the field. Le Plongeon was influenced by the work of Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg, [...] John Lloyd Stephens, and Frederick Catherwood. These works, in combination with his own explorations in Peru, led Le Plongeon to believe that civilization had its origins in the New World.|$|E
2500|$|Photographic plates preceded {{photographic}} {{film as a}} means of photography. A light-sensitive emulsion of silver salts was applied to a glass plate. This form of photographic material largely faded from the consumer market {{in the early years of}} the 20th century, as more convenient and less fragile films were introduced. The wet <b>collodion</b> process was replaced by dry plates at the start of the 1870s. The mechanical production of dry photographic plates were invented by George Eastman who filed U.S. patent #226,503 on September 9, 1879, for (in his own words [...] "An Improved Process for Preparing Gelatine Dry-Film Plates") which was issued to him on April 13, 1880.|$|E
