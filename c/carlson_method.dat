40|$|A {{series of}} sonic boom flight tests were {{conducted}} by the US Air Force at Edwards AFB in 1987 with current supersonic DOD aircraft. These tests involved 43 flights by various aircraft at different Mach number and altitude combinations. The measured peak overpressures to predicted values {{as a function of}} lateral distance are compared. Some of the flights are combined into five groups because of the varying profiles and the limited number of sonic booms obtained during this study. The peak overpressures and the lateral distances are normalized with respect to the <b>Carlson</b> <b>method</b> predicted centerline overpressures and lateral cutoff distances, respectively, to facilitate comparisons between sonic boom data from similar flight profiles. It is demonstrated that the data agrees with sonic boom theory and previous studies and adds to the existing sonic boom database by including sonic boom signatures, tracking, and weather data in a digital format...|$|E
40|$|Floating fishery net (keramba) {{activity}} in Sipin Lake Jambi has increased {{significantly in the}} last decade. This intensive fishery results in enrichment of phosphate due to the application of fish feeding and induces eutrophication. The objectives {{of this study are}} to determine phosphate enrichment, the trophic status using TSI <b>Carlson</b> <b>method</b> and to propose a model of phosphate enrichment in the lake water. TSI Carlson is a method to determine the trophic status condition in the water body. Composite water samples were collected at up-, downstream and middle of the lake. Total phosphate content, chlorophyl-a, and brightness were measured. The results show that the average of total phosphate, chlorophyl-a, and brightness of the lake water are 0. 0505 mg/L, 5. 86 μg/L and 58 cm, respectively. These figures indicate that fishery net activity has induced eutrophication with phosphate enrichment of 9. 65 T/yr. A proposed TSI Carlson model estimates the TSI value would be 61. 79 within next ten years with phosphate enrichment of 12. 04 T/yr. Application of double fishery nettings (keramba) would be expected to reduce these figures and the risk of eutrophication in the lake...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{article focuses}} on {{enterprise}} inflation expectations in Slovakia. Firstly, we propose a quantitative measure for enterprise inflation expectations based on results derived from the business tendency survey. The probability <b>method</b> (<b>Carlson</b> and Parkin <b>method)</b> is used for this purpose. Secondly, we proceed to test two specific models of enterprise inflation expectations formation in Slovakia – the rationality assumption model and the hybrid model assuming that inflation expectations can be partially forward-looking and partially backward-looking. Finally, we assess if the transmission of inflation expectations from one sector to another one can exist. Our analysis is conducted for companies operating in industry, construction, retail trade and services. Seasonally adjusted data from January 2002 (beginning of the business tendency surveys in Slovakia) to May 2015 are used, although some tests are done specifically for the post-euro introduction period (from January 2009) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the measurement error of conversion {{methods used to}} convert survey data to a quantitative index, especially the Carlson and Parkin (1975) method. When we want to summarise economic conditions using a numerical value, we often {{have to depend on}} survey data and convert them to a quantitative index. However, because survey research restricts responses into specific classifications and respondent’s response density may not be uniform, survey data surely include a specific error. In addition, because the distribution assumed in the Carlson–Parkin method may not fit the respondent’s distribution, this may also produce measurement error. This paper computes the measurement error of the <b>Carlson</b> and Parkin <b>method</b> in order to clarify its properties by Monte Carlo simulation. First, this paper finds that the "balance approach" contains significant error. Second, the error is large when true inflation expectations are large. Third, the error can be decreased by increasing the number of respondents. Fourth, changes in the response classification do not bring about dramatic changes compared with {{an increase in the number}} of respondents.

40|$|Soil {{moisture}} plays a {{key role}} in the hydrological cycle. Because of its heterogeneous distribution satellite measurements can be favourable for arriving at mean areal values. For bare soil such values of soil moisture can be derived from active microwave measurements. However a commonly recognised method for estimating soil moisture under vegetation using remote sensing data does not exist at present. <b>Carlson</b> proposed a <b>method</b> to estimate soil moisture of the upper layer under the vegetation. This method involves using VIS-, NIR-, and TIR data and simulations of a Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere-Transfer (SVAT) -model. The original method is enhanced and tested in theory and practical application. Comparison of derived soil moisture with field measurements shows good agreement. It is shown that microwave measurements can be included in the analysis in a meaningful way...|$|R
40|$|In {{this section}} a more unified {{research}} effort in family assessment is advocated by Dr. Halverson. He urges the constructs {{most important in}} the study of families be identified by shifting from the study of isolated components of the family to a more global view of family functioning. There is a lack of attention to the nomological net of constructs. Multi-trait and multi-method analysis is recommended to produce useful information regarding the family. Dr. Carlson continues this critique by highlighting the influential role of theory in the development and use of family assessment measures and <b>methods.</b> <b>Carlson</b> traces the development of family assessment by discussing the influences of sociology, systems/ communication theory, ecological psychology, social learning theory, and the emerging influences of behavioral genetics, developmental psychology, the close relationships model, and the social relations model...|$|R
40|$|Gyda is {{a mature}} oil field {{located in the}} North Sea. Gyda is {{experiencing}} challenges with declining oil production and increasing water-cut. A study of the EOR potential on the Gyda field is performed. A review of conventional EOR methods is performed. Based Gyda EOR requirements, a WAG injection simulation study is performed to evaluate the increased oil recovery potential from WAG injection. The simulation study is performed on Eclipse 300 Compositional Reservoir simulator. A black oil dynamic reservoir model is received for this thesis and the conversion from black oil to compositional modeling is described. Hysteresis effects on the relative permeability of gas during WAG injection are evaluated. Killough s, Carlson s and WAG hysteresis option in Eclipse are evaluated. Stone s first and Stone s second method for defining three-phase relative permeability curves are compared to each other. Stone s first method is chosen to create the three-phase relative permeability curves, and <b>Carlson</b> s <b>method</b> is chosen to capture the hysteresis effects on the relative permeability of gas during WAG injection. WAG cycles sensitivities are run. Simulations show that WAG cycle periods of six months are beneficial {{when there is a}} substantial distance between injector and producer. Shorter WAG cycles are beneficial when producer and injector are closer and have good communication. WAG cycle lengths are not critical for the ultimate oil recovery. WAG injection on Gyda with dry injection gas can increase the recovery by 1. 4 % by 2021. Including gas relative permeability hysteresis gives more optimistic prediction for WAG injection studies...|$|R
40|$|A 1 -year {{cycle of}} physico-chemical {{measurements}} {{was conducted in}} the Marano and Grado Lagoon (Adriatic Sea, Italy) with the aim to assess its trophic state. Some selected variables (nutrients, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, temperature and salinity) were {{used to describe the}} system within the application of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and to compare it with other Mediterranean environments. From an ecological point of view the Marano and Grado Lagoon {{is one of the best}} conserved wetlands in the whole Mediterranean area and is protected by several European environmental pieces of legislation. However, the neighbouring mainland hosts several socio-economic activities which can affect its water quality. The results obtained in this work highlighted considerable spatial and temporal variability of physico-chemical parameters. Specifically, a large amount of anthropogenic nutrients, mainly in form of nitrogen (N), was carried from inland through river discharges in the Marano basin (western sector). However, these inputs were offset by the water exchange with the adjacent open sea, which exerted a dynamic dilution effect, and induced low water residence time thus limiting nutrients enrichment and their accumulation for long time periods. The Molar Redfield ratio (DIN/SRP) was always higher than the optimum value of 16 (in some cases it was up to 2000), thus suggesting that the system is phosphorus (P) limited, as confirmed by low chlorophyll a content, rare algal blooms and good water oxygenation. Trophic state indices and threshold values (EEA <b>method,</b> <b>Carlson</b> Trophic Index, TRIX and ASSETS) were applied. A broad range of classes was found (from oligotrophic to hypertrophic depending on water bodies, method applied and period of the year), thus suggesting that an over simplification of this complex ecosystem should be avoided. Further studies will be conducted in order to define the Lagoon's ecological status sensu WFD and the adequate management implications...|$|R
