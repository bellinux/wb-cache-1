2500|$|Electrostatic induction, {{discovered}} by British scientist John Canton in 1753 and Swedish professor Johan Carl Wilcke in 1762 is a redistribution of charges in an object {{caused by the}} electric field of a nearby charge. [...] For example, if a positively charged object is brought near an uncharged metal object, the mobile negatively-charged electrons in the metal will be attracted the external charge, {{and move to the}} side of the metal facing it, creating a negative charge on the surface. [...] When the electrons move out of an area they leave a positive charge due to the metal atoms' nuclei, so the side of the metal object facing away from the charge acquires a positive charge. These induced charges disappear when the external charge is removed. [...] Induction is also responsible for the attraction of light objects, such as balloons, paper scraps and styrofoam packing peanuts to static charges. [...] The surface charges induced in conductive objects exactly cancel external electric fields inside the conductor, so there is no electric field inside a metal object. [...] This is the basis for the electric field shielding action of a Faraday cage. [...] Since the electric field is the gradient of the voltage, electrostatic induction is also responsible for making the electric potential (voltage) constant throughout a <b>conductive</b> <b>object.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{conductor}} can be levitated above an electromagnet (or vice versa) with an {{alternating current}} flowing through it. This causes any regular conductor {{to behave like}} a diamagnet, due to the eddy currents generated in the conductor. Since the eddy currents create their own fields which oppose the magnetic field, the <b>conductive</b> <b>object</b> is repelled from the electromagnet, {{and most of the}} field lines of the magnetic field will no longer penetrate the <b>conductive</b> <b>object.</b>|$|E

25|$|Additional {{precautions}} must {{be taken}} to prevent side-flashes between <b>conductive</b> <b>objects</b> on or in the structure and the lightning protection system. The surge of lightning current through a lightning protection conductor will create a voltage difference between it and any <b>conductive</b> <b>objects</b> that are near it. This voltage difference can be large enough to cause a dangerous side-flash (spark) between the two that can cause significant damage, especially on structures housing flammable or explosive materials. The most effective way to prevent this potential damage is to ensure the electrical continuity between the lightning protection system and any objects susceptible to a side-flash. Effective bonding will allow the voltage potential of the two objects to rise and fall simultaneously, thereby eliminating any risk of a side-flash.|$|R

5000|$|Capacitance occurs {{between any}} two {{conductors}} separated by an insulator. In an audio cable, capacitance occurs between the cable's two conductors; the resulting losses are called [...] "dielectric losses" [...] or [...] "dielectric absorption".

5000|$|The {{electrostatic}} potential or voltage between two points {{is defined as}} the energy (work) required to move a small charge through an electric field between the two points, divided {{by the size of the}} charge.

Thus the {{electrostatic potential}} energy of the charge will increase. So the potential at point [...] is higher than at point [...] The electric field [...] at any point is the gradient (rate of change) of the electrostatic potential [...] : Since there can be no electric field inside a <b>conductive</b> <b>object</b> to exert force on charges , within a <b>conductive</b> <b>object</b> the gradient of the potential is zero [...] Another way of saying this is that in electrostatics, electrostatic induction ensures that the potential (voltage) throughout a <b>conductive</b> <b>object</b> is constant.|$|E

50|$|Notably, a {{combination}} of footwear with some sole materials, low humidity, and a dry carpet (synthetic fiber in particular) can cause footsteps to charge a person's body capacitance {{to as much as}} a few tens of kilovolts with respect to the earth.

5000|$|If an {{electrical}} conductor touches {{the outside of}} the globe, capacitive coupling can induce enough potential on it to produce a small arc. This is possible because the globe's glass acts as a capacitor dielectric: the inside of the lamp acts as one plate, and the <b>conductive</b> <b>object</b> on the outside acts as the opposite capacitor plate. [...] This is a dangerous action which can damage the globe or other electronic devices, and presents a fire ignition hazard.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the surface}} of the {{material}} is now electrically charged, either negatively or positively, any contact with an uncharged <b>conductive</b> <b>object</b> or with an object having substantially different charge may cause an electrical discharge of the built-up static electricity: a spark.

50|$|In a varying {{magnetic}} field the induced currents exhibit diamagnetic-like repulsion effects. A <b>conductive</b> <b>object</b> will experience a repulsion force. This can lift objects against gravity, though with continual power input {{to replace the}} energy dissipated by the eddy currents. An example application is separation of aluminum cans from other metals in an eddy current separator. Ferrous metals cling to the magnet, and aluminum (and other non-ferrous conductors) are forced away from the magnet; this can separate a waste stream into ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal.|$|E
5000|$|An {{eddy current}} brake, like a {{conventional}} friction brake, is a device used to slow or stop a moving object by dissipating its kinetic energy as heat. However, unlike electro-mechanical brakes, {{in which the}} drag force used to stop the moving object is provided by friction between two surfaces pressed together, the drag force in an eddy current brake is an electromagnetic force between a magnet and a nearby <b>conductive</b> <b>object</b> in relative motion, due to eddy currents induced in the conductor through electromagnetic induction.|$|E
