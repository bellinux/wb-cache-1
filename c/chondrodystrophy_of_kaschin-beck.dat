40|$|Now, {{there is}} a {{decreasing}} trend for the prevalence rate <b>of</b> <b>Kaschin-Beck</b> disease (KBD) {{in most parts of}} China, but the disease is still active and severe in the Tibetan Plateau for some reason. To further explore the role of selenium in the occurrence of KBD, We collected samples including drinking water, cultivated topsoil, Highland Barley grains, and tsamba in Rangtang County and Aba County, Sichuan Province and determined concentrations of selenium by Hydride Generation Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry. Levels of selenium in the environment were analyzed in detail. Selenium in the soil-plant-food system and their relationship with prevalence rate of KBD were also discussed. The results indicate: (a) the levels of environmental selenium are very low and the study area belongs to a selenium-deficient ecological landscape; (b) the KBD becomes much more severe with decreasing environmental selenium under the selenium-deficient condition. Namely, the lower the environmental selenium is, the more severe the disease is; (c) soil selenium deficiency plays a critical role for the prevalence of local KBD, and more factors inducing selenium deficiency should be more concerned in the future...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectiveBased on the {{aetiological}} hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>Kaschin–Beck</b> disease (KBD), different interventions were adopted, and the preventive {{and therapeutic}} effects of interventions was observed and evaluated in this trial. DesignA total of 358 children from seven villages of Qinghai Province in China were examined, and 280 children aged 6 – 11 years old {{were eligible for}} the trial. The children were divided into three groups that received either no intervention (n =  64), 150  kg/person of rice from non-KBD areas (n =  103) or 7  kg/family of selenium–iodine salt (n =  113) for 12 months. Data were collected and {{used to calculate the}} proportion of patients with X-ray lesions, the proportion of new patients and the metaphyseal repair rate. All indicators were analysed with Pearson chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. The registration number of this trial is ChiCTR-PNRC- 12002309 ([URL] interventions, the proportion of patients with X-ray lesions increased dramatically in the control group and decreased significantly in two intervention groups; significant differences were seen between the control group and two intervention groups (P <  0. 05). Moreover, significant differences were observed in the proportions of new patients and the metaphyseal repair rates between the control group and two intervention groups (P <  0. 05). Additionally, the proportion of new patients was lowest and the metaphyseal repair rate was highest in group B. ConclusionsThe effects of eating rice from non-KBD areas and selenium supplementation on the prevention and treatment of paediatric KBD were notable, the consumption of rice might be the most effective and safest intervention and should be encouraged...|$|R

Soil samples including the surface layer (0 - 20 cm) and the subsurface layer (20 - 40 cm) in the cultivated and natural soil profiles were collected, and the mechanical composite and total concentration of arsenic, cobalt, copper, iron, mercury, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc were determined. Concentrations of arsenic, iron, manganese, copper, and selenium in the surface soil were lower than those in the subsurface soil. The same was true of physical clay in the soil profiles. However, {{there were no significant differences}} between the different soil layers. The concentrations of selenium, molybdenum, and mercury were somewhat lower compared with the average concentrations of soils in China. Deficiencies of molybdenum and selenium both play a critical role in occurrence of KBD, but whether or not soil mercury at a low level contributes to KBD is still unclear. A correlation analysis of soil elements showed that there is a positive correlation between iron, cobalt, and manganese due to their similar chemical characteristics. Selenium concentrations in soil as well as the physical clay and iron descend with the deterioration of KBD, but mercury concentrations in soil ascend with the aggravation of the disease. The results show that selenium deficiencies greatly influence the disease, and a deficiency of molybdenum is likely another important factor in inducing KBD. Moreover, determining whether low levels of soil mercury contribute to KBD should be investigated in the future...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{new form}} <b>of</b> <b>chondrodystrophy</b> was {{observed}} in an inbred line of large weight white turkeys. It is characterized by shortened and thickened long bones of the legs and wings and proportionally shortened beaks. The absence of some terminal phalanges was noted in {{about half of the}} mutants. A hydrocephalous condition {{was observed in}} a few mutants but was not found in normal embryos. The chondrodystrophy is caused by an autosomal recessive semi-lethal gene designated chm. Only three chm chm individuals have hatched normally but others have been assisted out of the shell and have survived for varying periods of time. Of six that survived to mature age, all were sterile. A slightly different form <b>of</b> <b>chondrodystrophy</b> was observed in medium-weight turkeys from three sources. This type, which did not have the missing phalanges or hydrocephalic expression, was also caused by a recessive gene which was different from chm. Phenotypically, they differed from s s embryos (Asmundson, 1944) by shortening of the beak and failure to hatch...|$|R
40|$|A case control {{study was}} {{conducted}} on 46 farms in south eastern Australia with a recent history <b>of</b> congenital <b>chondrodystrophy</b> <b>of</b> unknown origin (CCUO) between 2002 and 2007. For each farm data was collected using face-to-face interviews concerning the management of case and control mobs during the gestation period in which affected calves were born. Data concerning the paddocks in which gestating cattle were maintained was also collected for analysis. Three separate multivariable models were constructed using generalised linear mixed models (GLMM). The first model {{was based on the}} dichotomous outcome of mob status (affected/not affected) and included explanatory variables for management and environment factors. The second model used a novel approach, taking into account the number of cases in affected mobs in order to utilise available data. The outcome events/ trials was used where the numerator was equal to the number of affected calves in a mob, and the denominator was equal to the total number of calves in the mob. The third model used the dichotomous outcome paddock status and included environmental and soil variables for paddocks involved with case and control mobs. Confounding for dam age and year affected was included in the mob outcome models, and random effects for paddock and farm were incorporated into the models. The birth of CCUO calves was associated with dams grazing native pastures on hilly terrain during gestation. Low levels of pasture were also associated with the outcome. The two models used for the mob outcome were similar in many respects. The events/trial model included the use of supplemental feed and an interaction term. This study demonstrates an association between a maternal nutritional disturbance and the occurrence of CCUO.

Under these observations the author confirmed the following results. 1) The attack rate of this disease in each district is parallel to the percentage of the disease on the nativeborns, not on all inhabitants. 2) It takes two of five years until this disease is clinically manifested. (the stage of incubation). 3) Only persons who have lived in the endemic district since childhood are afflicted by the disease. 4) As younger the afflicted persons are as more severe is the development of this disease. 5) The Koreans suffer from this disease as well as the Manchurians. So the cause of this disease is independent from the different mode of life between the two races. 6) The lower the standard of living is, the higher is the percentage of this disease. So the condition of the nutrition seems to be a secondary cause of this disease. 7) Certain conditions of the soil are the most important factor of the development of this disease. 8) This disease is not infectious and not inherited. ・) The disturbance of internal secretion of salivary glands is the definite factor to the development of this disease. 10) The inhabitants of this epidemic district are dying, for the most part, in the presenile stage owing to the combination of the angina vasomotorica, that is Kokuzan disease...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{management}} of California Condors aims {{to maximize the}} retention of genetic diversity by minimizing mean kinship within the population. Analysis of multi-locus DNA fingerprinting data identified 3 groups consisting of closely related individuals (clans) within the population. These findings were utilized to create a hypothetical previous generation of California Condors that were designated as founders and utilized for population management calculations and recommendations. We used a series of tetranucleotide microsatellite repeat loci to improve resolution of relationships and re-evaluate genetic relatedness among individuals obtained from the wild. These new results may alter kinship estimations and thus genetic management recommendations. We also have identified a genetic form <b>of</b> <b>chondrodystrophy</b> (dwarfism) in condors {{that appears to be}} inherited as an autosomal recessive allele. Taking advantage of recent progress in genome studies of domestic chickens, we are developing a genetic map of the California Condor.

To address genome research and genetic management of California condors, we have begun to develop genetic, cytogenetic and comparative maps as a prerequisite for identification of candidate loci for the chondrodystrophy mutation. We produced a highly redundant California condor genomic BAC library that was used to construct a first-generation chicken-condor comparative physical map and to identify specific condor BACs carrying candidate genes for chondrodystrophy.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) A form <b>of</b> {{congenital}} <b>chondrodystrophy</b> <b>of</b> unknown origin (CCUO), {{often referred}} to in Australia as acorn calf disease, was reported irregularly in beef cattle in south-eastern Australia until 2001, {{with the exception of}} an extended outbreak in NSW in 1991 and two isolated reports from Western Australia in 1992. A notable increase in reports of affected calves since 2002 raised serious concern about the cost of this condition to affected producers, and about the possibility of CCUO being an emerging condition. The case definition of a calf with CCUO used throughout this project was a calf from a clinically well dam showing signs of disproportionate dwarfism at birth including limb deformities (bowed legs, shortened limbs, enlarged joints or arthrogryposis), superior brachygnathia (domed head and/or dished face) and spinal deformities (lordosis, kyphosis and scoliosis). This project was a direct response to an industry request for research to progress the understanding of the epidemiology of CCUO in Australia, in particular its geographic and temporal distribution and risk factors associated with CCUO occurrence. A nation-wide survey of rural veterinarians combined with data from published reports provided the most complete description of the spatio-temporal distribution of CCUO in Australia to date. The data demonstrated an increase in CCUO occurrence since 2002, with reports each year involving multiple farms. While the majority of these farms were in south-eastern NSW and north-eastern Victoria, a trend towards more cases outside this focus region was evident, with reports from areas previously thought to be CCUO-free in Western Australia and South Australia. This survey identified some cases not included in official records, indicating that some farmers affected by CCUO do not report the birth of affected calves. Under-reporting of CCUO means that even this study does not fully depict the level and distribution of affected farms in southern Australia. The estimated direct income loss for farmers arising from the 1081 CCUO calves reported for the period 2002 to 2007 totaled AU 818 315, with an average loss per affected calf of AU 757. A case-control study involving 46 affected farms from the focus region of south-eastern NSW and north-eastern Victoria showed all affected mobs from 2002 to 2007 calved during spring, and found significant associations between the birth of CCUO calves in a mob and four management and environment variables that link either directly or indirectly with poor maternal nutrition during gestation. The birth of CCUO calves was more likely when: •	dams had grazed in paddocks with inadequate amounts of pasture •	dams had grazed in a paddock with the main pasture type being native or mixed pasture compared to improved pasture •	dams had grazed in a paddock with predominately hilly to steep terrain •	dams were given a supplement feed (variable included in one final model). This last finding was contrary to expectation but most likely reflects that mobs fed a supplement were those experiencing the most extreme nutritional stress and that the supplement provided was insufficient to meet requirements for normal foetal development. Similar to the results for mobs, analysis of the case-control data to examine associations between the birth of CCUO calves in a paddock and the environment and soil characteristics of the paddock found significant associations with the two environment variables listed above related to main pasture type and paddocks with predominately hilly to steep terrain. This further confirmed the direct or indirect link with poor maternal nutrition during gestation. The results for paddocks also found a significant association between increased soil potassium and the birth of CCUO calves in a paddock. This finding was unexpected as potassium has not been shown to affect other trace minerals in vivo. However, a dietary excess of potassium has been shown to produce mild metabolic alkalosis and affect calcium homeostasis. At this point the potential role for potassium in the development of CCUO calves is not understood. Notably the investigation of soil variables in this case-control study found no association with soil levels of the suspect trace minerals manganese and zinc, or with any other mineral such as iron, that might alter the availability of these trace minerals. Association of the birth of CCUO calves with periods of drought on the 46 study farms was investigated using time series analysis based on historical climate records. CCUO occurrence was associated with drought five months before calving, corresponding to the 2 nd to 4 th months of gestation for spring-calving herds on the 46 farms during 2002 to 2007. In this study drought was defined as a three-month period in which rainfall was within the first decile (that is, the lowest 10...|$|R
