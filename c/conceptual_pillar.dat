40|$|Rock pillar {{strength}} and the characterisation of pillar failure mechanisms are of major importance in mine design. The recently developed Synthetic Rock Mass (SRM) approach provides a state-of-the-art numerical technique to more accurately characterize the mechanical properties of rock pillars. The SRM approach used in this thesis {{is based on a}} combination of two well accepted numerical methods, a Particle Flow Code (PFC 3 D) incorporating a Discrete Fracture Network (DFN). This research presents the results of a systematic study of the use of SRM modelling for hard rock pillars. The effect of assumed joint set characteristics (orientation and persistence) is first investigated through comparison of the numerical results from a series of <b>conceptual</b> <b>pillar</b> models. The joint set properties are shown to have important controls on the pillar peak strength, deformation modulus, lateral stiffness and the pillar strain-softening gradient in the post-peak stage. The effect of pillar confinement is then examined using two <b>conceptual</b> <b>pillar</b> models with varied slenderness (Width/Height ratio). The pillar confinement effect is investigated by comparing the axial and lateral stresses at the pillar core and pillar boundaries, and this effect attributed to the lateral restraint due to the loading platens. The confinement effect is further examined using a series of triaxial compression test simulations in which the pillar peak strength, residual {{strength and}} post-peak strain-softening gradient are quantified. Simulations of the development of 3 D cracks in two jointed pillar models, including wing cracks, large scale crack coalescence and step path failure are presented. A 3 D visualisation of internal pillar failure mechanisms is illustrated by examining crack development and the changes in the localised stresses within the pillar model. Research presented will contribute significantly {{to the development of a}} more robust SRM approach for rock pillar design...|$|E

The purpose is {{to point out the}} <b>conceptual</b> <b>pillars</b> and contribute to the ongoing debate on: how knowledge assets impact organizational performance, what are the characteristics of such value‐generating processes, what factors affect the process of building organizational capabilities and distinctive competences, and how organizations translate specific capabilities into sustainable competitive advantages. Design/methodology/approach – The article is based on a thorough analysis of the management literature addressing the nature, role and relevance of knowledge, organizational capabilities, learning and knowledge management for organization competitiveness. The conceptual background sets the foundations for {{a better understanding of the}} strategic importance of knowledge‐based value drivers for innovation and sustainable organizational value creation. Findings – As knowledge management is establishing itself as a research discipline, it is fundamental to define the <b>conceptual</b> <b>pillars</b> grounding the application of knowledge management initiatives for innovation and business performance improvements. This paper provides a framework summarizing the key assumptions at the basis of understanding the strategic relevance of knowledge‐based value drivers for growth and competitiveness. Research limitations/implications – In addressing some of the questions posed, this article provides some implications for future research that build on different perspectives and emphasize the importance of adopting multi‐disciplinary approaches to disentangle the complexities of how organizations convert knowledge resources to a long‐lasting competitive advantage.

Besides being {{closely related to}} human dignity {{and the right to}} life, health is fundamental to poverty reduction, human development and economic growth. In parallel, the development dimension is a <b>conceptual</b> <b>pillar</b> in the health policy discourse as basic levels of social welfare and economic development are of fundamental importance to the achievement of the fullest attainable standard of health. Since foreign direct investment is deemed to promote economic development, it is clear that in abstract terms the linkage between foreign investment and public health may endorse positive outcomes. However, when countries pursue economic growth, their policy makers may have an incentive to lower health standards to promote foreign direct investment. By the same token, foreign investors may be attracted by lower standards in existing regulations to externalize the health related costs which are associated to their business. In addition, countries may not want to adopt higher standards of health protection because of potential investor-state disputes. The mere possibility of such a dispute concerning regulatory measures alleged to have negative effects on foreign property may have a chilling effect on policy makers. The clash between a state’s responsibility to protect public health and its obligations to promote free trade has been broadly discussed by authors. 1 What is lacking is an in depth analysis of the relationship between public health and international investment law. In this respect, there are two questions which arise when considering such a connection. What impact have investment treaties on public health in the host states and to what extent may investment treaty obligations collide with states’ obligations to protect public health? Is investor-state arbitration a suitable forum to protect public interests? This thesis aims at providing a fresh approach to these questions. It attempts to systematically review international investment law in the light of public health. While previous contributions have dealt with the interplay between international investment law and human rights law, 3 this thesis offers an in depth analysis of the almost unexplored linkage between international investment law and public health...|$|E
40|$|R&D policy instruments, such as {{subsidies}} and tax incentives, have the objective to increase private firms R&D investments, {{and hence the}} economic performance and competitiveness of national innovation systems. Norway, like many other OECD countries, has an active R&D policy that aims at increasing the R&D intensity of the economy. The tax-incentive scheme SkatteFUNN, active since 2002, {{is one of the}} major R&D policy programmes supported by the Norwegian Government. The recent literature on R&D policy evaluation investigates the effects that tax incentive schemes have on firms innovation efforts, and typically points out the existence of a positive impact on companies R&D expenditures (input additionality) and technological performance (output additionality). However, much less attention has so far been devoted to the study of the motivations that drive firms to apply to these R&D programmes, as well as other effects that these may have on firms strategies and capabilities in a broader sense (so-called behavioural additionality). Another limitation of this literature is that it is mostly represented by quantitative studies that focus on the average effect of R&D policy for the whole economy, without paying attention to the extent to which these effects differ across firms. Firm heterogeneity is a key <b>conceptual</b> <b>pillar</b> in innovation studies, and it is reasonable to expect that the impacts of R&D policy vary substantially depending on companies capabilities and knowledge base. Motivated by these gaps in extant literature, this thesis presents a qualitative analysis of the Norwegian tax-credit scheme SkatteFUNN, that has the objective to investigate firms motivations and behavioural additionality effects, and how these differ for different groups of firms and in different sectors. In a comparative case study analysis, I collected interview and survey questionnaire data on 20 Norwegian firms that have recently received SkatteFUNN support for some of their R&D projects. These 20 companies were selected from the population of SkatteFUNN approved projects, provided by the Norwegian Research Council, according to three criteria: (i) their previous experience with R&D (experienced vs. non-experienced firms), (ii) the sectoral context in which they operate (high- vs. low-R&D sectors) (iii) their size (large vs. SMEs). The results indicate that the motivation to apply to SkatteFUNN varies with R&D experience: firms with prior experience are more likely to apply in order to reduce the costs of their R&D projects or increase their scale, while firms without prior R&D experience are more motivated to apply in order to secure necessary funds to initiate new R&D projects. Regarding behavioural additionality, the firms with no prior R&D activity were found to have experienced the strongest change to their behaviour, since the SkatteFUNN support made it possible for them to set up a new technological strategy and hence build up new routines and capabilities. On the whole, the thesis concludes that heterogeneity plays an important role: firms responses to R&D policy programmes differ substantially, and this dimension should be taken into due account when designing and evaluating this type of policy schemes...|$|E

40|$|Governing social-ecological systems, such as {{the urban}} water commons, is a multi-scale and {{multi-sector}} (polycentric) human-environment process. This dissertation interrogates this process by situating itself within the Ecology of Games Framework by Norton Long (and updated by Mark Lubell) and the literature on polycentric governance by the Bloomington School of Political Economy. The dissertation’s three essays 1) offer both theoretical and methodological means to enact polycentric public economies within the ecology of games framework, and 2) explicate {{the conditions under which}} interoganizational collaboration is fostered within a polycentric ecology of policy games in governing the Middle Rio Grande urban watershed. First, it deploys a synthesized theoretical construct which puts into conversation three theoretical paradigms to excavate the <b>conceptual</b> <b>pillars</b> to study the polycentricity of urban water governance in the United States. A novel conceptual tool is hereby constructed to help engage the thoughts that polycentricity is not the antithesis of monocentricity but the co-constitution of actors at multiple governing scales and within multiple sectors. Second, the <b>conceptual</b> <b>pillars</b> are reworked into theoretical and methodological models to study the polycentricity of governing the Middle Rio Grande (MRG) urban watershed in New Mexico, USA. Four indices are developed to measure the level of political, market, nonprofit, and overall polycentricity in governing this urban water commons. Employing multiple methods like the social network analysis, social-ecological network analysis (SENA), and regression analysis, the dissertation’s findings suggest that polycentric water governance could primarily be about the politics of power and resource distribution, the reconfigurations of actors’ positionalities as they align themselves and their interests strategically. This, among other findings in the dissertation, points to the need to centralize the politics of power and resource distribution in the study of polycentricity in social-ecological governance. Third and finally, the overall polycentric index is used to model the role of polycentricity in interorganizational collaboration within the Middle Rio Grande (MRG) urban water commons. The exponential random graph models (ERGMs) is used in this analysis. Among other findings, the results show that polycentric governance increases the probability of interorganizational collaboration within the MRG. The implications of the dissertation’s three cohesive essays to theory, methods and policy are discussed in the conclusion chapter of the dissertation. In all, this dissertation concludes that there is still no panacea in governing the (urban water) commons...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the design, analysis and implementation of preconditioning con-cepts for spectral DG discretizations of elliptic boundary value problems. The far term goal is to obtain robust solvers for the “fully flexible ” case. By this we mean Discontinuous Galerkin schemes on locally re-fined quadrilateral or hexahedral partitions with hanging nodes and variable polynomial degrees that could, in principle, be arbitrarily large only subject to some weak grading constraints. In this paper, as a first step, we focus on varying arbitrarily large degrees while keeping the mesh geometrically conforming since this will be seen to exhibit already some essential obstructions. The conceptual foundation of the envisaged preconditioners is the auxiliary space method, or in fact, an iterated variant of it. The main <b>conceptual</b> <b>pillars</b> that will be shown in this framework to yield “optimal ” preconditioners are Legendre-Gauß-Lobatto grids in connection with certain associated anisotropic nested dyadic grids. Here “optimal ” means that the preconditioned systems exhibit uniformly bounded condition numbers. Moreover, the preconditioners have a modular form that facilitates somewhat simplified partial realizations at the expense of a moderate loss of efficiency. Our analysis is complemented by careful quantitative experimental studies of the mai...|$|R

This appraisal of the Georgescu-Roegen's work emphasizes the emergence of the entropic nature of the economic processes as a paradigm à la Kuhn of explanation in social economics. Design/methodology/approach – This work provides a critical assessment of the entropic model's main <b>conceptual</b> <b>pillars,</b> namely the role of mathematical formalism and the natural imagery of irreversibility. This discussion takes them in turn and develops a critique from a methodological point of view. Findings – The focus of this work is that the proposed epistemological reconstruction of economics is vulnerable to attacks from two methodological objections. The first deals with the change of metaphor from the “pendulum” of mechanics to the “hourglass” of thermodynamics. The second refers to the changes this replacement of metaphors brings about as to the relevance of the formalism of the discipline. Originality/value – This material has gathered arguments to show that the intellectual concurrence of the arguments onto the field of physics makes the methodological value of the new paradigm of entropy not transcend into a new logic of reasoning in economics. The limits of this approach stems from the same rationale for which it has got its revolutionary stature: what it proposes consists of a scientific discourse based on a mixture of evolutionary biology, economics and thermodynamics, which may open up new original and insightful perspectives, but which has never been justified on terms of economic nature alone.

40|$|Adaptive {{resource}} management is a learning-by-doing approach to natural {{resource management}}. Its effective practice involves the activation, completion, and regeneration of the "adaptive management cycle" while working toward achieving a flexible set of collaboratively identified objectives. This iterative process requires application of single-, double-, and triple-loop learning, to strategically modify inputs, outputs, assumptions, and hypotheses linked to improving policies, management strategies, and actions, along with transforming governance. Obtaining an appropriate balance between these three modes of learning {{has been difficult}} to achieve in practice and building capacity in this area can be achieved through an emphasis on reflexive learning, by employing adaptive feedback systems. A heuristic reflexive learning framework for adaptive resource management is presented in this manuscript. It is built on the <b>conceptual</b> <b>pillars</b> of the following: stakeholder driven adaptive feedback systems; strategic adaptive management (SAM); and hierarchy theory. The SAM Reflexive Learning Framework (SRLF) emphasizes the types, roles, and transfer of information within a reflexive learning context. Its adaptive feedback systems enhance the facilitation of single-, double-, and triple-loop learning. Focus on the reflexive learning process is further fostered by streamlining objectives within and across all governance levels; incorporating multiple interlinked adaptive management cycles; having learning as an ongoing, nested process; recognizing when and where to employ the three-modes of learning; distinguishing initiating conditions for this learning; and contemplating practitioner mandates for this learning across governance levels. The SRLF is a key enabler for implementing the "adaptive management cycle," and thereby translating the theory of adaptive resource management into practice. It promotes the heuristics of adaptive management within a cohesive framework and its deployment guides adaptive resource management within and beyond typical single-loop learning, across all governance levels...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} group-level dynamics {{in the field of}} signed language interpretation. Groups are us/them categorizations involving insider/outsider identities and memberships. The diagnostic interpretation presented here comes from the situated perspective of a professional ASL/English interpreter, an outsider who entered the field by chance and has spent the last twenty years trying to discern why intercultural communication using simultaneous interpreting appears to be so rife with contention. Theoretically, this is a story of intercultural encounter and organizational development informed by anti-audist, anti-oralist and pro- Deafhood sensibilities. The goal {{of this article is to}} propose three, action learning “hypotheses” to be considered by interpreter educators as <b>conceptual</b> <b>pillars</b> for a comprehensive pedagogical framework that reinvigorates the original Deaf invention of community interpreting. “Although underexplored,” Stone (2009) demonstrates conclusively that “a translation norm exists within the Deaf community” (p. 172). The three hypotheses presented here seek to inspire collective reflection among stakeholders involved or concerned with simultaneous interpretation. Action learning describes one kind of relationship between an individual (e. g., a researcher, trainer, student, or participant/interlocutor) and knowledge. Action learning involves continuous, experiential cycles of investigation, comprehension, reevaluation, and new/revised comprehension among stakeholders (Kolb, 1984). In this case, several research methodologies have been merged, including participant-observation, critical discourse analysis, ethnographic action research, and some critical participatory action research. Patterns of discourse and social interaction that hold across multiple research sites have yielded the following tentative suggestions for growing the 1 Kent Published by Journal of Interpretation prominence of signed languages, Deaf peoples, and the intercultural communication practice of simultaneous interpretation. 1 The three hypotheses are presented separately as discrete proposals with specific supporting evidence; however, they are responsive to a composite cluster of inter-related phenomena. Untangling such interrelations is an interpretive task that goes beyond description— the logic used here involves distinguishing levels of social interaction and some of the discursive and cultural effects of language use. The two threads that tie these interdependent social phenomena together are time and ghostwriting (Adam, Carty, 2 ̆ 6 Stone, 2011), especially as the Australian-Irish Deaf culture tradition of ghostwriting is invoked in the professional performances of American Deaf interpreters (Forestal, 2011) and elaborated upon as a Deaf translation norm by Deaf British translator/interpreters in broadcast television (Stone, 2009). The reemergence of Deaf interpreters has been described as “shifting positionality” (Cokely, 2005 b, p. 3). This shift is from a position of dependence or oppression to one of empowerment and agency. Observable “resistance among hearing interpreters to chang[ing] how they [work]” (Forestal, 2011, p. 134) is, I argue, a “parallel process” (Alderfer 2 ̆ 6 Smith, 1982) that mirrors the resistance of interlocutors (especially non-deaf interlocutors) to working with interpreters at all. The theoretical claim is that temporality is neglected in most reflection and research about simultaneous interpreting because it has been taken for granted that the speed of information transfer is a highly significant and non-negotiable measure of effective interpretation. For instance, four of the eleven (73...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the late}} 1990 s, {{there has been}} a marked {{increase}} in academic interest in what are sometimes referred to as ‘utility films’: audio-visual texts intended not so much for the entertainment of an audience, but rather to inform it, train it or teach it a specific skill, or to convince it of the merits of a given service or product. This attention is long overdue, because such items form part of the collective memory of several generations of viewers – much like the feature films that {{have been part of the}} media studies canon for decades. However, the research carried out so far is somewhat restricted in scope: it primarily concerns the history of production and distribution, and questions concerning pedagogical or entrepreneurial success. Much less attention has been given to the films’ textual features: the means they deploy in defending their informational, educational or commercial argument. In the absence of such studies, the image survives of very ‘formulaic’ genres, which are thought to make use of a very limited number of (highly recognisable) textual ingredients. The purpose of this dissertation is to modify this picture. The starting point for the research is a collection of (Dutch) classroom teaching films: a corpus of shorts designed to be used in support of the lesson programme of children in primary and early secondary schools. The analytical method employed is based on two <b>conceptual</b> <b>pillars.</b> The first is that films function, and therefore acquire meaning, as part of a wider configuration: the set-up of technology, text and viewing situation that some media theorists designate as a ‘dispositif’. In the case of teaching films, the screening is inextricably intertwined with the educational institution in which it takes place; therefore, this set-up is designated here as a ‘pedagogical dispositif’. The second pillar is that of textual implication, derived from the study of literary texts. Analysis in this work is based on the assumption that the rhetorical functioning of films is always a matter of somehow incorporating into the text itself the audience addressed. The dissertation consists of two parts. The first, introductory section serves the purpose of positioning the study’s research object. It explores the concept of ‘teaching film’, both in a historical sense and in a theoretical one; subsequently, it (re) delimits it, with an eye to the rhetorical analysis that follows. The second part aims to find an answer to the question of how teaching films address their viewers. It starts off with a methodological section, which explains among others how the term ‘rhetoric’ is understood. Next, there are two analytical chapters. The first deals with the ways in which teaching films motivate their viewers to stay tuned (addressing them, in the process, as film viewers), and the second gives examples of so-called ‘references to the pedagogical dispositif’ (textual elements which help position the audience as one of learners, or pupil-viewers). The latter type of features, the dissertation also argues, do not occur in all (the) teaching films (discussed), but tend become more common over time...|$|R
40|$|O trabalho O ato suicida e sua falha traz como questão central, a partir do escopo psicanalítico, o estatuto de ato do suicídio e o a posteriori de sua falha. Aposta-se na possibilidade de abordagem pela via da psicanálise de um fato que pode se manifestar de forma extrema e disruptiva e que, em um primeiro momento, aproxima-se daquilo que se caracteriza por uma extração considerável de palavra. Segue-se assim o objetivo de estruturar um campo conceitual orientado por Freud e Lacan, desde o qual se torna hábil organizar a questão acerca do momento do ato suicida e o estatuto disto que falha. Dada a {{amplitude}} dessa problemática, busca-se, por meio de uma redução encaminhada pela seleção de elementos específicos, traçar um percurso que permite situar uma teoria freudiana do suicídio que toma como pontos de firmamento o campo do ato e a metapsicologia da melancolia. Na sequência, tendo como pontos balizadores o Seminário, livro 10 A angústia (1962 - 63) e o Seminário, livro 15 O ato psicanalítico (1967 - 68), considera-se o suicídio circunscrito por Lacan aos parâmetros do ato pela conceituação de passagem ao ato e {{acting out}}. A hipótese de uma teoria freudiana do suicídio, firmada sobre os pilares conceituais de ato e melancolia, tem como eixo aquilo que escapa ao que é da ordem do representável e que se apresenta como um insuportável. Assim, recorre-se a Lacan com o objetivo de aprofundar esta problemática defendendo uma continuidade teórica entre a teoria freudiana do suicídio e a conceituação de passagem ao ato e acting out desde a asserção do objeto a. Este insuportável que perpassa a teoria freudiana do suicídio como da ordem de um irrepresentável encontra na conceituação lacaniana de objeto a um articulador. Este objeto como protagonista é definidor de uma temporalidade em que são diferenciados o momento do ato, do triunfo do a, e o depois em que o Outro se espraia como horizonte e onde o sujeito se reposiciona. É neste horizonte que a falha do ato pode ser viabilizada enquanto significante e isso apenas pode ser feito por aquele que sobre isso fala. Propõe-se que o ato suicida só pode ser valorado tal como pelo sujeito que, após a ruptura, se posiciona frente a seu ato e tem a possibilidade de então se implicar de maneira singularThe thesis T̈he suicidal act and its failureb̈rings as its central proposition, from the psychoanalytic scope, the suicidal act statute and the posteriori of its failure. It {{is considered the}} possibility of an approach through Psychoanalysis of a fact which can manifest in an extreme and disruptive way and that, at first, approaches what is characterized by a considerable words extraction. It is followed by the objective of structuring a theoretical field oriented by Freud and Lacan, from which enables it to organize the question regarding the suicidal act and its statute that fails. In consideration of such extent of this problematics, it is aimed, supported by a reduction directed by the selection of specific elements, to delineate a journey which allows locating a Freuds theory of suicide that considers as cornerstones the field of the act and the metapsychology of melancholy. Further, setting as landmarks the Seminar, book 10 The Anguish (1962 - 63) and the Seminar, book 15, - The Psychoanalytic act (1967 - 68), it is considered the suicide conditioned by Lacan to the act parameters by conceptualization of passage to the act and acting out. The hypothesis of a Freudian theory of suicide, consolidated over the <b>conceptual</b> <b>pillars</b> of act and melancholy, has its axis on that which escapes to what belongs to the representable range and which presents itself as unbearable. Therefore, Lacan is called upon aiming to deepen this problematics advocating a theoretical continuity between Freuds theory of suicide and the passage to the act and acting approach starting with the object a proposition. This unbearableness which permeates Freuds suicide theory in the order of a non representable encounters an articulator at Lacans concept of object a. This object as protagonist determines a temporality in which are differentiated the moment of the act, the triumph of a, and the afterwards in which the Other spreads as horizon and where the subject repositions itself. It is within this horizon that the act failure can be enabled as significant and only this can be executed by the one who speaks about it. It is proposed that the suicidal act can only be valued as such by the subject who, after the disruption, positions himself towards his act and has the possibility of at that time imply himself in a unique wa...|$|R

Its hand has touched almost all facets of human existence, it being slow, slight and singular in some cases yet rapid, multiple and irrevocable in others. High school curriculum development has also felt its impress as well. The western provinces have recognized and responded to the call for change with the Western Canadian Protocol - Common Curriculum Framework; closer to home the impetus for change in curriculum direction, development, and documents has been answered through the formulation and gradual implementation of the Atlantic Provinces Education Foundation document. It is within the pages of this document that new directions and reconceptualizations take shape that will serve to inform the teaching of English language arts for the new millennium. [...] For the most part, this shape and direction has been a theoretical one, specifically that of literary theory. With the explosion {{of the new}} continental literary theories and their subsequent graft and maturation, this field has been a decided mover and shaker in not only the realm of the academy but, particularly of late, in the world of high school curriculum development. The philosophies and methodologies of movements and schools such as critical literacy, semiotics, deconstruction, cultural studies, etc. are those that now serve to form some of the key <b>conceptual</b> and structural <b>pillars</b> of the English language arts classroom. The presence, role, and practical application of such theories in current curriculum frameworks, particularly the APEF, necessitate an examination of this theoretical territory and its inherent consciousness in the APEF. It also necessitates a proposal utilizing the integration and synthesis of said theories, resulting ultimately in workable practices for the English language arts classroom; applications borne of, circumscribed by, and adherent to critical literacy and multiple sign systems. [...] Critical literacy, itself, is an approach to teaching English language arts that is characterized by eclecticism and dichotomy, and draws its fuel and fire from postmodern theoretical stances. Transactions through multiple sign systems utilizes an application of Gardiner's Multiple Intelligences through Reader-Response Theory, specifically the American development of Rosenblatt termed aesthetic transactive theory. Such reshaping, refashioning, and reconceptualizing, evident in curriculum development, is no less evident within the APEF where its designers have sought and wrought new directions and innovations for the 21 st century, theoretically grounded in literary theory. It is also clearly evident that these new directions and shifts embrace the philosophy behind critical literacy and transactions through multiple sign systems.

Its hand has touched almost all facets of human existence, it being slow, slight and singular in some cases yet rapid, multiple and irrevocable in others. High school curriculum development has also felt its impress as well. The western provinces have recognized and responded to the call for change with the Western Canadian Protocol - Common Curriculum Framework; closer to home the impetus for change in curriculum direction, development, and documents has been answered through the formulation and gradual implementation of the Atlantic Provinces Education Foundation document. It is within the pages of this document that new directions and reconceptualizations take shape that will serve to inform the teaching of English language arts for the new millennium. [...] For the most part, this shape and direction has been a theoretical one, specifically that of literary theory. With the explosion of the "new" continental literary theories and their subsequent graft and maturation, this field has been a decided mover and shaker in not only the realm of the academy but, particularly of late, in the world of high school curriculum development. The philosophies and methodologies of movements and schools such as critical literacy, semiotics, deconstruction, cultural studies, etc. are those that now serve to form some of the key <b>conceptual</b> and structural <b>pillars</b> of the English language arts classroom. The presence, role, and practical application of such theories in current curriculum frameworks, particularly the APEF, necessitate an examination of this theoretical territory and its inherent consciousness in the APEF. It also necessitates a proposal utilizing the integration and synthesis of said theories, resulting ultimately in workable practices for the English language arts classroom; applications borne of, circumscribed by, and adherent to critical literacy and multiple sign systems. [...] Critical literacy, itself, is an approach to teaching English language arts that is characterized by eclecticism and dichotomy, and draws its fuel and fire from postmodern theoretical stances. Transactions through multiple sign systems utilizes an application of Gardiner's Multiple Intelligences through Reader-Response Theory, specifically the American development of Rosenblatt termed aesthetic transactive theory. Such reshaping, refashioning, and reconceptualizing, evident in curriculum development, is no less evident within the APEF where its designers have sought and wrought new directions and innovations for the 21 st century, theoretically grounded in literary theory. It is also clearly evident that these new directions and shifts embrace the philosophy behind critical literacy and transactions through multiple sign systems. [...] It is to such perceived shifts in the accepted order that Thomas Kuhn coined the term paradigm; it is to such shifts that the students of Newfoundland and Labrador will be introduced to a new paradigm {{under the aegis of the}} APEF and its inherent literary theories...|$|R
