Unlike prior studies of <b>Costa</b> <b>Rican</b> vocal music, which have focused upon the use(s) composers made of indigenous folk elements, this study identifies foreign, non-indigenous elements that were introduced into <b>Costa</b> <b>Rican</b> vocal music by musical pioneers such as Julio Fonseca (1885 - 1950) and Dolores Castegnaro (1900 - 1979), composers who studied at various times in Italy, Belgium, France and Mexico. Excerpts of their music have been analyzed for this document to demonstrate specific international influences. Another two composers were selected due to their present importance in <b>Costa</b> <b>Rican</b> music: Eddie Mora and Marvin Camacho. In a very distinctive manner, these composers bring to the musical environment of <b>Costa</b> <b>Rican</b> diversity and exoticism in Eddie Mora's case and a mix of contemporary with <b>Costa</b> <b>Rican</b> elements with Marvin Camacho's music. In analyzing the music of these four composers, this research intends to present the different influences of other countries into <b>Costa</b> <b>Rican</b> music while Marvin Camacho brings back its own <b>Costa</b> <b>Rican</b> voice...|$|R

I argue that Costa Rica’s national identity formation depends upon the racialization of “exceptional” political, economic, and social achievements, thereby drawing the boundaries of national belonging and citizenship according to certain features of race, gender, and class.
