2500|$|The Switch is {{primarily}} powered in portable mode by a non-removable 4310 mAh, 3.7 V Lithium-ion rechargeable battery. The battery life {{is estimated to}} be between 2.5 and 6.5 hours, depending on the software being used. Nintendo gives the example of [...] supporting approximately three hours of battery life.

Later models included both an AAUI and modular <b>connector</b> <b>port</b> for directly connecting 10BASE-T; either could be used, but not both at the same time.

5000|$|HDCP {{can cause}} {{problems}} for users {{who want to}} connect multiple screens to a device; for example, a bar with several televisions connected to one satellite receiver or when a user has a closed laptop and uses an external display as the only monitor. HDCP devices can create multiple keys, allowing each screen to operate, but the number varies from device to device; e.g., a Dish or Sky satellite receiver can generate 16 keys. The technology sometimes causes handshaking problems where devices cannot establish a connection, especially with older high-definition displays. Edward Felten wrote [...] "the main practical effect of HDCP has been to create one more way in which your electronics could fail to work properly with your TV," [...] and concluded {{in the aftermath of}} the master key fiasco that HDCP has been [...] "less a security system than a tool for shaping the consumer electronics market." [...] Additional issues arise when interactive media (i.e. video games) suffer from control latency, because it requires additional processing for encoding/decoding. Various everyday usage situation, such as live streaming or capture of game play, are also adversely affected. There is also the problem that all Apple laptop products, presumably in order to reduce switching time, when confronted with an HDCP compliant device, automatically switch all output from the DVI / Mini DisplayPort / Thunderbolt <b>connector</b> <b>port</b> to HDCP compliant. This is a problem if the user wishes to record or use videoconferencing facilities further down the chain, because these are inherently forbidden by HDCP. This applies even if the output is not HDCP work, like a PowerPoint presentation.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the sensor}} unit was {{originally}} planned {{to contain a}} microprocessor that would perform operations such as the system's skeletal mapping, it was revealed in January 2010 that the sensor would no longer feature a dedicated processor. Instead, processing would be handled {{by one of the}} processor cores of Xbox 360's Xenon CPU. According to Alex Kipman, Kinect system consumes about 10-15% of Xbox 360's computing resources. However, in November, Alex Kipman made a statement that [...] "the new motion control tech now only uses a single-digit percentage of Xbox 360's processing power, down from the previously stated 10 to 15 percent." [...] A number of observers commented that the computational load required for Kinect makes the addition of Kinect functionality to pre-existing games through software updates even less likely, with concepts specific to Kinect more likely to be the focus for developers using the platform.On March 25, 2010, Microsoft sent out a save the date flier for an event called the [...] "World Premiere 'Project Natal' for Xbox 360 Experience" [...] at E3 2010.

Case reportA patient with sick sinus syndrome underwent implantation of a 5 mm unipolar atrial lead, mated to a 5 / 6 mm <b>connector</b> <b>port</b> Medtronic Spectrax Sx 5985 pacemaker.

She was admitted in 2010 for atrial lead non capture from blood leak and corrosion of the header-connector pin apparatus. Discussion 5 / 6 mm pacemaker header ports have a 5 mm flexible sealing ring at the port entrance to seal 5 mm or 6 mm lead connector pins. The inner barrel diameter of the <b>connector</b> <b>port</b> is 6 mm and insertion of a 5 mm lead results in a 0. 5 mm tolerance circumferentially. Should the seal be compromised, blood can corrode the apparatus. To minimize this, we can employ (a) a cinching tie to further seal the silicone ring (b) universal adaptor sleeves (c) splice kits (d) lead adaptor kits. Aging leads, adaptor kits or sleeves themselves can result in lead failure. It may be safer to re-implant the entire system. ConclusionA 5 / 6 mm configuration pacemaker header <b>connector</b> <b>port</b> allows for significant tolerances when a 5 mm lead is used. Consideration {{must be made to}} prevent leaks...|$|E

40|$|The NCN 9252 is a DP 3 T switch for {{combined}} UART and USB 2. 0 high−speed data applications. It allows portable {{systems to}} use a single external port to transmit and receive signals to and from three separate locations within the portable system. It is comprised of two switches, each with a single common I/O that alternates between 3 terminals. They are operated together to allow three data sources, such as a USB or UART transceiver, to pass differential data through a shared USB <b>connector</b> <b>port.</b> The NCN 9252 features low RON − 4 � (max) at 4. 2 V VCC, 5 � (typ) at a 3. 3 V VCC. It also features low CON, < 30 pF (max) across the supply voltage range. This performance makes it ideal for both USB full−speed and high−speed applications that require both low RON and CON for effective signal transmission. The NCN 9252 is capable of accepting control input signals down to 1. 4 V, over a range of VCC supply voltages with minimal leakage current. The NCN 9252 is offered in a Pb−Free, 12 pin, 1. 7 x 2. 0 x 0. 5 mm, UQFN package...|$|E
40|$|Access to the pre-beamform data of each array {{channel on}} an {{ultrasound}} scanner {{is important to}} experimental investigations on advanced imaging research topics like adaptive beamforming and synthetic aperture imaging. Through such data access, we can obtain in-vitro or in-vivo insights on various imaging methods without resorting to hardware implementation. This paper reports {{the development of a}} pre-beamform data acquisition (DAQ) system that can collect data from 128 array elements in parallel. Our DAQ system is intended to interface with a Sonix-RP research scanner through a probe <b>connector</b> <b>port.</b> It comprises three major blocks: 1) a connector board that interfaces with the array probe and the scanner; 2) a main board that triggers data acquisition and controls data transfer to a computer; 3) four receiver boards that are each responsible for acquiring 32 channels of digitized raw data and storing them to the on-board DDR 2 memory. The probe-connecting end of this system is interfaced with TX 810 chips to facilitate switching between transmit and receive modes. When receiving data, the incoming analog signal is first passed into a low-noise amplifier. These signals are then sent into AD 9272 chips on the four receiver boards to perform time gain compensation, anti-alias filtering, and 12 -bit data sampling at an 80 MHz rate. Subsequently, the digitized signal samples are de-serialized using a Virtex- 5 FPGA and are stored into DDR 2 memory. To facilitate data retrieval, we implemented a Virtex- 5 FPGA on the main board to initiate data transfer, and if preferred, to perform onboard beamforming (programmable by user) prior to sending data to a computer through a USB 2. 0 link. For our prototype, we used 16 GB of DDR 2 memory for data storage. With a frame rate of 35 Hz, a 10 cm depth-of-view and 128 transmit firings per frame, this DAQ system is capable of collecting pre-beamform data from all array channels for 2. 5 seconds. We are currently completing the prototype development in collaboration with Ultrasonix. © 2009 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Architecture-based {{software}} {{development is the}} implementation of a software system in terms of its architectural constructs (e. g., components, <b>connectors,</b> <b>ports).</b> It has been shown as an effective approach to realizing and managing the architecture of large-scale software systems. Several techniques and tools have been developed that are intended to aid with the architecture-based development of software systems. While these approaches provide adequate implementation support for some aspects of software architectures, they often lack sufficient support for implementing and enforcing the system’s software architectural style. In this paper, we argue that the lack of sufficient support for architectural styles is a by-product of its crosscutting structure. In turn, this makes it impossible to realize styles using the object-oriented programming methodology. We present a new approach to implementing architectural styles that is based on the aspect-oriented programming paradigm. 1...|$|R
