40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that etiologic heterogeneity may complicate epidemiologic analyses designed to identify risk factors for birth defects. <b>Case</b> <b>classification</b> uses knowledge of embryologic and pathogenetic mechanisms to make case groups more homogeneous and is important to the success of birth defects studies. METHODS: The goal of the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS), an ongoing multi-site case-control study, is to identify environmental and genetic risk factors for birth defects. Information on environmental risk factors is collected through an hour-long maternal interview, and DNA is collected from the infant and both parents for evaluation of genetic risk factors. Clinical data on infants are reviewed by clinical geneticists to ensure they meet the detailed case definitions developed specifically for the study. To standardize the methods of <b>case</b> <b>classification</b> for the study, an algorithm has been developed to guide NBDPS clinical geneticists in this process. RESULTS: Methods for <b>case</b> <b>classification</b> into isolated, multiple, and syndrome categories are described. Defects considered minor for the purposes of <b>case</b> <b>classification</b> are defined. Differences in the approach to <b>case</b> <b>classification</b> for studies of specific defects and of specific exposures are noted. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>case</b> <b>classification</b> schema developed for the NBDPS may be of value to other clinicians working on epidemiologic studies of birth defects etiology. Consideration of these guidelines will lead to more comparable case groups, an important element of careful studies aimed at identifying risk factors for birth defects.

40|$|Summary The World Health Organization (WHO) dengue {{classification}} scheme for dengue fever (DF) and {{dengue haemorrhagic fever}} (DHF) /dengue shock syndrome (DSS) has been adopted as the standard for diagnosis, clinical management and reporting. In recent years, difficulties in applying the WHO <b>case</b> <b>classification</b> {{have been reported in}} several countries. A multicenter study was carried out in Asia and Latin America to analyze the variation and utility of dengue clinical guidelines (DCGs) taking as reference the WHO/PAHO guidelines (1994) and the WHO/SEARO guidelines (1998). A document analysis of 13 dengue guidelines was followed by a questionnaire and Focus Group discussions (FGDs) with 858 health care providers in seven countries. Differences in DCGs of the 13 countries were identified including the concept of warning signs, <b>case</b> <b>classification,</b> use of treatment algorithms and grading into levels of severity. The questionnaires and FGDs revealed (1) inaccessibility of DCGs, (2) lack of training, (3) insufficient number of staff to correctly apply the DCGs at the frontline and (4) the unavailability of diagnostic tests. The differences of the DCGs and the inconsistency in their application suggest a need to re-evaluate and standardise DCGs. This applies especially to <b>case</b> <b>classification</b> and case management...|$|E
40|$|This group project {{represented}} {{an attempt to}} study some factors pertaining {{to the formation of}} a system of <b>case</b> <b>classification</b> in a county public welfare agency, Multnomah County Public Welfare Commission, Portland, Oregon. The classification tool was a Case Planning Schedule intended to encourage diagnostic thinking {{on the part of the}} caseworker and to enhance planning and service for the client. The focus of the study was limited to two areas: (1) whether or not the use of the Schedule resulted in agreement among caseworkers in classification and in consistency on prognoses, (2) the attitudes of the caseworkers in various departments toward the <b>Case</b> <b>Classification</b> Program and the Case Planning Schedule. Background for the study involved a search of the literature surrounding new approaches to the problems of 2 ̆ 2 multi-problem families 2 ̆ 2 and public assistance caseloads. Consideration was given to agency structure and the circumstances surrounding the creation of the Oregon Program for <b>Case</b> <b>Classification.</b> Five main hypotheses were tested. With one a comparison was made between classification and prognostication of cases with and without a <b>case</b> <b>classification</b> Schedule. The other testable hypotheses were dealt with by administration of an interviewing schedule designed to gather data regarding staff attitudes toward the Program and the Schedule. Appropriate statistical tests of significance were employed and a content analysis was used in connection with an open-ended attitudinal question. Qualitative and quantitative findings were consistent in demonstrating that caseworkers tended to be favorable toward the intent of the Program but critical toward implementation procedures. Divergent viewpoints were shown in comparing responses of workers by categories of work-load assignments departmental assignments, and length of service in the agency. These findings suggest that additional research include an evaluation of the validity of such systems...|$|E

RESULTS: An endoleak was detected in 23 patients. Seventeen of the 23 dynamic series were technically successful (no disturbing artifacts limiting the diagnostic value).

40|$|Organization (WHO) dengue <b>case</b> <b>classification</b> {{criteria}} for its diagnosis and management. Differentiation between classic dengue fever (DF) and {{dengue haemorrhagic fever}} (DHF) or severe dengue is a key aspect of dengue <b>case</b> <b>classification.</b> The geographic expansion of dengue and its increased incidence in older age groups {{have contributed to the}} limited applicability of the 1997 case definitions. Clinical experience of dengue suggests that the illness presents as a spectrum of disease instead of distinct phases. However, despite the rigid grouping of dengue into DF, DHF and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), overlap between the different manifestations has often been observed, which has affected clinical management and triage of patients. The findings of the DENCO study evaluating the 1997 case definitions formed the basis of the revised 2009 WHO case definitions, which classified the illness into dengue with and without warning signs and severe dengue. Although the revised scheme is more sensitive to the diagnosis of severe dengue, and beneficial to triage and case management, there remain issues with its applicability. It is {{considered by many to be}} too broad, requiring more specific definition of warning signs. Quantitative research into the predictive value of these warning signs on patient outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of the new classification system is required to ascertain whether the new classification system requires further modification, or whether elements of both classification systems can be combined...|$|E
40|$|This small {{exploratory}} {{study was designed}} to test the hypothesis that thin melanoma lesions contain nuclei of two similar phenotypes, in different proportions. In lesions likely to progress to metastatic disease, one of these phenotypes predominates. Histopathological sections from 18 cases of thin melanomas which did not progress to metastasis, and from 10 cases which did progress were imaged and digitized at high resolution, with a total of 2084 and 1148 nuclei, respectively, recorded. Five karyometric features were used to discriminate between nuclei from indolent and from potentially metastatic lesions. For each case, the percentage of nuclei classified by the discriminant function as having come from a potentially metastatic lesion was determined and termed as <b>case</b> <b>classification</b> criterion. Standard histopathological criteria, such as ulceration and high mitotic index, indicated in this material the need for intensive therapy for only one of the 10 participants, as compared with 7 / 10 identified correctly by the karyometric measure. Using a <b>case</b> <b>classification</b> criterion threshold of 40 %, the overall accuracy was 86 % in the test set.

The <b>case</b> <b>classification</b> part consists of 16 cases of U. S. covert actions during the Cold War period. I classify my cases based on whether they have been exposed or not, as well as I look whether their exposure had an effect on the U. S. President’s popularity.

Throughout the case studies, I have examined the effect of exposure on popularity in the following dimensions: media coverage, congressional investigations, presidential approval ratings, and election results. Based on the results of case studies, it is concluded that the disclosure of covert actions had a less significant effect that lasted on a temporary basis and did not have a major impact in a longer perspective.
