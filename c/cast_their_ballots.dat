5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the advance}} voting period, the total number of votes was 1,249,198, or 31.2% of the electorate, with more women voting. In the {{previous}} election, 29.2% voted in advance. Significantly, President Tarja Halonen voted during advance voting. However, there were some problems with expatriate voting as the embassy in Germany ran out of ballots on 9 April forcing an extension to 11 April. The expatriate vote was considerably higher than in the previous election, up from 8.6% in 2007 to 15%. The Foreign Ministry said that {{out of a total of}} 228,000 expatriates eligible to vote 35,049 <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots</b> at the Finnish diplomatic missions, which was up from 27,399.|$|E
5|$|Although Hancock won Georgia's {{popular vote}} easily, {{there was an}} {{irregularity}} in that state’s electoral votes. According to Article II, Section 1, clause 3 of the Constitution, “The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.” In 1792, Congress had set the date for the Electoral College {{to vote on the}} first Wednesday in December, which in 1880 fell on December 1. However, Georgia’s electors failed to <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots</b> on December 1, instead voting on the following Wednesday, December 8. Congress chose to count Georgia's vote in the official tally anyway; had they not done so, Hancock’s electoral vote would have been 144, not 155.|$|E
5|$|The EBRC's {{terms of}} {{reference}} are issued by the Prime Minister, and are not embodied in legislation. In giving recommendations for boundary changes over the years, the Committee has considered various factors, including using hill ridges, rivers and roads as boundaries rather than arbitrarily drawn lines; {{and the need for}} electoral divisions to have approximately equal numbers of voters so that electors' votes carry the same weight regardless of where they <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots.</b> In 1963, the EBRC adopted a rule allowing the numbers of voters in divisions to differ by no more than 20%. The permitted deviation was increased to 30% in 1980. It is up to the Cabinet {{to decide whether or not}} to accept the Committee's recommendations.|$|E

5|$|Nixon's advisors denied he had {{abandoned}} {{a desire to}} bring the American people together. However, they were divided between those who sought national unity, and those, such as campaign manager and Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who felt Nixon should concentrate on keeping the voters who had <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots</b> for him, and should seek {{to win over the}} voters who had favored third-party candidate Alabama Governor George Wallace, as the key to reelection in 1972. According to Safire, after taking office, Nixon and his advisors decided he need not bring the country together, but need only work to secure his reelection by appealing to voters who were not hostile to Nixon and his policies—they became known as the Silent Majority. Historian Stanley Kutler suggested in his book on the Nixon administration that Nixon's policies widened divisions in America, but that the nation finally came together late in his presidency—to reject Nixon and demand his removal.|$|E
5|$|After {{speeches in}} favor of the other front-runners, Garfield rose to place Sherman's name in nomination; his nominating speech was well-received, but the delegates mustered little {{excitement}} for the idea of Sherman as the next president. The first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; Sherman's 93 placed him in a distant third. Subsequent ballots quickly demonstrated a deadlock between the Grant and Blaine forces, with neither having the 379 votes needed for nomination. Jeremiah McLain Rusk, a member of the Wisconsin delegation, and Benjamin Harrison, an Indiana delegate, sought to break the deadlock by shifting a few of the anti-Grant votes to a dark horse candidate—Garfield. Garfield gained 50 votes on the 35th ballot, and the stampede began. Garfield protested to the other members of his Ohio delegation that he had not sought the nomination and had never intended to betray Sherman, but they overruled his objections and <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots</b> for him. In the next round of voting, nearly all of the Sherman and Blaine delegates shifted their support to Garfield, giving him 399 votes and the Republican nomination. Most of the Grant forces backed the former president to the end, creating a disgruntled Stalwart minority in the party. To obtain that faction's support for the ticket, former New York customs collector Chester A. Arthur, a member of Conkling's political machine, was chosen as the vice-presidential nominee.|$|E
25|$|Appellants {{invoke the}} right to vote and to have their votes counted. But they are {{permitted}} to vote and their votes are counted. They go to the polls, they <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots,</b> they send their representatives to the state councils. Their complaint is simply that the representatives are not sufficiently numerous or powerful.|$|E

40|$|The {{television}} networks 2 ̆ 7 practice of predicting {{the outcomes of}} political contests of national significance early on Election Day has generated considerable controversy. In 1980, NBC 2 ̆ 7 s early projection of a Ronald Reagan landslide, together with Jimmy Carter 2 ̆ 7 s early concession speech, was widely reported to have discouraged many voters in Western states from <b>casting</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots.</b> Similar behavior by the networks during the 1982 and 1984 elections, while yielding fewer dramatic anecdotes about voters leaving the polls without <b>casting</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots,</b> likewise generated concern among politicians and the public at large...|$|R
50|$|Voter turnout {{nationwide}} was 60.9%, {{the lowest}} in Canadian history at that time, with 13,683,570 out of 22,466,621 registered voters <b>casting</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots.</b> The voter turnout fell by more than 3pp from the 2000 federal election which had 64.1% turnout.|$|R
25|$|Despite Mott's {{opposition}} to electoral politics, her fame had {{reached into the}} political arena even before the July, 1848 women's rights convention. During the June, 1848 National Convention of the Liberty Party, 5 of the 84 voting delegates <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots</b> for Lucretia Mott to be their party's candidate for the Office of U.S. Vice President. In delegate voting, she placed 4th {{in a field of}} nine.|$|E
25|$|The {{community}} of Dixville Notch traditionally opens its polling {{place in the}} ballroom of The Balsams Grand Resort Hotel at midnight, usually {{in front of a}} crowd of journalists, where the village's handful of voters <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots</b> before the polls close about less than ten minutes later. This has led many presidential candidates to visit the area before the New Hampshire primary in hopes of securing an early-morning boost.|$|E
25|$|Horowitz {{has argued}} that a single {{transferable}} vote system could prevent the ethnification of political parties because voters <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots</b> in order of preference. This means that a voter could cast some of his votes to parties other than his co-ethnic party. This in turn would compel political parties to broaden their manifestos to appeal to voters across the ethnic divide to hoover up second and third preference votes.|$|E
5000|$|The Electoral Commission later {{reported}} that approximately 305,000 voters {{were turned away}} from polls, with an additional 207,000 voters being [...] "assisted" [...] in <b>casting</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots.</b> There were also more than 100,000 centenarian ghost voters on the electoral roll.|$|R
50|$|The {{first round}} of the {{by-election}} was held on 26 May, and the second round was held on 9 June. Citizens wishing to <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballot</b> over the Internet for the first round were able to do so from 15 to 21 May.|$|R
5000|$|Identification of a pure [...] "issue only ads" [...] made by {{interest}} {{advocacy groups}} is difficult.

25|$|State law {{permits a}} town with fewer than 100 {{residents}} to open its polls at midnight, and close when all registered citizens have <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots.</b> As such, the communities of Dixville Notch in Coos County and Hart's Location in Carroll County, among others, have chosen to implement these provisions. Dixville Notch and Hart's Location are traditionally the first places in both New Hampshire and the U.S. to vote in presidential primaries and elections.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1990s, the {{organization}} restored its finances, permitting the NAACP National Voter Fund to launch a major get-out-the-vote offensive in the 2000 U.S. presidential elections. 10.5 million African Americans <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots</b> in the election. This was one million more than four years before. The NAACP's effort was credited by observers as playing a significant role in Democrat Al Gore's winning several states where the election was close, such as Pennsylvania and Michigan.|$|E
25|$|Previously, {{there was}} a general {{automatic}} and indiscriminate restrictions on prisoners' right to vote. A case was brought by two men, Chan Kin-sum and Choi Chuen-sun, who were in jail during the challenge, and Leung Kwok-hung, to challenge the restrictions. Mr. Justice Andrew Cheung (as the Chief Judge then was) ruled that inmates have the constitutional right to register as voters and <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots</b> while serving sentences, which was unjustificably infringed by the indiscriminate ban.|$|E
50|$|Voters {{wishing to}} verify that their vote is unmodified may write down the {{confirmation}} codes for each race on a detachable chit that contains the ballot's serial number. Otherwise, the voter can simply ignore the code and continue to mark and <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballot</b> as normal.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{unforeseen}} circumstances, voting at the 18th {{polling station}} of the Athens A' Electoral District was aborted. In accordance with Article 102 {{of the electoral}} law, a new election {{will be held on}} 24 June and the 539 registered voters will be asked to <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballot</b> again.|$|R
25|$|The City {{is divided}} into three precincts with each precinct having two council representatives. Voters <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballot</b> for one {{candidate}} from each precinct. One representative is elected at large and serves as City Mayor. Persons elected to City Council take office {{on the first day of}} January following the election.|$|R
25|$|Another {{method used}} early in U.S. history was {{to divide the}} state into electoral {{district}}s. By this method, voters in each district would <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots</b> for the electors they supported and the winner in each district would become the elector. This was similar to how states are currently separated by congressional districts. However, the difference {{stems from the fact}} every state always had two more electoral districts than congressional districts. As with congressional districts, moreover, this method is vulnerable to gerrymandering.|$|E
25|$|Polling {{stations}} {{were scheduled to}} open at 7am and to remain open until noon local time on 9 April. However, several stations experienced delays with the opening time and had to extend polling hours {{in order to accommodate}} voters who had not yet <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots.</b> Each polling station was scheduled to begin counting election results at noon local time and report them to the General Election Commission. Ballot counting continued until 9 May, when the Commission would certify its results.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, of the 11 {{states in which}} {{amendments}} defining marriage were on the ballot, all passed handily. Bush won in nine, including Ohio. Interpretation of some exit polling suggests that the amendments may have brought out one million additional voters, most of which came {{out for the first}} time to <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots</b> for Bush. Notably, a vast majority of these states have not voted for a Democrat in many years. The two states that Bush did not win, Michigan and Oregon, still passed amendments limiting official recognition of marriage to one man one woman unions.|$|E
50|$|All British {{elections}} are held on a Thursday. The Electoral Commission is unsure when this practice arose, but dates it to 1931, {{with the suggestion}} that it was made to coincide with market day; this would ease voting {{for those who had}} to travel to the towns to <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballot.</b>|$|R

50|$|In Romania, a {{national}} referendum is considered valid only if at least 50% plus {{one of the}} registered voters <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballot.</b> For a valid referendum, the outcome is determined by a simple majority of valid votes cast. The whole process thus involves a double majority in form of a quorum.|$|R
25|$|Jewish American {{communities}} {{tend to be}} a stronghold for the Democratic Party, {{with more}} than 70% of Jewish voters having <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots</b> for the Democrats in the 2004 and 2006 elections. Al Gore received 79% of the Jewish votes in 2000, and Barack Obama won about 77% of the Jewish vote in 2008. Support tends to vary among specific sectarian groups. For example, only 13% of Orthodox Jews supported Barack Obama in 2008 while around 60% of Conservative Jews and Reform Jews did so. A 2010 poll by the Pew Research Center found that 60% of self-described Jews identified as Democratic or leaning towards the party, compared to 33% with those feelings towards Republicans.|$|E
25|$|Technically {{the voters}} of Iowa <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots</b> for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. Iowa is {{allocated}} 7 electors because it has 5 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 7 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate {{and his or her}} running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 7 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for President and Vice President. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.|$|E
25|$|Later on {{election}} night, after Obama {{was named the}} winner, he picked up several more wins in swing states in which the polls had shown a close race. These included Florida, Indiana, Virginia, and the western states of Colorado and Nevada. All of these states had been carried by Bush in 2004. North Carolina and the bellwether state of Missouri remained undecided for several days. Eventually Obama was declared the winner in North Carolina and McCain in Missouri, with Obama pulling out a rare win in Nebraska's 2nd congressional district. This put the projected electoral vote count at 365 for Obama and 173 for McCain. Obama's victories in the populous swing states of Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Virginia contributed to his decisive win. The presidential electors <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballots</b> for President and Vice President, and Congress tallied these votes on January 8, 2009.|$|E
50|$|Local {{elections}} {{were held in}} the West Bank on 12 April 1976, {{on the order of}} Israeli military authorities and under the 1955 Jordanian municipal elections law. Only about 63,000 voters <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballot.</b> The result was a victory for supporters of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Voter turnout was 72.3%.|$|R
50|$|The {{first three}} days of the Convention, November 29 to December 1, {{constituted}} the biennial convention of the Liberal Party of Canada.

50|$|The {{two main}} systems of local {{government}} include Mayor-council government in which voters <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> <b>ballot</b> for the mayor who represents the executive branch, and another ballot for the city council.
