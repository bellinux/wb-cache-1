40|$|To {{decrease}} the temperature coefficients of sintered Nd-Fe-B magnets, the influencing factors on temperature coefficients, especially the reversible temperature coefficient β of intrinsic <b>coercivity</b> <b>Hcj,</b> were analyzed. The {{results showed that}} the absolute value of β decreased with increasing Hcj and also the ratio of microstructure parameter c to Neff, indicating that the increase of magnetocrystalline anisotropy field HA and c/Neff can effectively {{decrease the}} absolute value of β. On the basis of this analysis, a sintered Nd-Fe-B magnet with a low temperature coefficient of Hcj was fabricated through composition design, and the value of β was only - 0. 385 %/ºC in the temperature interval of 20 - 150 ºC...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} DyHx {{addition}} on magnetic properties and microstructure of Nd-Fe-B sintered magnets were investigated. In {{order to obtain}} the best magnetic properties, the effects of sintering temperature and annealing time on magnetic properties were also investigated. The results shown that the addition of DyHx can affect the microstructure, increase the intrinsic <b>coercivity</b> (<b>Hcj),</b> and improve the thermal stability of sintered Nd-Fe-B magnets. The remanence (Br) and Hcj showed different variation trends as sintering temperature changes. Within a reasonable range, sintering at higher temperature can get higher Br but lower Hcj. The Hcj was further increased by heat treatment and annealing time was extended. VC 2012 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
40|$|The {{two main}} {{permanent}} magnet technologies (hybrid and pure permanent magnets) are compared for in-vacuum undulator design. The small ratio gap/period favours the hybrid technology despite {{of the difficult}} passive field termination design. The choice of the permanent magnet material is an issue. Based on non linear permanent magnet models, simulations using RADIA are presented. The material intrinsic <b>coercivity</b> <b>Hcj</b> is determined for both NdFeB and Sm 2 Co 17 material to avoid any irreversible demagnetisation during the required baking (≤ 140 deg.

The starting iron oxide powder (Fe 2 O 3) and barium carbonate (BaCO 3) were prepared by powder metallurgy technique by {{the stages of}} mixing, calcining, milling, compacting, and sintering. Weight ratio of Fe 2 O 3 : BaCO 3 was 88. 74 wt% : 17. 52 wt%. Some additives such as calcium oxide (CaO), silicon dioxide (SiO 2), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were added after calcining process.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a Nd-Fe-B sintered magnet of extremely high performance. The intrinsic <b>coercivity</b> <b>Hcj</b> {{is as high as}} 35. 2 kOe (2803 kA/m) together with the maximum energy product (BH) max of 40. 4 MGOe (321. 6 kJ/m 3). These values result in Hcj (kOe) + (BH) max (MGOe) > 75. Between 293 K (20 ºC) and 473 K (200 ºC), the temperature coefficients of remanence and intrinsic coercivity are αBr = − 0. 122 %/°C and αHcj = − 0. 403 %/°C, respectively. A maximum operating temperature of 503 K (230 ºC) is obtained when permeance coefficient Pc = −B/H = 2. Grain boundary diffusion (GBD) technique on magnet surface has been developed to increase Hcj by 3. 6 kOe without significantly decrease of Br and (BH) max. The intrinsic coercivity of the GBD treated magnet Hcj(C) has a linear relationship with that of the untreated magnet Hcj(B) between 200 K and 473 K (in unit of kOe) : Hcj(C) = 1. 03 Hcj(B) + 2. 38. The enhancement of Hcj by GBD treatment has contributions not only from the improvement of microstructure but also from the increase of Ha in the grain surface layer. It is also found that GBD treatment brings no deterioration in corrosion resistance of untreated magnet...|$|E
