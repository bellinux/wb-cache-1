40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new uplink visible light indoor positioning system that estimates {{the position of the}} users in the network-side of a visible light communications (VLC) system. This technique takes advantage of the diffuse components of the uplink channel impulse response for positioning, which has been considered as a destructive noise in existing visible light communication positioning literature. Exploiting the line of sight (LOS) component, the most significant diffusive component of the channel (the second power peak (SPP)), and the delay time between LOS and SPP, we present a proof of concept analysis for positioning using fixed reference points, i. e. uplink photodetectors (PDs). Simulation results show the root mean square (RMS) positioning accuracy of 25 cm and 5 cm for one and 4 PDs scenarios, respectively.

In the framework of Spain’s Transparency Act of 2013, an analysis is conducted of the information on research projects headed or participated in by Spanish public university teaching staff and funded by public institutions and bodies. The aims are to ascertain whether this information is associated with and published on transparency portals and to determine its typology and characteristics. The analysis covers portals and websites, access points {{and the type of}} information furnished. Although universities comply with the transparency obligations laid down in the act, the information on research projects freely available is not individualised and only rarely matched to results (such as articles, patents or <b>conference</b> <b>communications),</b> particulars that would not only encourage knowledge sharing, but enhance the credibility of and trust in research funding. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{volume is}} the {{proceedings}} of the conference entitled "Manpower Planning and Organization Design" which was held in Stresa, Italy, 20 - 24 June 1977. The Conference was sponsored by the NATO Scientific Affairs Division and organized jointly through the Special Programs Panels on Human Factors and on Systems Science. Two Conference Directors were appointed with overall responsibilities for the programme and for policy, and they were assisted in their tasks by a small advisory panel consisting of Professor A. Charnes (University of Texas), Professor W. W. Cooper (Carnegie Mellon University, now at Harvard University) and Dr. F. A. Heller (TavistQck Institute of Human Relations). Professor R. Florio of Bergamo kindly agreed to become Administrative Director and, as such, was responsible for all the local arrangements. The Conference Directors were further assisted by "national points of contact" appointed from each of the member countries of NATO. These national representatives played a substantial part in the search for participants and in the collection and trans­ mission of the various <b>conference</b> <b>communications.</b> Although full details of the national points of contact are included in the Appendices, special tribute must be paid to the UK point of contact, Brian Smith of the Civil Service Department.

40|$|Ambient {{backscatter}} communication (AmBC) {{enables a}} passive backscatter device to transmit {{information to a}} reader using ambient RF signals, and {{has emerged as a}} promising solution to green Internet-of-Things (IoT). Conventional AmBC receivers are interested in recovering the information from the ambient backscatter device (A-BD) only. In this paper, we propose a cooperative AmBC (CABC) system in which the reader recovers information not only from the A-BD, but also from the RF source. We first establish the system model for the CABC system from spread spectrum and spectrum sharing perspectives. Then, for flat fading channels, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) detector, suboptimal linear detectors as well as successive interference-cancellation (SIC) based detectors. For frequency-selective fading channels, the system model for the CABC system over ambient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) carriers is proposed, upon which a low-complexity optimal ML detector is derived. For both kinds of channels, the bit-error-rate (BER) expressions for the proposed detectors are derived in closed forms. Finally, extensive numerical results have shown that, when the A-BD signal and the RF-source signal have equal symbol period, the proposed SIC-based detectors can achieve near-ML detection performance for typical application scenarios, and when the A-BD symbol period is longer than the RF-source symbol period, the existence of backscattered signal in the CABC system can enhance the ML detection performance of the RF-source signal, thanks to the beneficial effect of the backscatter link when the A-BD transmits at a lower rate than the RF source.

40|$|In western Africa, {{multiple}} {{species of}} marine fish are exploited {{by a large}} fishing community. The exploitation of this resource calls {{for the establishment of}} appropriate management and conservation strategies at national and regional levels, which must start with the correct species identification of catches at fish landing sites. To improve fisheries management in West Africa, research actions have recently been developed, but surveys for the correct identification of species and delimitation of stocks are still in need as e. g the famous sardinella shared stock between Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea Bissau. Research {{of the past two decades}} established that molecular approaches are the best to fill the need especially in poor data area. To address these challenges, we propose a research programme for improving the identification of catches following two objectives. The first objective is to implement a biodiversity collaborative survey on landing sites, with small scale fishermen, using a barcoding approach which will provide a reference barcode library for future studies. This objective may also help discovering new species, establish data base, follow inventory of genetic resources and identify taxonomic ambiguities as well as traceability of fishing product for e. g. exportation. The second is the development of appropriate molecular tools for the delimitation of potential genetic stocks in West Africa for selected fish of high economic importance. The project involves a network of collaborators which will facilitate different aspects of the study including collection/sampling and laboratory procedures. The outcomes of the project include the development of a molecular resource for West African fish, improvement of fisheries management particularly for transboundary species and a better understanding of their biodiversity along the East Atlantic. The project will also contribute to building human capacity in fish identification as well as strengthening a collaboration network between Mauritania to Guinea and South Africa. Scientific outputs will include identification tools, reports for national and regional fisheries organizations, <b>conference</b> <b>communications,</b> and scientific articles in international peer-reviewed journals. The new knowledge gathered by the project will be crucial for better management of commercial and threatened fish in West Africa as well as establish a precedent for future studies on other commercially important taxa...|$|E
40|$|We {{are proud}} to {{announce}} that this meeting is supported by His Excellency the President of the Portuguese Republic. This book of abstracts represents the formal publication of the 31 st European Culture Collections’ Organization (ECCO) meeting, devoted to Biological Resource Centres - Closing the Gap Between Science and Society, held on the 14 th and 15 th of June, 2012, at the University of Minho, Campus de Gualtar, Braga, Portugal. A special issue of selected full papers will follow in the new publication: International Journal of Microbiology and Microbial Biotechnology. The book adheres to the precedent set in 2003 when {{the proceedings of the}} 22 nd ECCO meeting, also held in Braga, were published. The 2003 conference considered the Use of Microbes, whereas the current meeting deals with the wider implications of Biological Resource Centres (BRC) to society at large. This reflects well the development of ECCO as we are now in the position to consider the wider implications of greater collaboration between BRC, which is mirrored in the groundbreaking projects: European Consortium of Microbial Resources Centres (EMbaRC), and Microbial Resources Research Infrastructure (MIRRI). These involve not only European culture collections, but also those from further afield, where such examples of international collaboration are essential in the current economic climate. It is how BRC will contribute to the economies of countries that is the theme of the 2012 conference, which is a crucial factor in deciding the relevance of these organisations. Crucially, we need to know how new generations of stakeholders perceive collections, as discussed in the opening address of the conference. Ever more, collaboration between culture collections, SMEs and large companies are required to ensure that the industry´s needs are met. We need to determine how BRC can be made more profitable which is the “bottom line”. However, how do we reconcile profit with scientific excellence as evidenced by high rates of high-impact scientific publications? One solution may be to hire culture collection representatives to cold-call and visit companies and sell proactively our products. To what extent can culture collections become companies in their own right hence exploiting their own biological resources? How are products from BRC to be considered as successful? Presumably by the monetary reward they bring to the parent organisation. Is it possible to obtain large scale funding from pharmaceutical companies for bioprospecting projects, or will it always be small token amounts plus royalties in the (low) probability of a successful product? Can we position ourselves to help developing countries utilise their often immense biodiversity? Other societal issues include biosecurity and biosafety – increasingly a concern in today´s world. How secure do BRCs need to be to continue the necessary tradition of open scientific research whilst ensuring that society is safe? What is the position of taxonomic research in our cultures when many taxonomists are not being replaced after they retire? How do we value taxonomy? Climate change is perhaps the most important issue facing our well being; how can collections contribute to the understanding of climatic alterations. We have microbes preserved for many decades and will accumulate more strains in the future, which surely can be used to assess change: Climate change needs greater emphasis in future work for BRC projects. In the end, all these will help to make culture collections more relevant. The current meeting commences with a lecture addressing the importance of microbiology to society in general, and in particular how children perceive microbes in their daily lives. The conference itself is organised into 4 symposia: (A) New Horizons in Microbial Taxonomy, (B) Biological Resource Centres: Is the future in our hands?, (C) Biological Resource Centres from the Stakeholders' Vision and (D) Microbial Applications, Lessons Learned from EMbaRC. Two round-table discussions concerning the (A) Biosecurity Code of Conduct for BRCs and (B) Innovation and Bioeconomy: Patent Deposits under the Budapest Treaty. We are delighted at the participation of 17 European and non-European countries (i. e. Algeria, Brazil, China, Japan and the Russian Federation) and the more than 100 excellent abstracts resulting in 17 oral <b>conference</b> <b>communications,</b> 2 round table oral communications and short statements and 83 posters. These figures confirm the ECCO XXXI meeting to be a very significant international conference. To all contributing authors, we would like to convey our sincere thanks for their endeavours in making this meeting an important contribution to consolidating knowledge related to BRC and associated activities. We are confident that you will find the papers and discussions comprehensive and instructive whilst confirming that BRC and their stakeholders can join together usefully to develop Biotechnology and, ultimately, the Bioeconomy. Thanks are due to the many individuals who have been involved {{at all levels of the}} planning, coordinating, reviewing, organizing and convening of the symposia. The accommodation and meeting facilities and, last but not the least, the organisation of the social events are all greatly appreciated. Finally, we wish you a very productive meeting and a pleasant stay in Braga. The Editor...|$|E
