40|$|<b>Chlortalidone</b> (HIGROTON) is a {{diuretic}} drug {{widely used}} in antihypertensive therapy. Thus far, only two solid-state polymorphs of <b>chlortalidone</b> have been reported. We elucidated the structure of <b>chlortalidone</b> form I and a new polymorph. This new phase, namely, <b>chlortalidone</b> form III, was also entirely characterized. It was possible to conclude {{that it is a}} conformer with a different orientation of the chlorobenzenesulfonamide moiety. Compared to form I, it has a rotation of about 90 degrees on the axis of the C-C bond bridging the substituted phenyl and isoindolinyl rings. This conformational feature is related to the crystal packing patterns of the <b>chlortalidone</b> forms. Furthermore, certain intermolecular hydrogen bonds are present in both polymorphs, giving rise to ribbons with <b>chlortalidone</b> enantiomers alternately placed into them. The <b>chlortalidone</b> form I and form III crystallize in the triclinic space group P (1) over bar as racemic mixtures. Additional conformational details also differentiate the <b>chlortalidone</b> conformers. Slight twists on the isoindolinyl and sulfamyl groups exist.

40|$|Minoxidil is {{a potent}} {{antihypertensive}} drug widely used in severe arterial hypertension and in that refractory to treatment. Its effectiveness in less severe forms of hypertension was evaluated in 15 patients who had either a severe to moderate arterial hypertension not previously treated, or who did not tolerate {{the side effects of}} other antihypertensive drugs. The usefulness of methyldopa and <b>chlortalidone</b> to prevent a potential minoxidil-induced tachycardia and fluid retention, respectively, was also tested. The patients were initially treated with <b>chlortalidone</b> 100 mg/day, and methyldopa 500 mg/day. Minoxidil was then given in increasing doses until the diastolic blood pressure was equal to or inferior to 90 mmHg. This occurred consistently at doses which ranged from 5 to 50 mg/day (average, 29 mg). Treatment with minoxidil was continued for four months; tolerance to the drugs was not observed. Low doses of methyl-dopa and <b>chlortalidone</b> were effective in controlling the tachycardia and the retention of sodium and water induced by minoxidil. The three associated drugs were well tolerated and the life quality improved in most patients. Hypertrichosis was the most consistent side effect.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: The use of thiazide diuretics in the {{treatment}} of hypertension is widely considered as a first-line treatment, given the efficacy and low cost of this class of drugs. This indication is not unanimous, because thiazides can cause metabolic alterations, and other side effects that reduce compliance and persistence on treatment. OBJECTIVES: In a multicentre, open-label randomized study we compared adherence and persistence to therapy of <b>chlortalidone</b> versus other treatments, as a first-line antihypertensive therapy. METHODS: Ninety-two general practitioners (GPs) recruited 2409 hypertensive patients with indication to antihypertensive therapy, who were randomized in two arms to start treatment with <b>chlortalidone</b> (12. 5 - 25  mg daily) or any other single medications (excluding thiazides). The patients have been followed for at least 2 years. RESULT: Patients receiving diuretic therapy as first-line antihypertensive treatment, modified antihypertensive treatment regimen more often than the others (79. 1 versus 43. 9 %; χ (2) <  0. 0001). Patients starting with diuretics received greater number of drugs, compared to patients starting with different antihypertensive therapy (1. 55 versus 1. 4 antihypertensive drugs; P <  0. 0001), but achieved the same blood pressure (BP) control during the follow-up. No differences were observed in persistence and adherence to treatment between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the recommendation to start antihypertensive therapy with diuretics, when no compelling indications are present, is not supported by the evidence that this strategy produces more rapid and better control of BP...|$|E

40|$|<b>Chlortalidone</b> (CTD) is an {{antihypertensive}} drug for which only two solid state phases have been structurally elucidated thus far. Here, we have prepared a chloroform solvate thereof, namely, CTD Form IV, and its structure {{was compared to}} those of Form I and Form III. Its two conformers exhibit a dual structural feature {{in relation to the}} antecedent polymorphs. Both CTD molecules of Form IV adopt a Form III-like conformation, which is featured, if the conformation of CTD Form I is used as a reference, by a rotation of about 90 degrees on the axis of the C-C bond bridging the substituted benzene and isoindolinyl rings. However, CTD Form IV assembles as in the Form I crystal packing despite the different stacking fashion of their centrosymmetric dimers. In contrast to Form I, there is no offset stacking in Form IV, which forces a bend of ca. 24 degrees between the planes passing through the isoindolinyl moieties of two [100]-stacked dimers. Chloroform molecules at a maximum stoichiometry of 0. 25 mol per mol of the drug play a stabilizing role in the assembly of Form IV by filling the channels formed on the crystals.

The main pathophysiological substrate of Meniere's disease is certainly endolymphatic hydrops, the etiology of which is probably multifactorial, but still not completely understood. Recently, {{it has been shown}} that vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus can be the result of a vascular loop impinging on the VIIIth nerve and giving rise to the symptomatological complex that can been defined as Meniere's disease due to ‘cochleovestibular nerve compression syndrome’ (CNCS).

40|$|Background and objective: Isolated {{systolic}} hypertension (ISH) affects 10 - 20 % of {{the elderly}} population and is strongly related {{to the risk of}} cardiovascular events. Elevated systolic BP values are primarily caused by reduced large vessel compliance with a consequent increase in total peripheral resistance. Vasodilating drugs, such as calcium channel antagonists, have proven to be effective in controlling ISH in elderly patients. This study set out to compare the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of two different calcium channel antagonists, manidipine and amlodipine, administered once daily in elderly subjects with ISH. Methods: In a European, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group study, after a 2 -week placebo run-in period, 195 patients aged ≥ 60 years with ISH received manidipine 10 - 20 mg once daily or amlodipine 5 - 10 mg once daily. <b>Chlortalidone</b> 25 mg once daily could be added to the high dose of test drug in the event of insufficient antihypertensive control. The primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of patients with a reduction in office sitting systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 15 mm Hg, measured at trough, at the final visit. Secondary efficacy parameters included: the proportion of patients with a normal sitting SBP value (< 140 mm Hg) at the final visit; a change from baseline to the final visit in mean office trough sitting SBP; a change from baseline to the final visit in the cardiovascular risk score as measured by the INDANA (INdividual Data ANalysis of Antihypertensive intervention trials) project score; the proportion of patients with at least a two-point reduction in the cardiovascular risk score; the percentage of patients requiring upward dose titration and diuretic add-on treatment and the investigator's final judgement. Safety and tolerability evaluations were based on adverse events, ECG and laboratory tests, and clinically relevant reports of abnormalities. Results: In the intention-to-treat population (n = 189), 76 % and 72 % of patients in the manidipine and amlodipine groups, respectively, had a reduction in sitting SBP of ≥ 15 mm Hg (p-value not significant for between-group comparison). The percentage of patients with a normal sitting SBP value was 52 % in the manidipine group and 51 % in the amlodipine group (p-value not significant for between-group comparison). Sitting SBP reductions at the end of treatment were - 19. 5 ± 11. 8 mm Hg in patients receiving manidipine and - 18. 4 ± 11. 1 mm Hg in patients receiving amlodipine. Both treatments induced a small reduction in cardiovascular risk score, with 45 % of patients in both treatment groups having a two-point reduction in the final score. At the final visit, approximately half of the patients in both treatment groups were still being treated with the low dose of one of the test drugs (manidipine 10 mg or amlodipine 5 mg). <b>Chlortalidone</b> was added to the high dose of test drugs in 7 % and 11 % of patients in the amlodipine and manidipine groups, respectively. Both drugs were well tolerated, with a higher incidence of oedema in the amlodipine group (9 % vs 4 %). No clinically relevant changes in heart rate were induced by either treatment. Conclusion: In elderly patients with ISH, treatment with manidipine for 12 weeks was well tolerated and effective and the antihypertensive effects obtained with manidipine were the same as those obtained with amlodipine...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} focused {{partly on the}} {{chemical}} development of some chemical functional groups, and partly on our own results connected with research by Vladimir Prelog in the last period of his work. The period Vladimir Prelog spent in Zagreb {{marked the beginning of}} the development of organic synthetic chemistry at the University of Zagreb and at the pharmaceutical company Kaštel, later PLIVA. One approach he took was the synthesis of new potentially active compounds, but more important was the development of a rational and economical procedure for the synthesis of known active compounds. A start was made with the synthesis of azo dyes and quinine analogs. In the last period of his work on chemistry, Prof. Prelog and visiting collaborators, mostly from PLIVA, studied the enantioselectivity of chiral ionophores, such as lyphophyl tartaric acid esters and spirobifluorene crown ethers towards some biologically active amino alcohols by intramolecular binding. The first and most successful result of the collaboration between Kaštel and Vladimir Prelog, was the early entry into the market with sulfanylamide. The key intermediate for the synthesis of sulfanylamide and other subsequently discovered sulfonamides was nitrobenzene. Organic nitro compounds now have a broad application in fine chemical production, as solvents, intermediates and final products. Simple aliphatic and aromatic nitro compounds are used as solvents and reagents; others have been used as intermediates in the synthesis of amino, hydroxy, halogen, sulpho, keto or other functional groups. Some nitro compounds are important active pharmaceuticals, including the Ca-antagonist nifedipine, the anthelmithic metronidazol or the coronary dilatator dinitroisosorbide, while others are explosives like hexogen, octogen or trinitrotoluene. It is known that some nitro compounds are both useful drugs and explosives including the nitro esters nitroglycerine or pentrite. In PLIVA, the nitration process was used in the production of various active pharmaceuticals, such as pyridoxine hydrochloride, metronidazole, methoprolol tartarate, <b>chlortalidone,</b> dinitroisosorbide and lampren. Further synthetic processes were developed in which purchased nitro compounds were used as intermediates for the production of active compounds with nitro or other functional groups. In 1991 when the war broke out in Croatia, some PLIVA chemists were involved in the development and production of explosives from nitro compounds. Thanks to the broad experience and tradition in organic synthesis, within a short time, a laboratory procedure was developed, a semi-production plant on a separate location was adapted and production of the most powerful brisant explosive, octogen had started. Later, an industrial process for the production of pentrite was developed and its trial production started. During this period, laboratory procedures for some other explosives were developed...|$|E
40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus {{is becoming a}} major health problem associated with excess morbidity and mortality. As the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is rapidly increasing, prevention of the disease {{should be considered as}} a key objective in the near future. Besides lifestyle changes, various pharmacological treatments have proven their efficacy in placebo-controlled clinical trials, including antidiabetic drugs such as metformin, acarbose and troglitazone, or antiobesity agents such as orlistat. Arterial hypertension, a clinical entity in which insulin resistance is common, is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes and may precede the disease by several years. While antihypertensive agents such as diuretics or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may worsen insulin resistance and impair glucose tolerance, newer antihypertensive agents exert neutral or even slightly positive metabolic effects. Numerous clinical trials have investigated the effects of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARAs) on insulin sensitivity in hypertensive patients, with or without diabetes, with no consistent results. Almost half of the studies with ACE inhibitors in hypertensive nondiabetic individuals demonstrated a slight but significant increase in insulin sensitivity as assessed by insulin-stimulated glucose disposal during a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp, while the other half failed to reveal any significant change. The effects of ARAs on insulin sensitivity are neutral in most studies. Mechanisms of improvement of glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity through the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are complex. They may include improvement of blood flow and microcirculation in skeletal muscles and, thereby, enhancement of insulin and glucose delivery to the insulin-sensitive tissues, facilitating insulin signalling at the cellular level and improvement of insulin secretion by the beta cells. Six recent large-scale clinical studies reported a remarkably consistent reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in hypertensive patients treated with either ACE inhibitors or ARAs for 3 - 6 years, compared with a thiazide diuretic, beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, the calcium channel antagonist amlodipine or even placebo. The relative risk reduction averaged 14 % (p = 0. 034) in the CAPPP (Captopril Prevention Project) with captopril compared with a thiazide or beta 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist, 34 % (p < 0. 001) in the HOPE (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation) study with ramipril compared with placebo, 30 % (p < 0. 001) in the ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) with lisinopril compared with <b>chlortalidone,</b> 25 % (p < 0. 001) in the LIFE (Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study) with losartan compared with atenolol, and 25 % (p = 0. 09) in the SCOPE (Study on Cognition and Prognosis in the Elderly) with candesartan cilexetil compared with placebo, and 23 % (p < 0. 0001) in the VALUE (Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation) trial with valsartan compared with amlodipine. All these studies considered the development of diabetes as a secondary endpoint, except the HOPE trial where it was a post hoc analysis. These encouraging observations led to the initiation of two large, prospective, placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials whose primary outcome is the prevention of type 2 diabetes: the DREAM (Diabetes REduction Approaches with ramipril and rosiglitazone Medications) trial with the ACE inhibitor ramipril and the NAVIGATOR (Nateglinide And Valsartan in Impaired Glucose Tolerance Outcomes Research) trial with the ARA valsartan. Finally, ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) will also investigate as a secondary endpoint whether it is possible to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes by blocking the RAS with either an ACE inhibitor or an ARA or a combination of both. Thus, the recent consistent observations of a 14 - 34 % reduction of the development of diabetes in hypertensive patients receiving ACE inhibitors or ARAs are exciting. From a theoretical point of view, they emphasise that there are many aspects of the pathogenesis, prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes that still need to be uncovered. From a practical point of view, they may offer a new strategy to reduce the ongoing epidemic and burden of type 2 diabetes. Peer reviewe...|$|E
