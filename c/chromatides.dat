Ionic radiation is among the most common physical mutagens, benzene, vinylchloride or some drugs represent the chemical mutagens, while some viruses and may act as biological mutagens. The repair mechanisms of double strand breaks can be divided into those that require HRR-homologous sequences and those that may use of microhomologies consisting of a short DNA sequence (NHEJ).

40|$|SUMMARY The present work {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} kinetochore function and structure with respect to Ame 1, a central component of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinetochore. Applying mutant analyses (ame 1 - 2) and biochemical binding assays the following results were obtained: 1. Classical kinetochore functions, chromosome attachment, chromosome segregation, and the supervision of these events by the spindle assembly checkpoint were analyzed in the ame 1 - 2 mutant: • The Ame 1 protein is needed {{for the establishment of}} bipolar attachments to microtubules emanating from opposing poles. Under tension one of the attachments is lost due to a structural weakening of the kinetochore, which results in monopolar segregation of sister <b>chromatides.</b> • Checkpoint analysis revealed that checkpoint functions are not impaired in the mutant, as judged by the inducement of the occupancy checkpoint and the ability of ame 1 - 2 cells to sense their own attachment / tension defect. 2. ame 1 - 2, as also other kinetochore mutants, causes a severe defect in the stability of interpolar microtubules (mitotic spindle). This effect is somewhat surprising, since kinetochores and interpolar microtubules do not interact with each other. Failure in spindle formation caused by kinetochore defects can be explained in two alternative ways: First, kinetochore proteins can also function as spindle stabilizing MAPs (microtubule associated proteins). Second, spindle defects are also observed if a separation of spindle poles occurs in absence of Esp 1 and Cdc 14 activity. Following experimental evidence suggests that the spindle defect in ame 1 - 2 is not due to the above mentioned causes, but rather results from an alternative function of the kinetochore that is compromised in the mutant in a cell cycle dependent manner: • Ame 1 does not locate to the mitotic spindle and thus is not a MAP. • As mentioned above, the ame 1 - 2 mutant fails to achieve a stable bipolar attachment leading to the separation of spindle poles. In parallel the mutant senses this defect and maintains an active spindle assembly checkpoint which inhibits Esp 1 and Cdc 14 activation. As described (Higuchi and Uhlmann, 2005), such a spindle defect can be rescued by overexpression of Esp 1 or Cdc 14. The main cause for the spindle defect in ame 1 - 2 however, is not a spindle pole separation in presence of low Esp 1 or Cdc 14 activity: i) Overexpression of Cdc 14 in ame 1 - 2 does not rescue the spindle defect of the mutant. ii) Overexpression of Esp 1 in ame 1 - 2 does only allow for a partial rescue of the spindle defect. iii) Inactivation of the spindle assembly checkpoint by Mad 2 depletion also leads to only a partial rescue of the spindle defect. iv) A considerable number of cells separate their spindle pole bodies in presence of active Esp 1, but nevertheless display a spindle defect. v) Most spindle defects occur at spindle pole distances that are characteristic of metaphase, when spindle stability is independent of the presence and activity of Esp 1. • The ame 1 - 2 kinetochore defect is more severe (particularly the kinetochore localization of the Mtw 1 complex) when the mutation is induced prior to an establishment of bipolar attachment than after. This differentially compromised kinetochore structure in ame 1 - 2 is apparently reflective of derived kinetochore functions. Similar kinetochore defects (monopolar segregation, failure in Cdc 14 release) are observed, no matter if the mutation is induced before or after bipolar attachment. However, only the latter situation allows for the assembly of wild type metaphase and anaphase spindles. Thus, a certain kinetochore structure (including the Mtw 1 complex) may be involved in generating a spindle stabilizing factor. 3. The present structural model of the S. cerevisiae kinetochore has been refined in the current work by the following findings: • A direct protein interaction network between the Okp 1 / Mtw 1 / Spc 105 / Ndc 80 kinetochore complexes could be established by in vitro binding assays performed with isolated protein complexes. • These data together with those derived from ChIP analyses of the ame 1 - 2 mutant show a clear dependency of the centromeric association of all other central and outer kinetochore complexes on the Okp 1 complex and are thus placing this complex in close proximity to the DNA binding CBF 3 complex. • However, when bipolar attachments are achieved prior to the induction of ame 1 - 2, the localization of the Mtw 1 complex becomes independent of the presence of the Okp 1 complex. The functional characterization of Ame 1 in combination with the biochemical mapping of intra-kinetochore interactions allowed for a structural refinement of the present-state kinetochore model. Moreover, a direct influence of the kinetochore on spindle stability has been uncovered, which may be attributed to the presence of the Mtw 1 complex...|$|E
40|$|In mammals, {{the mouse}} major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) is the only region where breakpoints of meiotic recombination are systematically studied at the molecular level. In the class II region of the MHC, meiotic recombination does not occur at random but are clustered in limited regions known as hotspots. Outside of the hotspots, where recombination scarcely occurs, is called cold regions. Thus far, four hotspots {{have been identified in}} the MHC class II region. The presence or absence of a hotspot depends on the MHC haplotype involved in genetic crosses used to detect recombination. Among the four hotspots, three hotspots have been well characterized at molecular level and their nucleotide sequences were determined. Comparison of the sequences indicated several molecular motifs, such as middle repetitive sequence of MT-family, a sequence similar to a transcription factor binding motif and TCTG or CCTG tetrtamer repetitive sequence, are commonly observed in the three hotspots. It was also reported that the hotspot regions are not always hypersensitive sites to endonuclease Dnase I (Mizuno et al. 1996), suggesting that chromatin structure of the hotspots is not open. Despite studies over almost 15 years since the discovery of the hotspots and findings mentioned above, the mechanism by which the recombinations in this region are restricted to the hotspot is not still clear. In this study, I attempted to address this question by combining of molecular genetical approach and a recently developed cytogenetical approach. First, I carried out the molecular genetical analysis to reveal the structure of the hotspot in the vicinity of Pb gene, which has been left untouched for a long time. The result of this study indicated that the breakpoints of the recombinations are confined to a very short segment of DNA as seen in other three hotspots. Subsequently, comparing the sequences of all four hotspots, I tried to find general features of their molecular structure. From this analysis, I found that all four hotspots were located either in introns or at 32 ̆ 7 end of genes, gut not all 52 ̆ 7 end of genes. In addition, I searched molecular motifs shared by the hotposts in more systematic way. To do this, I surveyed a 1. 3 Mb nucleotide sequence of the whole MHC class II region, which was recently deposited to database, as well as sequences of the all four hotspots. As a result, it appeared that Eb, Lmp 2, Pb hotspots have MT family sequences, and that all four hotsopts have a octamer transcription factor binding motif designated as O motif, B motif-like sequences that is similar to another transcription factor biding motif and the tetramar repetitive sequence. The direction of the O motif and the B motif-like sequences is opposite. The distance between these two motifs is within 300 bp in all four hotspots. The tetramer repetitive sequences are located in DNA segments less than 1. 2 kb in length, which contain the O motif and the B motif-like sequences as well. It is notable that these motifs are also found in a hotspot identified in the mouse MHC class III region, as well as a hotspot identified in the vicinity of TAP 2 gene in the human MHC class II region. All these findings contrast the well established characterizations of the hotspots in budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In budding yeast, their hotspots are located in promoter regions at the 52 ̆ 7 end of genes, which are overlapped with hypersensitive sites to endonuclease DNase I and MNase. Any consensus sequences shared by the yeast hotspots are known. In meiosis, chromatin forms special structure, which shows dynamic changes during the stages of meiosis. In the early stage, sister <b>chromatides</b> remain associated with each other (zygotene to pachytene stage). Then, two copies of homologous chromosome behave in a coordinated fashion. Homologous chromosomes must find their proper partners and physically pair with them along their structure known as the synaptonemal complex (SC). SC consists of the core region and chromatin loops that are anchored to the core region. It is established that RecA homologs, Rad 51 and Dmc 1 proteins, play central roles in the meiotic recombination. In mouse, both of Rad 51 and Dmc 1 are observed on the chromatin from the leptotene to the zygotene stage (Ikeya et al. 1997). In the zygotene stage, the protein complex known as early recombination nodule is observed {{on the inside of the}} two axial elements. In the pachytene stage, Rad 51 protein is localized along the core of SC, and the late recombination nodule, which is protein complex larger than the early recombination nodule, is observed exclusively along the core of the SC. At the stage of segregation of the SC (diplotene to diakinesis stage), chiasmata that are stable connections between homologs and are thought to be cross over points can be seen. Then chiasmata are disassembled and recombination intermediates are resolved. Number of the late recombination nodules is almost equal to chiasmata, implying that the sites of the late recombination nodule are cross over points. This is also supported by the observation that the Rad 51 proteins localized on the late recombinaiton nodules along the core of SC. Previous reports suggested that special sequences play a role in pairing homologous chromosomes in meiosis. For example, painting of the X and Y chromosomes in Drosophila melanogaster is mediated by the rDNA repeats, which are bpresent in two tandem clusters, one in the centromeric X heterochromatin and the other near the teromere of the short arm of the Y chromosome. A block of the tandem repeats on the X chromosome interacts with a similar block on the Y chromosome. Analysis of flies containing transgenic insertions of the rDNA has demonstrated that a 240 bp sequence located in the intergenic spacer region of the rDNA is necessary and sufficient for the pairing (Ren et al. 1997). This report indicates that special sequences act to determine the pairing sites of homologous chromosomes. If, in deed, these special sequences are able to initiate chromosome pairing, it is possible that regions containing such sequences become recombination hotspots. The hotspots in the mouse MHC are not found in promotor regions of 52 ̆ 7 end of genes, where in budding yeast double-strand breaks (DSBs) of DNA occurs and recombination reaction i itiates. This fact also supports the idea that unlike budding yeast, the locations of hte mouse hotspots are determined by the specificity of chromosome pairing sites but not of initiation istes of recombination reaction by DFSBs. If this is the case, it is expected that the mouse hotspots DNA tends to be localized closer to the SC core than cold region DNA in the pachyten stage. In this study, in order to examine this possibility, I carried out cytogenetical analysis to observe topological location of the hotspot and the cold region in relative to the cold region and immuno-staining with antibody for the SC core demonstrated that the hotspot signals localize closer to the SCD core than the signals of the cold region. This result indicates that mouse chromatin loop is not randomly attached to the SC core and the possibility that the hotspot region is specifically used as a landmark in the chromosome pairing, which determines the site of recombination...|$|E

The implication of estrogen in breast cancer has been associated mostly with the estrogen receptors that mediate cell proliferation. Evidence also exists to support the hypothesis of a direct role of estrogens as tumor initiators. However, the role of estrogen genotoxicity in breast cancer is still questionable. In this study the genotoxic activity of catecholestrogens and 16 alpha-hydroxy estrone has been investigated by performing Salmonella strain TA 98 and TA 100 Ames tests, sister <b>chromatide</b> exchange assays (SCE) and micronucleus assays on human peripheral lymphocytes (CBMN and ARA/CBMN). We found a lack of positive results with micronucleus assays, except for 2 -hydroxy estradiol (2 -OHE(2)), which shows a peculiar "bell shaped" trend of micronucleus number versus concentrations. SCE assay suggests weak genotoxic activity of all tested catechol metabolites, except 4 -hydroxy estrone (4 -OHE(1)), which also showed negative results by ARA/CBMN.

When the mean number of <b>chromatide</b> breaks and of cells with aberrations were related to genotypes no statistical difference could be observed between the genotypes for either parameter. No difference in cytogenetic damage between exposed and referents or between smokers and non-smokers were identified for the two separate occupational studies these 80 persons represent. The results of the various cytogenetic endpoints were trichotomized and compared to the genotype distribution. Although not statistically significant, the observed trend with higher percentage of persons with polymorphic   GST p 1 in particular, but also for GST q 1 and mEH (exon 4) in the group with high frequency of chromosome aberrations will be interesting to follow. For further follow-up studies, a nested case-control study within the cohort would give a more rapid and less expensive approach than analysing each study separately as a traditional case-control study. As high frequency of chromosomal damage is associated with cancer development, the hypothesis to be tested would be whether genetic polymorphisms for the most appropriate susceptibility genes could be an explanatory factor for this association. </p...|$|R
