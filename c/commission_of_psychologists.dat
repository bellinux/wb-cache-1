Against this background and {{on the basis of}} a literature study and empirical research, this study aims to provide guidelines to educational psychologists on working with homosexual clients. Within the Educational Psychology, a person's self actualisation rests on three pilars, namely experience, meaning assignation and involvement. The premise of the qualitative research (focus group interviews) used in this study is homosexual persons' experience <b>of</b> <b>psychologists</b> - the investigation was therefore approached from an Educational Psychology viewpoint. Altogether 75 % of the focus group respondents' experience <b>of</b> <b>psychologists</b> was negative. The possibility exists that insufficient training may cause insufficient knowledge and insight, which in turn may lead to homosexual persons' negative experiences <b>of</b> <b>psychologists.</b> It is therefore imperative that the aspect <b>of</b> training <b>of</b> <b>psychologists</b> with regard to homosexuality will receive attention.

40|$|The {{public image}} <b>of</b> <b>psychologists</b> has been thrown into sharp focus {{recently}} {{due to the}} increasing importance of mental {{health care in the}} community. Recent changes to the Medicare system in Australia that have increased psychologists' involvement in the provision of mental health interventions, and debate in the profession regarding the training <b>of</b> future <b>psychologists</b> have intensified this focus. The current thesis is an applied psychological investigation presenting four separate but thematically connected studies investigating the issue of the public image <b>of</b> <b>psychologists.</b> This thesis begins from the premise that the public perception <b>of</b> <b>psychologists</b> is formed by the interaction of many different sources of information and experience; it explores how intersecting perspectives, agendas, and sources of information work together in the formation of shared social understandings of what psychology is. Using a methodological approach based on social representations theory, the thesis addresses the issue of public perception <b>of</b> <b>psychologists</b> and psychology in a range of different sites, in order to produce a multifaceted, contextually sensitive understanding of the construct. The first study investigated possible methodological approaches that can be used when examining public perception and recommended the qualitative approach as an adjunct to the previously employed quantitative studies. Previous quantitative studies have outlined the confusion that exists in understanding the roles <b>of</b> <b>psychologists</b> and psychiatrists, and the first study in this thesis confirmed this finding from a qualitative perspective. The second study presented an analysis of the role of psychology's major professional association in Australia, the APS, on the public image of psychology. A number of prominent themes on the APS website including the difference between psychologists and psychiatrists, the accessibility <b>of</b> <b>psychologists,</b> and the effectiveness of psychological interventions were discussed and a range of extracts were analysed to show some {{of the ways in which}} the APS actively manages the public image <b>of</b> <b>psychologists</b> in order to promote and advance the profession. The third study provided a contrasting example of the APS tailoring their message to a very specific audience by analysing a series of written submissions to the Australian federal government to advocate on behalf <b>of</b> <b>psychologists</b> for the inclusion of psychological interventions on the Medicare rebate. The final study investigated General Practitioners' (GPs') perceptions <b>of</b> <b>psychologists,</b> particularly in light of the recent Medicare changes in Australia. The data suggested that GPs find the current system cumbersome, and that these major "gatekeepers" of mental health care often lack a clear understanding of the specific skills and training <b>of</b> <b>psychologists.</b> One <b>of</b> the major themes surrounding the public perception <b>of</b> <b>psychologists</b> revealed in this thesis was the interplay between the already existing confusion in the public mind about the role <b>of</b> <b>psychologists,</b> and the efforts of the APS to actively promote a broad role for <b>psychologists</b> as providers <b>of</b> both general counselling and specialist mental health services. These findings were used to argue for further investigation into the issue of public perception of psychology, and to engage with current debates within psychology in Australia about the importance of finding a balance between presenting a flexible public face of psychology (resulting in a broad referral base), and propagating a more tightly drawn public face of the profession (potentially restricting market share but helping to sharpen the somewhat indistinct public image of the profession) (Littlefield, 2009) ...|$|R

30|$|Other recent surveys {{suggest that}} the {{majority}} of mental health professionals, as well as other professionals such as physicians and child welfare personnel, do not support the use of physical punishment. In one study, three-fourths of professionals believed that spanking is a “bad disciplinary technique” (Taylor, Fleckman, & Lee, 2017). In Gershoff et al.’s (2016) study of medical center staff, only about 15 % agreed that “sometimes {{the only way to get}} a child to behave is with a spank.” Similarly, Miller-Perrin and Rush (Miller-Perrin C. & Rush, R: Attitudes, knowledge, practices, and ethical beliefs <b>of</b> <b>psychologists</b> related to spanking: A survey of American Psychological Association division members, submitted) found that only 15 % <b>of</b> <b>psychologists</b> agreed that “sometimes the only way to get a child to behave is with a spank.” Furthermore, when this group <b>of</b> <b>psychologists</b> was asked whether spanking is a more appropriate part of parenting for some groups than others, such as some ethnic and religious groups, only 32 % and 26 %, respectively, agreed or strongly agreed. Many professionals are also changing their views about whether spanking represents an important ethical issue. In a survey <b>of</b> <b>psychologists</b> conducted in 2000, just one third <b>of</b> <b>psychologists</b> believed it was unethical to recommend that a parent use spanking. By 2016, that number had risen to 76 % (Miller-Perrin C. & Rush, R: Attitudes, knowledge, practices, and ethical beliefs <b>of</b> <b>psychologists</b> related to spanking: A survey of American Psychological Association division members, submitted). According to these studies, a majority of professionals who work with children believe that spanking should be avoided.|$|R
