25|$|The players (or teams) {{start on}} {{opposite}} sides of the net. One player is designated the server, and the opposing player is the receiver. The choice to be server or receiver in the first game and the choice of ends is decided by a coin toss before the warm-up starts. Service alternates game by game between the two players (or teams). For each point, the server starts behind the baseline, between the <b>center</b> <b>mark</b> and the sideline. The receiver may start anywhere on their side of the net. When the receiver is ready, the server will serve, although the receiver must play to the pace of the server.|$|E
25|$|The {{lines that}} {{delineate}} {{the width of}} the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court). The short mark {{in the center of each}} baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the <b>center</b> <b>mark.</b> The outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines. These are the boundaries used when doubles is being played. The lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines and are used as boundaries in singles play. The area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley, which is considered playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the center of a player's side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side. Despite its name, this is not where a player legally stands when making a serve.|$|E

25|$|Oklahoma City {{remained}} in the same division after an American Hockey League realignment {{in the summer of}} 2013, but it was renamed from the South Division to the West Division. Todd Nelson started his fourth year as Barons head coach in the 2013–14 season, despite rumors that he may depart following his disappointment with being passed over as the Edmonton Oilers coach after Ralph Krueger's departure. Nelson has two years remaining on his contract and said, but said he may explore job opportunities at other organizations in the future. The Barons saw several departures in the off-season, such as forwards Philippe Cornet, Darcy Hordichuk, Kristiāns Pelšs, and Chris VandeVelde; defensemen Randy Jones and Jordan Henry; and veteran goaltender Yann Danis. <b>Center</b> <b>Mark</b> Arcobello, an AHL-All Star and the team's all-time leading scorer, made the Edmonton roster. Winger Curtis Hamilton remained on the team, but injured his knee in a practice after {{the first game of the}} season and would not start right away. Newcomers to the team included forwards Travis Ewanyk, Matthew Ford, Austin Fyten, Ryan Hamilton, Ryan Jones, Kale Kessy, Philip Larsen, Andrew Miller, Nicholas Tremblay, and Derek Nesbitt; defensemen Martin Gernat, Brad Hunt, Oscar Klefbom and David Musil; and goaltender Richard Bachman, who was backup goal for NHL's Dallas Stars for the last two seasons. Winger Linus Omark, who had previously played for the Barons and Oilers but spent last season with the Swiss team EV Zug, returned to a one-year agreement with Oklahoma City. The new Oklahoma City roster included a mix of young and veteran forwards, as well as a young core of defensemen, with six of the starting eight between ages 20 and 22, as well as Hunt and Taylor Fedun, both of whom were 25.|$|E
500|$|In August 2005, Long {{suffered}} an ankle injury and was sidelined as the 2005 Michigan Wolverines football team's season began. [...] The injury had been caused {{in training camp}} when he was zone blocking alongside <b>center</b> <b>Mark</b> Bihl, who got tangled up with nose tackle Gabe Watson. [...] The two fell against the outside of Long's leg and rolled over it. [...] The injury required surgery. Long {{did not return to}} the lineup until October 22 on the third possession against the Iowa Hawkeyes. He was the lead blocker on the game-winning overtime touchdown. He started the game the subsequent week against the Northwestern Wildcats. [...] Two weeks later, following a bye week, Long got injured during the first half against the Indiana Hoosiers, and his foot was put in a protective boot. [...] The second foot injury was expected to end his season. [...] He appeared in the subsequent rivalry game against the Ohio State Buckeyes, and during the first play, he opposed Bobby Carpenter and Carpenter got a broken leg. After the game, Long appeared to need immediate surgery, which would have caused him to miss the 2005 Alamo Bowl. By the time of the game on December 28, though, he was ready to play. [...] As the team prepared for 2006 spring practice, the left-handed Long was moved from right tackle to left tackle where he would be protecting the blindside of right-handed quarterbacks.|$|E
500|$|After {{the first}} five games, all losses, Jeff Carter {{suffered}} a broken foot that {{kept him out of}} the line-up for 10 games. While Carter was injured, the Blue Jackets continued to lose games. In the eighth game of the year, they had a chance to end the losing streak against the Ottawa Senators. Columbus held a 3–2 lead with under a minute to play. Jason Spezza tied the game on a late power play, and with just 4.7 seconds remaining, Milan Michalek notched the winning goal for the Senators. The loss helped set a franchise record for futility with a 0–7–1 record to start a season. The losing streak came to an end three days later with a win over the Detroit Red Wings. During the game, several milestones were reached. James Wisniewski made his Columbus debut, Ryan Johansen and John Moore scored their first career NHL goals and Grant Clitsome had a career-high three assists. Columbus was unable to create any momentum from the win, however, and continued to struggle, culminating in a 2–12–1 record, which was the worst start to an NHL season for any team in 19 years. With the team struggling, management attempted to [...] "shake things up" [...] by making some roster moves. The first move was the acquisition of <b>center</b> <b>Mark</b> Letestu from the Pittsburgh Penguins. Next, they traded defenseman Kris Russell to the St. Louis Blues for Nikita Nikitin. As the clubs slow start continued, there were rumors that Head Coach Scott Arniel would be fired and replaced with Ken Hitchcock. Hitchcock had previously coached the Blue Jackets to their only playoff appearance in club history and was still under contract with the franchise through {{to the end of the}} season. Before any of these rumors came to fruition, the St. Louis Blues asked Columbus for permission to hire Hitchcock, which the Blue Jackets allowed. Hitchcock began his Blues coaching career with a 6–1–2 record in his first nine games, while Columbus amassed a 6–13–3 record to start the season.|$|E

2500|$|In a legal service, {{the ball}} travels over the net (without {{touching}} it) {{and into the}} diagonally opposite service box. If the ball hits the net but lands in the service box, this is a let or net service, which is void, and the server retakes that serve. The player can serve any number of let services in a point and they are always treated as voids and not as faults. A fault is a serve that falls long or wide of the service box, or does not clear the net. There is also a [...] "foot fault", which occurs when a player's foot touches the baseline or {{an extension of the}} <b>center</b> <b>mark</b> before the ball is hit. If the second service is also a fault, the server double faults, and the receiver wins the point. However, if the serve is in, it is considered a legal service.|$|E

Ford was picked eighth {{in the first round}} by the Milwaukee Bucks in a very strong draft class, which featured future NBA All-Stars LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and Carmelo Anthony. In his first season, he led the Bucks in assists with 6.5 assists per game, while tallying 7.1 points per game (ppg). Ford was also selected to the NBA All-Rookie 2nd Team. However, he played in only 55 games that season before an injury forced him to miss the final 26 games of the regular season and the 2004 NBA Playoffs. The injury occurred on February 24, 2004, during a home game versus the Minnesota Timberwolves where he fell on his tail bone after being fouled by <b>center</b> <b>Mark</b> Madsen. He suffered a contusion of the spinal cord, a career-threatening injury.|$|E
