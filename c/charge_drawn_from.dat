40|$|We propose charge {{recycling}} (CR) {{to reduce}} power con-sumption in FPGAs. We {{take advantage of}} the property that many routing conductors are left unused in any FPGA im-plementation of an application. Charge recycling via the un-used conductors reduces the amount of <b>charge</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> the supply, lowering energy consumption. We present a routing switch that operates in two modes: normal and CR, and describe the CAD tool changes needed to support CR at the routing and post-routing stages of the flow. Results show that dynamic power in the FPGA interconnect can be reduced by∼ 15 - 18. 4 % by the proposed techniques, depend-ing on the performance constraints. 1...|$|E
40|$|This article problematizes how Critical Terrorism Studies (CTS) {{utilizes}} Coxian and Frankfurt School Critical Theory {{to support}} an emancipatory project. The article broadly takes the example of CTS to illustrate {{the dangers of the}} ‘pearl fishing’ method, occasionally used within critical international relations, where a section of a philosophical position is appropriated without regard for the whole. As Horkheimerian Critical Theory relies upon a far broader philosophy than CTS acknowledges, it is argued that the appropriated emancipatory foundation cannot make sense in soundbite form. Such stunted interaction with the wider philosophy of Critical Theory leaves CTS susceptible to the charge of logical error, specifically that contained in the ‘naturalistic fallacy’. The naturalistic fallacy is a <b>charge</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> the philosophy of logic that takes improper derivation of ‘ought’ from ‘is’ within argumentation as its referent. The relationship between international relations and Critical Theory {{does not have to be}} so unsatisfactory, however, and this article concludes with suggestions for a route whereby emancipatory commitment might be adopted without such problems of normative origination...|$|E
40|$|Urban Search and Rescue is a {{dangerous}} task for rescue workers {{and for this reason}} the use of mobile robots to carry out the search of the environment is becoming common place. These robots are remotely operated and the search is carried out by the robot operator. This work proposes that common search algorithms can be used to guide a single autonomous mobile robot in a search of an environment and locate survivors within the environment. This work then goes on to propose that multiple robots, guided by the same search algorithms, will carry out this task in a quicker time. The work presented is split into three distinct parts. The first is the development of a nonlinear mathematical model for a mobile robot. The model developed is validated against a physical system. A suitable navigation and control system is required to direct the robot to a target point within an environment. This is the second part of this work. The final part of this work presents the search algorithms used. The search algorithms generate the target points which allow the robot to search the environment. These algorithms are based on traditional and modern search algorithms that will enable a single mobile robot to search an area autonomously. The best performing algorithms from the single robot case are then adapted to a multi robot case. The mathematical model presented in the thesis describes the dynamics and kinematics of a four wheeled mobile ground based robot. The model is developed to allow the design and testing of control algorithms offline. With the model and accompanying simulation the search algorithms can be quickly and repeatedly tested without practical installation. The mathematical model is used as the basis of design for the manoeuvring control algorithm and the search algorithms. This design process is based on simulation studies. In the first instance the control methods investigated are Proportional-Integral-Derivative, Pole Placement and Sliding Mode. Each method is compared using the tracking error, the steady state error, the rise time, the <b>charge</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> the battery and the ability to control the robot through a simple motion. Obstacle avoidance is also covered as part of the manoeuvring control algorithm. The final aspect investigated is the search algorithms. The following search algorithms are investigated, Lawnmower, Random, HillClimbing, Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms. Variations on these algorithms are also investigated. The variations are based on Tabu Search. Each of the algorithms is investigated in a single robot case with the best performing investigated within a multi robot case. A comparison between the different methods is made based on the percentage of the area covered within the time available, the number of targets located and the time taken to locate targets. It is shown that in the single robot case the best performing algorithms have high random elements and some structure to selecting points. Within the multi robot case it is shown that some algorithms work well and others do not. It is also shown that the useable number of robots is dependent {{on the size of the}} environment. This thesis concludes with a discussion on the best control and search algorithms, as indicated by the results, for guiding single and multiple autonomous mobile robots. The advantages of the methods are presented, as are the issues with using the methods stated. Suggestions for further work are also presented.

50|$|The {{red cross}} {{refers to the}} village’s former {{allegiance}} to the Bishopric of Trier. The seven lozenges, too, recall a former allegiance, this one to the County of Virneburg. This <b>charge</b> is <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> the Counts’ old arms. The palm frond and the arrow are Saint Sebastian’s attributes, with the palm frond symbolizing Sebastian’s survival of an execution by bow and arrow {{as a sign of}} victory, for according to legend, Sebastian was nursed back to health after he was believed to be dead. The blue bendlet sinister stands for the brook that runs through the village, also called the Mannebach; it is the municipality’s namesake.|$|R

50|$|The <b>charges</b> are all <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> Dörbach’s and Salmrohr’s history. Salmrohr {{and part}} of Dörbach were once under the lordship of the Knights of Esch, which {{accounts}} for the arms’ similarity to those borne by that municipality. However, in Salmtal’s arms, the “vair” pattern (called Eisenhutfeh in German, or “iron hat fur”, {{a reference to the}} helmetlike shapes) appears only on the sinister (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) side, with an anchor charge on the dexter (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) side.

50|$|The lion (Löwe) {{is perhaps}} {{somewhat}} confusingly also called a leopard in the German blazon. This confusion also arises in English heraldry, with “leopard” often being the word used {{in earlier times}} for a cat charge in this particular attitude, namely “passant” (that is, striding along). James Parker, though, holds that “lion” was the usual term for both in later times, and that practically the same creature was meant, anyway. Whichever the cat is meant to be, the <b>charge</b> is <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> the arms once borne by the Knights of Steinkallenfels, who were {{as early as the}} 12th century the lords of the Kellenbach high court and held lands in Henau, which itself was part of the high court’s territory. The cat also recalls the Knights of Kellenbach, who were among the Steinkallenfelses’ descendants, and in the 13th century, were also part-owners of the Kellenbach high court. The “chequy” pattern below the line of partition refers to the Counts of Sponheim. It was they who held Koppenstein Castle, now within Henau’s municipal limits, and they also held a share of the Kellenbach court. The buckle stands for yet another knightly family, the Knights of Schmidtburg, who were likewise part-owners of the Kellenbach high court, and who later also came into ownership of Koppenstein Castle.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{domestic}} charging of electric vehicles (EVs) on electricity demand {{at a national}} level was addressed. A study case was created to investigate how different charging regimes (i. e. control policies) and EV-uptake levels will affect the electricity demand of Great Britain (GB) and Spain in 2030. Charging rates, battery capacities, and battery and <b>charger</b> effi-ciencies were <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> literature. Traffic patterns were acquired from the British Department for Transport and the Spanish Ministry of Public Works. Uncontrolled, dual tariff (time-based control), dynamic price (price-based control) domestic charging regimes were defined and applied to both power systems for different EV utilization levels. The results show that for low EV utilization, the GB system {{would be able to}} cope with the increased demand that EV domestic charging would create. The Spanish system would need additional generation to cover the EV charging needs. The anticipated high EV utilization would almost double peak the demand in both countries...|$|R

5000|$|Universal life {{insurance}} (often shortened to UL) {{is a type}} of cash value {{life insurance}}, sold primarily in the United States of America. Under the terms of the policy, the excess of premium payments above the current cost of insurance is credited to the cash value of the policy. The cash value is credited each month with interest, and the policy is debited each month by a cost of insurance (COI) charge, as well as any other policy <b>charges</b> and fees <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> the cash value, even if no premium payment is made that month. Interest credited to the account is determined by the insurer, but has a contractual minimum rate (often 2%). When an earnings rate is pegged to a financial index such as a stock, bond or other interest rate index, the policy is an [...] "Indexed Universal Life" [...] contract. These types of policies offer the advantage of guaranteed level premiums throughout the insured's lifetime at substantially lower premium cost than an equivalent whole life policy at first; the cost of insurance is always increasing as found on the cost index table (usually p. 3 of a contract). This not only allows for easy comparison of costs between carriers, but also works well in irrevocable life insurance trusts (ILIT's) since cash is of no consequence.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, there has been growing {{interest}} in {{a new class of}} space propulsion for smaller satellites in low Earth orbit that utilize highly charged and accelerated nanoparticles (Nanoparticle Field Extraction Thruster or NanoFET) or liquid droplets (colloidal thrusters) to provide thrust. As with any electric propulsion system that emits charged particles, an issue to be examined is how to ensure charge neutral operation. Specifically, this work investigates potential methods to self-neutralize or use the surrounding ambient ionospheric plasma to avoid the complexity of an additional neutralization sub-system. The NanoFET system operates by charging and expelling either positively or negatively <b>charged</b> nanoparticles <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> a dry powder through a MEMS-based sieve and grid structure. Similarly, colloidal thrusters charge liquid droplet particles to either polarity. This ability to charge particles to either polarity offers the possibility to use the particles themselves to self-neutralize the system. Common in-space electric propulsion systems only emit positive ion propellant, which requires that electrons be separately emitted, using hollow cathodes or other electron emitters. If NanoFET and colloidal thrusters did not need a separate sub-system for neutralization, it would improve efficiency and reduce complexity. Plausible options to neutralize NanoFET and colloidal thrusters with as little increase in complexity as possible are to emit equal amounts of oppositely charged particles by either (i) simultaneous emission from separate locations (ii) emission from a single location with periodic polarity change, or (iii) emission of a negatively charged nanoparticle beam into a background plasma that can provide an electron return current. Even smaller than the satellites that NanoFET and colloidal thrusters are envisioned for providing propulsion to are a class of satellites called femtosatellites. Femtosatellites require unconventional means of propulsion due to their low mass, power, and size budget, with one possible propulsion technique being electrodynamic tethers. An area of study for the electrodynamically tethered femtosatellite system is the electron emission scheme either through a field emitter array cathode or a thermionic cathode/hot filament...|$|R
