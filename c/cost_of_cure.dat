5000|$|As the Scripture says, he [...] "shall {{cause him}} to be {{thoroughly}} healed" [...] (Ex. xxi. 19), the inference is that the guilty party shall pay for {{the services of a}} physician. He may not offer his own services, no matter what his skill may be; nor can he avoid the outlay of money by finding a physician that will do the healing work free of charge. Should ulcers arise in consequence of a wound, the cost of healing such ulcers also falls on the assailant; but if ulcers arise from other causes—for instance, because the wounded man disregards the orders of his physician—the cost of healing these is not to be assessed. The wound may disappear and break out again and again: the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure</b> will still rest on the assailant; but if it be once fully healed (literally, [...] "to its full need"), the liability comes to an end (B.

The occasion for <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure</b> may exist without any of the other elements of damage; for instance, where one has forcibly thrown chemicals upon another, giving to his skin the whiteness of leprosy, it is his duty to pay the cost of having the skin restored to a healthy color (B.

When parties complained of injuries, the judges, after hearing their allegations and the testimony of witnesses, indicated the sum that in their opinion the assailant should pay, and, upon his refusal, would threaten him with excommunication ("nidduy"); and this course would generally have the desired effect.

In the first class of games, nodes choose their curing rates to minimize the steady-state infection probability under the degree-based mean-field approximation plus the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> their selected <b>curing</b> rate. We establish the existence of pure Nash equilibria under both risk neutral and behavioral decision-makers. When the per-unit <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> rate is sufficiently high, we show that risk neutral players choose the curing rate to be zero at the equilibrium, while curing rate is nonzero under behavioral decision-making for any finite cost.

Thirty six pieces of raw sheep skins were obtained from Alkadero slaughterhouse. According to the type of salt, level of added biocide and method of preservation used, the pieces of raw sheepskins were allocated into 9 groups. Three groups received dry salting without biocide viz, 30 % (control), 25 % dry salting and 30 % dry reused salt. Six groups were wet salted in brine of 30 % and 25 % reused salt viz and 3 level of biocide (0. 2 %, 0. 4 % and 0. 6 %).

To determine the sensitivity <b>of</b> the <b>cost</b> effectiveness analysis to {{variation in the}} probability of developing sequelae. METHODS: A decision tree was constructed to evaluate health effects of the programme, such as averted sequelae <b>of</b> chlamydial infection. <b>Cost</b> effectiveness from a societal perspective was estimated for screening {{by means of a}} ligase chain reaction on mailed, home obtained urine specimens, in a population with a C trachomatis test prevalence of 2. 9 %. An extensive sensitivity analysis was performed for the probability of sequelae, the percentage of preventable pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and the discount rate. RESULTS: The estimated net <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> one woman, aged 15 - 40 years, of a C trachomatis infection is US$ 1210. To prevent one major outcome (PID, tubal factor infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, or neonatal pneumonia), 479 women would have to be screened. The net <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> preventing one major outcome is $ 15 800. Changing the probability of PID after chlamydial infection from 5 % to 25 % decreases the net cost per major outcome averted from $ 28 300 to $ 6380, a reduction of 78 %. Results were less sensitive to variations in estimates for other sequelae. The breakeven prevalence of the programme ranges from 6. 4 % for the scenario with all probabilities for complications set at the maximum value to a prevalence of 100 % for probabilities set at the minimum value.

Molecular docking was used to explore structural motifs responsible for the interactions between triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) from Plasmodium falciparum (PFTIM) and human (HTIM) tissues. Fourteen antimalarial drugs were examined. The binding affinities and domains identified serve as a basis for modeling novel analogues. For all drugs modeled, PFTIM complexes displayed stronger binding affinities compared to HTIM. A dissociation constant (KI) of 40. 2 mM was obtained for the interaction between primaquine and HTIM and 1. 22 mM with PFTIM. This represents a 33 -fold increase in selective binding to PFTM compared to HTIM. Mefloquine shows a 24 -fold increase, and one new test ligand showed 25 -fold increase in binding. The dimer interface and other pocket close to the active site are the main pockets observed by the docking studies. Key residues at the dimer interphase (Y 48, D 49, V 46, S 45, E 65, S 211) form a tight pocket with favorable polar contacts. 75 % of PFTIM ligand complexes preferred the dimer interphase suggesting a potential site for non-competitive inhibition.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of the global programme against lymphatic filariasis is eradication through irrevocable cessation of transmission using 4 to 6 years of annual single dose mass drug administration. The <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> eradication, and logistical and managerial impediments to executing national and regional control programmes, and scientific uncertainty about transmission endpoints, are challenges {{to the success of}} this effort, especially in areas of high endemicity where financial resources are limited. We used a combined analysis of empirical community data describing the association between infection and chronic disease prevalence, mathematical modelling, and economic analyses to identify and evaluate the feasibility of setting an infection target level at which the chronic pathology attributable to lymphatic filariasis - lymphoedema of the extremities (elephantiasis) and hydroceles - becomes negligible in the face of continuing transmission as a first stage option in achieving the elimination of this parasitic disease. The results show that microfilaria prevalences below a threshold of 3. 55 % at a blood sampling volume of 1 ml could constitute readily achievable and sustainable targets to control disease due to lymphatic filariasis. They also show {{that as a result of}} the high marginal <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> the last few individuals to achieve elimination, maximal benefits can occur at the disease control threshold. Indeed, a key finding from our coupled economic and epidemiological analysis is that when initial uncertainty regarding eradication occurs and prospects for improving information to resolve such uncertainty over time exist, it is economically beneficial to adopt a flexible, sequential, eradication strategy based on controlling chronic disease initially. These results suggest that it may be optimal to set phased targets for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis, starting with disease control followed by intensified efforts to eradicate transmission as better knowledge regarding transmission dynamics and issues of implementation feasibility becomes evident. They also illustrate the importance of taking explicit accounts of uncertainties, multi-staged endpoints, and the value of embedding flexibility in the decision making process when determining optimal parasite eradication strategies...|$|R

This population-based study aimed to investigate the burden of chronic diseases and health costs for HIV+ subjects compared {{to the general population}} living in Brescia Local health Agency (LHA) over a 12 -year period. Methods LHA database recorded diagnoses, deaths, drug prescriptions and health resource utilization for all residents during 2003 – 2014. We estimated HIV prevalence and incidence, HIV-related mortality as well as prevalence of chronic diseases in HIV+ subjects. Observed/expected ratio of chronic diseases was calculated by indirect standardization with the general population as reference. Direct <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> HIV care and determinants were estimates across the period. Results HIV prevalence increased from 220 to 307 per 100 000 person-years while incidence decreased from 16. 1 to 10. 8 per 100 000 person-years from 2003 to 2014. Prevalence of most comorbidities increased over time but it reduced significantly (annual mean change[*]−[*] 0. 7  %) when adjusting for age and gender. Observed to expected ratio for each chronic disease in HIV+ subjects decreased over time. <b>Cost</b> <b>of</b> HIV+ <b>cures</b> increased (+ 25  %) mainly due to cost for drugs (+ 50  %) but it stabilized in recent years.

Major drawbacks include the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> installing solar systems and also problems with theft. But in Malawi, a project working with tobacco farmers is proving that solar-generated electricity can play a useful part in agricultural production. The project is focusing on the <b>curing</b> <b>of</b> tobacco; this is the process by which green tobacco leaves are carefully dried under controlled conditions, in order to preserve the aroma and the valued chemicals in the leaves, ready for sale and manufacturing into cigarettes. <b>Curing</b> <b>of</b> tobacco often requires large quantities of firewood, and has been blamed for deforestation. So could the solar-powered process be a more environmentally friendly method? To find out how the system works, Excello Zidana went to the Ministry of Energy and Mining to meet Chief Energy Officer, Lewis Mhango. Mr Mhango began by explaining how the tobacco curing process works. IN:	?The normal way <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> tobacco ? OUT:	? the properties of those fruits. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 01 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mhango	The normal way <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> tobacco, especially flue-cured tobacco, is they dig a hole in the wall and then they stock firewood in a fire chamber, and then the normal flow of air takes the flues into the flue pipes, and then the heat is emitted in the room and then the tobacco gets cured. But the use of solar fans has revolutionised the process <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> tobacco, especially for smallholder farmers. Because what it does is that you have a solar panel, and then that solar panel is connected to a battery, and then the power is preserved in the battery during the day. And then at night you plug in, it is connected to a solar fan, which is a DC fan. So this fan is put at the fire chamber. So the fan drives the flues into the flue pipes from the fire chamber. Now that forced draught into the flue pipes, you can control the temperature very easily, one. Two, you can dry the tobacco very fast, since you are able to control the temperature it means you reach the required temperatures very easily, and then you control at that particular time, so the tobacco that maybe takes one week to cure, you can do it in three days. So the time is also reduced, and then the amount of firewood is also reduced. The savings are phenomenal, that?s why farmers have liked the solar fans. So the process is a combination of a solar powered fan and a little firewood. Zidana	So in the process, the function of the fan is to regulate the heat? Mhango	Yes, definitely. To regulate the heat, and to regulate the heat {{in such a way that}} if you want higher heat quicker, you can attain it very fast with a solar fan. While if you use the natural flow, it means you have to keep on stocking and stocking the firewood and then your heap is finishing, you need more firewood. But with this one, with the little firewood that you have, you force the draught quickly, the draught is going out in there, in the process the solar fan is also keeping the fire always burning, so that you generate the heat faster. Zidana	Is there any difference in quality of tobacco between the two systems, the one that uses the solar powered energy and the other one that uses maybe the fuel without the solar powered energy? Mhango	Yes, the difference is quite phenomenal. The target is to get a gold leaf, which is favoured on the auction floors. So with a solar powered fan, because you are able to control the temperatures, then you can maintain the temperatures for sometime, and then the colouring, the gold colouring, you can even monitor using a thermometer in terms of the temperature. So you attain the required temperature very easily using the solar fan. Zidana	And what are the probable advantages or disadvantages of this system? Mhango	The major advantage is, as I say, it reduces your <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> the tobacco, one. Two, the amount of firewood people are using is reduced, therefore you are also reducing deforestation. The third advantage is that the quality of leaf is excellent, and then the farmer fetches higher amounts of money at the auction floors, because he is able to produce good quality tobacco. But there are also some disadvantages. The major disadvantage is the initial <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> solar is quite high, although if the farmer plans properly he can still recover the cost within a short period of time, because the quality of the tobacco will fetch higher amounts of money, and therefore he can recover his money quickly. And again, if you have solar, when you are through with your tobacco curing, the solar you can also connect to lights in your house, you can also play your radio, you can also have your TV. Zidana	So you kill several birds with one stone? Mhango	With one stone. Zidana	Now, does this system need to be for large-scale curing or drying, or would it be possible to have a smaller scale version of the technology? Mhango	Yes, when we started the project we were trying to look at the possibility of having large farms to use the solar, because <b>of</b> the <b>cost.</b> But we did discover that the amount of tobacco that goes through large farms is quite huge, that the solar fan would not be ideal for large farms. So we are targeting smallholder farmers. These are the farmers who produce between 5, 000 and 10, 000 kg of tobacco a year. Zidana	And what other crops might this kind of system be relevant for? Mhango	It could be relevant for preserving vegetables, and probably there is also the possibility of maybe preserving fruits, but for fruit preservation we need a bit more research to make sure that it will not denature the properties of those fruits.

A total of 137 patients, aged 15 - 60 years, attending a malaria clinic were followed for 28 days, 60 of them received quinine + tetracycline and 77 received artesunate. Cure rates were assessed on day 5 (artesunate) and day 7 (quinine + tetracycline), using the intention-to-treat approach. Cost-effectiveness and sensitivity analyses were performed by varying the day 5 /day 7 curative effectiveness and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> artesunate. The <b>cure</b> rate with artesunate (100 %) was significantly higher than with quinine + tetracycline (77. 4 %) (relative risk adjusted for sex (aRR) = 1. 32, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 12 - 1. 55; referent quinine + tetracycline). Artesunate was more cost-effective than quinine + tetracycline at the following costs: artesunate, < or = US$ 0. 36 per 50 -mg tablet; quinine, US$ 0. 06 per 300 -mg tablet; tetracycline, US$ 0. 02 per 250 -mg capsule; and services per case found, < or = US$ 11. 49.
