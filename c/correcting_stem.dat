40|$|ABSTRACT: Determination of {{the total}} {{structure}} of molecular nanocrystals is an outstanding experimental challenge that has been met, {{in only a few}} cases, by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Described here is an alternative approach that is of most general applicability and does not require the fabrication of a single crystal. The method is based on rapid, time-resolved nanobeam electron diffraction (NBD) combined with high-angle annular dark field scanning/transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images in a probe <b>corrected</b> <b>STEM</b> microscope, operated at reduced voltages. The results are compared with theoretical simulations of images and diffraction patterns obtained from atomistic structural models derived through first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The method is demonstrated by application to determination {{of the structure of the}} Au 144 (SCH 2 CH 2 Ph) 60 cluster.

Before roots are extracted, they are checked against a predefined list of 3800 triliteral and 900 quad literal roots.

40|$|There is a {{widespread}} agreement from patient and professional organisations alike that the safety of stem cell therapeutics is of paramount importance, particularly for ex vivo autologous gene therapy. Yet current technology {{makes it difficult to}} thoroughly evaluate the behaviour of genetically <b>corrected</b> <b>stem</b> cells before they are transplanted. To address this, we have developed a strategy that permits transplantation of a clonal population of genetically <b>corrected</b> autologous <b>stem</b> cells that meet stringent selection criteria and the principle of precaution. As a proof of concept, we have stably transduced epidermal stem cells (holoclones) obtained from a patient suffering from recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Holoclones were infected with self-inactivating retroviruses bearing a COL 7 A 1 cDNA and cloned before the progeny of individual stem cells were characterised using a number of criteria. Clonal analysis revealed a great deal of heterogeneity among transduced stem cells in their capacity to produce functional type VII collagen (COLVII). Selected transduced stem cells transplanted onto immunodeficient mice regenerated a non-blistering epidermis for months and produced a functional COLVII. Safety was assessed by determining the sites of proviral integration, rearrangements and hit genes and by whole-genome sequencing. The progeny of the selected stem cells also had a diploid karyotype, was not tumorigenic and did not disseminate after long-term transplantation onto immunodeficient mice. In conclusion, a clonal strategy is a powerful and efficient means of by-passing the heterogeneity of a transduced stem cell population. It guarantees a safe and homogenous medicinal product, fulfilling the principle of precaution and the requirements of regulatory affairs. Furthermore, a clonal strategy makes it possible to envision exciting gene-editing technologies like zinc finger nucleases, TALENs and homologous recombination for next-generation gene therapy...|$|R
40|$|The nanogrowth and {{nanofabrication}} {{of solid}} substances using an intense and focused electron beam are reviewed {{in terms of}} the application of scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM and STEM) to control the size, position and structure of nanomaterials. The first example discussed is the growth of freestanding nanotrees on insulator substrates by TEM. The growth process of the nanotrees was observed in situ and analyzed by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and was mainly controlled by the intensity of the electron beam. The second example is position- and size-controlled nanofabrication by STEM using a focused electron beam. The diameters of the nanostructures grown ranged from 4 to 20 nm {{depending on the size of}} the electron beam. Magnetic nanostructures were also obtained using an iron-containing precursor gas, Fe(CO) 5. The freestanding iron nanoantennas were examined by electron holography. The magnetic field was observed to leak from the nanostructure body which appeared to act as a 'nanomagnet'. The third example described is the effect of a vacuum on the size and growth process of fabricated nanodots containing W in an ultrahigh-vacuum field-emission TEM (UHV-FE-TEM). The size of the dots can be controlled by changing the dose of electrons and the partial pressure of the precursor. The smallest particle size obtained was about 1. 5 nm in diameter, which is the smallest size reported using this method. Finally, the importance of a smaller probe and a higher electron-beam current with atomic resolution is emphasized and an attempt to develop an ultrahigh-vacuum spherical aberration <b>corrected</b> <b>STEM</b> (Cs-corrected STEM) at NIMS is reported...|$|R

We show that the taxon explained four times more variance in individual stem breakage than did stand level properties; trees with higher specific leaf area (SLA) were less susceptible to breakage. However, {{a large part of}} the variation at the taxon scale remained unexplained, implying that unmeasured or undefined traits could be used to predict damage caused by ice storms.

40|$|Abstract: Due {{to their}} {{theoretical}} advantages, hip systems combining modular necks and large diameter femoral heads have gradually gained popularity. However, among others, concerns regarding {{changes in the}} load transfer patterns were raised. Recent stress analyses have indeed shown {{that the use of}} modular necks and big femoral heads causes significant changes in the strain distribution along the femur. Our original hypothesis was that these changes may affect early distal migration of a modular stem. We examined the effect of head diameter and neck geometry on migration at two years of follow-up in a case series of 116 patients (125 hips), who have undergone primary Metal-on-Metal total hip arthroplasty with the modular grit-blasted Profemur E stem combined with large-diameter heads (> 36 mm). We found that choice of neck geometry and head diameter has no effect on stem migration. A multivariate regression analysis including the potential confounding variables of the body mass index, bone quality, canal fill and stem positioning revealed only a negative correlation between subsidence and canal fill in midstem area. Statistical analysis, despite its limitations, did not confirm our hypothesis that choice of neck geometry and/or head diameter affects early distal migration of a modular stem.

We have developed a treatment in which we combined the effects of nitric oxide with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory activity by using HCT 1026, a nitric oxide-releasing derivative of flurbiprofen. Here, we report the results of long-term (1 -year) oral treatment with HCT 1026 of two murine models for limb girdle and Duchenne muscular dystrophies (Î±-sarcoglycan-null and mdx mice). In both models, HCT 1026 significantly ameliorated the morphological, biochemical, and functional phenotype {{in the absence of}} secondary effects, efficiently slowing down disease progression. HCT 1026 acted by reducing inflammation, preventing muscle damage, and preserving the number and function of satellite cells. HCT 1026 was significantly more effective than the corticosteroid prednisolone, which was analyzed in parallel. As an additional beneficial effect, HCT 1026 enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of arterially delivered donor stem cells, by increasing 4 -fold their ability to migrate and reconstitute muscle fibers. The therapeutic strategy we propose is not selective for a subset of mutations; it provides ground for immediate clinical experimentation with HCT 1026 alone, which is approved for use in humans; and it sets the stage for combined therapies with donor or autologous, genetically <b>corrected</b> <b>stem</b> cells...|$|R

For these immunodeficiencies corrected cells have a selective advantage in vivo, and low numbers of gene-modified cells are sufficient to provide therapeutic benefit.

Here we expanded <b>corrected</b> <b>stem</b> cells in vivo in a canine model of a severe erythroid disease, pyruvate kinase deficiency. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used a foamy virus (FV) vector expressing the P 140 K mutant of methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMTP 140 K) for in vivo expansion of corrected hematopoietic repopulating cells. FV vectors are attractive gene transfer vectors for hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy since they efficiently transduce repopulating cells and may be safer than more commonly used gammaretroviral vectors. Following transplantation with HSCs transduced ex vivo using a tri-cistronic FV vector that expressed EGFP, R-type pyruvate kinase, and MGMTP 140 K, {{we were able to}} increase marking from approximately 3. 5 % to 33 % in myeloid long-term repopulating cells resulting in a functional cure.

Here we expanded <b>corrected</b> <b>stem</b> cells in vivo in a canine model of a severe erythroid disease, pyruvate kinase deficiency. We used a foamy virus (FV) vector expressing the P 140 K mutant of methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMTP 140 K) for in vivo expansion of corrected hematopoietic repopulating cells. FV vectors are attractive gene transfer vectors for hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy since they efficiently transduce repopulating cells and may be safer than more commonly used gammaretroviral vectors. Following transplantation with HSCs transduced ex vivo using a tri-cistronic FV vector that expressed EGFP, R-type pyruvate kinase, and MGMTP 140 K, {{we were able to}} increase marking from approximately 3. 5 % to 33 % in myeloid long-term repopulating cells resulting in a functional cure. Here we describe in one affected dog a functional cure for a severe erythroid disease using stem cell selection in vivo. In addition to providing a potential cure for patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency, in vivo selection using foamy vectors with MGMTP 140 K has broad potential for several hematopoietic diseases including hemoglobinopathies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method {{with which to}} assist individuals with no background in linguistics to create monolingual dictionaries such as those used by the morphological analysers of many natural language processing applications. The involvement of non-expert users is especially critical for under-resourced languages which either lack or cannot afford the recruitment of a skilled workforce. Adding a word to a morphological dictionary usually requires identifying its stem along with the inflection paradigm {{that can be used}} in order to generate all the word forms of the new entry. Our method works under the assumption that the average speakers of a language can successfully answer the polar question âis x a valid form of the word w to be inserted?â, where x represents tentative alternative (inflected) forms of the new word w. The experiments show that with a small number of polar questions the <b>correct</b> <b>stem</b> and paradigm can be obtained from non-experts with high success rates. We study the impact of different heuristic and probabilistic approaches on the actual number of questions.

40|$|Total hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA) {{has had a}} {{big impact}} on {{the quality of life of}} millions of patients. Primary THA has a very high success rate and implant survival time of more than 30 years have been reported. However, because of the high number of procedures performed, the small percentage of patients requiring a revision surgery still represent a large number of patients. Templating by means of radiography of hip joints with a defectuous implant-bone fixation can be hindered by the presence of cement and/or by reduced bone quality. Selection of the implant should be guided by the altered anatomy of the femur and/or acetabulum. In some cases the commercially available implants do not allow fixation and restoration of the joint mechanics. To adapt the implants to the patientâs anatomy custom production can be envisioned. Custom made stem implants have been used since 1987 in our centre. Adaptations have been made and tests for evaluating implant stability have been evaluated. Also a new technique that has the objective to help the surgeon in determing the <b>correct</b> <b>stem</b> insertion during surgery has shown promissing results. Several changes in design of the acetabular component have progressively improved the cup stability, even in revision surgery. But a small number of patients present with pelvic and acetabular bone defects that cannot be bridged by the standard cup implants. Also custom made acetabular implants are progressively been used and the new production techniques offer promissing perspectives. status: publishe...|$|R
