40|$|Gravitational lensing {{provides}} a unique probe {{of the inner}} 10 – 1000 pc of distant galaxies (z ∼ 0. 2 – 1). Lens theory predicts that every strong lens system should have a faint image {{near the center of}} the lens galaxy, which should be visible in radio lenses but have not been observed. We study these “core” images using models derived from the stellar distributions in nearby early-type galaxies. We find that realistic galaxies predict a remarkably wide range of <b>core</b> <b>images,</b> with lensing magnifications spanning some six orders of magnitude. More concentrated galaxies produce fainter <b>core</b> <b>images,</b> although not with any simple, quantitative, model independent relation. Some real galaxies have diffuse cores and predict bright <b>core</b> <b>images</b> (magnification µcore � 0. 1), but more common are galaxies that predict faint <b>core</b> <b>images</b> (µcore � 0. 001). Thus, stellar mass distributions alone are probably concentrated enough to explain the lack of observed <b>core</b> <b>images,</b> and may require observational sensitivity to improve by an order of magnitude before detections of <b>core</b> <b>images</b> become common. Two-image lenses will tend to have brighter <b>core</b> <b>images</b> than four-image lenses, so they will be the better targets for finding <b>core</b> <b>images</b> and exploiting these tools for studying the central mass distributions of distant galaxies...|$|E
40|$|Drill cores are {{essential}} {{for the study of}} deep-sea sediments and on-land sites because often no suitable outcrop is available or accessible. These cores form the backbone of stratigraphical studies using and combining various dating techniques. Cyclostratigraphy is usually based on fast and inexpensive measurements of physical sediment properties. One indirect but highly valuable proxy for reconstructing the sediment composition and variability is sediment color. However, cracks and other disturbances in sediment cores may dramatically influence the quality of color data retrieved either directly from photospectrometry or derived from core image analysis. Here we present simple but powerful algorithms to extract color data from <b>core</b> <b>images,</b> and focus on routines to exclude cracks from these images. Results are discussed using the example of an ODP core from the Ceara Rise in the Central Atlantic. The crack correction approach presented highly improves the quality of color data and allows the easy incorporation of cracked cores into studies based on <b>core</b> <b>images.</b> This facilitates the quick and inexpensive generation of large color datasets directly from quantified <b>core</b> <b>images,</b> for cyclostratigraphy and other purposes...|$|E

50|$|The DOS-11 {{operating}} system kernel was one file called MONLIB.LCL. The LCL extension was the acronym for LInked <b>Core</b> <b>Image</b> Library (or LICIL).

The digital core scanner used aboard the JOIDES Resolution during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 303 captured ~ 10 pixels per millimeter of core.

In this study we illustrate a fast and simple method to extract <b>core</b> <b>images</b> as depth-scaled digital data. These data can then be manipulated through image enhancement to highlight detail not easily recognized in the original image or cores. Other data such as multisensor track core scans can be eas-ily overlain on the images. We use digital <b>core</b> <b>images</b> to examine core distortion by developing sets of tables for five Expedition 303 sites that precisely map features in the site composite to those same features in individual cores from each hole at that site.

50|$|<b>Core</b> <b>Image</b> abstracts the pixel-level {{manipulation}} process required when {{applying a}} filter to an image, making it simple for applications to implement image transformation capabilities without extensive coding. In a simple implementation, <b>Core</b> <b>Image</b> applies a single Image Filter to the pixel data {{of a given}} source to produce the transformed image. Each Image Filter specifies a single transform or effect, either built into <b>Core</b> <b>Image</b> or loaded from a plugin called an Image Unit. Combined with preset or user-defined input parameters, the filter {{can be applied to}} the original pixel data without modifying it, thereby providing non-destructive image editing.|$|R
50|$|Like Photoshop, <b>Core</b> <b>Image</b> {{can apply}} {{multiple}} filters {{to the same}} image source. Instead of applying a series of filters individually, <b>Core</b> <b>Image</b> assembles a dynamic instruction pipeline so that only one calculation needs {{to be applied to}} the pixel data to achieve a cumulative effect. Applying the pixel operations associated with multiple filters can be achieved simultaneously and without a significant increase in processing time. Regardless of the number of filters, <b>Core</b> <b>Image</b> assembles the code for this instruction pipeline with a just-in-time compiler, which is executed by either the CPU or graphics card's GPU, whichever can perform the calculation faster.|$|R

40|$|A pseudo-outcrop {{visualization}} {{is demonstrated}} for borehole and full-diameter rock <b>core</b> <b>images</b> {{to augment the}} ubiquitous unwrapped cylinder view and thereby to assist non-specialist interpreters. The pseudo-outcrop visualization is equivalent to a nonlinear projection of the image from borehole to earth frame of reference that creates a solid volume sliced longitudinally to reveal two or more faces in which the orientations of geological features indicate what is observed in the subsurface. A proxy for grain size is used to modulate the external dimensions of the plot to mimic profiles seen in real outcrops. The volume is created from a mixture of geological boundary elements and texture, the latter being the residue after the sum of boundary elements is subtracted from the original data. In the case of measurements from wireline microresistivity tools, whose circumferential coverage is substantially less than 100 %, the missing circumferential data is first inpainted using multiscale directional transforms, which decompose the image into its elemental building structures, before reconstructing the full image.
