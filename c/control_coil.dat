50|$|The {{engine was}} {{reworked}} substantially in 2000 {{in order to}} meet increasing emission requirements; with the 2.5 and 3.0 being replaced by lower compression 2.6 and 3.2 units. While displacement was changed the bore centers and deck height were retained. These later power plants had a revised engine management system setup, which utilised quad lambda sensor <b>control,</b> <b>coil</b> per plug ignition system and drive by wire throttles. The 3.2 also received a stronger steel crankshaft. As a result of these changes the EGR and secondary air injection system were removed.|$|E
5000|$|Mercury relays {{consist of}} a {{vertical}} (usually glass) tube containing liquid mercury. They have isolated contacts {{at the bottom of}} the tube and partway up, usually in a side arm of the glass. The relay works by displacement. A pool of mercury fills the lower portion of the tube, but is insufficient to bridge the contacts. A magnetic slug of iron or steel is placed in the tube, where it sinks by gravity so as to displace the mercury. The displaced mercury rises in the tube, sufficiently to bridge the contacts and complete the circuit between them. Around the top part of the tube is placed the coil. When energised, this coil attracts the slug, lifting it upwards and out of the mercury pool. The mercury is no longer displaced, so flows downwards, away from the upper contact and the circuit opens. This allows for normally closed operation. For the more traditional normally open relay operation, the side contact is arranged somewhat higher up (or the volume of mercury is reduced) so that contact is not made when the iron slug is freely floating on the pool of mercury. The <b>control</b> <b>coil</b> is mounted below the rest level of the slug and when energised draws down the slug deeper into the pool displacing additional mercury thus raising the level to the previously uncovered side contact and closing the circuit.|$|E

Carbon-fiber plates are then glued onto the outside of the frame to support the solar panels and attitude <b>control</b> <b>coils.</b> The solar panels and attitude <b>control</b> <b>coils</b> are glued to the plates.|$|R
40|$|A proof-of-feasibility {{demonstration}} {{showed that}} high-T(sub c) superconductor (HTS) coils {{can be used}} in a high-load, active magnetic bearing in LN 2. A homopolar radial bearing with commercially wound HTS (Bi 2223) bias and <b>control</b> <b>coils</b> produced over 890 N (200 lb) radial load capacity (measured non-rotatings) and supported a shaft to 14, 000 rpm. The goal was to show that HTS coils can operate stably with ferromagnetic cores in a feedback controlled system at a current density similar to that for Cu in LN 2. The bias coil, wound with non-twisted, multifilament HTS conductor, dissipated negligible power for its direct current. The <b>control</b> <b>coils,</b> wound with monofilament HTS sheathed in Ag, dissipated negligible power for direct current. AC losses increased rapidly with frequency and quadratically with AC amplitude. Above about 2 Hz, the effective resistance of the <b>control</b> <b>coils</b> exceeds that of the silver which is in electrical parallel with the oxide superconductor. These results show that twisted multifilament conductor is not needed for stable levitation but may be desired to reduce control power for sizable dynamic loads...|$|R
50|$|If {{resistance}} {{to be measured}} is high, no current will flow through the deflecting <b>coil,</b> the <b>controlling</b> <b>coil,</b> will therefore, set itself perpendicular to the magnetic axis and hence set the pointer to the infinity.|$|R
30|$|According to Eq. (18), the {{magnetic}} flux {{of the air}} gap in the x direction produced by the <b>control</b> <b>coil</b> of the y direction is approximately 1 / 20 of {{the magnetic}} flux produced by the <b>control</b> <b>coil</b> of the x direction. Similarly, the magnetic flux of the air gap in the y direction produced by the <b>control</b> <b>coil</b> of the x direction is approximately 1 / 20 of the magnetic flux produced by the <b>control</b> <b>coil</b> of the y direction. Thus, the mutual coupling of magnetic flux in the radial two DOFs (x and y directions) can be ignored.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—ELMs (Edge {{localized}} modes) are oscillations {{of hydrogen}} or deuterium emission {{on the edge}} of plasma in high confinement mode which result in plasma power loss. To suppress these oscillations, ELM control coils are used in tokamak. As per the ELM coil requirement, phase shifted pulsed power supply (PSPPS) is needed to generate RMP (resonant magnetic perturbation) which decreases the magnitude of ELMs. This paper presents a typical small scale high voltage low current design and PSCAD simulation of PSPPS for ELM <b>control</b> <b>coil.</b> Experiment was carried out to practically verify the simulation results. In experiment phase shift is generated by FPGA. This PSPPS control can be used in any large scale application of <b>control</b> <b>coil</b> with proper isolation...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that coating platinum coils with transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) would improve the cellular proliferation within experimental aneurysms relative to uncoated coils. Materials and methods: Elastase-induced saccular aneurysms were created in 12 New Zealand White rabbits. These aneurysms were embolized with platinum coils, either "control" (unmodified) coils or "test" (coated with TGF beta) coils. Subjects were killed either 2 weeks (n = 3, control; n = 3, test) or 6 weeks (n = 3, control; n = 3, test) after embolization. Aneurysm tissue was embedded in plastic, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The thickness of tissue covering the coils at the coil-lumen interface was measured by use of a digital microscope, and was compared between groups by use of the Student's t test (P {{less than or equal}} to 0. 05). Results: Two-week implantation samples demonstrated mean thickness of tissue overlying TGF beta -coated coils of 36 +/- 15 mum and mean thickness of overlying <b>control</b> <b>coils</b> of 3 +/- 5 mum, indicating significantly thicker tissue growth covering test versus <b>control</b> <b>coils</b> (P = 0. 02). Six-week implantation samples demonstrated mean thickness of tissue overlying TGF beta -coated coils of 86 +/- 74 mum versus mean thickness overlying <b>control</b> <b>coils</b> of 37 +/- 6 mu; this difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0. 30). Thickness of tissue covering TGF beta -coated coils did not change significantly from 2 to 6 weeks (P = 0. 31). Tissue thickness over <b>control</b> <b>coils</b> increased significantly between 2 and 6 weeks (P = 0. 002). Conclusion: TGF beta -coated platinum coils undergo earlier cellular coverage than standard platinum coils, but differences in coverage between coated and <b>control</b> <b>coils</b> are no longer present at later time points. These data suggest that improvements in intra-aneurysmal cellular proliferation resulting from coil modifications, although significant in the early postembolization phase, may dissipate over time...|$|R

40|$|Summary: The Trispan {{device is}} a new tool {{designed}} {{for use in the}} endovascular treatment of wide-neck aneurysms with coils. We describe another application of this device to <b>control</b> <b>coil</b> deposition and to prevent coil migration during transvenous occlusion of high-flow arteriovenous fistulas. Endovascular techniques have become the stan-dard approach for the treatment of arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) (1). AVFs can be treated with a va-riety of occlusive devices or products (eg, coils, glue) by arterial or venous approaches. One potential com-plication of the use of embolization techniques in high-flow situations is distal migration of the occlu-sive material. Controlled detachable coils are useful in this context, because they can be repositioned until a stable and safe position is obtained, and thus, they are commonly used as the initial occlusive agents (2). In cases of high-vascular-flow AVFs with no anatomic features to provide intrinsic support (eg, stenosis, vascular loop), coils may not be satisfactorily an-chored, and its migration after its detachment is pos-sible. We describe our initial experience with the Trispan device (Target Therapeutics, Fremont, CA) to <b>control</b> <b>coil</b> deposition and to prevent the distal migration of coils in patients with a high-flow AVF. Four patients, two children (one aged 10 months; the other, 10 years), and two adults (one aged 47 years; the other, 84 years) with intracranial high-flow fistulas (one vein of Galen malformation, three complex or multiple dural fistulas [Table]) were endovascularly treated with the assistance of one or several Trispan devices. In each case, planned treatment included deliberate coil occlusion of the venous outlet of the fistula. Herein we present two of these cases...|$|E

40|$|A unique {{experiment}} in the Joint European Torus (JET) consecutively produced 120 almost identical plasma pulses, providing two orders of magnitude more data than is usually available. This allows the statistical detection of previously unobservable phenomena such as a sequence of resonant-like waiting times between edge-localised instabilities (ELMs). Here we investigate the causes of this phenomenon. By synchronising data to the 1000 s of ELM times and averaging the results, random errors are reduced {{by a factor of}} 50, allowing unprecedentedly detailed behaviour to be described. A clear link can then be observed between plasma confinement, ELM occurrence, vertical plasma oscillations, and an otherwise unobservable oscillation in a <b>control</b> <b>coil</b> current that is not usually associated with ELM occurrence.
