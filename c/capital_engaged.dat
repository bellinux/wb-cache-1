60|$|There is, in short, a {{productive}} class, and there is, besides, a class technically styled the monied class, who live upon {{the interest of}} their <b>capital,</b> without <b>engaging</b> personally {{in the work of}} production.|$|R
60|$|Of the <b>capital</b> <b>engaged</b> in the {{production}} of any commodity, there is a part which, after being once used, exists no longer as capital; is no longer capable of rendering service to production, or at least not the same service, nor to the same sort of production. Such, for example, is the portion of capital which consists of materials. The tallow and alkali of which soap is made, once used in the manufacture, are destroyed as alkali and tallow. In the same division must be placed the portion of capital which is paid as the wages, or consumed as the subsistence, of laborers. That part of the capital of a cotton-spinner which he pays away to his work-people, once so paid, exists no longer as his capital, or as a cotton-spinner’s capital. Capital which in this manner fulfills the whole of its office in {{the production}} in which it is engaged, by a single use, is called Circulating Capital. The term, which is not very appropriate, is derived from the circumstance that this portion of capital requires to be constantly renewed by the sale of the finished product, and when renewed is perpetually parted with in buying materials and paying wages; so that it does its work, not by being kept, but by changing hands.|$|E
60|$|There is {{at every}} {{time and place}} some {{particular}} rate of profit which is the lowest that will induce the people of that country and time to accumulate savings, and to employ those savings productively. This minimum rate of profit varies according to circumstances. It depends on two elements: One is {{the strength of the}} effective desire of accumulation; the comparative estimate, made by the people of that place and era, of future interests when weighed against present. This element chiefly affects the inclination to save. The other element, which affects not so much the willingness to save as the disposition to employ savings productively, is the degree of security of <b>capital</b> <b>engaged</b> in industrial operations. In employing any funds which a person may possess as capital on his own account, or in lending it to others to be so employed, there is always some additional risk over and above that incurred by keeping it idle in his own custody. This extra risk is great in proportion as the general state of society is insecure: it may be equivalent to twenty, thirty, or fifty per cent, or to no more than one or two; something however, it must always be; and for this the expectation of profit must be sufficient to compensate.|$|E
6000|$|But in {{all this}} {{it must be noted}} that this price must include the [...] return to capital also, and that it must be equal to the usual [...] reward for capital in other {{competing}} industries, that is, the [...] ordinary rate of profit. In exporting wheat from the United States [...] the <b>capital</b> <b>engaged</b> will insist on getting the rate of profit to [...] be found in other occupations to which the capital can go, in the [...] United States. Now, the price, if it stands for the value (which [...] is supposed to be governed by cost of production in this case), is [...] the sum out of which wages and profits are paid. If the price were [...] to fall in the foreign market, then there might not be the means [...] with which to pay the usual rate of wages and the usual rate of [...] profit also. Then we should probably hear of complaints by the [...] shippers that there is no profit in the exportation of wheat, and [...] of a falling off in the trade. In other words, as the capitalist [...] is the one who manages the operation, and is the one first [...] affected, the diminution of advantage in foreign trade arising [...] from competition, generally shows itself first in lessened [...] profits. The price, then, is the means by which we determine [...] whether a certain article gives us that comparative advantage [...] which will insure a gain from international trade.|$|E

60|$|In {{countries}} like North America and the Australian colonies, where {{the knowledge and}} arts of civilized life and a high effective desire of accumulation coexist with a boundless extent of unoccupied land, the growth of capital easily keeps pace with the utmost possible increase of population, and is chiefly retarded by the impracticability of obtaining laborers enough. All, therefore, who can possibly be born can find employment without overstocking the market: every laboring family enjoys in abundance the necessaries, many of the comforts, {{and some of the}} luxuries of life; and, unless in case of individual misconduct, or actual inability to work, poverty does not, and dependence need not, exist. [In England] so gigantic has been the progress of the cotton manufacture since the inventions of Watt and Arkwright, that the <b>capital</b> <b>engaged</b> in it has probably quadrupled in the time which population requires for doubling. While, therefore, it has attracted from other employments nearly all the hands which geographical circumstances and the habits or inclinations of the people rendered available; and while the demand it created for infant labor has enlisted the immediate pecuniary interest of the operatives in favor of promoting, instead of restraining, the increase of population; nevertheless wages in the great seats of the manufacture are still so high that the collective earnings of a family amount, on an average of years, to a very satisfactory sum; and there is as yet no sign of decrease, while the effect has also been felt in raising the general standard of agricultural wages in the counties adjoining.|$|E
6000|$|Of the {{industries}} {{in a country}} some are said to “need protection” [...] and others not—that is, those industries which are carried on at a [...] relative disadvantage {{are the only ones}} which need protection in [...] order that they may continue in operation.

After duties are thus supposed to have protected the [...] less advantageously situated occupations, it may be said that all [...] industries will then have an equal chance. “No doubt,” as Mr. [...] Cairnes says, “they would be equalized just as by compelling every [...] one to move about with a weight attached to his leg.

60|$|The {{objection}} to a graduated property-tax applies in an aggravated degree to the proposition of an exclusive tax {{on what is}} called “realized property,” that is, property not forming a part of any <b>capital</b> <b>engaged</b> in business, or rather in business under the superintendence of the owner; as land, the public funds, money lent on mortgage, and shares in stock companies. Except the proposal of applying a sponge to the national debt, no such palpable violation of common honesty has found sufficient support in this country, during the present generation, {{to be regarded as}} within the domain of discussion. It has not the palliation of a graduated property-tax, that of laying the burden on those best able to bear it; for “realized property” includes the far larger portion of the provision made for those who are unable to work, and consists, in great part, of extremely small fractions. I can hardly conceive a more shameless pretension than that the major part of the property of the country, that of merchants, manufacturers, farmers, and shopkeepers, should be exempted from its share of taxation; that these classes should only begin to pay their proportion after retiring from business, and if they never retire should be excused from it altogether. But even this does not give an adequate idea of the injustice of the proposition. The burden thus exclusively thrown on the owners of the smaller portion of the wealth of the community would not even be a burden on that class of persons in perpetual succession, but would fall exclusively on those who happened to compose it when the tax was laid on. As land and those particular securities would thenceforth yield a smaller net income, relatively to the general interest of capital and to the profits of trade, the balance would rectify itself by a permanent depreciation of those kinds of property. Future buyers would acquire land and securities at a reduction of price, equivalent to the peculiar tax, which tax they would, therefore, escape from paying; while the original possessors would remain burdened with it even after parting with the property, since they would have sold their land or securities at a loss of value equivalent to the fee-simple of the tax. Its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax.|$|E

5000|$|Already in {{the early}} 1940s Gambra assumed {{teaching}} at the Madrid Academia Vazquez de Mella, a semi-official Carlist educational and cultural enterprise; he was giving lectures on Traditionalist theory of philosophy, state and politics. In 1943 he moved to Pamplona, where he was employed by Instituto Príncipe de Viana, a cultural outpost of Carlism managed by the provincial authorities. During the next 12 years Gambra served in the Institute as professor of philosophy, {{in the early}} 1950s apparently hoping to join a would-be Universidad del País Vasco-Navarro, a high-education establishment advocated at the time. However, when Universidad de Navarra materialized as a private Opus Dei enterprise in 1952, Gambra did not enlist; he rejected also an opportunity to pursue research and possibly scholarship in England. In the mid-1950s {{he returned to the}} <b>capital,</b> <b>engaged</b> in governmental attempt to re-shape the secondary education structures. He assumed teaching in newly created [...] "centros modelos de segunda ensañanza", first in Instituto Miguel de Cervantes and in the mid-1960s moving to Instituto Nacional de Enseñanza Media Lope de Vega, becoming its vicedirector later on. As education official he was anxious to prevent [...] "erosión de la espiritualidad", and in the early 1960s he opposed technocratic changes, proposed and eventually introduced in education. He co-operated also with Universidad Complutense, particularly with the associated San Pablo CEU college, run by ACdP. Gambra continued collaborating with CEU from the mid-1960s to 1994, also after San Pablo had formally separated from Complutense and became an independent university. Apart from professional engagements, Gambra continued his teaching career also with a number of semi-scholarly institutions. Until the early 1960s Gambra was giving lectures at Ateneo de Madrid, at that time led by Florentino Pérez Embid, and Instituto de Cultura Hispánica, an establishment created by Francoist authorities to cultivate the Latin American link. In the press referred to as [...] "catedrático", he was active in once-off conferences, also beyond Madrid, and in periodical Catholic cultural-scientific initiatives, like Conversaciones Intelectuales de El Paular or sessions organized by Hermandad Sacerdotal. In the mid-1960s he commenced engagement in Madrid-based Centro de Estudios Históricos y Políticos General Zumalacárregui, a think-tank set up to disseminate Traditionalist thought and counter progressist designs on Carlism. In the late 1960s he stood as a recognized authority, at least within the Traditionalist realm. He continued giving lectures in the 1980s, as late as 1989 and 1992.

Subsequently, the involvement of HEIs in London in knowledge-based venturing processes is significantly lower than that expected.
