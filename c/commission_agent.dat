The contracts between the distant millers and their <b>commission</b> <b>agents</b> help to explain the specific form that collusion takes. Simulations indicate that (i) the cartel gains considerably by colluding, over the competitive outcome; (ii) however, sellers (farmers) do not lose significantly under collusion when the <b>commission</b> <b>agents</b> bid. The paper also shows that efficient collusion, the form of collusion commonly assumed in the literature, does not explain the data well. ...|$|R

2500|$|After Kelly and Schroeder {{had moved}} in, two other well-to-do men of German {{extraction}} made country retreats {{for themselves in}} Woodside. They were Gustav Sussdorf and Louis Windmuller. [...] Like Kelly and Schroeder, Sussdorf was a Charleston merchant. [...] In 1859 he sold his fancy goods business and moved to New York. Not long after, he bought a farm owned by the family of Thomas Cumberson {{who had died in}} 1849. It is quite possible that he learned of the place through acquaintance with Schroeder or, more likely, Kelly. [...] Windmuller was of a younger generation than Kelly, Schroeder, and Sussdorf. [...] He emigrated to New York {{in the aftermath of the}} Revolutions of 1848. [...] Only 18 years old and penniless, he found success as a <b>commission</b> <b>agent,</b> bringing goods to clients in the U.S. from Germany and other European countries. In 1867 he had accumulated enough savings to buy property adjoining Sussdorf's. The land had formerly belonged to the Morrell family, but had been acquired by a speculator, Antonie J.D. Mecke, and became available to Windmuller on Mecke's going bankrupt.|$|E
2500|$|Carter Braxton {{was born}} on Newington Plantation in King and Queen County, Virginia on September 10, 1736, but wrongly {{reported}} as dead along with his mother, Mary Carter Braxton, who [...] "unhappily catching Cold," [...] died shortly after his birth. His maternal grandfather, King Carter, possibly the wealthiest man {{as well as the}} largest landowner in Virginia {{at the time of his}} death, had bequeathed ₤2,000 to his youngest daughter, who became bethrothed to George Braxon Jr. five months after her father's death (although her brother had not paid that full amount to her new husband by the time of her death). His paternal grandfather, George Braxton, Sr. by 1704 (before western lands were opened to European settlement) had also become one of the 100 largest landowners in Virginia's Northern Neck. George Braxton Sr. had been elected for the first time to the House of Burgesses in 1718, and was reelected nine years later with John Robinson, Jr., who would become the powerful Speaker of the House of Burgesses and benefactor of the Braxton family. The elder Braxton owned at least one ship, the 'Braxton' that traded with the West Indies and elsewhere, and was <b>commission</b> <b>agent</b> for cargoes of enslaved blacks sold to Virginia planters. He died, aged 71, when Carter was twelve; his eldest son (Carter's father) George Jr. had succeeded him as delegate for King and Queen County in 1742, but himself died not long thereafter (in 1749). Speaker Robinson and neighbor Humphrey Hill served as guardians for Carter and his slightly (3 year) elder brother George (who inherited Newington and various land in King and Queen and Essex County).|$|E

30|$|Contractors are {{important}} parts of the date marketing chain in Pakistan. They perform early yield estimates of palm groves and costs for labour, storage, transportation, and processing of dates (Khushk et al. 2009). Often contracts for date palm grove were made as early as at the pollination stage. This again was similar to data reported by RUAF (2014) for value chain of dates in Gaza. In our study contractors payed (5  %) more to date palm growers for their produce compared with <b>commission</b> <b>agents.</b> Some contractors also took loans from commission agents; they either sold dates through them or payed back loans and interest after marketing their produce. Aujla et al. (2007) noted that 70 – 90  % of the fruit growers in Pakistan sold their harvesting rights at the flowering stage to contractors, while more than 97  % of the fruit contractors took loans from <b>commission</b> <b>agents</b> to pay the contract money to fruit orchard owners and labourers working in the groves. This underlines the dependency of contractors on <b>commission</b> <b>agents</b> for credit in the study area.|$|R

Moreover, he begged and implored her to accept that affection, to accept it now that it might belong to her forever. Happiness, he said, seemed opening before her; he implored her {{to allow him to}} share that happiness with her. The rest of the letter was read most jubilantly aloud. It told of news which had come to Newcombe from Honduras Gulf: great news, wonderful news, which would make the heart sing. Major Bonnet was at Belize. He had given up all connection with piracy and was now engaged in mercantile pursuits.

40|$|In Turkey, the Wholesale Markets Law {{was enacted}} in 1995 to {{facilitate}} small-scale growers' {{access to the}} fresh produce market. Cooperatives and <b>commission</b> <b>agents</b> have thus become the main marketing structures available to small-scale fresh produce growers, to supply supermarkets and comply with their new requirements. In this paper, we question {{the advantages and disadvantages}} that confront small farmers with respect to those marketing structures to allow for market matching or quality upgrading. Drawing on ownership and transaction cost arguments, we use an analytical framework to identify and compare the costs of these marketing organizations. Based on data collected through a large number of interviews with stakeholders, we show that <b>commission</b> <b>agents</b> and credit cooperatives tend to be more efficient than traditional cooperatives as regards sales performance and decision costs. However, the lack of apparent competition between <b>commission</b> <b>agents</b> does not allow for sufficient provision of incentives for producers to invest in high-quality production. Consequently, credit cooperatives are the only structure progressively turning to strategies of quality upgrading and supermarket supply. The flipside of such strategies is that they may lead to the marginalization of smallscale farmers. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
