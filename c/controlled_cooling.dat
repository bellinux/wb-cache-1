40|$|Abstract. Cold {{cracking}} {{phenomenon is}} a very significant problem on welding of steel. This phenomenon usually occurs after welding process finishes in more than 24 hours. Crack often {{takes place in the}} heat affected zone area. Generally, cold cracking is due to hydrogen diffusion during welding process, residual stress and susceptible microstructure at low temperature (below 150 o C). Welding process on thick plate high strength low alloy (HSLA) steel gives a high risk to cold cracking phenomenon. The cooling rate of thick plate during welding may increase the absorbtion of heat compared to thin plate. <b>Controlling</b> <b>cooling</b> rate is the main factor on welding of thick HSLA steel plate. A single v-butt joint on HSLA and S 45 C by using Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) has been investigated. This investigation was carried out on a 40 mm thick HSLA steel by <b>controlling</b> <b>cooling</b> rate and by using cooling media such as air, blanket and electric heater. The result shows that prevention of cold cracking can be made by <b>controlling</b> <b>cooling</b> time at low temperature (T 300 - T 100) {{in order to keep the}} cooling time larger than the critical cooling time. The use of cooling media with electric heater can prevent the cold cracking at HSLA weldment. Crack can be found on the weldment due to the presence of stress concentration, local variation of hardness and microstructure, which may result in brittle fracture of the crack surface...|$|R
2500|$|The XJ12 {{version was}} {{announced}} in July 1972, featuring simplified grille treatment, and powered by a 5.3L V12 engine (coupled to a Borg Warner Model 12). The car as presented {{at that time was}} the world's only mass-produced 12-cylinder four-door car, and, with a top speed [...] "around 140 mph" [...] (225km/h) as the [...] "fastest full four-seater available in the world today". Although it had been the manufacturer's intention from launch that the XJ would take the twelve-cylinder engine, its installation was nonetheless a tight fit, and providing adequate cooling had evidently been a challenge for the engineers designing the installation. [...] Bonnet/hood louvres such as those fitted on the recently introduced twelve-cylinder E Type were rejected, but the XJ12 featured a complex [...] "cross-flow" [...] radiator divided into two separated horizontal sections and supported with coolant feeder tanks at each end: [...] the engine fan was geared to rotate at 1¼ times the speed of the engine rpm, subject to a limiter which cut in at a (fan) speed of 1,700rpm. [...] The fuel system incorporated a relief valve that returned fuel to the tank when pressure in the leads to the carburetters exceeded 1.5 psi {{to reduce the risk of}} vapour locks occurring at the engine's high operating temperature, while the car's battery, unusually, benefited from its own thermostatically <b>controlled</b> <b>cooling</b> fan.|$|E

Cryoprotectant toxicity, chilling sensitivity and embryo membrane permeability were investigated {{with a view to}} developing optimum protocols for cryopreservation of the embryos using <b>controlled</b> slow <b>cooling,</b> non-freezing storage and vitrification. Methanol was found to be the most effective cryoprotectant for <b>controlled</b> slow <b>cooling</b> and non-freezing storage of zebrafish embryos with 11 %heart beat stage embryos surviving after <b>controlled</b> slow <b>cooling</b> to - 25 °C. Zebrafish embryos were found to be very chilling sensitive with early developmental stages being the most sensitive to chilling injury. Embryo developmental stages after closure of the blastopore (> 12 -h), especially post heart beat stages were much more resistant to cryoprotectant toxicity and chilling injury. Heart beat stage (27 -h) embryos proved to be the best embryo developmental stage for <b>controlled</b> slow <b>cooling</b> and non-freezing storage. Dechorionated embryos are more sensitive to cryoprotectant toxicity and chilling injury. The sensitivity to chilling injury of zebrafish embryos limited the use of <b>controlled</b> slow <b>cooling</b> and non-freezing storage for long term cryopreservation. The attempts at cryopreservation of zebrafish embryos using vitrification produced no embryo survival, although up to 32 % embryos remained morphologically intact immediately after vitrification. Poor cryoprotectant permeation, dehydration and consequently ice formation within the egg are probably the main factors on effecting embryo survival. The results of zebrafish embryo permeability studies demonstrated that the chorion of the embryos was permeable to water and cryoprotectants, whilst the vitelline (plasma) membrane was an effective permeability barrier. The inability to achieve sufficient penetration of the vitelline membrane by cryoprotectants poses severe problems for long term cryopreservation, which need to be overcome, possibly by permeabilisation of the vitelline membrane, before successful cryopreservation can be achieve...|$|R

It is observed that significant energy savings can be obtained when compared with random sensor deployment.|$|R
