40|$|The {{onion is}} a widely {{distributed}} vegetable crop, which takes an important place in the vegetable production in Serbia. The traditional planting method is the one from sets. Old cultivars and populations and, in recent years, foreign cultivars are grown. The large variety of genotypes, including both domestic populations and cultivars, comprises the significant gene pool of this region. The onion collection of the Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops in Novi Sad {{is based on the}} populations and cultivars from the territory of the former Yugoslavia. This paper reviews 30 onion genotypes on the basic IPGRI descriptors (ANNEX I). Variability of the reviewed characteristics was determined by PC analysis.

The {{morphological}} and agronomical {{diversity of}} sixteen onion ecotypes collected in Niger {{were analyzed using}} the descriptors established by Bioversity International. The experimentation was conducted in Madaoua and Saga-Gorou localities, according to a randomized complete block design with four repetitions. The Hierarchical Ascendant Classification (HAC) and Factorial Discriminant Analysis (FDA) on nine quantitative traits point out a structuration of this diversity in three groups based on leaves length and diameter, and on bulbs weight. The Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) based on qualitative morphological characters showed that Niger onion ecotypes are structured into five groups. The most distinctive qualitative variables between ecotypes are leaf <b>color,</b> <b>bulb</b> shape and <b>color,</b> uniformity of <b>bulb</b> shape and <b>color.</b> No correlation is found between the groups obtained from qualitative characters and the groups obtained from quantitative traits.

2500|$|Most {{light bulbs}} have either clear or coated glass. The coated glass bulbs have a white powdery {{substance}} {{on the inside}} called kaolin. Kaolin, or kaolinite, is a white, chalky clay in a very fine powder form, that is blown in and electrostatically deposited on {{the interior of the}} bulb. It diffuses the light emitted from the filament, producing a more gentle and evenly distributed light. Manufacturers may add pigments to the kaolin to adjust the characteristics of the final light emitted from the bulb. Kaolin diffused bulbs are used extensively in interior lighting because of their comparatively gentle light. Other kinds of <b>colored</b> <b>bulbs</b> are also made, including the various colors used for [...] "party bulbs", Christmas tree lights and other decorative lighting. These are created by coloring the glass with a dopant; which is often a metal like cobalt (blue) or chromium (green).

Major characters included in the principal components were bulb weight, diameter, yield, number of cloves per bulb, maturity, plant height, number of green leaves at 135 days after planting, and bulbing period.

Three complementary approaches were applied to identify and characterize Niger local onion varieties and ecotypes. These have permitted the classification of the existing local diversity according (i) a nomenclature employed by the farmers, (ii) their morphology based on Biodiversity International scientific descriptors, and (iii) their genotype through the use of microsatellite markers. Interviews conducted with producers have permitted to inventory fifty two local names. But after analysis and grouping by synonyms, it was found that seventeen ecotypes were produced in Niger. The main criteria for a local ecotype naming are the color of the onion bulb and the production area. The most distinctive quantitative and qualitative variables between ecotypes are leaves length and diameter, <b>bulbs</b> weight, leaves <b>color,</b> <b>bulbs</b> shapes and <b>colors,</b> the uniformity of <b>bulbs</b> shapes and <b>colors.</b> The genetic distance was larger, on one hand, between the most geographically distant ecotypes and, on the other hand, between the most different ecotypes in terms of morphological characters.

The accessions exhibited good variation for qualitative traits like early seedling vigour, leaf cross section, leaf arrangement, stem shape, bulb shape, <b>bulb</b> skin <b>color,</b> <b>bulb</b> size, bulb hearting and bulb flesh colour and quantitative traits like plant height, number of leaves per plant, leaf length, leaf girth, number of scales per bulb, total soluble solids (TSS) (°Brix), bulb weight and bulb yield per plant. Correlation study revealed that high significant positive correlation was recorded between number of scales per bulb and bulb weight (r= 0. 71) and significant negative correlation was observed between leaf length and leaf girth (r= - 0. 88), leaf length and bolting (- 0. 63) among others. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the first four principal components explained 99. 76 % of the total variation among the 23 accessions and three controls. PCA I accounted for 97. 04 % of variation, had maximum influence on bulb weight followed by plant height. The PCA II traits were leaf length and plant height which accounted for 1. 97 % of the variance. The PCA III and PCA IV have contributed for 0. 39 and 0. 39 % of total variance.
