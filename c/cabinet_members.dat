5|$|The McMahon {{government}} had consisted of 27ministers, twelve of whom comprised the Cabinet. In {{the run-up to}} the election, the Labor caucus had decided that should the party take power, all 27ministers were to be <b>Cabinet</b> <b>members.</b> Intense canvassing took place amongst ALP parliamentarians as the duumvirate did its work, and on 18 December the caucus elected the Cabinet. The results were generally acceptable to Whitlam, and within three hours, he had announced the portfolios of the <b>Cabinet</b> <b>members.</b> To give himself greater control over the Cabinet, in January 1973 Whitlam established five Cabinet committees (with the members appointed by himself, not the caucus) and took full control of the Cabinet agenda.|$|E

5|$|Butler, by contrast, {{was seen}} as on the liberal wing of the Conservatives, and his {{election}} as leader might split the party.

In April 1865, Beauregard and his commander, General Joseph E. Johnston, convinced Davis {{and the remaining}} <b>cabinet</b> <b>members</b> that the war needed to end. Johnston surrendered {{most of the remaining}} armies of the Confederacy, including Beauregard and his men, to Major General William Tecumseh Sherman.

5|$|However, between 28 April-2 May, the Ba'athist-dominated Military Committee {{virtually}} renounced {{the agreement}} when it purged over 50 Nasserist officers from their high-ranking {{positions in the}} armed forces, leading to a wide-scale propaganda campaign by Egypt via radio denouncing the Ba'ath (Nasserist-leaning newspapers had been previously shut down.) Mass pro-union rioting in Aleppo, Damascus, Hama {{and other parts of}} the country followed. The purges prompted the protest resignations of Nasserist officials, including Defense Minister al-Sufi, Deputy Chief of Staff al-Qutayni, and four other Nasserist <b>cabinet</b> <b>members.</b>|$|E

5|$|Since the Confederacy was founded, {{among other}} things, on states' rights, one {{important}} factor in Davis's choice of <b>cabinet</b> <b>members</b> was representation from the various states. He depended partly upon recommendations from congressmen and other prominent people. This helped maintain good relations between the executive and legislative branches. This also led to complaints as more states joined the Confederacy, however, because there were more states than cabinet positions.|$|E

5|$|With the {{pressure}} on the Diệm regime increasing during the Buddhist crisis, Nhu and Diệm began to shun their <b>cabinet</b> <b>members</b> because they presented arguments contrary to the thinking of the Ngô family. Many ministers attempted to resign, but Thơ was credited with persuading them to stay in office. Finding the situation increasingly intolerable, Thơ also considered resigning but the dissident generals urged him to remain. They were worried that mass resignations would arouse suspicion of a coup plot.|$|E
