It {{receives}} {{a grant from the}} its local state government to support a new special education initiative, another grant from the federal government for a school lunch program, and an annuity to award teachers working on research projects. At periodic intervals, the school system needs to generate a report to the state about the special education program, a report to a federal agency about the school lunch program, and a report to another authority about the research program. Each of these programs has its own unique reporting requirements, so the school system needs a method to separately identify the related revenues and expenditures. This is done by establishing separate funds, each with its own <b>chart</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Charts</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> {{have played}} {{a vital role in}} the {{development}} of accountancy in Poland since the Second World War. In the period of the centrally-run economy the <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> enterprises was based on uniform requirements. They included, among other things, the obligation to conduct accounting according to uniform or standard <b>charts</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts,</b> which were frequently changed or modified temporarily. The radical political and economic transition in Poland after 1990 brought about changes to legal rules regulating accountancy. The changes aimed to reduce their number and complexity. Under the new legislation, business entities (apart from those in the budgetary sector and banks) develop individually their own plans <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> which are best suited to financial reporting and management accounting purposes.

40|$|The International Federation of Accountants {{recommends}} a transition <b>of</b> all <b>accounting</b> {{units in the}} public sector to the accrual basis and issues International Public Sector Accounting Standards to support the new concept. Accounting in the Czech public administration is based rather on the cash base with all its drawbacks and complications Regional administration units are finding out and recording net cash flow directly in the system <b>of</b> synthetic <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> the core activitity in the ledger, with the priority of recording income and expenses. Organizational parts of the state use the same system of bookkeeping based on the same directive <b>charts</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts.</b> I percieve a conceptual inconsistence in {{the fact that in the}} system <b>of</b> synthetic <b>accounts,</b> the budget surplus or deficit as the main expression <b>of</b> the <b>accounting</b> cash concept is not being found out neither recorded. An obstacle for implementing the accrual principle lies also in the persistent definition of yields. For the area of budget economy <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> units <b>of</b> public administration, existence of yields is not admitted. The reason is to be found in business concept of yields expecting yields only in rela- tion to the market. This concept will have to be substituted by a concept which respects so called non-exchangeable yields. Then, based on this concept, yield accounts will be incorporated into the <b>charts</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> the core activity <b>of</b> the <b>accounting</b> units. Accrual accounting concept, which is also based on the comparison of costs with performance for which they are expended, creates prerequisites also for depreciation of long-term assets. In the current concept <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> core activity <b>of</b> public administration these long-term assets are not depreciated. Its appreciation and reporting then intentionally does not respect the requirement of true picture of reality. Therefore the content and methodology of changes have to be considered, especially in the following fields: • Acknowledgement and introduction of the category of income as defined by IPSAS; • Restructuring <b>of</b> the pilot <b>accounting</b> system according to the accrual concept; • Detecting budget inflows or outflows outside the system <b>of</b> the synthetic <b>accounts</b> based on the analytical accounts (budget classification); • Restructuring <b>of</b> the <b>accounting</b> statement scheme, namely its internal structure; • Creating legislative conditions to change the system...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} categorisation of expenditures {{evident in}} many firms’ <b>charts</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> and financial statements does not identify and measure expenditures on intangible investment separately from tangible investment and operating expenditures.

Further, in searching for better ways to account for intangibles, regulators and researchers {{have focused on the}} accounting choice problem relating to the existence and recognisability of intangible assets. In this paper, we argue that identifying and separately reporting the expenditures on intangible investment is the logical first step in accounting for intangible investments.
