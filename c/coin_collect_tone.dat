2500|$|During the 17th and 18th centuries <b>coin</b> <b>collecting</b> {{remained}} a {{pursuit of the}} well-to-do. But rational, Enlightenment thinking led to a more systematic approach to accumulation and study. [...] Numismatics as an academic discipline emerged in these centuries {{at the same time}} as <b>coin</b> <b>collecting</b> became a leisure pursuit of a growing middle class, eager to prove their wealth and sophistication. During the 19th and 20th centuries, <b>coin</b> <b>collecting</b> increased further in popularity. [...] The market for coins expanded to include not only antique coins, but foreign or otherwise exotic currency. Coin shows, trade associations, and regulatory bodies emerged during these decades. The first international convention for coin collectors was held [...] 1518 August 1962, in Detroit, Michigan, and was sponsored by the American Numismatic Association and the Royal Canadian Numismatic Association. Attendance was estimated at 40,000. As one of the oldest and most popular world pastimes, <b>coin</b> <b>collecting</b> is now often referred to as the [...] "King of Hobbies".|$|R

50|$|In 1938, Whitman began {{publishing}} coin boards, used by coin collectors {{to store}} their collections. In 1942, the company published its first price guide, The Official Blue Book of U.S. Coins. This started an expanding line of books aimed at numismatists {{which would include}} hundreds of titles. The line continued as Western was sold to Mattel in 1982, then spun off and renamed Golden Books Family Entertainment. The new company sold off Whitman Coin Products and other non-kids lines to St. Martin's Press. They in turn sold off just the Whitman Coin Products line to the H.E. Harris company, another publisher specializing in <b>coin</b> <b>collecting</b> materials. H.E. Harris was then renamed Whitman Publishing, and continues to produce primarily <b>coin</b> <b>collecting</b> materials. As of 2017, Whitman was also publishing books on other topics, {{in addition to the}} <b>coin</b> <b>collecting</b> materials and books.|$|R
