25|$|Etisalat {{operates}} an Internet <b>content</b> <b>filtering</b> {{system that}} blocks access to web resources. The web resources are {{claimed to be}} controversial or offensive (i.e. sexually explicit content, certain political and religious websites, anonymizers and proxies) or harmful (i.e. numeric IP addresses, known phishing or malicious websites, botnet command servers). The use of <b>content</b> <b>filtering</b> is mandated by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) of the United Arab Emirates.|$|E
25|$|There are {{claims that}} Etisalat breaks {{the rules of}} net {{neutrality}} by throttling peer-to-peer, gaming {{and other types of}} network traffic {{in order to reduce the}} load on its oversubscribed international links. The effect of this interference is most noticeable during weekends or periods of high network use. The overall efficiency of the country-wide <b>content</b> <b>filtering</b> is unclear, as many of the technologically savvy users have discovered tools and methods to bypass the content filter, such as using Tor.|$|E
25|$|Unmoderated newsgroups {{form the}} {{majority}} of Usenet newsgroups, and messages submitted by readers for unmoderated newsgroups are immediately propagated for everyone to see. Minimal editorial <b>content</b> <b>filtering</b> vs propagation speed form one crux of the Usenet community. One little cited defense of propagation is canceling a propagated message, but few Usenet users use this command and some news readers do not offer cancellation commands, in part because article storage expires in relatively short order anyway. Almost all unmoderated Usenet groups have become collections of spam.|$|E

25|$|Besides <b>content</b> <b>filtering,</b> other {{imperfect}} {{methods for}} cross-site scripting mitigation are also commonly used. One {{example is the}} use of additional security controls when handling cookie-based user authentication. Many web applications rely on session cookies for authentication between individual HTTP requests, and because client-side scripts generally have access to these cookies, simple XSS exploits can steal these cookies. To mitigate this particular threat (though not the XSS problem in general), many web applications tie session cookies to the IP address of the user who originally logged in, then only permit that IP to use that cookie. This is effective in most situations (if an attacker is only after the cookie), but obviously breaks down in situations where an attacker is behind the same NATed IP address or web proxy as the victim, or the victim is changing his or her mobile IP.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{the company}} started adding IT {{security}} features. By early 2002, CacheFlow {{was on the}} fifth version of its operating system. The Security Gateway 600/6000 Series was the company's newest product family. It had a range of security features, such as authentication, internet use policies, virus scanning, <b>content</b> <b>filtering,</b> and bandwidth restrictions for streaming video applications. Network Computing tested a beta appliance {{and gave it a}} positive review. Later that year, the company was renamed to Blue Coat Systems to focus on security appliances and simultaneously released the SG800. The appliance sat behind corporate firewalls to filter website traffic for viruses, malware, worms and other harmful software. It had a custom operating system called Security Gateway and provided many of its security features through partners, like Symantec and Trend Micro. An InfoWorld review gave it an 8.4 out of 10.|$|E
2500|$|Work in 2008 has {{increased}} NMCI's {{ability to respond}} to security issues and the program was the first network to implement fully the Department of Defense information assurance standards in both classified and unclassified environments. Among the enhancements were the deployment of Websense <b>content</b> <b>filtering,</b> an information assurance tool designed to inspect and block inbound Web traffic containing malicious code with little impact to the user. According to NMCI public affairs, [...] "Websense allows the Network Operational Commands to set a tailored blocking policy by content such as gambling, hate speech or adult content, rather than blocking specific sites or URLs only. This allows the network operators to block sites much more efficiently and outsources the fight against the growing amount of inappropriate content." ...|$|E

This paper looks at how citizens internet viewing can be controlled using <b>content</b> <b>filters</b> to prevent access to illegal sites and malicious contents in Nigeria. Primary data were obtained by administering 100 questionnaires. The data was analyzed by a software package called Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The result of the study shows that 66. 4 % of the respondents agreed that the internet is been abused and the abuse can be controlled by the use of <b>content</b> <b>filters.</b> The PHP, MySQL and Apache were used to design a <b>content</b> <b>filter</b> program. It was recommended that a lot still need to be done by public organizations, academic institutions, government and its agencies especially the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) in Nigeria to control the internet abuse by the under aged and criminals.

2500|$|The Android Market was {{announced}} by Google on August 28, 2008, and was {{made available to}} users on October 22. In December 2010, <b>content</b> <b>filtering</b> {{was added to the}} Android Market, each app's details page started showing a promotional graphic at the top, and the maximum size of an app was raised from 25megabytes to 50megabytes. The Google eBookstore was launched on December 6, 2010, debuting with three million ebooks, making it [...] "the largest ebooks collection in the world". In November 2011, Google announced Google Music, a section of the Play Store offering music purchases. In March 2012, Google increased the maximum allowed size of an app by allowing developers to attach two expansion files to an app's basic download; each expansion file with a maximum size of 2gigabytes, giving app developers a total of 4gigabytes. Also in March, the Android Market was re-branded as Google Play.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2007, Flickr added new <b>content</b> <b>filtering</b> {{controls}} that let members specify by default {{what types of}} images they generally upload (photo, art/illustration, or screenshot) and how [...] "safe" [...] (i.e., unlikely to offend others) their images are, as well as specify that information for specific images individually. Individual images are {{assigned to one of}} three categories: [...] "safe", [...] "moderate" [...] and [...] "restricted". Users can specify the same criteria when searching for images. There are some restrictions on searches for certain types of users: non-members must always use SafeSearch, which omits images noted as potentially offensive, while members whose Yahoo accounts indicate that they are underage may use SafeSearch or moderate SafeSearch, but cannot turn SafeSearch off completely. The system achieves a fairly good separation of family-friendly photos and adult content; generic image searches normally produce no pornographic results, with the visibility of adult content restricted to users and dedicated Flickr communities who have opted into viewing it.|$|E

40|$|Moodle is an E-Learning {{platform}} {{that is in}} use by many educational institutions across the world. This paper outlines {{the development of a}} Course page <b>Content</b> <b>Filter</b> created in PHP which can be applied to a Moodle course page to filter the course’s learning objects, displaying only those documents matching the filter selections. The Course <b>Content</b> <b>Filter</b> has been developed as a code patch to be installed to the Moodle installation and activated by the Moodle administrator. It comprises of additional settings to both the Moodle course page and the learning object upload pages. Filter controls appear {{at the top of the}} student’s course page allowing a student to actively filter the course page content. The Course <b>Content</b> <b>Filter</b> assists students in navigating to the learning objects relevant to their needs. An example, as described in this paper, is the <b>filtering</b> of course <b>content</b> by Learning Channel. Learning channels are the modes in which a student can take in information. Providing a student with course material in a form relevant to their learning style makes course content more accessible, optimising the learning experience. For example, a student with a preference for their visual learning channel will benefit from course material presented in a visual form. The <b>content</b> <b>filter</b> described here will allow them to quickly access content which is optimised for their learning preference. This paper also outlines advantages of such a <b>content</b> <b>filter</b> in a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), reviews current availability of such filters, and describes our approach to developing such a filter...|$|R
