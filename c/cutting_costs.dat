5|$|Fantasia 2000, {{a sequel}} to the 1940 film {{that had been a}} pet-project of Roy E. Disney's since 1990, was {{released}} on January 1, 2000. Produced in pieces when artists were available between productions, Fantasia 2000 was the first animated feature produced for and released in IMAX format. A standard theatrical release followed in June, but the film's $90 million worldwide box office total against its $90 million production cost resulted in it losing $100 million for the studio. Peter Schneider left his post as president of Walt Disney Feature Animation in 1999 to become president of The Walt Disney Studios under Joe Roth. Thomas Schumacher, who had been Schneider's vice president of animation for several years, became the new president of Walt Disney Feature Animation. By this time, competition from other studios had driven animators' incomes to all-time highs, making traditionally animated features even more costly to produce. Schumacher was tasked with <b>cutting</b> <b>costs,</b> and massive layoffs began to cut salaries and bring the studio's staff– which peaked at 2,200 people in 1999– down to approximately 1,200 employees.|$|E

For {{economical}} {{and environmental}} reasons, {{the aim of}} this research is hence to monitor the cutting conditions with the dry cutting, the wet cutting, and the mist cutting to obtain the proper cutting condition for the plain carbon steel with the ball end milling based on the consideration of the surface roughness of the machined parts, the life of the cutting tools, the use of the cutting fluids, the density of the particles of cutting fluids dispersed in the working area, and the <b>cost</b> of <b>cutting.</b> The experimentally obtained results of the relation between tool wear and surface roughness, the relation between tool wear and cutting force, and the relation between cutting force and surface roughness are correspondent with the same trend. The phenomena of surface roughness and tool wear {{can be explained by the}} in-process cutting forces. The models of the tool wear with the cutting conditions and the cutting times are proposed to estimate the tool cost for the different cooling strategies based on the experimental data using the multiple regression technique. The <b>cutting</b> <b>cost</b> is calculated from the <b>costs</b> of <b>cutting</b> tool and cutting fluid. The mist cutting gives the lowest <b>cutting</b> <b>cost</b> as compared to others.

There were rumors of several parties being interested, including Cerberus, still owning Albertsons assets; however, no suitable offers were received. In May, rumors emerged that A was in more financial trouble as it declared a huge loss (in April) for the previous year, losing more business to better-managed competition. As customers were staying away, A considered its second bankruptcy filing in less than five years. There were rumors that A would sell all stores more than 40 miles from its corporate offices, shrinking the company to about 100 stores; other rumors were that the company would sell all its stores. Rumors also surfaced about a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and total liquidation, selling the company in pieces, as well as a Chapter 11 bankruptcy with selling in pieces. The company remained for sale as a whole, receiving no bids for any of its stores. Other alternatives were explored, including selling other assets.|$|E
