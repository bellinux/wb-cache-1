5|$|To ensure {{baseline}} compatibility {{between different}} HDMI sources and displays (as well as backward compatibility with the electrically compatible DVI standard) all HDMI devices must implement the sRGB color space at 8 bits per component. Ability {{to use the}} YCbCr color space and higher color depths ("deep color") is optional. HDMI permits sRGB 4:4:4 <b>chroma</b> subsampling (8–16 bits per component), xvYCC 4:4:4 <b>chroma</b> subsampling (8–16 bits per component), YCbCr 4:4:4 <b>chroma</b> subsampling (8–16 bits per component), or YCbCr 4:2:2 <b>chroma</b> subsampling (8–12 bits per component).

5|$|Graveyard Mountain Home is {{the third}} studio album {{released}} under the name <b>Chroma</b> Key by American keyboardist Kevin Moore. It was released on November 8, 2004 by InsideOut Music. Moore originally started work on the album in 2003, planning to release a less electronica-influenced album than previous <b>Chroma</b> Key albums, but put it aside {{to work on the}} first OSI album. He then moved to Istanbul, Turkey, where he wrote Ghost Book, the soundtrack to the film Okul. Enjoying the experience of writing music to film, Moore scrapped his previous plans for the third <b>Chroma</b> Key album, instead writing an album as an alternate soundtrack to an already-existing film.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} eight {{iterations}} in the Naga series, {{not counting the}} redesigned versions, with release dates spanning from 2009 to 2016.

All except the Naga Epic and the Naga Epic <b>Chroma</b> are wired and connected through a USB port. The Naga Hex and the Naga Hex v2 are the only iterations to have less than twelve buttons, with six and seven respectively. The Naga 2014 is the only mouse in the series to have a left-handed version. The colors of the mice vary.|$|E
5|$|Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos {{originally}} intended to create a progressive metal supergroup while Fates Warning went on hiatus. He recruited Cynic & Gordian Knot Fretless Bass and Chapman Stickist Sean Malone and then-Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy {{to work on the}} project. Matheos then asked <b>Chroma</b> Key and ex-Dream Theater keyboardist Kevin Moore to contribute by adding keyboard arrangements to the music he had written. Moore instead heavily edited the music, changing the song structures and adding vocals. Matheos decided to pursue this new direction, sounding closer to <b>Chroma</b> Key than standard progressive metal, over his and Portnoy's original idea.|$|E

40|$|In the {{companion}} report [14], {{we have shown}} that a full color image sampled with a rectangular color filter array (CFA) {{is equivalent to the}} frequency domain multiplexing of multiplex components: a luminance component (luma) at the baseband and several chrominance components (<b>chromas)</b> at high frequency bands. A matrix, called the frequency structure of a CFA, is defined to represent this modulation, with which we can easily analyze the characteristics of CFAs. The frequency structure can be computed by applying the symbolic discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to the CFA pattern. In this paper, we present a CFA design methodology in the frequency domain. In this methodology, a good frequency structure of the CFA is first selected, mainly according to the following criteria: (i). the number of nonzero <b>chromas</b> should be as small as possible; (ii). the distance between nonzero multiplex components should be as large as possible; and (iii). dependent (e. g., identical, negative, or conjugate...|$|R

Knoll, who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tatterstall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later.
