The epoxidation reaction of linseed oil manifests itself by the disappearance of the 3010 [*]cm- 1 band and the emergence of oxirane rings indicated by the appearance of two bands at 825 and 845 [*]cm- 1 (Martini et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|The {{accurate}} measuring of flow in rivers {{is essential}} for optimal utilisation of the surface water resources in South Africa. Long-term hydrological records containing the characteristic parameters of change and variability are required for the effective management and conservation of scarce water resources. The runoff from catchments is measured by using gauging structures in rivers and at dams. In South African rivers, the use of <b>compound</b> <b>gauging</b> weirs is common due to the large variation in flows. This allows for accurate measuring of discharge in a river section at low and high flow rates (Wessels & Rooseboom 2009). [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Liver {{diseases}} influence musculoskeletal {{functions and}} may negatively affect the exercise capacity {{of patients with}} cirrhosis. Aim. To test {{the relationship between the}} six-minute walk test (6 MWT), maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and exercise capacity (VO 2 peak) measures and the survival rate of patients with cirrhosis. Methods. This prospective cohort study consisted of 86 patients diagnosed with cirrhosis with the following aetiology: hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and/or alcoholic cirrhosis (AC). All patients were followed up for three years and submitted to the 6 MWT, pressure measurements with a <b>compound</b> <b>gauge,</b> and an exercise test (VO 2 peak). Results. The survival analysis showed that the individuals who covered a distance shorter than 410 [*]m during the 6 MWT had a survival rate of 55 % compared with a rate of 97 % for the individuals who walked more than 410 [*]m (p = 0. 0001). Individuals with MIPs below − 70 [*]cmH 2 O had a survival rate of 62 % compared with a rate of 93 % for those with MIPs above − 70 [*]cmH 2 O (p = 0. 0001). The patients with values below 17 [*]mL/kg had a survival rate of 55 % compared with a rate of 94 % for those with values above 17 [*]mL/kg (p = 0. 0001). Conclusion. The 6 MWT distance, MIP, and oxygen consumption are predictors of mortality in patients with cirrhosis...|$|E

The fluoride enhances the strength of teeth by the formation of fluorapatite, a naturally occurring component of tooth enamel. Although sodium fluoride is used to fluoridate water and, indeed, is the standard by which other water-fluoridation <b>compounds</b> are <b>gauged,</b> hexafluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6) and its salt sodium hexafluorosilicate (Na2SiF6) are more commonly used additives in the U.S. Toothpaste often contains sodium fluoride to prevent cavities, although tin(II) fluoride is generally considered superior for this application.|$|R
50|$|The Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company, which {{operated}} the Wellington-Manawatu line, had four similar locomotives built by Baldwin, two in 1888, one in 1894 {{and one in}} 1896. The WMR locomotives of 1894 and 1896, no. 12 and no. 13, were Vauclain compound locomotives, the first in New Zealand and the first narrow-gauge compounds in the world. While standard <b>gauge</b> <b>compounds</b> usually had the low-pressure cylinder mounted below the high-pressure cylinder on each side, this was often reversed on narrow-gauge locomotives, which had the larger low-pressure cylinders mounted above the high-pressure cylinders to provide greater clearance at platforms.|$|R

As a consequence, only the corresponding mononeutrinos answer for quantization of the electric charges of all neutrinos.

Some logical and laboratory confirmations of the availability of <b>compound</b> structure of <b>gauge</b> invariance have been listed which say also about the connection between the states of elementary particles and monoparticles.

40|$|Microextraction {{has become}} a buzz word {{in the recent years}} in the {{scientific}} area of analytical chemistry. Over the last decade, newer miniaturised approaches to liquid extraction have emerged, resulting in solvent and sample savings and less time consuming analysis. Single-drop microextraction (SDME) has been developed as a viable and easy-to-use method based on the partitioning between sample matrix and organic droplet phase. However, there are numerous examples where analytical derivatizations are required to enhance sensitivity, selectivity, extraction efficiency and overall quality of the data. Improvements resulting from derivatization in instrumental methods are well known. The absence of data in chemical reaction accompanied by mass-transfer in liquid-liquid and gas-liquid microextraction, calls for a meticulous treatment of SDME in-drop derivatization for the purpose of analytical implementation. Leveraging the inherent characteristics of an organic microdrop as a tiny reactor, a threefold aim is set out in order: Ι. to develop a theoretical approximation to the in-drop derivatization SDME using phenolic compounds for liquid-liquid and two aldehydes for gas-liquid, as model <b>compounds,</b> II. to <b>gauge</b> the significance of mass-transfer and chemical reaction in an organic drop viewed as an analytical reactor and III. to underscore the importance of the a priori knowledge of the characteristics of such a system related to its analytical aspects...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of fluorine substitutions on {{the stability of}} benzene is examined by using the Hartree-Fock (HF) and MP 2 models. It is conclusively demonstrated that homodesmotic reactions based on the open-chain zigzag polyenes are unsatisfactory. A comparison of the intramolecular interactions of educts and products shows {{that they are not}} well balanced. Hence, these reactions should be abandoned in discussing aromaticity. A much better vehicle for exploring aromaticity is provided by homostructural reactions, which employ cyclic monoene and diene as reference model compounds. Their heavy atoms are enforced to assume planar geometries to enable ó/ð separation. The HF/cc-pVTZ calculations show that extrinsic aromaticity of benzene B ¢E(ease) B arises both from the ó- and ð-contributions. They are- 14. 8 and- 23. 1 in kcal/mol, respectively, if the stockholder energy partitioning scheme is employed. This result implies that both the ó- and ð-frameworks contribute to the aromatic stabilization of B, the latter being more important. The total aromatic stabilization ¢E(ease) B is- 37. 9 kcal/mol. Schleyer’s indene-isoindene isomerization approach also strongly indicates that the decisive factor in determining the aromatic stability of the benzene moiety is the ð-electron framework. The origin of extrinsic aromaticity is identified as the increased nuclear-electron attraction of both ó- and ð-electrons, if 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene is used as a <b>gauge</b> <b>compound.</b> Further, by using a system of isostructural reactions, it is conclusively demonstrated that fluorobenzenes exhibit a remarkable additivity of the substituen...|$|R
40|$|The soil-transmitted helminthes infect up to {{two billion}} people and are leading causes of {{morbidity}} in the developing world. The only subclass of drugs effective against these parasites in mass drug administration is facing the threat of resistance and is not efficacious against all parasites. With infection rates and demographics this overwhelming, {{there is a growing}} need towards the discovery of new and more efficacious anthelmintics. Past anthelmintic discovery efforts have traditionally utilized veterinary (non-human) parasitic nematodes or non-parasitic nematodes altogether. We ask in the present study - are there superior alternatives to current anthelmintic discovery systems, specifically against human intestinal parasites? In answering this question, I develop and test a moderate-throughput 96 -well format assay for anthelmintic screening against the free- living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and embryonic/ larval stages of the parasitic nematodes Heligmosomoides bakeri, and Ancylostoma ceylanicum. This assay differs from existing larval assays in its capacity to look at a wider range of the parasite's life cycle and, in the case of A. ceylanicum, to incorporate a zoonotic human parasitic nematode. The assay was utilized in screening two small <b>compound</b> libraries to <b>gauge</b> the general overlap of hits between various nematodes and assess the feasibility of these methods. Significantly, compounds that hit on a human parasite would not necessarily be detected on a murine parasite or free-living nematode of the same clade. I discuss the implications of these results on future drug screening, which suggests that a human parasitic nematode could be successfully used for anthelmintic discover...|$|R
