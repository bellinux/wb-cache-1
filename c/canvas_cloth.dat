60|$|It was not {{a pretty}} spot, this little rock-strewn glade where the white hard trail forked with the road. The yellow water with its green scum made Hare sick. The horses drank with loud gulps. Naab and his sons drank of it. The women filled a pail and portioned it out in basins and washed their faces and hands with evident pleasure. Dave Naab whistled as he wielded an axe vigorously on a cedar. It came home to Hare that the tension of the past night and morning had relaxed. Whether to {{attribute}} that fact to the distance from White Sage or to the arrival at the water-hole he could not determine. But the certainty was shown in August's cheerful talk to the horses as he slipped bags of grain over their noses, and in the subdued laughter of the women. Hare sent up an unspoken thanksgiving that these good Mormons had apparently escaped from the dangers incurred for his sake. He sat {{with his back to}} a cedar and watched the kindling of fires, the deft manipulating of biscuit dough in a basin, and the steaming of pots. The generous meal was spread on a <b>canvas</b> <b>cloth,</b> around which men and women sat cross-legged, after the fashion of Indians. Hare found it hard to adapt his long legs to the posture, and he wondered how these men, whose legs were longer than his, could sit so easily. It was the crown of a cheerful dinner after hours of anxiety and abstinence to have Snap Naab speak civilly to him, and to see him bow his head meekly as his father asked the blessing. Snap ate as though he had utterly forgotten that he had recently killed a man; to hear the others talk to him one would suppose that they had forgotten it also.|$|E

The plant had a wide product range of tablecloths, towels, pressings, tarpaulin sheets, and <b>canvas</b> <b>cloths</b> {{made up of}} technical textiles. The name of the company, Group Linum-Taussig, shows that it was about Linum (flax). Linum is a genus of approximately 200 species in the flowering plant family Linaceae, native to temperate and subtropical regions of the world.

6000|$|When {{an animal}} is {{killed in the}} country, {{it is well known}} that the condors, like other carrion-vultures, soon gain {{intelligence}} of it, and congregate in an inexplicable manner. In most cases it must not be overlooked, that the birds have discovered their prey, and have picked the skeleton clean, before the flesh is in the least degree tainted. Remembering the experiments of M. Audubon, on the little smelling powers of carrion-hawks, I tried in the above-mentioned garden the following experiment: the condors were tied, each by a rope, in a long row at the bottom of a wall; and having folded up a piece of meat in white paper, I walked backwards and forwards, carrying it in my hand at the distance of about three yards from them, but no notice whatever was taken. I then threw it on the ground, within one yard of an old male bird; he looked at it for a moment with attention, but then regarded it no more. With a stick I pushed it closer and closer, until at last he touched it with his beak; the paper was then instantly torn off with fury, and at the same moment, every bird in the long row began struggling and flapping its wings. Under the same circumstances it would have been quite impossible to have deceived a dog. The evidence in favour of and against the acute smelling powers of carrion-vultures is singularly balanced. Professor Owen has demonstrated that the olfactory nerves of the turkey-buzzard (Cathartes aura) are highly developed, and on the evening when Mr. Owen's paper was read at the Zoological Society, it was mentioned by a gentleman that he had seen the carrion-hawks in the West Indies on two occasions collect on the roof of a house, when a corpse had become offensive from not having been buried: in this case, the intelligence could hardly have been acquired by sight. On the other hand, besides the experiments of Audubon and that one by myself, Mr. Bachman has tried in the United States many varied plans, showing that neither the turkey-buzzard (the species dissected by Professor Owen) nor the gallinazo find their food by smell. He covered portions of highly-offensive offal with a thin <b>canvas</b> <b>cloth,</b> and strewed pieces of meat on it: these the carrion-vultures ate up, and then remained quietly standing, with their beaks within the eighth of an inch of the putrid mass, without discovering it. A small rent was made in the canvas, and the offal was immediately discovered; the canvas was replaced by a fresh piece, and meat again put on it, and was again devoured by the vultures without their discovering the hidden mass on which they were trampling. These facts are attested by the signatures of six gentlemen, besides that of Mr. Bachman. (9/3. Loudon's [...] "Magazine of Natural History" [...] volume 7.) ...|$|E

He was an aspiring merchant of linen and <b>canvas</b> <b>cloth,</b> and Grenoble at the time was becoming a main commercial center with links to important markets at Arles, Avignon, Lyons, Marseilles and the great annual fair at Beaucaire. He prospered at Grenoble and in 1741 married Marie Dupuy, the daughter of a merchant and one-time municipal consul. Claude Perier, born in 1742, was the first of their seven children. In 1749, Jacques purchased an imposing, multi-story home for the family on the Grande Rue.|$|E

40|$|In {{the period}} under review trade {{relations}} between the Principality of Moldavia and the Russian Empire experienced a new stage of development. Moldavia continued to import consumer goods from the Russian Empire. The increase in the volume of trade between the Russian Empire and the Romanian Principalities took place after {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. Trade relations between the Principality of Moldavia and the Russian Empire were based on the Russian-Turkish trade treaty concluded in 1783. Particularly important and especially expensive imported goods were furs. In addition to the furs, there were imported iron and steel products, which competed with the products from Austria. The government of the Russian Empire encouraged the duty-free importation of large quantities of goods from Russia ostensibly for the army, and this caused damage to the Moldavian treasury. An important role in the import of goods from the Russian Empire into the Principality of Moldavia played merchants, especially foreign ones. The analysis showed that furs, <b>canvas,</b> <b>cloth,</b> iron and ironware, linen, and vodka were predominant among these imports. ...|$|E

40|$|Now forging parts {{papermaking}} machines uses {{many different}} designs presses. Regardless {{of the type}} of construction, the water is filtered through paper to <b>canvas</b> <b>cloth</b> in the transverse direction, filtering water from the cloth can occur in the longitudinal direction (simple presses) or in the transverse direction (shaft with blind holes, grooved shaft, suction shaft). Presses of the native papermaking machines provide a dry cloth when pressed, about 35 ? 40 %. That is not enough, as for drying the paper spent a huge amount of thermal energy in the form of steam, so the development of the press, providing a significant increase in dry is relevant. One way of increasing dryness is usage of shoe press, which by increasing the length of the contact area increased while pressing, so dry cloth before drying section increasing to 50 ? 55 %. Work of presses of papermaking machine is measured by the amount of water removed, and uniform moisture content across the width of fabric after the presses. Dehydration capacity of presses depends primarily on the length of the extrusion zone delighted shaft and on the number of these zones. When pressing simultaneously with dehydration of the paper web changing its structure, increases the contact area between the fibers and the coupling strength between them. In the existing literature does not sufficiently covered shoe-type presses calculation that does not allow constructing them because kinetic regularities of the process is unknown. The {{purpose of this article is}} to establish the kinetics of the compaction and main parameters shoe-type press needed to develop methods of calculation and design shoe presses. In the conventional two-shaft presses created considerable common pressure gradient and significantly lower hydraulic pressure gradient. In the developed design will increase the hydraulic pressure gradient by summing the camera of the shoe-type heated compressed air. Under the influence of the total pressure break down the cell structure of the paper web from which water is removed that the action of hydraulic pressure filtered in cloth, from cloth in the grooves of the shaft.
