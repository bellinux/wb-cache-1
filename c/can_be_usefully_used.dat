Of particular concern are strings that conform to a given grammar, since coverage of grammar productions does not guarantee high code coverage or fault-finding ability.

We compare the code coverage of these techniques and the standard conformance test suites for the grammars.

Other key economic and financial indicators that have impact on the Hong Kong financial market such as yield spreads & forward rates are also considered.

40|$|An {{important}} {{focus in}} empirical econometric studies {{of health care}} concerns estimation of the relationship with health. This paper describes a non-parametric technique, the grade of membership (GoM) procedure, {{which is used to}} construct summary indicators of health. Health status is also assessed using three alternative measures commonly employed in the literature: an index of problems of activities of daily living (ADL), an index of health conditions and overall self-rated health. Using data from a sample of frail older people, the relationship between costs and different measures of health are estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS) and instrumental variables (IV) methods. The results show that health influences costs more strongly than other variables, an effect which persists after controlling for potential endogeneity. It is shown that health <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>usefully</b> classified <b>using</b> GoM techniques. An alternative measure, based on an index of ADL, also performs well. Measures based on overall self-assessed health and the number of health conditions present were less satisfactory. Although health indicators derived from GoM techniques may be more theoretically attractive, in terms of capturing more fully the multidimensional nature of health, simpler alternatives such as those based on ADL indices may offer practical computational advantages.

Following these threads makes it possible to reveal ways of thinking about Dewey’s pragmatism and education that take it beyond its limitations. Those limitations are to be understood in terms of a restricted account of problem-solving, instrumentalism, unqualified aversion to skepticism, and the absence of a tragic sense. Yet a greater sensitivity to these matters is there recessively in Dewey’s writings, and the reading of his work contrapuntally with aspects of Thoreau’s, helps to bring these to light.

40|$|Background The {{problem of}} {{inferring}} effective brain connectivity from functional connectivity is under active investigation, and connectivity via multistep paths is poorly understood. New method A method {{is presented to}} calculate the direct effective connection matrix (deCM), which embodies direct connection strengths between brain regions, from functional CMs (fCMs) by minimizing {{the difference between an}} experimental fCM and one calculated via neural field theory from an ansatz deCM based on an experimental anatomical CM. Results The best match between fCMs occurs close to a critical point, consistent with independent published stability estimates. Residual mismatch between fCMs is identified to be largely due to interhemispheric connections that are poorly estimated in an initial ansatz deCM due to experimental limitations; improved ansatzes substantially reduce the mismatch and enable interhemispheric connections to be estimated. Various levels of significant multistep connections are then imaged via the neural field theory (NFT) result that these correspond to powers of the deCM; these are shown to be predictable from geometric distances between regions. Comparison with existing methods This method gives insight into direct and multistep effective connectivity from fCMs and relating to physiology and brain geometry. This contrasts with other methods, which progressively adjust connections without an overarching physiologically based framework to deal with multistep or poorly estimated connections. Conclusions deCMs <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>usefully</b> estimated <b>using</b> this method and the results enable multistep connections to be investigated systematically...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUsing both Brownian and {{molecular}} dynamics, we replicate {{many of the}} salient features of Kv 1. 2, including the current-voltage-concentration profiles and the binding affinity and binding mechanisms of charybdotoxin, a scorpion venom. We also elucidate how structural differences in the inner vestibule can give rise to significant differences in its permeation characteristics. Current-voltage-concentration profiles are constructed using Brownian dynamics simulations, based on the crystal structure 2 A 79. The results are compatible with experimental data, showing similar conductance, rectification, and saturation with current. Unlike KcsA, for example, the inner pore of Kv 1. 2 is mainly hydrophobic and neutral, and to explore the consequences of this, we investigate the effect of mutating neutral proline residues {{at the mouth of}} the inner vestibule to charged aspartate residues. We find an increased conductance, less inward rectification, and quicker saturation of the current-voltage profile. Our simulations use modifications to our Brownian dynamics program that extend the range of channels that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>usefully</b> modeled. <b>Using</b> molecular dynamics, we investigate the binding of the charybdotoxin scorpion venom to the outer vestibule of the channel. A potential of mean force is derived using umbrella sampling, giving a dissociation constant within a factor of ∼ 2 to experimentally derived constants.
