50|$|Some private branch {{exchange}} (PBX) telephone systems use a paging facility {{that acts as a}} liaison between the telephone and a PA amplifier. In other systems, paging equipment is not built into the telephone system. Instead the system includes a separate paging controller connected to a trunk port of the telephone system. The paging controller is accessed as either a designated directory number or <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>line.</b> In many modern systems, the paging function is integrated into the telephone system, and allows announcements to be played over the phone speakers.|$|E
5000|$|A private branch {{exchange}} (PBX) is a telephone exchange or switching system that serves a private organization and performs concentration of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>lines</b> or trunks and provides intercommunication between {{a large number of}} telephone stations in the organization. The <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>lines</b> provide connections to the public switched telephone network and the concentration aspect of a PBX permits the shared use of these lines between all stations in the organization. [...] allows two or more stations to directly connect while not using the public switched telephone network.|$|R
50|$|The {{mounting}} panels varied {{according to}} the size {{and complexity of the}} telephone system. Typical early 1A2 systems used the Type 583 and 584 panels. The 584C panel contained an interrupter and 13 KTUs. The 583 panel did not have the interrupter and held 15 KTUs. For smaller installations, panels were available that housed all components, including the power supply and connecting blocks. Typically these panels supported only four to six <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R

50|$|The 1A2 {{system used}} a modular plug-in {{construction}} concept that permitted many configurations {{using the same}} basic components. A typical system consisted of a basic metal mounting frame, the Key Service Unit (KSU), also called a panel, with card-edge connectors and mounting brackets for components and punch-down blocks for interconnecting cabling. The principal switching and control modules were constructed on printed circuit boards, called Key Telephone Units (KTU). KTUs provided many system features, such as various types of line interfaces, dial intercom, music-on-hold, and alarms. Each <b>central</b> <b>office</b> telephone <b>line</b> connected to the system required at least one KTU.|$|R

50|$|Telephone {{service in}} Minneapolis first began in 1878 with a {{switchboard}} {{located in the}} old city hall, located in the Gateway area, and serving 11 phones. Demand increased rapidly, and in 1885, the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> had 775 <b>lines</b> and {{was moved to the}} second floor of the city hall building. In 1890, the office outgrew its quarters in the city hall, with 1700 lines, so it moved to a building on Fourth Street between Nicollet and Marquette Avenues. Demand increased to 3000 subscribers in 1897, so a three-story building was built at Third Avenue South and Fifth Street. In 1908, two five-story wings were built. Additional <b>central</b> <b>office</b> buildings were established outside downtown Minneapolis. By 1920, there were 96,000 telephones in 14 <b>central</b> <b>office</b> buildings.|$|R

With the growth of traffic volume in telecom networks, the energy consumption and carbon footprint increase rapidly. Therefore, as the awareness of sustainable environment increases, all industries including Telco have started their green initiatives to reduce the energy consumption that will lead to the reduction of carbon emission. In general, typical telecom networks can be divided into several sections which are core, metro and access network. In this explanatory research, it aims to focus on the access network so called the “last mile”, to analyse the impact of Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) as fixed access network technology to power consumption and carbon footprint in Malaysia. In Malaysia, GPON is being deployed to provide broadband service; among other access technology such as Digital Subscriber Loop (DSL). GPON technology utilizes fiber optic to connect the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> equipment (Optical <b>Line</b> Terminal-OLT) to the customer device (Optical Network Unit –ONU).

50|$|A {{telephone}} exchange name or <b>central</b> <b>office</b> name was a distinguishing and memorable name {{assigned to a}} <b>central</b> <b>office.</b> It identified the switching system to which a telephone was connected. Each <b>central</b> <b>office</b> served a maximum of 10,000 subscriber lines identified by the last four digits of the telephone number. Areas or cities with more subscribers were served by multiple <b>central</b> <b>offices,</b> possibly hosted in the same building.

40|$|Instructional {{leadership}} for school leaders is a complex, multifaceted task. <b>Central</b> <b>office</b> leaders {{can and must}} support the instructional leadership of school leaders. Yet the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> can sometimes present roadblocks that make it challenging for principals to be effective instructional leaders. Complicating matters {{is the impact of}} context, which can influence the ways that the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> supports or hinders the instructional leadership of school administrators. ^ This exploratory study examined the ways that the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> supported or hindered the instructional leadership of school administrators. It also examined the way that school district size, type and access to resources may have impacted those interactions. Participants included <b>central</b> <b>office</b> staff involved in teaching and learning as well as school principals and assistant principals in six public school districts in Pennsylvania. A qualitative design was employed. Fifty-one participants were interviewed and asked to provide documents related to curriculum, instruction, professional development, and/or assessment. ^ <b>Central</b> <b>office</b> administrators played a role in managing curriculum, assessment, professional development, and expectations in school districts. Supportive practices included fostering connections between and among school administrators, skill-building/mentoring, and shielding school administrators from community issues and state mandates. Practices that created roadblocks included lack of expertise and quality work products, failure to bring school administrators together around collaborative work, lack of trusting relationships, and failure to shield school administrators from community issues and state mandates. Tension around the balance between school autonomy and coherence to district mandates/needs, the process of change, feedback and accountability, and philosophical differences created additional roadblocks. Context was a relevant factor in the areas of trust and relationships, the amount of autonomy granted to school administrators, and the role of resources. ^ Four main conclusions were drawn. In the districts studied, there was little work on the part of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> around instructional strategies. The <b>central</b> <b>office</b> played a more direct role as instructional leaders in schools housed in smaller districts. When the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> engaged in supportive practices, fewer tensions were reported by participants within districts.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), College of Education, Washington State UniversitySchool {{district}} <b>central</b> <b>offices</b> {{have increasingly}} {{been identified as}} important actors {{in the implementation of}} new education policy initiatives. This qualitative case study focuses on {{the ways in which the}} <b>central</b> <b>office</b> in a mid-sized school district supported school principals in implementing newly adopted teacher and principal evaluation criteria. The study examined how the school district's <b>central</b> <b>office</b> supported principals in their planning, preparation, and implementation of the new teacher and principal evaluation system (TPEP) in Washington State. Two research questions guided the completion of this research study: (a) What types of activities took place between the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> and the principals; and (b) Did the principals perceive these activities as helpful to their pursuit of effective implementation of the TPEP initiative in their school buildings? The findings highlight the importance of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators as boundary spanners in supporting the principals' development as leaders who have the capacity to enact the new evaluation criteria. Two themes emerged from interviews, observations and the review of documents. First, the use of existing district structures and relationships to support implementation at the school level was vital to the successful adoption of the evaluation criteria. This included working together as partners during the implementation and using common language from previous work within the district to achieve broadly shared understanding of the evaluation requirements. The second theme highlighted the importance of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators providing everyday support to school principals. Everyday support included providing meaningful professional development; engaging in regular meetings; working and learning with the school administrators; and engaging in constant, consistent communication about the implementation of the policy. Collectively, the findings highlight how important it is that <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators consistently review their leadership practices with principals to ensure that they are providing meaningful structures and support. Further research on the ways in which <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators support principals is needed. In particular, research that focuses on how <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators measure their own practices relative to principal needs is urgently needed. Such consideration is particularly important as new policy initiatives demand that <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators create and establish effective support for school principals.
