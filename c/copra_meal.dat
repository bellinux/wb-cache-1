30|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of enzyme complex on in vitro dry matter (DM) digestibility for feed ingredients. The objective of experiment 1 was to screen feed ingredients that can be effective substrates for an enzyme complex, mainly consisted of β-pentosanase, β-glucanase and α-amylase, using in vitro digestibility methods. In experiment 1, the test ingredients were three grain sources (barley, corn and wheat) and six protein supplements (canola <b>meal,</b> <b>copra</b> expellers, cottonseed <b>meal,</b> distillers dried grains with solubles, palm kernel expellers and soybean meal). In vitro ileal and total tract digestibility (IVID and IVTTD, respectively) of DM for test ingredients were determined. In vitro digestibility methods consisted of two- or three-step procedure simulating in vivo digestion in the pig gastrointestinal tracts with or without enzyme complex. As the enzyme complex added, the IVID of DM for corn and wheat increased (p <  0.05) by 5.0 and 2.6 percentage unit, respectively. The IVTTD of DM for corn increased (p <  0.05) by 3.1 percentage unit with enzyme complex addition. As the effect of enzyme complex was the greatest in corn digestibility, corn grains were selected to determine the in vitro digestibility of the fractions (starch, germ, hull and gluten) that maximally respond to the enzyme complex in experiment 2. The IVID of DM for corn starch, germ and hull increased (p <  0.05) by 16.0, 2.8 and 1.2 percentage unit, respectively. The IVTTD of DM for corn starch and hull also increased (p <  0.05) by 8.6 and 0.9 percentage unit, respectively, with enzyme complex addition. In conclusion, the enzyme complex increases in vitro DM digestibility of corn and wheat, and the digestibility increments of corn are mainly attributed to the increased digestibility of corn starch.|$|R

40|$|Fish {{production}} from aquaculture in Indonesia {{continues to grow}} rapidly from 1. 7 million mt in 2009 to 4. 0 million mt (excluding seaweed) in 2013. This {{is consistent with the}} increase of total aqua feed {{production from}} 995, 000 mt in 2009 to 1. 42 million mt in 2013 and about 90 % of feed distributed to the farming area is produced by the feed industry. To meet the demand from the rapidly growing aquaculture industry, {{there is a need to}} develop new high-quality protein ingredients to reduce dependence on fish meal (FM). Despite high production of local FM in Indonesia, only around 5 % of total production is used for aquafeed and the rest is exported mainly to Japan. Efforts toward reduction of using FM in commercial diets have been done in particular for freshwater species. Nowadays the content of FM in commercial diet for freshwater species is around 5 - 11 %. Shrimp and marine species are still formulated to contain FM in range of 20 - 30 % for shrimp and > 30 % for marine species. Utilization of plant ingredients in particular soy bean meal (SBM) has partially replaced FM as dietary protein. However, SBM is also obtained entirely by import as all national production of soybean in the country are for tempe and tofu processing. Since almost 70 % of components in commercial diet is imported ingredients, prices of commercial aquafeed increased through the years and are not competitive compared with price of fish in particular those categorized as low value species like carp, tilapia, catfish, Pangasius and milkfish. In several areas in Indonesia including Sumatera and Kalimantan Island, small-scale feed industry or on-farm feed making has been developed by individual or farmer group due to the limited access to commercial diets. Generally, the farmers use local feed ingredients which are available in their areas such as local fish meal, copra/palm cake meal, rice bran and tapioca. However, the quality of the diets produced varies among groups. Many nutritional studies have been conducted to find alternative protein sources. Local animal sources including shrimp head meal, blood meal, golden snail and vermi meal can be included in diet at rate of 8 - 30 % for grouper species. The use of plant ingredients has been extensively evaluated particularly on herbivorous and omnivorous species to develop least-cost diet formulation. Plant ingredients containing > 20 % protein such as <b>copra</b> cake <b>meal,</b> rubber seed, Leucaena leaf, and aquatic weed could be used in diet at different levels from 10 - 60 % depending on the species. The presence of anti-nutritional compounds in plant ingredients is the main constraint in their use in aquafeed. Bio-processing using proper microorganism has been developed to improve their quality. More focus and in-depth research to minimize the negative effects of anti-nutritional compounds and to develop technique of their mass production are recommended...|$|R

This study was conducted to determine the physical characteristics and feeding value of <b>copra</b> <b>meal.</b> Physical characteristics were determined by measuring the bulk density and water holding capacity of <b>copra</b> <b>meal</b> and a digestibility study was undertaken to investigate nutrient digestibility, jejunal digesta viscosity and apparent metabolizable energy of <b>copra</b> <b>meal.</b> A total of 28 day old male Ross chicks were given control starter and grower diets from day 1 to 35. From day 36 to 42, the birds were fed an experimental diet. Faeces were collected for three consecutive days.

Data indicated that bulk density and water holding capacity of <b>copra</b> <b>meal</b> were poor, being 0. 49 g/cm 3 and 4. 69 g water / g feed respectively.

30|$|Mannooligosaccharides {{are derived}} from the cell wall of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is commercially {{available}} as a feed supplement (Ferket et al. 2002). However, {{they can also be}} produced from plant mannan, such as konjac, ivory nut, locust bean, palm kernel, coffee bean, and <b>copra</b> <b>meal.</b> <b>Copra</b> <b>meal</b> is a by-product of the coconut milk process and contains a large amount of mannose in the form of mannan. Mannan consists of repeating β- 1, 4 mannose units and a few α- 1, 6 -galactose units attached to a β- 1, 4 mannose backbone (Mohammad et al. 1996).|$|E
30|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{characterization}} of mannanase from Bacillus circulans NT 6.7 for mannooligosaccharides (MOS) production. The enzyme from B. circulans NT 6.7 was produced using defatted <b>copra</b> <b>meal</b> as a carbon source. The mannanase was purified by ultrafiltration and column chromatography of Q-Sepharose. The purified protein (M 1) was a dimeric protein with a 40  kDa subunit. The purified M 1 exhibited optimum pH and temperature at pH 6.0 and 60  °C, respectively. It was activated by Mn 2 +, Mg 2 +, and Cu 2 +, and as inhibited by EDTA (45 – 65  %). The purified enzyme exhibited high specificity to beta-mannan: konjac (glucomannan), locust bean gum (galactomannan), ivory nut (mannan), guar gum (galactomannan) and defatted <b>copra</b> <b>meal</b> (galactomannan). The defatted <b>copra</b> <b>meal</b> could be hydrolyzed by purified M 1 into mannooligosaccharides which promoted beneficial bacteria, especially Lactobacillus group, and inhibited pathogenic bacteria; Shigella dysenteria DMST 1511, Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 029, and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis DMST 17368. Therefore, the mannanase from B. circulans NT 6.7 would be a novel source of enzymes for the mannooligosaccharides production as prebiotics.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} {{examine the effect of}} pellet size and fibrous diet on intestinal passage time of feed in the digestive tract of broilers. A total of 64 day old chicks were used in a completely randomized factorial design with two different diets (<b>copra</b> <b>meal</b> and corn-soy based diets) and two pellet size (fine and coarse). On day 1 - 5 of week seven, the birds were fed the experimental diets. On day 6, after a 12 h feed restriction, all birds were orally administered with 85 mg chromium oxide in a gelatine capsule. Four birds per treatment were killed by cervical dislocation. Gizzard and small intestine were weighed and opened. The colour of the digesta observed to visually determine the location of the chromium oxide. The faeces were observed for first appearance of entire coloured faeces and then on an hourly basis up to the disappearance of coloured faeces. The experimental design was a two way factorial with two basal diets and pellet sizes. Data indicated that a <b>copra</b> <b>meal</b> diet moved in the digestive tract was slower than a corn-soy diet. The first appearance of the marker in the faeces of birds fed the <b>copra</b> <b>meal</b> diet was 52 min later than for those fed the corn-soy diet. The movement in the digestive tract of the fine ground diets was slower than that of the coarse diets. The effect of pellet size on feed passage time was only evident in the <b>copra</b> <b>meal</b> based diet...|$|E
