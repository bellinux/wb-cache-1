40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the problems of}} procedural premises in proceedings for rendering a cumulative judgment. There are some modifications of premises in those proceedings in comparison with ordinary proceedings. Namely, beside some modified general premises there are also special premises, characteristic only for proceedings for rendering a cumulative judgment. The said proceedings are conditioned upon theree general positive procedural premises: a) being subject to Polish criminal courts, b) jurisdiction, c) the existence of litigant parties. To general negative premises belong: 1) immunities (Art. 11 sec. 3 of the Criminal Procedure Code), 2) the lapse of the prercribed statute of limitation (Art. 11 sec. 6 of the Criminal Procedure Code), 3) material validity (Art. 11 sec. 7 of the Criminal Procedure Code), 4) pendency of the litigation (Art. 11 sec. 7 of the Criminal Procedure Code), 5) amnesty as a negative premise not mentioned in Art. 11 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Special premises are specific factors, the existence {{of which is a}} condition of rendering a cumulative judgment. From that point of view one can distinguish: 1) special material premises, 2) a special procedural premise. Special material premises are regulated in the Criminal Code (Art. 66, 68, 69, 71 § 2). Those provisions allow to distinguish the following premises: 1) real <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>offences,</b> 2) concurrence of penalties. A special procedural premise is formal validity of separate judgments sentencing for concurring offences (Art. 503 § 1 of the Criminal Procedure Code). The admissibility of proceedings for rendering a cumulative judgment depends on a simultaneous appearance of general and special premisesDigitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|E

40|$|<b>Concurrence</b> <b>of</b> {{duties of}} a member of the Board of Directors and an {{employee}} within a joint-stock company The aim of this thesis is to describe a situation, where a member of the Board of Directors of a joint-stock company is simultaneously an employee of the same company (so called <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> duties) and to analyze problems arising from this situation. In this context it is important to show the differences between labour-law relationship and commercial-law relationship, as well as to look at <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> duties in the past. An amendment to the Commercial Code made performance of the business management in the framework of parallel labour-law relationship possible, but the recodification of Civil Law that shall come into effect as of January 1, 2014 does not take <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> duties into consideration. One of the most important parts of this thesis will be thus looking for an answer to the question, what the situation regarding <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> duties will be in the future. The second crucial problem, that this thesis is focused on, is issue <b>of</b> <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> the powers to act on behalf of the company, i. e. if a member of the Board of Directors is entitled to act even as a contractual or legal representative of a company.
