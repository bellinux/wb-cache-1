40|$|The {{importance}} of the emigration level as a key control variable for the disarmament process is discussed and confirmed. The mathematical formulation of the optimal <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>disarmament</b> leads {{to the problem of}} the optimal time control for a system described by the two Richardson linear differential equations. The problem is readily resolved by means of the Pontriagin maximum principle. An illustrative example is presented which clearly shows that arms levels cannot be used as control variables; this explains the permanent failure of talks on the reduction of arms. Moreover, it shows where to look for ways of actual peace strengthening based on disarmament. Peace between small and large nations is defended now by the balance of deterrence. But this balance is by no means stable; it can be torpedoed by any random circumstances (in...|$|E

50|$|The Commission {{commenced}} {{its work}} {{against the background of}} more than a half-century's striving for non-proliferation, arms <b>control</b> and <b>disarmament</b> <b>of</b> weapons of mass destruction. While there has been much success and progress, especially {{after the end of the}} Cold War, there have been many difficulties and disappointments in recent years. The technical evolution and the access to knowledge have also reduced some barriers to the acquisition of weapons. The possession and potential use of weapons of mass destruction by states or non-state actors remain ever-present risks. The slowdown and stalemate in the fields <b>of</b> non-proliferation, arms <b>control</b> and disarmament needs to be reversed and the momentum needs to be regained. Major contributions to national and international security would result.|$|R

40|$|The {{economics}} <b>of</b> <b>disarmament</b> {{is a new}} discipline. It involves analyses on {{the economic}} causes of the arms race, the definitions <b>of</b> <b>disarmament</b> and the economic determinants and military expenditure. Simultaneously, disarmament is considered {{as an obstacle to}} economic development, a peace dividend or an investment. The construction of economic models <b>of</b> <b>disarmament</b> produces some controversial results. Questions arise concerning the economic effects of a reduction in military expenditure on growth, employment, inflation, budget deficits, the costs of conversion or the dual use of military products, capital capacity and R&D. Long term disarmament needs a development process and an adequate public policy. ...|$|R
