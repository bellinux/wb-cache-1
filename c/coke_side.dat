50|$|In 2007, {{under the}} name Katrin the Thrill, she participated in the Coca-Cola Sounwave music contest, and won a place among the best music acts. Her song If You Believe in Dreams was {{included}} in the Music on the <b>coke</b> <b>side</b> of life compilation. For the next two years she performed in Greece in various music stages and festivals, among them, Terra Vibe Park, Gagarin 205, Vrachon Theater, European Music Day, Bios, Athens Gay Pride, Festival Against Racism, Indie Free Festival and shared the stage with Electrelane, Manic Street Preachers, Greg Dulli and Chinawoman. In 2009, following the devastating fires that swept through Greece, as well as many other places around the world, the concept for Earth is calling us EP was devised, and the need to take action and help reforestation was fully realized.|$|E
5000|$|Coca-Cola Middle East {{have always}} {{incorporated}} International Coke slogans into pan-Arab campaigns with Nancy. In 2007, Coca-Cola released their international trademark campaign of their popular slogan [...] "The <b>Coke</b> <b>Side</b> of Life", {{which focused on}} themes such as fun, happiness, colors, and life. A collaboration with Nancy Ajram lead to {{the making of the}} song [...] "El Donia Helwa" [...] (The World is Beautiful) for which a commercial was filmed with an American director on international standards and hi-tech effects. Nancy insisted on filming in Lebanon which had been hit by war a while back. [...] "El Donia Helwa" [...] is considered Coca-Cola Middle East's and Ajram's most successful commercial to date; the single became one of Ajram's most successful songs, leading to its release as a single track in a [...] "Live" [...] album with live performances from her last studio album Ya Tabtab...Wa Dallaa.|$|E
30|$|An {{obvious way}} to use CO 2 in {{chemical}} synthesis is its reduction to CO followed by syngas (a mixture of H 2, CO and CO 2) chemistry. This can be performed by hydrogen or methane known as reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) reaction [Eq. (2)] and dry reforming of methane [Eq. (3)], respectively. Both reactions are endothermic and favored at high temperatures and susceptible to <b>coke</b> forming <b>side</b> reactions.|$|R
5000|$|Walker founded Wilson, Walker & Co. in 1872, {{a company}} {{producing}} bar iron, railroad car forgings, and rail plates. In 1886, {{the company was}} bought by Carnegie, Phipps & Company and Walker became chairman of the board. [...] As a director of Frick <b>Coke</b> Co., he <b>sided</b> with Frick over Carnegie in their clash to control American steel production. [...] Carnegie offered Walker a $3,000,000 share of Carnegie Steel to change sides; Walker refused to double-cross his friend Frick. [...] Walker retired in 1888.|$|R
50|$|The first process {{used was}} the {{carbonization}} and partial pyrolysis of coal. The off gases liberated in the high-temperature carbonization (coking) of coal in coke ovens were collected, scrubbed {{and used as}} fuel. Depending on {{the goal of the}} plant, the desired product was either a high quality coke for metallurgical use, with the gas being a side product or the production of a high quality gas with <b>coke</b> being the <b>side</b> product. <b>Coke</b> plants are typically associated with metallurgical facilities such as smelters, and blast furnaces, while gas works typically served urban areas.|$|R
40|$|Without marketing, sodas {{would be}} known {{only for the}} {{ingredients}} listed on their bottles and cans. Instead, they {{are known for their}} elaborate campaigns and catchy jingles. The three companies that produce the majority of the industry’s 450 soft drinks—Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Cadbury Schweppes*—make sure of that. 1 You can walk on “The <b>Coke</b> <b>Side</b> of Life ” or “Drink Pepsi, Get Stuff ” (or buy both and get double the amount of branded T-shirts and other “stuff”). If marketing didn’t work, the Coca-Cola Company wouldn’t pay $ 35 million a year to co-sponsor American Idol, and Pepsi wouldn’t have invested $ 1. 2 billion in 2008 just to revamp its logo. Much of the cost for this change has gone toward replacing the old Pepsi logo with the new one everywhere it appears around the world: trucks, vending machines, stadium signs, and point-of-sale materials. 2 The marketing blitz is more than just business as usual; it’s part of the soda industry’s response to the country’s declining consumption of full-calorie soda, which has been sliding for the past decade. As obesity rates rise and type 2 diabetes—once unheard of in children—becomes commonplace, more people than ever are drinking diet sodas or switching to other bever...|$|E
40|$|Explains further {{his remarks}} on accenting plant names. [Augustin] de Candolle's term "carpella" should be "carpelli". Cannot work out term "sepala" but thinks Smith need not use it.

50|$|Level four 1847 to 1900: the {{original}} {{floor of the}} building. The building was the same shape {{as it is today}} but had a wooden floor divided into six cells which were in use by female prisoners from 1847 to 1867 when the building was converted to work rooms and a Matron's room. The Matron's room contained a fireplace with the coke to fuel it stored beneath the floor of the room opposite. A wall outside of the Matron's room had traces of <b>coke</b> on both <b>sides</b> but may have been from a forge used during the earlier construction. Found in the cracks of the floorboards were needles, pins, thimbles, oakum, string and buttons.|$|R
40|$|More than 50 % of {{hot metal}} {{production}} worldwide {{takes place in}} blast furnaces. Coke {{is the most expensive}} raw material in the blast furnace. It acts as the burden support as well as heat source and reductant in the blast furnace. As technology advances, supplementary fuels can supply heat and reduce the iron oxides, but coke would always be needed as burden support. Blast furnaces have been using coke for the past century and will continue to use coke for the next few decades. The price of coke is determined by its quality. Strict environmental laws and regulations in the USA pushed coke-making technology since the early 1990 s towards the beehive type of oven. Gas collected during the coke cycle is used to supply heat to the process. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the spatial variation and coke quality in the non-recovery ovens and provide an explanation for it. The original coal was tested and samples of the coke were obtained from the top, bottom and <b>sides</b> of a <b>coke</b> oven. The samples were prepared and submitted for image analysis to determine the porosity, cell wall thickness and pore diameter. The samples were also submitted for a microscopical point counting to determine the micro textures of the coke. The coke was further submitted for the coke strength after reaction testing (CSR). The results show clear variation in the coke and a model of the behavior of the gas inside the coke oven during the carbonization process was developed based on the results of the tests. The model shows the flow of gas from the bottom of the oven up along the sidewalls to escape from the coke charge through the top. The flow of gas enriched the <b>coke</b> on the <b>side</b> of the oven by deposition of pyrolitic carbon to create an ultra-high grade of coke that could physically be separated from the rest of the coke and be sold separately at a higher price.
