Large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> to occur, including the formation of organic polyatomic species. Much of this chemistry is driven by collisions. Energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold, dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium, resulting, for example, in the trihydrogen cation.

30|$|However, the {{combined}} effects {{of heat and}} mass transfer and <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> {{play a vital role}} in chemical and hydro-metallurgical industries. The <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> can be of any order, but the most simple of which is the <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> of first order where the reaction rate and species concentration are directly proportional to each other. The formation of Smog is an example of first order <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction.</b> In several <b>chemical</b> engineering processes, <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> between foreign mass and working fluid often occurs because of stretching a sheet. The diffusive species can be absorbed or generated due to different types of <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> with the ambient fluid which is greatly influenced by the properties and quality of end product. Kandasamy and Periasamy [21] investigated heat and mass transfer free convection flow of Newtonian fluid past nonlinearly stretching sheet in the presence of <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> and magnetic field. The laminar boundary layer flow of electrically conducted fluid towards nonlinearly stretching sheet under the influence of first-order <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> was theoretically studied by Raptis and Perdikis [22]. On the other hand, the numerical and analytical solutions of steady-state boundary layer flow of micropolar fluid induced due to nonlinearly stretching sheet were found by Damseh et al. [23] and Magyari and Chamkha [24], respectively. The combined effects of slip and <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> on electrically conducting fluid over a nonlinearly porous stretching sheet were analyzed by Yazdi et al. [25]. In the same year, Bhattacharyya and Layek [26] investigated the velocity slip effects on boundary layer flow of viscous fluid past a permeable stretching sheet in the presence of <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction.</b> The steady two-dimensional boundary layer flow of Newtonian fluid due to stretching sheet saturated in nanofluid in the presence of <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> is explored by Kameswaran at al.

[28] studied theoretically the influence of thermal radiation on unsteady natural convection flow caused by stretching surface in the presence of <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> and magnetic field. Shehzad et al.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} new {{numerical}} modelling to examine environmental chemodynamics of a gaseous material exchanged between {{the air and}} turbulent water phases across a gas–liquid interface, followed by an aquarium <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction.</b> This study uses an extended concept of a two-compartment model, and assumes two physicochemical substeps to approximate the gas exchange processes. The first substep is the gas–liquid equilibrium between the air and water phases, A(g) ⇌A(aq), with Henryʼs law constant H. The second is a first-order irreversible <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> in turbulent water, A(aq) +H 2 O→B(aq) +H+ with a <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> rate κA. A direct numerical simulation (DNS) technique has been employed to obtain details of the gas exchange mechanisms and the <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> in the water compartment, while zero velocity and uniform concentration of A is considered in the air compartment. The study uses the different Schmidt numbers between 1 and 8, and six nondimensional <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> rates between 10 −∞(≈ 0) to 101 at a fixed Reynolds number. It focuses {{on the effects of}} the Schmidt number and the <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> rate on fundamental mechanisms of the gas exchange processes across the interface...|$|R
