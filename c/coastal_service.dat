5|$|By October 1938, {{the ship}} had been renamed Pan Gulf to reflect the naming style of her new owners, the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, a {{subsidiary}} of Waterman Steamship Company. The Pan-Atlantic Line sailed in <b>coastal</b> <b>service</b> along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, {{and it is likely}} that Pan Gulf called at typical Pan-Atlantic ports such as Baltimore, Miami, Tampa, New Orleans, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston during this time.|$|E
5|$|In August 1933, the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} that the Shepard Line had secured a year-long charter of Exford for their expanded intercoastal service between North Atlantic ports and the Pacific ports of Los Angeles; San Francisco; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle. Later in 1933, the ship was renamed Pan Royal to reflect the naming style of her new owners, the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, a subsidiary of Waterman Steamship Company.

25|$|Ålesund {{was to be}} {{connected}} both to Oslo Airport, Fornebu, and to a <b>coastal</b> <b>service</b> from Stavanger Airport, Sola via Bergen Airport, Flesland and Ålesund to Trondheim Airport, Værnes. The latter had been operated by Vestlandske Luftfartselskap, but they went bankrupt in 1957. Both Braathens SAFE and SAS applied for the Ålesund concession. Initially the ministry wanted to award the <b>coastal</b> <b>service</b> to Braathens and the Oslo route to SAS. But after negotiations, Braathens SAFE stated {{they were willing to}} fly the coastal route without subsidies if they were granted the Oslo-route, allowing them to cross-subsidize the former. This was accepted by the ministry.|$|E
25|$|In 1904, in {{response}} to complaints about the Reid service, the Newfoundland government subidized the use of two outside vessels for the <b>coastal</b> <b>service,</b> the Portia and Prospero, and in 1912, set up a similar arrangement {{for use of the}} Sagona and Fogota.|$|E
25|$|The first {{aircraft}} to land {{was a military}} de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter, on 19 May 1958 with supplies for the navigational aids. Braathens landed a Heron on 2 June. The official opening took place on 7 June with 3,000 spectators. Flights were at first flown using the Douglas DC-4.

50|$|In {{the first}} few years its routes were limited to <b>coastal</b> <b>services</b> in the western area of Japan. In 1890, OSK inaugurated an Osaka-Pusan run {{followed}} in 1893 by the operation of an Osaka-Incheon route and Korean <b>coastal</b> <b>services.</b> The company was recapitalized at ¥1.8 million in 1893, rising to ¥2.5 million in 1894, to ¥5 million in 1896, when the government of Taiwan granted OSK subsidies for Osaka-Taiwan liner services, and to ¥10 million in 1898 when the company started to operate on the Yangtze River.|$|R

25|$|The side-lever {{engine was}} the first type of steam engine to be widely adopted for marine use in Europe. In {{the early years of}} steam {{navigation}} (from c1815), the side-lever was {{the most common type of}} marine engine for inland waterway and <b>coastal</b> <b>service</b> in Europe, and it remained for many years the preferred engine for oceangoing service on both sides of the Atlantic.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{planning}} {{of a land}} airport for Agder was launched. Arendal Municipal Council proposed that the town be selected as host, and proposed Vessøyslettene as a suitable location in May 1935. Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik was selected as Agder's main airport, opening in 1939. This caused the <b>coastal</b> <b>service</b> past Agder to be terminated. Arendal would ultimately receive a general aviation airport with the 1996 opening of Arendal Airport, Gullknapp.|$|E
25|$|In June 1930, Marian Otis Chandler {{was placed}} into service between Los Angeles and Hawaii after the LASSCO liner City of Honolulu was badly damaged in a fire. Marian Otis Chandler {{continued}} making runs to Hawaii until early 1931, when she resumed <b>coastal</b> <b>service.</b> Over {{the next few}} years she operated from Los Angeles to west coast ports such as Seattle and Aberdeen, Washington; Portland and St. Helens, Oregon; and to east coast ports including Richmond, Virginia and Philadelphia.|$|E

During her regular <b>coastal</b> <b>service</b> in the 1920s and 1930s the ship repeatedly had to come to the assistance of ships in difficulties. In 1926 she assisted the 556 ton steamer Pallas after the latter had run aground off Grønøy and in 1927 she helped a British trawler after it had run aground in the sound Magerøysund in Finnmark. Dronning Maud herself had an accident when she ran aground south of Florø in October 1929.|$|E
25|$|When {{domestic}} air routes {{were established}} in 1935, there only went months from the approval to the services commenced. Permission was granted in April, at which time a suitable site for an aerodrome {{had yet to be}} identified. As an interim solution a buoy was founded for the first season. Norwegian Air Lines set up Tromsø as the last stop on its <b>coastal</b> <b>service</b> north of Bergen. Using a Junkers W 34, the route was inaugurated on 7 July and ran three times weekly for four weeks in the first season. Travel time to Bergen was ten and a half hours.|$|E
25|$|The main {{disadvantages}} of the side-lever engine were {{that it was}} large and heavy, and for inland waterway and <b>coastal</b> <b>service,</b> it was soon replaced by lighter and more efficient designs. It remained the dominant engine type for oceangoing service {{through much of the}} first half of the 19th century however, due to its relatively low centre of gravity which gave ships more stability in heavy seas. It was also a common early engine type for warships, since its relatively low height made it less susceptible to battle damage. From the first Royal Navy steam vessel in 1820 until 1840, 70 steam vessels entered service, the majority with side-lever engines, using boilers set to 4psi maximum pressure. The low steam pressures dictated the large cylinder sizes for the side-lever engines, though the effective pressure on the piston was the difference between the boiler pressure and the vacuum in the condenser.|$|E

25|$|In 1860 the {{government}} decided to subsidize a regularly scheduled steamer service. The first vessel chartered {{to the service}} was the Victoria in 1862. In 1863 Ariel took over, alternating a northern run to Twillingate (later extended to Tilt Cove) with a southern run to LaPoile. In 1871 Grieve and Co. replaced Ariel with Leopard and Tiger, inaugurating northern and southern runs based at St. John's, to Battle Harbour in the north, and to Halifax in the south. After 1877 the two-steamer <b>coastal</b> <b>service</b> continued with Bowring Brothers' Curlew and Plover, while Lady Glover ran in Conception Bay. In 1888 Harvey & Co. took over the service, with Conscript (on the northern service) and Volunteer. The packet Hercules, then later Alert, began running in Placentia Bay, while Favourite ran in Trinity Bay and Lady Glover in Notre Dame Bay. Once the railway reached Harbour Grace {{there was no need}} for a steam-packet on Conception Bay. After Volunteer was lost in 1891, Harvey's commissioned Grand Lake and renamed Conscript the Virginia Lake. Meanwhile, Farquhar's Harlaw served western Newfoundland, out of Halifax.|$|E
