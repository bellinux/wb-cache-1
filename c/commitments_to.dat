40|$|Abstract]: This study aims {{to clarify}} the role of Australian public sector employees' <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> {{organisational}} change. Three components of <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> organisational change (affective, normative, and continuance <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> organisational change) were hypothesised to mediate the relationship between organisational climate and behavioural support for organisational change. Study 1 reports data collected during 2003 from a Queensland government department (N = 342) while Study 2 reports data collected during 2003, from a South Australian government agency (N = 54). Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted with each component of <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> organisational change initially regressed on positive and negative work climate. Subsequently, behavioural support for organisational change was regressed on both <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> organisational change (three components) and organisational climate (two components). In Study 1, {{both positive and negative}} work climate were able to account for significant unique variance in components of <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> organisational change. All three components of <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> organisational change were significant predictors of behavioural support for organisational change. However, in Study 2, only positive work climate was found to significantly predict both affective and continuance <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> organisational change components, while only affective and normative <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> organisational change significantly predicted behavioural support for organisational change. ...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{interesting}} debate in organizational behavior literature on whether conflict or compatibility characterizes the relationship between employees’ <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the organization and their <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the profession.

Significant relationship exist between <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> profession and the affective, continuance, and normative dimensions of <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the organization (coefficients of 0. 43, 0. 15, and 0. 52 respectively). In other words, the results suggest that <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> organization is compatible with <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> profession.

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to solve a paradox: {{maintaining}} {{a high level of}} employees' affective <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the organisation is assumed to be a critical factor for successful downsizing, but downsizing tends to reduce employees' affective <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the organisation. In seeking to resolve this paradox, the thesis aims to provide insights into how employees' affective <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the organisation under downsizing can be managed. The thesis first explores the mechanism through which downsizing exerts its influence on employees' affective <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the organisation, i. e. it examines whether downsizing affects employees' affective <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the organisation directly and/or indirectly through employees' daily work experiences, and seeks to determine which impact is stronger. Then, it examines whether employees' affective <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the organisation is really important in terms of organisational citizenship behaviour. Finally, the thesis identifies the determinants of employees' affective <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the organisation and investigates how and why these determinants have such effects. The results of the research show that the indirect impact of downsizing on employees' affective <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the organisation is much stronger than its direct impact. That is, employees' affective <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the organisation is slightly reduced by downsizing, but it can be maintained or enhanced if the change of employees' daily work experiences caused by downsizing is favourable to them. Moreover, employees' affective <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the organisation appears to be very important in terms of organisational citizenship behaviour. Finally, employees' daily work experiences affect employees' affective <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the organisation through their impacts on the three mediating variables (organisation-based self-esteem, perceived organisational support, and self efficacy). The results also show that organisation-based self-esteem is the key mediating variable...|$|R

The three components of Herscovitch and Meyer's (2002) <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> organisational change model were hypothesised to mediate the relationship between organisational climate and behavioural support for organisational change. Data were collected from a Queensland government department (N = 342). Analysis of correlations revealed that organisational climate, <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> change, and behavioural support for change variables were all significantly related. Structural equation modelling demonstrated that affective, normative, and continuance <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> change were all predictors of behavioural support for organisational change. Positive work climate also contributed directly {{to the prediction of}} behavioural support for change over and above the indirect influence through <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> organisational change, indicating a partial mediation effect. These findings support Herscovitch and Meyer's (2002) three-component model of <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> organisational change and extend their nomological network by showing the relevance of two types of organisational climate to the core components of the model. Affective <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> organisational change is a positive influence on employees' behavioural support for change and also reflects healthy aspects of the organisational climate. However, continuance <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> organisational change is detrimental influence on employees' behavioural support for change and is linked with unhealthy dimensions of the organisational climate...|$|R
40|$|Aim The {{purpose of}} this study was to test a {{theoretical}} model linking the impact of expectations on <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> change and to explore whether change-related communication is a mediating variable between leader–member exchange and expectations. Background Expectations for change outcomes are an important condition <b>to</b> increase nurses' <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> change. To understand the role of leadership and communication in expectations development is crucial <b>to</b> promote <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> change. Method A predictive, non-experimental design was used in a random sample of 395 nurses. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the hypothesized model. Results Positive expectations had a direct effect on affective <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> change, whereas negative expectation had a direct effect on continuance <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> change. Leader–member exchange and communication influenced nurse's expectations about change. Communication partially mediated the relationship between Leader–member exchange and expectations. Conclusion These findings suggested that nurses. expectation about change were strongly linked <b>to</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> change. Furthermore, the enhancement of communication and relationship with leader contributed to the development of positive and negative expectations.
