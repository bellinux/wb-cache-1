40|$|International audienceThe impact <b>of</b> <b>Argo</b> on ECMWF {{operational}} ocean analyses {{has been}} assessed by conducting {{a set of}} observing system experiments spanning the period 2001 - 2006. The experiments evaluate the information content <b>of</b> <b>Argo</b> temperature and salinity data, gauged in terms of influence on the ocean state and the skill of seasonal forecasts. The salinity data from Argo is instrumental in correcting the salinity of the ECMWF analysis on a basin-wide scale. The effect <b>of</b> <b>Argo</b> temperature is noticeable in the Indian, Atlantic and Southern Oceans. In the Pacific, the impact is modest, being confined to the South American coast. The information content <b>of</b> <b>Argo</b> combines well with the altimeter information in most regions. The impact <b>of</b> <b>Argo</b> on seasonal forecasts of sea surface temperature has been assessed for the period 2001 - 2006. The assimilation <b>of</b> <b>Argo</b> improves seasonal forecast skill in most areas, although {{the reduction of the}} error is small...|$|R

The {{constellation}} <b>of</b> <b>Argo</b> was introduced in ancient Greece. However, Nicolas Louis de Lacaille divided Argo into three sections in 1763, including Carina the Keel. In the 19th century, these three became established as separate constellations, and were formally included {{in the list of}} 88 modern IAU constellations in 1930. Lacaille kept a single set of Bayer designations for the whole <b>of</b> <b>Argo.</b> Therefore, Carina has the α, β and ε, Vela has γ and δ, Puppis has ζ, and so on.|$|R

40|$|International audienceArgo is {{a global}} array of {{profiling}} floats that provides temperature (T) and salinity (S) profiles from 2000 m to the surface every ten days with a nominal spatial resolution of 3 °. Here we present idealized experiments where the adjoint method is used to synthesize simulated sets <b>of</b> <b>Argo</b> profiles with a general circulation model, over a one-year period, in the North Atlantic. Using a number of drifting profilers consistent with Argo deployment objectives, the simulated array permits one to identify large-scale anomalies in the hydrography and circulation, {{despite the presence of}} a simulated eddy noise of large amplitude. Model dynamics provide an objective means to distinguish eddy noise from large-scale oceanic variability, and to infer the absolute velocity field (including abyssal velocities and sea surface height) from sets <b>of</b> <b>Argo</b> profiles <b>of</b> T and S. In particular, our idealized experiments suggest that volume and heat transports can be efficiently constrained by sets <b>of</b> <b>Argo</b> profiles. Increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>Argo</b> floats seems to be an adequate strategy to further reduce errors in circulation estimates...|$|R
2500|$|The {{constellation}} Pyxis (the mariner's compass) occupies an {{area which}} in antiquity was considered part <b>of</b> <b>Argo's</b> mast. Some authors state that Pyxis {{was part of}} the Greek conception <b>of</b> <b>Argo</b> Navis, but magnetic compasses were unknown in ancient Greek times. Lacaille considered it a separate constellation, representing one of the modern scientific instruments he placed among the constellations (like Microscopium and Telescopium). Pyxis was listed separately, among his 14 new constellations. Lacaille assigned Bayer designations to Pyxis separate from those <b>of</b> <b>Argo,</b> and his illustration shows an isolated instrument not related to the figure of the ship. [...] In 1844, John Herschel suggested formalizing the mast as a new constellation, Malus, to replace Lacaille's Pyxis, but the idea did not catch on.|$|R
