50|$|The envaulting {{technology}} is a next-generation encryption method, that provides standards based <b>cryptographic</b> <b>protection,</b> integrity protection, real-time remote management and auditing for data. Secret key management in envaulting is fully centralized and automatic, so a legitimate end-user does not need passwords for accessing envaulted data. Envault's first product utilizing the method, Envault Removable Media Protection (formerly USB Storage Protection) has been reviewed by analysts with excellent score.|$|E
50|$|The risk of {{interception}} of passwords {{sent over}} the Internet {{can be reduced}} by, among other approaches, using <b>cryptographic</b> <b>protection.</b> The most widely used is the Transport Layer Security (TLS, previously called SSL) feature built into most current Internet browsers. Most browsers alert the user of a TLS/SSL protected exchange with a server by displaying a closed lock icon, or some other sign, when TLS is in use. There are several other techniques in use; see cryptography.|$|E

Although it uses cryptographic techniques to generate the cookie, TFO {{is not intended to}} provide more security than the three-way handshake it replaces, and does not give any form of <b>cryptographic</b> <b>protection</b> to the resulting TCP connection, or provide identity assurance about either endpoint.

40|$|Abstract. Demands for lawful {{access to}} {{encrypted}} data {{are a long}} standing obstacle to integrating <b>cryptographic</b> <b>protections</b> into communication systems. A common approach is to allow a trusted third party (TTP) {{to gain access to}} private data. However, {{there is no way to}} verify that this trust is well place as the TTP may open all messages indiscriminately. Moreover, existing approaches do not scale well when, in addition to the content of the conversation, one wishes to hide ones identity. Given the importance of metadata this is a major problem. We propose a new signature scheme as an accountable replacement for group signatures, accountable forward and backward tracing signatures...|$|R
50|$|The {{security}} system in Kazakhstan {{is complex and}} multilayered. The Inter-Departmental Commission is charged with coordinating and developing the national information infrastructure. The National Security Committee (NSC) monitors presidential, government, and military communications. The Office of the Prime Minister is an authorized state body responsible {{for the protection of}} state secrets and maintenance of information security. Broadly defined, a ‘‘state secret’’ encompasses various government policies as well as information about the president’s private life, health, and financial affairs. The NSC has issued a general license to the private Agency on Information Security to establish and organize facilities for <b>cryptographic</b> <b>protection</b> of information, as well as to formulate proposals on information security to state organizations, corporate clients, banks, and other large commercial companies. The Kazakh Ministry of Internal Affairs operates Department ‘‘K’’, which bears the functions of its counterpart in the Russian Federation. This department is tasked with investigating and prosecuting cyber crime and cyber attacks. At present, ISPs are required to prohibit their customers from disseminating pornographic, extremist, or terrorist materials or any other information that is not in accordance with the country’s laws. Kazakh officials are also considering additional laws to further regulate the Kazakh Internet. One draft law presently under consideration envisions liability for owners of Web sites hosting weblogs and forums, as well as users of chat rooms. The draft law equates Internet sites to media outlets and applies similar regulations with respect to content. The authors of the law justified tighter oversight by the need to fight cyber crime and provide greater accountability for Internet users.|$|E

This requirement can in practice impose a high bar on making effective use of the <b>cryptographic</b> <b>protections,</b> because securing the coupling between credentials and actual identity can prove to be an arduous process. We frame a more relaxed form of identity, termed opportunistic personas, that works by (i) generating cryptographic credentials on an as-needed basis, (ii) associating credentials not with a user per se but instead as a link to past behavior by the same actor, {{as a means to}} inform future interactions, and (iii) managing these credentials implicitly in an opportunistic fashion. Using three realworld examples, we illustrate the benefits this unorthodox approach to identity management can yield. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{multitude}} of privacy breaches, both accidental and malicious, have prompted users to distrust centralized providers of online social networks (OSNs) and investigate decentralized solutions. We examine {{the design of}} a fully decentralized (peer-to-peer) OSN, with a special focus on privacy and security.

We propose DECENT, an architecture for OSNs that uses a distributed hash table to store user data, and features <b>cryptographic</b> <b>protections</b> for confidentiality and integrity, as well as support for flexible attribute policies and fast revocation. DECENT ensures that neither data nor social relationships are visible to unauthorized users and provides availability through replication and authentication of updates.
