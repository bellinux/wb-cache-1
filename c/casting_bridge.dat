40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to {{investigate}} the fitting accuracy of Co-Cr dental bridges, manufactured by three technologies, with the newly developed method using CAD software. The four-part dental bridges of Co-Cr alloys were produced by conventional casting of wax models, casting with 3 D printed patterns and selective laser melting. The marginal and internal fit of dental bridges was studied out by two methods – silicone replica test and CAD software. As the silicone replica test characterizes with comparatively low accuracy, a new methodology for investigating the fitting accuracy of dental bridges was developed based on the SolidWorks CAD software. The newly developed method allows {{the study of the}} marginal and internal adaptation in unlimited directions and high accuracy. Investigation the marginal fit and internal adaptation of Co-Cr four-part dental bridges by the two methods show that the technological process strongly influences the fitting accuracy of dental restorations. The fitting accuracy of the <b>bridges,</b> <b>cast</b> with 3 D printed patterns, is the highest, followed by the SLM and conventionally <b>cast</b> <b>bridges.</b> The marginal fit of the three groups of bridges is in the clinically acceptable range. The internal gap values vary in different regions – it is highest on the occlusal surfaces, followed by that in the marginal and axial areas. The higher fitting accuracy of the <b>bridges,</b> manufactured by <b>casting</b> with 3 D printed patterns and SLM, compared to the conventionally <b>cast</b> <b>bridges</b> is a good precondition for their successful implementation in the dental offices and laboratories...|$|R
