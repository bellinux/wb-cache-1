This was followed by hot dip galvanising treatment at 450 °C to capture the growth kinetics of the zinc coating (the time of the treatment ranged from 60 to 600 seconds). Nonlinear estimation of the determined growth kinetics of the alloyed layer of a zinc coating was made and an equation of the zinc coating growth was derived.

In the case of L. rhamnosus the rate of this decline was significantly faster in free form in comparison with single (P =  0. 002) and double coated (P <  0.001) form and double coated bacteria were more resistant than single <b>coated</b> <b>form</b> (P =  0. 001). The differences between single and double coated was not statistically significant in L. acidophilus (P =  0.127), but the rate of decline in bacterial count in free form was significantly higher than single coated (P =  0.002) and double coated bacteria (P =  0.001). In conclusion, microencapsulation with alginate-chitosan-Eu S 100 nanoparticles is a novel and efficient method for better viability of L. acidophilus and L. rhamnosus bacteria.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent, researchers have followed different activation methods and they usually used the Langmuir isotherm to indicate {{the effectiveness of the}} activation process. Activation methods involve physical activation such as carbonization of material and chemical activation such as using chemical activating agents (Salleh et al. 2011). Abdelwahab et al. (2005) treated rice husk with citric acid for treating synthetic Direct F. Scarlet (Direct Red 23) containing industrial wastewater. The authors reported that the activated rice husk possesses the highest sorption capacity, especially for 2.5 and 5  g L− 1 of sorbent. The removal curves are single, smooth and continuous leading to saturation. Activated rice husk is observed to have higher adsorption capacity than the untreated rice husk in the removal of Direct Red- 23. Formaldehyde-treated sawdust was used by Bello et al. (2010) for removing Methylene blue from aqueous solution. Garg et al. (2004) treated Prosopis cineraria tree saw dust with formaldehyde and sulphuric acid for removing Malachite green. The authors reported that the optimum pH for dye removal by formaldehyde-treated Prosopis cineraria sawdust and sulphuric acid-treated Prosopis cineraria sawdust was 6 – 10. Higher dye removal by sulphuric acid-treated Prosopis cineraria sawdust and formaldehyde-treated Prosopis cineraria sawdust was possible provided the initial dye concentration was low in solution. The adsorption capacity of formaldehyde-treated Prosopis cineraria sawdust is less than that of sulphuric acid-treated P. cineraria sawdust. Low and Lee (1990) treated coconut husk with a mixture of formaldehyde/HCl for removing Methylene blue from aqueous solution. Sharma and Uma (2010) prepared activated carbon by pyrolyzing rice husk, in the presence of ZnCl 2. They reported that the activated carbon displayed both microporous and mesoporous nature with a significant surface area of 180.50  m 2  g− 1. Water hyacinth roots were treated with 2  N HCl by Rajamohan (2009) for removing Congo red. Kumar and Ahmad (2011) TGW with H 2 SO 4 and ZnCl 2 for removing crystal violet from aqueous solution.

40|$|The {{proteolytic}} {{processing of}} laminin- 5 at the short {{arm of the}} γ 2 chain (γ 2 sa) is known to convert this laminin from a cell adhesion type to a motility type. Here, we studied this mechanism by analyzing the functions of γ 2 sa. In some immortalized or tumorigenic human cell lines, a recombinant γ 2 sa, in either soluble or insoluble (<b>coated)</b> <b>form,</b> promoted the adhesion of these cells to the processed laminin- 5 (Pr-LN 5), and it suppressed their migration stimulated by serum or epidermal growth factor (EGF). γ 2 sa also suppressed EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of integrin β 4 and resultant disruption of hemidesmosome-like structures in keratinocytes. γ 2 sa bound to syndecan- 1, and this binding, {{as well as its}} cell adhesion activity, was blocked by heparin. By analyzing the activities of three different γ 2 sa fragments, the active site of γ 2 sa was localized to the NH 2 -terminal EGF-like sequence (domain V or LEa). Suppression of syndecan- 1 expression by the RNA interference effectively blocked the activities of domain V capable of promoting cell adhesion and inhibiting the integrin β 4 phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that domain V of the γ 2 chain negatively regulates the integrin β 4 phosphorylation, probably through a syndecan- 1 –mediated signaling, leading to enhanced cell adhesion and suppressed cell motility...|$|E

Titanium(IV) -n-propoxide was uncatalyst hydrolyzed with dierent amounts of water at room temperature and was found to react in a 1 : 1. 6 ratio (mole of Ti:mole of H 2 O). It was found that the condensation following the hydrolysis reaction was alcohol condensation. The hydrolysis-condensation product was characterized in detail by GC, Karl-Fischer coulometric titrator, NIR-spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, TG-DTA and elemental analysis. The hydrolysis-condensation product of titanium(IV) -n-propoxide was calcinated at 900 C after drying at 100 C and some of this product was coated with hydrolyzed NH 2 -functional silanes [3 -(2 -aminoethylamino) ethylamino) propyl-trimethoxy silane] (Amino- 1), and [3 -(2 -aminoethylamino) propylmethyldimetoxysilane] (Amino- 2), separately. Adsorption capaci-ties of uncoated and NH 2 -functional silane coated hydrolysis-condensation products for Fe 3 +, Cu 2 + and Pb 2 + ions in aqueous solution were investigated by FAAS.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the nature of Supercell coating, an on-line tablet coater that employed a unique pattern of airflow. Tablets coated at different spray rates (4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mL/min) were analyzed to investigate the influence of different wetting conditions on the quality of <b>coats</b> <b>formed.</b> Scanning electron micrographs showed that tablet <b>coats</b> <b>formed</b> at a spray rate of 4 mL/min consisted of spray-dried droplets that did not coalesce. At a spray rate of 6 mL/min, surface roughness was found to be lower than at the other spray rates, and the coat appeared smoothest, whereby droplets seemed fused together. At higher spray rates, the droplets appeared as branching arms and scale-like structures. This was attributed to the spread of spray droplets by the processing air and mass transfer of wet coating materials between tablets. Further tests showed that <b>coats</b> <b>formed</b> at higher spray rates had higher drug yield, drug uniformity, color uniformity, and density. However, the variability in coat thickness was increased due to the mass transfer of coats and dissolution of tablet core surfaces by the coating material. Since coats of different characteristics can be <b>formed</b> in Supercell <b>coating,</b> the choice of wetting conditions would depend on the type of coat required and the coating materials used...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A protein {{activity}} {{has been identified}} in extracts of coated vesicles that enables purified clathrin triskelions to reassemble in vitro into coat structures of uniform size. <b>Coats</b> <b>formed</b> {{in the presence of}} this preparation, regardless of the buffer system employed, are uniform in size with a mean diameter of 78 nm (+ 5 nm SD) and a sedimentation coefficient (S 2 o, w) of [...] - 250 S. Analysis of the reassembled coats on dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gels reveals that they have specifically incorporated three polypeptides from the preparation: those of Mr 52, 000, 100, 000, and 110, 000. The 52, 000 -, 100, 000 -, and 110, 000 -mol-wt polypeptides are incorporated in molar ratios of 0. 85, 1. 11, and 0. 26, respectively, per three clathrin monomers (equivalent to one triskelion).

40|$|We {{determined}} {{the effects of}} soluble or coated nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite paste (nano-HA) and enamel matrix derivative (EMD) on proliferation, adhesion, and migration of periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLs). Cultured PDLs were stimulated with nano-HA paste or EMD in a soluble form or were coated {{to the surface of}} cell culture dishes. Proliferation of PDLs on coated nano-HA and EMD was quantified by various methods including bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and Western blot. Cell migration was investigated in a modified Boyden chamber. The surface integrin profile of PDLs was determined using an integrin-specific ELISA, and integrin-specific signaling was measured by immunoblotting of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Coated nano-HA stimulated PDL proliferation to a larger extent as compared with coated EMD. PDL migration towards a nano-HA or EMD gradient was more efficiently mediated by soluble EMD as compared with nano-HA but vice versa, adhesion of PDLs to compound-coated dishes was more effectively mediated by nano-HA as compared with EMD. Mechanistically, majorly integrin alpha 5 beta 1 -mediated adhesion of PDL and both coated compounds mediated a significant increase in FAK activation though to a different extent. Current findings offer two different modes of action for EMD and nano-HA paste. EMD efficiently acts as a chemoattractant in its soluble form, while nano-HA paste effectively serves as a synthetic extracellular matrix component in its <b>coated</b> <b>form.</b> Our findings suggest that EMD and nano-HA paste display different molecular characteristics and apply alternative routes to mediate their beneficial effects on periodontal tissues...|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis describes the use of polystyrene nanoparticles as model surfaces for bioanalytical work. Nanoparticles constitute convenient platforms for the attachment of bioactive agents, and receptor coated particles offer high local concentration of binding sites for specific ligands with minimal steric hindrance. However, {{it is not only}} the amount of bound protein that matters, the proteins must also be immobilized at the surface in such ways that they fully retain their activity, while at the same time protecting the surface from unspecific uptake of undesired components. The present work relates to the controlled immobilization of multiple types of active biomolecules onto nanoparticle surfaces to make them multifunctional. The surface expansion offered by the nanoparticles, in combination with the closeness between the reactants co-immobilized on the same particle, enables coupled reactions to be carried at a higher rate than otherwise possible. Thus, particle-decorated surfaces of this kind are highly suitable for miniaturized bioanalytical systems. Sensitive microarray systems are under development, including lectin-coated nanoparticles for glycoprotein mapping and a diagnostic device for Point-of-Care testing with a nanoparticle-based detection system. The full evaluation of protein attachment to nanoparticles requires precise analytical techniques for particle characterization, both in bare and <b>coated</b> <b>form.</b> The mass-sensitive SdFFF technique occupies a prominent position for particle characterization, as it offers both accurate determination of particle size and a quantification of adsorbed layers on small particles, whether of synthetic or biopolymeric nature. Here, this analytical technique is developed to precisely characterize nanoparticles that are sequentially coated with different layers, each rendering the particles a specific functionality. The thesis demonstrates how precise mass uptakes can be determined for each specific layer, and how control over the exact surface composition of the modified particles can be established for optimization of biological activity...|$|E

40|$|The {{antibacterial}} {{effects of}} medium-chain fatty acids (mcfa) {{are described in}} the literature. In this study, mcfa were fed to weaned piglets as dietary supplement in order to evaluate the effects on intestinal microbiota and immune system. Two different forms of mcfa were compared, free mcfa and coated mcfa. The animals were divided in three treatment groups with 12 animals each. Two experiments were carried out under identical conditions with 6 animals per group. The control group A was provided a standard piglet diet, group B was additionally supplemented with 0. 3 % (w/w) of a commercial product containing the free forms of caprylic and capric acid and flavouring compounds. Group C was offered a supplement of 0. 3 % (w/w) of the coated forms of the acids. After a feeding period of 25 to 27 days, two animals per group were sacrificed. Blood and tissue samples of the mesenterial lymph nodes and small intestine were taken; the digesta of the stomach, of the jejunum, the caecum and the colon were collected. Apparent precaecal digestibility of crude nutrients, change of pH-value and dried matter weight of the digesta were measured. Impact of mcfa on the gut flora was determined by viable count of total aerobe, total anaerobe and coliform bacteria in the digesta of distal jejunum and caecum. Bacteria in the stomach digesta were detected by qPCR, thus determining the number of lactic acid bacteria, eubacteria and Escherichia spp [...] The digesta samples were also tested for a broad variety of bacterial metabolities such as scfa, lactate and ammonium. The potential of immunomodulation of mcfa was evaluated by considering different parameters, as there are: determination of phagocytic activity of isolated blood-neutrophils by Phagotest®, flow cytometric measuring of the relative proportion of CD 4 -CD 8 +-, CD 4 +CD 8 [...] , CD 4 +CD 8 +- lymphocytes and MHC-CD 21 +-, MHC+CD 21 [...] , MHC+CD 21 +-cells in the blood and in the mesenterial lymph nodes, and proliferative activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes after stimulation with Con A and LPS. The ileum tissue samples were tested for possible changes in cytokine mRNA expression of MIP 1 beta, IL 1 beta, IFN gamma, TNF alpha and MCP 1 by qPCR. Health status and weight gain of the piglets were not affected. A slight increase of apparent precaecal digestibility of crude protein from 63, 9 (± 5, 33) % {{in the control group}} to 72, 1 (± 8, 85) % was observed in group C. A significantly higher concentration of mcfa was detected in the stomach samples of both experimental groups. The concentrations dropped rapidly to a non-active level during the passage through the digestive tract. The free form and the <b>coated</b> <b>form</b> of mcfa showed no difference. The determination of bacteria by cultural analysis revealed a significant increase of coliform bacteria in the distal jejunum of the experimental groups (p ≤ 0, 05). In this intestinal segment also the ammonium concentration was found to be significantly increased (p ≤ 0, 05). There have been no difference in lactate and short-chain fatty acid concentrations among the groups. The average counts for eubacteria and Escherichia ssp. were determined by qPCR in the stomach digesta and found to be increased in the group supplemented with the coated product (p ≤ 0, 05 and p ≤ 0, 01, respectively). Immunological parameters were not changed due to the application of mcfa. Within this trial, both mcfa-containing products could not effect the microbiota and the bacterial metabolities in the gastrointestinal tract. Coating of mcfa could not prevent their fast absorption during the gastrointestinal passage. Probably the concentrations used in this study were to low and out of the effective range. Secondly, the pH-value of the stomach might have a negative influence on the mcfa-derived effects. For further studies, an increase of dietary mcfa-concentrations, probably in combination with an organic acid, would be indicated to get more pronounced positive effects...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Aspirin is {{recommended}} in secondary prevention (SP) in diabetes and macrovascular disease. Recommendation in primary prevention (PP) remains controversial {{as does the}} dose of aspirin prescribed. To ascertain whether these controversies are reflected in clinical practice, we conducted a survey of healthcare professionals' views on aspirin prescribing in diabetes. Methods: An anonymous online survey consisting of 26 questions (Likert scale) covering demographic characteristics and aspirin prescribing habits in primary prevention and secondary prevention was circulated via email. Results: 152 people responded with variable response rates: Primary care (96 / 152, 63 %) - mixture of doctors/Diabetes Specialist Nurses; Secondary care were predominantly diabetes specialists (56 / 152, 37 %). Primary prevention (PP) : 39 / 103 (37 %) did not routinely prescribe aspirin whilst 16 / 121 (13. 2 %) would consider using aspirin in all diabetes patients as primary prevention. Using Chi-square contingency tables showed that there were differences when prescribing aspirin with regards to hypertension as a risk factor in primary prevention between primary care (20 / 68 [29. 4 %] opting for aspirin) and secondary care (24 / 49 [48. 98 %], p-value- 0. 03) and doctors and nurses (38 / 60 vs 16 / 58, p= 0. 0009) and also with microalbuminuria - primary care vs secondary care (15 / 67 vs 21 / 48, p= 0. 015), and doctors versus nurses (26 / 60 vs 11 / 59, p= 0. 004). Nurses {{were less likely to}} prescribe aspirin as primary prevention in smokers (11 / 57 [19. 2 %] vs 22 / 60 [36 %]; OR- 0. 41 [0. 16 - 1. 03], p= 0. 042). Secondary prevention (SP) : Despite no contraindications 8 / 125 (6. 4 %) would not give aspirin. 75 mg/day or 300 mg/day preferred doses in various settings. There were no statistically significant differences between primary and secondary care (62 / 73 vs 47 / 52 or 84. 9 % vs 90. 4 %, p= 0. 36) but doctors prescribed aspirin more often compared to nurses (59 / 67 vs 51 / 85 or 60 % vs 88. 1 %, p= 0. 006). In patients with history of peptic ulceration respondents recommended a) use of PPI cover in PP- 37 / 103 (35. 9 %) and SP- 60 / 103 (58. 3 %), b) enteric coated aspirin PP- 13 / 103 (12. 6 %) and SP- 11 / 103 (10. 7 %), c) not use any anti-platelet agents in PP- 53 / 103 (51. 5 %) and SP- 8 / 103 (7. 8 %). Enteric coated aspirin recommended by respondents as follows: Always- 8 / 109 (7. 3 %), sometimes- 16. 5 %, occasionally- 37. 6 %, and never- 35. 8 %. 89 / 103 (86. 5 %) had stated their patients had raised issues with them regards aspirin use. 27 / 103 (26. 2 %) would definitely take aspirin themselves if they had diabetes. The differences were not significant either in a primary prevention setting or a secondary prevention setting when primary care was compared to secondary care but doctors were more likely to prescribe aspirin with PPI cover or in the enteric <b>coated</b> <b>form</b> compared to nurses (48 / 57 [84. 2 %] vs 23 / 46 [50 %]; OR= 0. 188 (0. 067 - 0. 511), p 0. 05, sVCAM- 1 > 0. 05), fasting glucose, BMI, blood pressure, or lipid parameters. Multiple regression analyses showed a good correspondence between the metabolic factors at baseline but were not repeated with different doses as {{there were no significant differences}} demonstrated with any of the parameters. Conclusions: Aspirin at the doses studied and over the 2 week duration caused no significant changes in any of the markers studied. Good metabolic control (blood pressure, glycaemia, lipids), and widespread use of statins may be responsible for the lack of effect demonstrated.

A thermal barrier coating is used to reduce {{the temperature of the}} base superalloy, and a bondcoat is deposited between the base material and the thermal barrier coating. The bondcoat improves the oxidation and corrosion resistance of the base superalloy and improves the spallation resistance of the thermal barrier coating. A commercial platinum aluminide bondcoat was applied to the HSR-developed alloys, and a diffusion zone developed as a result of interaction between the bondcoat and the superalloy. Optimized strength is obtained for superalloys when the refractory element content is high and the limits of microstructural stability are approached or exceeded slightly. For fourthgeneration alloys, instability leads to the formation of topologically close packed (TCP) phases, which form internally in the superalloy, and a secondary reaction zone (SRZ), which forms under the diffusion zone. There was a concern that excessive quantities of either TCP or SRZ might decrease the mechanical properties of the superalloy, with SRZ thought to be particularly detrimental and its formation unpredictable. Thus, an SRZreduction effort was initiated in the NASA UEET Program so that methods developed during the HSR project could be optimized further to reduce or eliminate the SRZ. An SRZ is a three-phase constituent composed of TCP and stringers of gamma phase in a matrix of gamma prime. An incoherent grain boundary separates the SRZ from the gammagamma prime microstructure of the superalloy. The SRZ is believed to form as a result of local chemistry changes in the superalloy due to the application of the diffusion aluminide bondcoat. Locally high surface stresses also appear to promote the formation of the SRZ. Thus, techniques that change the local alloy chemistry or reduce surface stresses have been examined for their effectiveness in reducing SRZ. These SRZ-reduction steps are performed on the test specimen or the turbine blade before the bondcoat is applied. Stressrelief heat treatments developed at NASA Glenn have been demonstrated to reduce significantly the amount of SRZ that develops during subsequent high-temperature exposures. Stress-relief heat treatments reduce surface stresses by recrystallizing a thin surface layer of the superalloy. However, in alloys with very high propensities to form SRZ, stress relief heat treatments alone do not eliminate SRZ entirely. Thus, techniques that modify the local chemistry under the bondcoat have been emphasized and optimized successfully at Glenn. One such technique is carburization, which changes the local chemistry by forming submicron carbides near the surface of the superalloy. Detailed characterizations have demonstrated that the depth and uniform distribution of these carbides are enhanced when a stress relief treatment and an appropriate surface preparation are employed in advance of the carburization treatment. Even in alloys that have the propensity to develop a continuous SRZ layer beneath the diffusion zone, the SRZ has been completely eliminated or reduced to low, manageable levels when this combination of techniques is utilized. Now that the techniques to mitigate SRZ have been established at Glenn, TCP phase formation is being emphasized in ongoing work under the UEET Program. The limitsf stability of the fourth-generation alloys with respect to TCP phase formation are currently being defined along with high-temperature creep rupture properties. In addition, a regression model is being developed at Glenn for the prediction of the presence of TCP phase in the microstructure and SRZ under the diffusion zone. The model is based on a design-of-experiments methodology with emphasis on the potential synergistic effects of alloying elements...|$|E
