50|$|Depending on {{the form}} into which the mixture is pressed, adobe can {{encompass}} nearly any shape or size, provided drying is even and the mixture includes reinforcement for larger bricks. Reinforcement can include manure, straw, cement, rebar or wooden posts. Experience has shown straw, cement, or manure added to a standard adobe mixture can all produce a stronger, more <b>crack-resistant</b> brick. A test is done on the soil content first. To do so, {{a sample of the}} soil is mixed into a clear container with some water, creating an almost completely saturated liquid. The container is shaken vigorously for one minute. It is then allowed to settle for a day until the soil has settled into layers. Heavier particles settle out first, sand above, silt above that and very fine clay and organic matter will stay in suspension for days. After the water has cleared, percentages of the various particles can be determined. Fifty to 60 percent sand and 35 to 40 percent clay will yield strong bricks. The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service at New Mexico State University recommends a mix of not more than 1/3 clay, not less than 1/2 sand, and never more than 1/3 silt.|$|E
40|$|The {{superimposed}} {{layers of the}} true oyster shell have distinct morphology. The shells are mainly calcitic, comprising an outer prismatic region and inner foliated structure that is frequently interrupted by lenses of chalky calcitic deposits. Aragonite is restricted to the myostracum and ligament. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis has shown that despite the variations in structural morphology, the mineralized layers of the oyster shell maintain a single crystallographic orientation with the crystallographic c-axis orientated perpendicular to outer and inner shell surfaces. Varying crystal morphology, while maintaining crystallographic unity, may be an evolutionary trait that forms a <b>crack-resistant</b> shell with optimum strength and flexibility. © 2009 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the fracture toughness of the innovative structural material - Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC), evaluated by flexural performance. For determination the material behaviour by static loading are used adapted standard test methods for flexural performance of fiber-reinforced concrete (ASTM C 1609 and ASTM C 1018). Fracture toughness is estimated by various deformation parameters {{derived from the}} load-deflection curve, obtained by testing simple supported beam under third-point loading, using servo-controlled testing system. This method is used to be estimated {{the contribution of the}} embedded fiber-reinforcement into improvement of the fractural behaviour of UHPC by changing the <b>crack-resistant</b> capacity, fracture toughness and energy absorption capacity with various mechanisms. The position of the first crack has been formulated based on P-δ (load- deflection) response and P-ε (load - longitudinal deformation in the tensile zone) response, which are used for calculation of the two toughness indices I 5 and I 10. The combination of steel fibres with different dimensions leads to a composite, having at the same time increased crack resistance, first crack formation, ductility and post-peak residual strength...|$|E

In this paper, bone-like composite materials were modeled by using circular inclusions as osteons and their cement lines. A two-inclusion model was investigated to see how crack location and inclusion size and property variations affect the propagation of an initial crack between the inclusions. A four-inclusion model was studied to determine conditions for attracting cracks to inclusions for arrestment. The four-inclusion model was optimized in order to arrest any crack initiated within the interstitial material between the inclusions. The optimized model was verified with the FRANC 2 D software. The results showed that inclusions with effective elastic moduli smaller {{than that of the}} interstitial material always tend to attract cracks. On the contrary, an inclusion with effective modulus greater than that of the interstitial material has a tendency to repel cracks. A crack’s propagation direction can be changed by varying inclusions’ sizes and elastic properties. At optimal point, any crack initiated within the interstitial material between the four inclusions can be attracted to two inclusions for arrestment...|$|E

40|$|Fiber-reinforced {{concrete}} {{represents the}} current tendency to apply more efficient <b>crack-resistant</b> concrete. For instance, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a polyester polymer obtained from recyclable bottles; {{it has been}} widely used to produce fibers to obtain cement-based products with improved properties. Therefore, this paper reports on an experimental study of recycled-bottle-PET fiber-reinforced concrete. Fibers with lengths of 10, 15 and 20 mm and volume fractions of 0. 05, 0. 18 and 0. 30 % related to {{the volume of the}} concrete were used. Physical and mechanical characterization of the concrete was performed, including the determination of compressive strength, flexural strength, Young’s modulus and fracture toughness as well as analysis using mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Flexure and impact tests were performed after 28 and 150 days. No significant effect of the fiber addition on the compressive strength and modulus of elasticity was observed. However, the Young’s modulus was observed to decrease as the fiber volume increased. At 28 days, the concrete flexural toughness and impact resistance increased with the presence of PET fibers, except for the 0. 05 vol. % sample. However, at 150 days, this improvement was no longer present due to recycled-bottle-PET fiber degradation in the alkaline concrete environment, as visualized by SEM observations. An increase in porosity also has occurred at 365 days for the fiber-reinforced concrete, as determined by MIP...|$|E
40|$|NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has {{developed}} a technology that combines a film/adhesive laydown module with fiber placement technology to enable the processing of composite prepreg tow/tape and films, foils or adhesives on the same placement machine. The development of this technology grew out of NASA's need for lightweight, permeation-resistant cryogenic propellant tanks. Autoclave processing of high performance composites results in thermally-induced stresses {{due to differences in}} the coefficients of thermal expansion of the fiber and matrix resin components. These stresses, together with the reduction in temperature due to cryogen storage, tend to initiate microcracking within the composite tank wall. One way in which to mitigate this problem is to introduce a thin, <b>crack-resistant</b> polymer film or foil into the tank wall. Investigation into methods to automate the processing of thin film or foil materials into composites {{led to the development of}} this technology. The concept employs an automated film supply and feed module that may be designed to fit existing fiber placement machines, or may be designed as integral equipment to new machines. This patent-pending technology can be designed such that both film and foil materials may be processed simultaneously, leading to a decrease in part build cycle time. The module may be designed having a compaction device independent of the host machine, or may utilize the host machine's compactor. The film module functions are controlled by a dedicated system independent of the fiber placement machine controls. The film, foil, or adhesive is processed via pre-existing placement machine run programs, further reducing operational expense...|$|E
40|$|Bone has {{a complex}} {{hierarchical}} microstructure that spans from the nanoscale of the collagen molecules to the macroscopic physiological scale. In {{order to assess}} bone's risk of fracture with issues such as aging, disease, or irradiation {{it is critical to}} have a clear mechanistic framework which analyzes bone's deformation and fracture behavior at each structurally significant length scale. In this context, this present study seeks to characterize the fracture properties of bone by applying a hierarchical approach. Accordingly, this study utilizes x-ray microtomography from synchrotron radiation in order to identify the <b>crack-resistant</b> extrinsic mechanisms in different types of cortical bone. It was found that bone, which is a highly anisotropic material, displays toughening through crack deflection, out of plane twist and crack bridging. Next this study utilizes in situ tensile tests with x-ray scattering to investigate the submicron deformation in bone; at this length scale bone toughens intrinsically through plasticity mechanisms such as fibrillar sliding. Lastly, this study uses this mechanistic framework to evaluate the effects of irradiation on the fracture properties of bone. Here it was found that bone exposed to high doses of irradiation, greater than 70 kGy (Gy=J/Kg), leads to a severe progressive dose dependent degradation in strength, ductility, and toughness which is attributed to a change in the crack path (extrinsic effect) and a degradation of the collagen integrity from altered collagen cross-link (intrinsic effect). Overall, the goal of this work is to outline a framework that can be applied to future studies investigating the effects of disease and aging on bone...|$|E
40|$|The ongoing {{development}} of environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) offers the prospect {{to implement the}} full potential of silicon-based ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) for high temperature structural applications, more specifically the hot zones of gas turbine engines. The current state-of-the-art EBC system comprises a Si bond coat, a mullite (Al 6 Si 2 O 13) interlayer and a barium-strontium aluminosilicate (BSAS) (Ba 1 -xSrxAl 2 Si 2 O 8; 0 <x< 1) <b>crack-resistant</b> and water vapor attack resistant top coat. In this study, fully crystalline air plasma sprayed Si/mullite/BSAS-celsian EBCs were engineered under controlled conditions on SiC substrates. The influence of water vapor corrosion on the structural and mechanical properties of a Si/Mullite/BSAS EBC architecture was assessed by furnace thermal cycle testing (i. e.; 50 and 100 cycles, 2 h/cycles at 13000 C in water vapor atmosphere). The elastic modulus values of the as-sprayed BSAS top coat (7516 GPa as determined via indentation) did not exhibit major changes after thermal exposure (7818 GPa). In addition, the BSAS layer exhibited crack healing at high temperatures, the density of cracks decreasing from 15 cracks/cm in the as-sprayed state to 2 cracks/cm after thermal cycling. These characteristics of the BSAS top coat were related to its glass-ceramic nature, the phase/chemical stabilities of the BSAS-celsian at high temperatures and the engineered deposition conditions at which it was deposited. The overall performance at high-temperature of this functionally graded EBC architecture is discussed and correlated to its microstructural characteristics. 9 2012.

30|$|Quality of life implicates proper {{nutrition}} presuming long-term oral health, {{which is}} associated with the number of teeth in the dentition [1]. Elderly patients with more than 20 remaining teeth experience a superior subjective physical health score to those with less than 20 teeth [2]. In highly developed mammals, teeth are a limiting life factor, as they are necessary for nutrition. Teeth are subject to high wear and mechanical loads resulting from biting forces of approximately 500  N and biting pressures of up to 34  MPa [3] for decades. Unlike other hard tissues, e.g. bone, remodeling does not occur in human teeth with the exception of relatively minor secondary dentin formation [4]. Human tooth crowns consist of dentin as supporting core, which is composed of highly mineralized peri-tubular dentin surrounded by less mineralized inter-tubular dentin [5]. The well defined, oriented microtubules of dentin display anisotropy on the micrometer scale. Dentin abuts on dental enamel and acts as energy-absorbing, <b>crack-resistant</b> structure [6]. Much effort has been devoted to understand the detailed composition and the microstructure of tubules [7 – 12], as well as their relationship to fracture toughness [6, 13]. The interface between dentin and enamel, i.e. the dentin–enamel junction (DEJ) [14] is of particular interest. Here, the two hard tissues with very different biomechanical properties are robustly joined. Enamel is hard and brittle, whereas dentin is much tougher and less stiff. The DEJ exhibits remarkable mechanical properties transferring the loads from enamel to dentin [15] and providing a crack-arrest barrier [16]. Pioch et al. [17], for example, measured the shear strength along the DEJ and were unable to detect any fracture along this interface. Cracks initiated in enamel went straight through the DEJ rather than along [18]. Cracks tended to penetrate the (optical) DEJ and arrested in the tough mantle dentin [13], where damage was spread over a broad zone [19]. Gap bridging at the crack tip was reported to be the main crack-arresting mechanism [13]. There is common agreement that the DEJ is not an interface in mathematical sense but rather an extended transition region. Different reports on the DEJ width show variation in intra-tooth location [20 – 23].|$|E
