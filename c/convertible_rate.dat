40|$|We {{investigate}} the long-standing puzzle on the underpricings of convertible bonds. We hypothesize that the observed underpricing is {{induced by the}} possibility that a convertible bond might renegotiate on some of its covenants, e. g., an imbedded put option in financial difficulties. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that the initial underpricing is larger for lower rated bonds. The underpricing worsens if the issuer experiences subsequent financial difficulties. However, conditional on no rating downgrades, our main empirical result shows that convertible bond prices do converge to their theoretical prices within two years.

40|$|The {{success in}} {{marketing}} original issue high-yield bonds has generated significant {{interest in their}} default experience. Studies comparing defaults to the par value of outstanding issues such as Altman (1987), Altman and Nammacher (1985), and Weinstein (1987) have found relatively low default rates. However, these studies understate default rates because of the rapid increase in the par value of outstanding issues and because cumulative default rates increase with years from issuance. Two recent studies by Altman (1989) and Asquith, Mullins and Wolff (AMW) (1989) have corrected these problems by using aging analysis to follow rated nonconvertible high-yield bonds over time; they find cumulative default rates for such bonds 10 years after issuance exceeding 30 percent.; This study extends the literature on high-yield default <b>rates</b> to <b>convertible</b> and nonrated securities, not examined in previous studies. The high-yield market can be partitioned into <b>rated</b> nonconvertible, <b>rated</b> <b>convertible,</b> nonrated nonconvertible, and nonrated convertible securities. Other things equal, one would expect higher default risk {{to be associated with}} higher yields; however, other things are not equal. For example, securities may have high yields because of differences in liquidity or differences in conversion options. Therefore, yields reflect more than just expected default risk; they also incorporate premiums for other characteristics of individual securities.; When the securities are partitioned by rating and convertibility, the results of this paper show that the cumulative default rates are lower for <b>rated</b> <b>convertible</b> securities than for rated nonconvertible securities. Because investors value convertibility, convertible bonds carry substantially lower coupon rates than nonconvertible bonds. These lower coupon rates may reduce the likelihood of an issue defaulting.; In addition, this study examines nonrated securities. Many securities are nonrated because the graduated fee structure charged by rating agencies makes ratings prohibitively expensive for smaller issues. Despite some potential biases that are discussed below, the default <b>rate</b> on nonrated <b>convertible</b> bonds is significantly less than that of rated nonconvertible securities, and the default rate on nonrated nonconvertible bonds appears to be less than that for rated nonconvertible securities.; The next section of the paper discusses the data and shows that the default rates for rated nonconvertible securities are higher than those for <b>rated</b> <b>convertible,</b> nonrated convertible, and nonrated nonconvertible securities. Each category of security is further examined for explanations for lower default rates, in Sections II through IV. Section V estimates a logit model that shows that default differences based on security characteristics persist even after controlling for coupon rates and size. Section VI summarizes the results.

It notes that the system has not facilitated the symmetric and timely adjustment in the real exchange rate necessary to accommodate the integration of China and other emerging-market economies into the global economy. This lack of adjustment contributed to the global financial crisis and recession and, because it is forestalling the required rotation of global demand, is hindering the global recovery. The article then discusses reform of the system that would see all systemically important countries and currency areas adopt market-based and <b>convertible</b> floating exchange <b>rates</b> supported by appropriate monetary, fiscal and financial sector policy frameworks.

Twenty months of data for the seven GPS stations in South Korea were analyzed to estimate velocities relative to Taejon (DAEJ), a central region of South Korea.

The relative velocities within the Korean peninsula are very small (∼ 1 mm/year), <b>convertible</b> to strain <b>rates</b> {{in the order of}} 0.01 ppm/yr.

The second essay considers floating <b>rate</b> <b>convertibles</b> (FRCs). FRCs are a category of PIPE securities that receive negative associations in both the academic and professional literature. This study sheds light on the managerial relationship to the decision to issue FRCs and to the variation in market response to these issues. One main result of the study identifies influence of the CFO relative to the CEO as significant in the decision to issue FRCs and in the market's immediate reaction to the issuance. Another main result is that FRC issuing firms with CFOs without prior public equity issuance experience have significantly negative long run abnormal returns, whereas FRC issuing firms with experienced CFOs do not...|$|R
40|$|The article {{sets forth}} to {{determine}} the impact of inflation and changes in currency exchange rates in capitalism on the international trade. Accordingly, {{in the first part}} of the article the author discusses main sources of inflation, which — in his opinion — include: 1) consumer demand of households in the broad sense of the word, 2) production demand of companies in the field of investments and employment, 3) foreign demand for export commodities, 4) state expenditure on consumption and investments as well as on military and outer space exploration purposes. The second part of the article deals with the problem of import and export of inflation in capitalism. The author points out here that countries playing a smaller role in the international trade are, as a rule, forced to import inflation, as they cannot exert a bigger influence on the level of the world prices for goods exported by them. Next, there are discussed causes of changes in currency exchange <b>rates</b> (<b>convertible</b> currencies) over the period of 1973 — 1976. In the final part of the article, which sums up the main points, the author states that in conditions of inflation there occur changes in directions and structure of the international trade. This concerns both foreign trade streams and industrial co- operation and co-production. The inflation exerts also an influence on capital flows, payments balances, international currency system and East-West economic relations.

40|$|Exchange-rate-based {{stabilization}} {{is designed}} to reduce inflation by using the exchange rate as the main nominal anchor. This {{does not necessarily mean}} a fixed exchange rate. A crawling peg with a low rate of depreciation or a pre-announced gradual reduction in the rate of devaluation are alternative ways to use the exchange rate as a nominal anchor. Exchange-rate-based stabilization (ERBS) has been widely used in the high-inflation economies of Latin America. Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay adopted a pre-announced crawling peg in the late 1970 s (the famous tablitas) to bring down inflation, with mixed results. Israel and Mexico used the exchange rate as a nominal anchor, and inflation came down significantly. More recently, Argentina relied on a fixed and <b>convertible</b> exchange <b>rate</b> (the convertibility plan) to bring to an end four decades of inflation. So far, the outcomes have been good. The authors find that ERBS have generally been more effective than money-based programs in bringing down inflation in the high inflation economies. But when inflation was reduced gradually, the process resulted in continuous (sometimes significant) real appreciation. Even fixing the exchange rate in Chile in 1979 did not reduce the underlying rate of inflation. Argentina's recent convertibility plan has been more successful in bringing inflation down significantly than previous money-based programs (from monthly rates of about 10 percent to just 1. 5 percent in a few months). One could argue that this is a special case, since Argentina was coming from full-blown hyperinflation, so the authors compared the fixed-exchange-rate periods in Argentina and Chile, and came up with useful insights. Argentina's greater success cannot be explained only by fiscal arguments. When Chile fixed its exchange rate in 1979, it wasalready enjoying a budget surplus. Argentina in 1991 was running a small deficit - smaller than in previous years, but a deficit. Perhaps a better explanation is the government's perceived strong commitment to the fixed exchange rate and the potential large costs of reneging on it. The convertibility law made devaluation far more difficult (requiring congressional approval) and reduced the chances of discretionary devaluation. And the government tied its own hands further by legalizing the use of the dollar as a unit of account and means of exchange. The costs of abandoning the fixed exchange rate were also perceived to be greater in Argentina. Devaluation was (and is) perceived as opening the door for renewed hyperinflation, a dreadful scenario. Chile did not face this threat so it was more difficult - and took longer - to convince the public that the government was determined to maintain the parity. Governments tend to stick to the fixed exchange rate longer than is prudent. It is now apparent that some flexibility at an earlier stage would have reduced the costs of the final failure of the tablitas. Why do governments find it so difficult to make exchange-rate policy more flexible? Why do they wait for a balance of payments crisis rather than anticipate it? Perhaps because they fear the public will equate flexibility with failure and a loss of credibility. The authors found, however - in the experience of Israel and Mexico - that inflation does not necessarily go up when the exchange rate is made more flexible. Countries must balance the need to maintain an exchange rate rule (for credibility) with the need to keep external balance.

40|$|This article {{provides}} a survey on term structure models designed for pricing {{fixed income securities}} and their derivatives. 1 The past several decades have witnessed a rapid development in the fixed-income markets. A number of new fixed-income instruments have been introduced successfully into the financial market. These include, to mention just a few, strips, debt warrants, put bonds, commercial mortgage-backed securities, payment-in-kind debentures, zero-coupon <b>convertibles,</b> interest <b>rate</b> futures and options, credit default swaps, and swaptions. The size of the fixed-income market has greatly expanded. The total value of the fixed-income assets is {{about two-thirds of the}} market value of all outstanding securities. 2 From the investment perspective, {{it is important to understand}} how fixed-income securities are priced. The term structure of interest rates plays a key role in pricing fixed income securities. Not surprisingly, a vast literature has been devoted to understanding the stochastic behavior of term structure of interest rate, the pricing mechanism of fixed-income markets, and the spread between different fixed-income securities. Past research generally focuses on: (i) modeling the term structure of interest rates and yield spreads; (ii) providing empirical evidence; and (iii) applying the theory to the pricing of fixed-income instruments and risk management. As such, our review centers on alternative models of term structure of interest rates, their tractability, empirical performance, and applications. We begin with the basic definitions and notations in Section 1. We provide clear concepts of term structure of interest rates that are easily misunderstood. Section 2 introduces bond pricing theory within the dynamic term structure model (DTSM) framework. This framework provides a general modeling structure in which most of the popular term structure models are nested. This discussion thus helps understand the primary ingredients to categorize different DTSMs, i. e., the risk-neutral distribution of the state variables and the mapping function between these state variables and instantaneous interest rate. Sections 3 provides a literature review of the studies on default free bonds. Several widely used continuous-time DTSMs are reviewed here, including affine, quadratic, regime switching, jump-diffusion and stochastic volatility models. We conclude this section with a discussion of empirical performance of these DTSMs, where we discuss some open issues, including the expectation puzzle, the linearity of state variables, the advantages of multifactor and nonlinear models, and their implications for pricing and risk management. The studies of defaultable bonds are explored in section 4. We review both structural and reduced-form models, with particular attention given to the later. Several important issues in reduced form models are addressed here, including the specification of recovery rates, default intensity, coupon payment, other factors such as liquidity and taxes, and correlated defaults. Since it is convenient to have a closed-form pricing formula, it is important to evaluate the tradeoff between analytical tractability and the model complexity. Major empirical issues are related touncovering the components of yield spreads and answering the question whether the factors are latent or observable. Section 5 reviews the studies on two popular interest rate derivatives: interest rate swap and credit default swap. Here we present the pricing formulas of interest rate swap and credit default swap based on risk-neutral pricing theory. Other risk factors, such as counterparty risk and liquidity risk are then introduced into the pricing formula. Following this, we review important empirical work on the determinants of interest rate swap spread and credit default swap spread. Section 6 concludes the paper by providing a summary of the literature and directions for future research. These include: (i) the economic significance of DTSM specification on pricing and risk management; (ii) the difference of interest rate dynamics in the risk neutral measure and physical measure; (iii) the decomposition of yield spreads; and (iv) the pricing of credit risk with correlated factors.
