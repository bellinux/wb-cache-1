30|$|The first {{shortcoming}} of {{the algorithm}} CudaChain is that: {{the efficiency of}} discarding interior points using SPA within a single thread block cannot be guaranteed to be the highest. Probably, to hide memory latency and improve the efficiency, it needs to allocate several <b>thread</b> blocks <b>in</b> the discarding of interior points using the method SPA; and each thread is responsible for checking and discarding interior points for a small subset of consecutive points. However, the optimal number of consecutive points that assigned to be <b>checked</b> <b>in</b> each <b>thread</b> to generate the highest efficiency cannot be determined; {{this is due to}} the distribution of input points and the number of remaining points after the first round of discarding. It is probably to determine the optimal number of threads for a specifically distributed set of remaining points; but it is unable to do this for general cases. Thus, it needs more experimental tests to determine the optimal number of points that are assigned to each thread.|$|R
