The observation of adhering particles was done in situ during the deposition process {{with the aid of}} an image analyzer and the adsorption and desorption of each particle was monitored individually using a special tracking algorithm. Initial deposition rates j(0) (EXP) were higher to positively charged glass than to {{negatively charged}} glass <b>collector</b> <b>surfaces,</b> depending on shear rates and ionic strength. All observed experimental deposition rates were, however, smaller than the Smoluchowski-Levich (SL) approximate solution of the convective-diffusion (CD) equation. Initial deposition rates were also calculated using an exact numerical solution of the CD equation; they were two times higher than the experimentally observed deposition rates for positively charged glass and about equal or lower for negatively charged glass. The desorption rates j(des) (t) Of polystyrene particles on positively charged glass were nearly zero under all conditions, whereas the desorption rates from the negatively charged glass were considerable and finally balanced the adsorption rates j(ads) (t). From the residence time dependent desorption probability beta(t - tau), it could be determined that polystyrene particles on negatively charged <b>collector</b> <b>surfaces</b> have the highest probability of desorption within the first 5 - 10 min after deposition. Experimental results were subsequently compared with those from a proposed adsorption-desorption model for deposition kinetics, using the parameters derived as an input, and with a Monte Carlo simulation of the deposition process. A high degree of similarity between experimental results, the adsorption-desorption model and the Monte Carlo simulation results was observed, which indicates; the consistency of the applied experimental methods and theoretical models...|$|R

The influence of hydrophobic interactions on the deposition process was kept {{the same for all}} combinations of strains and polymers by choosing strains and polymers with similar water contact angles. Zeta potentials of the strains ranged from - 14. 5 to + 4. 5 mV and zeta potentials for the <b>collector</b> <b>surfaces</b> were - 13 mV for PMMA and + 2 mV for PMMA/TMAEMA-Cl. Deposition efficiencies were expressed as the ratios between the experimentally observed initial deposition rates and the initial deposition rates, calculated {{on the basis of the}} Smoluchowski-Levich approximation. In case of the negatively charged PMMA collectors, deposition efficiencies decreased with increasing electrostatic repulsion between bacteria and the collector, as theoretically expected. However, in case of the positively charged PMMA/TMAEMA-Cl collectors, no such relation was found. This may be due to the fact that the surface charge of this material easily change in time after contact with buffer. Another reason may be the high mobility of the molecules, easily reorienting themselves when contacted with different interfaces, like a fluid or a cell interface...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} {{analyzes}} the compatibility of the simplified empirical method {{based on the}} dimensionless parameter of Solar Load Ratio (SLR) and the monthly procedure of the standard ISO 13790 for indirect gains, specifically for unconditioned zones adjacent to a conditioned zone, but separated from it by a partition wall (sunspaces). The main contribution of the work presented here is the new formulation to account SLR correlations in ISO 13790, obtained for sunspaces, but generalizable for other solar systems with known SLR functions. Simulation models are used to perform a sensitivity analysis of internal gains and heat transfer through solar <b>collector</b> <b>surfaces,</b> both issues that distinguishes ISO 13790 from Load Ratio methods. The analysis shows that internal gains {{can be added to}} the heat source term or subtracted to heat transfer term without influencing the utilization factor dependence with the gain-to-loss ratio. On the other hand, the SLR assumption that solar <b>collector</b> <b>surfaces</b> are neutral elements and, therefore, not added to the heat transfer term, results in large inconsistencies between SLR and ISO 13790 methods. The detailed monthly methodology of ISO 13790 fairly reproduces results obtained by simulation. However, predictions from the simplified monthly methodology of ISO 13790 fail in mid season months and coldest months...|$|R

The LECA (for bge Electrostatically Charged-) system uses a high voltage source {{to charge the}} <b>collector</b> <b>surfaces</b> (e. g., furniture pieces were used) once they have been electrically isolated from ground by teflon film. When a piece was touched by the high voltage lead its entire surface immediately become charged to about 60 % of the line voltage regardless of its material makeup. By limiting the current to 250 ua no sparking or shock sensation was experienced when touching the charged wire or <b>collector</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Progeny collection efficiencies were measured for collector areas from 8. 6 to 5 1. 8 m 2 and voltages from 2. 5 to 9 KV in an 82 m 3 test-room.

BACKGROUND Lung cancer, the priiciple radon health effect, is not caused by the radon gas itself but by its progeny, especially by the smaller unattached progeny particles that can penetrate into the deep respiratory tract.

5000|$|Thermodynamic {{benefits}} are that daily steam turbine startup losses are eliminated. [...] Major factors limiting the load output of a {{combined cycle power plant}} are the allowed pressure and temperature transients of the steam turbine {{and the heat}} recovery steam generator waiting times to establish required steam chemistry conditions and warm-up times for the balance of plant and the main piping system. Those limitations also influence the fast start-up capability of the gas turbine by requiring waiting times. And waiting gas turbines consume gas. The solar component, if the plant is started after sunshine, or before, if we have heat storage, allows us to preheat the steam to the required conditions. That is, the plant is started faster and we consume less gas before achieving operating conditions.

It is suggested that high affinity sites for particle deposition exist on glass, on which preferential (re) deposition is mediated through attractive electrostatic interactions.

40|$|Following a {{successful}} dust collection flight {{in the upper}} stratosphere our DUSTER (Dust in the Upper Stratosphere Tracking Experiment and Retrieval) made a safe remote landing at its assigned location on Baffin Island during early June 2009. When the balloon payload that included DUSTER was retrieved it was found part of the payload had experienced a lithium-sparked fire while the payload was being dragged across the landing site. In this process the housing of DUSTER had developed a pin-sized hole that allowed smoke of the fire to enter the collector. Numerous smoke particles were found covering both the DUSTER collection and blank <b>collector</b> <b>surfaces</b> an indication that our experiment to collect upper stratospheric dust had failed! Both <b>collector</b> <b>surfaces</b> were covered by numerous carbon smoke and amorphous, aluminosilica nanoparticles.

At a pH lower than the point of zero charge (PZC) of hematite, the affinity of AgNPs for a hematite-coated glass bead (FeO-GB) surface was significantly higher than that for an uncoated surface. There was a linear correlation between the average nanoparticle affinity for media composed of mixtures of FeO-GB and GB collectors and the relative composition of those media as quantified by the attachment efficiency over a range of mixing mass ratios of the two types of collectors, so that the average AgNPs affinity for these media is readily predicted from the mass (or surface) weighted average of affinities for each of the surface types.
