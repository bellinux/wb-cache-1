40|$|Miya-Gold is an {{additive}} containing viable spores of {{a single}} strain of Clostridium butyricum as the active agent. It is presently authorised for use in diets for weaned piglets, minor weaned porcine species, <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and minor avian species for fattening. The applicant is now seeking to reduce the minimum authorised dose from 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed to 2. 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed when used with <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and all minor avian species (except laying birds) and to extend this authorisation to chickens reared for laying. The safety for the consumers, users of the product and the environment has been previously assessed by EFSA {{and found that it}} did not raise concerns. In a previous opinion the FEEDAP Panel concluded that the additive is safe for <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> when used at the then recommended dose. The Panel considers that this conclusion can be extended to chickens reared for laying. This conclusion can be taken to apply to the revised dose for all of species under application. The data from three trials made with <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> confirmed the effectiveness of the additive when used at the currently authorised dose of 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed. Effects with the reduced dose of 2. 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed were less clear and showed significantly positive results in only two of the five trials in which this dose was tested. However, a meta-analysis made by pooling results from the five trials showed significant gains in final body weight and improved feed conversion indicating that the additive had some potential to improve performance of <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at the lower dose.

This product is authorised for use in <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> as a zootechnical additive, functional group of digestibility enhancers. The applicant seeks for {{the extension of the}} use of the additive to chickens reared for laying and to minor poultry species for fattening at a dose range of 50 to 100 alpha-galactosidase units and of 285 to 570 glucanase units per kg feed (corresponding to 50 to 100 mg additive/kg feed). In a previous evaluation the additive was shown to be safe in <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at a dose of 100 galactosidase and 570 glucanase units per kg feed. The FEEDAP Panel considers that this conclusion can be extended to chickens reared for laying. Given the margin of safety established for the major species, these conclusions can be extrapolated to minor poultry species for fattening. The potential of the product to be efficacious when used in <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> was previously established at the dose of  50 U galactosidase and 285 U glucanase per kg feed. The FEEDAP Panel considers that this conclusion applies to chickens reared for laying.

Therefore, the additive is safe for these target species at the recommended dose. The conclusion can be extended to pigs <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and can be extrapolated to ducks, guinea fowls, quails, geese, pheasants and pigeons provided that the same dose applies. The fermentation product used for the preparation of the additive gave negative results for mutagenicity. The results obtained in a sub-chronic oral toxicity study raised no concerns regarding the product. Therefore, the additive gives rise to no concern for consumer safety.

40|$|Copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl, {{provided}} as powder and as granulate, {{is intended for}} use as a copper source in animal nutrition. Tolerance studies with <b>chicken</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and weaned piglets, allowed the FEEDAP Panel to conclude that copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl is a safe source of copper for all animal species, provided that the maximum copper contents authorised in feed are respected. The supplementation of feeds with copper from copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl up to the maximum authorised copper levels is not expected to result in a different copper deposition in edible tissues/products than the standard inorganic source cupric sulphate pentahydrate. No concerns for consumer safety will arise from the use of the additive in animal nutrition, provided that the maximum copper contents authorised in feed are respected. The powder form of copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl should be considered as a risk by inhalation; exposure by inhalation should be minimised. Neither form of the additive is a dermal irritant but the powder form is an eye irritant. In the absence of data, it is considered prudent to regard both forms as potential skin sensitisers. Copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl is intended to be a substitute for other authorised copper additives; it will therefore not further increase the environmental burden from copper. Copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl is an efficacious source of copper in meeting animal requirements. The Panel made some recommendations regarding the Description and Conditions of use of the additive and the maximum residue limits established for copper in animal tissues and products...|$|R
40|$|Clinacox® 0. 5 % is a feed {{additive}} containing 0. 5 % diclazuril {{and is used}} to control coccidiosis in poultry. The previous conclusion on the safety of diclazuril in <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at the use level of 1 mg/kg complete feed is extended to chickens reared for laying. Chickens reared for laying are in a similar physiological stage as <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b> The use level proposed for diclazuril in feed {{is the same for}} both categories of birds. Consequently, the metabolic fate and residue status of this additive described for <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> can be extrapolated to chickens reared for laying. Feeding diclazuril at 1 mg/kg complete feed to chickens reared for laying for the first 16 weeks of life would result in negligibly low or absent residues of diclazuril in the first eggs for production. Therefore, maximum residue levels (MRLs) for eggs are not necessary. The previous assessment of consumer safety for the use of diclazuril in <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> is confirmed and extended to chickens reared for laying. The same MRLs for tissues as already established can be applied. Clinacox® has a low irritation potential for the eye and skin. Skin sensitisation was not observed. Considering the particle size (particle of respirable size) and dusting potential, exposure by inhalation cannot be excluded, although workers’ exposure has been calculated to be low in comparison with the ADI. In the absence of any data on respiratory toxicity, a hazard from inhalation of dust cannot be entirely excluded and appropriate protective measures should be taken. The use of Clinacox® at 1 mg/kg complete feed does not pose a risk to the terrestrial or aquatic environment.

The strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics, except for kanamycin which is considered of no concern. There were no adverse effects seen in calves when Cylactin® was administered at a 100 -fold overdose. Consequently, Cylactin® is considered safe <b>for</b> calves <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and <b>for</b> rearing at the recommended dose. This conclusion was extended to kids <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and rearing. However, lambs <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> are not considered a minor species and require a separate demonstration of safety which was not provided. No additional concerns would arise for consumers, users and the environment from the proposed extension of use. Seven trials made with calves <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> or rearing were considered.

40|$|Probiotic LACTINA® is a feed {{additive}} consisting of six strains of lactic acid bacteria. In 2007 the European Food Safety Authority was requested {{to evaluate the}} safety and efficacy of the additive when used as a zootechnical additive (functional group: gut flora stabilisers) in diets for <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> piglets and pigs for fattening. At that time the FEEDAP Panel was able to conclude only on the safety for the environment. EFSA is now requested to assess the safety for the target animals and consumers, and {{the efficacy of the}} additive when added in diets for <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at 5 x 108 - 9 x 109 CFU/kg feed and for piglets at 9 x 108 - 1 x 1010 CFU/kg feed. The identity of the six strains was established. As no antibiotic resistance of concern was detected and as five of the strains qualify for the Qualified Presumption of Safety approach to safety assessment, their use is presumed safe for target species and consumers. The Enterococcus faecium strain is not a recognised pathogen for animals and as the additive did not adversely affect growth of chickens or piglets, Probiotic LACTINA® is considered safe for the target species up to 1 x 1010 CFU/kg feed. The E. faecium strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections. The metabolic pathways of E. faecium are well known. Since no other harmful metabolites are expected and the additive does not contain excipients of concern, it is considered safe for consumers. Probiotic LACTINA® showed a potential to increase the body weight of suckling piglets when used at approximately 5 x 109 CFU/kg feed.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{determine}} how forage triticale in diets for fattening broilers influence the body weight and weight gain of broiler <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b> The survey was conducted on 400 <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> provenance Ross 308 for a period of 42 days. On this occasion, four groups of chickens were formed, with 100 chickens being treated in each group, as follows: K (classic mixture for fattening broilers) and O-I (mixtures with triticale variety Kg 20), O-II (mixtures with triticale Favorit) and O-III group (mixtures with triticale Trijumf). The highest average body mass in the groups of chickens (male, female and chicks of both sexes), was scored by broiler chickens of O-II-group. The minimum food consumption for 42 -day-old chicks was achieved by group O-I (4. 275 kg), and the most by O-II group (4. 359 kg). Chickens of O-II- and III-O-group had the best feed conversion, while the chickens of O-I-group had a slightly poorer feed conversion. The mortality of the groups of chickens for the entire period of the study was the lowest in O-II-group, at 2. 0 %, and the highest mortality was found in O-III-group (6. 0 %). The production index was the highest in O-II-group (202. 726) and the lowest in O-I-group.

The method used for this study was discrete Comparative Structural Analysis of New Institutional Economics that compares different governance structures as a way to minimize transaction costs. Results reveal that the incomplete stage of the agro-industrial system for broilers in Tocantins, especially characteristics of the local market and suppliers still contribute to informality in various links of the supply chain.

40|$|The European Food Safety Authority {{received}} {{a request from}} the European Commission to issue an opinion on the safety of Kokcisan 120 G for <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> based on the new data provided by the applicant in the supplementary dossier. Data submitted by the applicant on Kokcisan 120 G were previously reviewed by the FEEDAP Panel in May 2004 and found to be insufficient for conclusions to be reached on efficacy and safety. In response to this review the applicant has conducted further studies to address the inadequacies previously identified and the additional studies are reviewed in the following opinion. From the supplementary metabolic studies, it has been concluded that unchanged salinomycin represents less than 10 % of the total radioactivity in the excreta regardless of gender. The results presented identify more than 20 metabolites in chicken excreta, each representing less than 10 % of the total radioactivity. The metabolic profiles in chicken and rat excreta and tissues {{are found to be}} qualitatively similar. Kinetics study of total residues and SAL-Na residues in chicken tissues from animals dosed at maximum dose proposed was provided and Salinomycin sodium could be considered as a marker residue...|$|E
40|$|Scientific Opinion on {{the safety}} and {{efficacy}} of Bacillus subtilis PB 6 for chickens reared for laying, ducks for fattening, quails, pheasants, partridges, guinea fowl, pigeons, geese for fattening and ostriches 1 EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) 2, 3 European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Parma, Italy Bacillus subtilis PB 6 is the trade name for a feed additive based on viable spores of a strain of Bacillus subtilis. It is presently authorised for use with <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at a minimum dose of 1 x 107 CFU/kg of complete feedingstuffs. The applicant is now seeking authorisation for use with chickens reared for laying, ducks for fattening, quails, pheasants, partridges, guinea fowl, pigeons, geese for fattening and ostriches. B. subtilis is a species that is considered by EFSA to be suitable for Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) approach to safety assessment. The sensitivity to antibiotics {{and the absence of}} toxigenic potential qualified the strain for QPS status. On this basis the product can be presumed safe for chickens reared for laying, ducks for fattening, quails, pheasants, partridges, guinea fowl, pigeons, geese for fattening, and ostriches, for consumers of products derived from thes...|$|E

40|$|To {{throw some}} light on the subject of succulence <b>for</b> winter <b>fattening</b> of lambs, with especial {{reference}} to the use of corn silage in that capacity, a series of experiments was conducted during three winters, beginning December, 1906. These experiments were planned to indicate the principal results attending the feeding of succulent feed to fattening lambs and to furnish a comparison between the old time special crops for this purpose, and corn silage, the only succulent feed practicable for winter use on an extensive scale. The immediate objects of the work were as follows: 1. To compare a ration of grain and hay <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> lambs with rations containing succulent feed. 2. To compare sugar beets, mangels, turnips, rutabagas, cabbage, and corn silage as sources of succulence <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> lambs. 3. To determine whether succulent feed is essential to rapid gains, high condition, and quality of finish...|$|R
