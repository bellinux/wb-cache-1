50|$|The Brazilian <b>red</b> {{and white}} <b>{{tarantula}}</b> (Nhandu chromatus) {{is a larger}} tarantula with a diagonal leg span of approximately 15 - 17 cm. The Brazilian <b>red</b> and white <b>tarantula</b> is noted for its white striped legs, beige to grey prosoma, and the reddish hairs on the opisthosoma. Males and females look the same until the ultimate (final) molt of the males. At this point the male will exhibit sexual dimorphism {{in the form of}} a duller coloration and legginess. Additionally males will gain an embolus on the pedipalps and tibial apophysis (mating hooks). The Brazilian <b>red</b> and white <b>tarantula</b> is a terrestrial species that will often make a burrow or make use of an abandoned burrow.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Seed {{size and}} its {{physiology}} are a barrier for {{the exchange of}} coconut genetics resources and the tissue culture techniques can assist the germplasm bank enrichment. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of transport and storage procedures of zygotic embryos to promote the exchange of coconut accessions. Mature zygotic embryo from <b>Cameroon</b> <b>red</b> dwarf (CRD), Malayan yellow dwarf (MYD) and Malayan red dwarf (MRD) were used. The following treatments were evaluated: T 1 -storage of endosperm disc in plastic bags at 10 ± 2 °C for 5 days; T 2 - 8 days; T 3 - 12 days; T 4 - embryo excised and inoculated in micro tube with Y 3 culture medium with no sucrose for 2 days and T 5 - five embryos inoculated in Y 3 culture medium without sucrose in Petri dish for 2 days. T 5 treatment resulted in low bacterial contamination...|$|R

This may be based on unnoticed nuances, local climate or weather patterns, the personalities of the individual animals, or other minute details. This is a basic husbandry and breeding guide to the Mexican <b>red</b> knee <b>tarantula</b> (Brachypelma smithi). Any more specifics will have to be discovered personally or discussed with colleagues. Where many vertebrates have been kept in captivity for centuries a lot of invertebrates are relatively new to the husbandry world. Even though humans have kept and captive bred many tarantulas for decades; keepers and hobbyists around the world are still discovering new husbandry techniques and new species to keep every year. The Mexican <b>red</b> knee <b>tarantula</b> (Brachypelma smithi (F. O. Pickard-Cambridge, 1897)) is a species of robust spider. The genus is found only in Southern North America and Central America; primarily Mexico to Panama (Valerrio 1980; Smith 1994). Brachypelma smithi is found along the Western faces of the Sierra Madre del Sur and Sierra Madre Occidental mountain ranges in Mexico. This terrestrial species rarely leaves the comfort of its burrow in the wild. Their burrows can be found near rocks or at the base of vegetation (Lockt, 1999). Mature males will participate in an annual migration to find willing partners but females and immature specimen stay relatively stationary. Like all arachnids, Brachypelma are characterized by two body segments and eight legs. Their fangs are oriented vertically, grouping them into the Suborder Mygalomorphae. The Mexican <b>red</b> kneed <b>tarantula</b> sports a black abdomen covered by brown/ red hairs. The cephalothorax is also black with a khaki colored ring. The Brachypelma smithi is renowned for the bright orange to red-orange splashes of color on their patella; they may also sport smaller patches of color on the legs below the patella (Gurley, 1993). New World tarantulas are notorious for their ability to discharge urticating hairs. When the spider feels threatened it may scrape the back of its abdomen and flick a cloud of microscopic needles that is capable of causing pain and discomfort to those that are easily irritated. Brachypelma are generally mild mannered and do not always respond to disturbances by flicking hairs or displaying a threat posture. The venom is an insect specific neurotoxin (Zhong, Y., Song, B., Lu, Q., et al., 2014). However, it can cause pain and discomfort similar to a bee sting. The tarantulas of the genus Brachypelma are long-lived. The males reach maturity in 3 - 7 years, living only one year or less after the last molt. The females however, reach maturity in 4 - 10 years, and then are capable of living another decade or two (Locht, 1999). The Brachypelma species from the west coast of Mexico are particularly docile and colorful. These traits have led to their being collected in large numbers for the pet trade. The destruction of the natural habitat and the high mortality before sexual maturity (99 %) (Baerg, 1958) are two factors that affect the populations of these species, and combined with the illegal trade that normally involves the capture of pre-adult and adult tarantulas, can cause the extinction of these tarantulas. To regulate this trade and prevent their endangerment, all the species of this genus have been listed in appendix II of CITES (Locht, Yanez and Vazquez 1999). The IUCN lists the Red Knee tarantula as a Near Threatened species. Mexican <b>red</b> kneed <b>tarantulas</b> are widely used as educational ambassadors within many AZA facilities. Although being a long lived species, precautions were needed in order to keep this species in collections. Captive reproduction for this genus is common in the private tarantula hobby. However, this species is rarely bred in AZA institutions. In 2007 the Mexican <b>red</b> kneed <b>tarantula</b> became an AZA managed program within the Terrestrial Invertebrate Taxon Advisory Group...|$|R
2500|$|Brachypelma {{species are}} docile tarantulas which {{are easy to}} keep in a terrarium. [...] The best-known species in this genus are the Mexican <b>red</b> knee <b>tarantulas</b> B.hamorii and B.smithi, curly hair B.albopilosum, and the Mexican red rump B.vagans. They feed on smaller {{invertebrates}} and occasionally vertebrates, but while insects are the norm, they may also eat lizards or frogs. These species, like most tarantulas, are cannibalistic, so in captivity, individuals must be kept singly, though brief captive introductions of a mate for breeding purposes can prove unproblematic, {{so long as they}} are separated once mating has occurred.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>Cameroon,</b> a <b>red</b> [...] "X" [...] {{placed on}} {{illegally}} constructed buildings scheduled for demolition is occasionally {{referred to as}} a [...] "St Andrew's Cross". It is usually accompanied by the letters [...] "A.D." [...] ("à détruire"—French for [...] "to be demolished") and a date or deadline. During a campaign of urban renewal by the Yaoundé Urban Council in Cameroon, the cross was popularly referred to as [...] "Tsimi's Cross" [...] after the Government Delegate to Yaoundé Urban Council Gilbert Tsimi Evouna.|$|R
2500|$|Habitat {{destruction}} and collection for the pet trade {{have led to}} these spiders being among the few arthropods protected under international Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species rules. In 1985, B.smithi (then not distinguished from B.hamorii) was placed on CITES Appendix II, and in 1994, all remaining Brachypelma species were added. Large numbers of Mexican tarantulas caught in the wild continue to be smuggled out of Mexico. It is reported that at least 3,000 specimens of Mexican tarantulas {{were sent to the}} United States or Europe a few years prior to 2017, most of which were Mexican <b>red</b> knee <b>tarantulas</b> (B.hamorii and B.smithi). Turner and colleagues suggest that members of their [...] "red leg" [...] group, which have small ranges and are slow to mature and reproduce, should be the focus of urgent conservation measures, with threats to species in the [...] "red rump" [...] group possibly being downgraded.|$|R
50|$|The Ultimate Marvel {{alternative}} universe {{version is}} a decomposite character where both are clones of Spider-Man (Peter Parker). Like their genetic template, Kaine and Tarantula possessed superhuman strength, reflexes, equilibrium, {{and had a}} spider-sense. A misguided, disfigured clone, Kaine wears a tattered version of Ben Reilly's Spider-Man costume. In addition to his six arms and a variant black costume, Tarantula's unmasked appearance has more spider-like physical features, such as fangs, additional eyes and spiky hair along his entire face. Created by ambitious mastermind Dr. Octopus (acting with consent of the CIA), Kaine kidnaps Mary Jane Watson and attempts to give his captive superpowers (via OZ), triggering a transformation into a large <b>red</b> monster despite <b>Tarantula's</b> efforts. While he tries to prevent Mary Jane from being taken, Kaine is killed by Nick Fury's Spider Slayers. During Peter's and Spider-Woman's fight with Dr. Octopus, Tarantula attacks his maker and is killed as a result.|$|R
