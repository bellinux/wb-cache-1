50|$|Cyborg Kuro-chan (Saibōgu Kurochan) is a shōnen manga series {{created by}} Naoki Yokouchi, {{serialized}} in Kodansha's Comic BonBon magazine. Eleven {{volumes of the}} manga were released between 1998 and 2002. It centers on the titular character, a housecat who is kidnapped and modified by a mad scientist {{to be a part}} of a cyborg army bent on world domination. Kuro breaks his control <b>chip,</b> <b>escapes</b> and becomes a vigilante. Kuro has many allies, who help him out during instances such as urban destruction, parallel universes, outer space, and battles between other cats and cyborgs.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe rotor–router {{model is}} a {{deterministic}} analogue of random walk. It {{can be used to}} define a deterministic growth model analogous to internal DLA. We show that the set of occupied sites for this model on an infinite regular tree is a perfect ball whenever it can be, provided the initial rotor configuration is acyclic (that is, no two neighboring vertices have rotors pointing to one another).

Then still AW’s editor, he posted a description of his car on the forum section, which led to a forum member spotting it on the road.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} type of power driven tap is the [...] "spiral point" [...] plug tap, whose cutting edges are {{angularly}} displaced relative to the tap centerline. This feature causes the tap to continuously break the chip and eject it forward into the hole, preventing crowding. Spiral point taps are usually used in holes that go {{all the way through the}} material, so that the <b>chips</b> can <b>escape.</b> Another version of the spiral point plug tap is the spiral flute tap, whose flutes resemble those of a twist drill. Spiral flute taps are widely used in high speed, automatic tapping operations due to their ability to work well in blind holes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{manufacturing}} defect is a finite chip area with electrically malfunctioning circuitry caused by fabrication errors. The fraction of defective <b>chips</b> that <b>escapes</b> {{to the customer}} is called the defect level, also known as defective parts per million (DPPM, or simply PPM) when normalized to one million units. This paper demonstrates a technique used to correlate coverage goals to DPPM based on test fallout data using a MATLAB ®-based error function minimization approach. This analysis is explained using regression models for DPPM yield versus fault/defect coverage. This approach is beneficial to semiconductor companies for calibrating their fault coverage goals to meet DPPM requirements from automotive or other customers that have very aggressive (i. e., ultra-low) DPPM demands...|$|R
5|$|Needy decides {{she must}} kill Jennifer. She goes to Jennifer's home and sees her, already recovered, picking out her next victims in her yearbook. Crashing {{through the window}} with a box cutter, Needy fights Jennifer and stabs her in the heart, {{destroying}} the demon and killing her. Jennifer's mother enters and finds Needy with the box cutter {{on top of her}} daughter's body. Soon after, Needy is brought to an asylum. As she was bitten non-fatally by Jennifer, she manifests some of Jennifer's supernatural powers, such as the ability to hover in the air. Desiring revenge for what was done to her, Jennifer, and <b>Chip,</b> Needy <b>escapes</b> the mental facility and hitchhikes a ride to the hotel where Low Shoulder are staying; there, she slaughters the members, whose killings are later discovered by local authorities.|$|R
5|$|At {{school the}} {{following}} day, {{the town is}} stunned by Colin's death. Needy goes to the school library's occult section and determines that Jennifer is a succubus; she is weakest when she is hungry and must feed on flesh in order to sustain her life and appearance. Needy tells Chip about her discoveries and warns him not to attend the school dance. He does not believe her, so she breaks up with him {{in order to protect}} him. Chip still goes to the dance, hoping to meet with Needy, but is instead intercepted by Jennifer, who seduces him and takes him to an abandoned pool house. Needy arrives there and finds Jennifer feeding on Chip. Needy tries to drown Jennifer but Jennifer, hovering in the air, attacks her. She is then stabbed with a pool skimmer by a fatally injured <b>Chip.</b> Jennifer <b>escapes</b> while Needy watches her boyfriend die.|$|R

Crashing through the window, Needy engages {{in a fight with}} Jennifer {{wielding}} a box cutter. Culminating with a stab to the heart, Needy finally destroys the demon and kills her. Jennifer's mother enters and finds Needy with the box cutter on top of her daughter's body. Soon after, Needy is brought to an asylum. Since she was bitten non-fatally by Jennifer, she has obtained some of Jennifer's supernatural powers, such as the ability to hover in the air. Set upon revenge for what was done to herself, Jennifer, and <b>Chip,</b> she <b>escapes</b> the mental facility and hitchhikes a ride to the hotel where Low Shoulder are staying; there, she slaughters the members, whose killings are later discovered by local authorities.|$|R
40|$|The Dbl {{protein is}} a product of a {{proto-oncogene}} that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho-family GTPases. It is responsible for activating the GTPases by facilitating the dissociation of GDP thus allowing for the binding of GTP. Intracellular levels of Dbl are regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. CHIP is the E 3 protein-ubiquitin ligase responsible for this ubiquitination. More specifically, the Ubox domain of CHIP is critical to this interaction. Oncogenic Dbl, which lacks its spectrin domain, cannot bind <b>CHIP</b> and therefore <b>escapes</b> degradation. This causes accumulation of the oncogene product in the cell, and leads to persistent activation of its downstream pathways...|$|R
40|$|Contact Author and {{designated}} presenter The theory {{behind the}} design of combinational circuits to compact scan chain responses (also called X-Compactor circuits) was described {{in one of our}} previous papers. This paper presents an analysis to estimate the expected number of defective <b>chips</b> that may <b>escape</b> detection due to the presence of the X-Compactor circuits. With the help of practical design data it is shown that the impact on the product DPM due to the presence of the X-Compactor is negligible for all practical purposes. A very simple extension to the basic X-Compact approach provides exponential reduction in test response data volume for all practical purposes without any impact on DPM. 1 15 -Oct- 2002 1...|$|R
5000|$|Erin Strauss (portrayed by Jayne Atkinson; seasons 2-8, 9; 23 episodes), an Assistant Director and the BAU Unit Chief's direct superior. While her FBI {{experience}} was primarily in administration, SSA Derek Morgan remarked on her masterly marksmanship, after observing {{her at a}} firing range. In early episodes, Strauss appeared only concerned with herself and appearances within the Bureau, {{going so far as}} to force SSA Jennifer Jareau to accept a promotion to the Pentagon in the episode [...] "JJ" [...] (season 6). Further character development revealed her alcohol abuse. After being confronted by Morgan and Hotchner, Strauss accepts help and achieves sobriety. In the season eight finale, the Replicator breaks into Strauss' hotel room in New York, drugs her, and forces her - at gunpoint - to drink alcohol from her room's minibar. Hotchner finds her on a bench near the hotel, where Strauss dies in his arms. Her death is avenged when Rossi traps the Replicator in an exploding house. Fittingly, Strauss's sobriety helps defeat the Replicator as Rossi uses her sobriety <b>chip</b> to <b>escape</b> the Replicator's trap and taunts him with it. After attending her funeral, the members of the BAU gather in a still-emotional Rossi's backyard, reminisce, and toast her memory. Showrunner Erica Messer chose to kill Strauss off because she felt that the character had come full circle since she was first introduced.|$|R
