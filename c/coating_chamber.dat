This status will change when the NPOI four 1.8-meter telescopes see their own first light in the near future. KSAR rides {{in the arms of}} an equatorial fork mount. The telescope is used in both the visible spectrum, and in the near infrared (NIR), the latter using a sub-30-kelvin, helium-refrigerated, InSb (Indium antimonide) camera, [...] "Astrocam". In 1978, the 1.55-m telescope was used to [...] "discover the moon of dwarf planet Pluto, named 'Charon'". (Pluto itself was discovered in 1930, across town at Lowell Observatory). The Charon discovery led to mass calculations which ultimately revealed how tiny Pluto was, and eventually caused the IAU to reclassify Pluto as a dwarf (not a principle) planet. The 1.55-meter telescope was also used to observe and track NASA's Deep Impact Spacecraft, as it navigated to a successful inter-planetary impact with the celebrated Comet 9p/Tempel, in 2005.

The coating is more uniform when a higher discharging voltage is applied, which means more energy is deposited into the copper wire in the identical time, so the wire will be destructed more efficiently.

40|$|ZrTiV Non Evaporable Getter (NEG) {{coatings}} of {{vacuum chambers}} have found application in particle accelerators {{to lower the}} gas pressure, during the operative conditions. For that, the characterization of the actual pumping speed of the NEG coating is a key issue. It is carried out {{by means of the}} dynamic sorption method according to ASTM F 798 - 82 standard, conducted “offline ” on a sample (coupon), suitably positioned inside the <b>chamber</b> to be <b>coated</b> and recovered after the process. To evaluate in-situ the sorption characteristics of getter <b>coated</b> <b>chambers,</b> a different measurement technique (Trasmission Factor Method) is here described. It is based on the measurement of pressures ratio at the inlet and the outlet of a coated pipe, under a flow of test gas. A calibration curve permits to evaluate sticking probability of the coated surface from the pressure ratio. The use of reference samples to calibrate the method is quite difficult. A better approach is a modellistic one, finding the dependency of pressure ratio on the average sticking probability, the pipe length, the section geometry and dimensions. Preliminary experimental results will be shown...|$|R
40|$|Subscale rocket {{thrust chamber}} tests were {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and durability of thin yttria stabilized zirconium oxide coatings applied to the thrust chamber hot-gas side wall. The fabrication consisted of arc plasma spraying the ceramic coating and bond coat onto a mandrell and then electrodepositing the copper thrust chamber wall around the <b>coating.</b> <b>Chambers</b> were fabricated with coatings. 008, and. 005 and. 003 inches thick. The chambers were thermally cycled at a chamber pressure of 600 psia using oxygen-hydrogen as propellants and liquid hydrogen as the coolant. The thicker coatings tended to delaminate, early in the cyclic testing, down to a uniform sublayer which remained well adhered during the remaining cycles. Two chambers with. 003 inch coatings were subjected to 1500 thermal cycles with no coating loss in the throat region, which represents a tenfold increase in life over identical chambers having no coatings. An analysis is presented which shows that the heat lost to the coolant due to the coating, in a rocket thrust chamber design having a coating only in the throat region, can be recovered by adding only one inch to the combustion chamber length...|$|R
40|$|A DC {{sputtering}} system is used at Jefferson Lab to <b>coat</b> <b>chambers</b> with a Ti-Zr-V nonevaporable getter coating. Motivation Non-evaporable getters (NEGs) {{in a vacuum}} system are useful for their high pump speed for hydrogen and pumping capability for reactive gasses, primarily oxygen, nitrogen and water?? Getter material sintered to substrates {{can be used to}} add modular pumps to a system, and are activated at temperatures up to 450 °C or more through resistive heating of the substrate. The low-activationtemperature alloy of Ti-Zr-V in an approximately 1 : 1 : 1 ratio has been developed and shown to activate at the moderate temperature of a 250 °C bakeout, and is therefore appropriate for a coating on beampipes, where it can be activated during bakeout. A <b>coated</b> beampipe or <b>chamber</b> adds distributed pumping and can effectively eliminate net outgassing from the walls. Ti-Zr-V coatings with pump speeds up to 10 L/s/cm 2 are commercially available, deposited using DC magnetron sputtering to make the process commercially viable. We have been using a non-magnetron DC {{sputtering system}} to coat the 3 ” diameter beampipe leading from the CEBAF polarized electron guns to the beamline for the past 10 years. The measured pump speed of our coating is a modest 0. 02 L/s/cm 2, but has worked well as a distributed pump, reducing electron stimulated desorbtion at the gun exit and providing additional pumping to isolate the electron guns from the poorer vacuum of the beamline. The DC non-magnetron sputtering technique used at Jefferson Lab, based on the methods described by Benvenuti 1 and commercialized by SAES, is described here. Equipment and Supplies Require...|$|R
