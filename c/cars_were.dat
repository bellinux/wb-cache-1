5|$|Amtrak {{singled out}} the Broadway Limited for special {{treatment}} and in 1972 completely refurbished its equipment, {{most of which}} was ex-Penn Central, although former Union Pacific Railroad sleeping <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> also used. Amtrak also added a Slumbercoach to the consist. In 1974 Amtrak tried out rebuilt 6-bedroom, 8-roomette ex-Rock Island sleeping cars, but their limited capacity reduced revenue. The Broadway Limited began receiving rebuilt Heritage Fleet cars in 1980, and Amfleet coaches thereafter. 68 <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> rebuilt at a total cost of $9.8 million.|$|E
5|$|Despite high aspirations, the Metroliner cars {{proved to}} have poor reliability, {{with less than}} two-thirds of the fleet in service at many times. Four <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> {{successfully}} overhauled for improved operation in 1974, but the rebuilding cost more than the original purchase price of the cars. Thirty-three more <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> overhauled in 1979–1980. However, by this time, new AEM-7 locomotives pulling Amfleet cars could match Metroliner schedules with higher reliability. Metroliners were withdrawn from Metroliner service entirely in 1981; they served until 1988 on Keystone Service trains.|$|E

5|$|Four <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> {{entered in}} the GT1 class for the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, two by PC Automotive Jaguar and two by Chamberlain Engineering, though the latter did not run their cars. Neither team had Jaguar or TWR backing; both of PC Automotive's <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> outpaced by the new McLaren F1 GTR. Richard Piper, Tiff Needell and James Weaver were holding fourth {{position}} until an engine failure during the night, ending their race, whilst the second XJ220 retired after leaving the road.|$|E
5|$|I.J. Carruthers {{operated}} Carruthers Garage in Lashburn, and six Model T Ford <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> shipped here October 5, 1917. These cars required assembly, and {{in total}} 18 <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> sold in 1917, and 24 in 1918 with prices ranging from $563 to $818. Lashburn was served by Provincial Highway 5, the early name for Saskatchewan Highway 16.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 {{the line}} to Upminster was {{electrified}} and new vehicles were purchased. After the District Railway became part of London Underground, similar <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> ordered to allow the Metropolitan line be extended to Barking and replace some of the rapidly deteriorating original wooden trailers. The 1935–40 New Works Programme fitted electro-pneumatic brakes and air-operated doors {{to most of the}} District line stock and allowed the remaining wooden cars to be scrapped. A number of motor <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> not suitable for conversion and so some trains retained their hand-worked doors and these ran until 1957.|$|E
5000|$|The San Joaquin Daylights dining <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{replaced}} by a coffee-shop car by the 1950s. The parlor-observation <b>car</b> <b>was</b> also removed, though it immediately gained a second life. In 1954 SP placed two of its seven homebuilt dome-lounge cars in the consists; one of the <b>cars</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt from the trains own parlor-observation car. [...] The dome <b>car</b> <b>was</b> discontinued in the late 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Stolen <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> sold {{in foreign}} {{countries}} for several reasons. In underdeveloped countries, there are often fewer rules and less enforcement of laws pertaining to plates and title paperwork, so the <b>car</b> <b>is</b> {{less likely to be}} noticed. Criminals are also hopeful that there is little incentive {{on the part of the}} victim to search in other countries, as even if the <b>car</b> <b>is</b> found, recovery may cost more (in detective, legal, and transportation fees) than the <b>car</b> <b>is</b> actually worth. This is especially true if the stolen <b>car</b> <b>is</b> of low value.|$|R

5|$|When {{delivery}} of C67 stock began in 1977, {{two pairs of}} CO/CP stock motor <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> used as pilot motor cars to shunt the new stock at Ruislip Depot, and to marshall the scrap stock displaced by the new units. The C77 stock could be driven under its own power to Hammersmith Depot, as it was commissioned at Ruislip. The D78 stock was different, in that delivery was still to Ruislip, but the commissioning took place at Ealing Common Depot, and therefore pilot motor <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> needed to transfer the stock. Two pairs of CO/CP stock motor <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> allocated {{to do this in}} 1979, with a further three pairs joining them in 1980. New trains were transferred with a pilot motor car at each end, as were trains that were withdrawn for scrapping. The pilot motor cars carried large stencils at both ends, so that they would not accidentally be scrapped until their duties were complete. Three pairs of R stock motor <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> used as pilot motor cars after the R stock was scrapped. Most of the surface stock pilot motor <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> scrapped when the deliveries were complete, although one each of the CO/CP and R stock cars have been privately preserved.|$|E

5|$|After the war trains faced {{competition}} from aviation and automobiles, and serving trolleys were installed on Norwegian trains. In 1965 cart service on trains was centralised and standardised; food service was faster, and prices were lowered. During the 1970s cafeteria <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> used, where passengers could serve themselves.|$|E
5|$|Due to high winds, two <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> {{crushed by}} falling trees, causing {{the deaths of}} two men and one 12-year-old boy. Hispaniola {{received}} heavy rain and 35mph (56km/h) winds but no deaths or damage was reported. In the Bahamas, the storm brought winds of 35mph (56km/h) but left no damage.|$|E
5|$|In La Paz, a {{town that}} at that time had a {{population}} of approximately85,000, 20,000were left homeless (nearly {{one third of the}} towns population), and an additional 4,000were injured. It is estimated that one out of five homes were destroyed in the city. Widespread flooding was reported throughout the city with mud filling up the first floor of many houses. This flash flooding led to many homes and automobiles being destroyed. Several roofs fell off of homes and landed deep in the mud. Many roads were blocked due to fallen trees while numerous homes were pushed off their foundation; some <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> also abandoned when Hurricane Liza struck. Some <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> reportedly piled against damaged building and debris. Nine people died when a car was swept away in the floodwaters.|$|E

5|$|Serial {{production}} of the T1000 started in 1964 by Strømmens Værksted, NEBB and AEG. Until 1978, 162 <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> delivered to Oslo Sporveier. These were manufactured in four series, designated T1 through T4, with minor changes to specifications. During the late 1970s, the western suburban lines which {{were part of the}} tramway needed new rolling stock. Oslo Sporveier was at the time considering connecting the metro with these lines, and between 1978 and 1981, 33 new T1300 <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> built. The only difference from the T1000 was that they had a pantograph that allowed them to operate on the tramways. They also retained the necessary technical appliances to run on the metro. The new T1300 were designated T5 and T6. From 1985 to 1989, 16 T4s were rebuilt to T1300 and designated T7 and T8.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2012, all <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> {{required}} to pass their mandatory FIA crash tests before {{being allowed to}} take part in pre-season testing. Previously, passing the crash tests was only a requirement prior to the first race of the season. Crash tests for the 2012 season will also be more rigorous than in previous years.|$|E
5|$|The death scenes {{required}} {{varying degrees}} of 2D and 3D graphic enhancement, with the roller coaster scene alone being composed of 144 visual-effect shots. Custom-designed coaster <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> created and modified, based on events in the script. Most of the model was hand-built, with MEL scripts aiding specific elements. The coaster-crash scenes were filmed with the actors performing {{in front of a}} green screen with a CGI background. Several of the roller coaster's <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> suspended with bungee cords to film the crash, and the deaths required CGI onscreen effects; each actor had a corresponding CGI double.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} produced {{light damage}} in the Outer Banks, primarily from flooding and high winds. Over 100houses were damaged, while numerous <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> disabled from the flooding. Damage totaled about $7.5million (2004USD). Alex produced strong waves and rip tides along the East Coast of the United States, causing one death and several injuries.|$|E
5|$|The next {{batch of}} ballast motor <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> French-built gate stock cars, {{originally}} constructed in 1906, but converted {{in the early}} 1920s to run with the 1920 air-door stock. 20 motor <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> converted, but were replaced by more modern cars in 1930. Although 12 of the displaced <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> scrapped, six were kept as ballast motor cars, becoming numbers L24 to L29 in the service fleet. The final two were further converted to run as single cars on the Aldwych shuttle. During the Second World War they were used as pilot motor cars for refreshment trains on the Piccadilly line, which supplied food to people sleeping on the stations {{to escape from the}} bombing of the city. They returned to the Aldwych shuttle between 1946 and 1949, but were again used as pilot motor cars after that, transferring cars between the engineering works at Acton and various depots. They were both coupled to a flat wagon for a period, and were used to transfer stores from Acton Works to Northfields depot, and also took stores to Croxley Green and Queens Park depots on the Bakerloo line.|$|E
