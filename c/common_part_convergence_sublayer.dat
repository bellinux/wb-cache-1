Packets from upper layer are mapped and categorized into five different service classes: unsolicited grant service (UGS), extended real-time polling service (ertPS), real-time polling service (rtPS), non-real-time polling service (nrtPS), and best effort (BE). UGS is for voice service with constant bit rate, and ertPS is targeted for voice-over IP without silence suppression that has variable data rate. In addition, rtPS is intended for real-time video applications. Delay-insensitive applications with large data transfer and web browsing are grouped under nrtPS and BE service class, respectively. As stated in [1], UGS has the highest precedence, followed by ertPS, rtPS, nrtPS, and lastly BE.

40|$|Advanced applications, such as {{distributed}} multimedia applications, require efficient communication subsystems {{providing a}} variety of services. Existing communication systems face increasing difficulties in fulfilling these requirements. In particular, the efficient provision of reliable group communication services in ATM-Networks remains a major unresolved issue. This paper presents a novel framework for Adaptation Layer error control mechanisms. Two adaptation layer protocols are presented that provide reliable multicast services. The first one, called RLMCP (Reliable Lightweight Multicast Protocol), is a simple and efficient adaptation layer protocol for the Service Specific <b>Convergence</b> <b>Sublayer</b> of AAL 5. It uses a frame-based ARQ-scheme and is suitable for virtual connections with low cell loss rates. The second one, called RMC-AAL (Reliable Multicast ATM Adaptation Layer), features cell-based ARQ in combination with FEC. The framework permits to select the combination of error control mechanisms most suitable for the application requirements in a specific communication scenario. The achievable performance is analysed, identifying the influence of group size, cell loss rate and path capacity on throughput and delay. Guidelines are presented for selection of the error control scheme most appropriate for a specific communication scenario. ...|$|R

A satellite system supports a number of PBNs by dynamically sharing the satellite resources.

40|$|One of {{the main}} issues {{emerging}} in satellite networks is the ecient and assured delivery of data. TCP/IP over ATM over poor quality links is known to fail catastrophically. The major source of this failure is that TCP incorrectly assumes all loss or corruption of data is due to network congestion, so TCP re-acts inappropriately. In general, two approaches can be consid-ered. In the rst approach, TCP distinguishes between conges-tion and non-congestion errors and handles the non-congestion errors properly. In the second approach, TCP is shielded from non-congestion errors, so that it doesn't invoke unnecessary con-gestion control mechanisms. In this paper, a Service Specic Coordination Function for Transparent Assured Delivery with AAL 5 (SSCF-TADA 5) is de-scribed. SSCF-TADA 5 operates to guarantee the transparent as-sured delivery of data in TCP/IP over ATM over degraded phys-ical link conditions such as those encountered on a satellite radio link, which is characterized by long propagation delay, high error rate with burst errors, and low throughput. Therefore, TCP is totally shielded from non-congestion errors resulting from poor physical link conditions. SSCF-TADA 5 coordinates between the user plane AAL 5 service interface and the Service Specic Con-nection Oriented Protocol (SSCOP), thereby forming a new Ser-vice Specic <b>Convergence</b> <b>Sublayer</b> (SSCS) supporting Classical IP over ATM. We discuss the design of SSCF-TADA 5, and then compare TCP/IP performance with and without SSCF-TADA 5. The results of the test show that assured delivery with SSCF-TADA 5 signicantlymitigates the degradation in the most severe cases, which combine high error rate with high channel utiliza-tion. ...|$|R
