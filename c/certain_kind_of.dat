This is a particularly symmetric and mathematically well behaved type of quantum field theory. Such theories are often studied in the context of string theory, where they are associated with the surface swept out by a string propagating through spacetime, and in statistical mechanics, where they model systems at a thermodynamic critical point.|$|E

And it's something that we do - we bring out elements that we want to emphasise.|$|E

25|$|The {{basic idea}} is that the overall binding free energy can be {{decomposed}} into independent components that are known to be important for the binding process. Each component reflects a <b>certain</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> free energy alteration during the binding process between a ligand and its target receptor. The Master Equation is the linear combination of these components. According to Gibbs free energy equation, the relation between dissociation equilibrium constant, Kd, and the components of free energy was built.|$|E

The theory of modular forms therefore belongs to complex analysis but the main importance of the theory has traditionally been in its connections with number theory. Modular forms appear in other areas, such as algebraic topology, sphere packing, and string theory.|$|E

In this sense the music would not paint the landscape, but it would match the landscape in a third category, the mood.|$|E

25|$|Age of Empires Online {{includes}} five {{classes of}} military units: Infantry, archers, cavalry, siege weaponry, and naval units. All military classes are developed {{to maintain a}} balance on gameplay, and thus avoiding visible advantages between civilizations. As an example, a unit powerful against buildings can be weak against a <b>certain</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> cavalry. Unique units are available for the Greek, Egyptian, Celts, and Persian civilizations, either {{from the start of}} the game or through advisor cards. These civilization-specific units are generally more powerful, but can still be vulnerable to certain units. The priest is a special kind of military unit that has the ability to convert enemy units to the player's civilization, and to heal allied units.|$|E

25|$|A type system {{associates}} a type {{with each}} computed value and, {{by examining the}} flow of these values, attempts to ensure or prove that no type errors can occur. The given type system in question determines exactly what constitutes a type error, but in general {{the aim is to}} prevent operations expecting a <b>certain</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> value from being used with values for which that operation does not make sense (logic errors); memory errors will also be prevented. Type systems are often specified as part of programming languages, and built into the interpreters and compilers for them; although the type system of a language can be extended by optional tools that perform added kinds of checks using the language's original type syntax and grammar.|$|E
25|$|A {{seemingly}} unrelated {{construction is}} the -function of number theory. This object {{belongs to a}} special class of functions called modular functions, whose graphs form a <b>certain</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> repeating pattern. Although this function appears in a branch of mathematics which seems {{very different from the}} theory of finite groups, the two subjects turn out to be intimately related. In the late 1970s, mathematicians John McKay and John Thompson noticed that certain numbers arising in the analysis of the monster group (namely, the dimensions of its irreducible representations) are related to numbers that appear in a formula for the -function (namely, the coefficients of its Fourier series). This relationship was further developed by John Horton Conway and Simon Norton who called it monstrous moonshine because it seemed so far fetched.|$|E
25|$|The search {{functionality}} {{is exposed}} using the search bars in the Start menu {{and the upper}} right hand corner of Windows Explorer windows, as well as Open/Save dialog boxes. When searching from the Start menu, the results are shown in the Start menu itself, overlapping the recently used programs. From the Start menu, {{it is also possible}} to launch an application by searching for its executable image name or display name. Searching from the search bars in Explorer windows replaces the content of the current folder with the search results. The Explorer windows can also render thumbnails in the search results if a Thumbnail Handler is registered for a particular file type. It can also render enhanced previews of items in a Preview Pane without launching the default application, if the application has registered a Preview Handler. This can provide functionality such as file type-specific navigation (such a browsing a presentation using next/previous controls, or seeking inside a media file). Preview handlers can also allow <b>certain</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> selections (such as highlighting a text snippet) to be performed from the preview pane itself. In the Control Panel, the search bar in the window can also search for Control Panel options. However, unlike WDS, Windows Search does not support creating aliases.|$|E
