Sonographic features <b>of</b> <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> thrombosis were an echogenic thrombus within the lumen of the vein (67 %), demonstration <b>of</b> <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> collateral crculation (48 %), enlargement of the thrombosed segment of the vein (38 %), and the so-called cavernomatous transformation <b>of</b> the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> (19 %).

METHODS: In this prospective study, 69 continuous patients with portal hypertension caused by hepatitis B cirrhosis underwent splenectomy with periesophagogastric devascularization in West China Hospital of Sichuan University from January 2007 to August 2010. The <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> flow velocity and the diameter <b>of</b> <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> were measured by Doppler sonography. The hepatic congestion index and {{the ratio of}} velocity and diameter were calculated before operation. The prothrombin time (PT) and platelet (PLT) levels were measured before and after operation. The patients&#x 2019; spleens were weighed postoperatively. RESULTS: The diameter <b>of</b> <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> was negatively correlated with the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> flow velocity (P < 0. 05). Thirty-three cases (47. 83 %) suffered from postoperative PVT. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in the Child-Pugh score, the spleen weights, the PT, or PLT levels between patients with PVT and without PVT. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed four variables (<b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> flow velocity, the ratio of velocity and diameter, hepatic congestion index and diameter <b>of</b> <b>portal</b> <b>vein)</b> could be used as preoperative predictors <b>of</b> postoperative <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> thrombosis.

A single pass, with a 22 gauge spinal needle, was performed in the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> lumen. Diagnosis <b>of</b> the aetiology <b>of</b> the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> thrombosis was obtained in all 15 cases. In 12 cases, a cytological diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma was made.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the value of intraportal endovascular ultrasonography (IPEUS) in the diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> invasion by pancreatobiliary carcinoma. The authors reported their experiences with this new technique and compared it with conventional imaging technologies, such as portography and computed tomography (CT). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Pancreatobiliary carcinoma often invades the <b>portal</b> <b>vein.</b> Observation <b>of</b> the echogenic band <b>of</b> the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> wall by means of a high-frequency, high-resolution intravascular ultrasound catheter allows for the accurate diagnosis <b>of</b> the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> invasion. METHODS: A prospective study of 30 consecutive patients with pancreatobiliary carcinoma (16 pancreatic carcinomas, 8 bile duct carcinomas and 6 gallbladder carcinomas) was performed. In 23 cases IPEUS was performed intraoperatively from the superior mesenteric venous route with an 8 French, 20 MHz intravascular ultrasound catheter. In 7 cases IPEUS was performed before surgery from the percutaneous transhepatic route with a 6 French, 20 MHz intravascular ultrasound catheter. The finding of IPEUS was confirmed by pathologic examination of resected specimens and surgical exploration. The results of IPEUS were compared to those of portography and CT. RESULTS: Intraportal endovascular ultrasonography visualized the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> wall as an echogenic band with a thickness of 0. 5 mm to 1. 0 mm. The diagnostic criterion <b>of</b> <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> invasion was destruction of this echogenic band. <b>Portal</b> <b>vein</b> invasion was found in 15 of 30 cases. Vascular invasion was confirmed by pathologic examination of resected specimens in 10 patients and operative findings in 5. The sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of IPEUS for diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> invasion was 100 %, 93. 3 %, and 96. 7 %, respectively. The values were 80 %, 67. 7 %, and 73. 3 % for portography and 53. 3 %, 80 %, and 66. 7 %, respectively, for CT. CONCLUSIONS: Intraportal endovascular ultrasonography provided precise information about the relationship between the pancreatobiliary tumor and the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> wall. It was capable of accurately detecting or excluding early invasion <b>of</b> the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> wall by pancreatobiliary carcinoma...|$|R
40|$|Of 176 {{patients}} with {{carcinoma of the}} pancreatic head region 156 underwent standard pancreatoduodenectomy (group 2) and 20 with macroscopic suspicion of invasion <b>of</b> the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> or superior mesenteric vein (SMV) underwent pancreatoduodenectomy with partial resection <b>of</b> the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> or SMV (group 1). In 16 patients in group 1 end-to-end anastomosis was used for reconstruction of the vein. The morbidity rate in groups 1 and 2 was similar (55 versus 63 per cent). The hospital mortality rate was 15 per cent in group 1 and 7 per cent in group 2 (P = 0. 22). Histological examination confirmed tumour invasion <b>of</b> the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> or SMV in ten patients in group 1. Invasion <b>of</b> the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> or SMV was significantly more frequent in {{patients with}} pancreatic cancer than in those with distal bile duct or ampullary carcinoma. Of the 20 patients in group 1 only three underwent curative resection with tumour-free margins. The median survival time after resection <b>of</b> the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> or SMV was 8 months; the 2 -year survival rate was 19 per cent. Comparison of survival in group 1 with survival in subgroups of patients undergoing standard pancreatoduodenectomy, matched for all histological parameters, showed no significant difference. It is concluded that partial resection <b>of</b> the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> or SMV in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy who are suspected of having tumour invasion <b>of</b> the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> or SMV does not improve either the rate of curative resection or surviva...|$|R
40|$|Proper {{knowledge}} of the anatomy of hepatobiliary vasculature and its possible variations are important for surgeons, radiologists and other clinicians. We noticed few variations in the branching pattern <b>of</b> hepatic artery, <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> and cystic artery during routine anatomy dissection classes. The variations include an additional left hepatic artery, which was found communicating with left branch <b>of</b> <b>portal</b> <b>vein,</b> and an additional cystic artery...|$|R
