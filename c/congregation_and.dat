5|$|During the Livonian War, Estonia {{became part}} of the Lutheran Swedish kingdom. The Catholic Dome Church became a church with a Lutheran <b>congregation</b> <b>and</b> was then called the Castle Church. In 1625, the Swedish King Gustav II Adolf sold the town of Haapsalu, the castle and the nearby land {{property}} to Count Jacob De la Gardie, who planned to turn the dilapidated stronghold into a modern castle.

5|$|Garrard and {{the other}} elders of the church started {{numerous}} congregations in the state, including one {{as far away as}} Mason County. In 1789, Garrard and Eastin began working to reunite the more orthodox Regular Baptists in the area with the more liberal Separatist Baptists. Garrard's former church in Virginia had been a Regular Baptist <b>congregation,</b> <b>and</b> Garrard was considered a Regular Baptist despite his clear advocacy for religious toleration and his open expression of liberal views. Although he never succeeded in uniting the two factions, he was chosen moderator of the Elkhorn Baptist Association's annual meetings in 1790, 1791, and 1795 in recognition of his efforts.|$|E
25|$|The {{establishment}} of the seminary caused a close connection between the Norwegian baptist <b>congregations</b> <b>and</b> that of the Midwestern United States.

The number of baptist congregations reached eighteen in 1886, although the membership growth was significantly steeper with 1,335 members that year. Ten years later this had increased to 26 <b>congregations</b> <b>and</b> 2,132 members. It reached 35 <b>congregations</b> <b>and</b> 2,900 members in 1902.|$|R

At the time, the property was valued at $95,000 (today $). The funds for the purchase were raised from the members of the <b>congregation,</b> <b>and</b> to honor those contributing $10 or more, names were engraved on one of four marble slabs in the stairway to the main sanctuary. The most generous gift was $500, at a time when $10 was two weeks' pay. The congregation also took out two mortgages; one for $50,000 (today $) with the Title Insurance Company, and a second for $30,000 (today $) with the Church Extension and Missionary Society.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona died {{without ever}} having {{returned}} to Madagascar, after two formal requests in 1910 and 1912 were refused on the pretext of insufficient funds in the colonial coffers.

5|$|Since the Reformation, {{the nave}} {{is that part}} of the {{building}} which is usually open to and most used by the <b>congregation</b> <b>and</b> general public. There is also, usually in the nave, a raised pulpit from which the dean or other clergy can expound the scriptures. In the late 20th century it became customary in some cathedrals for an hourly prayer to be said, for the benefit of visitors, and this is often presented from the nave pulpit. In a large cathedral, particularly in those where the building is divided by a screen as at Canterbury, an altar may be set at the eastern end of the nave so that services might be held there for large congregations. At each place where services are held there is a lectern on which rests a Bible.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church, whose {{traditional}} membership {{was most}} affected by the changes in housing, {{was the first to}} react to this situation, creating 76 new parishes between 1845 and 1960 in the west of the country alone. The Baptist and Episcopalian churches followed close behind, particularly in the new towns. Within the Church of Scotland, the closeness of <b>congregation</b> <b>and</b> clergy was expressed in the domestic plainness of 1950s dual-use hall churches, as at Reiach's Kildrum Parish Church, Cumbernauld (completed 1962), a steel framed building, clad in timber and brick with a flat roof. Of 129 buildings erected by the Church of Scotland between 1948 and 1959, 108 were on this basic pattern.|$|E

5|$|The {{church has}} six weekly services, {{one of them}} located in the Rue Battant {{especially}} for people with disabilities. Each meeting is devoted to a particular Christian practice: evangelization, prayer, Bible reading, singing, and weekly worship. Meetings are composed of biblical sermons and studies, testimonies of religious experiences, hymns, meditation, worship, and prayers. Services are dynamic, charismatic and emotional, often evolving into ecstasy and trance; glossolalia results when the pastor calls the Holy Spirit to come upon the <b>congregation,</b> <b>and</b> usually lasts 30 to 60 minutes. Women must have their heads covered during worship.|$|E

After a ten-year tenure, Dunn's son-in-law, Nathaniel Pettit, resigned in 1867 to become Sussex County's first Superintendent of Schools.
