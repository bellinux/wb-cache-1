40|$|BACKGROUND: Better {{depicting}} {{the relationship between}} antibiotic consumption and evolutionary healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) may help highlight the importance of antibiotic stewardship. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The correlations between antibiotic consumption and MDR-GNB HAIs at a 2, 700 -bed primary care and tertiary referral center in Taiwan between 2002 and 2009 were assessed. MDR-GNB HAI referred to a HAI caused by MDR-Enterobacteriaceae, MDR-Pseudomonas aeruginosa or MDR-Acinetobacter spp. <b>Consumptions</b> <b>of</b> individual antibiotics and MDR-GNB HAI series were first evaluated for trend over time. When a trend was significant, {{the presence or absence}} of associations between the selected clinically meaningful antibiotic resistance and antibiotic consumption was further explored using cross-correlation analyses. Significant major findings included (i) increased <b>consumptions</b> <b>of</b> extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminopenicillins/β-lactamase inhibitors, piperacillin/tazobactam, and fluoroquinolones, (ii) decreased <b>consumptions</b> <b>of</b> non-extended-spectrum cephalosporins, natural penicillins, aminopenicillins, ureidopenicillin and aminoglycosides, and (iii) decreasing trend in the incidence of the overall HAIs, stable trends in GNB HAIs and MDR-GNB HAIs throughout the study period, and increasing trend in HAIs caused by carbapenem-resistant (CR) Acinetobacter spp. since 2006. HAIs due to CR-Acinetobacter spp. was found to positively correlate with the <b>consumptions</b> <b>of</b> carbapenems, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminopenicillins/β-lactamase inhibitors, piperacillin/tazobactam and fluoroquinolones, and negatively correlate with the <b>consumptions</b> <b>of</b> non-extended-spectrum cephalosporins, penicillins and aminoglycosides. No significant association was found between the increased use of piperacilllin/tazobactam and increasing HAIs due to CR-Acinetobacter spp. CONCLUSIONS: The trend in overall HAIs decreased and trends in GNB HAIs and MDR-GNB HAIs remained stable over time suggesting that the infection control practice was effective during the study period, and the escalating HAIs due to CR- Acinetobacter spp. were driven by <b>consumptions</b> <b>of</b> broad-spectrum antibiotics other than piperacillin/tazobactam. Our data underscore the importance of antibiotic stewardship in the improvement of the trend of HAIs caused by Acinetobacter spp...|$|R

Changes in structures <b>of</b> rural survivable <b>consumption</b> (food, clothing, housing, and cultural entertainment) and rural enjoyable consumption (transportation and communication, household equipment and services, health care and other goods and services) are analyzed in order to discuss the structural change <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> expenditure <b>of</b> rural residents in Hebei Province, China. It is concluded that <b>consumption</b> expenditure <b>of</b> rural residents has increased year by year in Hebei Province with the enhancement <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> level and the slight reduction <b>of</b> survivable <b>consumption</b> which is mainly caused by the decline <b>of</b> food <b>consumption.</b> Meanwhile, there is a slow growth <b>of</b> enjoyable <b>consumption,</b> mainly reflected in the transportation and communication expenditure and other goods and services expenditure.

30|$|Estimation <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> {{intensity}} <b>of</b> African indigenous vegetables (AIVs) {{is important}} to understand how their utilization can be enhanced at the household level. The study evaluated <b>consumption</b> intensity <b>of</b> leafy AIVs using the zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. A multistage sampling technique was used to select a random sample of 450 rural and urban respondents, and data were collected using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire. The findings revealed that <b>consumption</b> intensity <b>of</b> leafy AIVs were higher in rural than in urban dwellers with a mean of four and two times a week, respectively. Age, occupation, household size, diversity of AIV leaves, market distance, awareness of AIV’s medicinal benefits and proportion of income allocated to food purchases significantly influenced <b>consumption</b> intensity <b>of</b> leafy AIVs. Strategies that could promote the transfer of AIVs’ traditional knowledge to uninformed consumer segments such as male and younger decision-makers could increase the <b>consumption</b> intensity <b>of</b> leafy AIVs in rural dwellers. Similarly, the <b>consumption</b> intensity <b>of</b> leafy AIVs in urban dwellers could increase through the promotion of the value addition activities of sorting and plucking vegetable leaves from their stalks before marketing. Finally, in both rural and urban dwellers, promotion of AIV diversity in food systems through diversified production and well-coordinated market supply chains could increase <b>consumption</b> intensity <b>of</b> leafy AIVs.|$|R
