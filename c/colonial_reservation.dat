40|$|This article {{examines}} historical {{trends in the}} character of forest management in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). Relying on the Socio-Economic Approach to policy analysis, the paper discusses the influence of changing socio-economic factors and power structures on forest management in pre-colonial and colonial Ghana. In so doing, the article also interrogates the real motives behind the colonial forest reservation policy in the Gold Coast. Contrary to the belief that <b>colonial</b> <b>reservation</b> policy was a ploy take the management of lucrative forest resources from local people; the paper argues that centralised forest reservation policy was adopted by the British colonial administration in response to genuine environmental concerns. Finally, the effects of colonial forest policies on forest governance in modern Ghana are discussed...|$|E
50|$|By treaty, the <b>colonial</b> {{government}} established <b>reservations</b> for the Mattaponi and Pamunkey in this area. More than 350 years later, Pamunkey and Mattaponi {{tribal members}} continue {{to occupy the}} reservations, located {{a few miles north}} of modern-day West Point. Both are state-recognized tribes, which now number eleven.|$|R
40|$|<b>Colonial</b> forest <b>reservation</b> in the Benin Division of {{southern}} Nigeria was remarkably extensive, with reserves taking up almost 65 per {{cent of the}} Division by 1937. This paper explores both the various strategies employed by the colonial government {{in order to bring}} about large scale reservation and the role of reservation in changing land politics. In doing so, it provides nuanced insights into the interaction between the colonial government and local rulers under indirect rule. It shows that both Oba Eweka II (1914 – 33) and Oba Akenzua II (1933 – 79) supported reservation for strategic reasons, but also highlights the government's many underhand tactics in dealing with the Obas...|$|R
2500|$|Cockacoeske (weroansqua of the Pamunkey), {{who succeeded}} her husband {{after he was}} killed {{fighting}} for the English, was an ally of Berkeley against Bacon. To the English, she was known as [...] "Queen of the Pamunkey". She is known for having signed the Articles of Peace (Treaty of Middle Plantation) in 1677, after Bacon's Rebellion ended. As {{a result of the}} treaty, she gained authority over the Rappahannock and Chickahominy tribes, which had not formerly been under the paramount chiefdom of the Pamunkey. Completion of the treaty ushered in a time of peace between the Virginia tribes and the English. This treaty was signed by more tribal leaders than that of 1646. It reinforced the annual tribute payments and added the Siouan and Iroquoian tribes to the Tributary Indians of the <b>colonial</b> government. More <b>reservation</b> lands were established for the tribes, but the treaty required Virginia Native American leaders to acknowledge they and their peoples were subjects of the King of England.|$|R
40|$|Imperial Fever: Tropical Medicine, British Literature, and the Return to South America, 1880 - 1930 {{explores the}} ways in which British writers engaged with the new {{developments}} in tropical medicine in their fictional representations of tropical fever in the early twentieth century. With the British Empire undergoing its largest expansion through predominantly tropical regions of the globe between 1860 and 1920, the demand for 'tropical medicine' and specialized training in 'tropical diseases' was at the utmost importance. Scottish physician and bacteriologist Ronald Ross proclaimed, "Malaria is the greatest enemy of the explorer, the missionary, the planter, the merchant, the farmer, the soldier, the administrator, the villager and the poor; and has…profoundly modified the world's history by tending to render the whole of the tropics comparatively unsuitable for the full development of civilization" (Prevention vii). Medical and scientific journals celebrated new discoveries made in tropical disease transmission and immunity, and promoted the study of tropical medicine. The opening of the tropics to British investment and re-settlement that tropical medicine now made possible captured the British imagination. The three British writers examined in Imperial Fever - Arthur Conan Doyle, Virginia Woolf, Evelyn Waugh - engage with the <b>colonial</b> optimism, <b>reservation,</b> and anxiety inspired by the medical sciences in their depictions of modern British travelers combating tropical diseases and conquering the unruly terrain and indigenous populations of South America. Imperial Fever examines {{the ways in}} which developments in tropical medicine shaped British cultural and imperial identity as a growing tropical empire {{in the early years of}} the twentieth century. 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the meeting}} {{referred}} to above, the five men also agreed that immigrants of Catholic and French origin {{should be encouraged}} to settle in the Rolanderie area. They decided {{that the best way to}} ensure the subsequent development of the St. Hubert district as a French-speaking Catholic community was to regulate the sale of homesteads. Similar <b>colonial</b> settlement <b>reservations</b> had been made in 1874 for French Canadians repatriated from the New England states, and had given rise to the establishment between 1876 and 1885 of ten new French settlements in Western Canada. Following this meeting the two aristocrats purchased fourteen quarters south of the Pipestone in Township fourteen (all of sections 31, 33 and 35 and all the east half of section 34) and fourteen quarters north of the. valley ( [...] all of sections 2 and 9, the north halves of sections 4 and 5, and the south half of section 3). This land in turn was sold to the Diocese of St. Boniface at or near cost. Once having secured the land, the January 1891 issue of The Colonist tells us, de Roffignac and Van Brabant induced a number of French families [...] "to transport themselves across the Atlantic and locate within the limits of the settlement." [...] They promised their compatriots [...] "free and comfortable homes, liberty and remunerative employment," [...] and one homestead quarter for each family-head. Partially with the business of recruiting settlers in mind, de Roffignac had returned to France in 1889. Van Brabant spent the winter of 1891 in France [...] "attending to immigration business in connection with the colony." [...] The colony soon enjoyed a large measure of success. According to Father Fallourd, eighty-eight French and Belgians arrived at Rolanderie between March 26, 1892 and October 4, 1893.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s {{onset of the}} Kakamega Gold Rush - helped contextualise to Archdeacon Owen, {{who was a member}} of Committee on Native Land Tenure in North Kavirondo Reserve (1930), the omnipotent veneration Bantu Kavirondo people (Luhya people) embraced for land as a posterity that {{extended}} throughout an indefinite generational vision of natural lineage/heredity. This was in consequence to which, not only, was the <b>colonial</b> system of <b>reservations</b> troublesome to the Bantu Kavirondo people, but then again, to implement the flawed recommendations contained in the report by Committee on Native Land Tenure in North Kavirondo Reserve — which included fiscal policy provisions that mandated land registration and corresponding registration fees and other forms of levies — was futile; the Bantu Kavirondo people viewed such stipulation as a tyrannical subjugation whose implication(s) inferred that their land — the land of their forefathers — was being claimed by the imperial and colonial authorities and their native cronies. An act which hoisted the imperial and colonial authorities and their native cronies to landlords; whereas, consigning the native Africans of North Kavirondo to a class of squatter or tenant denizens on their own lands, a feat that tradition obliged be met with perspicuous contemptuous resistance.|$|R
40|$|Studies of Native-Euroamerican {{relations}} in colonial New England {{have tended to}} emphasize the military conflicts of the seventeenth century, casting them as the definitive events of conquest. Focusing on the land struggles of reservation communities in Connecticut throughout {{the first half of}} the eighteenth century, a period of intensified colonial land hunger, this study is concerned with understanding how Native women and men continued as agents in, and interpretors of, their own histories beyond the period of military conquest. Despite the provisions of the colony 2 ̆ 7 s 1680 reservation law—which stated that reservation lands were to be preserved in perpetuity—reservations in eighteenth-century Connecticut were perpetually threatened by <b>colonial</b> encroachment; thus <b>reservation</b> boundaries became important battlegrounds, engaging reservation communities, encroachers, and government officials in contests over Native land rights, the legitimacy of colonial claims to land, and the future of reservation populations. ^ Building from the contributions of the anthropology of colonialism, this study examines the forms of domination that structured the lives of reservation communities in the eighteenth century, and investigates the relationship between resistance and cultural production in the context of Mohegans 2 ̆ 7 and Mashantucket Pequots 2 ̆ 7 legal disputes with colonists over rights to reservation land. A critical analysis of the colonial records indicates that these disputes were also cultural struggles, entailing debates over history and emergent colonial notions about the cultural “illegitimacy” of <b>reservation</b> populations. <b>Colonial</b> discourse on Indianness, particularly narrations of “Pequot conquest,” played a powerful role in legislative responses to Natives 2 ̆ 7 complaints against encroachment, and were deployed to deny Natives 2 ̆ 7 land rights and obscure Natives 2 ̆ 7 articulations of their own histories. But colonial tactics of control did not go unanswered by Native people, whose acts of resistance revealed that they were possessed of a political, and historical, consciousness which was rooted in enduring cultural ties to their homelands, and to each other. Thus while investigating the limits imposed upon <b>reservation</b> communities by <b>colonial</b> law and “Indian policy,” this study illuminates the indigenous knowledges, and local histories, that posed an important challenge to ongoing processes of conquest. ...|$|R
