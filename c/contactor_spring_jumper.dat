40|$|Abstract – In {{the present}} paper, {{a new type}} of {{electrical}} actuator, an electromagnetic force driving actuator (EMFA), applicable to air circuit breaker is developed and analyzed. Transient analysis is performed to obtain the dynamic characteristics of EMFA. The distribution of static magnetic flux is obtained using the finite element method. The coupled problems of electrics and mechanics governing equations are solved using the time-difference method. According to the interception rate of each contactor, investigation of the <b>contactor</b> <b>spring</b> load condition is conducted and applied to the three-link system. Comparisons of the dynamic characteristics of the three-link simulation and experimental data are performed...|$|R
50|$|In Victorian times, {{a legendary}} terrifying {{character}} known as 'Spring-heeled Jack' was reportedly spotted {{at a number}} of locations. The creature was often described as having blazing eyes and had the ability to leap great distances. Joe Darby, the <b>spring</b> <b>jumper</b> from Netherton supposedly started a local 'Spring-heeled Jack' scare when he was seen practising leaping over a local canal at night time, using a miner's lighted helmet to see his way.|$|R

60|$|Then, {{and neither}} was {{afterward}} {{quite sure how}} it happened, Saunders lost his balance and fell forward amidst the fern. He {{did not do it}} noiselessly, and one of the two <b>jumpers</b> <b>sprang</b> backward a pace.|$|R
50|$|The {{community}} was originally called <b>Jumpers</b> <b>Spring,</b> purportedly {{named after a}} local Creek Indian {{who lived in the}} area. A United States General Land Office opened in 1834 and remained in Mardisville until 1842. The {{community was}} renamed Mardisville in honor of Samuel Wright Mardis, who served as the land agent until his death. At one point, the community was home to a sixteen-room tavern, wood shop, tailor shop, general store, cake shop, bakery, and several churches. A post office called Mardisville was established in 1833, and remained in operation until 1881.|$|R
40|$|Beryllium is a {{naturally}} occurring element with many unique properties {{and a variety}} of uses. When combined with other elements, such as copper, specialized alloys may be made that are of particular value for certain applications. In the electrical industry copper beryllium alloys are frequently present in electrical components in the <b>contactors,</b> relays, <b>springs</b> and other metallic components. Though beryllium has many excellent physical properties and poses minimal to no human health hazard when in a solid finished form, inhaling the dust or fumes of beryllium containing materials can cause serious health issues. This project assesses whether removable beryllium surface contamination is present on four different types of electrical switchgear equipment. A total of 119 wipe samples were collected from four different styles of electrical switchgear. All wipe sample results were well below the established criteria of 0. 2 μg/ 100 cm 2. Equipment sampled and results in μg/ 100 cm 2 included Siemen Allis Contactors (CI 95 % 0. 019, 0. 029), Westinghouse Vacuum Circuit Breakers (CI 95 % 0. 014, 0. 019), Westinghouse Air Circuit Breaker (CI 95 % - 0. 009, 0. 047), and GE Power Vacuum Breaker (CI 95 % 0. 02). In addition, 6 bulk samples were collected from 6 Westinghouse Vacuum Circuit Breakers with all results below the criteria established of 2 μg/g, (CI 95 % 0. 21, 0. 46). Extensive surface beryllium contamination {{does not appear to be}} a credible concern for the pieces of electrical switchgear sampled...|$|R
40|$|Novel <b>spring</b> <b>contactors</b> were {{designed}} and characterized for wafer-level interposer and high-speed package test system applications, especially for wafer-level packages. These contactors {{can be used}} as replacement for vertical wafer probes as well as test sockets used in the final test. The contactor pin consists of a plunger section made of beryllium copper and a plated helical stainless steel spring wire. It is 5 mm in uncompressed total length, including the plunger and the spring. The overall diameter of the spring wire section was 0. 51 mm. The design of the contactor is much simpler and more scalable than that of traditional spring pins called Pogo pins used in package tests. A test socket containing 36 contactor pins was constructed for tests and measurements. The experimental characterization shows $-$ 1 -dB bandwidth of 3. 73 GHz for 0. 8 -mm pitch, measured by the direct contact method. This experimental result correlates well with the simulated results. The rise time was 82 ps as measured by TDR, and the propagation delay was 23 ps. The electrical conduction path is through the pin and the spring, making it a reliable contact. However, the electrical path is known to be through the barrel, not the spring for the regular spring pins...|$|R
60|$|The first {{fifty miles}} were passed {{over in a}} sleigh, in a few hours, and {{with little or no}} {{personal}} fatigue. This brought the travellers to a Dutch inn on the Mohawk, where the captain had often made his halts, and whither he had from time to time, sent his advanced parties {{in the course of the}} winter and <b>spring.</b> Here a <b>jumper</b> was found prepared to receive Mrs. Willoughby; and the horse being led by the captain himself, a passage through the forest was effected as far as the head of the Otsego. The distance being about twelve miles, it required two days for its performance. As the settlements extended south from the Mohawk a few miles, the first night was passed in a log cabin, on the extreme verge of civilization, if civilization it could be called, and the remaining eight miles were got over in the course of the succeeding day. This was more than would probably have been achieved in the virgin forest, and under the circumstances, had not so many of the captain's people passed over the same ground, going and returning, thereby learning how to avoid the greatest difficulties of the route, and here and there constructing a rude bridge. They had also blazed the trees, shortening the road by pointing out its true direction.|$|R
