40|$|Is a state ever truly {{insulated}} from interest group influence, or is state insulation conditional {{under the best}} of circumstances? While Huang (1995) attributes relatively low inflation in China to political discipline of the Chinese communists, the banking sector has slowly fallen into quagmire. While harsh retrenchments succeeded in lowering inflation, each monetary expansion brought the Chinese banking sector closer to bankruptcy. The central government controls the overall amount of lending and is therefore responsible for the current banking crisis. If politics is responsible for low inflation, how does it influence lending? My research, in addition to rigorously testing the conventional wisdom that state <b>controlled</b> <b>finance</b> itself leads to suboptimal allocation of capital, also investigates political pressure groups, informal factions, and electoral incentives as possible explanations of the irrational lending problem. Irrational lending here is defined as lending without assessing the commercial risk of the borrower. For the field of Chinese studies, my work will provide more empirical evidence to the debate on “reciprocal accountability, ” which will shed light on the political origins of policies in China. It also hopes to provide a causal theory of how politics influences economic outcome in China. In the field of comparative politics, my work seeks to generate a new framework of analysis for stat...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{will show}} how the Philippine Islands were {{integrated}} into British dominated trans-national networks in the China Sea between 1837 and 1869, which heavily influenced {{the historical development of}} the Spanish colony. It will focus on the role of Manila's British merchant population in helping to establish the Philippine port-capital as an important hub in this British "world-system" (Darwin). The origins of British settlement can be dated back to the 1820 s, however, this process accelerated after 1837, the year the port was formally opened to international trade. The port-capital's growing integration into a British Asian world was already hinted at by 1838, when Jardine, Matheson & Co. made plans (eventually aborted) to relocate to Manila under threat of expulsion from China. The next thirty years witnessed the Philippines' further incorporation into this British imperial politico-commercial web as European trade in the Far East mushroomed. A plethora of merchants and diplomats were attracted to the new extraterritorial acquisitions in China after victory in the 1 st Opium War (1839 - 1842). British and foreign trade with Manila also expanded rapidly through the city's relationship to these new settlements, especially Hong Kong, Europe's gateway to China. This encouraged the growth of a (predominantly) British and North American mercantile diaspora in Manila that <b>controlled</b> <b>finance,</b> shipping and foreign trade in the port. The role of these merchant congeries in binding the colony to markets and colonial polities in China, Malaysia and Australia anchored the port within a British hegemonic network that shaped trade and diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific. In the Philippine Islands this process facilitated the economic expansion, social evolution and political reconfiguration of the colony, helping redefine the colony's place in the reconfigured Spanish "Imperial archipelago" (Morillo-Alicea) that survived the dissolution of the Spanish American empire in the mid 1820 s.
