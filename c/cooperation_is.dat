5|$|Ecgbert {{was named}} to the see of York around 732 (other sources date the {{appointment}} to 734) by his cousin Ceolwulf, the king of Northumbria. Pope Gregory III gave him a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, in 735. After Eadberht became king, the brothers worked together, and were forbidden by the papacy to transfer church lands to secular control. They also worked together to deal with problems that had developed in the relationship between the church and royal government. An example of the brothers' <b>cooperation</b> <b>is</b> {{the fact that some of}} Eadberht's coins feature Ecbert's image on the opposite face.|$|E
5|$|Even {{more complex}} {{morphological}} changes are sometimes possible. For example, when starved of amino acids, Myxobacteria detect surrounding cells {{in a process}} known as quorum sensing, migrate towards each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells. In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; this type of <b>cooperation</b> <b>is</b> a simple type of multicellular organisation. For example, about one in ten cells migrate {{to the top of a}} fruiting body and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called a myxospore, which is more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Bart {{plans to}} reveal what he witnessed, but Seymour and Edna {{fear that they}} would be fired if anyone found out and they swear him to secrecy. They hire him as their gofer so they can {{secretly}} exchange messages. Bart agrees for a while because the reward for his <b>cooperation</b> <b>is</b> that Milhouse will inherit Bart's poor school record. Eventually, Bart grows frustrated about his home, school and social life continually being interrupted to help them advance their relationship, putting him in embarrassing situations. One afternoon at school, after he is embarrassed in front of his classmates by having to say one of Seymour's messages to Edna out loud, Bart bitterly gathers the entire school in front of a janitor's closet and he opens the door to reveal that Seymour and Edna are making out.|$|E

5000|$|By a {{framework}} decree of 2001, inter-municipal <b>cooperation</b> <b>was</b> reformed by the Flemish Government. A {{variety of forms}} of inter-municipal <b>cooperation</b> <b>were</b> legally implemented.

The framework insists on the [...] "purity" [...] of IMC, so municipalities shall be involved primarily.|$|R
25|$|Not all {{examples}} of mutualism are also {{examples of}} cooperation. Specifically, in by-product mutualism, both participants benefit, but <b>cooperation</b> <b>is</b> not involved. For example, when an elephant defecates, this is {{beneficial to the}} elephant {{as a way to}} empty waste, and it is also beneficial to a dung beetle that uses the elephant's dung. However, neither participant's behavior yields a benefit from the other, and thus <b>cooperation</b> <b>is</b> not taking place.|$|E
25|$|The {{second class}} of {{explanations}} for <b>cooperation</b> <b>is</b> indirect fitness benefits, or altruistic cooperation. There are three major mechanisms that generate {{this type of}} fitness benefit: limited dispersal, kin discrimination and the green-beard effect.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cooperation</b> <b>is</b> {{maintained}} {{in situations where}} free-riding is a problem through enforcement, which is the mechanism where the actor is rewarded for cooperating or punished for not cooperating. This happens when <b>cooperation</b> <b>is</b> favored in aiding those who have helped the actors in the past. Punishment for noncooperation has been documented in meerkats, where dominant females will attack and evict subordinate females who become pregnant. The pregnancy {{is seen as a}} failure to cooperate because only the dominant females are allowed to bear offspring. Dominant females will attack and kill the offspring of subordinate females if they evade eviction and eviction often leads to increased stress and decreased survival.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As a new service-oriented {{manufacturing}} paradigm, cloud manufacturing (CMfg) {{was proposed}} {{to realize the}} added-value and on-demand use of manufacturing resource and ability. Compared with cloud computing, the complexity of CMfg <b>cooperation</b> <b>was</b> analyzed. Supply and demand network of enterprises with multifunction and opening characteristics (SDN) was introduced as a new paradigm of manufacturing cooperation. Dynamic, diversity, fully open and inclusive <b>cooperation</b> <b>are</b> the key concept of SDN. The CMfg cooperation based on SDN was analyzed, from three-dimension of lever, function and space. A model of cooperation-oriented CMfg was built. Resource-oriented, service-oriented and innovation-oriented <b>cooperation</b> <b>were</b> proposed to prompt the implementation and the platform building of CMfg, from the business cooperation perspective...|$|R

25|$|Economic and {{financial}} sustainability. Can {{the results of}} technical cooperation continue to yield an economic benefit after the technical <b>cooperation</b> <b>is</b> withdrawn? For example, the benefits from {{the introduction of new}} crops may not be sustained if the constraints to marketing the crops are not resolved. Similarly, economic, as distinct from financial, sustainability may be at risk if the end users continue to depend on heavily subsidized activities and inputs.|$|E
