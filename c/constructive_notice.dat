500|$|Under {{a lesser}} standard, Moskowitz {{strongly}} rejected the vagueness argument. [...] "he fishing vessel definition here is patently broad on its face," [...] he wrote. [...] "So broad, in fact, that an ordinary person of reasonable intelligence {{would think that}} the KD IIs activities would probably be included in the blanket fishing vessel definition rather than exempt from it ...

[...] "A reasonable person in the shark fin business would be aware of the SFPA's application to the KD IIs activities." ...|$|E
500|$|Some authors place fully {{secret and}} half-secret trusts in {{different}} categories, including Alastair Hudson and Lionel Astor Sheridan. To this {{it has been}} argued that, if the [...] "outside the will" [...] theory is the true basis for the secret trust, whether the mention of the existence of the trust {{on the face of the}} will should affect its nature. In Hudson's opinion, fully secret trusts are constructive trusts, because they exist to prevent fraud. But sometimes they are express trusts, if [...] "au dehor" [...] doctrine is concerned. Half-secret trusts are constructive trust, because their mention in wills makes fraud unlikely; they are instead in line with a <b>constructive</b> <b>notice,</b> e.g. the use of sealed document. The House of Lords in Blackwell v Blackwell, however, considered the half-secret trust to have the same basis as the fully secret trust.|$|E

5000|$|The Tea Rose-Rectanus {{doctrine}} or remote, good-faith user {{doctrine is}} a common law rule of United States trademark law that determines the geographic scope of rights. The doctrine allows a junior user of a mark that is geographically remote from the senior user of the mark to establish priority over a senior users claim to the mark in the junior users area. [...] The <b>constructive</b> use and <b>notice</b> sections of the Lanham Act limited the applicability of this doctrine.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} cases {{demonstrate the}} need for standardized treatment of the IRS {{in relation to a}} state’s recording requirements, especially when dealing with an unrecorded divorce decree. While state law defines what interest a taxpayer retains after such conveyance, this Note suggests that future courts should adopt the majority approach when determining what interest the IRS acquires after issuance of a § 6321 tax lien on a taxpayer’s real property. This Note begins, in Part II, by discussing the major cases in the circuit courts that have led to this dispute, along with the recent IRS General Counsel Memorandum which has reignited the conflict. Then in section III. A, this Note demonstrates that a § 6321 tax lien should only attach to the interests of the taxpayer and not to the interests of the taxpayer’s creditors. In section III. B, this Note analyzes the application and purpose of state recording acts when integrated with a federal tax lien. Next, in section III. C, this Note argues against a court’s treatment of the IRS as a creditor without notice. That section further discusses a possible undeveloped argument that a docketed divorce decree dividing interest in property should qualify as <b>constructive</b> or inquiry <b>notice</b> upon the IRS when a tax lien arises. The Note concludes, in section III. D, with suggestions of judicial and legislative solutions to standardize the treatment of the IRS in tax lien proceedings with regards to conveyances contained in unrecorded divorce decrees...|$|R
2500|$|The {{appeal was}} {{dismissed}} on 2 April 1996, and permission {{to appeal to}} the House of Lords was refused. Lord Justice Russell rejected T's claim that they could not have known of the dangers before 1933 and said: [...] "The true date was much earlier, certainly long before Mr Margereson's birth date [...] His activities as a child, therefore, as well as Mrs Hancock's, were {{at a time when the}} defendants were on actual or <b>constructive</b> <b>notice</b> as to the potential pulmonary damage that exposure to asbestos dust could bring about." ...|$|E
50|$|Another use of <b>constructive</b> <b>notice</b> {{is in the}} {{recording}} of deeds, mortgages, liens, and similar documents in county registries in the United States. Since such documents are considered public information and can be accessed by {{any member of the}} public, such recordings are considered <b>constructive</b> <b>notice</b> of land conveyances or encumbrances having taken place.|$|E

50|$|Actual notice may be {{contrasted with}} <b>constructive</b> <b>notice,</b> {{which is a}} way of giving notice that may not {{immediately}} bring the matter {{to the attention of the}} individual that is intended to receive the notice. <b>Constructive</b> <b>notice</b> includes, among other methods, service on an agent or family member, service by posting (on the front door), and service by publication (as in a newspaper).|$|E
50|$|The New York City Housing Court allows use of {{the concept}} of <b>constructive</b> <b>notice</b> by either the tenant or the {{landlord}}. For example, <b>constructive</b> <b>notice</b> could be given to a landlord if a broken and unsupported metal grate on a public sidewalk collapses when stepped on by a pedestrian. The landlord is reasonably expected to know that this is a safety hazard.|$|E

50|$|<b>Constructive</b> <b>notice</b> {{as opposed}} to actual notice is {{insufficient}} under American law to inform a person living in another state except for cases affecting the personal status of an American plaintiff (like divorce) or cases that are in rem, in which the property sought is {{within the boundaries of}} the state and the law presumes that property is always in the possession of the owner, and the owner, therefore, knows what happens to the property. Thus, attachment of the property before judicial proceedings makes <b>constructive</b> <b>notice</b> sufficient.|$|E
50|$|The Prentice Report (1986) {{led to the}} Companies Act 1989. This {{recommended}} abolishing <b>constructive</b> <b>notice</b> {{and that}} actions of a company could not be called into question for lack of capacity, but still no ultra vires abolition.|$|E

50|$|Notice is {{the legal}} concept {{describing}} a requirement that a party be aware of legal process affecting their rights, obligations or duties. There are several types of notice: public notice (or legal notice), actual notice, <b>constructive</b> <b>notice,</b> and implied notice.|$|E
50|$|Use-based {{rights are}} less certain than registration, and {{depend on the}} mark having {{developed}} a reputation in the region in which a company seeks to enforce its common-law trade mark.

50|$|Even {{though a}} {{recording}} act {{does not require}} recordation, the law does create strong incentive for a buyer to record. Recordation provides <b>constructive</b> <b>notice</b> to any subsequent purchasers that a prior conveyance occurred and therefore protects the prior purchaser {{in the event of}} a subsequent conveyance.|$|E
5000|$|In {{companies}} law {{the doctrine}} of <b>constructive</b> <b>notice</b> is a doctrine where all persons dealing with a company are deemed (or [...] "construed") to have knowledge of the company's articles of association and memorandum of association. The doctrine of indoor management is an exception to this rule.|$|E
50|$|A {{successor}} of the promisor {{is bound}} if the original promise is in writing, the covenanting parties intended the servitude {{to be enforceable}} by and against assignees, the successor of the promisor has actual, inquiry (record), or <b>constructive</b> <b>notice</b> of the servitude, and the covenant touches and concerns the land.|$|E
50|$|The {{articles}} were registered with Companies House {{so there was}} <b>constructive</b> <b>notice.</b> But the bank {{could not have known}} about the resolution, as they were not registrable and thus were not a public document. The bond was held valid and there was no requirement to know the company's internal workings.|$|E
50|$|However, it is {{sometimes}} possible for an outsider to ascertain whether an internal requirement or procedure has been complied with. If {{it is possible to}} ascertain this fact from the company's public documents, the doctrine of disclosure and the doctrine of <b>constructive</b> <b>notice</b> will apply and not the Turquand rule. The Turquand rule was formulated to keep an outsider's duty to inquire into the affairs of a company within reasonable bounds, but if the compliance or non-compliance with an internal requirement can be ascertained from the company's public documents, the doctrine of disclosure and the doctrine of <b>constructive</b> <b>notice</b> will apply. If it is an internal requirement that a certain act should be approved by special resolution, the Turquand rule will therefore not apply in relation to that specific act, since a special resolution is registered with Companies House (in the United Kingdom), and is deemed to be public information.|$|E
50|$|In essence, the Federal Register {{is a way}} for the {{government}} to announce changes to government requirements, policies and guidance to the public. The notice and comment process, as outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act, gives the people a chance to participate in agency rulemaking.

50|$|In Belmont Finance Corp Ltd v Williams Furniture (No 2) it {{was held}} thatfraud/dishonesty not required, i.e. {{negligence}} would suffice.

5000|$|The {{harshness}} of {{the doctrine}} of <b>constructive</b> <b>notice</b> is somewhat reduced by the [...] "Rule of Indoor management" [...] or [...] "Turquand's Rule". The Rule derives its name from the case of Royal British Bank v Turquand, where the defendant was the liquidator of the insolvent Cameron's Coalbrook Steam, Coal and Swansea and Loughor Railway Company. The company had borrowed from Royal British Bank by giving a bond worth £2,000.|$|E

5000|$|A deed {{of trust}} is {{normally}} recorded with the recorder or county clerk {{for the county}} where the property is located as evidence of and security for the debt. The act of recording provides <b>constructive</b> <b>notice</b> {{to the world that}} the property has been encumbered. [...] When the debt is fully paid, the beneficiary is required by law to promptly direct the trustee to transfer the property back to the trustor by reconveyance, thus releasing the security for the debt.|$|E
5000|$|Where a {{creditor}} takes security from {{a company}} for the indebtedness, that security can be registered against the company in the register of registered charges maintained by the Registrar of Companies. The process is relatively quick and cheap; {{it can be done}} online, and the filing fee is US$100. Once registered, the security will take priority over all subsequently registered security and any unregistered security. [...] Registration of a security interest will also constitute <b>constructive</b> <b>notice</b> of the security interest.|$|E
5000|$|Royal British Bank v Turquand (1856) 6 E&B 327 is a UK {{company law}} case that held people {{transacting}} with companies {{are entitled to}} assume that internal company rules are complied with, {{even if they are}} not. This [...] "indoor management rule" [...] or the [...] "Rule in Turquand's Case" [...] is applicable in most of the common law world. It originally mitigated the harshness of the <b>constructive</b> <b>notice</b> doctrine, and in the UK it is now supplemented by the Companies Act 2006 sections 39-41.|$|E
50|$|Under {{a notice}} statute, a {{subsequent}} {{purchaser for value}} wins if, {{at the time of}} conveyance, that subsequent purchaser had no actual or <b>constructive</b> <b>notice</b> of the prior conveyance. In short, a subsequent bona fide purchaser wins. Thus, if Oscar purports to sell a piece of land to Al for $100,000, and the next day purports to sell exactly the same piece of land to Bob for another $100,000, then Bob will own the land so long as he was not aware of the prior sale to Al. However, note that if Al records his interest before Bob's purchase, this recordation will be deemed to give Bob <b>constructive</b> <b>notice.</b> If Bob purchases the land without notice, and Al then records his prior purchase before Bob records his own purchase, then Bob will still prevail in ownership of the land. The benefit of a pure notice statute is that it encourages Al to record quickly, but if Al records after Bob's purchase, Bob has only limited incentive to record his conveyence immediately. This can leave the land records incomplete for an indeterminate amount of time and could cause Al to make improvements of which he might be divested by Bob's later recorded deed.|$|E
