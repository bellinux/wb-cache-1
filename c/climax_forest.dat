5|$|Below {{the tree}} line there are several zones of <b>climax</b> <b>forest.</b> Birch dominates {{to the west and}} north, Scots Pine with Birch and oak in the eastern Highlands and oak (both Quercus robur and Q. petrea) with Birch in the Central Lowlands and Borders. Much of the Scottish {{coastline}} consists of machair, a fertile dune pasture land formed as sea levels subsided after the last ice age. Machairs have received considerable ecological and conservational attention, chiefly because of their unique ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} ecological zones, {{with their}} progression from shoreline to <b>climax</b> <b>forest,</b> are a classic {{illustration of the}} concept of ecological succession. Much of this progression is due to the changing nature of Presque Isle and its shifting shoreline and dunes. The shoreline, the second zone, is formed by wave action and is in equilibrium between erosion and deposition, with the initial plants stabilizing the sand of the new shoreline. The newly formed sandy plain and the ponds formed in it are the third zone. The ponds start as trapped pockets of lake water and can erode away or be filled by wind-blown sand or drifting dunes. The new ponds provide habitat for plants and animals: for example, the state park is home to 89 species of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and Lepidoptera, including 35 different butterflies, as well as 84 different sorts of spiders.|$|E

There is no evidence that they settled or grew crops in the region.|$|E
25|$|Black spruce, jack pine, {{trembling}} aspen, white birch, white spruce, balsam poplar, and {{balsam fir}} are the dominant {{trees in the}} area. A prominent forest form {{in this part of}} the black spruce distribution is the black spruce/feathermoss <b>climax</b> <b>forest,</b> which characteristically exhibits moderately dense canopy and features a forest floor of feathermosses. Moose, beaver, muskrat, snowshoe hare, as well as numerous predators roam this area, including marten, ermine, fisher, otter, black bear, wolf, and lynx. The many wetlands and lakes support a diversity of bird species, such as great blue herons, ducks, geese, and that symbol of the north, the common loon. Ground and tree dwelling birds are also plentiful, including grouse, partridge, robins, blue jays, and gray jays as well as birds of prey such as hawks.|$|E
25|$|Hickories are {{consistently}} {{present in the}} broad eastern upland <b>climax</b> <b>forest</b> association commonly called oak-hickory, {{but they are not}} generally abundant (18). Locally, hickories may make up to 20 to 30 percent of stand basal area, particularly in slope and cove forests below the escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau (23) and in second-growth forests in the Cumberland Mountains, especially on benches (14). It has been hypothesized that hickory will replace chestnut (Castanea dentata) killed by the blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) in the Appalachian Highlands (10,12). On Beanfield Mountain in Giles County, Virginia, the former chestnut-oak complex has changed to an oak-hickory association over a period of 50 years. This association is dominated by pignut hickory with an importance value of 41.0 (maximum value = 300), northern red oak (36.0), and chestnut oak (25.0). White oak, red maple (Acer rubrum), and sugar maple are subdominant species.|$|E

500|$|According to the DCNR, {{because it}} has so [...] "many unique habitats, Presque Isle {{contains}} {{a greater number of}} the state's endangered, threatened and rare species than any other area of comparable size in Pennsylvania." [...] The DCNR recognizes seven different ecological zones within Presque Isle State Park, each with a different plant and animal community. These zones are: Lake Erie; the beaches and shoreline; sandy plain and ponds; sand dunes and ridges; marshes and old ponds; heath and sub-climax forest; and the <b>climax</b> <b>forest.</b> Lake Erie, which surrounds the park, is the first zone and is home to 80 species of fish and at least six species of crustaceans.|$|E
500|$|The {{sixth and}} seventh {{ecological}} zones {{are characterized by}} their shrubs and trees, and Presque Isle State Park is home to 633plant species (195monocotyledons, 410dicotyledons, 5gymnosperms, 5horsetails, 13ferns, and 5mosses). The sixth zone, thicket and sub-climax forest, forms when shrubs grow on dying marshes, followed by small trees. The trees shade and thin out the thickets of shrubs, leading to a sub-climax forest. The seventh and final stage is <b>climax</b> <b>forest,</b> where many large trees form a canopy.

40|$|ABSTRACT] We {{have been}} trying to {{establish}} an international network system of a long term monitoring for the purpose of understanding global environment change from a forestry point of view. The <b>climax</b> <b>forests</b> in Japan, especially those protected in Forest Biosphere Reserves are very precious, because they have been formed {{as the result of the}} balance which have lasted quite a long time between the forests and the surroundings. These forests not only hold various kinds of creatures but also show ecological activities which will directly reflect the changes of natural condition such as temperature and precipitation. Therefore, it will be possible to comprehensively estimate those changes by observing the phenological aspect of <b>climax</b> <b>forests</b> for a long period of time. In order to do so, however, the following procedures may be essential: Collecting the forest condition data through aerial photographs and field surveys; Making database for collected data; Long term observation using satellite; and International collaborations. It is expected to make it possible to estimate the effects on the land ecosystem, such as of global warming which is predicted to be unevenly distributed on the earth...|$|R

50|$|Phasmids are herbivorous, feeding {{mostly on}} the leaves of trees and shrubs, and a {{conspicuous}} component of many neotropical (South American) systems. Phasmatodea have been postulated as dominant light-gap herbivores there. Their role in the forest ecosystem is considered important by many scientists, who stress the significance of light gaps in maintaining succession and resilience in <b>climax</b> <b>forests.</b> The presence of phasmids lowers the net production of early successional plants by consuming them and then enriches the soil by defecation.

50|$|Conifers {{dominate}} the <b>climax</b> <b>forests</b> {{of the coast}} Douglas-fir. All of the climax conifers that grow alongside Douglas-fir can live for centuries, with a few species capable of living for over a millennium. Forests that exist on this time scale experience the type of sporadic disturbances that allow mature stands of Douglas-fir to establish themselves as a persistent element within a mature old-growth forest. When old growth forests survive in a natural state, they often look like a patchwork quilt of different forest communities. Western hemlock typically dominate oldgrowth rainforests, but contain sections of Douglas-firs, redcedar, alder, and even redwood forests on their southern extent, near the Oregon and California border, while Sitka spruce increases in frequency with latitude.|$|R

After fire, spruce and fir may reinvade a site directly, follow invasion by aspen, or follow invasion by lodgepole pine, the pathway depending {{on a combination of}} physical and biotic factors. In other cases, succession begins with long-established meadows which do not owe their existence to fire.

40|$|Vegetation {{dynamics}} of three forest communities were studied by resampling of relevés {{recorded in the}} 1970 s in the Bohemian Forest (Šumava Mountains). Results of multivariate analysis (RDA) confirmed significant time changes in species composition of the climax (Calamagrostio-Piceetum) and waterlogged (Bazzanio-Piceetum) spruce forests. The changes in the sphagnum-rich waterlogged spruce forests (Sphagno-Piceetum) {{are close to the}} level of significance. The main vegetation changes are represented by a decrease in cover and/or frequency of hygrophilous or sciophilous species (e. g. Athyrium distentifolium, Oxalis acetosella) in <b>climax</b> spruce <b>forests,</b> and an abundant increase of species, indicating a preference to drier stands or better light conditions (e. g.

Anthoxanthum odoratum, Festuca rubra or Luzula multiflora) in the newly recorded relevés from waterlogged forests. Analysis of species number per plot showed a remarkable shift to species-rich communities, especially in waterlogged stands. We tried to find the possible factors responsible for the observed changes. Unfortunately, only indirect measurement of environmental factors using Ellenberg’s indicator values could be used and did not yield sufficient results. Thus, the changes observed in <b>climax</b> spruce <b>forests</b> were ascribed mainly to a decrease in canopy cover, which was directly estimated. In waterlogged forests, a complex of several general factors, which influence the <b>climax</b> spruce <b>forest,</b> had to be taken into account...|$|R
