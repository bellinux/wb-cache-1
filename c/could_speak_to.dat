25|$|Unlike many senior generals of the era, Smith-Dorrien <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> {{troops with}} ease and was greatly admired by regimental officers. In prewar {{training}} he wanted “individual initiative and intelligence” in British soldiers. He later wrote: “one could never become an up-to-date {{soldier in the}} prehistoric warfare to be met with against the Dervishes”.|$|E
25|$|Harvey and Bryant's {{father were}} now dead, {{and he became}} {{increasingly}} lonely. From 1993 to late 1995, he visited various overseas countries fourteen times and a summary of his domestic airline travel filled three pages. He hated the destinations he travelled to, as he found that people there avoided him {{just as they did}} in Tasmania. However, he enjoyed the flights, as he <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> the people sitting adjacent to him who {{had no choice but to}} be polite. Bryant later took great joy in describing some of the more successful conversations he had with fellow passengers.|$|E

25|$|The future scholar {{also had}} a younger sister, Elena (Eliana). According to Gane, she and Udriște were the most educated of Radu's children, being taught {{to read and write}} in Church Slavonic and Koine Greek, and being {{introduced}} to art and history. Their father also displayed an interest in Renaissance literature; he had confiscated or bought a copy of Thomas à Kempis' The Imitation of Christ, in the Latin, while fighting a war in Moldavia. Helped by a private tutor, Udriște used that same book to learn Latin, which he <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> perfection. In addition to Latin, Slavonic and Greek, Udriște was fluent in Russian. Some authors have suggested that Năsturel also attended school in Kiev Voivodeship, but this is not attested by any contemporary source.|$|E
25|$|On 15 May 1786, Mavrogenes reached Văcăreşti, near Bucharest, and on 17 May he was ceremoniously crowned {{and settled}} at the princely {{residence}} of Curtea Nouă. One {{of his first}} decrees was issued four days later, when he announced that {{all the people of}} Wallachia could address their grievances directly to him. He even set up a gazebo in Târgul de afară (Obor), so that peasants <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him. He also attempted to erect stakes on all major crossroads, to show the people what would happen to them if they engaged in theft or murder, or if they failed to attend church services. During the same year, he ordered the building of an aqueduct, which, although completed, was destroyed during the conflicts that followed his rule, and never fully rebuilt.|$|E
25|$|After {{leading the}} club to victory in the League Cup and relegation from the Premier League in 2010–11, Alex McLeish {{unexpectedly}} resigned on 12 June, having already made two signings and with another two players close to {{an agreement with the}} club. He was immediately linked with the managerial vacancy at Aston Villa. Acting chairman Peter Pannu threatened to report Villa to the League for making an illegal approach to McLeish, and insisted that they <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him only if they agreed to pay the £5.4million compensation due under the terms of his contract. On 17 June, McLeish was appointed manager of Aston Villa. The matter was finally settled on 11 July, when the clubs issued a joint statement confirming that Villa would pay an undisclosed amount in compensation, all proposed legal action would cease, and coach Peter Grant and medical officer Dr Ian McGuinness would be free to follow McLeish to his new club. Chris Hughton, who had led Newcastle United to the Championship title in 2010, was appointed manager on 21 June. He confirmed that promotion back to the Premier League, rather than progress in the Europa League, was his main objective for the season, and brought Paul Trollope in to replace Andy Watson as first-team coach.|$|E

Chi's critical reception has been mostly positive, with reviewers calling her [...] "cute". In addition to Chobits, she is also a crossover character in the series [...] and is referenced in other works.|$|E
500|$|About 90 Malagasy {{remained}} on the ship throughout the following week, waiting for the promised signal fires and growing increasingly impatient. Some of the mutineers decided to build a raft to carry them to the shore {{in an effort to}} establish exactly where they were. In a stroke of luck for the crew, they encountered a black shepherd, but he ran away before they <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him; believing that they were indeed in Madagascar, they returned to the ship. Meanwhile, the surviving crew members were becoming desperate; having observed that the ocean current was setting onshore, and knowing of the arrangements for signal fires, they wrote messages asking for Dutchmen on land to light three fires on the shore to deceive the Malagasy on the ship into believing they were close to home rather than in a [...] "Christian country", and to guard them [...] "should the ship run aground".|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} the {{settlement}} of the Chandler's lawsuit was announced on January 25, 1994, L.A. District Attorney Gil Garcetti announced he supported amending a law that prohibits forcing {{people who say they}} have been sexually assaulted to testify in criminal proceedings. The amendment introduced into the state assembly the week of February 7 would have immediately allowed Garcetti to compel Jordan to testify. Around that time, Santa Barbara police interviewed the 13-year-old son of one of Jackson's former maids (who had told them her son had spent time with Jackson) and then arranged for him to see a therapist after he repeatedly denied being abused. [...] In a deposition, his mother stated when she asked the police about who she <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> about her concerns about their meetings and phone conversations with her son without her present, they arranged for her and her son to see separate therapists. On April 11, 1994, the grand jury session in Santa Barbara was extended for an additional 90-day term to allow Sneddon to gather more evidence and prosecution sources admitted to being frustrated in their grand jury probe, failing to find direct evidence of the molestation charges. The final grand jury ultimately disbanded without ever returning an indictment against Jackson.|$|E

500|$|Alex Thompson, the episode's sound recordist, {{arranged}} the phones {{so that the}} actors <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> each other in real-time. Pemberton and Shearsmith wanted this so that the voices {{would not have to}} be recorded in a studio later and added in ADR. The voice of [...] "Chloe"—the identity of whom is key to the story—presented a particular technical challenge, as the writers wanted to ensure that her identity was not revealed the first time her voice is heard. First, the production team recorded Shearsmith playing George-as-Chloe, and then a number of actresses recorded their versions of Shearsmith playing George-as-Chloe. Of these, one—Hall—was chosen to lend her voice to Chloe. Shearsmith then re-recorded his voice, imitating Hall's version of George-as-Chloe. Hall and Shearsmith's respective performances of George-as-Chloe could then be merged together for the final episode. The first time viewers hear [...] "Chloe", her voice is mostly Hall's; as the episode progresses, more of Shearsmith's voice is audible. For Shearsmith, this did not represent the production team cheating the viewers, as viewers' experiences are filtered through Andy's experiences. The first time viewers hear Chloe, they—like Andy—experience her as a teenage girl. As most of the episode was filmed in real-time, George is visible making calls as Chloe, meaning that he hides in plain sight. Footage of Shearsmith playing George-as-Chloe in George's office—used in the final episode—was filmed separately {{to the rest of the}} episode, as a camera set-up in George's office would have been visible on one of the main cameras.|$|E
500|$|Jones {{had been}} {{attracted}} to the Methodist faith because it advocated teetotalism and that the Indians must convert to the white settler lifestyle. [...] In June 1823, he attended a camp-meeting of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Ancaster Township, along with his half-sister Mary. [...] The camp-meeting touched Jones, who converted there to Christianity. [...] At this time Reverend William Case saw the potential to convert the Mississauga Indians through Jones. Case soon {{assumed the role of}} a mentor to Jones as a missionary. [...] As Jones was bilingual and bicultural, he <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> and relate to the Mississaugas and the white Christian settlers in Upper Canada. [...] Later that year, Reverend Alvin Torry set up a congregation centered around Jones and Chief Thomas Davis (Tehowagherengaraghkwen) composed entirely of Indian members. [...] The pair encouraged converted Indians to settle around Davis' home, which acquired the name [...] "Davis' Hamlet" [...] or [...] "Davisville". [...] Jones and Seth Crawford taught Sunday school for the growing community, which began building a chapel in the spring of 1824. [...] Many of Jones' relatives were quickly converted and moved to Davis' Hamlet, including his mother Tuhbenahneequay, her daughter Wechikiwekapawiqua and Chief Wageezhegome (Wegiizhigomi, [...] "Who Possesses the Day"), Wechikiwekapawiqua's husband and Jones' uncle Joseph Sawyer (Nawahjegezhegwabe (Nawajii-giizhigwabi, [...] "He who Rests Sitting upon the Sky")). [...] Jones received his first official position in the church [...] exhorter [...] on March 1, 1825. [...] In this role, he spoke at services after local preachers and assisted travelling preachers during their circuit rides. [...] Church officials including Torry and Case recognised the need for a member fluent in Ojibwe who could translate hymns and bible passages, and present the Christian religion to the Indians in terms they could understand. [...] Jones was put to work as a teacher at the Grand River mission. [...] Around this time he began speaking to groups about Methodism. [...] In 1824, a few of his relatives came to see him speak and stayed at the Grand River mission so they could enroll their children in Jones' day school. [...] The Methodists of Upper Canada commissioned Jones, along with his brother John, to begin translating religious and instructive works in Ojibwe for use in the Methodists' schools. [...] In 1825, over half his band had converted to Christianity, and Jones decided to devote his life to missionary work.|$|E

They were arrested, and Lizana ordered them brought to Mexico City so that he <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> them. The conspirators proposed to the viceroy (as related by Michelena) to form a junta to govern New Spain {{in the name of}} King Ferdinand VII and to take all possible measures to extend the reign of this [...] "august" [...] sovereign. Lizana found no criminal offense in the conspirators, and ordered them set free, to the great disgust of the pro-Spanish party.|$|E
2500|$|Hypatia has {{its roots}} in the Society for Women in Philosophy (SWIP). One of SWIP's {{earliest}} ideas was that it would establish a philosophy journal. The thought of [...] "a journal of our own" [...] was very powerful, according to Kathryn Morgan [...] (University of Toronto) speaking in 2009. Female philosophers needed a home where they <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> each other, one that was [...] "relatively safe from a critical point of view". Women's Studies International Forum agreed to publish the new journal as an annual [...] "piggy back" [...] issue of its own, which it did for three years, and distributed 10,000 brochures to its mailing list advertising the new journal.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{published}} these discourses {{by himself}} in the usual edition of 525 copies with only 175 sold by 1847. A second edition was published in 1875. He had already finished his Concluding Postscript and delivered it to Luno, his printer, by December 1845. The Corsair Affair occupied some of his time and caused him some anxiety after 1845. Later, February 7, 1846, {{he wrote in his}} diary [...] "it is now my intention to qualify as a pastor. For several months I have been praying to God to help me ..." [...] He didn't want to preach in a huge church but rather in a small church where he <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> the single individual. He had already preached one sermon at Trinitatis Church in Copenhagen on February 24, 1844 so he has some experience but is still full of imaginative constructions.|$|E

2500|$|Several groups {{sought to}} {{intervene}} as plaintiffs, including the groups who had prosecuted the In re Marriage Cases and Strauss v. Horton actions. San Francisco also {{filed a motion}} {{to intervene in the}} case. The City cited its work in the earlier cases that had provided [...] "extensive evidence and proposed findings on strict scrutiny factors and factual rebuttals to long claimed justifications for marriage discrimination". City Attorney Dennis Herrera said that his office is [...] "singularly well-prepared" [...] to help [...] "put anti-gay discrimination on trial based on the facts". Walker permitted only San Francisco to intervene, as it <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> the impact of Proposition 8 on local governments. He also ordered the attorney general to assist San Francisco in analyzing Proposition 8's impact. Walker stated that necessary speed and swiftness [...] "on an issue of this magnitude and importance" [...] were required and that the intervention of additional groups would only complicate and stall the case.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1995 the Garvaghy Road Residents Coalition (GRRC) was formed, {{comprising}} {{representatives from}} the DFJG and the tenants' associations. Its main goal was to divert Orange marches away from Garvaghy Road through peaceful means. It held peaceful protests, petitioned the police and government ministers, and tried to draw media attention to the dispute. The GRRC held regular public meetings with residents. There were usually about 12 representatives on the committee at any one time. According to one of its members, Joanne Tennyson, [...] "Although the GRRC <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> anyone they wanted, {{at the end of}} the day no-one in the committee had the right to say we would do anything, not even [...] the spokesman. The community had to agree as a whole and that was the purpose of holding public meetings". The GRRC's first secretary and spokesman was Father Eamon Stack, a Jesuit priest and DFJG member who had lived in the area since 1993. Stack emphasized that the GRRC was non-sectarian and was not connected to any political parties. He would remain its spokesman until after July 1997.|$|E
2500|$|In 1935, New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia {{attended}} {{the opening of}} the inaugural exhibit at the Federal Art Project Gallery, accompanied by Audrey McMahon, New York regional director for the Works Progress Administration/Federal Art Project. Among the works on display was Abstraction, a sketch by Swinden; it was the design for a mural planned for the College of the City of New York. A newspaper account described it as consisting of [...] "brightly colored T-squares, triangles and rulers in horizontal, vertical and diagonal positions". La Guardia [...] asked what it was, and upon being told it was a mural design, he said he didn't know what it depicted. Someone joked that it could be a map of Manhattan. The displeased mayor stated that [...] "if that's art, I belong to Tammany Hall." [...] (Tammany Hall, which the Republican mayor referenced, was the New York Democratic Party political society.) Fearing that the mayor's negative attitude could jeopardize the future of abstract art within the Federal Art Project, McMahon dispatched an assistant to summon an artist who <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> the mayor in defense of abstraction. The assistant returned with Arshile Gorky.|$|E
