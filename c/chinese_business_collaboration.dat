The purpose of this research is to find the factors that influence firm level trust in Australia and China. Methodology- This paper used quantitative research method to examine the key determinants of trust in Australian and <b>Chinese</b> <b>business</b> <b>collaborations.</b> Qualitative face-to-face interviews are also conducted in Australia and China to examine the results and provide complimentary support for the quantitative research results. Findings- Trust is influenced by different factors in <b>business</b> <b>collaboration</b> in different countries. Communication and contact person are vital to firm level trust in both China and Australia. However, the size and reputation of partner firm play more important role in business trust in Australia. Culture similarity plays significant role in <b>Chinese</b> <b>business</b> trust relationships but Australian. Value- The findings extend our knowledge on firm level trust in <b>business</b> <b>collaborations.</b> It distinguished the differences of key determinants for firm level trust in Australia and China...|$|R

Firms increasingly rely on collaborations to access new resources, new technology, skills, the latest market information, new markets and knowledge, and also to increase innovation, reduce costs and remain competitive in domestic and international markets. The motivation {{of this paper is}} to analyze the importance of <b>collaboration</b> as a <b>business</b> competitiveness strategy and to identity key factors enhancing its likelihood of success in the Chinese market for both domestic and foreign owned firms operating in China. This study will shed light on how collaboration can be used by foreign firms or Chinese firms to increase their likelihood of success and the factors most likely to lead to success. Firms operating in the telecommunications and related industries are the focus of this study, as this sector is a good microcosm of the overall Chinese economy due to the rapidly changing and dynamic nature of this sector. Our results show that firm size, trust and quality of communication play a significant role in the success of <b>Chinese</b> <b>business</b> <b>collaborations.</b> Bigger firms in China tend to have more successful collaborations in China, but this result does not hold for foreign firms in China. To collaborate successfully with Chinese firms, foreign firms also need to learn and adopt the different communication platforms in China and understand the different needs from different sized partners in China...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{implicit}} but commonly held assumption that <b>Chinese</b> <b>businesses</b> are distinctively <b>Chinese.</b> Casting them in unitary and national terms, this assumption has often provided the underpinnings for {{the conception of}} the strength of <b>Chinese</b> <b>businesses</b> as signs of an emerging China threat. Drawing on a global production networks (GPN) approach, this paper aims to question the assumption by arguing that many <b>Chinese</b> <b>businesses,</b> embedded in the expanding global and regional production networks, have taken on important transnational characteristics. Given these transnational connections, <b>Chinese</b> <b>business</b> networks in both 2 ̆ 7 Greater China 2 ̆ 7 and China proper are characterized more by diversity and fragmentation than by cultural coherence and homogeneity.

Therefore, verification mechanism based on access policies is critical for managing secured message processing in <b>business</b> <b>collaboration.</b> In this paper, we exploit a role authorization model, Role-Net, which is developed based on Hierarchical Colored Petri Nets (HCPNs) to specify and manage role authorization in <b>business</b> <b>collaboration.</b> A property named Role Authorization Based Dead Marking Freeness is defined based on Role-Net to verify <b>business</b> <b>collaboration</b> reliability according to partners’ authorization policies.

40|$|<b>Business</b> <b>collaboration</b> {{is about}} {{cooperation}} between organisations by linking their business processes and exchanging messages. Collaborative business process development requires loose coupling between individual business processes {{so that they}} can interact freely across the internet; and that the collaboration can be established in a highly dynamic fashion and on-demand basis. Unfortunately, the current web service development and management solutions including the de facto standard Business Process Execution Language for Web Service (WS-BPEL) are too narrowly focused and not capable of addressing the requirements of <b>business</b> <b>collaboration</b> that demand agility and dynamics. To remedy this situation, we advocate an approach in which rules are used to develop and maintain the <b>business</b> <b>collaboration.</b> We first introduce a <b>Business</b> <b>Collaboration</b> Context Framework (BCCF), which provides enterprises with the context required for <b>business</b> <b>collaboration.</b> We then show how enterprises can capture this context via a modelling process.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{debate on the}} contribution and significance of firm size to the establishment, operation and success of <b>business</b> <b>collaboration.</b> One important source of this debate arises from differing definitions of firm size used in previous research. This paper uses firm size categories and size differences between collaborating firms to examine their contribution to the formation and performance of inter-firm collaboration in Australia and China. Both qualitative case study and quantitative data analyses are adopted in this paper. Results from both the qualitative case study and quantitative study in Australia and China show that size plays a significant positive role in the formation and performance of <b>business</b> <b>collaboration.</b> Firms prefer collaborating with larger partners. Bigger firms {{are more likely to}} achieve success collaborations. However, size difference plays a negative role in <b>business</b> <b>collaboration.</b> Collaborating with a bigger partner makes it harder to succeed.
