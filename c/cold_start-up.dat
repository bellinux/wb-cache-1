40|$|Combined {{heat and}} power (CHP) plants {{are widely used}} in {{industrial}} applications. In {{the aftermath of the}} recession, many of the associated production processes are under-utilized, which challenges the competitiveness of chemical companies. However, under-utilization can be a chance for tighter interaction with the power grid, which is in transition to the so-called smart grid, if the CHP plant can dynamically react to time-sensitive electricity prices. In this paper, we describe a generalized mode model on a component basis that addresses the operational optimization of industrial CHP plants. The mode formulation tracks the state of each plant component in a detailed manner and can account for different operating modes, e. g. fuel-switching for boilers and supplementary firing for gas turbines, and transitional behavior. Transitional behavior such as warm and <b>cold</b> <b>start-ups,</b> shutdowns and pre-computed start-up trajectories is modeled with modes as well. The feasible region of operation for each component is described based on input–output relationships that are thermodynamically sound, such as the Willans line for steam turbines.

Even though the duration of <b>cold</b> <b>start-up</b> is short compared with the hours of continuous steady operation in a waste incinerator, its negative effects with regard to PCDD/F emissions on both {{human health and the}} environment cannot be neglected.

40|$|Wind power varies over time, mainly {{under the}} {{influence}} of meteorological fluctuations. The variations occur on all time scales. Understanding these variations and their predictability is of key importance for the integration and optimal utilization of wind in the power system. There are two major attributes of variable generation that notably impact the participation on power exchanges: Variability (the output of variable generation changes and resulting in fluctuations in the plant output on all time scales) and Uncertainty (the magnitude and timing of variable generation output is less predictable, wind power output has low levels of predictability). Because of these variability and uncertainty wind plants cannot participate to electricity market, especially to power exchanges. For this purpose, the paper presents techno-economic analysis of work of wind plants together with combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant as support for offering continues power to electricity market. A model of wind farms and CCGT plant was developed in program PLEXOS based on real hourly input data and all characteristics of CCGT with especial analysis of techno-economic characteristics of different types of starts and stops of the plant. The Model analyzes the followings: costs of different start-stop characteristics (hot, warm, <b>cold</b> <b>start-ups</b> and shutdowns) and part load performance of CCGT. Besides the costs, the technical restrictions were considered such as start-up time depending on outage duration, minimum operation time, and minimum load or peaking capability.

The average temperature of a piston crown in a gasoline engine during normal operation is typically about , and the coolant {{that runs through}} the engine block is usually regulated at approximately [...] Aluminum expands more than iron at this temperature range, so for the piston to fit the cylinder properly when at a normal operating temperature, the piston must have a loose fit when cold. In the 1970s, increasing concern over exhaust pollution caused the U.S. government to form the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which began writing and enforcing rules that required automobile manufacturers to introduce changes that made their engines run cleaner. By the late 1980s, automobile exhaust pollution had been noticeably improved, but more stringent regulations forced car manufacturers to adopt the use of electronically controlled fuel injection and hypereutectic pistons. Regarding pistons, it was discovered that when an engine was <b>cold</b> during <b>start-up,</b> a small amount of fuel became trapped between the piston rings. As the engine warmed up, the piston expanded and expelled this small amount of fuel which added to the amount of unburnt hydrocarbons in the exhaust.|$|R

The tests were performed at the station in the climate chamber at lowered ambient temperatures: – 7,- 15 and – 20 oC. A heated three-function platinum-palladium catalytic reactor with a metal monolith was used in the tests. The test methodology included a measurement of toxic fume concentraction upstream and downstream the catalytic reactor at simultaneous measurement of the start-up parameters and measurement of temperatures in selected engine and catalytic reactor locations. A period of the <b>cold</b> engine <b>start-up</b> is characterized by a relatively high carbon oxide and hydrocarbon emission.

As a result of the tests the influence of heating up the reactor on its operation during the self-ignition engine start-up was identified. Carbon oxide and hydrocarbon emission during the start-up period can be reduced by initial heating up the catalytic reactor before the start-up by means of an electric heater.

40|$|In the strive towards {{decreasing}} {{carbon dioxide}} emissions from the growing transport sector, the interest for more fuel-efficient combustion engines operating under lean (oxygen excess) conditions has increased. The combustion products, however, formed in such engines contribute considerably to air pollution. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) are the major toxic components together with carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) {{that need to be}} regulated. Selective catalytic reduction with ammonia (NH 3 -SCR) is an efficient method to reduce NOx under lean conditions. Metal-exchanged zeolites are proven to be active catalysts for this process. One of the major requirements for the practical application of zeolites for NOx reduction, which is not yet sufficient, is their durability under hydrothermal conditions. Another problem of SCR systems for vehicles is the relatively low catalytic activity at low temperatures leading to that most of the emitted NOx origins from <b>cold</b> low-load <b>start-up,</b> and short travelling distances. Therefore, further development of the currently used NH 3 -SCR catalysts is of high practical as well as scientific interest. In the present work, different strategies to improve ion-exchanged zeolites as NH 3 -SCR catalysts are investigated. Special attention is paid to modifying the zeolite synthesis conditions, choice of metal for ion-exchange with and effect of method for zeolite functionalization. In particular, zeolites with MFI, CHA and *BEA framework structures have been ion-exchanged with iron and copper by aqueous ion-exchange (AIE), wet impregnation (WI), solid state ion-exchange in air (SSIE) and solid state ion-exchange facilitated by NH 3 and NO ([NH 3 +NO]-SSIE). The catalytic properties of the prepared samples were tested for various reactions relevant to NH 3 -SCR conditions, namely NH 3 -SCR, NH 3 oxidation, and NO oxidation. Moreover, the physicochemical properties of the samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, N 2 sorption, ICP-AES, XRF, UV-Vis, NH 3 -TPD, SSNMR and DRIFTS. The synthesis conditions as well as choice of the metal and method of functionalization were all shown to be important for the structural and catalytic properties of the functionalized zeolites. Among the methods for functionalization, [NH 3 +NO]-SSIE generally leads to the most active catalysts. Moreover, the zeolite functionalization with transition metal ions was shown to significantly enhance the NH 3 -SCR activity. Cu-exchanged zeolites show high NH 3 -SCR activity over a broad temperature range, especially at low temperatures, while Fe-exchanged zeolites are more active for NH 3 -SCR at high temperatures. Additionally, sequential ion-exchange with both iron and copper leads to catalysts with high activity over broad temperature range. Furthermore, it was found that Fe 2 + species rather than Fe 3 + species, and similar, Cu+ species rather than Cu 2 + species are beneficial for NOx reduction in NH 3 -SCR...|$|R
40|$|The {{selective}} {{catalytic reduction}} of NO by propylene {{in the presence of}} oxygen is a system of great potential technological significance due to the urgent need to develop efficient catalytic systems for the treatment of exhaust gases of lean burn or Diesel engines. The existing commercial catalysts succeed, in a satisfactory degree, the NO reduction in exhaust gases operated in the stoichiomentric air/fuel ratio. A technological target for such systems {{is to be able to}} operate at temperatures as low as 200 oC (in order to reduce emissions during <b>cold</b> engine <b>start-up)</b> and in high excess of oxygen. It has been well documented during recent decade that the catalytic activity and selectivity of porous metal films interfaced with solid electrolytes can be affected in a very pronounced and controlled manner upon polarization of the catalyst-electrode. This phenomenon is known in the literature as Electrochemical Promotion (E. P.) or Non-Faradaic Electrochemical Modification of Catalytic Activity (NEMCA effect) and it has been studied for more than 70 different catalytic systems. In the first part of this thesis, the electrochemical promotion of the NO reduction by propylene in presence of oxygen was investigated on porous polycrystalline Rh catalyst-electrodes deposited on YSZ (Y 2 O 3 – stabilized ZrO 2) an O 2 - conductor. The experiments were carried out in galvanic cells of the type: NO C 3 H 6, O 2 products Rh YSZ Au products NO C 3 H 6, O 2 The experimental conditions were close to those in the exhaust of a lean burn or diesel engine, i. e., high gas-hourly-space-velocity (GHSV), considerable open circuit catalytic performance and in some cases considerable excess of oxygen. It was found that both the oxygen and hydrocarbon partial pressures affect the catalytic rates and the extend of the phenomenon of electrochemical promotion. Rate enhancement ratios of 200 and faradaic efficiencies of 7000 were observed for the case of CO 2 production while those for N 2 production were 55 and 550, respectively. The reaction exhibits inverted volcano type behaviour, that means a rate enhancement observation under both anodic and cathodic polarization. In the second part, the oxidation of two volatile organic compounds (VOCs), Ethylene and Toluene, was investigated on polycrystalline RuO 2 films deposited on the same electrolyte of YSZ. The rates of ethylene and tolouene oxidation were enhanced by a factor of 20 and 8 respectively under anodic polarization. Cathodic polarization enhances the catalytic rates by a factor of 3 and 4 respectively. No partial pressure products were observed.

At much lower loads, the system efficiency drops because of the deterioration in the {{performance of}} the compressor, expander, and, eventually, the fuel cell. The results also indicate that the PEFC system can start rapidly from ambient temperatures. Depending on the specific weight of the fuel cell (1. 6 kg/kW in this case), the system takes up to 180 s to reach its design operating conditions. The PEFC system has been evaluated for three mid-size vehicles: the 1995 Chrysler Sedan, the near-term Ford AIV (Aluminum Intensive Vehicle) Sable, and the future P 2000 vehicle. The results show that the PEFC system can meet the demands of the Federal Urban Driving Schedule and the Highway driving cycles, for both warm and <b>cold</b> <b>start-up</b> conditions. The results also indicate that the P 2000 vehicle can meet the fuel economy goal of 80 miles per gallon of gasoline (equivalent) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} low {{temperatures}} down to - 40 °C {{on the performance}} and component properties of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack was investigated. By analyzing the temperature-dependent high-frequency resistance, the mechanism of ice formation within the stack was investigated during freeze/thaw (F/T) cycling while the stack was not operating and during a <b>cold</b> <b>start-up.</b> A step-like change in conductivity at 0 °C indicates that the membranes are dehydrated at sub-zero temperatures due {{to a change in}} capillary pressure at the interface membrane/catalyst. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} stack shows little degradation when it is dried out before cooling down. Freezing in a wet state and additional cold start-ups resulted in performance degradation which was mainly attributed to changes in wetting properties. Ex situ environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) investigations showed distinct damage and increasing porosity of the electrode in the wet frozen stack, which was most likely the reason for the change in wetting properties. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectroscopy showed distinct concentrations of platinum in the exhaust gas of the dry cycled stack, but no additional platinum was found when the stack was cycled in a wet state. Additional ex situ F/T investigations of gas diffusion layers (GDLs) and membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) within an ESEM confirmed the results, found by in situ investigations of the fuel cell stacks. Serious detachment of electrode material was found without the compressive force applied to an assembly...|$|E
40|$|A {{review was}} {{conducted}} of past laboratory-scale test methods {{and to assess}} their validity for ranking materials and lubricants for use as piston and liner materials in compression-ignition (CI) and spark-ignition (SI) engines. Most of the previous work was aimed at simulating SI engine environments. This report begins {{with a discussion of}} the numerous factors that can affect the validity of an approach to simulating engine conditions in a laboratory. These include not only mechanical, chemical and thermal factors, but also human factors as regards how the vehicle is operated and maintained. The next section provides an annotated review of open literature publications that address the issues of laboratory simulation of engine components. A comparison of these studies indicates a lack of sufficient standardization in procedures to enable a systematic comparison of one publication to another. There were just a few studies that compared several laboratory test methods to engine test results, and these indicated that some test methods correlate, at least qualitatively, better than others. The last section provides a series of recommendations for improving the accuracy and validity of laboratory-scale simulations of engine behavior. It became clear that much of the engine wear damage occurs during start-up when the engine is cold, and this calls into the question the usefulness of test methods that attempt to simulate steady-state running conditions. It is recommended that a new standard test method, perhaps developed {{with the help of the}} ASTM wear and erosion committee, be developed. It would use <b>cold</b> <b>start-up</b> conditions in the presence of degraded oil, or simulated degraded oil...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} in vehicle exhaust emissions {{achieved in the}} last two decades is offset by the growth in traffic, as well as by changes in the composition of emitted pollutants. The present investigation illustrates the emissions of eight in-use gasoline and diesel passenger cars using the official European driving cycle and the ARTEMIS real-world driving cycles. Measurements comprised gaseous regulated pollutants (CO, CO 2, NOx and hydrocarbons), particulate matter and its carbonaceous content (organic and elemental carbon, OC and EC), as well as about 20 different volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the C 6 –C 11 range. It was observed that some of the vehicles do not comply with the corresponding regulations. Significant differences in emissions were registered between driving cycles. Not all regulated pollutants showed a tendency to decrease from Euro 3 to Euro 5. The particulate carbon emission factors were significantly lower under the ARTEMIS Road compared with the ARTEMIS Urban driving cycle with cold start. In general, <b>cold</b> <b>start-up</b> driving conditions produced the highest emission factors. A tendency to the decline of carbonaceous emissions from Euro 3 to Euro 5 diesel vehicles was observed, whilst this trend was not registered for petrol-powered cars. The fraction of total carbon composed of EC was much lower in particles emitted by petrol vehicles (< 10 %) than by diesel engines (50 – 95 %). However, the EC content in emissions from more modern vehicles equipped with diesel particulate filter (DPF) is almost negligible. Among VOCs, benzene, toluene and xylenes were generally the dominant species. A significant decrease i...|$|E
40|$|According to the US Department of Transportation, {{more than}} 10 % of the nation’s bridges are {{structurally}} deficient. Wireless sensor {{technology is a}} superior solution for monitoring this deteriorating infrastructure as it {{eliminates the need for}} expensive wiring and permits easy relocation of sensors nodes. As these Structural Health Monitoring sensors (SHM) must operate continuously for many years without human intervention, battery replacement is a significant concern since the sensors are typically located in hard-to-reach and dangerous locations. The low frequency vibrations present on a bridge can be up-converted with an energy harvester. These up-converted outputs are ultra-low power (~ 10 uW), low voltage (100 to 450 mV), and non-periodic. This thesis develops circuit techniques capable of cold start, boosting, rectifying and storing the harvested energy of mechanical vibration harvesters that have outputs that are low power, low voltage and non-periodic. Techniques are developed to overcome the diode drops inherent in rectification of these harvester signals. New techniques for high efficiency low voltage functioning and active IC-based sub-threshold start-up are introduced. This thesis includes: 1) The development of innovative IC harvesting circuits for electromagnetic vibration harvesters capable of enabling active diode charge pumps to record high boosting (× 10 - × 16), high power harvesting efficiency (50 %), low power functioning (< 1 uW), and record low input voltage (< 150 mV) functioning in a boosting circuit; 2) The use of sub-threshold functioning to enable a boosting low voltage (< 250 mV) active diode <b>cold</b> <b>start-up</b> on an IC-based energy harvesting circuit utilizing the unique start-up properties of charge pumps; 3) The use and study of discrete passive circuit solutions for vibration harvesters with record low voltage and low power outputs (< 60 mV and < 5 uW); and 4) The testing of these circuits under bridge-like conditions or on a real suspension bridge.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the effects of various intake charge motion control approaches on the <b>cold</b> <b>start-up</b> process of a port fuel injected SI engine. Engine experiments were performed to assess the effectiveness of enhanced charge motion on mixture preparation, combustion, and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. Different charge motions were produced by three different shapes of charge motion control valves (CMCV), which block off 75 % of the engine's intake ports. Cold-fluid steady state experiments were carried out with the CMCV open and closed. Increased charge motion with the CMCV closed was found to shorten the combustion duration, which caused the 50 % mass fraction burned to occur up to 5 ⁰ CA earlier for the same spark timing. By the use of the CMCV, significant improvements in combustion stability (up to 1. 5 % reduction in COV) and fuel efficiency (up to 8 % reduction in ISFC) were achieved with increased levels of spark timing retard due to enhanced air-fuel mixing and relatively faster burning. Engine start-up experiments were conducted with three different geometric charge motion control valves. (cont.) The CMCV improved mixture preparation due to increased swirl and tumble intensities, which enhanced fuel distribution and evaporation. Moderate spark retard (AOp = - 5 ⁰) was found to reduce the engine-out HC emissions during the engine start-up process. Peak engine-out HC emissions with the CMCV closed occurred in the earlier stages of engine start-up process relative to the CMCV open case. Greater fuel vaporization and faster burning rate with the CMCV closed allowed reduced fuel injection and additional spark retard, resulting in significantly reduced HC emissions. The engine-out HC emissions were reduced by 18 % during the 0 - 3 seconds and by 7 % during the 3 - 20 seconds. by Dongkun Lee. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{cold start}} {{performance}} of automotive diesel engines is currently poor {{when compared to}} similar gasoline units. This thesis describes an experimental and theoretical investigation into the factors limiting diesel cold start behaviour. Studies {{have been carried out}} on IDI and DI designs of engine. Start behaviour has been characterised in terms of times taken to complete various stages of startup, engine speed variations and processes which affect these. Combustion and friction behaviour have been investigated in detail. Engine friction losses are dependent on temperature. During start-up these losses are relatively high compared to those when the engine is fully-warm. The work output from combustion is low at low speeds, and prone to a further deterioration at lower temperatures. Consequently, combustion output during cold cranking is initially insufficient to overcome frictional losses. The start times are extended by the need to keep the starter motor engaged until heat generated in the engine causes frictional losses to fall. Eventually, when combustion output is able to overcome friction without the aid of starter motor work, idle speed is reached. Changes to fuel injection and glowplug parameters have been used to achieve a limited improvement in low-temperature starting. Measurements of engine friction have been carried out to determine the influence of temperature and speed, and the relative contributions from each of the main component assemblies. At low temperatures, much of the friction originates in hydrodynamically lubricated components such as journal bearings, due to high oil viscosity at low temperature. Additionally, engine friction as rotation begins {{has been shown to be}} far higher than measured by conventional "steady-state" motoring tests (over twice the quasi-steady state friction at - 200 e). This initially high friction transient decays towards the quasi-steady values throughout the start. For crankshaft bearings, a friction model has been developed for <b>cold</b> <b>start-up</b> through to fully warm engine conditions. The friction behaviour in the bearings is dependent on thermal conditions around the friction surfaces. Models for the starter system and blowby processes are also presented as part of a broader theoretical investigation to assess the impact of design changes on start quality...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Particulate number (PN) standards in current and future emissions legislation pose a challenge for designers and calibrators during the warm-up phases of cold direct injection spark ignition (DISI) engines. To achieve catalyst light-off conditions in the shortest time, engine strategies are often employed that inherently use more fuel to attain higher exhaust temperatures. These {{can lead to the}} generation of locally fuel-rich regions within the combustion chamber and hence the formation and emission of particulates. To meet these emissions requirements, further understanding of the DISI in-cylinder processes during cold-start are required. This thesis investigates the effect of cooling an optical research engine to temperatures as low as - 7 °C, one of the legislative test conditions. A high-speed 9 kHz optical investigation of the in-cylinder combustion and fuel spray along with in-cylinder pressure measurements was completed with the engine motored and fired at 1500 rpm during combustion conditions that were essentially homogeneous and stoichiometric. Results showed significant differences between the flame growth structures at various operating temperature conditions with the notable presence of fuel-rich regions, which are understood to be prominent areas of particulate formation. Measured engine performance parameters such as indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and mass fraction burned (MFB) times correlated with the observed differences in combustion characteristics and flame growth speed. It was shown that flash boiling of the fuel spray was present in the fully heated engine case and significantly reduced the penetration of the spray plume and the likelihood of piston crown and cylinder liner impingement. The flow and combustion processes of a transient production <b>cold</b> <b>start-up</b> strategy were analysed using high-speed particle image velocimetry (HSPIV). Results highlighted a broad range of flame structures and contrasting flame stoichiometry occurring at different times in the start-up process. Turbulent flow structures were identified that {{have an effect on the}} fuel spray development and combustion process as well as providing a path for cold-start emissions reduction. PN and transient hydrocarbon (HC) emissions were measured at cold conditions to further elucidate the effect of operating temperature and correlate emissions data with in-cylinder measurements. A clear link between the quantity and size range of particulate and HC emissions and operating temperature was shown and the precise in-cylinder location of HC emissions, caused by fuel impingement, was inferred from the HC emissions data...|$|E
