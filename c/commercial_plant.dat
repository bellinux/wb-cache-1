25|$|The green pitcher {{plant has}} {{suffered}} a devastating decline throughout its former range.

Pitcher plants have also been over-collected for the <b>commercial</b> <b>plant</b> trade; such rare and unusual species are very popular with collectors. Today, around 34 naturally occurring populations persist but these are small and highly fragmented; most consist of fewer than 50 individuals.|$|E
25|$|Outside the {{tertiary}} institutions, {{the efforts}} of missionaries were in no way limited to religious instruction but also geared towards promoting social and economic advancement of the islands. They cultivated into the natives their innate taste for music and taught Spanish language to children. They also introduced advances in rice agriculture, brought from America maize and cocoa and developed the farming of indigo, coffee and sugar cane. The only <b>commercial</b> <b>plant</b> introduced by a government agency was the plant of tobacco.|$|E
25|$|Butadiene {{can also}} be {{produced}} by the catalytic dehydrogenation of normal butane (n-butane). The first such post-war <b>commercial</b> <b>plant,</b> producing 65,000 tons per year of butadiene, began operations in 1957 in Houston, Texas. Prior to that, in the 1940s the Rubber Reserve Company, {{a part of the}} United States government, constructed several plants in Borger, TX, Toledo, OH, and El Segundo, CA to produce synthetic rubber for the war effort as part of the United States Synthetic Rubber Program. Total capacity was 68 KMTA (Kilo Metric Tons per Annum).|$|E

25|$|The Suncor {{plant was}} a {{landmark}} in oil sands development. It pioneered technology for bitumen extraction and upgrading, {{and it was}} the world's first large-scale <b>commercial</b> <b>plant.</b> In the early years it was not particularly profitable, but the plant was nonetheless able to cover operating expenses from the sale of its own production. And in 1979, when federal policy permitted the company to charge world price for its oil, the plant finally became a money-making asset to Suncor. The plant found solutions to the problems of extracting a commercial grade of oil from the sands - problems that had been the concern of financiers, chemists, petroleum engineers, metallurgists, mining engineers, geologists, physicists and many other scientists and pseudo-scientists for many decades.|$|E
25|$|Separation of {{isotopes}} by laser excitation is an Australian {{development that}} also uses UF6. After a protracted development process involving U.S. enrichment company USEC acquiring and then relinquishing commercialization {{rights to the}} technology, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) signed a commercialization agreement with Silex Systems in 2006. GEH has since built a demonstration test loop and announced plans to build an initial commercial facility. Details of the process are classified and restricted by intergovernmental agreements between United States, Australia, and the commercial entities. SILEX has been projected to be {{an order of magnitude}} more efficient than existing production techniques but again, the exact figure is classified. In August, 2011 Global Laser Enrichment, a subsidiary of GEH, applied to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a permit to build a <b>commercial</b> <b>plant.</b> In September 2012, the NRC issued a license for GEH to build and operate a commercial SILEX enrichment plant, although the company had not yet decided whether the project would be profitable enough to begin construction, and despite concerns that the technology could contribute to nuclear proliferation.|$|E
500|$|In {{agriculture}} and animal husbandry, the Green Revolution's use of conventional hybridization increased yields by breeding [...] "high-yielding varieties". The replacement of locally indigenous breeds, compounded with unintentional cross-pollination and crossbreeding (genetic mixing), {{has reduced the}} gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds resulting {{in the loss of}} genetic diversity. Since the indigenous breeds are often well-adapted to local extremes in climate and have immunity to local pathogens, this can be a significant genetic erosion of the gene pool for future breeding. Therefore, <b>commercial</b> <b>plant</b> geneticists strive to breed [...] "widely adapted" [...] cultivars to counteract this tendency.|$|E
