25|$|For the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Cathy Freeman {{walked across}} a <b>circular</b> <b>pool</b> {{of water and}} ignited the {{cauldron}} through the water, surrounding herself within a ring of fire. The planned spectacular climax to the ceremony was delayed by the technical glitch of a computer switch which malfunctioned, causing the sequence to shut down by giving a false reading. This meant that the Olympic flame was suspended in mid-air for about four minutes, rather than immediately rising up a water-covered ramp {{to the top of}} the stadium. When it was discovered what the problem was, the program was overridden and the cauldron continued up the ramp, where it finally rested on a tall silver pedestal.|$|E

25|$|Legal {{requirements}} for tank size vary greatly {{from country to}} country. In the US, the minimum enclosure size is set by the Code of Federal Regulations, 9 CFR E § 3.104, under the Specifications for the Humane Handling, Care, Treatment, and Transportation of Marine Mammals. In 9 CFR 3.104, Table III classifies killer whales as Group I cetaceans with an average length of 24feet (7.315meters). Based on length, Table I states up to two killer whales may be held in a pool with a minimum horizontal dimension (the diameter of a <b>circular</b> <b>pool</b> of water) of twice that length or 48feet (14.63meters) and a minimum depth of 12feet (3.66m), giving a minimum volume of 615m3 for two killer whales. Each additional killer whale requires a pool with an additional 308m3 of volume. 9 CFR 3.104 also requires a minimum of 63m2 surface area per killer whale in Table IV (the example with a cylindrical tank 7.315m in diameter for two whales provides 84m2 of surface area per killer whale). Swiss regulations require a larger minimum volume: 400 m2 x 4.0m deep for two killer whales, or 1,600m3. The Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums (AMMPA) goes further, and recommends 1,918 m3 for two killer whales. The US exhibitors of captive killer whales belong to the AMMPA, but exhibitors in other countries do not.|$|E
25|$|The {{west coast}} of Little Sark is rocky, {{but there are two}} notable beaches to the north and east. The beach of Pot Bay {{stretches}} along the east coast from north of Brenière to Avocat Point, but this is a minor attraction compared to La Grande Grève, Sark's largest and most popular beach, which lies along the north coast of Little Sark and is normally accessible via steps cut in La Coupée (after a landslip temporarily closed the steps down to the shore a second way down has now (2016) been prepared and is usable). There are also popular swimming spots at the Venus Pool and Adonis Pool. The former (or Venus's Bath, as it is also known), named as such by Victorian artist William Toplis, lies close to the southeasternmost point of Little Sark. Protected and overhung by granite cliffs, it is largely free from prevailing winds and is a fine swimming spot. Completely covered by the sea at high tide, a low tide a <b>circular</b> <b>pool</b> originally some eighteen feet (five metres) deep (recent rockfalls have decreased its depth substantially) is separated from the sea. A smaller pool, Cupid's Bath, is also found nearby. The Adonis Pool is a similar tidal pool, though deeper, larger and less easily accessible than the Venus Pool; it is located close to the southwesternmost tip of Little Sark. The Adonis Pool enjoys longer periods of sunshine then the Venus Pool but is separated from the mainland at anything approaching half tide (the pool is covered by the sea at high tide) by a deep and fast flowing race of water where visitors require experience or careful instruction to cross to the Adonis rock safely.|$|E

40|$|The tidal flats of the Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania, {{are covered}} by vast beds of Zostera noltii. At low tide these {{seagrass}} beds appear to be interspersed with partly vegetated, <b>circular</b> <b>pools</b> of 5 - 25 in diameter. Between February and May 2001 we described these pools and studied their possible origin. Several hypotheses regarding the origin have been developed. The first group of hypotheses assumes that the pools result from erosion activity. Since human disturbance of seagrass beds at the Banc d'Arguin is virtually non-existent, causes should be found in natural bed disturbances and/or tide or wave action. Therefore, small gaps, simulating holes dug by the crab Callinectes marginatus, were made {{to see if they}} would further erode by tidal currents or waves. The experiments showed no erosion. Neither we found support for other hypotheses assuming erosion to be the cause of <b>circular</b> <b>pools.</b> The alternative group of hypotheses stated that sedimentation on the flats would be responsible. We conclude that accretion of creek remnants is the most likely process behind the development of the pools; this conclusion is based on both mapping of the pattern of pools, the sediment profile in and around the pools and the distribution of seagrass biomass. Also the disturbance experiments showed bed accretion rather than bed erosion and support this hypothesis. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
500|$|The {{pools in}} the fore and {{background}} contain bathers of both sexes. In the central <b>circular</b> <b>pool,</b> the sexes are mostly segregated, with several females adorned by peacocks and fruit. Four women carry cherry-like fruits on their heads, perhaps {{a symbol of}} pride at the time, as has been deduced from the contemporaneous saying: [...] "Don't eat cherries with great lords — they'll throw the pits in your face." [...] The women are surrounded by a parade of naked men riding horses, donkeys, unicorns, camels and other exotic or fantastic creatures. Several men show acrobatics while riding, apparently acts designed to gain the females' attention, which highlights the attraction felt between the two sexes as groups. The two outer springs also contain {{both men and women}} cavorting with abandon. Around them, birds infest the water while winged fish crawl on land. Humans inhabit giant shells. All are surrounded by oversized fruit pods and eggshells, and both humans and animals feast on strawberries and cherries.|$|E

6000|$|In {{a minute}} or two the bow of the boat arrived {{at the end of the}} screen of bushes, and a low exclamation broke from the {{lieutenant}} and Harry simultaneously; they were looking out on to an almost <b>circular</b> <b>pool</b> some two hundred yards in diameter. In the center were moored six prahus. Two of them lay broadside on to the creek, the other four were in a line behind these, and it seemed that their broadsides were directed to the opposite side of the pool, for the other two boats were in the way of their firing at the creek. They were long, low vessels, rowing some twenty oars on each side. Each carried a number of small brass guns, and they were evidently full of men, for numbers could be seen on deck, and boats were passing to and fro between them and a small village at the edge of the pool. Having taken in all the details of the scene, the lieutenant passed the word for the mate to leave his own boat and join him. When he did so, he whispered to him: [...] "I thought it was as well that you should have a view of these fellows' position too, Morrison, as it would be of use to you if you have to take a boat in to attack them." ...|$|E

40|$|Background: When {{exposed in}} {{previous}} experiments to a behavioural {{game in a}} three-pool laboratory theatre, common goldfish, Carassius auratus (the prey), and little egrets, Egretta garzetta (the predator), demonstrated optimal adjustments in their foraging and anti-foraging behaviours when confronted with different numbers of fish. Question: In a similar theatre with one, two or three pools and a fixed number of fish per pool, will predator and prey again solve the game and optimally adjust their foraging and anti-foraging behaviours? Methods: Experiments were conducted in two identical, circular aviaries (diameter 7 m) consisting of three <b>circular</b> <b>pools</b> (diameter 1. 52 m), each {{of which could be}} covered so as to remove it from an experiment.
