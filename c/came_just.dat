5|$|In January 2015, Starr tweeted {{the title}} of his new 11-track studio album, Postcards from Paradise. The album <b>came</b> <b>just</b> weeks in advance of Starr's {{induction}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and was released on 31 March 2015 to mixed to positive reviews. Later that month, Ringo and his band announced a forthcoming Summer 2016 Tour of the US. Full production began in June 2016 in Syracuse.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} women's teams on campus. The women's {{basketball}} {{team won the}} Atlantic 10 championship in 2014, advancing to {{the first round of}} the NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship. This feat <b>came</b> <b>just</b> 6 years after the team set an NCAA record for the worst season, finishing the season 0–29 in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Because the big {{gap between}} the ROK Capital and ROK 8th Divisions made it {{impossible}} for ROK I Corps at Kyongju to direct the action of the 8th Division, the ROK Army transferred that division to the control of the ROK II Corps on September 7, and attached to it the ROK 5th Regiment of the ROK 7th Division. This shift of command <b>came</b> <b>just</b> as the NK 15th Division penetrated the ROK 8th Division lines to enter Yongch'on in the Taegu-P'ohang-dong corridor. From west of An'gang-ni the ROK 3rd Regiment drove toward Yongch'on, attempting to close the gap.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{accession}} of Heraclius, the Sassanid advance pushed {{deep into}} the Levant, occupying Damascus and Jerusalem and removing the True Cross to Ctesiphon. The counter-attack launched by Heraclius took {{on the character of}} a holy war, and an acheiropoietos image of Christ was carried as a military standard (similarly, when Constantinople was saved from a combined Avar–Sassanid–Slavic siege in 626, the victory was attributed to the icons of the Virgin that were led in procession by Patriarch Sergius about the walls of the city). In this very siege of Constantinople of the year 626, amidst the climactic Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, the combined Avar, Sassanid, and Slavic forces unsuccessfully besieged the Byzantine capital between June and July. After this, the Sassanid army was forced to withdraw to Anatolia. The loss <b>came</b> <b>just</b> after news had reached them of yet another Byzantine victory, where Heraclius's brother Theodore scored well against the Persian general Shahin. Following this, Heraclius led an invasion into Sassanid Mesopotamia once again.|$|E
5|$|Klose's goal {{initiated}} {{a flurry of}} German scoring as Brazil {{lost control of the}} game. In the 24th minute, Kroos scored with a left-footed strike {{from the edge of the}} area after Lahm's cross was deflected. Then, in the 26th minute, just a few seconds after Brazil kicked off, Kroos caught Fernandinho in possession in his own half and played a one-two with Khedira before scoring again. Kroos' goals <b>came</b> <b>just</b> 70 seconds apart. Khedira himself scored in the 29th minute after exchanging passes with Mesut Özil. All five of Germany's first half goals came within the first half-hour, with four of them coming in one six-minute period. Brazil had no shots on target in the first half. Many Brazil supporters in the crowd were visibly in shock or reduced to tears. The resulting fights in the Mineirão stands forced the Military Police to send a special forces squad into the stadium.|$|E
5|$|These {{reinforcements}} <b>came</b> <b>just</b> in time {{to participate}} in a large German offensive against the Partisan forces in eastern Bosnia. Initially, the Regia Aeronautica also participated in this campaign, but after a tragic incident where an Italian bomber mistakenly attacked German positions near Vlasenica, the German command assigned the ZNDH the responsibility for providing the entire aerial support mission for formations on the ground. At this time there were no significant Luftwaffe forces based in Yugoslavian territory. In support of the ground forces, the ZNDH flew 121 combat missions in January, 100 missions in February and 350 in March. Although the Axis ground forces generally succeeded in their operations in January and February, in March they were forced to release the pressure as other Partisan units attacked several solitary NDH garrisons, threatening to destroy them.|$|E

5|$|With Chester, Whalley played {{mostly for}} the youth and reserve teams, {{but he made}} his Football League debut for the club in a 0–0 draw with Cambridge United on 18 September 2004, coming on as a {{substitute}} for Darryn Stamp. His debut <b>came</b> <b>just</b> one day after he signed a professional contract with Chester; manager Ian Rush had only included him on the substitutes' bench as a result of injuries to Daryl Clare and Michael Branch. The following week, {{he was part of the}} side that defeated Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough Stadium in the second round of the Football League Trophy. Whalley made three further senior appearances for Chester, all as a substitute, before leaving the club in the summer of 2005.|$|E
5|$|Mills {{took over}} as manager of Second Division Notts County on 9 January 2004 after the {{resignation}} of Bill Dearden, with the club lying 23rd in the Second Division table. His first match in charge <b>came</b> <b>just</b> a day later, in which Marc Goodfellow scored a stoppage time winner for Bristol City as County were beaten 2–1 at home. After a run of good form from late February to early March 2004 County rose out of the relegation zone, but a run of one victory from the last 12 matches of 2003–04 saw the club relegated to League Two in 23rd place. Despite having a healthier playing budget and a reorganisation of the squad {{during the summer of}} 2004, County made a disappointing start to 2004–05. As a result, Mills was dismissed on 4 November 2004 with the club 21st in League Two, and he declined the offer of a lesser position with the club. He resumed his playing career during early 2005 with Northern Counties East League Premier Division club Glapwell, playing under Lee Wilson, who Mills had previously played with and managed.|$|E
5|$|Vick {{has been}} a {{principal}} in two charitable foundations, the Michael Vick Foundation and The Vick Foundation. In June 2006, Vick, along with his brother Marcus and mother Brenda, established The Vick Foundation, a nonprofit organization to support at-risk youth with after-school programs in the Metro Atlanta and Hampton Roads areas. The announcement of the new organization <b>came</b> <b>just</b> {{before the start of}} the foundation's first fundraiser, the Michael Vick Golf Classic. The inaugural event was held at the prestigious Kingsmill Golf Course in James City County near Williamsburg, Virginia in partnership with The Virginia Tech Alumni Association Tidewater Chapter, and raised more than $80,000 for charity. According to its 2006 federal tax return, the Michael Vick Foundation provided 100 backpacks to poor children in Newport News and paid for an after-school program. The foundation spent 12% of its 2006 budget – $20,590 of $171,823 – on charitable programs and paid its fundraiser, Susan Bass Roberts, a former spokeswoman for Vick, $97,000. The foundation ceased operations that year. One of Vick's financial advisors withdrew $50,000 – most of the remaining funds – from its checking account in 2008.|$|E

5|$|With Blackburn {{now in the}} Championship, Slew {{was still}} unable to make the break into the first team and was instead loaned to League One side Oldham Athletic for six months in August 2012. Slew scored on his Oldham debut, netting in a 2–4 League Cup loss to Sheffield Wednesday a week after signing. After only four {{appearances}} for his temporary club, Slew suffered a stress fracture to his back and was sidelined for over three months, returning to Blackburn Rovers for treatment, and effectively ending his loan spell. Having recovered from his injury, Slew signed a six-week loan deal with League Two side Rotherham United {{at the end of}} January 2013. Slew's first appearance for Rotherham <b>came</b> <b>just</b> two days later, in a 3–1 win against promotion rivals Northampton Town, and he played regularly for the duration of his loan spell, making seven appearances in total. Despite Rotherham hoping to retain Slew's services {{until the end of the}} season, they were unable to agree a deal with Blackburn Rovers, and Slew returned to Ewood Park once more.|$|E
