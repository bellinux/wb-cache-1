In July 1925, a new arrangement was introduced whereby aircraft not fitted with radio, flying across the Channel, could have their departure and arrival reported by radio to the authorities. A circuit of Lympne and St Inglevert {{had to be}} flown at a height not exceeding [...] on departure for, and arrival from, the continent. Between 1–3 August, the Royal Aeronautical Society held a meeting at Lympne. The Grosvenor Challenge Cup, Private Owners' <b>Cup,</b> <b>Light</b> Aeroplane Holiday Handicap and International Handicap were all competed for. Separate Speed Races were held for single and two-seater aircraft. In August 1925, the scheme for non-radio aircraft was extended to cover Ostend. One hour was allowed for the crossing to St Inglevert and two hours for the crossing to Ostend, after which the aircraft would be reported as missing. On 25 September, Lympne {{was one of a}} number of airfields which began operating a radio direction finding service. As before the 900-metre wavelength was used.|$|E

40|$|The {{acoustical}} attenuation of {{five different}} hearing protectors were investigated using real impulses and miniature microphone technique in field conditions from a 23 mm antiaircraft cannon, from 122 mm howitzer and from {{an explosion of}} 1 kg of TNT. The measurements were carried out using voluntary military officers exposed to similar impulses in their work. The combination of earmuffs and earplugs proved to give the best attenuation.

40|$|At the {{department}} of neuroscience at Uppsala University one of the research groups are working with motion vision. Motion vision is how seeing animal species process moving objects in their visual fields and how they experience self motion by generating an optic flow. This is important for animals of all sizes, everything from large mammals to insects. At the neuroscience department at Uppsala University they are using flies in their research as these are easier to work with than larger animals. Behavioral output {{as a result of}} visual stimuli is what is studied in the project I have been involved in as a part of this thesis. This is done by a track ball setup. The setup consists of a cup with a light plastic ball in it, {{from the bottom of the}} <b>cup</b> <b>light</b> airflow is added to reduce friction between the ball and the cup. A fly is tethered on top of the ball in such a way that when the fly is trying to walk the ball instead rotates accordingly. The ball rotation can then be measured by two sensors, both of which have been extracted from an optical mouse. There is no available, ready-made, software for reading the raw mouse data from the two sensors and from that input reconstructs the virtual movement path of the fly using. Therefore the purpose of this thesis has been to design and implement a user friendly and functional software system that fulfill this requirement. The design was done according to the principles of user-centered system design although with less formal documentation. This proved to generate a very good result. The end-users were included in every phase of the development process and it really was a huge advantage for the development process. Although all of the methods made available by the theories were not followed religiously, especially regarding documentation, that just displayed the power of agile methods were quality is more important than documentation. And the evaluation at the end of the project showed that the level of usability was high...|$|E
