5|$|Day-to-day {{killer whale}} {{behaviour}} generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales engage in frequent behaviour {{at the surface}} such as breaching (jumping <b>completely</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water) and tail-slapping. These activities may {{have a variety of}} purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping, a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water, helps the animal view its surroundings.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} April 1920, the Yankees were 4–7, {{with the}} Red Sox leading the league with a 10–2 mark. Ruth had done little, having injured himself {{swinging}} the bat. Both situations began to change on May 1, when Ruth hit a tape measure home that sent the ball <b>completely</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polo Grounds, a feat {{believed to have been}} previously accomplished only by Shoeless Joe Jackson. The Yankees won, 6–0, taking three out of four from the Red Sox. Ruth hit his second home run on May 2, {{and by the end of}} the month had set a major league record for home runs in a month with 11, and promptly broke it with 13 in June. Fans responded with record attendance figures. On May 16, Ruth and the Yankees drew 38,600 to the Polo Grounds, a record for the ballpark, and 15,000 fans were turned away. Large crowds jammed stadiums to see Ruth play when the Yankees were on the road.|$|E
5|$|Common {{threshers}} are active, strong swimmers; {{there are}} infrequent reports of them leaping <b>completely</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water. Like the fast-swimming sharks {{of the family}} Lamnidae, the common thresher has a strip of aerobic red muscle along its flank that is able to contract powerfully and efficiently {{for long periods of}} time. In addition, they have slow-oxidative muscles centrally located within their bodies and a blood vessel countercurrent exchange system called the rete mirabile ("wonderful net"), allowing them to generate and retain body heat. The temperature inside the red muscles of a common thresher averages 2°C (3.6°F) above that of the ambient seawater, though there is significant individual variation. Unlike the pelagic and bigeye threshers, the common thresher lacks an orbital rete mirabile to protect its eyes and brain from temperature changes.|$|E

25|$|Two weeks later, the Curtin government, {{along with}} various State governments, passed laws that entirely banned sport on weekdays, which {{naturally}} put three- or four-day cricket <b>completely</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question. Consequently, no first-class cricket was played in Australia in 1942–43, 1943–44 or 1944–45. The MCG was also commandeered by the services until the 1946–47 season, so that senior games in Victoria (and several first-class games in 1945–46) {{were held at}} Princes Park, Carlton. With the lifting of weekday sport bans after the Pacific War ended in 1945, first-class cricket in Australia resumed on 23 November at the Gabba between Queensland and New South Wales, though the Sheffield Shield was not awarded until 1946–47.|$|E
25|$|Lever drags {{work through}} cam action to {{increase}} or decrease pressure on the drag washers located on the spool itself. Most lever drags offer preset drag positions for strike (reduced drag to avoid tearing the hook out of the fish), full (used once the hook is set) and freespool (see above). Lever drags are simpler and faster to adjust during the fight. And, since they use the spool for the washer stack rather than the drive gear, the washers can be larger, offering more resistance and smoother action. The disadvantage is that in freespool, there can be residual and unwanted resistance since the drag mechanism may not be <b>completely</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> picture without resorting to more complex mechanics.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of their loss against Tennessee, Alabama dropped <b>completely</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AP Poll prior to their game against Clemson. In their only non-conference road game of the season, the Crimson Tide {{narrowly}} defeated the Tigers of the Atlantic Coast Conference 13–10 at Memorial Stadium. Alabama took a 7–0 lead in the first quarter on a one-yard run Ed Morgan, and Clemson responded with a 30-yard Steedley Candler field goal that made the score 7–3 {{at the end of the}} first. Alabama then scored their final points of the game on a pair of Steve Davis field goals in the second that made the halftime score 13–3. After a scoreless third, Clemson made the final score 13–10 with a one-yard Buddy Gore touchdown run in the fourth quarter. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against Clemson to 8–3.|$|E

25|$|The New York Times, however, {{reported}} that {{it was unlikely that}} NBC would get baseball, as the network would have to preempt up to three weeks of NFL coverage on Sunday nights. However, the NFL used to not schedule a Sunday night game on the second night of the World Series, which meant that NBC gaining the rights was not <b>completely</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question (however, the following Sunday, in which a possible World Series Game 7 is scheduled, a Sunday night NFL game is also scheduled). In addition to this, other Sunday playoff games, such as the ALCS and NLCS could be pushed to the afternoon. This might not be appetizing to league officials, as major playoff games would go up head-to-head against highly rated afternoon NFL games (as opposed to today's system, in which only one game out of two for the day would go up against network NFL broadcasts).|$|E

500|$|In Overwatch, Tracer is {{classified}} as an [...] "offense" [...] character. She is also listed as a two-star (medium) difficulty character for players. Reflecting her offensive role, she comes equipped with dual [...] "Pulse Pistols," [...] which reload quickly and deal damage rapidly at a short range. Her speed is especially noted by video game media, as she is the fastest character on the game's roster. This attribute is noted {{to be one of}} the advantages that comes with playing as her, but also an annoyance to opposing players. Her speed is supplemented through her [...] "Blink" [...] and [...] "Recall" [...] abilities—Blink, which comes with three charges, allows her to teleport a short distance in the same direction she is traveling. Using this ability may allow Tracer to [...] "zip behind an enemy in an instant for surprise attacks, or dodge <b>completely</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line of fire". This ability has a cooldown period, meaning the player has to wait for each Blink to recharge, although the cooldown period is relatively short. In addition, her Recall ability allows her to rewind to her position three seconds prior, as well as resetting her health and ammo. Like Blink, her Recall ability also has a cooldown period. Although Tracer has a speed advantage, she also has one of the lowest health pools in the game. Finally, her ultimate ability is her [...] "Pulse Bomb": a sticky that clings to the first surface or hero it hits, then detonates shortly after, dealing area of effect damage.|$|E
