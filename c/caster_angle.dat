The steering axis is the axis about which the steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. The steering axis angle usually matches {{the angle of}} the head tube.|$|E
25|$|Steering angles {{are also}} crucial {{as the driver}} progresses. The first stage of these {{modifications}} is usually a modified steering knuckle or upright. Extended control arms can be employed on MacPherson strut vehicles like the Nissan S-Chassis, as to allow for more clearance for higher steering angles. Companies like Wisefab, IRP (Individual Racing Parts), Voodoo13, and Parts Shop MAX have developed full lock kits including modification of the vehicle's original scrub radius, kingpin axis, Ackermann angle, amount of bump steer, <b>caster</b> <b>angle,</b> and kinematics as to maximize front grip and eliminate mechanical bind at steering angles in excess of 60°. While MacPherson strut vehicles are prevalent in profession drifting, Double wishbone suspension vehicles can also be competitive, with often better caster and camber curves.|$|E

40|$|A {{variation}} in the camber of an automotive wheel is desired to compensate a side-slip force change owing to normal load transfer when the car is cornering. The camber of a steered wheel can be varied by adjusting <b>caster</b> or lean <b>angle</b> which are the representations of steering axis orientation. Thus, a smart camber can be created by a variable <b>caster</b> or lean <b>angle.</b> Choosing which parameter among the two angles to be variable is very important and dependent on its different effects. Here, homogeneous transformation is employed to establish camber {{as a function of}} <b>caster,</b> lean <b>angle,</b> and steering angle in the general case. A comparison between <b>caster</b> and lean <b>angle</b> based on different criteria is then made. The comparison shows that a variable caster is much better and more feasible than a variable lean angle in generating a smart camber...|$|R
40|$|YesThis paper {{presents}} a simulation study into {{the characteristics of}} a vehicle experiencing steering drift under straight line braking. Simulation modelling has been performed using a multi-body dynamics analysis based on a model of an actual vehicle. Front and rear suspension parameters have been modelled as rigid links joined with flexible bushes so as to assess their effect on a vehicle while braking. Suspension geometry and alignment settings, which define characteristic responses such as lateral acceleration, yaw velocity, toe, and <b>caster</b> <b>angles</b> of a vehicle in a transient manoeuvre, are primary to a vehicle¿s directional stability. Any symmetric inconsistencies in these settings will potentially affect a vehicle¿s performance. The findings from this research have increased the understanding of the causes of steering drift during braking conditions...|$|R

50|$|As {{the truck}} {{features}} a straight-axle arrangement, the TXT-1 is particularly adept at RC-scale rock crawling. In short, the straight-axle system allows the entire axle and chassis to better articulate itself over obstructions while efficiently conforming tire contact patches to the ground. As an aside, the wide gear contact patches and durable axle construction make the TXT-1 a very durable platform for either high-torque crawling applications or overall high-power brushed or brushless applications. The truck performs {{very well with}} no modifications required {{on a variety of}} surfaces, however some choose to lock differentials, change tire and wheel packages, reduce motor shaft-mounted pinion gear tooth count, mount the shock absorbers directly to the chassis and axle (thereby deleting the cantilever assembly), and reducing parts count and relocating electronic components to reduce weight and make the vehicle's weight distribution more advantageous for rock crawling. Advanced setups include cutting the lower portion of the chassis, changing the motor arrangement significantly (single motor setup with an external gear reduction unit), or changing the length of suspension links to modify <b>caster</b> <b>angles</b> and distances between axles and the chassis.|$|R

50|$|The <b>caster</b> <b>angle</b> or {{castor angle}} is the angular {{displacement}} of the steering axis from the vertical axis of a steered wheel in a car, motorcycle, bicycle or other vehicle, measured in the longitudinal direction. It is the angle between the pivot line (in a car an imaginary line {{that runs through the}} centre of the upper ball joint to the centre of the lower ball joint) and vertical. Car racers sometimes adjust <b>caster</b> <b>angle</b> to optimise their car's handling characteristics in particular driving situations.|$|E
50|$|The {{pivot points}} of the {{steering}} are angled such that a line drawn through them intersects the road surface slightly ahead of the contact patch of the tyre on the pavement. The purpose {{of this is to}} provide a degree of self-centring for the steering — the wheel casters around in order to trail behind the axis of steering. This makes a car easier to drive and improves its directional stability (reducing its tendency to wander). Excessive <b>caster</b> <b>angle</b> will make the steering heavier and less responsive, although in racing large caster angles are used for improving camber gain in cornering. Caster angles over 7 degrees with radial tyres are common. Power steering is usually necessary to overcome the jacking effect from the high <b>caster</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{steering}} axis angle, also called <b>caster</b> <b>angle,</b> is the angle {{that the head}} tube and hence the {{steering axis}} makes with the horizontal or vertical, depending on convention.

In {{order to}} improve overall vehicle {{performance}} and decrease movement deviation caused by uncertainties from automobile chassis, a robust vehicle chassis model is built with steering system, suspension system and braking system. In the model, {{the length of the}} steering trapezoid arm, the bottom angle of trapezoid mechanism, inclination <b>angle,</b> <b>caster,</b> camber and toe-in are defined as controllable variables, and load, driving force, steering torque are defined as noise factors. The optimum objectives include the maximum turning angle error of steering mechanism, the maximum braking sideslip and the maximum swing angle of front wheel on bumpy road. Taguchi method is applied to solve the robust result for automobile chassis model. Compared that the variances of objective values are decreased with the same noise factors and the robustness of sub-systems of chassis is improved...|$|R

The model also considers the particular geometry of the steering system, and also allows to change the characteristic parameters (i. e. <b>caster</b> and king-pin <b>angles,</b> length of the lever arms and tie rods, etc) in order to appreciate the changes in vehicle performance.

40|$|To monitor {{processes}} {{with multiple}} parallel gauges, {{we consider the}} issue of separating changes in the gauge bias from changes in the upstream process. We propose two new chart statistics based on the F test and a likelihood ratio test. We compare these proposals to available methods such as those discussed by Mortell and Runger (1995). The paper is motivated by a truck assembly process in which wheel alignment characteristics are measured on every truck produced by one of four alignment machines, arranged in parallel within the overall process. Key Words: control charts, multiple stream process, measurement system monitoring In industry, {{it is common to}} measure critical characteristics of the products from one process using multiple parallel gauges. For instance, in the assembly of light trucks, front wheel alignment is a key characteristic that affects the handling of a vehicle and the life of its tires. The characteristics measured include, among others, <b>caster</b> and camber <b>angles</b> on both the left and right side of the vehicle. In the assembly process, there is one production line. However, due to the high volume of trucks, there are four gauges to measure alignment characteristics. Each truck is measured by one gauge (100 % inspection) and adjustments are made as necessary. A process map is given in Figure 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{steering}} axis angle, also called <b>caster</b> <b>angle</b> or head angle, is the angle that the {{steering axis}} makes with the horizontal or vertical, depending on convention. The steering axis is the axis about which the steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. The steering axis angle usually matches {{the angle of}} the head tube.|$|E
40|$|The {{lateral force}} {{created by a}} tire {{necessary}} for a vehicle to change direction is generated by slip and camber angles. Camber angle may {{be defined as the}} angle between a vertical line passing through a wheels&# 039; center and the horizontal projection of this line onto the wheel. If the axis which the tire turns about is not parallel to the vertical axis, a change in camber will be induced {{as a result of the}} change in steer angle. This axis is called the steering axis and can be determined by the <b>caster</b> and lean <b>angles</b> relative to the wheel position in a body coordinate frame. The relation between the steer and camber angles may favor or detract from the lateral force being generated by the tire. This paper describes a method for determining the induced camber angle with respect to steer angle. In this method the wheel is defined throughout the steering range as a circle. The lowest point of the circle with respect to the global coordinate frame may then be defined via a method for determining maxima and minima. This point is then used to determine camber angle with respect to steer angle throughout the steering range. The lowest point of the tire may also be used in finding ride height and body roll due to change in steer angle. A sensitivity analysis reflects the suspension behavior for a variety of different suspension parameters. The relative difference between the induced steer angle about the steering axis and the actual steer angle with respect to the body coordinate frame are relevant in developing more accurate vehicle dynamics models...|$|R
5000|$|Second, {{the lean}} {{of the bike}} {{decreases}} the actual radius of the turn proportionally to the cosine of the lean angle. The resulting radius can be roughly approximated (within 2% of exact value) by:where [...] is the approximate radius, [...] is the wheelbase, [...] is the lean angle, [...] is the steering angle, and [...] is the <b>caster</b> <b>angle</b> of the steering axis.|$|E
50|$|The basic aim of {{steering}} is {{to ensure}} that the wheels are pointing in the desired directions. This is typically achieved by a series of linkages, rods, pivots and gears. One of the fundamental concepts is that of <b>caster</b> <b>angle</b> - each wheel is steered with a pivot point ahead of the wheel; this makes the steering tend to be self-centering towards the direction of travel.|$|E
50|$|The {{support arm}} carried all the load; the torque arm carried the {{accelerating}} and decelerating torque; the upper A-arm controlled the camber. Advantages claimed {{for the system}} included superior maintenance of wheel alignment from the wide spread of the lower A-arm, a permanent fixing of the <b>caster</b> <b>angle,</b> and an increased percentage of the braking force transmitted to the frame through the torque arm.|$|E

5000|$|Front-wheel {{alignment}} {{was made}} easier with and with greater accuracy {{by moving the}} camber adjustment from the upper to the lower control arm on the double wishbone suspension, and the <b>caster</b> <b>angle</b> adjustments also moved from the upper control arm to the drag strut.

50|$|In automobiles, {{a double}} {{wishbone}} suspension {{is an independent}} suspension design using two (occasionally parallel) wishbone-shaped arms to locate the wheel.

It used aluminium control arms and the front strut tubes were changed to a design similar (bolt on kingpins and swaybar mounted to strut tube) to the E28 5-series. This included carrying over the 5 series front wheel bearings and brake caliper bolt spacing. The rear suspension was a carry over from the E30.|$|E
