IfEis elementary abelian ofp-rankrandkis an algebraically closed field of characteristicp, then each point inkr−{ 0 } determines a <b>cyclic</b> <b>shifted</b> subgroup. Because the restriction of akE-module to this shifted subgroup depends only upon the corresponding point in projective space, it is often convenient to work with 2 kr− 1 instead ofkr−{ 0 }. Roughly speaking, this paper shows that ifVis an irreducible subvariety of 3 kr− 1 andMis akE-module, then for almost all points inVthe direct sum decomposition ofMis the same upon restriction; moreover, this decomposition is completely determined by the behavior ofMupon restriction to the <b>cyclic</b> <b>shifted</b> subgroup corresponding to the generic point ofV.
