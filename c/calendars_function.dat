50|$|Among {{the various}} {{calendar}} systems in use, two were particularly central and widespread across Mesoamerica.

50|$|Consideration {{should be}} given to ensure that IA devices and {{different}} software packages communicate with each other so that information is not lost or re-entry is not required by the user. Users do not always know or care what software is being used or which database is being accessed and do not understand why they must enter the same information again. For example, once the date has been entered, the user will be frustrated to be prompted to enter it again during the same session. Taking this further, the user may be frustrated to have to enter a date since there is a <b>calendar</b> <b>function</b> on the IA being used.|$|R

A passenger airbag cutoff that prevents the airbag from deploying if the seat is unoccupied (or occupied by a small person) was also added.

Recognizing that use patterns may be important considerations for development of handheld-based information systems, the authors characterized PDA use at their institution.

PDA use prevalence, user demographics, hardware preferences, and work setting and application use frequencies were assessed for respondents reporting current PDA use. Use patterns of trainees (residents and subspecialty fellows) and attending physicians were compared. Trainees reported more frequent PDA use in the hospital setting and for direct patient care.

There are few papers regarding melatonin and its role in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Melatonin may play a role in the pathogenesis of scoliosis (neuroendocrine hypothesis) but at present, the data available cannot clearly support this hypothesis. Uncertainties and doubts still surround the role of melatonin in human physiology and pathophysiology and future research is needed. </p...|$|R
