500|$|A remixed and remastered version, {{featuring}} four bonus tracks, {{was released}} in 2004 through Capitol Records {{as part of the}} group's reissued back catalogue. According to the liner notes of the remastered version of Cryptic Writings, Dave Mustaine had to alter many lyrics at the request of their new manager, Bud Prager. The liner notes suggest that Mustaine was not a fan of the changes, but other interviews indicate the band actively sought and eventually accepted Prager's advice for the album. [...] "I figured maybe this guy (Prager) <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> get that intangible number one record I wanted so badly", Mustaine wrote in the liner notes.|$|E
500|$|After the {{extensive}} world tour {{in support of}} Youthanasia, Megadeth took time off late in 1995. Mustaine began work on MD.45, a side project with vocalist Lee Ving of Fear. The duo hired drummer Jimmy DeGrasso, who had played with Alice Cooper on the South American Monsters of Rock tour earlier that year. Marty Friedman built a studio in his new home in Phoenix and completed his fourth solo album, released in April 1996. In September 1996, Megadeth went to London to work on songs for the next album. The songwriting was closely supervised by new manager Bud Prager, who contributed musical ideas and lyrics; many lyrics and song titles were changed at his request. Regarding Prager's influence, Mustaine later wrote: [...] "I figured maybe this guy [...] <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> get that intangible number one record I so badly wanted." [...] The album, recorded in Nashville, was Megadeth's first collaboration with country pop producer Dann Huff, who had met Mustaine in 1990.|$|E

He is a consumer advocate who does {{the right thing for}} the right reasons, and he knows insurance inside and out. I believe he is the most qualified commissioner of insurance ever to assume the position.|$|E

2500|$|CNN also {{profiled}} Emily. University of Pennsylvania Physiology professor Kevin Foskett {{said in the}} article, [...] "Emily and {{her family}} want research focused on her mutation to be as focused and accelerated as possible. At one level, that sounds a little selfish, until you realize that her type of mutation, a 'nonsense' mutation ... is responsible for disease in many other genetically inherited forms of disease... Emily's story is compelling. [...] If you've met Emily... you cant help but become engaged and energized." [...] Emily said in that piece, [...] "Obviously our prayer and dream {{is to have a}} breakthrough. [...] But we also realize that it might not happen, or it might not happen in time for me. And I think that in the worst case scenario, even if it never <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> there is a peace I get from at least knowing I'm doing everything I can, and it's not for lack of trying." ...|$|E
2500|$|Boam {{was born}} in Rochester, New York. He grew up in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, and {{his family moved to}} Sacramento, California when he was 11. His father was an {{aeronautical}} engineer. He developed a taste for action films by watching World War II film on television as a child. As a teenager, he saw the film Tom Jones, which he said [...] "made the greatest impression" [...] on him, ultimately making him [...] "want to be in movies." [...] He attended Sacramento State College, earning a B.A. in art in 1969. While interested in the film industry, he initially thought that his art training would lead him to a career in art direction or production design. Not wanting to [...] "serve in the ranks", he decided that directing would be most satisfying. He entered graduate school at UCLA film school, hoping to start a career in directing. He couldn't afford to pay for his own film, processing, and equipment. But he did own a typewriter, so he took a writing course and prepared to study screenwriting instead of directing. At UCLA, he took classes under Richard Walter. Boam took an advanced screenwriting class taught by William Froug. He decided to [...] "target" [...] Froug, hoping to impress the writing teacher into accepting him to be a directed studies student. Boam was impressed by Froug's success, and wanted one-on-one help. He said, [...] "I just knew that Bill <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> but I needed more than the slightly impersonal, two-hour-a-week instruction of the class." [...] He gave Froug two screenplays for review, but the writing teacher wasn't impressed with either of them. This didn't deter Boam, who persisted. Boam told Froug, [...] "Well, I'll just have to write better." [...] Froug relented and started mentoring him, and said that over the semesters Boam got [...] "better and better, but... was still struggling." [...] The two collaborated on a screenplay called Johnny, about the bank robber John Dillinger. On the day the screenplay was finished, they learned that director John Milius was starting production on Dillinger, destroying their hopes of selling their script as a feature. However, their script was bought under a one-year option for $10,000 by producer Edward Lewis, who sold it to NBC as a possible television movie. In the end, the screenplay was never produced.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{certainly}} my wish; but he stated doubtfully that he feared he <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> <b>me</b> much in this.
