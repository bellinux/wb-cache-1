Stover had a very low moisture content (6. 83 ± 0. 17 %), a gross calorific value (GCV) of 18. 57 MJ/kg of dry matter (± 0. 32 MJ/kg DM) and an ash content of 5. 88 % (± 1. 15 %). Small stover bales (8. 83 ± 0. 90 kg) were placed manually in the upper combustion chamber {{at a rate of}} 10. 5 to 12. 8 kg/h over a 24 -h period, with three replications, and compared to a control wood combustion trial (12. 1 kg/h during 24 h). The overall heat transfer efficiency for stover was lower than for wood (57 % vs. 77 %). Stover bales produced on average 7. 5 % ash which included about 2 % of unburned residues while wood produced 1. 7 % ash. CO gas emissions averaged 1324 mg/m³ for stover (118 mg/m³ for wood). The corn stover showed a good <b>calorific</b> <b>potential,</b> but {{it would have to be}} densified and the boiler should be modified to improve airflow, completeness of combustion and handling of the large amount of ash formed...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2015 American Scientific Publishers. Microalgae are {{considered}} a promising feedstock of biomass {{for the production of}} biofuels. The capacity of some strains to accumulate lipids makes them an interesting alternative for biodiesel production. The anaerobic digestion of the spent (lipid-extracted) biomass has been proposed as a way to increase energy yield and sustainability of bioenergy production from microalgae. Anaerobic digestion would produce biogas, but also would provide conditions for nutrients recovery. Present research was oriented to determine potential contribution of anaerobic digestion of spent biomass to biodiesel production from microalgae. Two microalgae species were considered in this study, Botryococcus braunii and Nannochloropsis gaditana. Bio-methane potential tests revealed methane yields of 407 and 450 mL CH 4 /gVS for B. braunii and N. gaditana, respectively. Latter values represent 56 and 61 % of total energy in spent microalgae, measured as <b>calorific</b> <b>potential.</b> Mass and energy balances for biodiesel and biogas production indicate that close to 14 % of the energy contained in the biomass could be transferred to biodiesel. When biogas is also produced, potential energetic yield of both biofuels would increases to close to 55 %. Energy balances of a potential biodiesel and biogas production indicate that traditional harvesting methods such as centrifugation and the inclusion of a biomass drying step process would yield negative energetic balances, even when biogas and biodiesel are both produced. Thus, future research efforts should focus on the development of low energy harvesting methods and in alternatives for biomass processing circumventing biomass drying. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: The {{palm oil}} {{industry}} generates {{an abundance of}} oil palm biomass such as the Empty Fruit Bunch (EFB), shell, frond, trunk and Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME). For 88 million tones of Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) processed in 2008, the amount of oil palm biomass was more than 26 million tones. Studies about production of bio-char from oil palm biomass are still lacking in Malaysia. So, this study was aimed to: (i) {{determine the effect of}} pyrolysis temperatures on bio-char yield (ii) characterize the bio-char obtained under different pyrolysed temperatures. Approach: In this study, pyrolysis of EFB was conducted using a fluidized fixed bed reactor. The effect of pyrolysis temperatures on bio-char yield was investigated. The pyrolysis temperature used ranged from 300 - 700 °C. The elemental analysis, calorific value, surface area and total pore volume of the bio-char were determined. Results: The highest bio char yield of 41. 56 % was obtained at an optimum pyrolysis temperature of 300 °C with particle size of 91 - 106 Î¼m and the heating rate of 30 °C min - 1. The calorific values of bio-char ranged from 23 - 26 MJ kg - 1.

Os principais produtos da biodigestÃo sÃo biogÃs e biofertilizante. O biogÃs Ã constituÃdo, principalmente, de metano (CH 4), diÃxido de carbono (CO 2), gÃs sulfÃdrico (H 2 S) e amÃnia (NH 3), o qual, na maioria dos casos Ã utilizado como combustÃvel para acionamento de motores estacionÃrios. Nesses casos, a presenÃa de CO 2, H 2 S e NH 3, comprometem a viabilidade do seu uso como combustÃvel, pois reduz o potencial calorÃfico e a vida Ãtil dos motores. Neste contexto, o trabalho teve como objetivo desenvolver e avaliar uma tecnologia alternativa para purificaÃÃo do metano contido no biogÃs proveniente da digestÃo anaerÃbica de dejetos de suÃnos. Para tanto, a metodologia contemplou a prospecÃÃo tecnolÃgica inerente ao assunto (remoÃÃo/purificaÃÃo de biogÃs), a identificaÃÃo de vantagens/desvantagens, o projeto/construÃÃo da tecnologia alternativa (protÃtipo) e a sua instalaÃÃo numa propriedade rural para efeitos de testes operacionais. Os resultados, demonstram a viabilidade tÃcnica e econÃmica para implementaÃÃo na situaÃÃo real. Especificamente foi alcanÃada uma reduÃÃo para os componentes corrosivos (96 % para o H 2 S e 83, 1 % para a NH 3), alÃm de 6 % de reduÃÃo do CO 2. A consequÃncia disso foi o aumento da concentraÃÃo do metano que atingiu 75 % viabilizando a utilizaÃÃo do biogÃs como combustÃvel. In recent years, {{the use of}} {{anaerobic}} bio-digestion {{systems for}} the treatment of wastes from agro-industrial activities has been intensified. The main products of bio-digestion are biogas and bio-fertilizer. Biogas is composed mainly of methane (CH 4), carbon dioxide (CO 2), hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) and ammonia (NH 3), which in most cases is used as fuel for powering stationary engines. In these cases, the presence of CO 2, H 2 S and NH 3, undermines the viability of its use as fuel because it reduces the <b>calorific</b> <b>potential</b> and lifetime of engines. In this context, the study aimed to develop and evaluate an alternative technology for purification of the methane contained in biogas from anaerobic digestion of swine manure. Therefore, the methodology contemplated the technological foresight inherent in matter (removal / purification of biogas), identifying advantages / disadvantages, design / construction of alternative technology (prototype) and its installation on a rural property for the purpose of operational testing. The results demonstrate the technical and economical viability for implementation in a real situation. For the corrosive components the reduction of 96 % for H 2 S and of 83, 1 % for NH 3 was achieved, beyond 6 % CO 2 reduction. The result was the increasing of methane concentration which reached 75 % enabling the use of the biogas as a fuel...|$|E

This study investigated the potential use of bio-briquettes that are produced from the waste biomass of the following tropical fruits: durian (Durio zibethinus), coconut (Cocos nucifera), coffee (Coffea arabica), cacao (Theobroma cacao), banana (Musa acuminata) and rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum). All fruit waste biomass samples exhibited an extremely high level of initial moisture content (78. 22 % in average). Fruit samples with the highest proportion of fruit waste biomass (of total unprocessed fruit mass) were represented by cacao (83. 82 %), durian (62. 56 %) and coconut (56. 83 %). Highest energy <b>potentials</b> (<b>calorific</b> value) of fruit waste biomass were observed in case of coconut (18. 22 MJ∙kg− 1), banana (17. 79 MJ∙kg− 1) and durian (17. 60 MJ∙kg− 1) fruit samples, whereas fruit waste biomass with the lowest level of ash content originated from the rambutan (3. 67 %), coconut (4. 52 %), and durian (5. 05 %) fruit samples. When investigating the energy demands to produce bio-briquettes from such feedstock materials, the best results (lowest amount of required deformation energy in combination with highest level of bio-briquette bulk density) were achieved by the rambutan, durian and banana fruit waste biomass samples. Finally, all investigated bio-briquette samples presented satisfactory levels of bulk density (> 1050 kg∙m− 3). In conclusion, our results indicated the practicability and viability of such bio-briquette fuel production, as well as supporting the fact that bio-briquettes from tropical fruit waste biomass can offer a potentially attractive energy source with many benefits, especially in rural areas...|$|R
