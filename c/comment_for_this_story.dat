5000|$|The authors {{actually}} {{traveled to}} El Salvador and interviewed the locals who are {{directly involved in}} the drama. According to an IPS article of September, 2014, [...] "Last year, OceanaGold purchased Pacific Rim, despite the latter’s primary asset being the El Salvador gold-mining project, which has never been allowed to go forward. Although OceanaGold did not respond to a request for <b>comment</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> last year the company noted that it would continue with the arbitration case while also seeking [...] "a negotiated resolution to the … permitting impasse". For its part, the Salvadoran government says it has halted the permitting process not only over environmental and health concerns but also over procedural matters. While these include Pacific Rim’s failure to abide by certain reporting requirements, the company also appears not to have gained important local approvals. Under Salvadoran law, an extractive company needs to gain titles, or local permission, for any lands it wants to develop. Yet Pacific Rim had such access to just 13 percent of the lands covered by its proposal, according to Oxfam America, a humanitarian and advocacy group.".|$|E
