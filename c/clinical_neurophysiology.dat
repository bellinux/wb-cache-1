25|$|<b>Clinical</b> <b>neurophysiology</b> is {{concerned}} with testing the physiology or function of the central and peripheral aspects of the nervous system. These kinds of tests {{can be divided into}} recordings of: (1) spontaneous or continuously running electrical activity, or (2) stimulus evoked responses. Subspecialties include electroencephalography, electromyography, evoked potential, nerve conduction study and polysomnography.

25|$|Neurology, psychiatry, neurosurgery, psychosurgery, {{anesthesiology}} {{and pain}} medicine, neuropathology, neuroradiology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, <b>clinical</b> <b>neurophysiology,</b> addiction medicine, and sleep medicine are some medical specialties that specifically address the {{diseases of the}} nervous system. These terms also refer to clinical disciplines involving {{diagnosis and treatment of}} these diseases. Neurology works with diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and stroke, and their medical treatment. Psychiatry focuses on affective, behavioral, cognitive, and perceptual disorders. Anesthesiology focuses on perception of pain, and pharmacologic alteration of consciousness. Neuropathology focuses upon the classification and underlying pathogenic mechanisms of central and peripheral nervous system and muscle diseases, with an emphasis on morphologic, microscopic, and chemically observable alterations. Neurosurgery and psychosurgery work primarily with surgical treatment of diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems. The boundaries between these specialties have been blurring recently as they are all influenced by basic research in neuroscience. Brain imaging also enables objective, biological insights into mental illness, which can lead to faster diagnosis, more accurate prognosis, and help assess patient progress over time.|$|E

40|$|Iatrogenic or {{incidental}} dural tear is {{a relatively}} common complication in lumbar decompression surgery. Although mostly there are no changes that occurred in long-term result following an incidental durotomy, the sequelae are not always benign especially when the herniated nerve root is involved.

Direct watertight repair was performed using the preservation and tissue handling concept. Assessing the relative size between the dural tear and the root mass is the key in determining whether enlargement of tear is needed. Whenever feasible, the tear will not be enlarged.

40|$|Background: Myoclonus {{may occur}} after hypoxia. In 1963, Lance and Adams {{described}} persistent myoclonus with other features after hypoxia. However, myoclonus occurring immediately after hypoxia may demonstrate different syndromic features from classic Lance–Adams syndrome (LAS). The {{aim of this}} review is to provide up-to-date information about the spectrum of myoclonus occurring after hypoxia with emphasis on neurophysiological features. Methods: A literature search was performed on PubMed database from 1960 to 2015. The following search terms were used: “myoclonus,” “post anoxic myoclonus,” “post hypoxic myoclonus,” and “Lance Adams syndrome. ” The articles describing <b>clinical</b> features, <b>neurophysiology,</b> management, and prognosis of post-hypoxic myoclonus cases were included for review. Results: Several reports in the literature were separated clinically into “acute post-hypoxic myoclonus,” which occurred within hours of severe hypoxia, and “chronic post-hypoxic myoclonus,” which occurred with some recovery of mental status as the LAS. Acute post-hypoxic myoclonus was generalized {{in the setting of}} coma. Chronic post-hypoxic myoclonus presented as multifocal cortical action myoclonus that was significantly disabling. There was overlap of neurophysiological findings for these two syndromes but also different features. Treatment options for these two distinct clinical–neurophysiologic post-hypoxic myoclonus syndromes were approached differently. Discussion: The review of clinical and neurophysiological findings suggests that myoclonus after hypoxia manifests in one or a combination of distinct syndromes: acute and/or chronic myoclonus. The mechanism of post-hypoxic myoclonus may arise either from cortical and/or subcortical structures. More research is needed to clarify mechanisms and treatment of post-hypoxic myoclonus. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Detecting acute nerve {{compression}} using neurophysiologic studies {{is an important}} part of the practice of <b>clinical</b> intra-operative <b>neurophysiology.</b> The goal of this paper was to study the changes in the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) during acute mechanical compression. This is the type of injury most likely to occur during surgery. Thus, understanding the changes in the CMAP during this type of injury will be useful in the detection and prevention using intra-operative neurophysiologic monitoring. The model involved compression of the hamster sciatic nerve over a region of 1. 3 mm with pressures up to 2000 mmHg for times on the order of 3 minutes. In this model CMAP amplitude dropped to 50 % of its baseline value when a pressure of roughly 1000 mmHg is applied while, at the same time, nerve conduction velocities decline by only 5 %. The ability to detect statistically significant changes in the CMAP at low force levels using other descriptors of the CMAP including duration, latency variation, etc alone or in conjunction with amplitude and velocity measures was investigated. However, these other parameters did not allow for earlier detection of significant changes. This study focused on a model in which nerve injury on a short time scale is purely mechanical in origin. It demonstrated that a pure compression injury produced large changes in CMAP amplitude prior to large changes in conduction velocity. On the other hand, ischemic and stretch injuries are associated with larger changes in conduction velocity for a given value of CMAP amplitude reduction. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{review the}} data {{concerning}} the neurophysiology of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in humans, especially in reference to Parkinson's disease. The electric field generated by DBS interacts with the brain in complex ways, and several variables could influence the DBS-induced biophysical and <b>clinical</b> effects. The <b>neurophysiology</b> of DBS comprises the DBS-induced effects per se as well as neurophysiological studies designed to record electrical activity directly from the basal ganglia (single-unit or local field potential) through the electrodes implanted for DBS. In the subthalamic nucleus, DBS locally excites and concurrently inhibits at single-unit level, synchronizes low-frequency activity, and desynchronizes beta activity and also induces neurochemical changes in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and GABA concentrations. DBS-induced effects at system level can be studied through evoked potentials, autonomic tests, spinal cord segmental system, motor cortical and brainstem excitability, gait, and decision-making tasks. All these variables are influenced by DBS, suggesting also distant effects on nonmotor structures of the brain.

40|$|When {{future generations}} {{look back and}} {{describe}} the develop-ment of anaesthesia {{one of the key}} themes from our time will be that we formalized the importance of learning from our errors. Indeed, there is currently great interest in the evalu-ation of human error in anaesthesia, with a focus on promoting training and research into ‘human factors’. However, by turning to cognitive neuroscience, it may be appreciated that there is a rich literature exploring the neural underpinnings of human error, and its complex relationship with behaviour. Cognitive neuroscience Cognitive neuroscience is grounded in the philosophical and psychological traditions of exploring how complex mental functions enable high-level human thought. During the 20 th century, the fields of cognitive psychology and neuropsych-ology became particularly influential, and there was obvious benefit to be gained from integrating these disciplines with neuroscience which focused on brain anatomy and physi-ology. Since the 1990 s (declared as the ‘Decade of the Brain’ in the USA) the newly developing field of cognitive neurosci-ence has benefitted worldwide from increasing recognition. In particular, there was improved access to neuroimaging techniques and with it the promotion of cross-discipline ex-pertise: medical imaging, <b>neurophysiology,</b> <b>clinical</b> psych-ology, computer science, to name a few. In short, cognitive neuroscience had set-forth to integrate knowledge from multiple-related disciplines in order to improve understand-ing of structural and functional relationships in the human brain.

40|$|A new {{framework}} is described for managing uncertainty and for deahng with artefact corruption to introduce objectivity {{in the interpretation}} of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Conventionally, EEG interpretation is time consuming and subjective, and is known to show significant inter- and intra-personnel variation. A need thus exists to automate the interpretation of the EEG to provide a more consistent and efficient assessment. However, automated analysis of EEGs by computers is complicated by two major factors. The difficulty of adequately capturing in machine form, the skills and subjective expertise of the experienced electroencephalbgrapher, and the lack of a reliable means of dealing with the range of EEG artefacts (signal contamination). In this thesis, a new {{framework is}} described which introduces objectivity in two important outcomes of clinical evaluation of the EEG, namely, the clinical factual report and the clinical 'conclusion', by capturing the subjective expertise of the electroencephalographer and dealing with the problem of artefact corruption. The framework is separated into two stages. to assist piecewise optimisation and to cater for different requirements. The first stage, 'quantitative analysis', relies on novel digital signal processing algorithms and cluster analysis techniques to reduce data and identify and describe background activities in the EEG. To deal with artefact corruption, an artefact removal strategy, based on new reUable techniques for artefact identification is used to ensure that artefact-free activities only are used in the analysis. The outcome is a quantitative analysis, which efficiently describes the background activity in the record, and can support future <b>clinical</b> investigations in <b>neurophysiology.</b> In <b>clinical</b> practice, many of the EEG features are described by the clinicians in natural language terms, such as very high, extremely irregular, somewhat abnormal etc. The second stage of the framework, 'qualitative analysis', captures the subjectivity and linguistic uncertainty expressed. by the clinical experts, using novel, intelligent models, based on fuzzy logic, to provide an analysis closely comparable to the clinical interpretation made in practice. The outcome of this stage is an EEG report with qualitative descriptions to complement the quantitative analysis. The system was evaluated using EEG records from 1 patient with Alzheimer's disease and 2 age-matched normal controls for the factual report, and 3 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 7 age-matched nonnal controls for the 'conclusion'. Good agreement was found between factual reports produced by the system and factual reports produced by qualified clinicians. Further, the 'conclusion' produced by the system achieved 100 % discrimination between the two subject groups. After a thorough evaluation, the system should significantly aid the process of EEG interpretation and diagnosis...|$|R
