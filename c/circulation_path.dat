The circulation problems were addressed by re-arranging the feedwater pipes and by placing baffles inside the steam drum, so as to give a more clearly defined circulation. A circulation augmenter, a steel trough, was placed over the tops of the furnace-side tubes, encouraging a single central upwelling flow to above the water level, encouraging steam bubbles to escape and acting as a steam separator before the water re-circulated down the outer-side tubes. In a manner similar to work taking place around the same time on the LMS railway and the development of top feed for steam locomotives, the feedwater was also routed upwards through 'spray pots' and thus passed through the steam space as droplets. The cold feedwater was thus heated to the same temperature as the boiler water before mixing with it, avoiding disturbance to the <b>circulation</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E

50|$|In a synchrotron, this {{adaptation}} {{is done by}} {{variation of}} the magnetic field strength in time, rather than in space. For particles that are not close to the speed of light, {{the frequency of the}} applied electromagnetic field may also change to follow their non-constant circulation time.

This allows the vacuum chamber for the particles to be a large thin torus, rather than a disk as in previous, compact accelerator designs.

50|$|Passive {{learning}} and direct instruction are teacher-centered pedagogies that are characterized as 'sage on the stage'. They {{are the most}} common form of instruction in historic and current learning spaces that are typified by the standard classroom model: space for 15 to 40 students and one instructor; a fixed teaching station or teaching wall with a writing or display surface composed of one or more blackboards or whiteboards; and students sitting at desks, tables, or benches, traditionally arranged in rows facing the teaching wall; one wall with windows; one interior wall backing onto a corridor or outdoor <b>circulation</b> <b>path,</b> with a door, and typically without glass to minimize student distraction; wall surfaces may have additional display or writing surfaces for lessons or instructional material; a counter with a sink for lower-level grades who might take art classes in this room; and in the lower grades, cabinets or cubbies for student coats and books. Historically the furniture in school classrooms would have been fixed, as it typically was and continues to be in lecture halls with stepped, sloping, or tiered theater-type seating. In religious spaces such as churches, the instructional station is at or near the altar or the pulpit with the learners seated in rows of chairs or pews facing the speaker. This prescribed uni-directional format facing the instructor supports direct instruction by having instructors and learners face-to-face; opportunities for interaction between students is limited.|$|E

40|$|Figure 1 : Continuous gait {{motion is}} {{synthesized}} by circulating through a motion ring while a <b>circulation</b> <b>path</b> is controlled to obey user input within the quarter gait cycle. The gait controller also optimizes the <b>circulation</b> <b>path</b> {{to establish the}} ground contact constraints by detecting the terrain surface using precomputed spheres. This paper presents a practical system for synthesizing gait animation in game environments. As well as improving the reality of animation, we should improve the efficiency and the maneuverability of the character, {{both of which are}} essential for interactive games. Our system supplies these practical demands by integrating a motion interpolation technique and a sampling-based control mechanism. We introduce a parameterized looped motion data structure, called a motion ring, for synthesizing a variety of cyclic motions. A continuous gait motion is synthesized by circulating through the motion ring while the interpolation parameter is adaptively controlled according to the terrain condition. The gait controller uses a sampling-based precomputation technique which efficiently searches natural foot contact on terrain of an arbitrary surface shape. The interpolation parameter is also controlled to obey the user control within the duration of quarter gait cycle. Although our system slightly sacrifices the physical correctness of the synthesized motion in order to quickly respond to user input, critical visual artifacts such as foot-skating and jerky movement are prevented. We demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of our integrated system by interactively navigating the character on complex, uneven terrain...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLife cycle {{design is}} a {{promising}} approach for introducing efficient resource circulation. In such design, there are difficulties in balancing demand and supply for resources throughout product life cycles. For the resource balance, {{it is important}} to design a product life cycle focusing on individual products and their parts, since they change their states diversely and flow along different <b>circulation</b> <b>paths</b> through their life cycles. This paper proposes a modelling method for the individual products and parts in addition to its design information. The design information is the nominal information of the product specified by designers. To achieve this, this paper defines three models; hierarchical structure model, life cycle flow model, and entity information model. Hierarchical structure model represents design information of a product. Life cycle flow model represents a network of processes included in product life cycles. Entity information model represents information of individual products and parts. The information indicates when each product and part flows along which <b>circulation</b> <b>paths</b> in which state. With this information, this method represents resource balance throughout product life cycles. Moreover, this study employs life cycle simulation technique to derive the entity information model from the hierarchical structure model and life cycle flow model.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} is human communication in urban spaces {{and its relation to}} built form. The study endeavors to illustrate that urban form and place are able to promote direct human interaction. Sociable spaces are examined within public open spaces of two of Philadelphia 2 ̆ 7 s Squares: Rittenhouse and Washington Square. The study of the forces of spatial appeal and their characteristics in these open spaces points to various participating elements which include: the socio-economic environment of the Squares, perimeter buildings, and landscape layouts. The spatial appeal of these two Squares is primarily an outcome of the positive interaction of physical built form and the social context. Physical form plays a decisive role: although social and economical diversity of a place draw a crowd built form makes for an inviting and sociable environment. The exploration of the architectural significance of the sites pointed to the important aspects of enclosure, landscape layout, physical aspect of location, spatial definition and boundary. The primary issue, however, deals with the concept of enclosure and its relation with boundary and perception of object in space. Various types of enclosure in Rittenhouse Square have bounded the space and with their varied characters created differentiated territories.

Firstly, the formation energy of different local Vo clusters was calculated in four established orientation systems. Then, the optimized orientation and charger conductor shape were identified by comparing the isosurface plots of partial charge density, formation energy, and the highest isosurface value of oxygen vacancy. The calculated results revealed that the [010] orientation was the optimal migration path of Vo, and the shape of system D 4 was the best charge conductor in HfO 2, which effectively influenced the SET voltage, formation voltage and the ON/OFF ratio of the device. Afterwards, the PDOS of Hf near Vo and total density of states of the system D 4 _ 010 were obtained, revealing the composition of charge conductor was oxygen vacancy instead of metal Hf.

2500|$|In the 1920s, {{the ideas}} of modernism began to surface in urban planning. The {{influential}} modernist architect Le Corbusier presented his scheme for a [...] "Contemporary City" [...] for three million inhabitants (Ville Contemporaine) in 1922. The centrepiece of this plan was the group of sixty-story cruciform skyscrapers, steel-framed office buildings encased in huge curtain walls of glass. These skyscrapers were set within large, rectangular, park-like green spaces. At the centre was a huge transportation hub that on different levels included depots for buses and trains, as well as highway intersections, and at the top, an airport. Le Corbusier had the fanciful notion that commercial airliners would land between the huge skyscrapers. He segregated pedestrian <b>circulation</b> <b>paths</b> from the roadways and glorified the automobile {{as a means of}} transportation.
