5000|$|Blow back - For oxidizers that {{decompose}} exothermically such as {{nitrous oxide}} or hydrogen peroxide, flame or hot gasses from the combustion chamber can propagate {{back through the}} injector, igniting the oxidizer and leading to a tank explosion. Blow-back requires gases to flow back through the injector due to insufficient pressure drop which can occur during periods of unstable <b>combustion.</b> <b>Blow</b> back is inherent to specific oxidizers and is not possible with oxidizers such as oxygen or nitrogen tetroxide unless fuel {{is present in the}} oxidizer tank.|$|E

50|$|This poor {{combustion}} {{leads to}} soot formation and unburnt fuel residues which clogs and gums piston rings, causing a further drop in sealing efficiency and exacerbates the initial low pressure. Glazing occurs when hot <b>combustion</b> gases <b>blow</b> past the now poorly-sealing piston rings, causing the lubricating {{oil on the}} cylinder walls to 'flash burn', creating an enamel-like glaze which smooths the bore and removes {{the effect of the}} intricate pattern of honing marks machined into the bore surface which are there to hold oil and return it to the crankcase via the scraper ring.|$|R
50|$|The {{hot blast}} technique, {{in which the}} hot flue gas from a blast furnace is used to preheat <b>combustion</b> air <b>blown</b> into a blast furnace, was invented and {{patented}} by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828 at Wilsontown Ironworks in Scotland. Hot blast was {{the single most important}} advance in fuel efficiency of the blast furnace as it greatly reduced the fuel consumption for making pig iron, {{and was one of the}} most important technologies developed during the Industrial Revolution. Falling costs for producing wrought iron coincided with the emergence of the railway in the 1830s.|$|R
50|$|The Roots Blower Company was an American {{engineering}} {{company based in}} Connersville, Indiana. It was founded in 1859 by the inventors Philander Higley Roots and Francis Marion Roots. It is notable for the Roots blower, a type of pump. Today, Roots blowers are mainly used as air pumps in superchargers for internal combustion engines; they were first used in blast furnaces to <b>blow</b> <b>combustion</b> air to melt iron.|$|R
50|$|Pellet grills {{have their}} {{beginnings}} in pellet stoves. During the 1970s oil crisis, an {{increased demand for}} affordable home heating spearheaded a push toward alternative heat sources. One such alternative was wood pellets. Invented in the United States in the late 1970s, wood pellets are small eraser-sized capsules made of compressed sawdust. By the early 1980s, two men, Jerry Whitfield, a Boeing Aircraft engineer from Washington, and Joe Traeger, who ran a family-owned heating company in Oregon, were each experimenting with pellet-burning stoves. Although the stoves looked like traditional wood stoves, they worked much differently. Run by electricity, the pellet stoves utilized a motor-driven auger to deliver a specific amount of pellets from the storage hopper to a fire pot, where a fan aided <b>combustion</b> and <b>blew</b> the warm air from the stove.|$|R
50|$|As first developed, {{it worked}} by {{alternately}} storing {{heat from the}} furnace flue gas in a firebrick-lined vessel with multiple chambers, then <b>blowing</b> <b>combustion</b> air through the hot chamber. This is known as regenerative heating. Hot blast was invented and patented for iron furnaces by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828 at Wilsontown Ironworks in Scotland, but was later applied in other contexts, including late bloomeries. Later the carbon monoxide in the flue gas was burned to provide additional heat.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the {{developments}} {{leading to the}} use of pulverized coal most boilers utilized grate firing where the fuel was mechanically distributed onto a moving grate {{at the bottom of the}} firebox in a partially crushed gravel like form. Air for <b>combustion</b> was <b>blown</b> upward through the grate carrying the lighter ash and smaller particles of unburned coal up with it, some of which would adhere to the sides of the firebox. In 1918 The Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company, later Wisconsin Electric, conducted tests in the use of pulverized coal at its Oneida Street power plant. These experiments helped Fred L. Dornbrook to develop methods of controlling the pulverized coal's tarry ash residues with boiler feed water tube jackets that served to reduce the surface temperature of the firebox walls and allowed the ash deposits be easily removed. This plant became the first central power station in the United States to use pulverized fuel.|$|R

60|$|There {{is another}} {{experiment}} by which I will shew you its weight. I have here a jar suspended {{at one end}} of a balance--it is now equipoised; but when I pour this carbonic acid into the jar on the one side which now contains air, you will see it sink down at once, because of the carbonic acid that I pour into it. And now, if I examine this jar with the lighted taper, I shall find that the carbonic acid has fallen into it, and it no longer has any power of supporting the <b>combustion.</b> If I <b>blow</b> a soap-bubble, which of course will be filled with air, and let it fall into this jar of carbonic acid, it will float.|$|R
40|$|Driven under {{difficult}} field conditions, the Army Jeep shown went {{more than}} 22, 000 miles without an oil {{change in a}} test conducted by the U. S. Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Command. Key to this exceptionally long oil life was a set of piston ring seals made of a new synthetic rubber formula called RC- 34; the seal pictured, photographed after its arduous Army trial, {{shows no signs of}} deterioration. The seal and the RC- 34 material, which may soon be available for use in the family auto, were developed by Ramsey Corporation, St. Louis, Missouri, a division of TRW Automotive Worldwide. The oil in an automobile engine must be I replaced every few thousand miles not because it wears out but because it becomes contaminated. The contamination sources are gasoline and <b>combustion</b> gases which <b>blow</b> by the piston rings to mix with the oil, reducing the oil's ability to lubricate properly. Seeking to prolong oil life by eliminating "blowby," Ramsey Corporation looked for a better way to seal piston rings and used NASA technology as a departure point. The parent company TRW, under contract to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, had developed seals and bladders from a type of material called elastomers which where designed to withstand the environmental extremes of interplanetary flight. That effort formed a knowledge base for research which culminated in Ramsey's RC- 34 elastomer...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{levels of}} blast furnace coal {{injection}} {{are needed to}} further lower coke requirements and provide more flexibility in furnace productivity. The direct injection of high temperature oxygen with coal in the blast furnace blowpipe and tuyere offers better coal dispersion at high local oxygen concentrations, optimizing the use of oxygen in the blast furnace. Based on pilot scale tests, coal injection can be increased by 75 pounds per ton of hot metal (lb/thm), yielding net savings of $ 0. 84 /tm. Potential productivity increases of 15 percent would yield another $ 1. 95 /thm. In this project, commercial-scale hot oxygen injection from a ''thermal nozzle'' system, patented by Praxair, Inc., has been developed, integrated into, and demonstrated on two tuyeres of the U. S. Steel Gary Works no. 6 blast furnace. The goals were to evaluate heat load on furnace components from hot oxygen injection, demonstrate a safe and reliable lance and flow control design, and qualitatively observe hot oxygen-coal interaction. All three goals have been successfully met. Heat load on the blowpipe is essentially unchanged with hot oxygen. Total heat load on the tuyere increases about 10 % and heat load on the tuyere tip increases about 50 %. Bosh temperatures remained within the usual operating range. Performance in all these areas is acceptable. Lance performance was improved during testing by changes to lance materials and operating practices. The lance fuel tip was changed from copper to a nickel alloy to eliminate oxidation problems that severely limited tip life. Ignition flow rates and oxygen-fuel ratios were changed to counter the effects of blowpipe pressure fluctuations caused by natural resonance and by coal/coke combustion in the tuyere and raceway. Lances can now be reliably ignited using the hot blast as the ignition source. Blowpipe pressures were analyzed to evaluate ht oxygen-coal interactions. The data suggest that hot oxygen increases coal <b>combustion</b> in the <b>blow</b> pipe and tuyere by 30, in line with pilot scale tests conducted previously...|$|R
