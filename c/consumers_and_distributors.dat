5000|$|The {{initiative}} was groundbreaking {{as for the}} first time Fairtrade coffee was sold in supermarkets and mass-retailers, therefore reaching a larger consumer segment. Fairtrade labelling also allowed <b>consumers</b> <b>and</b> <b>distributors</b> alike to track the origin of the goods to confirm that the products were really benefiting the farmers {{at the end of the}} supply chain.The {{initiative was}} a great success and was replicated in several other markets: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America, called [...] "Max Havelaar" [...] (in Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and France), [...] "Transfair" [...] (in Germany, Austria, Luxembourg, Italy, the United States, Canada and Japan), or carrying a national name: [...] "Fairtrade Mark" [...] in the UK and Ireland, [...] "Rättvisemärkt" [...] in Sweden, and [...] "Reilu Kauppa" [...] in Finland.Initially, the Max Havelaars and the Transfairs each had their own Fairtrade standards, product committees and monitoring systems. In 1994, a process of convergence among the labelling organizations - or [...] "LIs" [...] (for [...] "Labelling Initiatives") - started with the establishment of a TransMax working group, culminating in 1997 in the creation of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (FLO). FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.|$|E

Drawing on eighteen months of fieldwork in Jordan, the following empirical sections examine the {{different ways in which}} bureaucrats, bakers and ordinary citizens portray the government’s universal subsidy of Arabic bread. Here, I will unpack the diverse opinions encountered and discuss their links to the Hashemite regime’s polyvalent legitimating discourse. The article then dissects the politics of provisions that contribute to the bread subsidy’s paradoxical persistence. It concludes by considering the relationship between moral economies, opposition politics and authoritarian power in the context of Jordan’s ongoing food subsidy debate.

In Japan, {{external}} appearance quality inspection by image processing, and internal nondestructive quality inspection using near infrared spectroscopy and density {{have been put}} into practice for many agricultural products. For melons, {{external appearance}} of color and damage as well as sugar content are being inspected. As melons soften easily and are expensive, their softening or decaying during distribution would result in large financial losses. It is important, therefore, to predict keeping quality after shipment. Prediction of the optimum eating firmness by nondestructive inspection could bring a profit to <b>consumers</b> <b>and</b> <b>distributors.</b> In this study, {{the experiments were conducted}} in order to investigate the relationship between fruit density of melon and softening rate as well as the relationship between transmitted light level of melon and storage time. As a result, it became clear that there was a correlation between fruit density and softening rate measured by fruit pressure tester, and the softening rate of high-density melon was faster than that of low-density melon. Generally, the transmitted light level increases when the fruit soften. A high sensitivity camera took photographs using light transmitted through melons during the ripening and softening stages, and concurring results were documented. Therefore, the ripeness level at the time of shipment can be estimated using the transmitted light level, and the softening rate can be estimated using the fruit density measured nondestructively in packinghouse. By combining these methods, the time to reach optimum eating firmness after the shipment can be predicted...|$|E

During the past few years, copyright owners of music, movies and other media have seen how piracy has increased with the introduction of affordable broadband technology.

They want their customers to pay for and then enjoy the digital media but at the same time protect the rights of the copyright owner. That is what Digital Rights Management is all about; protect the copyright owner while allowing the consumer to enjoy their digital media. Digital Rights Management can restrict the users rights to copy and transfer the contents to other devices as well as restrict the number of times a user is allowed to use the media. The present DRM systems are focusing on preventing digital media from being freely distributed by limiting the ability to copy or move the media.

40|$|The {{issue of}} Power Quality is very {{important}} to both the <b>consumers</b> <b>and</b> the <b>distributors</b> of electric power. There are many facets of power quality disturbances and each has its own source and mitigation techniques. The first step towards any solution for a disturbance is to recognize the presence of a particular type of disturbance and locate its source. Conventional methods for recognition of a power quality disturbance consists of collecting operating data, inspecting the wave forms visually and then identifying any disturbance that may be present in the data. Although the available measuring and recording devices offer substantial help, the process is, in the main, very slow. At the University of Tasmania, a project is under way to automatize this process. The ultimate goal is to develop an Automatic Disturbance Recognition System (ADRS).

The case company is a medium-sized high-tech <b>consumer</b> goods producer <b>and</b> <b>distributor.</b> The company has a few production plants and distribution centres and a number of warehouses all over the globe. The marketing function sets demands for logistics concerning product availability in local warehouses and the variety of product mix etc. From the logistics point of view those demands are quite expensive to fulfil. On the other hand, marketing provides important information for logistics. For example, the quality of forecasts and the feasible length of order cycle are dependent on marketing...|$|R
