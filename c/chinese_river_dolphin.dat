5|$|Four {{families}} of river dolphins (Iniidae, Pontoporiidae, Lipotidae and Platanistidae) are currently recognized, comprising three superfamilies (Inioidea, Lipotoidea and Platanistoidea). Platanistidae, containing the two subspecies of South Asian river dolphin, {{is the only}} accepted family of Platanistoidea. Previously, many taxonomists had assigned all river dolphins to a single family, Platanistidae, and treated the Ganges and Indus River dolphins as separate species. A December 2006 survey found no members of Lipotes vexillifer (commonly known as the baiji, or <b>Chinese</b> <b>river</b> <b>dolphin)</b> and declared the species functionally extinct. With their disappearance, one of the recently accepted superfamilies, Lipotoidea, has become extinct.|$|E
25|$|Dolphins are {{a widely}} {{distributed}} and {{diverse group of}} aquatic mammals. They are an informal grouping within the order Cetacea, excluding whales and porpoises, so to zoologists the grouping is paraphyletic. The dolphins comprise the extant families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the new world river dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji or <b>Chinese</b> <b>river</b> <b>dolphin).</b> There are 40 extant species of dolphins. Dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates. Cetaceans' closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago.|$|E

5000|$|Shishou ( [...] ; [...] ) is a county-level city {{under the}} {{administration}} of the prefectural-level city Jingzhou, in the south of Hubei province, China, near its border with Hunan province. Located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and on the shores of Dongting Lake, Shishou is known as a land overflowing with rice and fish. The Swan Islet Wetland of the Yangtze River in this area is the world’s largest national natural reserve both for wild elks(Milu, or David Deer) and for <b>Chinese</b> <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> (finless porpoises). The Shishou City National Baiji Reserve for <b>Chinese</b> <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> is nearby. It shares its name with a stream flowing into the Yangtze River. In addition, the area enjoys convenient transportation, with an hour’s drive from Yueyang East Railway Station on the Beijing-Guangzhou high-speed railway line (90 kilometers of expressway), and 70 kilometers from Jingzhou Railway Station on the Shanghai-Wuhan-Chengdu high-speed railway line. Moreover, Shishou boasts a diversified landscape, including mountains, hills, lakes, rivers, terraces and plains, as well as abundant resources such as rice, cotton, oil plants, eggs, fish, and lotus roots.|$|R
5000|$|The Xinhua News Agency {{announced}} on December 4, 2006 that no <b>Chinese</b> <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> were detected in a six-week {{survey of the}} Yangtze River conducted by 30 researchers. The failure of the Yangtze Freshwater Dolphin Expedition (...) raised suspicions of the first unequivocal extinction of a cetacean species due to human action (some extinct baleen whale populations {{might not have been}} distinct species). Poor water and weather conditions may have prevented sightings, but expedition leaders declared it [...] "functionally extinct" [...] on December 13, 2006, as fewer are likely to be alive than are needed to propagate the species. However, footage believed to be a baiji from August 2007 was released to the public.|$|R
5000|$|The Cantonese {{language}} has a slang expression wu gei bak gei (often written as 烏忌白忌, [...] "black taboo white taboo") which means {{someone or something}} is a bad omen or a nuisance. The phrase originates from the Cantonese fisher people, because they claim the dolphins eat the fish in their nets. However, in formal Chinese, it should be written as 烏鱀白鱀, with the gei originally in olden Chinese, meaning dolphins. The wu refers to the finless porpoises, which are black, and the bak, white, referring to <b>Chinese</b> <b>river</b> <b>dolphins.</b> These two species often interrupt and ruin the fishermen's catch. As years passed, because [...] "dolphin" [...] sounds the same as [...] "bad luck", {{the meaning of the}} phrase changed. However, in Cantonese, wu refers to the calves of Chinese white dolphin and bak refers to the adults. Nowadays, dolphins are not called gei anymore, but 海豚 (hai tun), literally meaning [...] "sea pig", with none of the negative connotations for pig found in English.|$|R
500|$|Cetaceans are {{characterized}} by a [...] body, paddle-shaped front limbs and vestigial hind limbs. Their tails have been flattened into flukes to aid propulsion. They have lungs, and must surface regularly to breathe air through blowholes (modified nostrils) situated {{on the top of}} the cranium. The cetaceans are included in the order Cetartiodactyla with the Artiodactyla (the even-toed ungulates). Previously, they were placed within their own order, Cetacea, now an infraorder. They are divided into two subgroups, the Odontoceti (the toothed whales, including dolphins and porpoises) and the Mysticeti (the baleen whales), formerly suborders but now considered parvorders or unranked taxa. There are 89 living species of cetaceans (including the functionally extinct <b>Chinese</b> <b>river</b> <b>dolphin).</b> [...] In addition, numerous species of extinct cetaceans have been documented, but they are not listed here. This list contains only the known, extant cetacean species including several recently defined species.|$|E
500|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{potential}} wildlife impact of the dam predate the National People's Congress's approval in 1992. This region {{has long been known}} for its rich biodiversity. It is home to 6,388 species of plants, which belong to 238 families and 1508 genera. Of these plant species, 57 percent are endangered. These rare species are also used as ingredients in traditional Chinese medicines. Already, the percentage of forested area in the region surrounding the Three Gorges Dam has dropped from twenty percent in 1950 to less than ten percent as of 2002, negatively affecting all plant species in this locality. The region also provides habitats to hundreds of freshwater and terrestrial animal species. Freshwater fish are especially affected by dams due to changes in the water temperature and flow regime. Many other fish are hurt in the turbine blades of the hydroelectric plants as well. This is particularly detrimental to the ecosystem of the region because the Yangtze River basin is home to 361 different fish species and accounts for twenty-seven percent of all endangered freshwater fish species in China. Other aquatic species have been endangered by the dam, particularly the baiji, or <b>Chinese</b> <b>river</b> <b>dolphin,</b> [...] now extinct. In fact, Government Chinese scholars even claim that the Three Gorges Dam directly caused the extinction of the baiji.|$|E
