Now, the process grouped the shovel nodes to define {{the route of the}} transport of greater capacity that would be possible. In this procedure we also defined the optimal routes of travel, the loads and volumes to be transported and the sequence of the route to comply with the time windows imposed in each cluster. Here, it was taken care that the transport had capacity to carry the shipload and the total volume required in each cluster found. In both areas the type of vehicle that complied with the access restrictions was favored, minimizing the number of them to avoid increasing the mileage of the route. The final report yielded the following results per month.|$|E

40|$|Excessive {{leverage}} and risk-taking {{by large}} international banks {{were the main}} causes of the 2008 - 09 financial crisis and the ensuing sharp drop in economic activity and employment.

Accordingly, the authors propose the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>requirements</b> without risk adjustment and creation of a system of mandated action by supervisors modelled on the US framework of Prompt Corrective Action (PCA).

40|$|When formulating least-cost poultry diets, ME {{concentration}} {{should be}} optimised by an iterative procedure, not entered as a fixed value. This iteration must calculate profit margins by {{taking into account}} the way in which feed intake and saleable outputs vary with ME concentration. In the case of broilers, adjustment of critical amino acid contents in direct proportion to ME concentration does not result in birds of equal fatness. To avoid an increase in fat deposition at higher energy levels, it is proposed that amino acid specifications should be adjusted in proportion to changes in the net energy supplied by the feed. A model is available which will both interpret responses to amino acids in laying trials and give economically optimal estimates of amino acid inputs for practical feed formulation. Flocks coming into lay and flocks nearing the end of the pullet year have bimodal distributions of rates of lay, with the result that <b>calculations</b> <b>of</b> <b>requirement</b> based on mean output will underestimate the optimal amino acid input for the flock.
