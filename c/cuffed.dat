40|$|Accuracy {{of blood}} {{pressure}} (BP) measurement with any method {{is affected by}} <b>cuff</b> size. Narrow <b>cuff</b> overestimates BP and wide <b>cuff</b> underestimates BP. Wrist <b>cuff</b> oscillometric BP monitors typically use narrow <b>cuffs</b> with bladders about 6 cm wide. The segment of the radial artery compressed by the wrist <b>cuff</b> presents a hydraulic resistance (Rc) to blood flow during BP measurement. Narrow <b>cuff</b> presents smaller Rc than wide <b>cuff.</b> Changes in Rc alter the amplitude envelope of oscillometric waveforms. Narrow <b>cuff</b> allows blood flow under the <b>cuff</b> and into the hand sooner than wide <b>cuff.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to demonstrate that narrow <b>cuff</b> alters the amplitude envelope in a manner that results in increased BP values when characteristic ratio algorithm is used. A specialized experimental system was used to acquire wrist oscillometric BP data from a narrow (6 cm) <b>cuff</b> and from a wide (10 cm) <b>cuff.</b> Data were acquired from 10 volunteers in sitting position. The results confirmed the objective of the study. All narrow <b>cuff</b> BPs were higher than either the reference BPs or wide <b>cuff</b> BPs. Wide <b>cuff</b> algorithmic BPs were similar to the reference BPs. Wider wrist <b>cuffs</b> appear to be desirable for improved accuracy and reliability of wrist BP monitors...|$|R
40|$|Background: To prevent {{endotracheal tube}} (ETT) -related {{complications}} during mechanical ventilation, ETT <b>cuff</b> pressure {{should be kept}} within proper range. In clinical settings, <b>cuff</b> pressure often decreases from target values. Methods: We performed an experimental study to investigate the effects of measuring devices and endotracheal tubes on change in <b>cuff</b> pressure. We continuously measured <b>cuff</b> pressure by inserting a three-way stopcock {{in the middle of}} an ETT pilot balloon system. After adjusting the <b>cuff</b> pressure to 24 cmH 2 O, we disconnected and reconnected each <b>cuff</b> inflator to the inflation valve of the ETT and measured the changes in the <b>cuff</b> pressure. We measured the change in <b>cuff</b> pressure with different ETT sizes, <b>cuff</b> shapes, brands of <b>cuff</b> inflator, and with and without added extension tubes. Results: The <b>cuff</b> pressure decreased, on average, by 6. 6 cmH 2 O (standard deviation 1. 9), when connecting the <b>cuff</b> inflator to the pilot balloon. The measured <b>cuff</b> pressure was less than 20 cmH 2 O in 67 % of the tests. The <b>cuff</b> pressure decreased more when an extension tube was used. The brand of <b>cuff</b> inflator made no difference to the pressure loss. The <b>cuff</b> pressure decreased more with ETTs of smaller size and with ETTs with pyriform <b>cuffs.</b> Conclusions: Procedures to connect <b>cuff</b> inflators to inflation valves resulted in the loss of <b>cuff</b> pressure by 6. 6 cmH 2 O on average...|$|R
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{tourniquet}} <b>cuff</b> pressures can be substantially reduced without compromising the quality of surgical field by using wide, contoured <b>cuffs.</b> Wide <b>cuffs</b> also {{reduce the risk of}} injury to underlying tissue by dispersing the <b>cuff’s</b> force over a greater surface area. Standard <b>cuffs</b> are relatively narrow in width and are cylindrical in shape. Where there is a significant difference in limb circumference between the distal and proximal edges of the <b>cuff,</b> a contoured <b>cuff</b> with a tapered, conical shape provides a more anatomical fit and maximizes the contact area between <b>cuff</b> and limb. Wide <b>cuffs</b> with an adjustable, variable taper have recently been introduced, permitting one <b>cuff</b> to conform to a variety of limb shapes.|$|R

5|$|Personnel {{experienced}} in direct laryngoscopy {{are not always}} immediately available in certain settings that require emergency tracheal intubation.

Other devices such as rigid stylets, the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic rigid stylets, such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope can also be used as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Each of these devices have its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks, and none of them is effective under all circumstances.|$|E

However, some newer <b>cuffs</b> use releasable application handles as the stabilizer, as shown in bottom figure to the left. Releasable application handles allow more consistent <b>cuff</b> application, faster <b>cuff</b> removal, and maintain the <b>cuff</b> in a stable position on the limb during use.|$|R
40|$|Intra- {{and lateral}} <b>cuff</b> {{pressure}} were measured clinically on endotracheal tubes intubated during nitrous oxide-oxygen anesthesia. Each <b>cuff</b> was inflated with air until the trachea was sealed air-tight. Lateral pressure was directly {{measured with a}} mini-size pressure sensor.

Lateral pressure in latex rubber (LR) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) <b>cuffs</b> increased continuously as time elapsed. LR <b>cuffs</b> exerted the highest tracheal wall pressures, while PVC <b>cuffs</b> exerted intermediate levels of tracheal wall pressures. On the other hand, lateral pressure in silicone rubber (SR) <b>cuffs</b> at first increased and then decreased as time went on. SR <b>cuffs</b> exerted the lowest tracheal wall pressure, but some SR <b>cuffs</b> allowed leakage. A new <b>cuff</b> pressure regulator was originated and evaluated clinically.

Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men. When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being <b>cuffed,</b> and one officer's mustache was made of wax. The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.|$|E

40|$|Background: The authors {{determined}} {{the influence of}} <b>cuff</b> volume and anatomic location on pharyngeal, esophageal, and tracheal mucosal pressures for the esophageal tracheal combitube. Methods: Twenty fresh cadavers were studied. Microchip sensors were attached to the anterior, lateral, and posterior surfaces of the distal and proximal <b>cuffs</b> of the small adult esophageal tracheal combitube. Mucosal pressure for the proximal <b>cuff</b> in the pharynx was measured at 0 - to 100 -ml <b>cuff</b> volume in 10 -ml increments, and for the distal <b>cuff</b> in the esophagus and trachea were measured at 0 - to 20 -ml <b>cuff</b> volume in 2 -ml increments. The proximal <b>cuff</b> volume to form an oropharyngeal seal of 30 cm H₂O was determined. In addition, mucosal pressures for the proximal <b>cuff</b> in the pharynx were measured in four awake volunteers with topical anesthesia. Results: There {{was an increase in}} mucosal pressure in the trachea, esophagus, and pharynx at all <b>cuff</b> locations with increasing volume (all:P < 0. 001). Pharyngeal mucosal pressures were highest posteriorly (50 -ml <b>cuff</b> volume: 99 ± 62 cm H₂O; 100 -ml <b>cuff</b> volume: 255 ± 161 cm H₂O). Esophageal mucosal pressures were highest posteriorly (10 -ml <b>cuff</b> volume: 108 ± 55 cm H₂O; 20 -ml <b>cuff</b> volume: 269 ± 133 cm H₂O). Tracheal mucosal pressures were highest anteriorly (10 -ml <b>cuff</b> volume: 98 ± 53 cm H₂O; 20 -ml <b>cuff</b> volume: 236 ± 139 cm H₂O). The proximal <b>cuff</b> volume to obtain an oropharyngeal seal of 30 cm H₂O was 47 ± 12 ml. Pharyngeal mucosal pressures were similar for cadavers and awake volunteers. Conclusion: We conclude that mucosal pressures for the esophageal tracheal combitube increase with <b>cuff</b> volume, are highest where the <b>cuff</b> is adjacent to rigid anatomic structures, and potentially exceed mucosal perfusion pressure even when <b>cuff</b> volumes are limited to achieving an oropharyngeal seal of 30 cm H₂O...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{aimed at}} {{comparing}} air-sealing {{characteristics of the}} new tapered-shaped tracheal tube <b>cuffs</b> with cylindrical tube <b>cuffs.</b> METHODS: Tracheal tubes with tapered-shaped polyurethane (PU) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) <b>cuffs</b> as well as standard cylindrical-shaped <b>cuffs</b> made of PU and PVC (Covidien, Athlone, Ireland) were investigated. A tracheal model attached to a test lung was intubated, and <b>cuffs</b> were inflated to 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 cm H(2) O. The test lung was ventilated with intermittent positive pressure ventilation at peak inspiratory pressures (PIPs) of 20 and 25 cm H(2) O. Air leakage was assessed by spirometry and measurement of sevoflurane concentration passing the <b>cuff</b> at the upper <b>cuff</b> border using an anaesthetic gas analyser. Experiments were repeated four times with new tracheal tubes for each run. Statistical comparisons were done using Mann-Whitney U-test with level of significance at P < 0. 05. RESULTS: The tapered-shaped PVC tube <b>cuff</b> demonstrated a significantly lower air leakage determined by spirometry than the cylindrical-shaped <b>cuff</b> at both PIPs (20 and 25 cm H(2) O). Similarly, sevoflurane leakage was less with the tapered PVC <b>cuff</b> particularly at higher <b>cuff</b> pressures. With the PU <b>cuff,</b> reduction in air leakage by a tapered-shaped compared with a cylindrical-shaped tube <b>cuff</b> was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: A tapered-shaped tube <b>cuff</b> considerably improves air-sealing characteristics of PVC tube <b>cuffs</b> and allows thereby reducing <b>cuff</b> pressure required for sufficient ventilation. In tube <b>cuffs</b> made of PU that exhibits superior sealing characteristics compared with PVC, a tapered shape failed {{to result in a}} further reduction of air leakage...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of endotracheal tube <b>cuffs</b> made of latex rubber (LR) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or silicone rubber (SR) were investigated {{in a model}} trachea and a vinyl bag filled with nitrous oxide and changes in intra- and lateral <b>cuff</b> pressure in a model trachea were measured. Increases in intracuff and lateral pressures in LR <b>cuffs</b> were more remarkable than those in PVC and SR <b>cuffs.</b> Changes in intracuff pressure, gas volume, component and concentration in air-inflated <b>cuffs</b> were measured in a vinyl bag filled with nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide diffused into all <b>cuffs</b> in a concentration and time-related fashion. The rates of nitrous oxide diffusion in SR <b>cuffs</b> were very great compared with those in LR and PVC <b>cuffs.</b> SR <b>cuffs</b> were also more permeable to oxygen and nitrogen than LR and PVC <b>cuffs.</b> Gas volume in SR <b>cuffs</b> rapidly increased {{within a short time}} and then decreased, though intracuff pressures did not change from the control values. On the other hand, gas volume and intracuff pressure in LR and PVC <b>cuffs</b> increased continuously with time.

40|$|Abstract-A {{new type}} of newe <b>cuff</b> {{electrode}} consisting of conduc-tive segments embedded within a self-curling sheath of biocompatihle insulation has been developed. This spiral nerve <b>cuff</b> is biased to self-wrap around peripheral nerves and possesses a “self-sizing ” property, presenting an alternative to present commercially available, fixed-size nerve <b>cuffs</b> that are manually wrapped around nerves and sutured shut (“split-cylinder ” <b>cuffs).</b> Spiral <b>cuff</b> design and manufacture are de-scribed. We hypothesize that unlike traditional <b>cuffs,</b> the spiral <b>cuff</b> poten-tially can be implanted safely when sized to fit peripheral nerves snugly. Theoretical pressure analyses of traditional and spiral <b>cuffs</b> that sup-port this hypothesis are presented.

25|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} {{is often}} performed for mechanical ventilation of hours to weeks duration. A tube is inserted {{through the nose}} (nasotracheal intubation) or mouth (orotracheal intubation) and advanced into the trachea. In most cases, tubes with inflatable cuffs are used for protection against leakage and aspiration. Intubation with a <b>cuffed</b> tube is thought {{to provide the best}} protection against aspiration. Tracheal tubes inevitably cause pain and coughing. Therefore, unless a patient is unconscious or anaesthetized for other reasons, sedative drugs are usually given to provide tolerance of the tube. Other disadvantages of tracheal intubation include damage to the mucosal lining of the nasopharynx or oropharynx and subglottic stenosis.|$|E
