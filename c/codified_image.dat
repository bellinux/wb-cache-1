40|$|Abstract. Camera {{networks}} are complex vision systems {{difficult to control}} {{if the number of}} sensors is getting higher. With classic approaches, each camera has to be calibrated and synchronized individually. These tasks are often troublesome because of spatial constraints, and mostly due to the amount of information that need to be processed. Cameras generally observe overlapping areas, leading to redundant information that are then acquired, transmitted, stored and then processed. We propose in this paper a method to segment, cluster and <b>codify</b> <b>images</b> acquired by cameras of a network. The images are decomposed sequentially into layers where redundant information are discarded. Without need of any calibration operation, each sensor contributes to build a global representation of the entire network environment. The information sent by the network is then represented by a reduced and compact amount of data using a codification process. This framework allows structures to be retrieved and also the topology of the network. It can also provide the localization and trajectories of mobile objects. Experiments will present practical results {{in the case of a}} network containing 20 cameras observing a common scene. ...|$|R

By contrast, the simplest encoding consists of the image 's raw pixel values.

For Hopkins the world radiated its inner wonder through its external appearances. I'm not so sure about that anymore. In an age of digital simulation, reality is now <b>codified</b> as <b>image,</b> not reflected through its images.

Introduction [...] Literature review [...] A systemic-functional {{semiotic}} {{model for}} reading images [...] Narrative [...] Modality [...] Modem technology & the new visual literacy [...] Composition: Section A. Position & movement [...] Section B. Cohesion [...] Conclusion. The images in children's texts are vessels in which meaning is <b>codified.</b> <b>Images</b> are <b>codified</b> by their creator and decoded by the reader/viewer. This coding {{varies depending on}} {{the format of the}} text, the audience and the relationship between text and its context. Video versions of children's stories, may initially appear similar to their printed counterparts, but their meanings are usually significantly different. The reading/ viewing experience of various realisations is, in fact, essentially different although this may not be immediately apparent to the child reader / viewer. [...] The profiles of ten children's stories are described in order to compare and contrast how the 'personalities' of these picture stories change depending on whether they are realised in comic book form, photonovella, picture story book, film/ television/ video or computer format. These profiles are arrived at via the application of systemicfunctional grammar as developed by Michael Halliday (1985 a) and adapted for the analysis of images by Kress and van Leeuwen (1990). The various media presentations of these stories position the reader / viewer differently and thereby determine how the texts will be read/ viewed even though the titles of these various stories may remain unchanged from their original face-to-face (oral) versions. A comparison of children's picture story texts, a comparison which involves analysing a variety of adaptations, is detailed in this thesis. This comparison is one which describes both the different and the similar ways in which a person reads or views image texts depending on the semiotic system of presentation. [...] Also emphasised in this paper is the importance for educators and those concerned with children's literacy, to bear in mind that picture story books, photonovellas, comics, films, television, videos and books on computers are not translations, transcodings or substitutes for their original versions. They are more appropriately conceived of simply as different texts, thoroughly different realisations of a similar plot and, moreover, differentiated in often unacknowledged ways. The various textual realisations can be seen to require specific visual competencies, specific ways of reading and thinking about how images mean.

False candidates are eliminated with a second cascaded SVM. To further reduce the number of false positives, an ensemble of experts is applied: the final suspect regions are achieved by using a voting strategy. The sensitivity of the presented system is nearly 80 % with a false-positive rate of 1. 1 marks per image, estimated on images coming from the USF DDSM database...|$|R
30|$|Finally, we analyse acquirer’s vision, mission statements, {{philosophy}} and other relevant policies. This step is aimed, first, to integrate <b>codified</b> company’s <b>images</b> {{of the future}} into construction of pathways and, second, to understand, whether a company consistently follows, retains and preserves its own values and philosophy while innovating or prefers to adjust its policies to conform to its current agenda. Bannert and Tschirky stated that an intensified pace of technological change together with growing technological complexity and short product life cycles force companies to shorten their planning horizons to mid-term legislative periods, and source technologies externally (which explains the tactics of sourcing companies rather than raising them inside a company) [37]. However, this position contravenes the practices of numerous high-tech players that consistently develop long-term visions and normative future-oriented policies [61]. Note that peculiarities of the business sector might predetermine acquirer’s vision and philosophy. First, visions usually bear a normative character; technologies, as described in visions are flexible and user-friendly, except those depicted in the “worst-case scenarios” where technique is opposed to and acts hostile towards human beings. Second, an appeal to evolutionary processes in technology helps both build a consistent narrative and avoid logical gaps [62]. Third, {{a wide range of}} marginal sources for new ideas, including science fiction, gaming, movies etc. is facilitated while constructing images of the future(s). Fourth, visions consider technological changes in the broader context, thus describing possible impact of evolving technologies on social, political and economic stability of the system.|$|R
40|$|Staliniana is {{an eclectic}} genre of Russian {{literature}} of the Soviet period. It deals with the fictional image of I. V. Stalin {{and the impact of}} his life and politics on history. For several decades it was the core of socialist realist literature and Stalin's personality cult. The first chapter discusses the phenomena of Stalin's personality cult {{in the context of the}} intellectual history of the post-revolutionary Soviet society in the 1920 s and 1930 s. Chapter two offers different classifications of a vast amount of fiction written on Stalin. The genesis and documented development of staliniana is discussed in the third chapter. Special attention is paid to the manipulations in the genre exercised by ideological and cultural authorities in the USSR from the 1920 s to the 1970 s. The fourth chapter discusses some aspects of staliniana in Western Europe as contrasted to Soviet literature. In the fifth chapter a detailed analysis of key elements of the <b>codified</b> literary <b>image</b> of Stalin is undertaken. Chapter six explores the folklore background of Stalin's cult and its interaction with the cult of V. I. Lenin. The final chapter offers an analysis of the development of the language used by Stalin as a fictional character in works of literature. This study uses the recently declassified materials from Soviet archives in order to demonstrate that staliniana was not only a key element of the Stalin cult but also a cornerstone of Soviet literature...|$|R
