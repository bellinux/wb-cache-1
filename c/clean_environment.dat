5|$|At {{one stop}} on the book tour {{associated}} with the publication and release of the book at the David A. Clarke School of Law of the University of the District of Columbia, Jackson's message was perceived as saying that American history can be studied as an analysis of race, but that economics and the tension between states’ rights and federal rights are the true basis of a domestic history revolving around pursuit of economic development, political power, and personal freedom. He then advanced the theory that these pursuits would most be most readily attained by adopting a set of new constitutional amendments, guaranteeing rights primarily grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the U.S. has ratified. Each is discussed in a separate chapter: the rights to quality health care, housing, education, a <b>clean</b> <b>environment,</b> fair taxes, full employment, equality for women, {{and the right to}} vote.|$|E
5|$|With the {{combined}} efforts of Layton, Luke, Emmy, Loosha, and the Black Ravens, the mecha is eventually defeated and Descole {{is forced to}} retreat. Despite Loosha having been fatally wounded during the fight, she proceeds to destroy the floodgates of the town's dam, drying the lake and revealing {{the entrance to the}} Golden Garden. As the group enter the garden, Loosha dies, and Arianna learns of Loosha's true intentions. Loosha knew that the <b>clean</b> <b>environment</b> of the garden would help Arianna recover from her disease, and fought the specter to ensure the garden would survive long enough to cure her. She fully recovers from her illness a year later, and the Golden Garden's discovery is then made public, marking the beginning of Layton's fame in the field of archaeology.|$|E

25|$|The {{remediation}} {{process in}} Palmerton has been contentious. Both the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the citizens' group Palmerton Citizens for a <b>Clean</b> <b>Environment</b> (PCCE) believe that extensive cleanup of the town's soil {{is necessary to}} protect human health. On the other hand, many citizens, including the Pro-Palmerton Coalition (PPC), argue that the health risks are exaggerated and that the town's Superfund status stigmatizes it. Both groups, {{as well as other}} stakeholders, are part of a Superfund Community Advisory Group called the Palmerton Environmental Task Force.|$|E
25|$|Bernard Kettlewell was {{the first}} to {{investigate}} the evolutionary mechanism behind peppered moth adaptation, between 1953 and 1956. He found that a light-coloured body was an effective camouflage in a <b>clean</b> <b>environment,</b> such as in Dorset, while the dark colour was beneficial in a polluted environment like in Birmingham. This selective survival was due to birds which easily caught dark moths on clean trees, and white moths on trees darkened with soot. The story, supported by Kettlewell's experiment, became the canonical example of Darwinian evolution and evidence for natural selection used in standard textbooks.|$|E
25|$|Sanitation is the {{prevention}} of human contact with feces and the proper treatment and disposal of wastewater. Sanitation also includes promoting hygiene {{on a personal level}} through washing hands with soap. Proper sanitation protects people from hazards that may be microbiological, biological or chemical agents of disease. The main objective of a sanitation system is to protect and promote human health by providing a <b>clean</b> <b>environment</b> that will break the cycle of disease. For example, improving access to safe sanitation and changing hygiene behaviours can reduce the incidents of diarrhea.|$|E

25|$|Environmental {{legislation}} is very strict, and every tourism project must undergo an environmental review and a lengthy process of consultations {{with the public}} and conservationists. Seychelles is a world leader in sustainable tourism. The end result of this sustainable development is an intact and stable natural environment, which attracts financially strong visitors (150,000 in 2007) rather than short-term mass tourism. Since 1993 a law guarantees the citizens {{the right to a}} <b>clean</b> <b>environment</b> {{and at the same time}} obliges them to protect this environment. The country holds a record for the highest percentage of land under natural conservation—nearly 50% of the total land area.|$|E
25|$|In pre-modern times, {{environmental}} issues were not widely discussed, though Ashoka banned {{the burning of}} forests and promoted the planting of trees in his edicts. Bhikkhu Bodhi, an American Theravada monk, has been outspoken {{about the issue of}} environmental crisis. Bodhi holds that the root of the current ecological crisis is the belief that increased production and consumption to satisfy our material and sensual desires leads to well being. The subjugation of nature is directly opposed to the Buddhist view of non-harming and dwelling in nature. Buddhist activists such as Ajahn Pongsak in Thailand and the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement have worked for reforestation and environmental protection. The Dalai Lama also professes the close relationship of human beings and nature, saying that since humans come from nature, {{there is no point in}} going against it. He advocates that a <b>clean</b> <b>environment</b> should be considered a basic human right and that it is our responsibility as humans to ensure that we do all we can to pass on a healthy world to those who come after us.|$|E
500|$|The freedoms {{guaranteed}} by Article 19 are further sought {{to be protected}} by Articles 20–22. The scope of these articles, {{particularly with respect to}} the doctrine of due process, was heavily debated by the Constituent Assembly. It was argued, especially by Benegal Narsing Rau, that the incorporation of such a clause would hamper social legislation and cause procedural difficulties in maintaining order, and therefore it ought to be excluded from the Constitution altogether. The Constituent Assembly in 1948 eventually omitted the phrase [...] "due process" [...] in favour of [...] "procedure established by law". As a result, Article 21, which prevents the encroachment of life or personal liberty by the State except in accordance with the procedure established by law, was, until 1978, construed narrowly as being restricted to executive action. However, in 1978, the Supreme Court in the case of Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India extended the protection of Article 21 to legislative action, holding that any law laying down a procedure must be just, fair and reasonable, and effectively reading due process into Article 21. In the same case, the Supreme Court also ruled that [...] "life" [...] under Article 21 meant more than a mere [...] "animal existence"; it would include the right to live with human dignity and all other aspects which made life [...] "meaningful, complete and worth living". Subsequent judicial interpretation has broadened the scope of Article 21 to include within it a number of rights including those to livelihood, good health, <b>clean</b> <b>environment,</b> water, speedy trial and humanitarian treatment while imprisoned. The right to education at elementary level has been made one of the Fundamental Rights under Article 21A by the 86th Constitutional amendment of 2002.|$|E

40|$|Major {{challenges}} remain when {{attempting to}} quantify and evaluate the impacts of contaminated environments and heterogeneity in the cohorting of health care workers (HCWs) on hospital infections. Data on the detection rate of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB) in a Chinese intensive care unit (ICU) were obtained to accurately evaluate the level of environmental contamination and also to simplify existing models. Data-driven mathematical models, including mean-field and pair approximation models, were proposed to examine the comprehensive effect of integrated measures including cohorting, increasing nurse-patient ratios and improvement of environmental sanitation on MRAB infection. Our results indicate that for <b>clean</b> <b>environments</b> and with strict cohorting, increasing the nurse-patient ratio results in an initial increase and then a decline in MRAB colonization. In contrast, in contaminated environments, increasing the nurse-patient ratio may lead to either a consistent increase or an initial increase followed by a decline of MRAB colonization, depending {{on the level of}} environmental contamination and the cohorting rate. For developing more effective control strategies, the findings suggest that increasing the cohorting rate and nurse-patient ratio are effective interventions for relatively <b>clean</b> <b>environments,</b> while cleaning the environment more frequently and increasing hand washing rate are suitable measures in contaminated environments...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a robust feature {{extraction}} algorithm for automatic classification of pathological and normal voices in noisy environments. The proposed algorithm is based on human auditory processing and the nonlinear Teager-Kaiser energy operator. The robust features which labeled Teager Energy Cepstrum Coefficients (TECCs) are computed in three steps. Firstly, each speech signal frame is passed through a Gammatone or Mel scale triangular filter bank. Then, the absolute value of the Teager energy operator of the short-time spectrum is calculated. Finally, the discrete cosine transform of the log-filtered Teager Energy spectrum is applied. This feature is proposed to identify the pathological voices using a developed neural system of multilayer perceptron (MLP). We evaluate the developed method using mixed voice database composed of recorded voice samples from normophonic or dysphonic speakers. In order to show the robustness of the proposed feature in detection of pathological voices at different White Gaussian noise levels, we compare its performance with results for <b>clean</b> <b>environments.</b> The experimental results show that TECCs computed from Gammatone filter bank are more robust in noisy environments than other extracted features, while their performance is practically similar to <b>clean</b> <b>environments...</b>|$|R
