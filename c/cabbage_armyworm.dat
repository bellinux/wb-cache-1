40|$|AbstractExperiments were {{conducted}} {{to examine the relationship}} between an onset of diapause and dopamine (DA) content in the <b>cabbage</b> <b>armyworm</b> Mamestra brassicae during pupation. The DA levels were significantly higher in haemolymph, integument and brain-central nervous system of diapause-destined pupae than in non-diapause-destined pupae. The elevated level of the integumental DA content was demonstrated to be due to an increase in dopa decarboxylase activity in diapausing pupal integuments through an enhancement of transcript levels of this enzyme. Elevation of the DA level accomplished by feeding l-DOPA to last instar larvae induced a diapause-like state in more than 50 % of the pupae under long daylengths...|$|E
40|$|An {{esterase}} cDNA {{was isolated}} from the <b>cabbage</b> <b>armyworm</b> Mamestra brassicae antennae by PCR strategy. The full-length cDNA, designated as Mbra-EST, contains a 1638 bp open reading frame encoding a predicted protein of 546 amino acids. This predicted protein presents the structural characteristics of known insect carboxyl-esterases, in particular the Ser–His–Glu cata-lytic triad. The expression pattern of the gene was studied by RT–PCR, Northern-blot and in situ hybridization. The ribosomal protein rpL 8 gene from M. brassicae was also cloned to obtain a normalized tool for the comparative gene expression studies. Mbra-EST transcripts are specifically expressed in the antennae {{of males and females}} and in the proboscis of males. In antennae of both sexes, expression is restricted to the olfactory sensilla trichodea, suggesting a role in degradation of odorant acetate compounds, such as pheromones as well as plant volatile acetate components. Key words: antennal esterase, Mamestra brassicae, odorant-degrading enzymes, olfactio...|$|E
40|$|Diapause, a {{programmed}} developmental arrest at {{a specific}} stage, is common in insects and is regulated by hormones. It is well established that in pupal diapause, cessation of ecdysteroid secretion from the prothoracic glands (PGs) after pupal ecdysis leads to diapause initiation, while resumption of its secretion induces post-diapause development. However, what regulates {{the activity of the}} glands is poorly understood, especially for the glands of diapause-terminated pupae. In the present study, we investigate the mechanisms by which post-diapause development is regulated in the <b>cabbage</b> <b>armyworm</b> Mamestra brassicae. We demonstrate that the brain is necessary for the initiation of post-diapause development and that the factor in the brain responsible for the activation of the PGs is the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH). Further, through measuring the hemolymph PTTH titers by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay, we show that PTTH is actually released into the hemolymph prior to the activation of the PGs. Although its peak titer is much lower than expected, this low concentration of PTTH is most likely still effective to activate the PGs of post-diapause pupae, because the responsiveness to PTTH of the glands at this stage is very high compared to that of nondiapause pupal PGs. These results strongly suggest that in M. brassicae, PTTH serves as a trigger to initiate pupa-adult development after diapause termination by stimulating the PGs to secrete ecdysteroid...|$|E
40|$|A new insect {{management}} technology {{known as}} "particle film" technology (Surround) was evaluated for it potential for control early fall pests of head lettuce in Yuma, AZ. Surround did appear to slightly reduce larval population of <b>cabbage</b> looper, beet <b>armyworm</b> and Heliothis, {{but not enough}} to be considered a commercially effective treatment. Additionally, Surround appeared to antagonize Success’s activity towards cabbage loopers. Against whiteflies, Surround did appear to reduce ovipositioning, but resultant impact on the nymph population could not be adequately assessed. Overall, Surround {{does not appear to have}} good fit in the pest management system in leafy vegetables in Yuma, AZ...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{chemical}} compounds have been field evaluated as potential pesticides {{for control of}} insects on lettuce {{over the past several}} years. The important pests of fall planted lettuce being the <b>cabbage</b> looper, beet <b>armyworm</b> and corn earworm. In addition to the chemical compounds, the disease organism Bacillus Thuringiensis was used. It is slower in acting, but can be quite effective, particularly against the cabbage looper. Some of the chemical compounds which have been evaluated and are now available commercially are Sevin, Dibrom and Bidrin. This evaluation will continue as new and possibly more effective materials are made available...|$|R
40|$|Four Monsanto {{transgenic}} {{lines of}} Coker - 312 containing {{the gene for}} endotoxin from Bacillus thuringiensis were compared to Coker- 312 and MD 51 ne for resistance to the pink bollworm (PBW) and leaf-feeding lepidopterans. In 11 samples of 50 bolls per plot, 12 plots per line, collected 7 / 16 to 8 / 24, the transgenic lines averaged 0. 13 PBW / 100 bolls while the controls averaged 5. 92 PBW / 100 bolls. None of the bolls collected from the transgenic lines on 11 / 18 contained diapausing PBW larvae, while the control lines averaged 57 diapausing larvae / 100 bolls. The transgenic lines generally had less leaf damage caused by beet <b>armyworm,</b> <b>cabbage</b> looper and saltmarsh caterpillar...|$|R
40|$|A large block {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} the Yuma Ag Center to compare the field performance of three lettuce management programs for control of lepidopterous larvae. Conventional, experimental and biorational insecticides were sprayed to control beet <b>armyworm,</b> <b>cabbage</b> looper and Heliothis species throughout the growing season. Differences in populations of total larvae among the four treatments, relative to insecticide treatments and timing of application were observed throughout the season. In general, the standard and experimental treatments provided the most consistent control of lepidopterous larvae following each application. Harvest data showed that the spray regimes had a significant influence of head lettuce yield or quality. Maturity and quality were significantly reduced in the untreated control. An economic analysis shows that net returns varied widely among the management programs at different market prices. In conclusion, this study provides preliminary data to support {{the need for more}} development of experimental and biorational insecticide products as alternatives to conventional management programs in desert lettuce production...|$|R
40|$|For a third year, a large block {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} the Yuma Ag Center to compare the field performance of several lettuce IPM programs for control of lepidopterous larvae. Conventional, Reduced -risk, Bio-based and Modified IPM spray regimes were applied to control beet <b>armyworm,</b> <b>cabbage</b> looper and Heliothis species throughout the fall growing season. Differences in populations of total larvae among the treatments, relative to insecticide treatments and timing of application were observed at various times during the season. In general, the Conventional, Reduced -risk and Modified IPM approaches provided the most consistent control of lepidopterous larvae following each application. Harvest data showed that the spray regimes had a significant influence of head lettuce yield or quality. Maturity and quality were significantly reduced in the untreated control. An economic analysis shows that net returns varied widely among the management programs at different market prices. In conclusion, this study provides a strong data base to support {{the need for the}} development of experimental and biorational insecticide products as alternatives to conventional management programs in desert lettuce production. In addition, it demonstrates the dependance of IPM programs on a broad range of plant protection chemicals and control tactics...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} a comparative analysis of defensive and nutritional plant traits responsible for differential herbivory {{in a series}} of experimental feeding trials with generalist herbivores. We measured three defensive traits (leaf strength, leaf mass per unit area and endophytic fungal infection) and two nutritional traits (foliar nitrogen and water) for 26 native and eight non-native plant species from coastal California shrublands. Our feeding trials involved three species of generalist herbivore (beet <b>armyworm,</b> <b>cabbage</b> looper and the garden snail) in two types of laboratory feeding trial (single plant species and preference tests). All traits were significantly related to the amount of leaf area consumed, with foliar nitrogen followed by leaf strength explaining most of the variation in herbivore damage. Defensive and nutritional traits were tightly correlated with one another. These correlations were still apparent after incorporation of the phylogenetic relationships of species using independent contrasts, suggesting that there has been repeated selection for certain trait combinations. Non-native species had lower defensive traits and greater nutrient content and therefore experienced greater herbivory damage than natives. Poorly defended, nutrient-rich species (like most of the non-natives in our study) may be better suited for rapid growth and nutrient acquisition, thus reducing the cost of replenishing leaf material lost to herbivores...|$|R
50|$|This insect is a generalist {{predator}} {{with a broad}} host range, reportedly attacking 90 insect species, {{which includes}} several important economic pests. Reported prey include the larvae of Mexican bean beetle, European corn borer, diamondback moth, corn earworm, beet <b>armyworm,</b> fall <b>armyworm,</b> <b>cabbage</b> looper, imported cabbageworm, Colorado potato beetle, velvetbean caterpillar, and flea beetles. When prey are scarce, the spined soldier bug may feed on plant juices, but this feeding is not reported to cause plant damage. Podisus maculiventris is associated with several crops including alfalfa, apples, asparagus, beans, celery, cotton, crucifers, cucurbits, eggplant, potatoes, onions, soybeans, sweet corn and tomatoes. The effectiveness of this species in preying on economic pests resulted in its use in classical biological control programs in other countries, including Eastern Europe and Russia. However, {{this has not been}} successful in colder climates, perhaps due to an inability of overwinter. Podisus maculiventris eggs are also sold commercially for use in control programs and this has proven successful in controlling pests in European and North American heated greenhouses. Use in large area field crops is often not economically viable due to the production costs of raising the bug. In addition, naturally occurring populations often are not numerous enough to overpower large populations of pests in the spring. Pheromones have been used to draw naturally occurring and newly emerging populations of this stink bug to target crops in the spring.|$|R
40|$|No. 3 {{diflubenzuron}} is {{one type}} of benzoyl N-Phenylurea compound, a type of insect chitin synthesis inhibitor, and has a unique disinsection mechanism. It can depress the chitinous formation on the insect epidermis, and make it die {{in the process of}} ecdysis or metamorphism. It has particularly effective impact on lepidopterous larvae, and it can control many kinds of pests?such as <b>armyworm,</b> <b>cabbage</b> worm, cotton bollworm?Clanis bilineata, Pine caterpillar, Hyphantria cunea? mosquito screwworm etc. No. 3 diflubenzuron hardly has effect on imagoes, and has low virulence on higher animals; the medium lethal dose of white rats is 15, 000 mg/kg on w/w basis. It has high virulence on target insects, but low virulence on non-target insects. This chemical has no specific smell, does not pollute the environment, and is safe for humans and animals. Thus, it is a new diflubenzuron with high-effect and low-virulence, and could replace some organochlorine insecticides such as DDT, Hexachlorocyclohexane and others. Mythimna separata Walker {{is one of the main}} pests of crops in Jilin Province. The infested area per year is usually 5 – 10 million mu [666. 7 m 2] in the whole province; and it will reach above 10 million mu in years of mass-outbreak. It leads to severe reduction of yield or even no yield if the M. separata are not controlled in time. In order to replace the organo-chlorine pesticides with their highly toxic residue?we have been doing experimental investigations and research on the chitin synthesis inhibitors - No. 1 diflubenzuron and No. 2 diflubenzuron - since 1977. In addition, we have done systemic research on No. 3 diflubenzuron supported by leaders in the Science Committee of our province since 1979. Our results are from indoor control experiments of No. 3 diflubenzuron colloidal suspension M. separata, which was synthesized and provided by the Tonghua Chemical Engineering Institute, and field-plot experiments and demonstration extension experiments within Jilin province. In this paper, the partial results of our research are summarized as follows. Originating text in Chinese. Citation: Liang, Shulian, Sun, Yajie, Chen, Ruilu. (1985).
