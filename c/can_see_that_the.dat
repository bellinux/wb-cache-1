5|$|Phase Shifting Interferometry {{addresses}} {{several issues}} associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures {{the positions of the}} fringe centers. As seen in Fig.13, fringe deviations from straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high precision data points. Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig.13, one <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tested surface on the right deviates from flatness, but one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from flatness is concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} colors {{used in the}} film have symbolic meanings. Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights their originality and unlikeness to each other. Color differentiation can be traced {{as far back as}} Nemo's childhood, where three girls sit on a bench. They are his possible future wives: Jeanne, Elise, and Anna; one in yellow, the other in blue, and the third in a red dress. In his life with Elise, Nemo experiences the consequences of depression and despair, themes associated with the color blue. Choosing Jeanne, Nemo seeks material well-being and independence: yellow – the color of life and wealth – emphasizes this. The true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna's dress. It is noteworthy that the unborn Nemo is shown living in a white world. White contains all colors of the visible spectrum; this supports the allegorical message of the film that all things are possible until a choice is made. By the end of his life, Nemo is a decrepit old man and lives in a white surrounding (room, clothes, doctor). This way we <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fate of the protagonist leads him back to the origins from where he started, the point at which everything is possible.|$|E

25|$|In Lankester's {{time the}} Natural History Museum {{had its own}} {{building}} in South Kensington, but in financial and administrative matters it was subordinate to the British Museum. Moreover, the Superintendent (= Director) of the NHM was the subordinate of the Principal Librarian of the BM, a fact which was bound to cause trouble since that august person was not a scientist. We <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> conflict which took place was {{one aspect of the}} struggle undertaken, in their different ways, by Owen, Hooker, Huxley and Tyndall to emancipate science from enslavement by traditional forces.|$|E
25|$|A SPAD {{indicator}} is {{a separate}} indicator which may be positioned after a main signal {{where there is a}} likelihood of a serious collision at a junction if a SPAD (signal passed at danger) occurs at the main signal. SPAD indicators are mounted against a blue backplate or surround. They are normally unlit but following a SPAD they display a steady red light between two flashing red lights arranged vertically. Any driver who sees a SPAD indicator illuminated must stop their train immediately, even if they <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> signal pertaining to their line is showing a proceed aspect.|$|E
25|$|A simple {{computational}} experiment {{illustrates this}} idea. Two instances of a classifier {{were trained to}} distinguish images of planes from those of cars. For training and testing of the first instance, images with arbitrary viewpoints were used. Another instance received only images seen from a particular viewpoint, which was equivalent to training and testing the system on invariant representation of the images. One <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> second classifier performed quite well even after receiving a single example from each category, while performance of the first classifier was close to random guess even after seeing 20 examples.|$|E

25|$|For step 4, it {{has already}} been shown that the ball minus a point admits a {{paradoxical}} decomposition; it remains to be shown that the ball minus a point is equidecomposable with the ball. Consider a circle within the ball, containing the point {{at the center of the}} ball. Using an argument like that used to prove the Claim, one <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> full circle is equidecomposable with the circle minus the point at the ball's center. (Basically, a countable set of points on the circle can be rotated to give itself plus one more point.) Note that this involves the rotation about a point other than the origin, so the Banach–Tarski paradox involves isometries of Euclidean 3-space rather than just SO(3).|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of new foods or preparation methods went through several stages of understanding. Firstly cocoa was {{understood as a}} food and later as a pleasant taste. The latter was only possible through adapting the food to flavours previously known. It is in these first encounters of the Spanish conquistadors with cocoa that we <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> preparation stage was adapted, it was sweetened and flavoured with other spices such as cinnamon and served warm. After {{that they had a}} better understanding of the value of chocolate. Those three simple changes distinguished the chocolate consumed by the Spanish colonisers from the chocolate consumed by the natives. The same pattern occurs in other foods enjoyed at the time by the natives and Spanish. although none of those had an acceptance and a global demand in proportion similar to that of chocolate.|$|E
25|$|In Euclidean geometry, {{a figure}} can be scaled up or scaled down indefinitely, and the {{resulting}} figures are similar, i.e., {{they have the same}} angles and the same internal proportions. In elliptic geometry this is not the case. For example, in the spherical model we <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> distance between any two points must be strictly less than half the circumference of the sphere (because antipodal points are identified). A line segment therefore cannot be scaled up indefinitely. A geometer measuring the geometrical properties of the space he or she inhabits can detect, via measurements, that there is a certain distance scale that is a property of the space. On scales much smaller than this one, the space is approximately flat, geometry is approximately Euclidean, and figures can be scaled up and down while remaining approximately similar.|$|E

Signs are posted all over the hotel front advertising the tour. Guests then enter the lobby, an elaborate and well-decorated room filled with plush furniture and beautiful art. On each ceiling arch is painted a mural of Hightower {{on one of his}} adventures, showing him escaping native people with a valuable artifact or item in his possession. At the end of the lobby is the elevator in its destroyed state, its doors left open with only a single plank of wood holding them together, a broken cable visible inside. Guests are then ushered into a room filled with many pictures of Hightower, his expeditions, and his hotel.|$|E
25|$|It is even {{possible}} to have cases in which an experiment's results differ when the potentials are changed, even if no charged particle is ever exposed to a different field. One such example is the Aharonov–Bohm effect, shown in the figure. In this example, turning on the solenoid only causes a magnetic field B to exist within the solenoid. But the solenoid has been positioned so that the electron cannot possibly pass through its interior. If one believed that the fields were the fundamental quantities, then {{one would expect that}} the results of the experiment would be unchanged. In reality, the results are different, because turning on the solenoid changed the vector potential A in the region that the electrons do pass through. Now that it has been established that it is the potentials V and A that are fundamental, and not the fields E and B, we <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gauge transformations, which change V and A, have real physical significance, rather than being merely mathematical artifacts.|$|E

500|$|P. labiata {{females are}} {{extremely}} aggressive to other females, trying to invade {{and take over}} each other's webs, which often results in cannibalism. A laboratory test showed how they minimise the risk of meeting each other, by recognising pieces with blotting paper containing their own silk draglines and pieces contain other P. labiata females' draglines. If obstacles {{make it impossible to}} see whether the other is physically present, she avoids blotting paper containing the other's draglines, but moves with no constraint if she <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other female is not around. Draglines seem to act as territory marks, much as many mammals identify conspecifics by scent marking. P. labiata females also avoid rival females of higher fighting ability and spend more time around less powerful fighters. A laboratory test collected samples of the draglines [...] of equal-sized females and then pitted some of them in contests. Other females avoided the draglines of the victors, and spent the majority of their time on draglines of the losers. Similar tests showed that females of P. fimbriata from Australia and P. schultzi from Kenya do not avoid draglines of a powerful fighter.|$|E
