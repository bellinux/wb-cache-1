5000|$|Assigned male at birth, Ricki Ortiz {{came out}} as gay in 2003, though she noted later that it [...] "didn't feel right." [...] Ortiz {{experienced}} {{a large amount of}} abuse from anonymous commenters online. In 2009, Ortiz discovered she was a transgender woman, noting that RuPaul's Drag Race helped her realize this. Coming out as transgender sparked a new wave of harassment in livestream <b>chatboxes.</b> By 2012, depression affected Ortiz' fighting game career, though her mental state improved after reconnecting with an old friend and taking advantage of the resources and support groups available to her. In 2014, Ortiz started transition from male to female.|$|R

Rather than passively watching the streamer play, viewers of Twitch Plays Pokémon were able to actively participate by typing commands into the stream's <b>chatbox.</b> While the original Pokémon Red was a single-player role-playing game, {{the use of the}} streamer's code allowed the game to be re-mediated into a CCG. Community-controlled games may exist as either a remediated single-player game or as a game designed to be played by a community.|$|E
