Compared to non-CAD group, <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> level of plasma MPO (p< 0. 01). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that plasma MPO level was correlated with Gensini score. Multiple logistic analysis showed that the odds ratios for CAD across increasing tertiles of MPO level were 1. 191 (0. 971 – 1. 547) and 1. 488 (1. 115 – 2. 228) (p= 0. 048, p= 0. 009 versus 1 st tertile of MPO level, resp.) by adjusting for age, sex, and other conventional risk factors for CAD. The subjects were stratified into nine groups according to tertiles of MPO and HbA 1 c. The odds ratio for CAD was significantly higher in group with highest levels of MPO and HbA 1 c (OR = 4. 08, p< 0. 01). Conclusion. Plasma MPO level was positively correlated with the degree of coronary artery stenosis in type 2 diabetic patients, and increasing blood glucose might amplify the association between MPO and CAD...|$|E

Databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and BIOSIS were systematically searched. The pooled effects were expressed as odds ratio or standardized mean difference or mean difference with 95 % confidence intervals. A total of 14 studies with 57, 916 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled effects showed that the AA group of 1 p 13. 3 rs 599839 had higher total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) levels than the GA/GG group, and the <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> AA genotype frequency than the control group. The TT group of 1 p 13. 3 rs 646776 had higher TC and LDLC levels and lower HDLC levels than the CT/CC group. The CAD group also had higher CC genotype frequency of 1 q 41 rs 17465637 than the control group. The SNPs of 1 p 13 rs 599839 and rs 646776 were associated with serum lipid levels. The genetic variants of 1 p 13 rs 599839 and 1 q 41 rs 17465637 SNPs were prominently related to CAD, and the genetic variants of chromosome 1 p 13 promote the risk of CAD by increased TC and LDLC levels and decreased HDLC levels...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundOxidized low-density {{lipoprotein}} (OxLDL) and remnant lipoprotein {{play a crucial}} role in the development of atherosclerosis. Recently, a novel method for measuring remnant cholesterol levels (remnant lipoproteins cholesterol homogenous assay: RemL-C) has been established. However, the correlation between OxLDL and remnant lipoprotein, including RemL-C, has not been fully investigated. MethodsWe enrolled 25 consecutive patients with documented coronary artery disease (CAD) and 20 controls. Remnant-like particle cholesterol (RLP-C) and RemL-C were used to determine the levels of remnant lipoprotein cholesterol. Serum levels of malondialdehyde-modified LDL (MDA-LDL) and OxLDL using a monoclonal antibody DLH 3 (OxPC) were used to measure the concentration of circulating OxLDL. ResultsThe <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> <b>had</b> <b>high</b> levels of fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c), and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with the control group. Serum levels of total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol were not significantly different between the two groups. The levels of RemL-C (p= 0. 035), MDA-LDL (p= 0. 018), and MDA-LDL/LDL-C (p= 0. 036) in the <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> were significantly higher than those in the control group. The levels of RLP-C tended to be higher in the <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> than those in the control group (p= 0. 096). Positive correlations were demonstrated between remnant lipoprotein cholesterol and OxLDL (RLP-C and MDA-LDL/LDL-C, r= 0. 45, p= 0. 0024, RLP-C and OxPC, r= 0. 51, p= 0. 0005, RemL-C and MDA-LDL/LDL-C, r= 0. 42, p= 0. 0044, RemL-C and OxPC, r= 0. 43, p= 0. 0043). Similar trends were observed in non-diabetic subjects and in subjects without metabolic syndrome. Positive correlations were also observed between RLP-C and RemL-C (r= 0. 94, p< 0. 0001) and between MDA-LDL/LDL-C and OxPC (r= 0. 40, p= 0. 0074). ConclusionsThese results suggest that the association between high levels of remnant lipoprotein cholesterol and high OxLDL levels might be linked to atherogenesis in patients with CAD...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the risk factor profile of coronary artery disease (CAD) in black South Africans. The study was motivated by the increased prevalence of CAD in South Africa, probably as a result of urbanisation. Despite this increase, however, very little is known regarding the cause, risk factor profile and clinical presentations of CAD in the black South African population. Design: A case control study was performed investigating 40 (33 men, 7 women) angiographically defined CAD patients and 20 (13 men and 7 women) age and body composition matched controls. Results: There was no difference in physical activity, sociodemographic factors or dietary intakes between the <b>CAD</b> and control <b>group,</b> except for the CAD patients consuming less vit C (40. 9 vs 61. 3 mg). The <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> <b>had</b> significantly <b>higher</b> LDL-C, fasting glucose and CRP. There was also a significantly higher prevalence of smokers (35 vs 10 %), hypertension (95 vs 75 %) small dense LDL (73 vs 15 %) and insulin resistance (M-value of 4. 15 vs 12. 5 mg/kg/min) in the CAD compared to the control group. In a logistic regression model, small dense LDL and insulin resistance were the main predictors of CAD. Conclusions: Black South African CAD patients had increased levels of the same risk factors that are typically seen in Caucasians with insulin resistance and small dense LDL being particularly significant in their contribution...|$|R

METHODS: The study includes 82 patients with suspected or known CAD referred for coronary angiography. All patients were subjected to full history taking, clinical examination including measurement of arterial blood pressure, body weight, height, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumferences, waist/hip ratio and waist/height ratio. Coronary angiography was performed by standard techniques to determine the presence and severity of coronary artery lesion by Gensini score. RESULTS: Among the 82 patients included in the study, in <b>CAD</b> – <b>group</b> (mean age was 66. 76 ± 9. 12 years) and non-CAD group (mean age was 64. 80 ± 8. 30 years), patients in <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> <b>had</b> BMI (mean 28. 17 ± 3. 32 kg/m 2) and in non-CAD <b>group</b> <b>had</b> BMI (mean 28. 76 ± 4. 68 kg/m 2). Patients in <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> <b>had</b> waist/height ratio (mean 1. 76 ± 7. 56) and in non-CAD <b>group</b> <b>had</b> waist/height ratio (mean 0. 57 ± 0. 08). Patient in <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> <b>had</b> waist/hip ratio (mean 0. 93 ± 0. 06) and in non-CAD group (mean 0. 88 ± 0. 07). Thirty seven patients (45. 1 %) had no coronary artery disease (Gensini score = 0), 15 patients (18. 3 %) had mild disease (Gensini score = 1 - 32), 14 patients (17. 1 %) had moderate disease (Gensini score = 32 - 58), 16 patients (19. 5 %) had severe disease (Gensini score ≥ 58).

40|$|OBJECTIVE — In {{patients}} with uncomplicated diabetes, there is low probability of finding significant {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) by noninvasive tests. Therefore, screening for its presence is not justified, {{and it is important}} to find reliable predictors of silent CAD to identify {{patients with}} uncomplicated diabetes for further screening. The relationship between lipopro-tein(a) [Lp(a) ], apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a) ] polymorphism, and silent CAD has never been stud-ied. We investigated the association of Lp(a) and apo(a) polymorphism with angiographically documented asymptomatic CAD in type 2 diabetic patients without evident complications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — A total of 1, 323 diabetic patients without any clinical and electrocardiographic evidence of CAD were evaluated. Of 121 patients with highly positive results of exercise electrocardiography (ECG) (n 30) or positive results on exercise thallium scintigraphy (n 91), 103 subjects showed angiographically documented CAD (CAD group). Of 1, 106 patients with negative results on exercise ECG, 103 subjects without CAD (NO CAD group) were selected and matched by age, gender, and duration of diabetes to patients in the CAD group. In patients in the NO CAD group, results of exercise ECG, 48 -h ambulatory ECG, and stress echocardiography were negative for CAD. RESULTS — The <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> Lp(a) levels (21. 7 17. 7 vs. 15. 2 19. 0 mg/dl; P 0. 0093) than the NO CAD group, and a percentage of subjects had at least one small apo(a) isoform (68. 9 vs. 29. 1 %; P 0. 0000) higher than the NO CAD group. Logistic regression analysis showed that apo(a) phenotypes (odds ratio [OR] 8. 13, 95 % CI 3. 65 – 21. 23), microalbu-minuria (5. 38, 2. 44 – 11. 88), smoking (2. 72, 1. 31 – 5. 64), and Lp(a) levels (2. 41, 1. 15 – 5. 03) were predictors of asymptomatic CAD. CONCLUSIONS — Our investigation reports the first evidence of an independent associa-tion of Lp(a) and apo(a) polymorphism with asymptomatic CAD. This suggests that Lp(a) levels and apo(a) phenotypes could be used together with other risk factors as markers of asymptom-atic CAD in patients with diabetes...|$|E

40|$|Background: Metabolic {{syndrome}} (MS) is {{a cluster}} of abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidaemia, hypertension and insulin resistance with or without hyperglycaemia associated with increased risk of coronary heart diseases. There may be a possible link between MS, central obesity and increased markers of oxidative stress. The oxidative stress in central obesity and MS with different glycaemic status is still unclear. Objective: The aim of our study was to evaluate the oxidative stress in central obesity and MS subjects with different glycaemic status and subjects with central obesity without MS. Design: A total of 260 subjects (Mean±SD : 53 ± 11, 66 Males) were randomly recruited and divided into 5 groups: central obesity without MS (OBXMS), MS with diabetes (MSDM), MS with impaired fasting glucose (MSIFG), MS with normoglycaemia (MSNG) and normal control (NC). In addition, MSDM, MSIFG and MSNG were grouped as all MS group with a total number of 156. The blood levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and 8 -Isoprostane were evaluated. Results: OBXMS group was not significantly different compared to NC group. MSDM group compared to NC <b>group</b> <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> 8 -Isoprostane (p< 0. 001). MSIFG group compared to NC <b>group</b> <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> oxLDL (p< 0. 001) and 8 -Isoprostane (p< 0. 001). MSNG group compared to NC <b>group</b> <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> 8 -Isoprostane (p< 0. 001).

While calcium halted hip bone turnover, it only did so for one year after treatment. Supplementation with vitamin D continued the reduction in hip bone turnover for three to five years. Context: Effects of long-term calcium, with or without vitamin D, on hip bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover in sunny climates have not been reported. Objective: The aim was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D added to calcium supplementation on hip dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry BMD and calcium-related analytes. Design, Setting, and Participants: The study was a 5 -yr randomized, controlled, double-blind trial of 120 community-dwelling women aged 70 – 80 yr. Interventions: The interventions were 1200 mg/d calcium with placebo vitamin D (Ca group) or with 1000 IU/d vitamin D 2 (<b>CaD</b> <b>group),</b> or double placebo (control). Main Outcome Measures: Hip BMD, plasma 25 -hydroxyvitamin D, biomarkers of bone turnover, PTH, and intestinal calcium absorption were measured. Results: Hip BMD was preserved in CaD (− 0. 17 %) and Ca (0. 19 %) groups but not controls (− 1. 27 %) at yr 1 and maintained in the <b>CaD</b> <b>group</b> only at yr 3 and 5. The beneficial effects were mainly in those with baseline 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels below the median (68 nmol/liter).

Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is typically triggered by an acute emotional or physical stress events. Aim {{of this study}} was to investigate the impact of emotional stressors on clinical features, laboratory parameters, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings in patients with TTC. Methods. Of 103 patients enrolled from the TTC registry database, fifteen patients had emotional triggers (E group), and 88 patients had physical triggers or no triggers (other group). Results. Most clinical presentations and in-hospital courses were similar between the groups. However, E <b>group</b> <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> prevalence of chest pain (87 versus 42 %, P = 0. 001), palpitation (27 versus 6 %, P = 0. 008), whereas other <b>group</b> <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> prevalence of cardiogenic shock (35 versus 7 %, P = 0. 027). E <b>group</b> <b>had</b> significantly <b>higher</b> corrected QT intervals (median, 477. 5 versus 438 ms, P = 0. 001), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (mean, 45. 7 versus 39. 6 %, P = 0. 001), but lower hs-CRP (median, 0. 1 versus 3. 3 mg/L...|$|R
40|$|As {{the smart}} phone market grows rapidly, the {{significance}} of the application (app) market also increases. The purposes of this study were to identify market segments according to technological innovativeness and clothing involvement, and to compare the differences in lifestyles, benefits of fashion information app sought, and intention to use. The data were collected from smart phone users in their 10 s to 30 s in 2013, and a total of 292 data sets were analyzed. The findings of this study were as follows. The respondents were divided into three groups, innovative group, clothing involvement group, and passive group. Significant differences were found among three segments in terms of age, marital status, education level, and monthly income. With respect to five lifestyle factors, innovative group and clothing involvement <b>group</b> <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> mean scores for rational purchase, personal relationship, and personality pursuit than passive group. However, these two groups showed differences in brand pursuit factor. The benefits of the fashion information app were generated into two factors, information benefit and enjoyment benefit. Innovative group and clothing involvement <b>group</b> <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> values than passive group in these two factors. Finally, innovative <b>group</b> <b>had</b> the <b>highest</b> value on the intentio...|$|R
40|$|Background: Circulatory power (CP) and {{ventilatory}} power (VP) are indices {{that have}} been used for the clinical evaluation of patients with heart failure; however, no study has evaluated these indices in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) without heart failure. Objective: To characterize both indices in patients with CAD compared with healthy controls. Methods: Eighty-seven men [CAD group = 42 subjects and healthy control group (CG) = 45 subjects] aged 40 – 65 years were included. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed on a treadmill and the following parameters were measured: 1) peak oxygen consumption (VO 2), 2) peak heart rate (HR), 3) peak blood pressure (BP), 4) peak rate-pressure product (peak systolic HR x peak BP), 5) peak oxygen pulse (peak VO 2 /peak HR), 6) oxygen uptake efficiency (OUES), 7) carbon dioxide production efficiency (minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production slope), 8) CP (peak VO 2 x peak systolic BP) and 9) VP (peak systolic BP/carbon dioxide production efficiency). Results: The <b>CAD</b> <b>group</b> <b>had</b> significantly lower values for peak VO 2 (p < 0. 001), peak HR (p < 0. 001), peak systolic BP (p < 0. 001), peak rate-pressure product (p < 0. 001), peak oxygen pulse (p = 0. 008), OUES (p < 0. 001), CP (p < 0. 001), and VP (p < 0. 001...|$|R
