A small area in {{the southern tip of}} the nation, surrounding Gaya can expect to receive 700mm to 900mm or rainfall. Northern areas which support crops, such as the southern portions of the Aïr Massif and the Kaouar oasis rely upon oases and a slight increase in rainfall due to mountain effects. Large portions of the northwest and far east of the nation, while within the Sahara desert, see just enough seasonal rainfall to support semi-nomadic animal husbandry. The populations of these areas, mostly Tuareg, Wodaabe - Fula, and Toubou, practise Transhumance: traveling south to pasture and sell animals in the dry season, north into the Sahara in the brief rainy season, while maintaining settled communities along these routes.|$|E

Two thousand years ago, Cicero stated that tending fields is among the noblest occupations for grown men, but our contemporary lifestyle seems to have forgotten that lesson. For a very long time, agriculture has been considered a relic of ancient times, and not to be pursued by techno-friendly citizens. However, we are experiencing a renaissance of attention and importance, as urban gardening and other innovative forms of agriculture and horticulture are spreading throughout our hyper-technological postmetropolises. These forms of <b>crop</b> <b>tending</b> are also stimulating new forms of relationships, spurring people to regain some control over their lives and spend some time closer to Nature. We do not have to idolize or romanticize what is happening today, but these phenomena share some common ground with the environmental awareness that is (arguably) slowly affecting our perception of the world, as even movies and fiction seem to point out. Therefore, <b>crop</b> <b>tending</b> is now probably becoming a form of society tending, or socioculture...|$|E
