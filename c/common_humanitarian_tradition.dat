40|$|Abstract: The chapter explores continuities {{in modern}} British humanitarianism at its birth {{two hundred years}} ago and today. Modern British humanitarianism arose out of the contradictions between humanist ideals, {{expanding}} social sympathies, and fears of radical political change following the French Revolution. Its development was strongly influenced by middle class evangelical reform circles, exemplified by the abolitionist William Wilberforce. The chapter argues that British humanitarianism today follows Wilberforce’s conservative <b>humanitarian</b> <b>tradition</b> and his anti-progressive views.

Discourse analytical techniques are used to analyse a corpus of official documents that have contributed to the reframing of the status of refugees. The thesis provides an overview of the development of refugee policy in Canada and explores the world context for contemporary refugee flows. It draws on the securitization paradigm to track the discursive processes that have served to establish links between terrorism, national security and refugees in Canadian governmental discourses and its related practices. The thesis also draws attention to Canada's national and international commitments to protect human rights, and the challenges Canada has faced in maintaining a balance between its <b>humanitarian</b> <b>tradition</b> and its new pre-emptive security approach. It is argued that the new War on Terror, has, as a consequence, targeted innocent and vulnerable populations such as refugees, in this way eroding their rights...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} ten years, Switzerland has {{undergone}} a very public process of critical reassessment of its involvement in the Second World War. Until 1996, Switzerland enjoyed a reputation abroad as a neutral country with a strong <b>humanitarian</b> <b>tradition,</b> ‘a democratic State, standing for freedom in self-defence among her mountains’, as Churchill once described it. However, this heroic image of Switzerland was destabilized in the mid 1990 s by allegations from abroad that Swiss banks and financial institutions had aided the Nazis in economic affairs during the war. In December 1996, the Unabhängige Experten-kommission, headed by the eminent Swiss historian Jean-François Bergier, was appointed to undertake a thorough examination of Switzerland’s role in European affairs during the Second World War. The publication of the Bergier Commission’s Final Report in March 2002 finally brought into the public domain what Swiss intellectuals and historians had asserted for years, namely that {{for the duration of}} the war, Switzerland accommodated and supported the perpetrators in important, mostly financial ways. The report, which had taken eleven historians more than five years to complete, represents a landmark in terms of both Swiss historiography of the Second World War and public engagement with the recent past...|$|R

40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 10 JUN 2014 When Australia pledged to accept 15, 000 Jewish refugees from Europe in 1938, it was applauded by the London Times as “a characteristically generous contribution” and {{an example for}} others. Australia's reputation for generous humanitarianism was solidified after the war when it absorbed more than 180, 000 of Europe's Displaced Persons and committed to international human rights instruments designed to protect refugees and asylum seekers. This reputation {{has been used to}} both defend and critique the nation's contemporary responses to asylum seekers. Recent Australian Prime Ministers have invoked Australia's proud record of refugee resettlement to deflect criticism of their tough border control policies, policies which critics charge repudiate the nation's <b>humanitarian</b> <b>traditions.</b> This article critically reviews the history of Australia's responses to refugees and asylum seekers prior to 1951 and demonstrates that contemporary border control policies are neither a deviation from, nor defence of, a proud humanitarian record. Rather, they embody the migration management approach to refugees that provided impetus for Federation in 1901, governed Australia's response to the Jewish refugee crisis in the 1930 s, and shaped its conditional acceptance of the Displaced Persons and the position it adopted in the drafting of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees in 1951.

40|$|There has {{recently}} been a call for more pedagogic comparative research to counter the dominance of structural and policy led studies.

The research, on which this paper is based, fulfils both these aims by investigating creative teaching and learning in nine European countries at classroom level using ethnographic methods in a small number of sites for each partner. The research partners share a common discourse of pedagogy that we are calling creative teaching and learning, a <b>common</b> <b>humanitarian</b> discourse and the ethnographic methodology for the research was a strong framework to counter differing cultural approaches to research. The article analytically characterises some significant strategies used by teachers, the creative learning experienced and the meaning that the experiences had for the students involved.

5000|$|To {{emphasize}} the importance of a <b>common</b> <b>humanitarian</b> position on the outflow of Zimbabweans into the region the Regional Office for Southern Africa of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs coined the term [...] "migrants of humanitarian concern" [...] in 2008. Most of those crossing the border did not apply for refugee status, but they could also hardly be considered as [...] "voluntary" [...] economic migrants. Many of them were not legally protected, nor do they receive humanitarian support. In Botswana, Zambia and Malawi, asylum is available to Zimbabweans; in Mozambique, the few applicants for asylum had been rejected due to the state's decision to consider Zimbabweans as 'economic' and not as forced humanitarian migrants. Except for South Africa, protection and access to services in most countries in the region is contingent on receiving the refugee status, and require asylum seekers to stay in isolated camps, unable to work or travel, and thus send money to relatives that stayed behind in Zimbabwe.

40|$|There are two {{distinct}} orientations within the American social welfare system. The first orientation is a bureaucratic {{one in which}} heteronomous agencies are committed {{to a set of}} externally imposed regulations designed to provide relief to individuals who require some form of assistance in order to survive (Blau, 1965; Friedlander, 1968 : 258 - 284; Wilensky and Lebeaux, 1965 : 233 - 282). Assistance usually takes the form of monetary grants. The second orientation is professional in character (Meyer, 1959). In many agencies, priority is given to the provision of the rehabilitative services to which professionally trained social workers are committed in principle and to which nonprofessionals, after years of dedication to the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>tradition,</b> may also be committed (Thomas, 1959; Wilensky and Lebeaux, 1965 : 283 - 334). Most directors of public assistance agencies agree that too much emphasis is given to financial assistance and not enough to family counselling, child welfare, mental health and addiction programs. Since there are limited resources available to each agency, agencies that give priority to rehabilitative services must be organized to maximize the amount of time and personnel allocated to these services and minimize the amount of time and personnel allocated to providing financial assistance. Based on a questionnaire administered to a stratified national sample of directors of county public assistance agencies, this paper reports the results of research designed to study the distribution of agency activities implementing either relief or rehabilitation goals. The purpose of the paper is to analyze the effects of bureaucratization and professionalization on the distribution of these activities and on the evaluation of agency effectiveness in helping to meet clients 2 ̆ 7 needs. Since the questionnaire was designed and administered prior to the current development of the separation of rehabilitative services and relief activities into differentiated administrative systems, the findings reported in this study are specific to problems associated with the delivery of unseparated social services. Once the development of separated social services is complete, {{it should be possible to}} compare the effects of differentiated and undifferentiated administrative systems on the delivery of social services to the economically deprived...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} not {{presented}} in a conventional panel. The two papers on this panel were presented {{in the form of}} brief notes towards a two dialogue—between the presenters and between presenters and audience. In spite of the imperialist spectre that continues to haunt the environment of cosmopolitanism, the desire to locate a “genuine” strand of human interconnection beyond neo-liberal defenses of globalization and official multiculturalism persists. In this paper, I explore whether humanitarianism can be seen as one such strand of cosmopolitanism. To what extent does humanitarianism provide an “edge” that marks the transcendence of the divisions of borders, cultures, and conceptions of difference? To what extent does humanitarianism provide a model for inclusivity and the respect for diversity that cosmopolitanism, as well as this year’s Congress, seeks to promote? Since the end of the Cold War, the number and diversity of humanitarian organizations have proliferated {{at the same time that}} the humanitarian ideal has come into question. Joseph Slaughter traces the origins of humanitarianism to Henri Dunant’s narrative of his experience of the Battle of Solferino in Un Souvenir de Solferino (1862). Dunant is widely seen to have been the inspiration for both the International Committee for the Red Cross and the first Geneva Conventions. I seek to examine contemporary narratives of humanitarianism in relation to the ideal of “indifference” (to the religion, citizenship, race of the sufferer) that Slaughter argues Un Souvenir de Solferino represents; the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>tradition</b> posits neutrality, impartiality and universal humanity as its ideals. These narratives include the following: Romeo Dallaire’s They Fight Like Soldiers, They Die Like Children (2010); James Orbinski’s An Imperfect Offering (2008); Samantha Nutt’s Damned Nations (2012); and Scott Morgenson’s Three Cups of Tea (2007). This paper is part of a panel that will be organized in a way to garner extensive audience involvement and to model critical dialogue. Each presenter will put forward a specific argument in relation to the focus questions for the panel in 10 - 15 minutes each. Following these brief position papers, they will engage in a discussion of approximately 15 - 20 minutes in which they critically engage with one another’s arguments.

This is based on the top down approach which is mostly <b>common</b> in <b>humanitarian</b> aid, where practitioners perceive this to be the right mode of aid delivery to affected communities. This research has used mixed methods of research designs. Participants were purposively and randomly sampled and 193 household heads, 2 focus group discussions and 10 key informants were interviewed.

40|$|Purpose This paper {{explores the}} {{challenges}} {{inherent in the}} development of a <b>common,</b> inter-agency, <b>humanitarian</b> logistic picture (CHLP) that would, ultimately, provide the mechanism in which the real-time disposition and status of assets, material in transit and forecast demands and re-supply are captured, analysed and presented as the basis for improved coordination and subsequent decision making. Design/methodology/approach This conceptual paper integrates knowledge management and humanitarian/military logistics literature to offer a research agenda that would help deliver a CHLP. Findings The paper identifies a series of the key challenges that will need to be overcome as part of the development of the concept of CHLP, and it offers some preliminary suggestions for the approaches that might be adopted in order to overcome these. Research limitations/implications Given that the paper has been developed from a theoretical standpoint, the key element of the next stage of the research process is that of corroborating these initial findings with key informants from practitioner organisations drawn from countries across the globe. Practical implications Whilst significant progress has been made in developing the practice of humanitarian logistics, further improvements in both the efficiency and effectiveness have the potential to save lives and reduce suffering. This paper offers a practical way of tackling the key challenge of inter-agency coordination and decision making.
