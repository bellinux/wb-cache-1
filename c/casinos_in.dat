5|$|Following {{the first}} event, Packer wanted {{to expand the}} race to take in more states. The 1990 race started on May 4 in Wilmington in Delaware, a state which Trump {{considered}} important for his three <b>casinos</b> <b>in</b> Atlantic City, and also visited Baltimore, after Trump agreed to local racecourse owner Joe De Francis's condition that he moor his yacht the Trump Princess in Baltimore Harbor during the race. It finished in Boston on May 13. Entrants in 1990 included 1989 winner Dag Otto Lauritzen, Greg LeMond, who was coming back from a virus and food poisoning, Steve Bauer, who had finished second in Paris-Roubaix that year, Andrew Hampsten, Davis Phinney, Ekimov, {{in his first year}} as a professional, and East German rider Olaf Ludwig. The race was won by Mexican rider Raúl Alcalá of the PDM-Concorde team.|$|E
5|$|The economy {{continued}} in muted form. The three main establishment families on the island, the Moodys, the Sealys, and Kempners, had essentially unrivalled {{control of the}} island. The Splash Day celebrations restarted, drawing tourists to the coast. Many hotels, banks, and some insurance companies remained as did the medical and nursing schools, {{as well as the}} hospitals. Efforts at historical preservation (notably including those of George P. Mitchell) gradually helped to re-establish the island's tourism industry, though in a very different form from the past. Nonbinding referenda were put forward in the 1980s regarding legalization of <b>casinos</b> <b>in</b> the city but were defeated by the voters each time, demonstrating the changes in the city since the bygone era. However informal polls in 2008 and 2010 indicate this sentiment may be changing. Indeed gambling aboard cruise ships leaving from Galveston is now commonplace.|$|E

5|$|September 27, 1985– Hurricane Gloria {{parallels}} the New Jersey coastline just offshore as a Category2 hurricane. Its arrival forces 95,000citizens to evacuate, while eleven <b>casinos</b> <b>in</b> Atlantic City are closed, {{resulting in a}} loss of $7million (1985USD). Dubbed by some as the storm of the century, the hurricane is expected to become the first hurricane to hit the New Jersey coastline since the hurricane in 1903, though a last minute turn spares the state. While passing by the state, Gloria caused a storm surge of 4.6feet (1.4m) in Ventnor City and a wind gust of 80mph (129km) in Ocean City. Despite coming within miles of the coast, the storm caused only light rainfall along the shoreline, though further inland there were reports of over 5inches (13cm). Strong winds down trees and power lines, leaving 237,000 without power after the storm. Overall, damage is minor, and some were even disappointed at the lack of damage from the proclaimed storm of the century.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, a spur of Route 4, Route S4A, was {{proposed}} as a route running from Route 4 (now U.S. Route 9) in Tuckerton in Ocean County south to Little Beach. In 1929, this route was to continue south through Brigantine to Atlantic City, with the portion south of Little Beach {{to be built}} by Atlantic County. The state of New Jersey took over the proposed extension of Route S4A from Little Beach to Atlantic City in 1938. However, the portion of this route between Brigantine and the Atlantic/Ocean County line was never built, and the portion of road that existed in Ocean County {{was removed from the}} state highway system by 1941. In 1945, another route called Route S56, a spur of Route 56 (now U.S. Route 30), {{was proposed}} to run north along Brigantine Boulevard (present-day Route 187 and Route 87) from Atlantic City to Brigantine. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 87 was designated as an unsigned route along the former alignment of Route S4A and the proposed Route S56 between U.S. Route 30 in Atlantic City and Brigantine. Following the 1953 renumbering, the southern portion of Route 87 in Atlantic City split into two alignments, with one following Huron Avenue and the other following Brigantine Boulevard. Eventually, the alignment of Route 87 along Brigantine Boulevard between U.S. Route 30 and Huron Avenue became Route 187. In 2001, the Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector was completed, linking Route 87, the <b>casinos</b> <b>in</b> the Marina District, and Brigantine with the Atlantic City Expressway.|$|E
