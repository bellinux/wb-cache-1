25|$|In {{optimization}} problems, heuristic algorithms {{can be used}} to find {{a solution}} close to the optimal solution in cases where finding the optimal solution is impractical.

Some of them, like simulated annealing, are non-deterministic algorithms while others, like tabu search, are deterministic. When a bound on the error of the non-optimal solution is known, the algorithm is further categorized as an approximation algorithm.|$|E

25|$|Subsequently, Book I of Euclid's Elements {{dealt with}} {{equality}} of areas between two-dimensional figures. The mathematician Archimedes used {{the tools of}} Euclidean geometry {{to show that the}} area inside a circle is equal to that of a right triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius, in his book Measurement of a Circle. (The circumference is 2r, and the area of a triangle is half the base times the height, yielding the area r2 for the disk.) Archimedes approximated the value of π (and hence the area of a unit-radius circle) with his doubling method, in which he inscribed a regular triangle in a circle and noted its area, then doubled the number of sides to give a regular hexagon, then repeatedly doubled the number of sides as the polygon's area got <b>closer</b> <b>and</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> that of the circle (and did the same with circumscribed polygons).|$|E
25|$|Moths {{frequently}} {{appear to}} circle artificial lights, although {{the reason for}} this behavior remains unknown. One hypothesis to explain this behavior is that moths use a technique of celestial navigation called transverse orientation. By maintaining a constant angular relationship to a bright celestial light, such as the moon, they can fly in a straight line. Celestial objects are so far away that, even after travelling great distances, the change in angle between the moth and the light source is negligible; further, the moon will always be in {{the upper part of the}} visual field, or on the horizon. When a moth encounters a much closer artificial light and uses it for navigation, the angle changes noticeably after only a short distance, in addition to being often below the horizon. The moth instinctively attempts to correct by turning toward the light, thereby causing airborne moths to come plummeting downward, and resulting in a spiral flight path that gets <b>closer</b> <b>and</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the light source.|$|E
25|$|Node lookups {{can proceed}} asynchronously. The {{quantity}} of simultaneous lookups is denoted by α and is typically three. A node initiates a FIND_NODE request by querying to the α nodes {{in its own}} k-buckets that are the closest ones to the desired key. When these recipient nodes receive the request, they will look in their k-buckets and return the k closest nodes to the desired key that they know. The requester will update a results list with the results (node ID's) he receives, keeping the k best ones (the k nodes that are closer to the searched key) that respond to queries. Then the requester will select these k best results and issue the request to them, and iterate this process again and again. Because every node has a better knowledge of his own surroundings than any other node has, the received results will be other nodes that are every time <b>closer</b> <b>and</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the searched key. The iterations continue until no nodes are returned that are closer than the best previous results. When the iterations stop, the best k nodes in the results list are {{the ones in the}} whole network that are the closest to the desired key.|$|E

25|$|Colony-level {{inhibitory}} {{strategies can}} also create 'organizational immunity'. For example, social insect workers tend to work initially at {{the centre of}} the nest, nursing the brood, and as they age adopt tasks <b>closer</b> <b>and</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the periphery, e.g., foraging. This compartmentalization, termed centrifugal polyethism, means that workers of the same age interact mainly with others of the same age, who are performing the same task in the same spatial compartment: thus if a new disease arises that is transmitted through physical worker-worker contact it is limited to one section of the colony. The spatial structuring of western honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera) privileges young individuals-when colonies are afflicted with diseases that have a short infectious period (the time period during which infected individuals can transmit the disease to susceptible individuals), it is confined only to the older individuals closer to the outside. In the common eastern bumblebee (Bombus impatiens), workers who feed larvae tend to remain near {{the centre of the}} nest even when not performing this activity, and the converse is true for workers who forage; 11–13% of workers remain in small zones a particular distance from the nest centre throughout their life. The demographic distribution of a colony can also can be utilized for antiparasite purposes: work on Z. angusticollis has shown that not only are there differences to parasite susceptibility between instars but that the demographic constitution of a group significantly affects survivorship (mixed age groups do better than single-age groups). The effect of colony structuring on disease dynamics and social immunity is also analyzed theoretically using mathematical models.|$|E
25|$|Together {{with the}} Waldensians and the Lollards (led by John Wycliffe), the Bohemian Reformation is {{considered}} to be the precursor to the Protestant Reformation. These movements are sometimes referred to as the First Reformation in the Czech historiography. Despite the influence of the German and Swiss Reformations, the Bohemian Reformation did not bleed into them, although many Czech Utraquists grew <b>closer</b> <b>and</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the Lutherans. The Bohemian Reformation kept its own development until the suppression of the Bohemian Revolt in 1620. The victorious restored King Ferdinand II decided to force every inhabitant of Bohemia and Moravia to become Roman Catholic in accordance with the principle cuius regio, eius religio of the Peace of Augsburg (1555). The Bohemian Reformation ended up being diffused in the Protestant world and gradually lost its distinctiveness. The Patent of Toleration issued in 1781 by Emperor Joseph II did not lead to a restoration of the Bohemian Reformation. Joseph II did not respect the Bohemian religious tradition and therefore only Lutheran, Calvinist and Eastern Orthodox faiths were made legal in the Crown of Bohemia and other parts of his realm. In spite of the extinction of the Bohemian Reformation as a distinctive Christian movement, its tradition did not disappear. Many churches (not only in the Czech Republic) do not forget their legacy, refer to the Bohemian Reformation and try to continue its tradition, e. g. the Moravian Church (the continuator of the scattered Unity of the Brethren), Protestant Church of Czech Brethren (Českobratrská církev evangelická), Czechoslovak Hussite Church (Československá církev husitská), Church of Brethren (Církev bratrská), Unity of Brethren Baptists (Bratrská jednota baptistů) and other denominations.|$|E
