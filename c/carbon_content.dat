5|$|As {{the rate}} of cooling is {{increased}} the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the <b>carbon</b> <b>content,</b> the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from austenite to martensite. Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E

If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target.

5|$|Iron metal {{has been}} used since ancient times, {{although}} copper alloys, which have lower melting temperatures, were used even earlier in human history. Pure iron is relatively soft, but is unobtainable by smelting because it is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities, in particular carbon, from the smelting process. A certain proportion of carbon (between 0.002% and 2.1%) produces steel, which may be up to 1000times harder than pure iron. Crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron, which has a high <b>carbon</b> <b>content.</b> Further refinement with oxygen reduces the <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> to the correct proportion to make steel. Steels and iron alloys formed with other metals (alloy steels) {{are by far the}} most common industrial metals because they have a great range of desirable properties and iron-bearing rock is abundant.|$|E

5|$|Steel (with smaller <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> than {{pig iron}} {{but more than}} wrought iron) was first {{produced}} in antiquity by using a bloomery. Blacksmiths in Luristan in western Persia were making good steel by 1000BC. Then improved versions, Wootz steel by India and Damascus steel were developed around 300BC and AD500 respectively. These methods were specialized, and so steel did not become a major commodity until the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|The <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> {{of steel}} is between 0.002% and 2.14% by weight for plain ironcarbon alloys. These values vary {{depending}} on alloying elements such as manganese, chromium, nickel, iron, tungsten, carbon and so on. Basically, steel is an iron-carbon alloy that does not undergo eutectic reaction. In contrast, cast iron does undergo eutectic reaction. Too little <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> leaves (pure) iron quite soft, ductile, and weak. Carbon contents {{higher than those of}} steel make an alloy, commonly called pig iron, that is brittle (not malleable). While iron alloyed with carbon is called carbon steel, alloy steel is steel to which other alloying elements have been intentionally added to modify the characteristics of steel. Common alloying elements include: manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, boron, titanium, vanadium, tungsten, cobalt, and niobium. Additional elements are also important in steel: phosphorus, sulfur, silicon, and traces of oxygen, nitrogen, and copper, that are most frequently considered undesirable.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanical}} properties {{of iron and}} its alloys can be evaluated {{using a variety of}} tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and the Vickers hardness test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests. However, the {{mechanical properties}} of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium, and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20–30Brinell.

In this study, Co-Cr-Mo alloy with carbon concentrations of 0. 03 % and 0. 24 % were oxidized at 1050 °C for 3 hours under atmospheric condition. The oxidized substrates were characterized under FESEM and subjected to circulating immersion test in simulated body fluid (SBF) for 21 days.

5|$|Steel {{made from}} cast iron through oxygenation: The {{earliest}} known production of steel {{is a piece}} of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in Anatolia (Kaman-Kalehoyuk) and is about 4,000 years old. Other ancient steel comes from East Africa, dating back to 1400 BC. In the 4th century BC steel weapons like the Falcata were produced in the Iberian Peninsula, while Noric steel was used by the Roman military. The Chinese, who had been producing cast iron from the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC), produced steel by the 2nd century BC through a process of decarburization, i.e. using bellows to pump large amounts of oxygen on to molten cast iron. This was first described in the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) book Huainanzi, compiled by scholars under Prince Liu An (179–122 BC). For steel, they used both quenching (i.e. rapid cooling) and tempering (i.e. slow cooling) methods of heat treatment. Much later, the American inventor William Kelly (1811–1888) brought four Chinese metallurgists to Eddyville, Kentucky in 1845, whose expertise in steelmaking influenced his ideas about air injection to reduce <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> of iron; his invention anticipated the Bessemer process of English inventor Henry Bessemer (1813–1898).|$|E

5|$|Dao: Daos are single-edged Chinese swords, {{primarily}} {{used for}} slashing and chopping. The {{most common form}} {{is also known as}} the Chinese sabre, although those with wider blades are sometimes referred to as Chinese broadswords. In China, the dao {{is considered one of the}} four traditional weapons, along with the gun (stick or staff), qiang (spear), and the jian (sword). The earliest dao date from the Shang Dynasty in China's Bronze Age, and are known as zhibeidao (直背刀)– straight backed knives. As the name implies, these were straight-bladed or slightly curved weapons with a single edge. Originally bronze, these weapons were made of iron or steel by the time of the late Warring States period as metallurgical knowledge became sufficiently advanced to control the <b>carbon</b> <b>content.</b> Originally less common as a military weapon than the jian– the straight, double-edged blade of China– the dao became popular with cavalry during the Han dynasty due to its sturdiness, superiority as a chopping weapon, and relative ease of use– it was generally said that it takes a week to attain competence with a dao/saber, a month to attain competence with a qiang/spear, and a year to attain competence with a jian/straight sword. Soon after dao began to be issued to infantry, beginning the replacement of the jian as a standard-issue weapon. Late Han dynasty dao had round grips and ring-shaped pommels, and ranged between 85 and 114 centimeters in length. These weapons were used alongside rectangular shields.|$|E

It was hypothesized that the carbon stocks and stability varied with land use and altitudinal gradient. Results showed that the soils in the tropical highland rainforest site presented the higher (p > 0. 05) <b>carbon</b> <b>contents</b> (134 g kg− 1 [13. 4 %]). Coffee plantations in the tropical highland rainforest and alfalfa under irrigation in the dry valleys presented larger (p > 0. 05) carbon stocks (83 Mg ha− 1 [37 tn ac− 1]) than primary rainforests. The dry lowlands showed the lowest <b>carbon</b> <b>contents</b> (51 g kg− 1 [5. 1 %]) and carbon stocks (40 Mg ha− 1 [18 tn ac− 1]).

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{determine}} the phosphorus, nitrogen, and <b>carbon</b> <b>contents</b> of aquatic macrophyte species during two periods {{of the year in the}} land-water transition zone of three lakes lateral to the Paranapanema River (São Paulo); METHODS: Plants, water, and sediment were collected during two distinct periods (August 1998 and February 1999) in three transects perpendicular to littoral zones of the sampled sites. For the determination of the phosphorus, nitrogen and <b>carbon</b> <b>contents</b> of aquatic macrophyte species, aerial and submerged plant structures (leaves, roots, and stems) were used; RESULTS: In Camargo Lake, which has a poor connection with the river during the dry period (August 1998), the highest nitrogen content was obtained for Salvinia auriculata Aublet, while the highest phosphorus contest was observed for Eichhornia azurea (Swartz) Kunth. During the rainy season (February 1999), Echinochloa polystachya (H. B. K.) Hitch was the species with the highest phosphorus, nitrogen, and <b>carbon</b> <b>contents.</b> In Coqueiral Lake (a lake with great connectivity to the river), the highest phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations during the dry period were observed for Cyperus esculentus L. Similar <b>carbon</b> <b>contents</b> were found for both C. esculentus and Eichhornia azurea. During the rainy season, the species with the highest phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations were E. polystachya, Ludwigia octovalvis (Jacq.) P. H. Raven, and Polygonum spectabile Mart. Considering the plants recorded during the dry period in Cavalos Lake, which is isolated from the river, Myriophyllum aquaticum (Vellozo) Verdcourt was the species with the highest phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations. During the rainy period, C. esculentus and E. azurea had the highest nitrogen concentration. All the aquatic macrophyte species presented similar <b>carbon</b> <b>contents.</b> The highest phosphorus concentration was that of C. esculentus; CONCLUSIONS: The bottom of Camargo and Coqueiral Lakes (both with permanent connection with the river) and some sites of Cavalos (an isolated lake) can be considered similar. They were characterized by sediment with more phosphorus, organic matter, silt, and clay than other sites, which can affect the macro-nutrient content of macrophytes. In the isolated lake, the degradation of submerged plants at the land-water interface contributed to the nutrient pool of aquatic macrophytes after rainfall...|$|R
