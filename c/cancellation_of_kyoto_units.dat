40|$|A {{series of}} {{decisions}} made at COP 18 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) imposes considerable {{restrictions on use}} <b>of</b> the <b>Kyoto</b> mecha-nisms by countries that do not submit greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets for the sec-ond commitment period <b>of</b> the <b>Kyoto</b> Protocol, including Japan. As a result, a substantive decrease in the amount <b>of</b> <b>Kyoto</b> <b>units</b> 1 that can be acquired by these countries post- 2012 seems to be unavoidable. Taking into account {{the impact of these}} COP 18 decisions on Japan, the following points have been found...|$|R
25|$|Almost all European {{countries}} are {{on track to}} achieve their first-round Kyoto targets. Spain plans to meet its target by purchasing a large quantity <b>of</b> <b>Kyoto</b> <b>units</b> through the flexibility mechanisms. Australia, Canada (Canada withdrew from the Kyoto treaty in 2012), and Italy are not on course to meet their first-round Kyoto targets. In order to meet their targets, these countries would need to purchase emissions credits from other Kyoto countries. As noted in the section on Intergovernmental Emissions Trading, purchasing surplus credits from the EIT countries would not actually result in total emissions being reduced. An alternative would be the purchase of CDM credits {{or the use of}} the voluntary Green Investment Scheme.|$|R
5|$|In {{combination}} with the unlimited use <b>of</b> internationally sourced <b>Kyoto</b> <b>units,</b> the allocation <b>of</b> New Zealand units to eligible emitters in proportion to their production {{means that there is}} no cap on total emissions within New Zealand.|$|R
2500|$|Under the GIS a Party to the Protocol {{expecting that}} the {{development}} of its economy will not exhaust its Kyoto quota, can sell the excess <b>of</b> its <b>Kyoto</b> quota <b>units</b> (AAUs) to another Party. The proceeds from the AAU sales should be [...] "greened", i.e. channeled to {{the development and implementation of}} the projects either acquiring the greenhouse gases emission reductions (hard greening) or building up the necessary framework for this process (soft greening).|$|R
30|$|In New Zealand, an {{emissions}} trading scheme {{was introduced in}} 2009 and forestry was the first sector to be included, generating an initial stimulus of forest plantings for sequestration. In 2011, for example, new forest plantings were almost double the previous year at 12 000 ha (New Zealand Forest Owners Association 2013). However, scheme design issues have since eroded the incentives for planted forests through low domestic carbon prices and high volatility and risk brought about {{by a series of}} amendments to the scheme. The depressed New Zealand carbon prices are attributed to the partial sectoral coverage of the scheme and strong linkage to uncapped international carbon trading <b>of</b> <b>Kyoto</b> compliant <b>units,</b> which have also fallen significantly in recent years. Under the New Zealand scheme, any credits are also balanced against any liability from the net release of carbon at harvest.|$|R
5000|$|An {{account holder}} can {{therefore}} hold, transfer, cancel or acquire EU Allowances (EUAs) and <b>Kyoto</b> <b>units</b> (e.g. CERs, ERUs, AAUs, RMUs, tCERs and lCERs). Further details regarding {{each of these}} unit types {{can be found in}} A Guide to Using <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Units</b> in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, available on the [...] Environment Agency’s website. In addition, regulators and nominated competent authorities can manage regulated industries (those with legal emissions reduction targets), and monitor national compliance and performance against international emissions reductions obligations.|$|R
5|$|On 6 December 2007, the New Zealand Emission Unit Register (NZEUR) was established. The NZEUR has {{the role}} of issuing, holding, {{transferring}} and retiring emission units in terms <b>of</b> the <b>Kyoto</b> Protocol. The initial use of the NZEUR was to record <b>Kyoto</b> emission <b>units</b> allocated to firms enrolled in the Ministry for the Environment’s Projects to Reduce Emissions and Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements programmes, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry’s Permanent Forest Sink Initiative.|$|R
