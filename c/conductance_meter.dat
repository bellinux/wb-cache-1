50|$|Acid-base titrations {{depend on}} the {{neutralization}} between an acid and a base when mixed in solution. In addition to the sample, an appropriate pH indicator {{is added to the}} titration chamber, reflecting the pH range of the equivalence point. The acid-base indicator indicates the endpoint of the titration by changing color. The endpoint and the equivalence point are not exactly the same because the equivalence point is determined by the stoichiometry of the reaction while the endpoint is just the color change from the indicator. Thus, a careful selection of the indicator will reduce the indicator error. For example, if the equivalence point is at a pH of 8.4, then the Phenolphthalein indicator would be used instead of Alizarin Yellow because phenolphthalein would reduce the indicator error. Common indicators, their colors, and the pH range in which they change color are given in the table above. When more precise results are required, or when the reagents are a weak acid and a weak base, a pH meter or a <b>conductance</b> <b>meter</b> are used.|$|E

40|$|Multiphase flows, {{where two}} or even three fluids flow {{simultaneously}} in a pipe {{are becoming increasingly}} important in industry. Although much {{research has been done}} to measure the phase flow rates of two-phase flows using a Venturi meter, accurate flow rate measurements of two phase flows in vertical and horizontal pipes at different flow regimes using a Venturi meter remain elusive. In water continuous multiphase flow, the electrical conductance technique has proven attractive for many industrial applications. In gas-water two phase flows, the electrical conductance technique can be used to measure the gas volume fraction. The electrical conductance is typically measured by passing a known electrical current through the flow and then measure the voltage drop between two electrodes in the pipe. Once the current and the voltage drop are obtained, the conductance (or resistance) of the mixture, which depends on the gas volume fraction in the water, can then be calculated. The principal aim of the research described in this thesis was to develop a novel <b>conductance</b> multiphase flow <b>meter</b> which is capable of measuring the gas and the water flow rates in vertical annular flows and horizontal stratified gas water two phase flows. This thesis investigates the homogenous and separated (vertical annular and horizontal stratified) gas-water two phase flows through Venturi meters. In bubbly(approximately homogenous) two phase flow, the universal Venturi meter (nonconductance Venturi) was used in conjunction with the Flow Density Meter, FDM (which is capable of measuring the gas volume fraction at the inlet of the Venturi) to measure the mixture flow rate using the homogenous flow model. Since the separated flow in a Venturi meter is highly complex and the application of the homogenous flow model could not be expected to lead to highly accurate results, a novel <b>conductance</b> multiphase flow <b>meter,</b> which consists of the Conductance Inlet Void Fraction Meter, CIVFM (that is capable of measuring the gas volume fraction at the inlet of the Venturi) and the <b>Conductance</b> Multiphase Venturi <b>Meter,</b> CMVM (that is capable of measuring the gas volume fraction at the throat of the Venturi) was designed and manufactured allowing the new separated flow model to be used to determine the gas and the water flow rates. A new model for separated flows has been investigated. This model was used to calculate the phase flow rates of water and gas flows in a horizontal stratified flow. This model was also modified to be used in a vertical annular flow. The new separated flow model is based on the measurement of the gas volume fraction at the inlet and the throat of the Venturi meter rather than relying on prior knowledge of the mass flow quality x. Online measurement of x is difficult and not practical in nearly all multiphase flow applications. The advantage of the new model described in this thesis over the previous models available in the literature is that the new model does not require prior knowledge of the mass flow quality which makes the measurement technique described in this thesis more practical.

40|$|In the {{international}} {{oil and gas}} industry multiphase annular flow in pipelines and wells is extremely important, but not well understood. This thesis reports the development of an efficient and cheap method for measuring the phase flow rates in two phase annular and annular mist flow, in which the liquid phase is electrically conducting, using ultrasonic and conductance techniques. The method measures changes in the conductance of the liquid film formed during annular flow and uses these to calculate the volumetric and mass flow rates of the liquid film. The gas velocity in the core of the annular flow is measured using an ultrasonic technique. Combined with an entrainment model and the liquid film measurements described above, the ultrasonic technique enables the volumetric flow rate of the gas in the core and the volumetric and mass flow rates of entrained liquid droplets to be measured. This study was based on experimental work and the use of modelling techniques. The practical investigation comprised a series of experiments conducted on a purpose built flow loop in which the test section was a Perspex pipe of 50 mm ID. The experimental work was limited to two-phase air-water flow. The flow loop was specifically designed to accommodate the different instruments and subsystems designed in this investigation including bespoke flow meters and a film extraction system. Most flow loop controls were automated using a MATLAB program. Reference measurement of the total water flow rate was made using a calibrated turbine flow meter and of the air flow rate using a calibrated rotameter. For the combined ultrasonic/conductance method investigated in this thesis, the velocity of the gas in the core was found using a novel Ultrasonic Flow Meter (USFM). The positioning and arrangement of the transducers have never been used previously. The flow velocity of the liquid film and the thickness of the film were measured using a novel <b>Conductance</b> Flow <b>Meter</b> (CFM). The CFM measured the liquid film thickness using novel wall conductance probes. By cross correlating the signals from a pair of such probes the film velocity was obtained. Good agreement of the experimental results obtained from the CFM and USFM with results published in the literature was found. Although not investigated experimentally in the work described in this thesis, annular flows encountered in the oil industry may contain a liquid phase comprising a mixture of oil and water. For such flows, the volume fractions of the oil and water can be measured using an automated bypass system developed during this project. The bypass system periodically extracts part of the liquid film, measures its density and then releases the sample back into the pipeline. The liquid phase volume fractions are determined from this density measurement which can be performed more than once per minute. An entrainment model was developed, which is required by the ultrasonic/conductance flow metering technique described in this thesis, in which the mass fraction of the liquid flowing as entrained droplets in the core can be determined from the liquid film thickness and velocity measurements. A mathematical model was also developed to describe the properties of the liquid film, such as liquid velocity profile within the film, and the model’s results were found to agree with the experimental results obtained during the project and also with previous work cited in the literature. The complexity of this latter model was reduced by making a number of simplifying assumptions, which are presented and discussed in the thesis, including the assumption that in annular flow there is a dynamic balance liquid entrainment and droplets being deposited back onto the film. The combination of the designed CFM and USFM with the bypass tube and the entrainment model offer the opportunity for a ‘wet gas’ flow meter to be developed to measure two and three phase annular flows at relatively low cost and with enhanced accuracy. Such a device would have the advantage that it would by substantially smaller than systems using separators and it could even be retrofitted onto off-shore platforms. The integration of the subsystems developed in this project into a single system capable of giving on-line measurements of annular flow would be a major benefit to the author’s sponsor, Petroleum Development of Oman.

40|$|Waterlogging {{has been}} {{reported}} to reduce crop yields by up to 80 %, although the lack of a consistent definition of waterlogging or specific effects on plants makes it hard to accurately ascribe crop yield losses to waterlogging relative to other abiotic stresses. After reviewing the available literature I suggest that recording soil profile information, topographic data, meteorological information, plant morphological appearance and areas with visible surface water are the most important factors for describing waterlogging in the field. An above ground plant response to waterlogging that is easily identifiable in some species is leaf wilting. Reduced root hydraulic conductance was investigated as the possible cause of leaf wilting by waterlogging Glycine max L. and Nicotiana glutinosa L. under greenhouse conditions. During these experiments a defined sequence of plant responses and adaptations to waterlogging was established. Waterlogged soybean showed very little change in plant physiology or morphology implying a low sensitivity to reduced root zone soil oxygen concentration [O₂]. At {{the other end of the}} waterlogging sensitivity scale before [O₂] reached 10 % there was a 50 % reduction in root dry weight of N. glutinosa on day 2 of waterlogging. On day 3 of waterlogging there was decreased stomatal conductance and leaf water potential, both measures indicating water deficit stress. However, apparent root hydraulic conductance measured with a hydraulic <b>conductance</b> flow <b>meter</b> (HCFM) increased, as did petiole and leaf hydraulic conductance. There was no evidence of aerenchyma formation in roots although there was extensive breakdown of endodermal cells in the waterlogged roots. It is suggested that root water uptake was severely impaired by this loss of cellular integrity. An implication from this is that water uptake is primarily in response to osmotic gradients and active water transfer across root cell membranes rather than a response to the hydrostatic potential gradient from the free water surrounding the roots into the root xylem. The breakdown of root anatomical integrity seems likely to be associated with the apparent increase in measured root hydraulic conductance. Care should be taken in applying the HCFM measurement technique to root systems that are anatomically damaged. Evidence from the literature and observations from the current experiments highlight the multiple and varied responses of different species to waterlogging. This apparent variation makes the development of general plant waterlogging response models very challenging. To address this, a framework was developed that identifies three stages of response by plants to the onset of waterlogging; an initial increase in plant growth and function, followed by decreased growth and function as [O₂] decreases, and finally, a species specific adaptation phase that places the species in a range from highly sensitive to highly tolerant. Using this response framework, the generic crop growth and yield simulation model SWAGMAN Destiny was modified to improve the representation of waterlogging response in common crop species with a particular focus on wheat. An empirical representation of decreased gas filled pore space by soil layer, the depth of the layer, the root length and the duration of saturated conditions were used to derive a waterlogging stress factor. This stress factor was then used to change the distribution of roots in the soil profile and aggregated to provide a plant stress factor that modified carbohydrate production from the plant leaf area. In essence, the waterlogging stress factor is used as a collective representation of the above empirical processes, and changing root hydraulic conductivity that we observed in response to low [O₂]. The simulated output yields were consistent with experimental results and published field trial results. In compiling information on specific species sensitivity to waterlogging in field conditions it became obvious that rigorous comparison was extremely difficult since there is a lack of consistency around the duration and timing of waterlogging, the soil profile, topography and climate. This reality means that simulation modelling that represents the physiological processes of waterlogging and the response processes of plants has an important role in assisting understanding of a waterlogged soil plant system. I recommend any crop model that explicitly includes waterlogging as an abiotic stress should demonstrate the three stage response as supported by outputs from SWAGMAN Destiny. Thesis (Ph. D.)
