5|$|A short {{distance}} to the north, NY78 and NY104 fork in different directions, with NY104 following Ridge Road to the northeast and NY78 running along LockportOlcott Road to the northwest. Still {{in the town of}} Newfane, NY78 proceeds northwest as a four-lane (quickly <b>changing</b> <b>to</b> two-lane) residential street. The route passes east of Bent-Wing Airport, continuing northwest through Newfane. The route remains residential for a distance, crossing over a brook on its way into the hamlet of Corwin. In Corwin, NY78 remains a two-lane residential road, crossing over Somerset Railroad tracks that are operated by CSX Transportation (heading for the Somerset Power Plant near Camp Kenan) north of Jacques Avenue. Now paralleling Eighteenmile Creek, NY78 intersects with the western terminus of CR105 (Hatter Road). While winding northwest, the route soon enters the hamlet of Newfane.|$|E

5|$|East Stirlingshire's home colours {{have been}} {{black and white}} hoops {{for most of its}} {{existence}} since 1882. The club's first strip was thin blue and white hoops between 1880 and 1882, before <b>changing</b> <b>to</b> colours similar to the present day. An all-black shirt was introduced between 1960 and 1962, and again between 2008 and 2010, while the club's centenary strip in 1981 was all-white. In 1996–97, the stripes were changed from horizontal to vertical for a full season; a similar design featured for one month in August 1982 before changing back.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these bank acquisitions, UBS also acquired an 80% stake in Argor SA, a Swiss precious metal refinery founded in 1951, through whom they started to issue UBS branded gold bars. In 1973, the bank increased the stake to full 100% ownership only to withdraw by 1999 with ownership of the refinery <b>changing</b> <b>to</b> Hereaus & Management. Nevertheless, UBS continues to issue gold bars via Argor-Heraeus which is famous for the unique kinebar holographic technology it uses to provide enhanced protection against bank gold bar counterfeiting.|$|E

Kispiro made it to the 5000 metres final as the slowest qualifier and secured a fifteenth-place finish, and took a tenth-position result in the 10,000 metres despite falling onto the track's surface. Thomas Ayeko finished in sixteenth in the same event. Kiprotich won the men's marathon, securing Uganda's first gold medal since 1972.|$|E

5|$|The Amtrak {{ticket office}} was closed in April 2001 {{as part of}} {{austerity}} measures. Vandalism also forced the closure of elevators. The same year, SEPTA proposed closing the station because it served few inbound commuters. However, advocacy from the Delaware Valley Association of Rail Passengers, which showed that the station was more heavily used by commuters from the Chestnut Hill West Line <b>changing</b> <b>to</b> SEPTA Trenton Line trains and Amtrak Clockers to Trenton and New York, succeeded in persuading SEPTA to keep the station open for the time being.
