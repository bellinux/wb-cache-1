The first part involved the investigation of a new fumigant - <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide,</b> which {{has the potential to}} replace methyl bromide. Its biological response or activity was investigated, e. g. toxicity to target organisms and phytotoxicity, environmental and worker safety considerations. In the second investigation, analytical methods were developed for the determination of fumigant movement through timber and fumigant residues in grains as well as a method of chemical fractionation to determine the fate of <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide.</b> A comprehensive literature review of 161 references in these two areas is reported. <b>Carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> was highly toxic to adults of three coleopteran species tested, namely Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), Tribolium confusum du Val, and Sitophilus oryzae (L.), the most sensitive species was R. dominica. For 6 hr exposure at 25 ?C, the L(CxT) 95 value for R. dominica, S. oryzae and T. confusum were, respectively, 36. 48, 99. 82 and 113. 0 mg h L- 1. <b>Carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> inhibited 100 % of mould in wet wheat and more than 90 % of mould on dry wheat at lOOmg L- 1. Both <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> and hydrogen cyanide were low in phytotoxicity without affecting germination of wheat, at levels needed to control insects. Unlike hydrogen cyanide, <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> can be used at minimum levels without decreasing plumule length of wheat. Chemical data on the sorption of <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> are compared with data from methyl bromide. The levels of <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> in the headspace of five commodities (wheat, barley, paddy, sorghum and peanut) and timbers (hardwood and softwood) decay more slowly than do levels of methyl bromide. <b>Carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> was blown through a column of wheat as easily as was phosphine and more easily than was methyl bromide, and its front was blown out faster than phosphine and methyl bromide. Movement of two fumigants (methyl bromide and <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide)</b> through, and sorption on, softwood and hardwood were studied. Each fumigant was sorbed less on softwood than on hardwood and penetrated softwood better than hardwood. <b>Carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> penetrated timber better than did methyl bromide, and was less sorbed on timber. A rapid method of solvent extraction was developed to enable rapid estimation of the amount on intact fumigant sorbed in wood. This procedure enabled near quantitative recovery of methyl bromide as either intact fumigant or as bromide ion. <b>Carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> residue in unfumigated wheat was found to be around 25 - SOppb. <b>Carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> left little residue on fumigated grains. Desorption of <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> from the wheat was extremely fast, 85 % of it was released after one day aeration which was very much greater than that of methyl bromide and carbon disulphide. After 6 days aeration the incorporation of 14 COS on mungbean, wheat, paddy, rice and safflower was lower than 7 Oppb (calculated as COS equivalent). Food value or nutritional quality of foodstuffs is not harmed by <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> fumigation. This result was assessed by identifying any nonreversible change or combined residues in biochemical fractions of commodities including lipids, protein, amino acids, carbohydrate, etc., and no irreversible reaction between <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> and any constituent such as B vitamin, atocopherol, lysine, maltose and starch. Fumigants did not affect lipids, although each fumigant was applied to wheat at exaggerated concentrations, nor wheat germ oil and canola oil treated with extremely high concentration of fumigants. Factors which affect analysis of fumigants including stability of chemicals in extraction solvent and partitioning of fumigant between solvent and air, were examined. The partition ratio, defined as the fumigant concentration in extraction solvent to that in the headspace, varied with fumigant. Methods for multi-fumigant analysis were developed or modified and gave high recoveries and efficiency. The procedure of Daft of solvent extraction followed by partitioning was modified by being performed in sealed flasks. This raised the recovery of <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide,</b> methyl bromide, phosphine and carbon disulphide. Recoveries were near quantitative at levels down to 6 - 16 ppb (w/w) for tested fumigants. Thus the modified Daft method can be adapted to enable determination of the main fumigants used on staple foodstuffs. Microwave irradiation method give higher efficiency of removal of fumigants from grains. Limits of quantification were < 0. 2 ng g- 1 (ppb w/w) for each tested fumigant. The detection limit of COS was calculated, as natural levels of the fumigant were detected in commodities. These are feasible, simple and rapid (< 2 min.) to be use to analyse fumigant residue in grains. <b>Carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> has potential as a fumigant for grain and timber and may replace methyl bromide in some uses, subject to further investigation in commercial situations...|$|E
40|$|Australian {{scientists}} have found that <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide,</b> known to science for many years, {{has the potential to}} replace methyl bromide as a grain and soil fumigant (see Spore 47 p 10). Although methyl bromide is the cheapest and easiest fumigant to use, it is environmentally damaging and has been cited as one of the main culprits in the destruction of the ozone layer. Under the Montreal Protocol, it has been proposed that methyl bromide should be banned within a few years. There are alternative compounds such as phosphine but they are slower acting and more difficult to use, and insects are becoming resistant to them. Scientists have been searching for an alternative for years yet to the surprise of scientists at Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), no one considered <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide.</b> In laboratory trials <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide,</b> although not as powerful as methyl bromide, produced results almost as effective against both grain and soil pests. The next step is to get <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> registered as a fumigant {{so that it can be}} tested in the field. The compound does occur naturally in the atmosphere so CSIRO feel that its use will not cause environmental damage.

3000|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to convert {{polypropylene}} waste into usable liquid fuel via pyrolysis [...] technique using kaolin as a low-cost catalyst. Waste polypropylene was thermally and catalytically degraded in a chemical vapour deposition (CVD) horizontal glass reactor at a temperature of 450  °C, residence time of 30  min, and heating rate of 30  °C/min. The kaolin clay was characterized by XRF analysis while the ultimate and proximate analysis of the polypropylene feed carried out gave combustible materials content of 93.77  wt%, fixed carbon of 1.62  wt%, calorific value of 45.20  MJ/kg and elemental composition with carbon (83.65 %), hydrogen (14.27 %), oxygen (0.15 %), sulphur (0.1 %), chlorine (1.16 %), and nitrogen (0.67 %). Thermal cracking was carried out in the absence of catalyst and the process gave a yield of liquid, gaseous, and solid products of 67.48, 8.85, and 23.67  wt%, respectively. Furthermore, kaolin clay was employed as a catalyst in catalytic pyrolysis of the same feedstock for catalyst-to-plastic ratio of 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 3, and 1 : 4 at the same operating parameters as in thermal cracking. Optimum yield was obtained at a catalyst-to-plastic ratio of 1 : 3 with a yield of 79.85, 1.48, and 18.67  wt% for liquid, gaseous, and solid products, respectively. The liquid products obtained for both thermal and catalytic cracking at optimum conditions were characterized for their suitability as fuel. The properties determined were density, viscosity, flash point, fire point, pour point, and calorific value. The results suggest that catalytic pyrolysis produced liquid products, whose properties are comparable to conventional fuels (gasoline and diesel oil) than that produced through thermal pyrolysis. FTIR analysis of the liquid product from catalytic pyrolysis also shows that it contains hydrocarbons with different functional groups such as aromatics, olefins, <b>carbonyl,</b> amines, <b>sulphides,</b> and hydroxyl.|$|R
40|$|Methods {{to study}} {{movement}} of fumigant through timber were improved, and procedures were developed that obviated {{the need for}} sampling lines. Movement for two fumigants (methyl bromide and <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide)</b> through, and sorption on, heartwood of softwood and hardwood were studied. Each fumigant was sorbed less on softwood than on hardwood and penetrated softwood better than hardwood. Neither fumigant penetrated across the grain. <b>Carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> penetrated timber better than did methyl bromide, and was less sorbed on timber.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} one of {{the laser}} absorption spectroscopy techniques as an effective tool for sensitive analysis of trace gas species in human breath. Characterization of nitric oxide, <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> and ethane, and the selection of their absorption lines are described. Experiments with some biomarkers showed that detection of pathogenic changes {{at the molecular level}} is possible using this technique. Thanks to cavity enhanced spectroscopy application, detection limits at the ppb-level and short measurements time (< 3 s) were achieved. Absorption lines of reference samples of the selected volatile biomarkers were probed using a distributed feedback quantum cascade laser and a tunable laser system consisting of an optical parametric oscillator and difference frequency generator. Setup using the first source provided a detection limit of 30 ppb for nitric oxide and 250 ppb for <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide.</b> During experiments employing a second laser, detection limits of 0. 9 ppb and 0. 3 ppb were obtained for <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> and ethane, respectively. The conducted experiments show that this type of diagnosis would significantly increase chances for effective therapy of some diseases. Additionally, it offers non-invasive and real time measurements, high sensitivity and selectivity as well as minimizing discomfort for patients. For that reason, such sensors can be used in screening for early detection of serious diseases...|$|E

Lactating goats received 35 S orally as single administrations of sulphate, l-methionine, or grass contaminated either through root uptake of 35 S as sulphate or through aerial deposition of 35 S as <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> onto the grass. Transfer was higher for 35 S administered as methionine compared with 35 S administered as sulphate. Changes in activity concentrations in milk for all sources of 35 S demonstrated two components of loss. The first component had a half-life of circa 1 d for all sources, the second was longer in goats administered <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> (44 d) than {{in all of the}} other treatments (circa 10 d). The rate of transfer of 35 S to milk of a further group of goats receiving 35 S-sulphate daily appeared to reach equilibrium within 30 d.

40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} core-excited {{molecules}} using three-dimensional multi particle momentum imaging are presented where bond rearrangement processes in dication species are analysed. The {{aim of the}} study is to understand the relation between the geometric changes associated with core-excited states and the kinetic energy released in particular molecular dissociation processes. The kinematics of individual fragmentation channels are studied by fully three-dimensional momentum imaging of fragments in coincidence. Examples are presented where the high efficiency of the instrument and the fully three-dimensional momentum capabilities are exploited to understand nuclear motion leading to bond rearrangement in core-excited states. We identify bond-rearrangement processes in water, <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> and acetylene which are initiated in the core-excited state. In water this is evidenced by the H- 2 (+) /O+ ion pair, and in <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> the OS++C+ pair is the fingerprint of this reaction. In acetylene the H- 2 (+) + C- 2 (+) ion pair indicates a molecular geometry that changes from linear to strongly bent. We measure the angular distribution of all fragments and fragment pairs and for the bond rearrangement processes in water and in core-excited acetylene the angular distribution of fragments suggests that the bond rearrangement is very rapid...|$|E
40|$|The {{electronic}} state spectroscopy of <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide,</b> COS, {{has been}} investigated using high resolution vacuum ultraviolet photoabsorption spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy in the energy range of 4. 0 – 10. 8 eV. The spectrum reveals several new features not previously reported in the literature. Vibronic structure has been observed, notably in the low energy absorption dipole forbidden band assigned to the (4 π← 3 π) (1 Δ← 1 Σ+) transition, with a new weak transition assigned to (1 Σ−← 1 Σ+) reported {{here for the first}} time. The absolute optical oscillator strengths are determined for ground state to 1 Σ+ and 1 Π transitions. Based on our recent measurements of differential cross sections for the optically allowed (1 Σ+ and 1 Π) transitions of COS by electron impact, the optical oscillator strength f 0 value and integral cross sections (ICSs) are derived by applying a generalized oscillator strength analysis. Subsequently, ICSs predicted by the scaling are confirmed down to 60 eV in the intermediate energy region. The measured absolute photoabsorption cross sections have been used to calculate the photolysis lifetime of <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> in the upper stratosphere (20 – 50 km) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{sulphur cycle}} plays {{fundamental}} {{roles in the}} chemistry and climate of Venus. Thermodynamic equilibrium chemistry at the surface of Venus favours the production of <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> {{and to a lesser}} extent sulphur dioxide. These gases are transported to the middle atmosphere by the Hadley circulation cell. Above the cloud top, a sulphur oxidation cycle involves conversion of <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> into sulphur dioxide, which is then transported further upwards. A significant fraction of this sulphur dioxide is subsequently oxidized to sulphur trioxide and eventually reacts with water to form sulphuric acid. Because the vapour pressure of sulphuric acid is low, it readily condenses and forms an upper cloud layer at altitudes of 60 – 70 [*]km, and an upper haze layer above 70 [*]km (ref. 9), which effectively sequesters sulphur oxides from photochemical reactions. Here we present simulations of the fate of sulphuric acid in the Venusian mesosphere based on the Caltech/JPL kinetics model, but including the photolysis of sulphuric acid. Our model suggests that the mixing ratios of sulphur oxides are at least five times higher above 90 [*]km when the photolysis of sulphuric acid is included. Our results are inconsistent with the previous model results but in agreement with the recent observations using ground-based microwave spectroscopy and by Venus Express...|$|E

The o bserved wave packet motion exhibits strong transientmolecular orientation after the control laser pulse has been switched off. The experimentally attained degree of orientation〈cos θ〉 ≈ 0. 6 corresponds to the theoretical maximum for mixing of the two states. Simulations show that switchingoff the static field would provide the same orientation complete ly field free...|$|E

We have measured the COS concentrations at the tropical tropopause and find mixing ratios 20 - 50 % larger than assumed in models. The enhanced COS levels are correlated with high concentrations of biomass burning pollutants like CO and HCN. The analysis of backward trajectories and global maps of fire statistics suggest that biomass burning emissions transported upwards by deep convection are the source of the enhanced COS in the upper tropical troposphere...|$|E

40|$|New {{fumigants}} {{are needed}} to control grain insects because methyl bromide is being phased out as an ozone-depleting substance under the Montreal Protocol and because resistance to phosphine is increasing. Alternative fumigants also provide one strategy to manage resistance. To assess the effect of candidate fumigants on barley quality, malting and brewing trials were conducted with malting barley (Schooner), 9. 4 % moisture content, fumigated with <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> (COS), ethyl formate (EF) and carbon disulphide (CS 2) at concentrations of 20, 90 and 36 mg/L respectively for 7 days at 20 °C in riveted steel silos containing 33 t of barley. The appropriate industry body, the Malting and Brewing Industry Barley Technical Committee (MBIBTC) set the quality parameters to be evaluated and allocated work to the appropriate quality laboratories. Germination of fumigated barley was not affected by the fumigants. Residues of COS, EF and CS 2 in outloading barley samples were 0. 085 ± 0. 0052, 0. 4 ± 0. 1 and 2. 22 ± 0. 07 mg/kg respectively, which were below the experimental permits of maximum residue levels (MRL). Residues of COS, EF and CS 2 in malt, wort and beer were indistinguishable from those in unfumigated (or non-fumigated) barley. Ethyl formate and CS 2 affected wort in increasing the apparent attenuation limit (AAL) and CS 2 affected barley colour. Sulphur volatiles in the trial beer made from EF and CS 2 (unlike COS) fumigated barley decreased significantly. Beer from COS, EF and CS 2 fumigated barley had a somewhat higher 24 -hour chill haze level (0. 62 – 0. 84) than beer from the untreated barley (0. 53). The total alcohols and isoamyl acetate increased in beer made from EF fumigated barley. <b>Carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide,</b> EF and CS 2, however, {{had no effect on}} beer flavour or quality...|$|E

40|$|Regional gross primary {{productivity}} (GPP) estimates {{are crucial to}} estimating carbon-climate feedbacks but are highly uncertain with existing methods. An emerging approach uses atmospheric <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> (COS) as a tracer for carbon dioxide: COS plant uptake is simulated by scaling GPP. A critical parameter for this method is leaf-scale relative uptake (LRU). Plant chamber and eddy covariance studies find a narrow range of LRU values but some atmospheric modelling studies assign values well outside this range. Here we study this discrepancy by conducting new regional chemical transport simulations for North America using the underlying data from previous studies. We find {{the wide range of}} ecosystem model GPP estimates can explain the discrepancy in LRU values. We also find that COS concentration uncertainty is more sensitive to GPP uncertainty than to LRU parameter uncertainty. These results support the COS tracer technique as a useful approach for constraining GPP estimates...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} study {{performed at}} B 3 LYP and CCSD(T) level of {{theory of the}} reaction of formation Of S 3 O+ in ionized carbonyl sulphide/disulpbur monoxide mixtures is reported here. The interaction of <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> with disulphur monoxide cation leads to three different [CS 3 O 2](+) isomers, essentially formed by a S 3 O+ cation solvated by a CO molecule. The S 3 O+ cation {{is present in the}} three structures cis, trans and ring, showed also by the isolated S 3 O+ species. The complex with the ring S 3 O+ unit is the most stable, but a direct ath to its formation starting from OCS and S 2 O+ has not been found in the potential energy surface Of [CS 3 O 2]+. This species can be obtained from the isomerization of the complexes containing the cis or trans S 3 O+ unit, overcoming relatively low barrier heights. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

Above 10 eV, the angular distributions {{are found to}} agree quite well with our present calculations using two semi-phenomenological theoretical approaches. One employs the independent-atom model with the screening-corrected additivity rule (IAM-SCAR), while the other uses the continuum-multiple-scattering method {{in conjunction with a}} parameter-free exchange-polarization approximation. Since OCS is a polar molecule, further dipole-induced rotational excitation cross sections have been calculated in the framework of the first Born approximation and incoherently added to the IAM-SCAR results. In comparison with the calculated DCS for the S atom, atomic-like behavior for the angular distributions in both the OCS and CS 2 scattering systems is observed.

The reaction photoproducts {{were identified by}} FTIR spectroscopy and interpretation of the experimental results was assisted by theoretical calculations of the infrared spectra at the DFT(B 3 LYP) / 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) level. Both compounds were found to undergo UV-induced α-cleavage photoreaction, however at different excitation wavelengths. The open ring aldehyde-ketene was generated from 2 (5 H) -furanone upon UV irradiation with λ > 235 nm light, while 2 (5 H) -thiophenone reacted at lower excitation energies (λ > 285 nm) with formation of thioaldehyde-ketene. At higher excitation energies (λ > 235 nm), thioaldehyde-ketene was transformed into the Dewar isomer and subsequently decomposed with formation of <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide,</b> while aldehyde-ketene did not react any further.

HNCS is hardly identified by mass spectrometry. Any evolution of H 2 S has not been detected at any stage of thiourea degradation by either of the two methods.

The first gaseous products of the dehydrated 1, evolved around 190 degreesC, are <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> (COS), carbon disulfide (CS 2), and cyanamide (NH 2 CN). At 240 degreesC isothiocyanic acid, HNCS becomes the main product, accompanied by CS 2, ammonia (NH 3) a small amount of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and traces of hydrogen chloride (HCI), according to EGA-FTIR spectroscopic analysis. At 250 degreesC formation of sulphur dioxide (SO 2) has been observed by EGA-mass spectrometry. SO 2 as air oxidation product of tin sulphides, formed in the previous stages, occurs also around 430 degreesC, while gaseous oxidation products of the organic residues, such as CO 2 and NH 2 CN are released at 515 degreesC. Both oxidation processes are accompanied by an exothermic heat effect. All species identified by FTIR gas cell are also confirmed by mass spectrometry, except HNCS. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{principal}} volatile sulphur species {{found in}} seawater are dimethyl sulphide (DMS), <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> (COS) and carbon disulphide (CS 2). Of these, DMS {{is the most}} abundant and widespread in its distribution. The predominant oceanic source of DMS is dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP), a compatible solute synthesized by phytoplankton for osmoregulation and/or cryoprotection. Not all species have the same ability to form DMSP; for example, diatoms generally produce little, whereas prymnesiophytes and some dinoflagellates make significantly larger amounts. Much of the release of DMSP and DMS to the water occurs on death or through predation of the plankton. Our recent field data strongly suggest that oxidation of DMS to dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) is an important process in the water column, {{and it is clear}} that considerable internal cycling in the DMSP/DMS/DMSO system occurs in the euphotic zone. A fraction of the DMS crosses the sea surface and enters the atmosphere where it is oxidized by radicals such as OH and NO 3 to form products such as methanesulphonate (MSA), DMSO and non-sea salt sulphate (NSSS) particles. These particles are the main source of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) over oceanic areas remote from land...|$|E
40|$|Operationally only pressure, {{temperature}} and six significant trace gases are retrieved by ESA from MIPAS data. However, information on many other species is {{also present in}} the spectra. We apply {{a variety of techniques}} and our own retrieval model to retrieve the concentration of three other species: SO 2,OCS and SF 6. Sulphur Dioxide (SO 2) is an acidic gas with both natural and anthropogenic sources that is rapidly converted to sulphuric acid and hence sulphate aerosols in the atmosphere. <b>Carbonyl</b> <b>Sulphide</b> (OCS) is produced naturally at the ocean surface and by biomass burning and, through stratospheric oxidation, it is thought to be the main contributor to non-volcanic stratospheric sulphate aerosols. Sulphur Hexafluoride (SF 6) is almost entirely anthropogenic in its origins and shows steady year-on-year increases making it useful for age of air and tracer studies. We anticipate the good global coverage and continuity of data will make MIPAS useful for the determination of changes and trends in the quantity and distribution of these species both natural and anthropogenic. In this paper we summarise the current progress that has been made in the retrieval of these important sulphur-containing species. We show some preliminary zonal mean fields and briefly outline the methods applied...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{volatile}} hydrocarbons, {{as well as}} methyl chloride, <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> {{and carbon}} disulphide, have been identified by mass spectrometry as products of Agaricus bisporus in the compost used in commercial mushroom beds. Of these, only ethylene showed a pattern of production that could be correlated with developmental phases of the crop, high levels being produced whenever fruit bodies were rapidly enlarging. In laboratory flask cultures, under controlled conditions, high levels of ethylene occurred whenever young fruit bodies entered the expansion phase. The enhanced rate of ethylene production continued over several days, irrespective of whether fruit bodies were removed. Production occurred within the colonized compost; no ethylene was evolved by the fruit body itself. When the first fruit bodies expanded, either in beds or culture flasks, laccase levels in the compost fell and those of a P- 1, 4 -glucanase (cellulase) rose. The enzyme switch occurred once only, during maturation of the first fruit bodies, whereas an elevated ethylene production was associated with each occasion when fruit body maturation took place. The low level of laccase and high level of cellulase characterized {{the whole of the}} reproductive stage of A. bisporus, whereas the phasic periods of high ethylene production distinguished between periods of fruit body maturation and intervening resting periods...|$|E
40|$|Identification and {{monitoring}} of gaseous species released during thermal decomposition {{of the title}} compound 1, Zn(tu) (2) Cl- 2, (tu=thiourea, (NH 2) (2) C=S) {{have been carried out}} in flowing air atmosphere up to 800 degreesC by both online coupled TG-EGA-FTIR and simultaneous TG/DTA-EGA-MS. The first gaseous products of 1, between 200 and 240 degreesC, are carbon disulfide (CS 2) and ammonia (NH 3). At 240 degreesC, an exothermic oxidation of CS 2 vapors occurs resulting in a sudden release of sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> (COS). An intense evolution of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and beginning of the evolution of cyanamide (H 2 NCN) and isothiocyanic acid (HNCS) are also observed just above 240 degreesC. Probably because of condensation and/or polymerization of cyanamide vapors on the windows and mirrors of the FTIR gas cell optics, some strange baseline shape changes are also occurring above 330 degreesC. Above 500 degreesC the oxidation process of organic residues appears to accelerate which is indicated by the increasing concentration of CO 2, while above 600 degreesC zinc sulfide starts to oxidize resulting in the evolution of SO 2. All species identified by FTIR gas cell were also confirmed by mass spectrometry, except for HNCS...|$|E
40|$|We present {{ground-based}} {{observations of}} the 2041 /cm (4. 9 micrometer) absorption feature toward the deeply embedded protostar W 33 A. We attribute this interstellar feature to solid <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> (OCS) embedded in icy grain mantles {{along the line of}} sight. We have made an extensive laboratory study of the infrared characteristics of OCS in various ice mixtures. Studies of the 2041 /cm band of solid OCS and solid mixtures containing OCS show that its shape and peak position are sensitive to the molecular environment of the OCS molecule. Mie scattering calculations show that the peak position and profile of the OCS band depend on the shape and size of the absorbing grain when the OCS concentration is larger than 0. 05. For lower OCS concentrations, laboratory-measured bulk spectra agree very well with the absorption spectra of small grains. We have compared the observed feature with laboratory and theoretical spectra of astrophysically relevant mixtures. The best agreement is obtained for mixtures with traces of OCS in a methanol-rich matrix. This would suggest the presence of independent grain components and in particular of a minor fraction of methanol-rich icy grain mantles in which OCS is embedded. From the strength of the absorption feature we deduce a OCS/H 20 ratio, along the line of sight, of 4 x 10 (exp - 4) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the diurnal variations of atmospheric <b>carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> (COS) during 2011 at Gif-sur-Yvette, a suburban atmospheric measurement site in France. These {{data were collected}} semi-continuously in parallel with hydrogen (H 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and 222 Radon (222 Rn) measurements. Fluxes and deposition velocities were calculated for nocturnal situations of low boundary layer height using the Radon-Tracer Method. Contrary to CO and H 2, the diurnal cycles of COS are not impacted by emissions from nearby automobile traffic. In the absence of local anthropogenic combustion sources, COS and H 2 mole fractions generally show similar temporal variations with night-time depletion coinciding with 222 Rn accumulation during stable nocturnal conditions. Nocturnal COS deposition velocities range from 0. 07 to 0. 40 &#x 2009;mm s&#x 2212; 1, with an annual mean of 0. 18 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 12 &#x 2009;mm s&#x 2212; 1 (n= 14). We found strong similarities between COS and H 2 dry deposition velocities in terms of annual mean and ranges of variation, and data showed linear correlation between the two. This study provides new evidence {{of the loss of}} COS near the ground via non-photosynthetic processes. Although the dominant sink of atmospheric H 2 is diffusion and subsequent destruction in soils, it is not all certain that COS is taken up at night solely by soils...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} the first {{investigation}} of biodegradation of carbon disulphide (CS 2) in soil that provides estimates of degradation rates and identifies intermediate degradation products and carbon isotope signatures of degradation. Microcosm studies were undertaken under anaerobic conditions using soil and groundwater recovered from CS 2 -contaminated sites. Proposed degradation mechanisms were validated using equilibrium speciation modelling of concentrations and carbon isotope ratios. A first-order degradation rate constant of 1. 25 × 10 - 2 h- 1 was obtained for biological degradation with soil. <b>Carbonyl</b> <b>sulphide</b> (COS) and hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) {{were found to be}} intermediates of degradation, but did not accumulate in vials. A 13 C/ 12 C enrichment factor of - 7. 5 ± 0. 8 ‰ was obtained for degradation within microcosms with both soil and groundwater whereas a 13 C/ 12 C enrichment factor of - 23. 0 ± 2. 1 ‰ was obtained for degradation with site groundwater alone. It can be concluded that biological degradation of both CS 2 -contaminated soil and groundwater is likely to occur in the field suggesting that natural attenuation may be an appropriate remedial tool at some sites. The presence of biodegradation by-products including COS and H 2 S indicates that biodegradation of CS 2 is occurring and stable carbon isotopes are a promising tool to quantify CS 2 degradation...|$|E
