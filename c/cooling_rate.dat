5|$|In GMAW {{the primary}} cause of {{porosity}} is gas entrapment in the weld pool, which occurs when the metal solidifies before the gas escapes. The gas can come from impurities in the shielding gas or on the workpiece, as well as from an excessively long or violent arc. Generally, the amount of gas entrapped {{is directly related to the}} <b>cooling</b> <b>rate</b> of the weld pool. Because of its higher thermal conductivity, aluminum welds are especially susceptible to greater cooling rates and thus additional porosity. To reduce it, the workpiece and electrode should be clean, the welding speed diminished and the current set high enough to provide sufficient heat input and stable metal transfer but low enough that the arc remains steady. Preheating can also help reduce the <b>cooling</b> <b>rate</b> in some cases by reducing the temperature gradient between the weld area and the base material.|$|E
5|$|Thermotropic mesophases are {{detected}} and {{characterized by}} two major methods, the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy, {{in which a}} small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers; the sample was then heated and cooled. As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or <b>cooling</b> <b>rate</b> will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.|$|E

The constructed cooling rig produced different <b>cooling</b> <b>rates</b> with reliable repeatability as intended. <b>Cooling</b> <b>rates</b> between 130 ̊C/s and 20 ̊C/s were accomplished. Mg 2 Si occurred in all investigated test samples with various amounts.

25|$|The corium {{undergoes}} degradation. The Elephant's Foot, {{hard and}} strong shortly after its formation, is now cracked enough that a glue-treated wad easily separated its top 1–2 centimeter layer. The structure's shape itself is changed as the material slides down and settles. The corium temperature is now just slightly different from ambient, {{the material is}} therefore subject to both day-night temperature cycling and weathering by water. The heterogeneous nature of corium and different thermal expansion coefficients of the components causes material deterioration with thermal cycling. Large amounts of residual stresses were introduced during solidification due to the uncontrolled <b>cooling</b> <b>rate.</b> The water, seeping into pores and microcracks and freezing there, the same process that creates potholes on roads, accelerates cracking.|$|E
25|$|The {{crystallisation}} of {{igneous rocks}} from magma {{depends on a}} number of factors; among them are the chemical composition of the magma, the <b>cooling</b> <b>rate,</b> and some properties of the individual minerals to be formed, such as lattice energy, melting point, and complexity of their crystal structure. As magma is cooled, olivine appears first, followed by pyroxene, amphibole, biotite mica, orthoclase feldspar, muscovite mica, quartz, zeolites, and finally hydrothermal minerals. This sequence shows a trend towards increasingly complex silicate units with cooling, and the introduction of hydroxide and fluoride anions in addition to oxides. Many metals can substitute for silicon. After these igneous rocks undergo weathering, transport, and deposition, sedimentary rocks like clay, shale, and sandstone are formed. Metamorphism also can occur at high temperatures and pressures, creating an even vaster variety of minerals.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{of cooling}} {{has been shown to}} {{influence}} the frost resistance of tissues, but the actual rate of freezing will depend not only on the <b>cooling</b> <b>rate,</b> but also on the degree of supercooling and the properties of the tissue. Sakai (1979a) demonstrated ice segregation in shoot primordia of Alaskan white and black spruces when cooled slowly to 30nbsp&°C to -40nbsp&°C. These freeze-dehydrated buds survived immersion in liquid nitrogen when slowly rewarmed. Floral primordia responded similarly. Extraorgan freezing in the primordia accounts for the ability of the hardiest of the boreal conifers to survive winters in regions when air temperatures often fall to -50nbsp&°C or lower. The hardiness of the winter buds of such conifers is enhanced by the smallness of the buds, by the evolution of faster translocation of water, and an ability to tolerate intensive freeze dehydration. In boreal species of Picea and Pinus, the frost resistance of 1-year-old seedlings is on a par with mature plants, given similar states of dormancy.|$|E
40|$|There is long {{standing}} problem reconciling the chemical {{evidence that the}} IVA iron meteorites formed in a core with the diverse <b>cooling</b> <b>rates</b> reported by several researchers. This large inferred range of <b>cooling</b> <b>rates</b> suggests that the IVA irons were distributed at different depths in a parent body with a complex structure when the Widmanstatten pattern formed. On the other hand, some researchers argued that the diverse <b>cooling</b> <b>rates</b> in group IVA result from inaccurate model parameters such as phase diagram, interdiffusion coefficients, and kamacite nucleation and growth mechanisms. In addition, the measured <b>cooling</b> <b>rates</b> may not apply for the same cooling temperature ranges, and the variation in the crystallographic orientations of the Widmanstatten plates on the analysis surface may result in inaccurate measurements of widths needed for the computer simulation models. We have revaluated the major parameters in computer model developed by Hopfe and Goldstein and measured <b>cooling</b> <b>rates</b> for the IVA irons.

40|$|We {{study the}} thermal {{evolution}} of primordial star-forming gas clouds using three-dimensional cosmological simulations. We critically examine how assumptions and approximations made in calculating radiative <b>cooling</b> <b>rates</b> affect {{the dynamics of}} the collapsing gas clouds. We consider two important molecular hydrogen cooling processes that operate in a dense primordial gas; H_ 2 line cooling and continuum cooling by H_ 2 collision-induced emission. To calculate the optically thick <b>cooling</b> <b>rates,</b> we follow the Sobolev method for the former, whereas we perform ray-tracing for the latter. We also run the same set of simulations using simplified fitting functions for the net <b>cooling</b> <b>rates.</b> We compare the simulation results in detail.

500|$|The {{heat-affected zone}} (HAZ) is a ring {{surrounding}} the weld {{in which the}} temperature of the welding process, combined with the stresses of uneven heating and cooling, alter the heat-treatment properties of the alloy. The effects of welding on the material surrounding the weld can be detrimental—depending on the materials used and the heat input of the welding process used, the HAZ can be of varying size and strength. The thermal diffusivity of the base material plays a large role—if the diffusivity is high, the material <b>cooling</b> <b>rate</b> is high and the HAZ is relatively small. Conversely, a low diffusivity leads to slower cooling and a larger HAZ. The amount of heat injected by the welding process plays an important role as well, as processes like oxyacetylene welding have an unconcentrated heat input and increase the size of the HAZ. Processes like laser beam welding give a highly concentrated, limited amount of heat, resulting in a small HAZ. Arc welding falls between these two extremes, with the individual processes varying somewhat in heat input. To calculate the heat input for arc welding procedures, the following formula can be used: ...|$|E

40|$|Radiative cooling {{is central}} {{to a wide range}} of astrophysical problems. Despite its importance, <b>cooling</b> <b>rates</b> are {{generally}} computed using very restrictive assumptions, such as collisional ionization equilibrium and solar relative abundances. We simultaneously relax both assumptions and investigate the effects of photo-ionization of heavy elements by the meta-galactic UV/X-ray background and of variations in relative abundances on the <b>cooling</b> <b>rates</b> of optically thin gas in ionization equilibrium. We find that photo-ionization by the meta-galactic background radiation reduces the net <b>cooling</b> <b>rates</b> by up to an order of magnitude for gas densities and temperatures typical of the shock-heated intergalactic medium and proto-galaxies. In addition, photo-ionization changes the relative contributions of different elements to the <b>cooling</b> <b>rates.</b> We conclude that photo-ionization by the ionizing background and heavy elements both need to be taken into account in order for the <b>cooling</b> <b>rates</b> to be correct to order of magnitude.

These data have been taken {{over a period of}} 7 years by the SABER instrument on the NASA TIMED satellite and are the dominant radiative cooling mechanisms for the thermosphere. From the SABER observations we derive vertical profiles of radiative <b>cooling</b> <b>rates</b> (W/cu m), radiative fluxes (W/sq m), and radiated power (W). In the period from January 2002 through January 2009 we observe a large decrease in the <b>cooling</b> <b>rates,</b> fluxes, and power consistent with the declining phase of solar cycle. The power radiated by NO during 2008 when the Sun exhibited few sunspots was nearly one order of magnitude smaller than the peak power observed shortly after the mission began.

40|$|<b>Cooling</b> <b>rates</b> {{based on}} the {{retrograde}} diffusion of Fe 2 + and Mg between garnet and biotite inclusions commonly show two contrasting scenarios: a) narrow closure temperature range with apparent absence of retrograde diffusion; or b) high result dispersion due to compositional variations in garnet and biotite. <b>Cooling</b> <b>rates</b> from migmatites, felsic and mafic granulites from Ribeira Fold Belt (SE Brazil) also show these two scenarios. Although the former {{can be explained by}} very fast cooling, the latter is often the result of open-system behaviour caused by deformation. Retrogressive cooling during the exhumation of granulite-facies rocks is often processed by thrusting and shearing which may cause plastic deformation, fractures and cracks in the garnet megablasts, allowing chemical diffusion outside the garnet megablast – biotite inclusion system. However, a careful use of garnets and biotites with large Fe/Mg variation and software that reduces result dispersion provides a good correlation between closure temperatures and the size of biotite inclusions which are mostly due to diffusion and compositional readjustment to thermal evolution during retrogression. Results show that felsic and mafic granulites have low <b>cooling</b> <b>rates</b> (1 – 2 °C/Ma) at higher temperatures and high <b>cooling</b> <b>rates</b> (~ 100 °C/Ma) at lower temperatures, suggesting a two-step cooling/exhumation process, whereas migmatites show a small decrease in <b>cooling</b> <b>rates</b> during <b>cooling</b> (from 2. 0 to 0. 5 °C/Ma).
