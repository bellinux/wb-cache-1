5|$|The {{levelized cost}} of {{electricity}} (LCoE) can be calculated by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power-generating system over its lifetime by {{the total amount of}} electricity shipped to the grid during that period. The amount of money is essentially a combination of the capital expense (CAPEX) of the plant and the interest payments on that CAPEX, and the discounted cost of the fuel, the maintenance needed to keep it running and its dismantling, the discounted operational expenses, or OPEX. The amount of power is normally calculated by considering the peak power the plant could produce, and then adjusting that by the capacity factor (CF) to account for downtime due to maintenance or deliberate throttling. As a quick calculation, one <b>can</b> <b>ignore</b> inflation, opportunity costs and minor operational expenses to develop a figure of merit for the {{cost of electricity}}.|$|E

25|$|The {{negative}} sign is {{in there}} because we {{are concerned with the}} faster moving liquid (top in figure), which is being slowed by the slower liquid (bottom in figure). By Newton's third law of motion, the force on the slower liquid is equal and opposite (no negative sign) to the force on the faster liquid. This equation assumes that the area of contact is so large that we <b>can</b> <b>ignore</b> any effects from the edges and that the fluids behave as Newtonian fluids.|$|E
500|$|More {{commonly}} Black {{prefers to}} rule out White's queen check with 7...a6, which incidentally threatens to expand on the queenside. White <b>can</b> <b>ignore</b> this with 8.e4 b5 9.Qe2, aiming to quickly overrun Black in the centre with the e4-e5 advance. However, 8.a4 Bg7 {{is the most popular}} continuation, when White can aim for a transposition to the Classical Main Line with 9.e4. Another possibility is 9.h3 0-0 10.e3, which gives the bishop a retreat square in case of ...Nh5 and delays further expansion in the centre until the White's development is complete. Although a number of opening books recommended the 7.Bf4 variation for White in the early 21st century, Black appears to be able to maintain the balance in this line.|$|E

2500|$|In the Gorgias, Plato {{distinguishes between}} {{philosophy}} and rhetoric, characterizing Gorgias as an orator who entertains his audience with his eloquent words and {{who believes that}} it is unnecessary to learn the truth about actual matters when one has discovered the art of persuasion (Consigny 36). [...] In the dialogue, Gorgias responds to one of Socrates’ statements as follows: [...] "Rhetoric is the only area of expertise you need to learn.

2500|$|The {{lifestyle}} led by undercover agents is {{very different}} compared to other areas in law enforcement, {{and it can be}} quite difficult to reintegrate back into normal duties.

[...] They may feel uncomfortable, and take a cynical, suspicious or even paranoid world view and feel continually on guard.|$|E
2500|$|One {{response}} to the problem is to accept its demands. This is the view taken by Peter Singer, who says: [...] "No doubt we do instinctively prefer {{to help those who}} are close to us.
