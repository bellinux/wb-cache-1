On 5 November 2017, Topolánek confirmed his candidacy. He stated that he wants support of Senators from all parties. Some politicians of the <b>Civic</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> support for his candidacy. Leader of ANO 2011 Andrej Babiš attacked Topolánek and called him the most corrupt Czech Prime Minister. Topolánek's candidacy was also criticised by Jiří Drahoš. He stated that Topolánek represents the same thing as Miloš Zeman - rudeness and lack of respect for his opponents. He called Topolánek's candidacy a bad joke. On 6 November 2017, Topolánek gathered enough signatures to run.

25|$|According to {{calculations}} by Vote Watch Europe, the ECR {{group had}} a cohesion rate of 86.65% in parliamentary votes during the 7th session (2009–14). This is slightly lower than in the four pro-European groups, but {{higher than in the}} European United Left–Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) and far higher than in the Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD) groups. Internal cohesion was highest in votes on constitutional and inter-institutional affairs (94.79%), international trade, and industry, research & energy. The greatest divergence within the group was in decisions on regional development (70.53% cohesion), agriculture, and development (cooperation). The parties that were most loyal to the group (meaning that they voted with the majority of ECR members the most often) were the UK Conservatives (97.51%), the Ulster Unionist Party and the Czech <b>Civic</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b> The members who deviated from the ECR majority the most often were the individual MEPs Andreasen from the UK (who had switched over from EFD group only in 2013; 61.20% loyalty), Muscardini from Italy, and Rosbach (who had crossed over from EFD in 2011).|$|E

2500|$|Following the 2003 and 2008 elections, {{which both}} {{required}} multiple ballots, {{some in the}} Czech political community expressed dissatisfaction with this method of election. In 2008, Martin Bursík, leader of the Czech Green Party, said of the 2008 vote, [...] "We are sitting {{here in front of}} the public somewhat muddied by backstage horse-trading, poorly concealed meetings with lobbyists and intrigue." [...] There were calls to adopt a system with a direct election, in which the public would be involved in the voting. However, opponents of this plan pointed out that the presidency had always been determined by indirect vote, going back through several predecessor states to the presidency of Tomáš Masaryk. Charles University political scientist Zdeněk Zbořil suggested that direct voting could result in a president and prime minister who were hostile to each other's goals, leading to deadlock. A system of direct elections was supported by figures including Jiří Čunek (Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party) and Jiří Paroubek (Czech Social Democratic Party), whereas the ruling <b>Civic</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> under both President Václav Klaus and Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, was more skeptical. Topolánek commented that it was an advantage that [...] "our presidential elections are not preceded by some campaign, that is unavoidable in a direct election and causes rifts among citizens". Using Poland as an unfavourable example, he said that [...] "when someone talks about how our method of selecting the head of state is undignified, he should first weigh the consequences of a direct vote".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{attitudes towards}} immigration and multiculturalism in two autonomist parties, the Scottish National Party and the Frisian National Party. Both parties {{are members of}} the European Free Alliance, ‘an alliance of regionalist and <b>civic,</b> <b>democratic</b> nationalist <b>parties</b> in Europe’ (EFA website). However, the parties highlight the broad diversity of ‘civic’ autonomist parties; the SNP being a large governing party which utilizes an economic narrative to further its autonomist agenda whereas the FNP is a provincial party in the Netherlands with a strong cultural focus. Both parties have had to formulate policies and create a narrative in relation to immigration. This paper compares attitudes to immigration and multiculturalism in both parties by examining different conceptions of national identity. A mixed methods approach is adopted, including quantitative analysis of surveys of both parties’ memberships and semi- structured interviews with party elites as well as documentary analysis. It is demonstrated that contextual factors such as immigration pressures, demographic challenges and peripherality help to explain the parties’ official positions. These are, in general, positive towards immigration and multiculturalism. However, at an individual level there is considerable divergence between members in terms of attitudes towards immigration and multiculturalism...|$|R
40|$|The civic versus ethnocultural dichotomy, used to {{distinguish}} between different types of nations and national identities, is in this thesis tested on two autonomist parties: the Scottish National Party (SNP) and Friesian National Party (FNP). Both parties {{are members of the}} European Free Alliance, ‘an alliance of regionalist and <b>civic,</b> <b>democratic</b> nationalist <b>parties</b> in Europe’ (EFA website). Each party’s position on issues pertinent to the dichotomy – European integration, immigration and multiculturalism – is analysed in order to test the value of the civic-ethnocultural dichotomy. A mixed methods approach is adopted, including quantitative analysis of surveys of both parties’ memberships and semi-structured interviews with party elites as well as documentary analysis. The conclusion is that a civic-ethnocultural framework is useful for analysing such parties but that it is conceptually unhelpful if conceived as a dichotomy and has greater value if understood in a more nuanced way. Instead, the framework can be conceptualised as multiple non-competitive continua with different dimensions that are related and whose association with the issues of European integration, immigration and multiculturalism is similar in direction, but diverges in strength.
