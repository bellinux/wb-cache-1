These projects opened to these youth, training opportunities and enabled the majority of them to qualify for jobs heretofore closed to them." [...] Within the administration, Bethune advocated for the appointment of black NYA officials to positions of political power. Bethune’s administrative assistants served as liaisons between the National Division of Negro Affairs and the NYA agencies on the state and local levels. The high number of administrative assistants composed a work force commanded by Bethune. They helped gain better job and salary opportunities for blacks across the country. During her tenure, Bethune also pushed federal officials to approve a program of <b>consumer</b> <b>education</b> for blacks, and a foundation for black crippled children. She planned for studies for black workers’ education councils. National officials did not support these due to inadequate funding and fear of duplicating the work of private non-governmental agencies. The NYA was terminated in 1943.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{facilitate}} informed decision-making in the development of a curriculum guide for Massachusetts family and <b>consumer</b> sciences <b>education</b> programs by gathering new knowledge related to the National Standards for Family and <b>Consumer</b> Sciences <b>Education</b> (National Association of State Administrators of Family and <b>Consumer</b> Sciences·Vocational-Technical <b>Education</b> Consortium of States [NASAFACS·V-TECS], 1998). The three goals of this study were: (1) to determine the perceived importance of each of the 16 areas of study of the National Standards for Family and <b>Consumer</b> Sciences <b>Education</b> (NASAFACS·V-TECS, 1998) in meeting the national family and <b>consumer</b> sciences <b>education</b> vision, (2) to determine the perceived importance of each of the 86 content standards of the National Standards for Family and <b>Consumer</b> Sciences <b>Education</b> (NASAFACS·V-TECS, 1998) in meeting the national family and <b>consumer</b> sciences <b>education</b> vision, and (3) to determine how often each content standard is taught in local family and <b>consumer</b> sciences <b>education</b> programs in Massachusetts. The national vision states that: “Family and <b>Consumer</b> Sciences <b>Education</b> empowers individuals and families across the life span to manage the challenges of living in a diverse global society. Our unique focus is on families, work, and their interrelationships” (NASAFACS·V-TECS, 1998, p. 2). ^ The descriptive survey involved data collection from a national population of head state administrators of family and consumer sciences and the population of Massachusetts family and <b>consumer</b> sciences <b>education</b> professionals. The study found that whereas the question asked respondents to identify six areas of study, the results indicated that seven areas of study were perceived as distinctly more important. Six of the seven family and <b>consumer</b> sciences <b>education</b> areas of study were selected as more important by both the head state administrators and the Massachusetts professionals. These areas of study were: parenting; interpersonal relations; human development; family; career, community, and family connections; and nutrition and wellness. The Massachusetts professionals included the early childhood, education, and services as one of the seven more important areas of study, whereas the head state administrators selected the consumer and family resources as one of the seven more important areas of study. ...|$|R

2500|$|A related {{contemporary}} ideology, consumerism, {{which encourages}} the personal acquisition {{of goods and}} services, also drives globalization. [...] Anti-consumerism is a social movement against equating personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. Concern over the treatment of consumers by large corporations has spawned substantial activism, and the incorporation of <b>consumer</b> <b>education</b> into school curricula. Social activists hold materialism is connected to global retail merchandizing and supplier convergence, war, greed, anomie, crime, environmental degradation, and general social malaise and discontent. One variation on this topic is activism by postconsumers, with the strategic emphasis on moving beyond addictive consumerism.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{generally}} settled in case law that jurisdictions in the United States and Canada {{have the right}} to enact breed-specific legislation; however, the appropriateness and effectiveness of breed-specific legislation in preventing dog bite fatalities and injuries is disputed. One point of view is that certain dog breeds are a public safety issue that merits actions such as banning ownership, mandatory spay/neuter for all dogs of these breeds, mandatory microchip implants and liability insurance, or prohibiting people convicted of a felony from owning them. Another point of view is that comprehensive [...] "dog bite" [...] legislation, coupled with better <b>consumer</b> <b>education</b> and legally mandating responsible pet keeping practices, is a better solution than breed-specific legislation to the problem of dangerous dogs. A third point of view is that breed-specific legislation should not ban breeds entirely, but should strictly regulate the conditions under which specific breeds could be owned, e.g., forbidding certain classes of individuals from owning them, specifying public areas in which they would be prohibited, and establishing conditions, such as requiring a dog to wear a muzzle, for taking dogs from specific breeds into public places. Finally, some governments, such as that of Australia, have forbidden the import of specific breeds and are requiring the spay/neuter of all existing dogs of these breeds in an attempt to eliminate the population slowly through natural attrition.|$|E

[...] Its objectives are: [...] 1. to identify the at-risk youth’s individual strengths and weaknesses, 2. to provide an individualized environment in which the at-risk youth can develop skills, and 3. to alter the natural environment of the at-risk youth so that new acquired skills are nurtured and encouraged. [...] To achieve these objectives, C.I.T.Y. offers academic remediation in reading, math, language; intensive counseling that involves behavior modification, <b>consumer</b> <b>education,</b> and job readiness training. [...] After all objectives have been met, C.I.T.Y. provides GED preparation, return to public school, and placement into technical school, college, job, or military service. [...] In 1983, C.I.T.Y. Program of Etowah County (Gadsden) received the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges Unique and Innovative Project Award.
