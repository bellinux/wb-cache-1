50|$|The Service was a complaints-handling body, quasi-independent of the Society. It {{was part}} of the Law Society, but {{operated}} independently. The services offered to consumers were confidential and free at the point of use, the profession having rejected the idea of charging a flat fee as do some other professional complaints services, for example that of architects. Where a complaint was upheld the firm complained of may have been required to make a <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> incurred by the Service in dealing with the complaint. Each case was said to have been looked at impartially, the Service working to find a solution acceptable to everyone concerned, including the lawyer.|$|E
5000|$|Mary F. Young, {{historian}} of the Woman’s Club, reported in 1932 that “the club accepted the responsibility and expense of remodeling the Miller building which the City Commissioners have dedicated as a Public Library” and that the collection now included over 2,000 books. [...] The building, an “old run-down tax-foreclosed residence”, was located at 501 North Wheeler Street. The building was on {{the northwest corner of}} Wheeler and McLendon, which is where the current library stands with a south-facing entrance on McLendon. The Woman’s Club continued to operate the library there, and in 1940 the city began to provide a $25 per month <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of running the library. By 1941, the library owned 9,605 books and used funds from the Works Progress Administration to pay two clerks.|$|E
30|$|In 1986, a {{new policy}} was proposed, which came {{accompanied}} by a simple slogan to remind the public of its objectives, “to establish at least one public kindergarten in each township, and one public nursery center within each village”. The government funding support was resumed {{with the implementation of}} this project. However, public kindergartens and nursery centers at this time were not free of charge; parents had to pay a flat rate stipulated by city or county administrations, usually a partial <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs.</b> In this context, public investment includes the provision of sites; facilities and subsidies (share balances).|$|E

30|$|With these {{legislative}} interventions {{the public}} authority {{has tried to}} accomplish the European laws’ directive in this particular field. The support mechanism that has been introduced consists in a <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> for the upgrades carried out to improve energy efficiency, based on both the type of intervention {{and the increase in}} efficiency/production of the plant/building. This new mechanism encompasses a various number of scenarios, from the intervention on building envelopes to the upgrade, replacement and new installation of RES plants, and is in conflict with other available fiscal support by the public authorities. For this reason, it has not been requested intensively.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{economic}} impact assessment of six major sports events held in the UK in 1997. Major sports events are now regarded by many cities as a significant part of their tourism strategy. However, staging a major sports event normally involves the host city making a <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs.</b> Whether such a contribution is justified depends on the economic benefits generated in the local economy. The results reported in this paper indicate the wide variability in such benefits as well as the difficulty sometimes encountered in predicting what these benefits will be prior to the staging of the event. An attempt is made to develop a typology of major sports events in terms of their potential to generate significant economic impact...|$|E
40|$|The {{case law}} is unequivocal in {{considering}} the contribution of urbanization as a compensation of public law, of non-tax nature, imposed to the constructor as a <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of urbanization in proportion {{to all of the}} benefits that the new building will take, so that the use provides the legal basis for the of “an debeatur”, while the modes of the use provides the legal basis of the “quantum”. Consequently, {{there is no reason to}} exclude the substraction from the sums due in respect of infrastructure costs of the works carried out directly by the dealer, also when the request refers to the subtraction of the value that corresponds to the primary infrastructure works from the amount that have to be paid in respect of charges of secondary infrastructure, given the common legal nature of the charges in question...|$|E
40|$|Pauli thanks Bohr for {{his letter}} of the 7 th August and he is glad to inform him that they got a stipend of 3000 Swiss francs for Alder as a <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> for his stay in Copenhagen. Pauli hopes that Bohr can get an {{additional}} contribution which will enable {{him to be in}} Copenhagen for 6 months starting about October the first. Pauli has had interesting ongoing discussions with Møller-Kristensen and with Peierls on the formfactor theories. Like Bohr, Pauli thinks it unlikely that they will make real progress this way, but it seems to Pauli to be of interest to learn a little more about where formally the limitations of these models become obvious. Pauli received from Schrödinger the proofs of a paper (British Journal of Philosophy of Science) of which Pauli was unable to make any sense. It is in a way even more empty than Bohm's attempts to resume de Broglies old wave theory...|$|E
