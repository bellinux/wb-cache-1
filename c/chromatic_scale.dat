5|$|In major-thirds tuning, the <b>chromatic</b> <b>scale</b> is {{arranged}} on three consecutive strings in four consecutive frets. This four-fret arrangement facilitates the left-hand technique for classical (Spanish) guitar: For each hand position of four frets, the hand is stationary and the fingers move, each finger {{being responsible for}} one fret. Consequently, three hand-positions (covering frets 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12) partition the fingerboard of classical guitar, which has exactly 12 frets.|$|E
5|$|The orchestral exposition, 99 {{measures}} long, presents {{two groups}} of thematic material, one primary and one secondary, both in the tonic of C minor. The orchestra opens the principal theme in unison, but not powerfully: the dynamic marking is piano. The theme is tonally ambiguous, not asserting the home key of C minor until its final cadence in the thirteenth measure. It is also highly chromatic: in its 13 measures it utilises all 12 notes of the <b>chromatic</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Five Songs (1956–57) and Musique funèbre (1958) Lutosławski {{introduced}} his {{own brand of}} twelve-tone music, marking his departure from the explicit use of folk music. His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build harmony and melody from specific intervals (in Musique funèbre, augmented fourths and semitones). This system also gave him the means to write dense chords without resorting to tone clusters, and enabled him to build towards these dense chords (which often include all twelve notes of the <b>chromatic</b> <b>scale)</b> at climactic moments. Lutosławski's twelve-note techniques were thus completely different in conception from Arnold Schoenberg's tone-row system, although Musique funèbre does happen {{to be based on}} a tone row. This twelve-note intervallic technique had its genesis in earlier works such as Symphony No. 1, and Paganini Variations.|$|E

5|$|The body of {{a modern}} soprano {{clarinet}} is equipped with numerous tone holes of which seven (six front, one back) are covered with the fingertips, and the rest are opened or closed using a set of keys. These tone holes let the player produce every note of the <b>chromatic</b> <b>scale.</b> On alto and larger clarinets, and a few soprano clarinets, key-covered holes replace some or all finger holes. The most common system of keys was named the Boehm system by its designer Hyacinthe Klosé in honour of flute designer Theobald Boehm, {{but it is not}} the same as the Boehm system used on flutes. The other main system of keys is called the Oehler system and is used mostly in Germany and Austria (see History). The related Albert system is used by some jazz, klezmer, and eastern European folk musicians. The Albert and Oehler systems are both based on the early Mueller system.|$|E

25|$|In music theory, {{the circle}} of fifths (or circle of fourths) is the {{relationship}} among the 12 tones of the <b>chromatic</b> <b>scale,</b> their corresponding key signatures, and the associated major and minor keys.

25|$|A second {{direction}} {{in the search for}} a new tonality was twelve-tone serialism. Arnold Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone method of composition {{as an alternative to the}} structure provided by the diatonic system.

50|$|A {{monotonic}} {{scale is}} a musical scale consisting {{of only one}} note in the octave.

25|$|Schoenberg {{was known}} {{early in his}} career for {{simultaneously}} extending the traditionally opposed German Romantic styles of Brahms and Wagner. Later, his name would come to personify innovations in atonality (although Schoenberg himself detested that term) that would become the most polemical feature of 20th-century art music. In the 1920s, Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone technique, an influential compositional method of manipulating an ordered series of all twelve notes in the <b>chromatic</b> <b>scale.</b> He also coined the term developing variation and was the first modern composer to embrace ways of developing motifs without resorting to the dominance of a centralized melodic idea.|$|E
25|$|The lülü {{formed the}} ritual scale to which many {{instruments}} were tuned. The {{name of the}} lowest sound, huangzhong also implyed 'musical correctness.' Its pitch formed a pitch standard, setting the base pitch of zithers, flutes and singers of imperial court orchestras. Straight-walled pitch pipes without finger holes were made of cast metal, their lengths specified by court regulations. The resulting <b>chromatic</b> <b>scale</b> provided twelve fundamental notes {{for the construction of}} the musical scales themselves. The lülü also has a cosmological value: its notes describe the energetic frequency of the twelve months of the year, the daily rhythm of the twelve bi-hours of the Chinese clock, the twelve main acupuncture meridians, etc.|$|E

25|$|Standard tuning {{provides}} reasonably simple fingering (left hand movement) {{for playing}} standard scales and basic chords in all {{major and minor}} keys. The separation of the first (high E) and second (B) string, {{as well as the}} separation between the third (G), fourth (D), fifth (A), and sixth (low E) strings by a five-semitone interval (a perfect fourth) allows notes of the <b>chromatic</b> <b>scale</b> to be played with each of the four fingers of the left hand controlling one of the first four frets (index finger on fret 1, little finger on fret 4, etc.) only when the hand is in the first position; otherwise, the four fingers must stretch to cover five frets.|$|E
25|$|The Hampartsoum {{notation}} uses symbols {{derived from}} an older notation called խազ khaz {{used by the}} Armenian Church. Pitch is indicated by one of forty-five symbols. There are fourteen notes per octave over a range of three octaves and a minor second; a tilde is used {{in place of a}} sharp and also to raise or lower a note an octave. All twelve notes of the Western <b>chromatic</b> <b>scale</b> are represented, {{but in the case of}} F-sharp (fa diyez in Turkish) and B-natural (si), two enharmonic symbols are used for each, because Middle Eastern music uses microtonal intervals called commas. Above each note is written another symbol, marking its duration. Other symbols are used for rests, repeats and phrases.|$|E
25|$|Quite at the {{opposite}} end of the spectrum, in terms of the complexity of the key system developed by Boehm, was the Giorgi flute, an advanced form of the ancient holed flute. Patented in 1897, the Giorgi flute was designed without any mechanical keys, though the patent allows for the addition of keys as options. Giorgi enabled the performer to play equally true in all musical keys, as does the Boehm system. Giorgi flutes are now rarities, found in museums and private collections. The underlying principles of both flute patterns are virtually identical, with tone holes spaced as required to produce a fully <b>chromatic</b> <b>scale.</b> The player, by opening and closing holes, adjusts the effective length of the tube, and thus the rate of oscillation, which defines the audible pitch.|$|E
5000|$|Typically the {{original}} Gospel Song was composed using a dotted notes {{in an even}} measure, creating a swing rhythm. Harmonically often just the three main functions of a major scale were used. Melodically the Gospel Song restrained itself to triads, pentatonic <b>scales</b> and occasionally <b>chromatic</b> <b>scales.</b> Its verses are generated by repetition, sequences and inversion {{of just a few}} motives. Most of the songs feature a refrain.|$|R
25|$|These terms {{can become}} {{ambiguous}} {{when dealing with}} non-diatonic scales, such as the pentatonic or <b>chromatic</b> <b>scales.</b> The use of accidentals can also complicate the terminology. For example, the chord B–E–A appears to be quartal, {{as a series of}} diminished fourths (B–E and E–A), but it is enharmonically equivalent to (and sonically indistinguishable from) the tertian chord C–E–G, which is a series of major thirds (C–E and E–G).|$|R
50|$|A {{development}} of the tempestoso theme, the tremolo figure {{is similar to that}} in the middle section of the L'enfer movement in Alkan's Grand Duo Concertante.

Meanwhile, the bass tremolo is punctuated by fortissimo octave statements in the lower bass.|$|R
