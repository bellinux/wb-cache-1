25|$|Australia's {{major roads}} are {{managed by the}} states and territories. While some state road {{authorities}} use a road hierarchy with Highway as the highest classification, the classification of state-controlled roads varies between states, with differing classification names, definitions, and number of levels in the hierarchy. Road names do not necessarily correspond to classifications – for example, Great Southern Highway is not classified as a highway. A highway, or other <b>classification</b> <b>level,</b> may be composed of multiple named roads, and a single road name may have varying classifications along its length. Internal numbering schemes for such classifications do not necessarily relate to designated road routes – for example, Great Western Highway is Highway 5 for administrative purposes but is signposted as part of route A32.|$|E

50|$|For most {{patients}} with ASIA A (complete) tetraplegia, ASIA B (incomplete) tetraplegia and ASIA C (incomplete) tetraplegia, the International <b>Classification</b> <b>level</b> {{of the patient}} can be established without great difficulty. The surgical procedures according to the International <b>Classification</b> <b>level</b> can be performed. In contrast, for patients with ASIA D (incomplete) tetraplegia {{it is difficult to}} assign an International Classification other than International <b>Classification</b> <b>level</b> X (others). Therefore, it is more difficult to decide which surgical procedures should be performed. A far more personalized approach is needed for these patients. Decisions must be based more on experience than on texts or journals.|$|E

50|$|MSL {{implementations}} such {{as these}} neatly avoided the complexities of MLS but traded off technical simplicity for inefficient use of space. Because most users in classified environments also needed unclassified systems, users often had at least two computers and sometimes more (one for unclassified processing and one for each <b>classification</b> <b>level</b> processed). In addition, each computer was connected to its own LAN at the appropriate <b>classification</b> <b>level,</b> meaning that multiple dedicated cabling plants were incorporated (at considerable cost {{in terms of both}} installation and maintenance).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Department of Defense (DoD) needs {{multilevel}} secure (MLS) {{workflow management}} systems to enable globally distributed users and applications to cooperate across <b>classification</b> <b>levels</b> to achieve mission critical goals. An MLS workflow management {{system that allows}} a user to program multilevel mission logic, to securely coordinate widely distributed tasks, and to monitor {{the progress of the}} workflow across <b>classification</b> <b>levels</b> is required. In this paper, we present a roadmap for implementing MLS workflows and focus on a workflow builder that is a graphical design tool for specifying such workflows. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Multi-level {{conceptual}} modelling addresses {{the representation of}} subject domains dealing explicitly with multiple <b>classification</b> <b>levels.</b> Despite the recent advances in multi-level modelling techniques, we believe that many challenges in multi-level {{conceptual modelling}} still stem {{from the lack of}} theory that: (i) formally characterizes the nature of <b>classification</b> <b>levels,</b> and (ii) precisely defines the structural relations that may occur between elements of different <b>classification</b> <b>levels.</b> This work aims to fill this gap by proposing an axiomatic theory that can be considered a reference top-level ontology for types in multi-level conceptual modelling. The theory provides the modeller with basic concepts and patterns to articulate domains that require multiple <b>levels</b> of <b>classification</b> as well as to inform the development of well-founded languages for multi-level conceptual modelling. The theory includes intra-level structural relations that are used to define expressive multi-level models and cross-level relations that allow us to account for and incorporate the different notions of power type in the literature. Since all the relations in the theory are ultimately explained in terms of instan-tiation between entities of adjacent levels, it is capable to harmonize power type and clabject-based approaches...|$|R
