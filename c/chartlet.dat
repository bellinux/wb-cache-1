40|$|Plymouth Sound {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} embayments on the south coast of Britain, with a water depth mostly rangmg between 12 and 6 m below chart datum. It has a mean spring and neap tidal range of 4. 7 m and 2. 2 m respectively. The Sound connects the English Channel to the Tamar and Plym {{estuaries}} to the north. The Sound is extensively used by the military, and for commercial and recreational purposes. The area is dejBned as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and a Special Protection Area (SPA). The surface water flow characteristics of the area are therefore of great interest. The study partly fulfilled its aim to "describe and explain the tidal stream behaviour found in Plymouth Sound for the purpose of surface navigation" with the successfiil completion of a tidal stream atlas. To create the tidal stream atlas drogue tracking in the Sound was carried out by the study; drogue tracking data in Plymouth Sound measured by Fugro GEOS was used as was admiralty tidal stream diamond data. All the above data was synthesised on to a 100 x 100 m grid, giving a mean flow velocity at a maximum resolution of 100 m. <b>Chartlets</b> where created at i 4 hr intervals 6 hrs either side of high water. The studies tidal stream atlas has improved on the admiralty's atlas, which is the only publicly available atlas of the area. More data was added to key navigational areas of the Sound. The extra data helped describe the flow characteristics in complex areas. There were two key findings for this study; Firstly flow characteristics are working at a smaller scale than could be seen in the admiralty's atlas. Secondly depth differentiation of surface water shows a possible riverine input effect on surface flow. Faculty of Scienc...|$|R
