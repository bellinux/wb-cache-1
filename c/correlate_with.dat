5|$|Modulation {{of neural}} {{responses}} may <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> phenomenal experiences. In {{contrast to the}} raw electrical responses that do not <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with {{an important aspect of}} consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity (brightness, contrast). In the research group of Danko Nikolić {{it has been shown that}} some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony. An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas. This indicates that, in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia—at least for some type of qualia.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurpose of {{this study}} was to examine the {{relationship}} between personality dimensions and coping styles with stress. Method was correlation study in which 300 students (150 girls, 150 boys) were selected from Malayer University. An extensive analysis was performed to assess the kind of association exist among five personality factors personality (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness) and three coping strategies (problem-focused, positive emotional-focused and negative emotional-focused). All participants were asked to complete the NEO-FFI personality inventory and the Tehran Coping Styles Scale (TCSS). Results indicated that Neuroticism was negatively <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> positive emotional-focused coping style and was positively <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> negative emotional-focused coping style in female students, while it was positively <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> negative emotional-focused coping styles in male students. Extraversion was positively <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> problem-focused and positive emotional-focused coping style in both male and female students. Openness was positively <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> problem- focused coping styles in female students. Agreeableness was positively <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> problem-focused and positive emotional- focused coping styles and negatively <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> negative emotional-focused coping style in male, while it was positively <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> problem- focused coping style and negatively <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> negative emotional-focused coping style in female students.

5|$|C. c. perplexus, {{the western}} subspecies, occurs {{from the head}} of the Great Australian Bight in South Australia westwards into Western Australia where its {{northern}} limits are Shark Bay and the mulga-eucalypt boundary line. It is less specialised in its habitat, as it does not share its distribution with the little raven, and does not appear to <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> the range of sheep. The western subspecies has a slightly lower-pitched call than that of the eastern subspecies, with similarities to calls of the little raven. Of smaller size overall, it has a more slender bill and shorter hackles. There is otherwise no difference in plumage. Intermediate birds are found in the Eyre Peninsula, Gawler Ranges and vicinity of Lake Eyre in South Australia.|$|E

5|$|Donald Canfield {{detected}} {{records of}} the first significant quantities of atmospheric oxygen just before the first Ediacaran fossils appeared– {{and the presence of}} atmospheric oxygen was soon heralded as a possible trigger for the Ediacaran radiation.

However, the assumptions underlying the reconstruction of atmospheric composition have attracted some criticism, with widespread anoxia having little effect on life where it occurs in the Early Cambrian and the Cretaceous.|$|E

Although not regarded as an anatomically modern Homo sapiens, a skull from the Central Narmada Valley in Madhya Pradesh, India, referred to as Narmada Man, is the first authenticated discovery of a late Middle Pleistocene (around 200,000 BP) hominid from South Asia. The discovery has sparked much debate regarding where it belongs in the taxonomic organisation of Pleicestone hominids. Its morphometric traits do not easily match those of Homo erectus, but they <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> hominid specimens called archaic Homo sapiens, which include pre-Neanderthals from Europe and West Asia.
