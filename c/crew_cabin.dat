5|$|Continuous US {{presence}} aboard Mir {{started in}} 1996 with the March 22 launch of Atlantis on mission STS-76, when the Second Increment astronaut Shannon Lucid {{was transferred to}} the station. STS-76 was the third docking mission to Mir, which also demonstrated logistics capabilities through deployment of a Spacehab module, and placed experiment packages aboard Mirs docking module, which marked the first spacewalk which occurred around docked vehicles. The spacewalks, carried out from Atlantis's <b>crew</b> <b>cabin,</b> provided valuable experience for astronauts in order to prepare for later assembly missions to the International Space Station.|$|E
5|$|The Lunar Module (LM) was {{designed}} to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the Command Module. Not designed to fly through the Earth's atmosphere or return to Earth, its fuselage {{was designed}} totally without aerodynamic considerations, and was of an extremely lightweight construction. It consisted of separate descent and ascent stages, {{each with its own}} engine. The descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant, surface stay consumables, and surface exploration equipment. The ascent stage contained the <b>crew</b> <b>cabin,</b> ascent propellant, and a reaction control system. The initial LM model weighed approximately , and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours. An Extended Lunar Module weighed over , and allowed surface stays of over 3 days. The contract for design and construction of the Lunar Module was awarded to Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, and the project was overseen by Thomas J. Kelly.|$|E

25|$|For the repair, the CAIB {{determined}} that the astronauts would have to use tools and small pieces of titanium, or other metal, scavenged from the <b>crew</b> <b>cabin.</b> These metals would help protect the wing structure and would be held in place during re-entry by a water-filled bag that had turned into ice in the cold of space. The ice and metal would help restore wing leading edge geometry, preventing a turbulent airflow over the wing and therefore keeping heating and burn-through levels low enough for the crew to survive re-entry and bail out before landing. The CAIB could not determine whether a patched-up left wing would have survived even a modified re-entry, {{and concluded that the}} rescue option would have had a considerably higher chance of bringing Columbias crew back alive.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, NASA {{released}} a detailed report on survivability {{aspects of the}} Columbia reentry. The crew would have had {{less than a minute}} between the beginning of orbiter disintegration and depressurization. The structural failure of the left wing set off alarms in the cabin, although they {{had no way of knowing}} that the wing had broken apart as the rear of the orbiter could not be seen from the cabin. All evidence indicated that the crew frantically tried to regain control of Columbia as it began to spin out of control, but the loss of the left wing caused the orbiter to yaw to the right, exposing its underside to extreme aerodynamic forces and causing total structural disintegration. The <b>crew</b> <b>cabin</b> separated from the rest of the orbiter and rapidly depressurized, which would have killed or incapacitated the astronauts within seconds. Afterwards, the cabin spun around at high RPM, which caused the seat restraints on their upper bodies to fail. They were thus whipped around violently and pummeled by flying and falling objects from the disintegrating cabin, along with their heads and necks being slammed against the helmets, which were not designed to provide any head protection. Even if the cabin had remained structurally intact and reached a lower altitude where air could refill it, the high altitude depressurization would have been fatal to the astronauts unless they received medical attention within 5 minutes, approximately the amount of time it would take between cerebral hypoxia and brain death.|$|E

[...] A central <b>crew</b> <b>cabin</b> was added {{in the middle of}} the keel, from which a ladder ran up through the envelope to an observation platform on top of the hull, intended for making star-sightings for navigational purposes. [...] Initially small rectangular rudders were fitted at either end of the hull: these proved inadequate to control the airship, and were removed and replaced by single rudders mounted between the tips of the biplane horizontal stabilisers at the stern. Later each of these was replaced by a pair of rudders, and large fixed fins bearing a large oval rudder fitted at the stern.|$|E
2500|$|Detailed {{engineering}} {{began in}} early 1942. A fuselage-like <b>crew</b> <b>cabin</b> {{was to be}} embedded inside the wing; it included a tail cone protruding from the trailing edge. This tail cone would contain the remote sighting stations for the bomber's gunners and a cluster of rear-firing machine guns in the production aircraft. In the midsection of the cabin, there were folding bunks for off-duty crew on long missions. The aircraft's bomb load was to be carried in six smaller bomb bays, three in each wing section, fitted with roll-away doors; this original design precluded the carrying of large bombs, and the early atomic bombs, without bomb bay redesign and modifications. Production aircraft would have defensive armament of twenty [...] machine guns or 20mm cannon, carried in six turrets, two turrets along the aircraft's center line, four {{above and below the}} outer wings, and four in the [...] "stinger" [...] tail cone. The B-35 would take advantage of a new aluminum alloy devised by Alcoa; it was considerably stronger than any alloy used previously.|$|E
