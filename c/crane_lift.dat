5000|$|Impact {{wrenches}} {{are available}} in all sizes and in several styles, depending on the application. ¼" [...] drive wrenches are commonly available in both inline (the user holds the tool like a screwdriver, with the output on the end) and pistol grip (the user holds a handle which is {{at right angles to}} the output) forms, and less commonly in an angle drive, which is similar to an inline tool but with a set of bevel gears to rotate the output 90°. ⅜" [...] impacts are most commonly available in pistol grip form and a special inline form known as a [...] "butterfly" [...] wrench, which has a large, flat throttle paddle {{on the side of the}} tool which may be tilted to one side or the other to control the direction of rotation, rather than using a separate reversing control, and shaped to allow access into tight areas. Regular inline and angle ⅜" [...] drive impact wrenches are uncommon, but available. ½" [...] drive units are virtually only available in pistol grip form, with any inline type being virtually impossible to obtain, due to the increased torque transmitted back to the user and the greater weight of the tool requiring the larger handle. ¾" [...] drive impact wrenches are again essentially only available in pistol grip form. 1" [...] drive tools {{are available in}} both pistol grip and [...] "D handle" [...] inline, where the back of the tool has an enclosed handle for the user to hold. Both forms often also incorporate a side handle, allowing both hands to hold the tool at once. 1¼" [...] and larger wrenches are usually available in [...] "T handle" [...] form, with two large handles on either side of the tool body, allowing for maximum torque to be applied to the user, and giving the best control of the tool. Very large impact wrenches (up to several hundred thousand foot-pounds of torque) usually incorporate eyelets in their design, allowing them to be suspended from a <b>crane,</b> <b>lift,</b> or other device, since their weight is often more than a person can move. A recent design combines an impact wrench and an air ratchet, often called a [...] "reactionless air ratchet" [...] by the manufacturers, incorporating an impact assembly before the ratchet assembly. Such a design allows very high output torques with minimal effort on the operator, and prevents the common injury of slamming one's knuckles into some part of the equipment when the fastener tightens down and the torque suddenly increases. Specialty designs are available for certain applications, such as removing crankshaft pulleys without removing the radiator in a vehicle.|$|E

40|$|Gantry cranes {{are widely}} used in {{industry}} for transporting heavy loads and hazardous materials in shipyards, factories, nuclear installations, and high building construction. The crane should move the load {{as fast as possible}} without causing any excessive movement at the final position. However, most of the common gantry crane results in a swing motion when payload is suddenly stopped after a fast motion. The swing motion can be reduced but will be time consuming i. e. reduce the facility availability as well as productivity. Moreover, the gantry crane needs a skilful operator to control manually based on his or her experiences to stop the swing immediately at the right position. Furthermore to unload, the operator has to wait the load stop from swinging. The failure of controlling crane also might cause accident and may harm people and surrounding. To overcome this problem, an intelligent gantry crane system had been introduced. Fuzzy logic controllers is proposed, designed and implemented for controlling payload position as well as the swing angle of the gantry crane. PID control approach will be taken as comparator based on the previous research. This project is to propose the control design of AC Servo drive system for linear guide application of gantry crane. The typical linear guide applications can be hoist system like <b>crane,</b> <b>lift,</b> gantry crane system. In this proposed control design, the main purpose of controlling gantry crane system is transporting the load as fast as possible to the required position with precision, without any force disturbance and parameter variations which is swing motion which cause a steady and/or transient error in the conventional ac servo drive system. Basically this system is designed according to the experimental results which convinced the collected data obtained, and simulation approach...|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringThis report {{presents}} {{a study of}} the structural analysis for removal operation of the Frigg TCP 2 M 32 Module with a new lifting arrangement situated {{at the top of the}} M 32 Module. During the removal of the M 32 from the Frigg TCP 2 platform performed in 2005 a planned delay to the lifting operations was required, due to installation and welding of the M 32 module lifting points at the bottom frame of the module. The intention of this study is to investigate if the interruption could have been avoided. This is done by performing structural analysis and verification of the M 32 Module and the feasibility of installing padeyes at the top of the M 32 Module. Global and local analysis covers the ultimate limit state and is carried out in accordance with prevailing design rules and standards. The global analyses are performed by using the Sesam software package and local analysis are performed by a combination of finite element analysis, analytical stress analysis and code checks. The lifting operation is defined as a heavy lift operation. Data from the Saipem S 7000 semi-submergible crane vessel is used for defining load input for lifting and transportation of the M 32 module. In this study the lifting arrangement is defined as a single <b>crane</b> <b>lift</b> with 3 loose spreader bars. The first global analysis showed failure of columns connected to the lifting points. To maintain the structural integrity of the module during lifting, these columns were reinforced by adding reinforcement plates to the failing structural elements. After that the reinforcements for the lifting operation are made the transportation condition is the governing condition for the global analysis of the M 32 module, however it does not have a significant effect on the analysis result for the transportation condition, if the padeyes are top or bottom mounted. Analysis of the padeyes was performed as an analytical stress and showed that the padeye design has the sufficient strength to carry the lifting load. The joints in the module are analyzed and found to have the required strength to withstand all forces during lifting and transport of the module. Based on the analysis and considerations performed in this report, I consider it possible to perform the lift of the M 32 module with a lifting arrangement situated at the top of the module. I consider all collected data and sources used in this thesis accurate and reliable. If errors of any kind occur I can assure that this is not of my intention as my aim is to present the results as accurate and realistic as possible. If however any inaccuracies have occurred it is my hope that these are minor and do not effect the final conclusion of this thesis...|$|E
40|$|A new {{development}} aiming {{to improve the}} safety and/or operability of offshore operations is deterministic motion forecasting. Various parties target at developing a radar which is able to detect wave trains. This deterministic wave forecast {{can be used to}} forecast vessel motions up to several minutes ahead. With such a forecast a quiescent period can be searched for, where ship motions are at a minimum. Possible advantages considered for a heavy lift operation are: Safer operations, less waiting on weather and extended lifetime of equipment. With the use of the Heerema Simulation Center (HSC), the possibilities to extend a deterministic wave forecast into a motion forecast is investigated. Thewave components are known in the HSC, so a perfect wave radar is available and the focus is entirely on (1) predicting motions and (2) presenting it in a useful way. The first part of the objective is approached by investigating the possibilities and limitations of making a motion forecast in the frequency domain. This method is convenient since the calculation is easy to understand and very fast, a quality which is most wanted when making a future prediction. To quantify the quality of a wave- andmotion forecast, the correlation coefficient (½) and RMS ratio (¾) are used (forecastedvs logged motion). The model showed good results for heave roll and pitch (½ 0. 85 - 1. 0, ¾ 0. 86 - 1. 15) for mild, severe and complex sea-states (all wave directions, respectively). For extreme swell a forecast could not be made. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that when motions become larger, a frequency domain approach is no longer valid. However, it should be noted that it is very unlikely a lift operation will take place with Hs > 2 m. The sensitivity of themodel to variations in the center of gravity and radii of gyration of the vessel (model input), is found to be within acceptable bounds. The impact is negligible on the phase and small (< 10 %) on the amplitude of the forecast. With data offshore available with an accuracy of +- 2 m, this is acceptable. Two test cases are investigated. A single <b>crane</b> <b>lift</b> (1000 mT module) and a dual crane (7000 mT module). In both cases the model proved to be well capable of forecasting themotion of interest (Heave) of the module (relative to a fixed and floating platform). The second part of the objective has a more qualitative character, where the use of a forecast is tested in the HSC by using a tool that is created for this purpose: the VirtualWave Radar Tool (VWRT). This tool is able to make and display a forecast in the HSC. The tests executed in the HSC showed positive results for the use of a forecast in the crane cabin during a lift operation. A reduction of secondary impact loads in a challenging environment was realized due to the use of the VWRT. Furthermore, a forecasted time span of two minutes (current performance of wave radars on the marked) proved to be long enough to benefit from during a lift operation. The tool demonstrated that simplicity of the dashboard is key and should be understandable at a glance. With many possible sources causing a forecast to deviate from the actual motion, a self learning, optimization model could reduce the need for exact model input offshore (not always available), even without knowing the source of deviation. vOffshore and Dredging Engineerin...|$|E
