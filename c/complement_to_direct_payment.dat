40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the tradeoffs present between equity and efficiency in farm policy. In terms of equity, {{we are concerned}} with the implications of policies on the distribution of income. For efficiency we consider how the profitability of farms is impacted by the same government policies. Specifically of interest will be the relative contributions of <b>direct</b> <b>payments,</b> commodity payments, and conservation payments to each of these measures. Results show that relative <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> commodity payments are more efficient (in terms of increasing average farm profitability) but less equitable (large farmers dominate the income gains). Conservation payments are found to be both less equitable and efficient relative <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payments.</b> We identify segmentation of the farm household population as a limitation of the analysis with respect to measuring impacts of conservation payments.

40|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>{{payments}}</b> are cash {{payments made}} to individuals eligible for social care services which {{allow them to}} manage and pay for their own social care rather than receiving it directly from their Local Authority. Research suggests that <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> can enable people with dementia {{to stay in their}} own home for longer, and experience greater choice, flexibility and an improved social life. However, uptake of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> is currently low. People living in rural communities may particularly benefit from the additional flexibility offered by direct payments; however they may face difficulties accessing appropriate services. The aim of Phase 1 of the research is to explore the reasons why people with dementia who live in rural communities do or do not gain access <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payments.</b> This will be achieved through analysis of <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> uptake data, focus groups with social workers, examination of online discussions about <b>direct</b> <b>payments,</b> and interviews with people with dementia, carers and social workers.

However uptake of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> is currently low. The first objective of this research was to explore the experiences of people with dementia living in rural communities, in relation to their access <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payments.</b> 26 semi-structured interviews were conducted with people with dementia in receipt of social care services in the community, and their carers and social workers. Focus groups were carried out with two community social work teams. <b>Direct</b> <b>payments</b> appeared <b>to</b> afford particular benefits to people with dementia and to those living in rural communities in terms of flexibility, continuity of care and access to local facilities.

40|$|Background: Increasing {{demands for}} the greater take-up of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> necessitates the {{willingness}} and ability of care co-ordinators {{to be able to}} meet this challenge. Aim: To consider how workers have responded <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> in practice and how they can enable or limit greater access. Method: The analysis presented here is primarily based on 20 in-depth interviews with care co-ordinators who took part in an evaluation of a national pilot <b>to</b> implement <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> in mental health. Results: Three key responses were identified which mediated care co-ordinators' pursuit of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> as an option for clients: using selective criteria; incorporating it into a dominant framework (of âproviding servicesâ) and re-conceptualizing their role as enabling greater capacity for choice and control. In order to make sense of these responses it was necessary to examine their conflicting work context. Conclusions: Initiatives such as <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> suggest the need to re-appraise the role of care co-ordinators and may require a significant shift in the focus of their practice. Whilst tensions inherent in their role may make this shift difficult, the analysis also suggests that it could lead to opportunities for putting into practice ideas about user empowerment which should be central to their practice...|$|R

40|$|Purpose â The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effects of {{agricultural}} policy reform â specifically the change from market <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> support â on income variability of Swiss farming households. In addition, the observed heterogeneity in income risks across farms and time is explained in terms of farm and regional characteristics. Design/methodology/approach â Unbalanced farm-level panel data of the Swiss farm accountancy network (FADN) are used to construct coefficients of variation of five-year overlapping time intervals for total household income and gross farm revenues over the period 1992 to 2009. Linear fixed effect models are applied to measure the effect of specialization, off-farm income, <b>direct</b> <b>payments,</b> farm size, and liquidity on the variability of gross farm revenues and household income in the valley, hill, and mountain regions. Findings â The switch from market-based support <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> has decreased the variability of farm revenues and household income. The strong reliance on <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> serves as insurance for most farmers and reduces both household income and revenue risk. Off-farm income can be used by farmers to reduce household income risk but it increases revenue risk in the valley regions. In all of the regions considered, farm size has a positive effect on household income risk and a negative effect on revenue risk. A high degree of specialization increases both gross revenue and household income risk. Potential revenue insurance contracts should specify farmersâ off-farm employment, the degree of specialization, farm size, and regional specific risk profiles. Originality/value â This paper assesses the complementary effects of specific farm characteristics and risk management strategies with regard to both farm revenue and household income risk. Influences of agricultural policy changes on income risks are also empirically assessed at different spatial scales...|$|R
