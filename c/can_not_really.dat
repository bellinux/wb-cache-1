Does any one believe that the Countess has a greater share of happiness than the grocer's wife, or is less subject to the miseries which flesh inherits? But such matters cannot be changed by the will. This woman could not bid her daughter go and meet the butcher's son on equal terms, or seek her friends among the milliners of the neighbouring town.

I saw in the Sandwich Islands, once, a picture copied by a talented German artist from an engraving in one of the American illustrated papers. It was an allegory, representing Mr. Davis in the act of signing a secession act or some such document. Over him hovered the ghost of Washington in warning attitude, and in the background a troop of shadowy soldiers in Continental uniform were limping with shoeless, bandaged feet through a driving snow-storm. Valley Forge was suggested, of course. The copy seemed accurate, and yet there was a discrepancy somewhere. After a long examination I discovered what it was--the shadowy soldiers were all Germans! Jeff Davis was a German! even the hovering ghost was a German ghost! The artist had unconsciously worked his nationality into the picture. To tell the truth, I am getting a little perplexed about John the Baptist and his portraits. In France I finally grew reconciled to him as a Frenchman; here he is unquestionably an Italian. What next? Can it be possible that the painters make John the Baptist a Spaniard in Madrid and an Irishman in Dublin? ...|$|E

Poetry <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> be defined because it involves many different aspects of subject matter, form, and effect. Poetry is filled with meaningful words. The meaning of words in poetry can be interpreted based on the various points of view and the ability of readers in interpret it. That is why to understand how to analyze poetry is very important.

One of the reasons might be ERP users who do not accept and use ERP systems properly. Most widely used model for research user acceptance and usage of IT/IS is technological acceptance model (TAM) proposed by Davis (1989). Because TAM is a parsimonious, theoretically and empirically justified model to explain acceptance of IT/IS (Heijden 2001) it has been extended for different IT/IS settings. In contrast to most IT implementation research, the fact that ERP implementation research is focused on one technology (in our case Microsoft Dynamics NAV) has enabled the effect of specific system-technological characterises which could be data quality, system performance, user manuals, system functionality etc. Because there are more system-technological factors which could have influence on NAV user acceptance and usage we research them through more abstract factor (second-order factor) named system-technological characteristics.

Thus when added to a network game engine, mono VoIP service <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> contribute to the gamers ’ sense of virtual world immersion. As a future development, the Immersive VoIP service delivers to each gamer an Auditory Scene, mixing the live voices of surrounding gamers which are all directionally placed and distance attenuated according to the appropriate virtual world positions. In previous work, we have proposed the Wireless Immersive Communication Environment (WICE) which is special type of Immersive VoIP service tailored to the scarce resources of wireless gaming clients. Also in previous work, we have already addressed the processing scalability of WICE with the conjecture of distance-governed relaxation of acceptable angular errors which allows multiple gamers to share the voice localised along the same direction. In this work, we verify the conjecture of acceptable angular errors {{in a series of}} subjective listening tests. An important test finding is the apparent user sensitivity to angular shifts in voice localisation when such auditory movements correspond to little or no visual movements. This finding suggests that the re-establishment of Auditory Scenes across time can not be memoryless in the face of gamer mobility in the virtual world.
