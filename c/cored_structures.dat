There are {{considerable}} {{differences between the}} diffusivities of Ga in ε and δ and a large and anisotropic stress field exists in the <b>coring</b> <b>structure</b> due to the large lattice mismatch between these two phases and strong elastic anisotropy.

Investigations on 20 damaged Joglo buildings reveal that the structure's damage can be classified into three categories: slip between columns and stone foundation, broken joints between outer ring beam and column, and collapse of <b>core</b> <b>structure.</b> Four damage levels were defined: I) damage on the base joint of side structure, II) fatal damage on the side-structure, III) destroyed <b>core</b> <b>structure,</b> and IV) totally collapsed <b>core</b> <b>structure.</b> The side structure {{turns out to be}} relatively weak, while the <b>core</b> <b>structure</b> is able to secure the structural performance of Joglo buildings.

A detailed knowledge of the fine structure of dislocations is essential in analysing the origin of the various deformation features. Atomistic simulation of the <b>core</b> <b>structure</b> and glide of the screw < 101] superdislocation has been made using a Bond-Order Potential for γ-TiAl. We have examined the <b>core</b> <b>structure</b> of the screw < 101] superdislocation starting with initial unrelaxed configurations corresponding to various dislocation dissociations, discussed in the literature. The superdislocation was found to possess in the screw orientation either planar (glissile) or non-planar (sessile) <b>core</b> <b>structures.</b> We studied the response of our core configurations to externally applied shear stress. We considered some implications of the dissociated configurations and their response to externally applied stress on dislocation dynamics, including the issue of dislocation decomposition, the mechanism of locking and the orientation dependence of the dislocation substructure observed in single-phase γ-TiAl.
