5|$|In 1971, Nixon {{proposed}} {{health insurance}} reform—a {{private health insurance}} employer mandate, federalization of Medicaid for poor families with dependent minor children, and support for health maintenance organizations (HMOs). A limited HMO bill was enacted in 1973. In 1974, Nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reform—a private health insurance employer mandate and replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all, with income-based premiums and <b>cost</b> <b>sharing.</b>|$|E
5|$|In February 1974, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{more comprehensive}} health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and <b>cost</b> <b>sharing,</b> and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage. In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial <b>cost</b> <b>sharing.</b> In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health insurance reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through premiums to private health insurance companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.|$|E
5|$|Several {{insurers}} and actuary groups cited uncertainty created by President Trump, specifically non-enforcement {{of the individual}} mandate and not funding <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> reduction subsidies, as contributing 20-30 percentage points to premium increases for the 2018 plan year on the ACA exchanges. In other words, absent Trump's actions against the ACA, premium increases would have averaged 10% or less, rather than the estimated 28-40% under the uncertainty his actions created.|$|E

25|$|There was {{a renewed}} push for health {{insurance}} reform in 1974. In January, representatives Martha Griffiths and James C.

The following month Nixon again proposed the Comprehensive Health Insurance Actan employer mandate to offer private health insurance if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and <b>cost</b> <b>sharing,</b> and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage.

30|$|Given these {{striking}} {{differences between}} firms {{with regard to}} their energy <b>cost</b> <b>shares,</b> we aim to analyze factor substitution possibilities between input factors taking into account different levels of energy needs in the firms’ production processes. Higher energy prices will hit the companies which have high energy shares hardest. However, firms that can easily substitute energy using other production factors are able to mitigate the effects of rising energy prices to a greater extent. One strategy that comes to mind to analyze these possible differences is to split the sample into subsets according to the average energy <b>cost</b> <b>share</b> of the predetermined industry sectors as shown in Table  1. As it turns out, however, the heterogeneity within these sectors regarding the energy <b>cost</b> <b>share</b> is large and at the same time, the heterogeneity between the sectors is relatively small: As the last three columns of the table show, sectors do not differ much regarding the average energy <b>cost</b> <b>share,</b> and in each sector, there are firms with high and with low energy <b>cost</b> <b>shares</b> 10. Hence, we cannot follow this strategy in our analysis 11.|$|R

40|$|Proceedings of the 2001 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 26 and 27, 2001, Athens, Georgia. Legislative study {{committees}} {{have been}} appointed to explore the possibility of establishing a state agricultural <b>cost</b> <b>share</b> program in Georgia. The objective {{of this paper is}} to describe the programs in Kentucky and North Carolina and identify the features that might serve as models for the Georgia program. North Carolina established an Agriculture <b>Cost</b> <b>Share</b> Program in 1983 and the current funding level is $ 6. 9 million per year. Kentucky established a Soil Erosion and Water Quality <b>Cost</b> <b>Share</b> Program in 1994. This is a much smaller program with a current funding level of $ 2. 7 million per year. Both programs are administered through local soil and water conservation district offices and <b>cost</b> <b>share</b> best management practices (BMPs) at a rate of 75 %. BMPs animal waste storage facilities, lagoon closure, riparian buffers, and nutrient management plans. Part of the funds are used for technical support in both programs. A Georgia <b>cost</b> <b>share</b> program should include many of these features including technical and administrative support, a 75 % <b>cost</b> <b>share</b> rate, a focus on a limited number of BMPs, and state-wide application.

25|$|President Trump's {{decision}} in November 2017 {{to end the}} <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> reductions subsidy, a second type of subsidy used to reduce deductibles and co-payments, was expected to increase premiums dramatically, thereby increasing the premium tax credits as well to maintain after-subsidy costs to participants {{at the same percentage}} of income. In other words, the after-subsidy cost would not rise for those with premium tax credit subsidies. Those obtaining their insurance via the exchanges without subsidies would pay up to 20 percentage points more for insurance. CBO also estimated a $200 billion increase in the budget deficit over a decade due to Trump's decision.|$|E
