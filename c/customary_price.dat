50|$|In {{relation}} to <b>customary</b> <b>price</b> points, oligopolies can also generate price points. Such price points {{do not necessarily}} result from collusion, but as an emergent property of oligopolies: when all firms sell at the same price, any firm which attempts to raise its selling price will experience a decrease in sales and revenues (preventing firms from raising prices unilaterally); on the other hand, any firm in an oligopoly which lowers its prices will mostly likely be matched by competitors, resulting in small increases in sales but decreases in revenues (for all the firms in that market). This effect can potentially produce a kinked demand-curve where the kink lies {{at the point of}} the current price-level in the market.These results depend on the elasticity of the demand curve and on the properties of each market.|$|E
50|$|However, in 1779 Nesbitt died £100,000 in debt, and the Court of Chancery made {{a decree}} to auction his {{property}} for {{the relief of}} his creditors, but his nephew anticipating this managed to sell the Nesbitt interest in the borough back to the government's supporters (in the person of The Earl of Darlington) for the very considerable sum of £15,000, shortly before the court's decree came into force. Ministers were free once more to consider both seats at the ministry's disposal. However, Oldfield notes that Nesbitt's power in the borough was one of influence rather than of any direct property in the votes (as {{might have been the}} case in a burgage borough where the right to vote could literally be bought and sold) - and that whatever the bargain between Nesbitt's nephew and Darlington, the voters themselves were not a party to it and had still to be persuaded to co-operate. Therefore what was sold, in effect, was the unhindered right to bribe the voters without interference, the <b>customary</b> <b>price</b> by this time being apparently £100 per vote.|$|E

Rising prescription drug prices can affect consumers, employers, and federal and state governments. Federal policymakers are particularly concerned about rising drug prices as the federal government has assumed greater financial responsibility for prescription drug expenditures with the introduction of a prescription drug benefit to Medicare enrollees in January 2006, known as Medicare Part D. Medicare enrollees are also responsible for a share of drug costs under the Medicare Part D program. As an update to our 2005 report, this report responds to the request from Congress for information on trends in retail prices [...] known as usual and customary prices [...] for prescription drugs frequently used by Medicare enrollees and non-Medicare health insurance enrollees.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Prescription drug spending in 2009 totaled approximately $ 250 billion, of which $ 78 billion [...] or about 31 percent [...] was spent by the federal government. Prescription drug spending by the federal government, patients, and third-party payers, including employers, is driven by many factors, including the prices paid for drugs. In 2007 we reported on trends in retail prices [...] known as usual and <b>customary</b> (U&C) <b>prices</b> [...] for prescription drugs. We found that the average U&C price for the commonly used brand-name prescription drugs we reviewed increased about 6 percent per year from January 2000 through January 2007. Some media reports have suggested that prescription drug prices may have increased more during the debate leading up to passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in March 2010 compared to other recent years. We were requested to examine recent trends in drug prices for brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals. In this report, we (1) examine U&C price trends for commonly used prescription drugs from 2006 through {{the first quarter of}} 2010, the latest available data at the time of our analysis, and compare these trends to those of other medical consumer goods and services, and (2) examine price trends using drug prices other than U&C. Congress also asked us to provide information {{on the extent to which}} prices for individual brand-name drugs changed over the course of this analysis period. In order to determine U&C price trends from 2006 through the first quarter of 2010, we selected four baskets of drugs that were commonly used by consumers during our analysis period. To select our baskets, we used prescription drug utilization data from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Federal Employee Program (BCBS FEP), a large, nationwide insurance plan that covers nearly 5 million individuals. We selected the first basket of drugs based on drug name in order to examine overall price trends of both brand-name and generic drugs. We used BCBS FEP utilization data to identify 100 commonly used drugs, and we considered the brand-name and generic versions to be distinct drugs with distinct levels of utilization. We selected the second and third baskets of drugs to examine trends for brand-name and for generic drugs separately. The second and third baskets of drugs were subsets of the first basket and contained the 55 brand-name and the 45 generic drugs, respectively, from the first basket of 100 drugs. We selected the fourth basket of drugs in order to account for the growing national shift in consumer utilization from brand-name to generic versions of drugs. We used BCBS FEP utilization data to again select 100 commonly used drugs [...] this time based on the active ingredient rather than drug name. In selecting this fourth basket of drugs based on active ingredient, we considered the brand-name and generic versions of drugs with the same active ingredient to be the same drug. The degree of overlap between the contents of the fourth basket and the first basket was high: at least 95 percent of the utilization in one basket was also in the other. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} Customer Cost was {{developed}} by Lauterborn (1990) while developing the customer oriented Marketing Mix- the 4 C concept. 4 C model replaces the earlier 4 Ps of Marketing Mix, here {{the focus is on}} customer and the current chapter is all about the second C of this model i. e. Customer Cost or Price in earlier 4 P model. The Customer Cost concept is {{based on the fact that}} customers are more concerned with the total cost of acquiring a solution of their problem (Product or Service) rather than the price being charged for the Solution (Product or Service) offered by the Company (Moller, 2006), Customer Cost is a assumed to be a better approach as customers are interested in it. price is the quantity of payment or compensation given by one party to another in return for goods or services. In modern economies, prices are generally expressed in units of some form of currency. (For commodities, they are expressed as currency per unit weight of the commodity, e. g. Rs. per kilogram). Although prices could be quoted as quantities of other goods or services this sort of barter exchange is rarely seen. Prices are sometimes quoted in terms of vouchers such as trading stamps and air miles. In some circumstances, cigarettes have been used as currency, for example in prisons, in times of hyperinflation, and in some places during World War 2. In a black market economy, barter is also relatively common. In many financial transactions, it is <b>customary</b> to quote <b>prices</b> in other ways. The most obvious example is in pricing a loan, when the cost will be expressed as the percentage rate of interest. The total amount of interest payable depends upon credit risk, the loan amount and the period of the loan. Other examples can be found in pricing financial derivatives and other financial assets. For instance the price of inflation-linked government securities in several countries is quoted as the actual price divided by a factor representing inflation since the security was issued. Price sometimes refers to the quantity of payment requested by a seller of goods or services, rather than the eventual payment amount. This requested amount is often called the asking price or selling price, while the actual payment may be called the transaction price or traded price. Likewise, the bid price or buying price is the quantity of payment offered by a buyer of goods or services, although this meaning is more common in asset or financial markets than in consumer markets. Price refers to the amount charged for a product or service (Kotler, 2007), from producer’s point of view Price generates revenue (Kotler, 2003) ...|$|R
40|$|Australians {{are among}} the most {{enthusiastic}} online shoppers in the world, writes Scott Ewing and Julian Thomas in The Conversation.. Our most recent survey, published in the CCi Digital Futures report, The Internet in Australia 2012, has found a quarter of Australian internet users make weekly purchases online, compared to 18 % in the UK and only 12 % in New Zealand. And it is rapidly growing. Surveys we have conducted in 2007, 2009 and 2011 showed growth in all commercial activities we asked about. (Although, interestingly for the debate in Australia, we saw stronger growth between 2007 and 2009 than for 2009 to 2011.) And while activity is growing among those who are online, the online Australian population is also continuing to grow. In 2007, 73 % of Australians used the internet; by 2009 this figure had grown to 81 %, and it grew again to 87 % in 2011. There are more Australians online, buying more often. But amidst these figures, reporting has concentrated on flat “official” retail figures, high profile retail collapses and the “threat” of online retail. Poor pre-Christmas sales in 2010 prompted big retailers including Harvey Norman and Myer to press the Federal Government to apply GST to goods bought online worth less than $ 1000. But this reaction gave the impression they had only just heard of the internet. While perfectly justified, their complaint that the GST-free threshold on goods bought by Australians from overseas sites made for an uneven playing field, was a little beside the point. Australians were not going online just to save 10 %. A public campaign to increase the costs of goods bought online was never going to strike a popular chord. So why have Australia’s large bricks and mortar retailers been slow to respond to the challenge of the internet? If the conventional rule is “once bitten, twice shy”, the response to the tech-wreck of the early 2000 s suggests that for Australian retailers, the multiplier is greater than the <b>customary</b> two. Cheaper <b>prices</b> and greater variety has led Australians to purchase overseas. Australian retailers are not the only, or even the greatest, villains in the story. The high Australian dollar, the popularity of overseas travel, and the emergence of transnational online stores like iTunes, has highlighted how Australia is priced differently by many overseas firms. Australia is seen by many as a “high-margin market”, which seems to be code for “a land of sweeping returns”. The number of parallel importing cases before the courts is an interesting by-product of this dynamic. Yet news is far from gloomy for Australian retailers. Australians are keen to shop with Australian websites. Around half of Australian consumers who shop online make most or all of their purchases with Australian sites. Reasons include the belief it is less risky for consumers, as returning products should be simpler and cheaper and that enforcing consumer rights is possible. In addition, two major shifts in online retail have major potential upside for domestic retailers. The first is a shift to purchasing that is more time sensitive. Up until now, online shopping seems to have been driven largely by the chance to save money and acquire goods that are hard to find locally. The next phase is likely to be about convenience; making online purchasing easier than visiting the store. This requires distribution networks that can achieve next day or same day delivery. Large Australian retailers already have distribution networks that should give them a solid platform to compete on this basis. In the United States, there has been a long debate — somewhat like our GST debate — about the application of state-levied sales taxes on online purchases. (Somewhat surprisingly, the Victorian state government joined the tax-free threshold debate just last week.) It’s interesting that some US online retailers now appear to be trading off their out-of-state tax-free transactions against the ability to deliver more quickly, through greater physical proximity to their customers. The second is the rise of the mobile internet, and its promise of nearly ubiquitous, always-on connectivity. Debates about online retailing, like many other internet related debates, have tended to polarise between “the online” and “the offline”. As the internet has matured it turns out that most of the interesting stuff is about reconfiguring the connections between the offline and online worlds. In a dial-up environment, people “went” online; now {{they are more likely to}} be moving between the on-and offline environments; often using the internet to navigate and complement their offline activities. The attraction of the mobile internet is not only the idea that it is available almost everywhere (in cities, at least). It is increasingly sensitive to place. The result will be lots of new opportunities for communication and commerce for traditional retailers. The possibilities include helping customers to find stuff, allowing them to search store layouts, to order for in-store pick up, and to use their mobile phones to purchase in-store. The challenge for retailers is how to best integrate these proliferating channels with their businesses. Many smaller Australian companies and start-ups are showing the way. They will help ensure that local retailing remains competitive in an increasingly dynamic environment.
