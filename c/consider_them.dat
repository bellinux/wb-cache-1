5|$|Edward Grant, a {{historian}} of science, {{has provided evidence}} that medieval scholastic philosophers generally considered the celestial spheres to be solid {{in the sense of}} three-dimensional or continuous, but most did not <b>consider</b> <b>them</b> solid in the sense of hard.

5|$|After the {{violence}} of November 4, the Indianapolis Merchant's Association and other business leaders petitioned Governor Ralston to call out the Indiana National Guard.

Union leaders informed the Governor that calling out the guard would only cause them to escalate the riot and lead to more bloodshed.|$|E

5|$|By {{the thirteenth}} and fourteenth centuries AD, Virgil had gained a {{reputation}} as a virtuous pagan, a term referring to pagans who were never evangelized and consequently during their lifetime had no opportunity to recognize Christ, but nevertheless led virtuous lives, so that it seemed objectionable to <b>consider</b> <b>them</b> damned. Eventually, some Christians sought to reconcile Virgil's works with the supposed Christianity present in them. Consequently, during the Late Antiquity and beyond, many assumed that the puer referenced in the Fourth Eclogue was actually Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|The asteroids are not {{samples of}} the {{primordial}} Solar System. They have undergone considerable evolution since their formation, including internal heating (in the first few {{tens of millions of}} years), surface melting from impacts, space weathering from radiation, and bombardment by micrometeorites. Although some scientists refer to the asteroids as residual planetesimals, other scientists <b>consider</b> <b>them</b> distinct.|$|E

5|$|Capcom's {{partnership}} with Marvel Comics began in 1993 {{with the release}} of The Punisher, an arcade beat 'em up based on the comic book series of the same name. Capcom then created their first Marvel-based fighting game, X-Men: Children of the Atom, in 1994. Marvel Super Heroes soon followed in 1995. Many of the gameplay mechanics used in the Marvel vs. Capcom series were first developed and refined in these two fighting games, serving as precursors to the series. In 2011, then-current Capcom USA Strategic Marketing Director of Online and Community Seth Killian stated that many fighting game aficionados, including himself, <b>consider</b> <b>them</b> to have laid the foundation for the series.|$|E
5|$|Shaffer {{defined the}} Russula brevipes {{varieties}} acrior and megaspora in 1964 from Californian specimens. The former {{is characterized by}} a greenish-blue band that forms {{at the top of the}} stipe, while the latter variety has large spores. The nomenclatural database Index Fungorum does not consider these varieties to have independent taxonomical significance. In a 2012 publication, mycologist Mike Davis and colleagues suggest that western North American Russula brevipes comprise a complex of at least four distinct species. According to MycoBank, the European species Russula chloroides is synonymous with R.brevipes, although Index Fungorum and other sources <b>consider</b> <b>them</b> distinct species.|$|E

5|$|The Emperor assured Mary {{that he had}} {{no doubts}} about her loyalty to the Roman Catholic Church. He had learned that the Queen could not easily be bullied, {{especially}} not in matters which affected her personally. Yet, upon leaving the States General in October 1531, Charles gave her a warning, saying that if his parent, wife, child or sibling became a follower of Luther, he would <b>consider</b> <b>them</b> his greatest enemy. Mary was thus forced to suppress Protestantism in the Netherlands, regardless of her own religious tolerance. However, she always strived to enforce her brother's laws on religion as little as possible. She was accused of protecting Protestants on several occasions.|$|E
5|$|This {{debate is}} also of {{importance}} when classifying the trust as either constructive or express, {{a matter of}} considerable debate. On one view, if the traditional theory is correct, secret trusts are created by the courts, and are thus constructive; if the more modern view is correct, the trusts exist without the court's permission, and are express trusts. However, a secret trust {{does not have to}} obey the separate formalities of the Law of Property Act 1925, even when it concerns land and one solution to this problem is to <b>consider</b> <b>them</b> constructive. Some commentators believe that half-secret trusts may fall into a different category to fully secret trusts in this regard.|$|E
5|$|When the entourage reached Rome in {{the autumn}} of 219, Comazon and other allies of Julia Maesa and Elagabalus were given {{powerful}} and lucrative positions, to the chagrin of many senators who did not <b>consider</b> <b>them</b> worthy of such privileges. After his tenure as Praetorian prefect, Comazon would serve as the city prefect of Rome three times, and as consul twice. Elagabalus soon devalued the Roman currency. He decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 58% to 46.5%— the actual silver weight dropping from 1.82grams to 1.41grams. He also demonetized the antoninianus during this period in Rome.|$|E

5|$|With the {{publication}} of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou publicly discussed aspects of her personal life. She was respected as a spokesperson for black people and women, and her works have been considered a defense of black culture. Her works are widely used in schools and universities worldwide, although {{attempts have been made}} to ban her books from some U.S. libraries. Angelou's most celebrated works have been labeled as autobiographical fiction, but many critics <b>consider</b> <b>them</b> to be autobiographies. She made a deliberate attempt to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing and expanding the genre. Her books center on themes such as racism, identity, family and travel.|$|E
5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often <b>consider</b> <b>them</b> as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{often used}} Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland—commonly known as Holinshed's Chronicles—as {{a source for}} his plays, and in Macbeth he borrows from several of the tales in that work. Holinshed portrays Banquo as a {{historical}} figure: he is an accomplice in Mac Bethad mac Findlaích's (Macbeth's) murder of Donnchad mac Crínáin (King Duncan) and plays {{an important part in}} ensuring that Macbeth, not Máel Coluim mac Donnchada (Malcolm), takes the throne in the coup that follows. Holinshed in turn used an earlier work, the Scotorum Historiae (1526–7) by Hector Boece, as his source. Boece's work is the first known record of Banquo and his son Fleance; and scholars such as David Bevington generally <b>consider</b> <b>them</b> fictional characters invented by Boece. In Shakespeare's day, however, they were considered historical figures of great repute, and the king, James I, based his claim to the throne in part on a descent from Banquo. The House of Stuart was descended from Walter fitz Alan, Steward of Scotland, and he was believed to have been the grandson of Fleance and Gruffydd ap Llywelyn's daughter, Nesta ferch Gruffydd. In reality Walter fitz Alan was the son of Alan fitz Flaad, a Breton knight.|$|E
