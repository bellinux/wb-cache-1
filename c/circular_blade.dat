40|$|In most cases, {{the cutting}} of wood is {{proceeded}} at high feed speed and high cutting {{speed of the}} <b>circular</b> saw <b>blades.</b> The <b>circular</b> saw <b>blades</b> teeth rotate in outer ambient and thus are source of noise with unadvisable effects on working environment. The results of the measuring the noise level of three structuraly different <b>circular</b> saw <b>blades</b> are presented in this paper. The types of the <b>circular</b> saw <b>blades</b> are: with six compensating slots in radial direction, with six compensating slots in tangential direction and with six sigmoid compensating slots. The diameters of the <b>circular</b> saw <b>blades</b> were 350 mm. The measurements of the noise level were performed in the cutting process using the standard equipments. The <b>circular</b> saw <b>blades</b> with compensating slots emited high cutting noise level but their noise level was different. The <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> with sigmoid compensating slots had the lowest noise levels {{in the range of}} (2 5) dB (A) as compared with the others saw blades...|$|R
30|$|When <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> {{is cutting}} the work piece, {{tangential}} and radial tensile stresses are produced {{because of the}} centrifugal force generated by the higher rotational speed of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade.</b> Meanwhile, thermal stress is produced because {{the temperature in the}} edge of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> is higher than other regions. The thermal stress will lead to a large tangential compressive stress in the edge of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> with the increase of temperature difference between the edge and center of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade,</b> which could cause the buckling deformation of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade,</b> reduction of cutting precision and machining quality of the surface, increase of kerf loss and shortening of saw life. The tensioning processes such as hammering, rolling and heating are proposed and applied {{in order to avoid the}} above-mentioned phenomenon. The tangential tensile tensioning stress field is produced during tensioning process in order to compensate the tangential compressive stress, which will improve the stability and quality of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> [1, 2]. Therefore, the tangential tensioning stress distribution after tensioning is the key factor that determines the quality of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade.</b>|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  4, the {{tensioning}} stress {{distribution of the}} <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> calculated by the FEM model followed the same trend as previous research results [2, 6, 18]. The values of tensioning stress of the <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> calculated by the FEM model and the measured results in radial path of the <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> were similar in most regions. The results mentioned above demonstrated that the tensioning stress of the <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> calculated by the model in this paper was true and reliable. The tensioning stress distribution of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> after roll tensioning process was the key analysis object in the following.|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  11, the {{tangential}} tensioning stress distribution of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> after unloading and the measured results in specified radial path of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> {{had the same}} trend and the value was similar in most regions, which proved that the tangential tensioning stress of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> calculated by finite element method in this paper was true and reliable. In the edge area of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade,</b> the tangential tensioning stress was increased with the ratio of radius, and the feasibility of multi-spot pressure tensioning process was theoretically proved.|$|R
30|$|However, {{thermal stress}} is {{produced}} when <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> is working, because the temperature {{at the edge}} of the blade is higher than that in other regions of the blade. It will cause high tangential compressive stress on the edge of the <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade,</b> causing a buckling deformation that reduces cutting precision, increases kerf loss, and shortens the saw’s life [1, 2]. Thin <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> is more easily affected by thermal stress.

50|$|A saw {{is a tool}} {{consisting}} of a tough blade, wire, or chain with a hard toothed edge. It is used to cut through material, very often wood. The cut is made by placing the toothed edge against the material and moving it forcefully forth and less forcefully back or continuously forward.

30|$|The {{simulation}} {{results showed that}} rolling force was increased linearly with yield strength of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade,</b> which brought challenges to the roll tensioning equipment of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade.</b>|$|R
30|$|Tensioning is {{the most}} {{important}} and advanced technological process for production of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> for avoiding the above-mentioned phenomenon. Among all the tensioning processes, roll tensioning process is most widely applied in the cutting tool industry. The tangential tensile tensioning stress field is produced which can compensate for the tangential compressive stress caused by thermal stress and improve the stability of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> [3 – 5]. However, <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> can also obtain radial compressive tensioning stress during roll tensioning process which is easy for the blade to lose stability and buckle into a “dish” shape. The thin <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> requires higher tangential tensile tensioning stress and lower radial compressive tensioning stress for maintaining stability, which brings a challenge to roll tensioning process of thin <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>Circular</b> saw <b>blades</b> {{are very}} {{widespread}} in wood machining. They {{are used in}} different batches and sizes and in large quantities from hand tools to large machining centers. Because of this huge range of applications the circular saws have gained great importance in the industry. The rising request to improve the cutting quality, reduce the noise emission and increase the life time requires improvement of the dynamic behavior of the <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade.</b> The roll tensioning of the <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> has been empirically established {{as a solution to}} improve the static and dynamic properties of the <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade.</b> However, there are several influencing parameters for this process that have not yet been studied scientifically accurate. A scientific and economical solution for the study of various roll tensioning parameters is a simulation model based on finite elements method (FEM) that analyzes the effects on the dynamic behavior of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade.</b> A simulation model for roll tensioning of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blades</b> was developed in this study. With this simulation model, the residual stresses induced by the roll tensioning can be calculated. The induced residual stresses are actually responsible for the changing of dynamic properties of the <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade,</b> such as the shifting of eigenvalues and reduction of side run out. Furthermore, this simulation model allows the investigation of various roll tensioning parameters. This investigation helps {{to gain a better understanding}} of the relationship between roll tensioning and improvement of dynamic behavior of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blades.</b> Furthermore, it helps to determine the optimization potential of the roll tensioning process, which is one of the important stages of the production line of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blades...</b>|$|R

30|$|In this paper, a 2 -D and 3 -D {{finite element}} model of roll {{tensioning}} process of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> were established by Static/General module of ABAQUS software based on finite element method. The rolling force and tensioning stress distribution of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> were calculated by these two models which were proved to be true and reliable. The effects of yield strength of <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> on tensioning stress distribution and rolling force were studied. The research achievements showed that a <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> made with high yield strength obtained a higher tangential compressive stress and radial compressive stress in the rolled region during roll tensioning process, which has both advantages and disadvantages for {{the stability of the}} saw <b>blade.</b> Besides, a <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> made with high yield strength also put forward higher requirements for roll tensioning equipment because of the large rolling force during roll tensioning process.|$|R
30|$|The multi-spot {{pressure}} tensioning {{process of}} <b>circular</b> saw <b>blade</b> {{was built by}} dynamic/explicit solution module of the finite element software called ABAQUS for avoiding non-convergence and improving the computational efficiency.

50|$|More recently, {{with the}} {{invention}} of the Wood-Mizer in 1982, portable bandsaw mills represented a dramatic shift in design. Unlike traditional mills, they used a thin-kerf blade of the type used on a band saw rather than a <b>circular</b> <b>blade,</b> which reduced weight and cost, and reduced the size and weight of the bearings and support blocks. The smaller kerf on these blades dramatically increased the yield from a given log. Use of band blades also allowed for a different design where the head, consisting of the blade and a power source, moves back and forth while the log remains stationary. This is in contrast to traditional mills where the log moves on a trolley while the blade remains fixed. Aside from the original Wood-Mizer company, many companies now manufacture and sell personal and portable sawmills.|$|E
50|$|Wobble blade or wobble dado or {{adjustable}} dado {{consists of}} a <b>circular</b> <b>blade</b> mounted on an adjustable multi-piece hub, that varies {{the angle of the}} blade to the arbor shaft. The width of the dado cut increases as the angle gets farther from the radial normal (90°) to the arbor. While it is possible to adjust the thickness of the cut while the saw is mounted on the arbor, accurate adjustment is usually difficult because tightening the arbor nut often changes the adjustment. Also, because of their inherent geometry wobble blades can only produce a flat-bottomed dado at one width setting, which may be a disadvantage in certain joinery operations. Another disadvantage of a wobble dado over stacked dado is undesirable vibrations. The magnitude of these vibrations varies with the blade's angular offset. In other words, the wider the dado, the stronger the vibrations.|$|E
