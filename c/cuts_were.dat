5|$|Due to its graphic content, {{there are}} several {{different}} versions of Cannibal Holocaust in circulation which are edited to varying degrees. In the UK, the film was originally released on VHS by Go Video in 1982 with approximately six minutes of cuts. These <b>cuts</b> <b>were</b> self-imposed by the distributor, possibly due to technical limitations of the tape. In 2001, the film was passed for release on DVD by the BBFC with 5 minutes and 44 seconds of cuts to remove scenes of animal cruelty and sexual violence; all but 15 seconds of these <b>cuts</b> <b>were</b> waived for a re-release in 2011. The latter release also includes a new edit sponsored by Deodato which reduces the violence toward animals.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, cuts of beef for {{retail sale}} include various beefsteaks, {{as well as}} stew meat and {{hamburger}} meat. In the U.S. circa 1956, approximately 24% of retail beef <b>cuts</b> <b>were</b> beef steaks.|$|E

At the time, state budget <b>cuts</b> <b>were</b> afflicting the university, and he returned it to growth with increases in the university's science research funding from the federal government. He also presided over the founding of Stony Brook University Medical Center.|$|E

5|$|Mills made {{large-scale}} {{changes to}} the squad over the summer of 2006, although a few months into 2006–07 more budget <b>cuts</b> <b>were</b> made and this limited his ability to add to a squad lacking in depth. When he left Alfreton they were 13th in the Conference North, and he was playing less frequently, making five appearances in 2006–07.|$|E
5|$|One {{week before}} Greeds release the New York State Motion Picture Committee (which censored films) demanded several more cuts on moral grounds. These cuts {{included}} {{the administration of}} ether in the dental scenes and certain instances of foul language. Although these <b>cuts</b> <b>were</b> made to prints that were screened in New York State, the footage was kept in many other prints.|$|E
5|$|Prey was {{distributed}} by Supreme in the UK, where the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) cleared it for cinema release in November 1977. Unspecified <b>cuts</b> <b>were</b> {{required for the}} film to be awarded an X certificate. In London, Prey was screened alongside the 1973 Western Charley One-Eye as half of a double feature. The film was re-rated 18 prior to its first home video release in 1986.|$|E

50|$|A <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> a {{partition}} of the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets. A minimum <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> a <b>cut</b> {{for which the}} size or weight of the <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> not larger than the size of any other cut. For an unweighted graph, the minimum <b>cut</b> would simply <b>be</b> the <b>cut</b> with the least edges. For a weighted graph, {{the sum of all}} edges' weight on the cut determines whether it <b>is</b> a minimum <b>cut.</b> In practice, the minimum <b>cut</b> problem <b>is</b> always discussed with the maximum flow problem, to explore the maximum capacity of a network, since the minimum <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> a bottleneck in a graph or network.|$|R
5|$|The {{total cost}} of the picture was {{reported}} variously as $935,000 or $1.5 million. Even the lower figure was an exceptionally large amount for the time. To recoup its costs, MGM kept the film in circulation for many years. The running time of the film in previews was 160 minutes. Major <b>cuts</b> <b>were</b> made afterward, however. The final running time for the film was either 117 or 120 minutes.|$|E
5|$|While {{the cast}} {{departed}} {{to work on}} other projects, the post-production team was tasked with finalizing the film {{in time for a}} Christmas release; the resulting work would take twice as long as the filming process had taken. Editor Todd Ramsay and assistants spent principal photography syncing film and audio tracks. The resulting rough <b>cuts</b> <b>were</b> used to formulate plans for sound effects, music, and optical effects that would be added later.|$|E
5|$|GoldenEye was edited to be {{guaranteed}} a PG-13 rating from the MPAA and a 12 rating from the BBFC. The cuts included the visible bullet impact to Trevelyan's head {{when he is}} shot in the prologue, several additional deaths during the sequence in which Onatopp guns down the workers at the Severnaya station, more explicit footage and violent behaviour in the Admiral's death, extra footage of Onatopp's death, and Bond giving her a rabbit punch in the car. In 2006, the film was re-mastered and re-edited for the James Bond Ultimate Edition DVD in which the BBFC <b>cuts</b> <b>were</b> restored, causing the rating to be changed to 15. However, the original MPAA edits still remain.|$|E

Matching <b>Cut</b> <b>is</b> {{the problem of}} deciding {{whether or not a}} given graph has a matching <b>cut,</b> which <b>is</b> known to be NP-complete even when restricted to bipartite graphs. It has been proved that Matching <b>Cut</b> <b>is</b> polynomially solvable for graphs of diameter two. In this paper, we show that, for any fixed integer d geq 4, Matching <b>Cut</b> <b>is</b> NP-complete in the class of graphs of diameter d. This almost resolves an open problem posed by Borowiecki and Jesse-Józefczyk in [Matching cutsets in graphs of diameter 2, Theoretical Computer Science 407 (2008) 574 - 582]. We then show that, for any fixed integer d geq 5, Matching <b>Cut</b> <b>is</b> NP-complete even when restricted to the class of bipartite graphs of diameter d. Complementing the hardness results, we show that Matching <b>Cut</b> <b>is</b> in polynomial-time solvable in the class of bipartite graphs of diameter at most three, and point out a new and simple polynomial-time algorithm solving Matching Cut in graphs of diameter 2...|$|R
5|$|Golding left to lead Kent State, {{and with}} a brief {{intermission}} of Academic Vice President Trevor Colbourn serving as president, Thomas B. Day became the sixth president in 1978. When Proposition 13 passed, the school faced budget issues and Day proposed abolishing some departments, combining others, and laying off approximately 80 faculty members. However, budget <b>cuts</b> <b>were</b> deemed not necessary, and on April 8, 1980, Day again proposed cutting 115 faculty members and four departments due to foreseeing upcoming budget cuts; on May 16, 1980 he recanted his comments.|$|E
5|$|Hopes {{that the}} ballet {{would be ready}} in May were dashed and the opening night was {{postponed}} several times. Grisi was absent {{for a few days}} and her return was delayed to protect her health. Lighting, trapdoors, and scene changes needed further rehearsals. <b>Cuts</b> <b>were</b> made in Grisi's role to spare the dancer's health. Instead of returning to her tomb {{at the end of the}} ballet, it was decided that she would be placed on a bed of flowers and sink slowly into the earth. This touch preserved the romantic mood of the Act II finale.|$|E
5|$|McKenzie {{was killed}} on 17 July 1889 by {{severance}} of the left carotid artery. Several minor bruises and <b>cuts</b> <b>were</b> found on the body, discovered in Castle Alley, Whitechapel. One of the examining pathologists, Thomas Bond, believed {{this to be a}} Ripper murder, though his colleague George Bagster Phillips, who had examined the bodies of three previous victims, disagreed. Later writers are also divided between those who think that her murderer copied the Ripper's modus operandi to deflect suspicion from himself, and those who ascribe it to the Ripper.|$|E

5|$|The hotel {{closed in}} 2000 after Occupational Safety and Health Administration {{building}} inspectors found safety problems during a 1999 inspection. The building's owner, Heaven on Earth Inns Corp, run by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, looked into several options before selling {{the property to}} Rubloff, Inc., which in 2001 announced plans to convert the building into condominiums priced as high as $8.5million. Rubloff's plans were unsuccessful due to financing difficulties and a lackluster market for buyers of Blackstone condominiums. Even two rounds of price <b>cuts</b> <b>were</b> not enough to spur interest in the condo opportunities and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's non-profit organization was unable to obtain financing.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} UK release received various cuts to {{scenes of}} violence and martial arts weaponry, and to reduce the impact of sound effects, to receive a more box-office-friendly 12 certificate. Further <b>cuts</b> <b>were</b> made to the video/DVD release to retain this rating. These edits were restored for the Ultimate Edition DVD release in the UK, which was consequently upgraded to a 15 certificate. However, upon {{the release of the}} Blu-ray in 2012, it was rated back down to a 12 uncut.|$|E
5|$|These {{and other}} {{continuing}} fan activities eventually persuaded Universal Studios {{to produce a}} feature film, Serenity. (The title of Serenity was chosen, according to Whedon, because Fox still owned {{the rights to the}} name 'Firefly'). Numerous early screenings of rough film <b>cuts</b> <b>were</b> held for existing fans starting in May 2005 as an attempt to create a buzz to increase ticket sales when the final film cut was released widely on September 30, 2005. The film was not as commercially successful as fans had hoped, opening at number two and making only $40 million worldwide during its initial theatrical release.|$|E

The final cut was given a mediocre reception by Universal Pictures executives, causing the film's release to be postponed for a year. It received an A certificate from the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) on 26 March 1969, dispelling rumours of an X rating and fulfilling the Andersons' objective that Doppelgänger be suitable for children accompanied by adults. To secure an A certificate, brief <b>cuts</b> <b>were</b> made to shots of contraceptive pills, shortening the running time from the original 104 minutes.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} traffic flowed, crews had not {{finished}} some final tasks, such as painting stripes. Motorists saw a relocation with several mountain cuts built high up the canyon wall, {{with a view}} of the slide and former lake. The roadbed was not expected to last, as weather conditions had been unfavorable when the asphalt was laid. Two mountain <b>cuts</b> <b>were</b> unstable, requiring several months of work before they could be left unattended. During this time, the state stationed two full-time watches at the cuts, who would close the road while falling rocks were cleared. The cut through Billies Mountain was described by the construction crews as a new, man-made mountain pass.|$|E
