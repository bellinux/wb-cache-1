5|$|Hamilton {{divided the}} debt into {{national}} and state, and further divided {{the national debt}} into foreign and domestic debt. While there was agreement {{on how to handle}} the foreign debt (especially with France), there was not with regards to the national debt held by domestic creditors. During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with promissory notes and IOUs that plummeted in price during the Confederation. In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators for as little as fifteen to twenty <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> the dollar.|$|E

25|$|After the WWF did not buy out Sting's {{contract}} with AOL Time Warner, he rejected a buyout offer of 50 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> the dollar from AOL Time Warner, instead waiting until his contract expired in March 2002 (he announced a short-lived retirement in February of that year). Borden then entered into contract {{negotiations with the}} WWF, but ultimately did not join the promotion.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, the New York City Transit System {{showed an}} {{operating}} surplus on the five-cent fare, because gasoline was rationed and auto riders had {{to abandon their}} cars for subway and bus travel. Factories began to work around the clock, and therefore business boomed. Transit repairs were kept at a minimum as basic materials were in short supply for civilian use. Operating revenues were raised and maintenance costs were reduced, but as a result, the future problems of deferred maintenance and falling ridership. In 1946, costs rose and profits turned to losses, and to obtain needed funds, the fare was raised in 1948 to ten <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> the subways and elevated, and to seven <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> the surface lines. This increase only produced a revenue surplus for a single year. In 1951 a uniform ten-cent fare was established on both the rapid transit and surface lines. Operating deficits continued to add up and public dissatisfaction with the transit system grew, as equipment was deteriorating, and train schedules being difficult to abide by.|$|E

Patterson's house in Corning was auctioned off to pay creditors - an early bid came in at $10,000.00. His father also had to surrender his priority claims against the bank.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{a growing}} {{acceptance}} of Māori culture in wider New Zealand society, the settlements have generated controversy on both sides. Some Māori {{have complained that}} the settlements occur {{at a level of}} between 1 and 2.5 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> the dollar {{of the value of the}} confiscated lands; conversely, some non-Māori denounce the settlements and socioeconomic iniatives as amounting to race-based preferential treatment. Both of these sentiments were expressed during the New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy in 2004.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{guarantee}} of how much money will remain to repay bondholders. As an example, after an accounting scandal and a Chapter 11 bankruptcy at the giant telecommunications company Worldcom, in 2004 its bondholders ended up being paid 35.7 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> the dollar. In a bankruptcy involving reorganization or recapitalization, as opposed to liquidation, bondholders may end up having the value of their bonds reduced, often through an exchange for a smaller number of newly issued bonds.|$|E
25|$|The railroad's locomotives, rail cars, equipment, tracks, {{and real}} estate were sold to other railroads or to scrappers. Gibbons was able to raise more than $500 million in the liquidation, paying off all the railroad's creditors, {{bondholders}} and all other debts in full at face value with interest. Henry Crown was ultimately proven correct, as both he and other bondholders who had purchased Rock Island debt for <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> the dollar during the low ebb in prices did especially well.|$|E
25|$|In 1859 Gould began {{speculative}} investing {{by buying}} stock in small railways. Gould's father-in-law Daniel S.

Gould purchased stock for 10 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> the dollar, which left him {{in control of the}} company. Through the Civil War era, he did more speculation on railroad stocks in New York City. In 1863 he was appointed manager of the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad.|$|E

25|$|Morris and Nicholson {{honestly}} believed that, {{if their}} cash flow problems were fixed, {{they could make}} payments on the property they owned and their shares would be returned to them. This proved incorrect. On October 23, 1807, all stock in the company was sold at 7 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> the dollar to the accountants managing the Aggregate Fund. By 1856, the company had produced just over $92,000 in income. Morris and Nicholson's heirs sued to recover the stock and {{gain access to the}} income. In 1880, each estate was awarded $9,962.49.|$|E
25|$|The Great Railroad Strike of 1922, a {{nationwide}} railroad shop workers strike, began on July 1. The immediate {{cause of the}} strike was the Railroad Labor Board's announcement that hourly wages for railway repair and maintenance workers would be cut by seven <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> July 1. This cut, which represented an average 12% wage decrease for the affected workers, prompted a shop workers vote {{on whether or not}} to strike. The operators' union did not join in the strike, and the railroads employed strikebreakers to fill three-fourths of the roughly 400,000 vacated positions, increasing hostilities between the railroads and the striking workers.|$|E
25|$|Large {{quantities}} of goods were in Britain or in transit when Washington suddenly and unexpectedly terminated Lend-Lease on 21 August 1945. The British economy had been heavily geared towards war production (around 55% GDP) and had drastically reduced its exports. The UK therefore relied on Lend-Lease imports to obtain essential consumer commodities {{such as food}} while it {{could no longer afford}} to pay for these items using export profits. The end of lend-lease thus came as a great economic shock. Britain needed to retain some of this equipment in the immediate post war period. As a result, the Anglo-American loan came about. Lend-lease items retained were sold to Britain at the knockdown price of about 10 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> the dollar giving an initial value of £1.075 billion.|$|E

25|$|On March 9, 1933, Roosevelt sent to Congress the Emergency Banking Act, {{drafted in}} large part by Hoover's top advisors. The act was passed and signed into law the same day. It {{provided}} for a system of reopening sound banks under Treasury supervision, with federal loans available if needed. Three-quarters of the banks in the Federal Reserve System reopened within the next three days. Billions of dollars in hoarded currency and gold flowed back into them within a month, thus stabilizing the banking system. By the end of 1933, 4,004 small local banks were permanently closed and merged into larger banks. Their deposits totalled $3.6billion; depositors lost a total of $540million, and eventually received on average 85 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> the dollar of their deposits; it is a common myth that they received nothing back.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the {{province}}'s public health care program {{was not lost on}} the federal government. Another Saskatchewan politician, newly elected Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, decreed in 1958 that any province seeking to introduce a hospital plan would receive 50 <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> the dollar from the federal government. In 1962, Diefenbaker appointed Justice Emmett Hall—also of Saskatchewan, a noted jurist and Supreme Court Justice—to Chair a Royal Commission on the national health system—the Royal Commission on Health Services. In 1964, Justice Hall recommended a nationwide adoption of Saskatchewan's model of public health insurance. In 1966, the Liberal minority government of Lester B. Pearson created such a program, with the federal government paying 50% of the costs and the provinces the other half. So, the adoption of health care across Canada ended up being the work of three men with diverse political ideals - Tommy Douglas, John Diefenbaker and Lester Pearson.|$|E
25|$|In March 1953, the Board of Transportation was abolished, and was {{replaced}} by the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA). The NYCTA formally succeeded the BOT on June 15, 1953, being composed of five unsalaried members. Hugh Casey was elected as the agency's chairman at the authority's first meeting. The new Transit Authority was modeled after the existing Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, the latter of which is also now part of the MTA. At this time, the city government leased the IRT, BMT, and IND subway lines and the surface system (buses and, until 1956 street cars). A major goal of the formation of the NYCTA was to remove transit policy, and especially the setting of the transit fare, from City politics. The fare was increased to fifteen <b>cents</b> <b>on</b> July 25, 1953, and a token was introduced for paying subway and elevated fares. Bus and trolley fares continued to be paid by cash only.|$|E
