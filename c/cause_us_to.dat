500|$|Professor Steven B. Lichtman of the {{department}} {{of political science at the}} University of Vermont reviewed the book for the Law and Politics Book Review, and identified Nelson's pluralist theory as a significant contribution. Lichtman commented, [...] "The most important contribution of Beyond the First Amendment is its attempt to offer up a new model for understanding and safeguarding free speech". He praised the author for supporting his model with case history: [...] "As a purely philosophical matter, Nelson’s pluralist framework is certainly intriguing. The model must be more than a mere talking point, though, and Nelson wisely endeavors to show how the pluralist framework can be deployed as a means of resolving actual cases". Lichtman concluded by recommending the work for academic scholars: [...] "Beyond the First Amendment is an intriguing and important contribution to the literature on free speech. While it is likely beyond the grasp of all but the most talented undergraduates, its overview of First Amendment theory is an excellent resource for graduate students beginning to explore the field. For scholars, it is a challenging and provocative work sure to <b>cause</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> reassess how we teach and write about the subject".|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{commented on}} the {{controversy}} over lines in the film talking about the mentally disabled. Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel wrote that the film [...] "...is just sophomoric enough to offend. And while it is also funny, it is without the empathy or compassion to <b>cause</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> wonder why we are laughing." [...] Christian Toto of The Washington Times argued against the opposition, [...] "Tropic Thunder is drawing fire from special interest groups for ...its frequent {{use of the word}} 'retard', but discerning audiences will know where the humor is targeted. And they'll be laughing too hard to take offense." [...] Kurt Loder of MTV contrasted the opposition to the lines with Downey character portrayal of an African American, [...] "The scene in which the derisive Alpa Chino [...] nails Lazarus' recitation of black-uplift homilies as nothing more than the lyrics to the Jeffersons theme is funny; but the one in which Lazarus quietly explains to Speedman that his Simple Jack character failed because he made the mistake of going 'full retard'—rather than softening his character with cuteness in the manner of Forrest Gump—is so on-the-nose accurate, it takes your breath away." ...|$|E

What is this commerce? Thousands of years have passed by, and, year after year, all the nations of the earth have, each year, sought the rich commerce of that country; all have enjoyed the riches of the East. That trade was sought by King Solomon, by Tyre, Sidon; this wealth found its way to Egypt, and at last to Rome, to France, Portugal, Spain, Holland, England, and finally to this Republic. How vast and incomparably rich must be that country and commerce, which has never ceased, one day, from the highest point of Jewish splendor to the instant that I am speaking, to supply the whole globe with all the busy imagination of man can desire for his ease, comfort, and enjoyment! Whilst we Rave so fair an opportunity offered to participate so largely in all this wealth and enjoyment, if not to govern and direct the whole, can it be possible that doubt, or mere points of speculation, will weigh with the House and <b>cause</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> lose forever the brightest prospect ever presented to the eyes of a nation?" ...|$|E

[...] This was the first attempt to quantify the casualties from the LRA conflict, but did not include deaths from conflict-related malnutrition and disease. [...] The spokesperson for the Ugandan military expressed doubt about the accuracy of the estimate: [...] "They are simply giving a probing figure. They do not have accurate information.

Challenged by those subversive elements who, by encouraging us to quarrel among ourselves may <b>cause</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> destroy ourselves. The 'divide and conquer strategy' that might well eliminate a great American institution." [...] President Collins warned that the anti-discrimination issue would be raised at the next Phi Sigma Kappa convention. The Bedford Resolution was a policy and was more easily changed than a constitutional measure or bylaw. Two years after its passage, at the 1954 Convention the Bedford Resolution was repealed in favor of a non-legislative [...] "Gentlemen's Agreement" [...] to ban non-whites. [...] This much weaker, short-lived, informal agreement also encouraged local chapters not to admit minorities to membership.|$|E

[...] "In respect of our partners we can only say this, at no time in our discussions did they convey to us that the plan was unacceptable so long as president Aristide remained in office. Nor did they suggest to us anything of a nature pertaining to the conduct of President Aristide in office that would <b>cause</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> come to the judgment ourselves that he was unsuited to be the President of Haïti," [...] Mr. Patterson said.

Then Lomborg proceeds to weigh the causes championed by the environmental movement against a deliberately circumscribed universe of other possible [...] "good causes." [...] It is up to us, he says, to make responsible decisions about whether to protect the environment or [...] "boost Medicaid, increase funding to the arts, or cut taxes. ... The worse they can make this state appear, the easier it is for them to convince us we need to spend more money on the environment rather on hospitals, kindergartens, etc." [...] A few pages later he again claims {{that the purpose of the}} Litany is to <b>cause</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> prioritize the environment over [...] "hospitals, child day care, etc." ... But who is really failing to consider how our money is spent? As Lomborg notes, [...] "We will never have enough money," [...] and therefore, [...] "Prioritization is absolutely essential." [...] Why, then, does he weigh the environment only against hospitals and childcare, rather than against, say, industry subsidies and defense spending?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the position taken by the Karaites {{in regards to the}} authority of the Talmud, Orthodox Judaism counters first {{that the majority of the}} Oral Law codified in the Mishnah and Talmud are the legal rulings of the last Sanhedrin, a body of 71 elders that made up the highest court of jurisprudence in ancient Israel, and that not all of the Oral Law are literally [...] "Laws given to Moses on Mount Sinai". The decisions made by this High Court must be upheld, per se the Law of Moses (Deuteronomy 17), this gives their legal rulings divine authority. Karaites reject the authority of this Sanhedrin that developed during the second Temple period partly because it was an admixture of different people and not just priests and levites as mandated by the Torah. The Sanhedrin also took legal authority away from the descendants of Zadok who served as priests in the Temple in Jerusalem. This is essentially the same view held by the Sadducees and Boethusians during the second Temple period. Secondly Rabbinic Judaism points to the innumerable examples of biblical commandments that are either too ambiguous or documented in such a concise fashion that proper adherence could not be enforced on a national scale without the further legislation provided by the Talmud. Karaites respond that the Torah itself states [...] "this law I am commanding you is not too hard for you, neither is it far off. It is not in the heavens, to say, who shall ascend into the heavens and bring it to us, and <b>cause</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> understand it, that we do it?" [...] indicating the Torah could easily be understood by the average Israelite. Examples cited in Rabbinic Judaism as laws requiring rabbinic explanation include: ...|$|E
