25|$|Most Japanese use suihanki (rice cookers) {{to which}} {{measured}} amounts of washed rice and water are added. The rice is first washed to release excess starch. Then, before cooking {{it is usually}} soaked in water for between half an hour in summer, and two hours in winter. Soaking times also depend on the quality and freshness of the rice. The rice is then boiled using a ratio of about five parts of water to four parts of rice – though with fresher rice, the ratio <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> to 1-to-1. After this, it is steamed until {{the centre of the}} rice becomes soft. Salt is not added to the rice.|$|E
500|$|Subwoofers also vary {{in regard}} to the sound {{pressure}} levels achievable and the distortion levels they can produce over their range. Some subwoofers, such as [...] "The Abyss" [...] by MartinLogan for example can reproduce pitches down to around 18Hz (which is about the pitch of the lowest rumbling notes on a huge pipe organ with -16Hz-bass pipes) to 120Hz (±3dB). Nevertheless, even though the Abyss subwoofer <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> to 18Hz, its lowest frequency and maximum SPL with a limit of 10% distortion is 35.5Hz and 79.8dB at 2 meters. This means that a person choosing a subwoofer needs to consider more than just the lowest pitch that the sub can reproduce.|$|E

500|$|When Ehrich first {{stepped into}} the role, he stated: [...] "There [...] so many places where they can go with this role. I have just gotten back into Genoa City. It’s such a {{vulnerable}} age, so really there [...] so many different paths I <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>down.</b> And there’s so much that can happen. I’m very, very curious to see where they go with it." [...] When asked how he would describe Fenmore, Ehrich said: [...] "He is definitely figuring himself out. You’re {{on the brink of}} adulthood. You have to start taking a bit of responsibility. [...] your hormones start kicking in hardcore. So he’s definitely going through some stuff." [...] In another interview, he described Fenmore as [...] "trying to find his place in the world", saying: [...] "When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he is. He has such a strict dad, who just became D.A., so of course his morals are so strong and everything is black and white, right or wrong." [...] Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that the character had become [...] "creepy" [...] during his angst and acting out.|$|E

2500|$|Short selling is {{sometimes}} referred to as a [...] "negative income investment strategy" [...] because there is no potential for dividend income or interest income. Stock is held only long enough to be sold pursuant to the contract, and one's return is therefore limited to short term capital gains, which are taxed as ordinary income. For this reason, buying shares (called [...] "going long") has a very different risk profile from selling short. [...] Furthermore, a [...] "long's" [...] losses are limited because the price <b>can</b> only <b>go</b> <b>down</b> to zero, but gains are not, as there is no limit, in theory, on how high the price <b>can</b> <b>go.</b> [...] On the other hand, the short seller's possible gains are limited to the original price of the stock, which <b>can</b> only <b>go</b> <b>down</b> to zero, whereas the loss potential, again in theory, has no limit. [...] For this reason, short selling probably is most often used as a hedge strategy to manage the risks of long investments.|$|R

5000|$|This can be {{interpreted}} as mapping the infinite depth binary tree onto this tree and then applying breadth-first search: replace the [...] "down" [...] edges connecting a parent node to its second and later children with [...] "right" [...] edges from the first child to the second child, from the second child to the third child, etc. Thus at each step one <b>can</b> either <b>go</b> <b>down</b> (append a ( [...] , 1) to the end) or go right (add one to the last number) (except the root, which is extra and <b>can</b> only <b>go</b> <b>down),</b> which shows the correspondence between the infinite binary tree and the above numbering; the sum of the entries (minus one) corresponds to the distance from the root, which agrees with the 2n−1 nodes at depth n − 1 in the infinite binary tree (2 corresponds to binary).|$|R
