For our purposes, a direct connection with the business is defined as partner, director or shareholder with 20% {{or more of the}} share capital. The same principle applies where an occupier of a conventionally <b>chargeable</b> <b>asset</b> refuses to grant consent to a charge.|$|E

Capital Gains Tax is a form of tax chargeable on capital gains arising from the disposal of <b>chargeable</b> <b>assets.</b> This paper examines the nature and the justification for Capital Gain Tax as a lucrative ground for raising revenue for development especially in the developing countries. In Nigeria, Capital Gain Tax is yet to yield the desired result in terms of raising revenue for the government. Our theoretical work on this subject explain reasons which includes lack of awareness, inadequate data and the high rate of inflation which has led to high incidence of avoidance of Capital Gain Tax.
