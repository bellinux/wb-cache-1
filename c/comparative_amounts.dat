40|$|This {{paper is}} about the {{emerging}} field of neuroeconomics, which seeks to ground economic theory in details about how the brain works. This approach is a sharp turn in economic thought. Around {{the turn of the}} century, economists made a clear methodological choice, to treat the mind as a black box and ignore its details for the purpose of economic theory (13). In an 1897 letter Pareto wrote It is an empirical fact that the natural sciences have progressed only when they have taken secondary principles as their point of departure, instead of trying to discover the essence of things [...] Pure political economy has therefore a great interest in relying as little as possible on the domain of psychology (quoted in Busino, 1964, p. xxiv (14)). Pareto’s view that psychology should be ignored was reflective of a pessimism of his time, about the ability to ever understand the brain. 1 As William Jevons wrote a little earlier, in 1871 I hesitate to say that men will ever have the means of measuring directly the feelings of the human heart. It is from the quantitative effects of the feelings that we must estimate their <b>comparative</b> <b>amounts</b> (45). This pessimism about understanding the brain led to the popularity of “as if ” rational choice models.

These binding proteins, which are distinct in their physicochemical properties and {{in the mode of}} ligand interactions from the host-tissue retinoid-binding proteins, may be involved in the mediation of the putative biological roles of retinoids in the control of parasitic growth, differentiation and reproduction. Parasite retinol-binding protein and retinoic acid-binding protein exhibited specificity for binding retinol and retinoic acid respectively. Both the binding proteins showed an s 20,w value of 2. 0 S. On gel filtration, both proteins were retarded to a position corresponding to the same molecular size (19. 0 kDa). On preparative columns, the parasite binding proteins exhibited isoelectric points at pH 5. 7 and 5. 75. Unlike the retinoid-binding proteins of mammalian and avian origin, the parasite retinoid-binding proteins showed a lack of mercurial sensitivity in ligand binding. The <b>comparative</b> <b>amounts</b> of retinoic acid-binding protein in five parasites, Onchocerca volvulus, Onchocerca gibsoni, Dipetalonema viteae, Brugia pahangi and Dirofilaria immitis, were between 2. 7 and 3. 1 pmol of retinoic acid bound/mg of extractable protein. However, the levels of parasite retinol-binding protein were between 4. 8 and 5. 8 pmol/mg, which is considerably higher than the corresponding levels of cellular retinol-binding protein of mammalian and avian origin. Both retinol- and retinoic acid-binding-protein levels in O. volvulus-infected human nodules and O. gibsoni-infected bovine nodules were similar to their levels in mammalian tissues.

40|$|This thesis advocates the {{importance}} of representational fluency in physics education. Multiple representations in science (e. g. graphs, words, equations, and diagrams) has been an area of much interest in physics education research in recent years. Representational fluency, however, is a somewhat novel idea. The thesis argues that this little-used term, representational fluency, {{is a way to}} draw together various ideas on how and why the use of multiple representations is important for physics students, educators, and education researchers alike. Representational fluency is investigated by considering three questions: what is representational fluency; what role does representational fluency play in physics learning; and how can students’ development of representational fluency be facilitated? This thesis explores these questions through the format of an introduction, five journal articles, and a general discussion combining the conclusions of each paper. The first paper presents the development, use, and publication of a survey to measure representational fluency, the Representational Fluency Survey (RFS), which is the first of such surveys in the literature. The RFS is a seven item survey which involves the participant solving problems that are difficult due to the representations in the question, rather than the level of physics content knowledge. A second paper illustrates how the RFS is used to further develop our understanding of representational fluency. The RFS allowed diagnosis of significant differences in the levels of representational fluency of different cohorts of students at the University of Sydney and identification of various features of students {{with a high level of}} representational fluency. It was found that the representational fluency of students with a higher level of physics learning experience was significantly greater than that of students with a lower level of physics learning experience and the difference was evident even within the first year cohort. Due to the apparent disparity of levels of representational fluency amongst different cohorts of students at the university, the subsequent three papers relate to research into effective pedagogies that facilitate the development of representational fluency. A format of presenting direct instruction on a particular physics representation through worksheets and consolidating this knowledge with applied questions was trialled as a possible method of instruction. It was found to alter the way that students use representations in following questions. This was done in the context of students in their final year of high school. The format was adapted to suit a university physics course in the structure of a semester-long set of weekly online learning modules designed to introduce students to representations relevant to the upcoming week’s lectures. The uptake and effectiveness of online learning modules was investigated first: it was found that university students were willing to participate in the modules and that the modules were of benefit to student engagement as intended in their design. Therefore, an experiment was conducted with the first year physics students at the University of Sydney. The students were randomly separated into two streams. One stream participated in weekly online learning modules focussed on relevant physics representations, the other stream participated in similar modules which more conventionally focussed on relevant physics concepts. Using the RFS as a pre-post test, it was found that students participating in the modules on physics representations had the largest learning gains in representational fluency. This demonstrates an effective pedagogical tool to support students in developing their representational fluency. Using an established test of conceptual physics understanding, it was also found that the students from each stream of online learning modules developed conceptual physics knowledge by <b>comparative</b> <b>amounts</b> across the semester. In these ways, this thesis advocates {{the importance}} of representational fluency, through defining, diagnosing, and developing representational fluency of university students...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to examine quantitatively the phage {{distribution}} in the atmosphere of a cheesemaking room so as to obtain an overall picture of: phage build-up in the air during the cheesemaking process, the areas where phage was most abundant, and the rate at which phage disappeared. A detailed knowledge of the typical fluctuations of phage in the atmosphere of a cheesemaking room throughout the day should provide a basis for intelligent mitigation of the problem of phage infection in cheesemaking. Several methods for estimating phage in the air were employed. As a rough guide, the well-known sedimentation method of exposure to the air of agar plates spread with the host organism was used throughout the work. Experiments showed that regardless of whether the plates were spread with the host organism shortly before exposure, or held overnight in the refrigerator after being spread, little difference was made to the results. Using another sedimentation method, Petri dishes of peptone-salt solution were exposed to the air. The phage particles in the suspensions were estimated by a plating method. The slit sampler method, where air was drawn over the surface of agar plates spread with the host organism, was used only on some occasions. The most reliable method used was that of filtration of air through calcium alginate wool. In this method a measured volume of air was drawn, by means of a vacuum cleaner motor, through several layers of calcium alginate wool held in a glass tube. The phage which collected in the fibres of the calcium alginate wool was estimated by a plating method. It was at this stage, when developing a suitable method, that grave difficulties were encountered, as the hexametaphosphate solution used for dissolving the calcium alginate apparently sequestered some of the calcium needed for phage proliferation, with the result that plaque counts were adversely affected. Calcium was, therefore, supplied by the addition of CaCl 2 but, when calcium alginate and sodium hexametaphosphate were present during estimations, some calcium combined with phosphate, and this resulted in the production of plates which were cloudy and difficult or impossible to read. After much experimental work with different quantities of agar media and of CaCl 2, and trials with and without phosphate in certain layers, a four-layer method was devised in which calcium was supplied by diffusion to the phage-organism layer, and this gave satisfactorily high counts and plates which could be easily read. Experiments were also carried out to determine a suitable age for the culture used as host in the estimations. During the course of the work it was necessary to prepare the phage aerosols needed for experiments in which the efficiency of the method could be checked. Forcing air through a rubber tube into which phage suspension was injected by means of a hypodermic needle proved to be satisfactory for producing the required aerosol. Investigations of the survival of aerosols were also carried out. Surveys were made at three commercial factories (two mechanized, one non-mechanized) by carrying out sedimentation tests at various places in the cheesemaking room at regular intervals throughout the day. Air filtration counts were also carried out at regular intervals, and the phage content of the whey released during cheesemaking was determined on occasions. Results showed that the phage content of the cheese factory atmosphere depended on the amount of phage development in the milk and whey and the extent to which the whey droplets were dispersed into the air during the cheesemaking operations. The times for maximum distribution of phage were after cheddaring (milling, salting, etc.). The whey separator dispersed large quantities of phage into the air. The majority of aerosolized phage particles normally sedimented fairly rapidly. The unwrapping of cheese bandages on the morning following cheesemaking resulted in extra phage being distributed into the air. The agar plate sedimentation method gave an approximate idea of <b>comparative</b> <b>amounts</b> of phage in the atmosphere. As a result of the various experiments carried out, an overall picture of phage distribution in the air of the cheesemaking room during the cheesemaking process was secured...|$|E

In order to investigate a functional role of surface CD 4 molecules on Th 2 cells during B cell activation, we attempted to establish a CD 4 − variant subclone derived from the CD 4 + MS 202, {{and its effect on}} B cell activation was examined. Briefly, MS 202 was incubated with ethyl methanesulfonate to induce mutation followed by extensive treatment with anti-CD 4 MoAb and complement. MS 1. 1. 2, a representative subclone of resulting cell lines, was shown to lack CD 4 molecules on the cell membrane, although it possessed almost the same amount of surface molecules other than CD 4 compared with the original MS 202 by analysis with flow cytometry. Interestingly, MS 1. 1. 2 induced the maturation of B cells into IgM-producing cells more potently than MS 202.

Background information is provided on the ecological status {{of each of}} these species and after outlining their human use (including commercial use) and management in Australia, an experimental survey method is introduced and results from its application are reported and analysed. The survey method involves two serial surveys of a sample of 204 Brisbane (Australia) residents. The first survey is based on the initial knowledge of the respondents of the reptile species and for the subsequent survey the knowledge available to participants about these species is experimentally increased. These surveys provide information on the amount of knowledge possessed by this sample of the public about the relevant reptile species, the respondents’ attitudes to these species (including their attitudes to commercial use), respondents’ support for the survival of these reptiles and for their conservation. Furthermore, data is gathered from the surveys on the <b>comparative</b> <b>amount</b> respondents’ state they would be prepared to contribute to support the conservation {{of each of these}} focal reptile species. Respondents are asked to assume that they are given $ 1, 000 and that this can only be allocated to the conservation of these reptiles.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{highlight}} {{the importance of}} incorporating the institutional features of local labor markets into the analysis of trade reforms. A trade reform is often deemed beneficial because the elimination of trade barriers allows labor to reallocate toward those sectors in the economy in which the country has a <b>comparative</b> advantage. The <b>amount</b> and speed of the reallocation, however, and the post-reform behavior of output, productivity and welfare, {{will depend on how}} regulated the labor market is. First, I document that high firing costs slow down the intersectoral reallocation of labor after a trade reform. Second, in order to isolate the effect of firing costs on labor reallocation, output, and welfare after a trade reform, I build a dynamic general equilibrium model. I find that if a country does not liberalize its labor market at the outset of its trade reform, the intersectoral reallocation of workers will be 30 % slower and as much as 30 % of the gains in real output and labor productivity in the years following the trade reform will be lost. From a policy standpoint, the message is that while trade reforms are desirable they need to be complemented by labor market reforms in order to be fully successful...|$|R
40|$|The azimuths {{obtained}} from astronomic observation and GPS survey were evaluated to show significant differences. Astronomic observation {{was used in}} azimuth determination for old surveys in the Philippines, but is gradually being replaced {{by the use of}} the GPS, because of its rapid measuring capability and weather independency. However, GPS provides a different type of azimuth as compared to astronomic observation. The relationship and precision of both techniques were tested on various baselines located {{in different parts of the}} country. Nine baselines in five cities from around the Philippine Archipelago were chosen as test sites to compare the difference between the measured GPS azimuth and astronomic azimuth. Dual frequency GPS receivers were used to measure geodetic azimuth using static GPS technique while the astronomic observations made use of series of solar observations using a Wilde T 2 theodolite. The differences in measured azimuth were analyzed and evaluated using the standards of project control accuracy in the Philippines. The results derived from the two methods yielded <b>comparative</b> difference of <b>amounts</b> less than 15 seconds in all test sites, the minimum requirement of PE for tertiary project controls. This means that in the establishment of project controls of at least tertiary control requirements, azimuth from GPS and astronomi...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{distribution}} of conjunctive and prepositional comparative structures in Slovenian. They are introduced by the complementiser kot and the preposition od, respectively. Comparative structures are categorised along three dimensions: (i) the morphological environment of the <b>comparative</b> morpheme (yielding <b>amount</b> and quality comparatives); (ii) the syntactic environment of the comparative morpheme (eight syntactic environments are discussed: (nominative) subject, (accusative) direct object, (dative) indirect object, prepositional object, locative adverbial, temporal adverbial, some other adverbial, and predicate); (iii) the syntactic environment (the same environments as above are discussed) of the associate (the non-elided phrase in the comparative complement is the remnant; its counterpart with the same grammatical function in the matrix clause is the associate). The comparison of conjunctive and prepositional comparatives shows that {{the distribution of the}} latter is more restricted and also exhibits more inter-speaker variation than the former. Conjunctive comparatives are acceptable in virtually all combinations of the above-mentioned parameters, the only exception being quality comparatives withan adverbial or predicate associate where the comparative morpheme is embedded in the associate. The only absolute generalisation that can be made about prepositional comparatives is that the associate must be either a subject or a direct object; all other generalisations are merely tendencies...|$|R
40|$|Oocyte {{developmental}} competence {{depends on}} maternal stores that support development throughout a transcriptionally silent period during early embryogenesis. Previous attempts to investigate transcripts associated with oocyte competence {{have relied on}} prospective models, which are mostly based on morphological. criteria. Using a retrospective model, we quantitatively compared mRNA among oocytes with different embryo development competence. A cytoplasm biopsy was removed from in vitro matured oocytes to perform <b>comparative</b> analysis of <b>amounts</b> of global polyadenylated (polyA) mRNA and housekeeping gene transcripts. After parthenogenetic activation of biopsied oocytes, presumptive zygotes were cultured individually in vitro and oocytes were classified according to embryo development: (i) blocked before the 8 -cell stage; (ii) blocked between the 8 -cell and morulae stages; or (iii) developed to the blastocyst stage. Sham-manipulated controls confirmed that biopsies did not alter development outcome. Total polyA mRNA amounts correlate with oocyte diameter {{but not with the}} ability to develop to the 8 -cell and blastocyst stages. The last was also confirmed by relative quantification of GAPDH, H 2 A and Hprt 1 transcripts. In conclusion, we describe a novel retrospective model to identify putative markers of development competence in single oocytes and demonstrate that global mRNA amounts at the metaphase II stage do not correlate with embryo development in vitro.

40|$|A wind tunnel, {{water-sensitive}} papers (wsp), and DropletScan ® {{software was}} used to collect and compare the movement of spray droplets downwind from 22 different ground sprayer nozzles. The wind tunnel was equipped with a plant canopy and a single nozzle boom to simulate a field application. A constant wind speed of 4. 6 m/s {{was used for the}} test and all nozzles were individually tested with a perpendicular orientation to the wind direction. Each nozzle was tested at a flow rate of 1. 5 liters per minute and a pressure of 276 kPa. Water-sensitive papers were placed at canopy height 1, 2, and 3 meters downwind to collect the spray droplets escaping the spray swath. Percent area coverage for each wsp was generated by DropletScan ® for <b>comparative</b> purposes. High <b>amounts</b> of coverage would support an increased potential for spray drift. At the 1 -meter location, the amount of coverage ranged from a high of 99 percent with traditional flat-fan nozzles to a low of 8 percent with the chamber design turf flood. The venturi nozzles as a group performed best overall with coverage’s ranging from 36 - 9 percent with no significant differences in coverage found between the top seven drift reducing nozzles. The group mean for the venturi nozzles was 20 percent. This is compared to the flat-fan group at 90 percent, the preorifice and chamber nozzles at 42 percent, and the hollow cones at 72 percent. This study supports the use of drift reducing nozzles as a means for minimizing the potential for spray drift...|$|R
40|$|Authors are {{conducting}} {{a series of}} studies to establish the model to estimate the soil moisture in the root zone by using only climatological data obtained at the weather station. In this paper the model is proposed first, and then the characteristics of some components of the model are described. The model proposed here is based on the water balance for a root zone as follows: [numerical formula] where M_n and M_ are the soil moisture on a given day (n day) and n+ 1 day respectively, P_n is the amount of precipitation, ET_n is the evapotranspiration, D_ 2, n is the outgoing surface runoff, P_i, n is the interception and F_ 1, n and F_ 2, n are the capillary rise and the percolation {{at the bottom of the}} root zone respectively. However, F_ 1, n was neglected in this study. On the precipitation in the above equation, it was assumed to be divided as follows: [numerical formula], then [numerical formula] [numerical formula], then [numerical formula] [numerical formula], then [numerical formula] [numerical formula][numerical formula] where P_i, max is the maximum interception, M_f is the field capacity, M_max is the maximum water holding capacity, M_p, n is the soil moisture increased by the precipitation on n day, ρ_s is the apparent specific gravity of the soil, and D is the depth of root zone. The net radiation method was chosen as a reasonable one to estimate the evapotranspiration thought the <b>comparative</b> experiment. The <b>amount</b> of interception increased with the increasing leaf area index, and about 490 f the interception corresponded to the reduction in transpiration. The model represented the soil moisture in the root zone fairly well except for the estimations under the conditions of much soil moisture after a great amount of precipitation. It was expected that differences between the measured and the estimated soil moistures would be reduced by the improvement of the formulas on the partitioning of precipitation. In addition, under the decreasing process of the soil moisture, it was found that the differenc...|$|R
