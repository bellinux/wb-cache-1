5|$|The {{settlements}} at Tilsit gave Napoleon time {{to organize}} his empire. One {{of his major}} objectives became enforcing the Continental System against the British. He decided to focus his attention on the Kingdom of Portugal, which consistently violated his trade prohibitions. After defeat in the War of the Oranges in 1801, Portugal adopted a double-sided policy. At first, John VI agreed to <b>close</b> <b>his</b> ports to British trade. The situation changed dramatically after the Franco-Spanish defeat at Trafalgar; John grew bolder and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} the 23rd, {{the day of the}} speech, brought the reports from the lawyers, who opined that it was legal for a senator to accept expense reimbursements, and from the accountants, who stated that there was no {{evidence}} of misappropriation of money. The Fund was to be dissolved, and gifts accepted since Nixon's nomination were to be accounted for as campaign contributions. Despite the reports, Eisenhower had second thoughts about relying on the success of the speech. He told an aide to call Governor Dewey, who was to call Nixon and instruct him to <b>close</b> <b>his</b> speech with his resignation from the ticket. Believing they had resolved the situation at last, Eisenhower and his staff had a relaxed dinner and began to prepare for his own speech that evening, before 15,000 Republican supporters in Cleveland.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns withdraws a $1000 {{bill from}} an ATM, but he drops it and an updraft carries it {{away to the}} Simpsons' house, where it is found by Bart and Milhouse. Marge makes Bart and Homer put up fliers so {{that the person who}} lost the bill can reclaim it. No one can {{describe}} it correctly so Lisa suggests that they spend the money on a vacation, but then decide against it because Homer always manages to ruin any trip they go on. After realizing he can make money from the bill, Bart displays it in a museum in his tree house. Mr. Burns visits and reclaims his money, forcing Bart to <b>close</b> <b>his</b> museum. However, Bart has made over $3000 from the museum so they decide to spend the money on a vacation for Marge. Abraham Simpson suggests they go to Britain, where he hopes to meet his long-lost love Edwina. During World War II, he made love to her after claiming he was going out to the front lines the next day, not realising that he really was shipping out the next day (D-Day).|$|E

5|$|The inaugural Monaco Grand Prix {{was held}} on 14 April 1929. Caracciola, driving a 7.1-litre Mercedes-Benz SSK, started from the back row of the grid (which was {{allocated}} randomly), and battled Bugatti driver William Grover-Williams for the lead early on. However, his pit stop, which took {{four and a half}} minutes to refill his car with petrol, left him unable to recover the time, and he eventually finished third. He won the RAC Tourist Trophy in slippery conditions, and confirmed his reputation as a specialist in wet track racing. He partnered Werner in the Mille Miglia and Le Mans endurance races in 1930; they finished sixth in the former but were forced to retire after leading for most of the race in the latter after their car's generator burnt out. Caracciola took victory in the 1930 Irish Grand Prix at Phoenix Park, and won four hillclimbs to take the title of European Hillclimb Champion for the first time. However, he was forced to <b>close</b> <b>his</b> dealership in Berlin after the firm went bankrupt.|$|E

Tom returns to the Snakehole Lounge to <b>close</b> <b>his</b> tab, where he meets the bartender, Lucy (Natalie Morales), who makes fun of his efforts to pick up women. The two get along and Lucy gives Tom her phone number, to his immense pleasure. Leslie decides to apologize to Ben, and he invites her out for a beer. As they finally start to get along, Leslie realizes Ben was the mayor {{of a small town}} called Partridge, Minnesota. It was national news because he was only 18 when elected, and he promptly drove the entire government into the ground. Ben became a state auditor to prove he can be responsible and restart his political career. Later, at the parks department budget meeting, Chris and Ben reveal Pawnee's budget crisis was far worse than previously thought and that the Pawnee government will shut down until further notice, horrifying Leslie and delighting Ron.|$|E

His long tenure of office, without parallel in Romanian history, rendered Brătianu extremely unpopular, and at its <b>close</b> <b>his</b> impeachment appeared inevitable.
