5|$|The toll {{collected}} by Autocesta RijekaZagreb {{for use of}} the A6 motorway is not reported separately. Autocesta RijekaZagreb only reports it total toll revenue, including toll revenue collected on the A7 motorway (RupaJurdani section) and the A1 motorway (LučkoBosiljevo2 section) {{as well as on the}} Krk Bridge. In the first half of the 2010 their toll revenue was 188.2 million <b>Croatian</b> <b>kuna</b> (25.3 million euros).|$|E
5|$|The A1 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system integrated with the A6 motorway as the two connect in the Bosiljevo2 interchange forming a unified toll system. Since the two motorways are operated by Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb and Hrvatske autoceste, the toll collection system is operated jointly by the two operators. The toll is payable in <b>Croatian</b> <b>kuna,</b> euro, major credit and debit cards and using a number of prepaid toll collection systems including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operators and ENC – an electronic toll collection (ETC) which is shared at all motorways in Croatia (except the A2 motorway) and provides drivers use of dedicated lanes at toll plazas and a discounted toll rates.|$|E
5|$|The A5 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system. Toll charged along the A5 route between Osijek and the Sredanci interchange depends on the route traveled and ranges from 4.00 kuna (0.54 euro) to 30.00 kuna (4.05 euro) for passenger cars and 13.00 kuna (1.76 euro) to 98.00 kuna (13.24 euro) for semi-trailer trucks.

The latter include smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC, an electronic toll collection system which is used by motorways across Croatia, with discounted rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas. Toll collection systems along the A5 and A3 are unified; vehicles switching from one motorway to the other at Sredanci, for example, do not pass toll plazas at the interchange.|$|E

500|$|The A8 is a {{toll road}} {{based on the}} Croatian vehicle {{classification}} using a ticket system—charging {{for use of the}} motorway based on distance travelled. The system was introduced as a unified toll charge system throughout the Istrian Y motorways in June 2011. Consequently, vehicles using either the A8 or the A9 or switching between the two at the Kanfanar interchange are charged a toll only when they leave the Istrian Y system, no matter where their toll ticket was issued. Along the A8 motorway, a toll is charged only for using the Učka Tunnel and the Kanfanar–Rogovići section; the remaining sections of the motorway are toll-free as of June 2012. Despite this, toll tickets are issued and collected at all exits with toll plazas. For instance, vehicles traveling between Rogovići and Vranja interchanges are issued toll tickets and are required to stop at toll plazas when entering and leaving the A8, but they are not charged for using the route. The toll charge for travelling {{the entire length of the}} motorway ranges from 36.00kuna (...) for passenger cars to 205.00kuna (€27.33) for semi-trailer trucks. The toll can be paid in either <b>Croatian</b> <b>kuna</b> or euros using major credit cards, debit cards and several prepaid toll collection systems, including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC; the last is an electronic toll collection system that is shared between all motorways in Croatia except the A2, providing drivers with discounted toll rates and dedicated lanes at toll plazas.|$|E
