Although various factors such as chemical or physical agents affecting environmental integrity have been considered as possible casuses for the decline, no decisive evidence has ever appeared [2 J. Adult anuran amphibians usually do not drink water orally, but intake it mainly through a part of their ventral skin. We have previously shown that Japanese tree-frogs show sexual dimorphism in water absorption in the ventral skin. We examined the influence of an insecticide, methoxychlor, which has been known as an endodrine disruptor in modifying sexual integrity of animals, on the <b>cutaneous</b> water <b>absorption</b> of Japanese tree-frogs. After being kept for one month in water containing methoxychlor, male tree-frogs showed apparent depression of the <b>cutaneous</b> water <b>absorption</b> rate at concentration of 10 - 6 M or higher, but the agent had no effects on the females up to 10 - 5 M. When frogs were brought into a dehydrated environment after being kept in water containing methoxychlor for one month, all animals, males and females, showed a marked depression of the water absorption rate even at a low concentration of 10 - 9 M. These results suggest one possible reason for the severe decline in the amphibian population during 1960 s when the agent had been widely used [3 J, may be due to disability of the water absorption caused by the endocrine disruptors...|$|R

40|$|The skin is a {{remarkable}} barrier, protecting us from invasion of e. g. harmful microorganisms and UV-radiation. However, the skin is not adopted to resist repeated exposure to the multitude of xenobiotics introduced into modern society. Some of these chemicals are skin sensitizers, and exposure {{can lead to the}} development of contact allergy. Contact allergy has significant social and economic consequences, both for the individual and for society. It is therefore important to prevent sensitization. The skin also constitutes a potential route for administration of drugs, and much effort is put into the development of cutaneous and transdermal drug delivery systems. The work of this thesis aims to improve the understanding of processes related to the interactions between the skin and topically applied compounds, i. e. drugs and skin sensitizers. Specifically, two-photon microscopy has been used to study the <b>cutaneous</b> <b>absorption</b> and distribution of model drugs and a series of model skin sensitizers. Improved <b>cutaneous</b> <b>absorption</b> was demonstrated using formulations composed of lipid cubic phases. The work also showed elevated sensitization potency of haptens depending on delivery vehicles. Putative mechanistic explanations for the observed effects have been proposed. Specifically, phthalates were shown to increase the sensitization potency of isothiocyanates. The phthalate-induced effect could be linked to a PSU-targeted delivery of the haptens into the skin. It could also be shown that vehicles alter hapten reactivity to stratum corneum proteins leading to variations in sensitization potency. Moreover, hapten protein targets in skin have been identified using caged fluorescent model hapten. Specifically, basal cell keratinocytes and the keratins were identified as specific hapten targets in the skin. In conclusion, the work presented in this thesis contributes to the general understanding of the mechanisms involved in the <b>cutaneous</b> <b>absorption</b> of topically applied drugs and skin sensitizers.

40|$|The {{specialised}} {{nature of}} the stratum corneum makes it an efficient barrier to foreign substances, including drug molecules. Therefore, <b>cutaneous</b> drug <b>absorption</b> is a slow and complex process of which stratum corneum penetration is the rate limiting step. The rate and extent of stratum corneum penetration by a drug compound depends greatly {{on the presence of}} penetration enhancing/retarding excipients and therefore the clinical outcomes of a product rely greatly on the components and quality of the formulation. Hence, establishing bioequivalence between topical products is crucial to ensure that patients receiving multisource drug products are assured of the same efficacy and safety as the brand product. Since locally acting topical formulations do not target the systemic circulation, conventional methods of assessing bioequivalence using plasma levels are not appropriate. Consequently, the current regulatory guidelines require comparative clinical trials to be carried out to show bioequivalence between topical products. As these studies are very expensive and time consuming, the development of a more direct and relatively rapid and inexpensive method for determining bioequivalence between topical products is required. Clotrimazole is an anti-fungal agent where the target site of action is in the stratum corneum. In this work, tape stripping, which involves the sampling of stratum corneum, was investigated as a tool for the determination of bioequivalence between topical clotrimazole products. The tape stripping method involved the analysis of each tape strip individually and standardization of stratum corneum thickness between subjects was carried out using TEWL measurements. This approach provided detailed information regarding the amount of clotrimazole present in the stratum corneum as well as the extent of drug penetration. Prior to the tape stripping studies an HPLC method was developed for the quantitative analysis of clotrimazole from the tape strip samples. This method was shown to be accurate and reproducible across the required range. It was also shown to be selective for clotrimazole in the presence of possible interfering substances such as those present in the tape adhesive and also skin components. The bioequivalence studies were conducted using a single “uptake” time point. In order to determine an appropriate dose duration for these studies a novel approach was employed, involving a preliminary dose duration study. For the bioequivalence investigations, Canesten® Topical cream was used as both test and reference products to determine if the method was capable of showing bioequivalence. Subsequently, Canesten® Topical cream was also compared to a 1 % gel formulation to determine if the method could detect formulation differences. The conventional BE limits of 0. 8 – 1. 25 were used for the assessment of BE, however, the clinical relevance of using these limits for dermal studies is debatable since they are derived from oral pharmacokinetic studies. Therefore, the data from the tape stripping investigations were also assessed using more realistic limits of 0. 75 – 1. 33 and even 0. 7 – 1. 44. In addition to the tape stripping studies a novel method of determining the amount of drug present in the stratum corneum, the “Residual Method”, was investigated. This method involved assaying the amount of clotrimazole found in the residual formulation after a specified dose duration had elapsed and subtracting that amount from the amount of clotrimazole initially applied. The results of tape stripping investigations showed that, if the study is sufficiently powered, tape stripping may be used to determine bioequivalence according to the conventional limits, as well as possibly detect formulation differences between different clotrimazole products. Bioequivalence assessment using the widened intervals showed that fewer subjects were required to achieve a sufficient statistical power. The variability associated with this method was acceptable and tape stripping may therefore have the potential {{to be used as a}} BE tool in a regulatory setting for clotrimazole or other antifungal topical formulations. The “Residual Method” also showed promising results as a bioequivalence tool, but further investigation and extensive validation of this method is required before it can be suggested as a regulatory method. The results of these studies have clearly indicated that tape stripping has the potential to be used as an alternative to comparative clinical trails for the assessment of bioequivalence between clotrimazole formulations and also to assess bioequivalence between other antifungal products...|$|R

30|$|The {{accumulation}} of metals in the earthworm tissues {{might be the}} reason for reduction of leachable concentration of metals during vermicomposting of S. natans. Similar results were also reported by Jain et al. (2004) and Singh and Kalamdhad (2013). The evidence of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>absorption</b> of metals by earthworms was reported by Suthar (2009). The leachability of metals might have also reduced due to increase in pH and complexity of metal humic substances. An increase in the pH of vermicompost resulted in an increase of surface negative charge, which increased cationic adsorption, formation of metal hydroxyl species that have a greater affinity for adsorption sites than the metal cations, and precipitation of metal as metal hydroxides (Maity et al. 2008). Another reason for the reduction of leachable metal concentration during vermicomposting was the affinity of the metals with the functional groups –OH or –COO– of humic substances of the vermicompost (Kang et al. 2011). The threshold limits for heavy metal contamination are 20  mg/kg for Cd, 100  mg/kg for Cr and 100  mg/kg for Pb (US EPA method 1311, 1992).

40|$|An {{overview}} of agents causing hypopigmentation in human skin is presented. The review is organized {{to put forward}} groups of biological and chemical agents. Their mechanisms of action cover (i) tyrosinase inhibition, maturation and enhancement of its degradation; (ii) Mitf inhibition; (iii) downregulation of MC 1 R activity; (iv) interference with melanosome maturation and transfer; (v) melanocyte loss, desquamation and chemical peeling. Tyrosinase inhibition {{is the most common}} approach to achieve skin hypopigmentation as this enzyme catalyses the rate-limiting step of pigmentation. Despite the large number of tyrosinase inhibitors in vitro, only a few are able to induce effects in clinical trials. The gap between in-vitro and in-vivo studies suggests that innovative strategies are needed for validating their efficacy and safety. Successful treatments need the combination of two or more agents acting on different mechanisms to achieve a synergistic effect.

However, there is still a lack of toxicological data related to nano-structured palladium and information on human <b>cutaneous</b> <b>absorption.</b> In fact, PdNPs, can be absorbed through the skin in higher amounts than bulk Pd because NPs can release more ions. In our study, we evaluated the absorption of PdNPs, with a size of 10. 7 ± 2. 8 nm, using intact and damaged human skin in Franz cells. 0. 60 mg cm- 2 of PdNPs were applied on skin surface for 24 h. Pd concentrations in the receiving solutions at the end of experiments were 0. 098 ± 0. 067 μg cm- 2 and 1. 06 ± 0. 44 μg cm- 2 in intact skin and damaged skin, respectively. Pd flux permeation after 24 h was 0. 005 ± 0. 003 μg cm- 2 h- 1 and 0. 057 ± 0. 030 μg cm- 2 h- 1 and lag time 4. 8 ± 1. 7 and 4. 2 ± 3. 6 h, for intact and damaged skin respectively. This study indicates that Pd can penetrate human skin...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Nonylphenol (NP) {{is present}} ubiquitously in both aquatic and {{terrestrial}} environments. This compound {{is considered an}} important endocrine disruptor and its toxic/oestrogenic activity has been investigated {{in a number of}} in vitro and in vivo studies. Human exposure to NP may occur by <b>cutaneous</b> <b>absorption,</b> ingestion of contaminated food or water and inhalation. Moreover, while the cytotoxic effects of NP are known and studied, its effects on cell death and related mechanisms are not known. Our group decided to investigate NP effects on a gastric epithelial cell line (AGS), in particular NP effects on AGS cell cycle and apoptosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell cycle was analysed by flow cytometry, p 21 and p 27 induction, and apoptosis was analysed by flow cytometry and annexin-V assays, Fas, Fas-L, caspase 8 and caspase 3 activation. RESULTS: We have demonstrated that NP affected cell cycle and apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner, reaching the most notable effect at concentration of 10 (- 7) m, for 48 h. Flow cytometry revealed that treatment with 10 (- 7) m NP led to accumulation of cells at G(2) /M transition and increased percentage population of apoptotic cells. Results have shown that NP at concentration 10 (- 7) m induced marked increase in Fas and Fas-L expression. Moreover, 10 (7) m NP induced activation of caspases 8 and 3, but not activation of caspase 9. CONCLUSIONS: The results reported suggest that gastric cells can be useful as screening population for appropriate study of developmental toxicity...|$|E

Nearly 3. 5 % {{of the population has}} been diagnosed to have psoriasis. In a dermatology department, almost one-third of psoriasis patients are in the pediatric age group. With an annual prevalence of up to 0. 71 %, childhood psoriasis can now be regarded as a frequently seen chronic inflammatory skin disorder having {{a significant impact on the}} quality of life. Based on the age of onset, psoriasis in children can be broadly classified as infantile psoriasis that can be mostly self-limited, psoriasis having an early onset, which needs specific treatment, and psoriasis that is associated with arthritis. Treating a child with psoriasis is a challenge, considering the physical development, body metabolism, rate of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>absorption,</b> and metabolism of drugs, which are quite different from those of the adults. The long duration of sun exposure for the rest of their life makes it more demanding while considering phototherapy in children. Long-term treatment of psoriasis, with phototherapy or drugs, needs critical evaluation in children. Hence, a thorough understanding of the disease in all its aspects will certainly help manage childhood psoriasis better. Timely diagnosis and adequate management not only arrest progression but also minimize the psychological burden caused by the disease, averting disfiguring states and evolution into a metabolic syndrome.

40|$|Thermal {{stress can}} have a {{profound}} impact on the physiological responses that are elicited following environmental toxicant exposure. The efficacy by which toxicants enter the body is directly influenced by thermoregulatory effector responses that are evoked in response to high ambient temperatures. In mammals, the thermoregulatory response to heat stress consists of an increase in skin blood flow and moistening of the skin surface to dissipate core heat to the environment. These physiological responses may exacerbate chemical toxicity due to increased permeability of the skin, which facilitates the <b>cutaneous</b> <b>absorption</b> of many environmental toxicants. The core temperature responses that are elicited in response to high ambient temperatures, toxicant exposure or both can also have {{a profound impact on}} the ability of an organism to survive the insult. In small rodents, the thermoregulatory response to thermal stress and many environmental toxicants (such as organophosphate compounds) is often biphasic in nature, consisting initially of a regulated reduction in core temperature (i. e., hypothermia) followed by fever. Hypothermia is an important thermoregulatory survival strategy that is used by small rodents to diminish the effect of severe environmental insults on tissue homeostasis. The protective effect of hypothermia is realized by its effects on chemical toxicity as molecular and cellular processes, such as lipid peroxidation and the formation of reactive oxygen species, are minimized at reduced core temperatures. The beneficial effects of fever are unknown under these conditions. Perspective is provided on the applicability of data obtained in rodent models to the human condition.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the skin distribution of fluconazole, a water-soluble antifungal agent, following intravenous (i. v.) and topical administration in the awake freely moving rat. Following i. v. bolus injection of fluconazole (10 mg/kg), a dual-site microdialysis sampling was performed in jugular vein and dermis in five rats. In addition, <b>cutaneous</b> <b>absorption</b> was studied by dermal microdialysis sampling following topical application of Diflucan Gel 0. 5 % to 12 rats. Fluconazole microdialysate concentrations were measured by on-line HPLC. To calibrate in vivo the probes, a fluorinated analog (UK- 54737) of fluconazole was used as retrodialysis marker after demonstrating that recoveries were no different. Following i. v. bolus injection, fluconazole rapidly penetrates into the dermis. Cutaneous microdialysis sampling provided dermal concentrations of fluconazole, which were very similar to the unbound plasma concentrations determined by vascular microdialysis. The distribution equilibrium was rapidly achieved with a dermis-to-plasma partition coefficient of 1. 02 +/- 0. 04 (n= 5). Following topical application of 0. 5 g of Diflucan Gel containing 0. 5 % of fluconazole, active unbound concentrations in dermis were measured by cutaneous microdialysis for 11 h after application. The area under the curve (AUC) of fluconazole in dermal dialysate was relatively constant to an implantation depth of approximately 350 microm. Below this depth, the AUC progressively decreased with increasing implantation depth of the probe. Finally, this study shows that cutaneous microdialysis is an effective and minimally invasive tool to evaluate the dermal pharmacokinetics of fluconazole following intravenous or topical administration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Inadequate {{radiation}} or insufficient <b>cutaneous</b> <b>absorption</b> of UVB {{is one of}} {{the cardinal}} causes of vitamin D deficiency. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine whether air pollution and low ground level of ultra-violet B light (UVB; 290 - 315) can deteriorate the body vitamin D status in healthy women. Methods In this cross sectional study 200, free-living, housewives, aged between 20 to 55 years, from Tehran (high polluted area) and Ghazvin (low polluted area) were included. The Tehranian women were selected randomly from participants of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) and the Ghazvinian females from patients who came to public health centers. Participants were excluded for disease and drugs which affect vitamin D status and also if they were pregnant or breast feeding. We measured the ground level of UVB using a Haze meter as a surrogate of air pollution. In order to calculate the adjusted mean difference of 25 -OH-D, ANCOVA analysis was used. Moreover, Binary logistic regression model was developed to determine the odds of living in Tehran for having serum 25 -OH-D less than 20 ng/ml. Results The mean ± SD of serum 25 -OH-D was significantly higher in Ghazvinian women ((18 ± 11 vs. 13 ± 7), P-value vs. 31 % and 32 % in respectively). Secondary hyperparathyroidism was also significantly higher in Tehranian women (47 % vs. 32 %). In ANCOVA analysis, after adjustment, the mean of 25 -OH-D in the Ghazvinian group was still statistically significantly higher than Tehranians (13 vs. 17 ng/ml P-value = 0. 04). In addition, in binary logistic model, the odd of living in Tehran for having serum 25 -OH-D less than 20 ng/ml was 5. 22 (95 % confidence interval 2. 2 - 12. 2, P-value Conclusion We found that living in a polluted area plays a significant independent role in vitamin D deficiency and hence, residence can be one of the main reasons of vitamin D status of the women. </p...|$|E
