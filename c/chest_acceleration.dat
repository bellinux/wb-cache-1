40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} whether delta-V can be modified with a measure of vehicle structure performance and occupant restraint performance to better predict occupant peak <b>chest</b> <b>acceleration</b> during a frontal crash. A total of 619 full-scale frontal crash tests, with impact speeds ranging from 14 to 42 mph, were analyzed. Multiple linear regression was used to correlate combinations of crash severity, vehicle structure performance, and occupant restraint performance descriptors to the maximum measured crash test dummy <b>chest</b> <b>acceleration.</b> Using an adjusted R 2 selection method, the best combination of metrics were selected and then compared to a baseline model that used only delta-V to predict occupant chest kinematics.

40|$|To {{minimize}} occupant injuries, passive in-vehicle {{safety systems}} like the safety belt and the airbag restrain the occupant during a crash. This paper presents a design approach for a feedback controller for the belt force {{to reduce the}} maximum <b>chest</b> <b>acceleration</b> as a measure for the risk of occupant injuries. Only frontal crashes are considered. The available, experimentally validated numerical crash model is too complex {{to be used as}} a controller design model. Therefore, approximate linear models for the transfer from belt force to <b>chest</b> <b>acceleration</b> are derived by analysing the effect of stepwise perturbations of the belt force on the <b>chest</b> <b>acceleration.</b> Using these linear models, loop shaping is applied to arrive at a controller that satisfies a set of a priori defined criteria. The controller is implemented in and evaluated with the complex crash model, showing that a reduction of approximately 60 per cent in the adopted injury measure can be achieved. Furthermore, it is shown that this approach can be applied in different situations...|$|E
40|$|Restrained {{driver and}} right-front {{passenger}} kinematics and injury outcome in frontal collisions are compared using FARS data and human cadaver sled tests. The FARS {{data indicate that}} a frontal airbag may provide greater benefit for a passenger than for a driver. The thoracic injuries sustained by passenger subjects restrained by a force-limited, pretensioned belt and airbag are evaluated, and kinematics are compared to driver-side subjects. The injury-predictive ability of existing thoracic injury criteria is evaluated for passenger-side occupants. Driver and passenger kinematic differences are identified and the implications are discussed. The <b>chest</b> <b>acceleration</b> of the passenger-side subjects exhibited a bimodal profile with an initial (and global) maximum before the subject loaded the airbag.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{quantitative}} study is to investigate the differences of the injury mechanism caused by {{two different types of}} seatbelt loads on the occupant’s chest. Methods: The finite element analysis is employed to compare the different responses of the human body model, including comparison of kinematics, <b>chest</b> <b>accelerations,</b> seatbelt forces and chest injury outcomes regarding chest deflections and rib fractures. Results: The calculated rib strain-stress response from simulations in force-limiting seatbelt are higher than that in the regular seatbelt. The forward movement and torso twist are both great in simulations with force-limiting seatbelt. Moreover, there are obvious differences in the injury outcomes of chest deflections and rib fracture risks under the different seatbelt loads. Conclusion: Results indicate that the chest deflections and rib fracture risks are negatively correlated under the load of the force-limiting seatbelt, However, they are positively correlated to and determined by the seatbelt peak load of the regular seatbelt.

The full scale test selected {{for this study}} is a 30 mph frontal impact of a 1993 Ford Taurus vehicle into a rigid flat wall. Finite element models of a Ford Taurus vehicle, a Hybrid III dummy, and a driver side airbag were combined to simulate the test. The vehicle, dummy, and airbag models are described in detail.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} ability of the Hybrid III dummy and its {{associated}} injury criteria to discriminate sled tests with injurious conditions from those without. Ninety-three matched human cadaver and Hybrid III frontal sled tests over a range of impact speeds and restraint conditions are considered. <b>Chest</b> <b>acceleration,</b> deflection, and CTI are used as predictors of rib fracture outcome in the matched cadaver tests. Univariate and multivariate models are developed to evaluate the importance of the dummy measures relative to three experimental parameters (test speed, restraint condition, seating position) and three cadaver characteristics (age, gender, mass). The primary findings are, first, that <b>chest</b> <b>acceleration</b> has no utility for injury discrimination (Kruskal’s Gamma = 0. 0319, area under the receiver-operator characteristic = 0. 500). Second, the functional relationship between any Hybrid III injury measure and injury risk is sensitive to all three experimental factors. Injury risk models with consideration of this dependence are presented. It is shown that the Hybrid-III chest deflection corresponding to a given level of injury risk is greatest for air bag loading, lowest for belt loading, and intermediate for combined loading. This is shown to be non-biofidelic, since chest deflection as measured directly on the cadaver does not exhibit this sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|The vehicle {{safety and}} {{roadside}} safety communities utilize full-scale crash tests {{to assess the}} potential for occupant injury during collision loadings. While the vehicle community uses instrumented full-scale crash test dummies (ATDs), the roadside community relies on the flail space model and the Acceleration Severity Index (ASI) models, which are based primarily on the deceleration of the test vehicle. Unfortunately, {{there has been little}} research relating the roadside injury criteria to those used in the vehicle community. This paper investigates the correlation of these differing metrics to gain insight to potential differences in threshold occupant risk levels in the roadside and vehicle safety communities. Full-scale vehicle crash tests are analyzed to compare the flail space model and ASI to ATD-based injury criteria for different impact configurations, including frontal and frontal offset crash tests. The Head Injury Criterion (HIC), peak <b>chest</b> <b>acceleration,</b> peak chest deflection, and maximum femur force are each compared to the ASI, and flail space parameters. With respect to the vehicle crash test injury criteria, the occupant impact velocity and ASI are found to be conservative in the frontal collision mode.

40|$|A {{series of}} sled tests was {{performed}} to analyze the responses of an anthropomorphic test device (ATD), particularly neck forces, when rear-facing child restraint systems (CRS) are tethered. Nominally identical rear-facing CRS were tested in four tether conditions: untethered, tethered down to the floor, tethered {{down to the bottom}} of the vehicle seat, and tethered rearward to a point above the back of the vehicle seat. The CRABI 12 MO ATD with head, upper neck, and chest instrumentation was used in all tests. The tests were conducted using the ECE R 44. 02 test bench. Both frontal and rear impacts were performed and each condition was repeated for a total of 16 sled tests. Motions of the CRS and ATD were recorded using high-speed digital video (1000 fps). The highest ATD accelerations, forces, and moments were observed during the primary impact of a frontal test, rather than on rebound. The loads observed during rebound from frontal impact were similar in magnitude to the peak loads collected during rear impact. The four tethering geometries produced distinct loading patterns. The lowest HIC, neck forces, and <b>chest</b> <b>accelerations</b> in both impact directions were observed with the rearward tether. The upper neck moment data did not show a clear trend relative to tethering geometry. ATD and CRS motions were best controlled in frontal impact by the rearward tethering geometry while the motions in rear impact were best controlled by tethering to the floor.

40|$|The {{scope of}} our work focuses on {{investigating}} the potential use of the built-in accelerometer of the smartphones for the recording of the respiratory activity and deriving the respiratory rate. Five healthy subjects performed an inspiratory load protocol. The excursion of the right chest was recorded using the built-in triaxial accelerometer of a smartphone along the x, y and z axes and with an external uniaxial accelerometer. Simultaneously, the respiratory airflow and the inspiratory mouth pressure were recorded, as reference respiratory signals. The <b>chest</b> <b>acceleration</b> signal recorded in the z axis with the smartphone was denoised using a scheme based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition, a noise data assisted method which decomposes nonstationary and nonlinear signals into intrinsic mode functions. To distinguish noisy oscillatory modes from the relevant modes we use the detrended fluctuation analysis. We reported a very strong correlation between the acceleration of the z axis of the smartphone and the reference accelerometer across the inspiratory load protocol (from 0. 80 to 0. 97). Furthermore, {{the evaluation of the}} respiratory rate showed a very strong correlation (0. 98). A good agreement was observed between the respiratory rate estimated with the <b>chest</b> <b>acceleration</b> signal from the z axis of the smartphone and with the respiratory airflow signal: Bland-Altman limits of agreement between - 1. 44 and 1. 46 breaths per minute with a mean bias of - 0. 01 breaths per minute.

Experimental sled tests were completed following {{the requirements of the}} Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 213 using a Hybrid III 3 -year-old dummy in a forward facing configuration restrained in a child restraint system (CRS) that employed a five-point seat belt. The Hybrid III 3 -year-old dummy was equipped with three uniaxial accelerometers arranged in mutually perpendicular directions in the head and chest. Experimental sled tests were also completed for a rearward facing configuration, but the results were not applicable due to excessive rotation of the child safety seat {{toward the front of the}} sled which would not typically occur in a frontal crash. In addition the set-up did not allow for proper placement of the child dummy 2 ̆ 7 s legs and did not portray a realistic configuration of the child in the child safety seat. Using Finite Element Model Builder (FEMB) software and EASi-Crash Dyna, a numerical model employing a subset of the apparatus used in the forward facing experimental sled test was developed and numerically simulated using LS-DYNA. To verify the numerical simulations, the head and <b>chest</b> <b>accelerations</b> were compared to the experimental observations and it was found that there was a reasonable engineering correlation between the data.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringSignificant advancements in {{enhancing}} passenger safety and vehicle structures {{have been made}} in the automotive industry to protect the occupants and to minimize the injuries during crash events. Variety of crash tests, based on federal regulatory standards, have been performed with an end goal to examine the occupant kinematics and potential injury responses. Among different automotive crash scenarios, the frontal impact is the most common type of accident, which has been considered in this study. In recent years, computer-aided engineering tools have been extensively utilized in modeling, analysis and design of vehicle structures and occupant safety systems. The primary reason for the development and use of simulation models is to reduce the number of full-scale sled tests performed, which require vast flow time and are associated with significant cost. This thesis entirely focuses on the comparison of dynamic responses of human body models versus the crash dummy models in various vehicle frontal federal regulatory standards. For this reason, a ford taurus car representing a typical sedan has been considered as a medium. The simulation tests are conducted for the full frontal impact, small offset overlap impact and oblique impact configurations. A car interior environment is developed in MADYMO code, in which the human and dummy models are placed in. The acceleration acquired from the finite element analysis of frontal crash scenarios and the driver seat node are then input into the MADYMO code for both human and dummy models, and their kinematic responses are then compared. Per regulations, chest injury is considered to be a prominent factor in frontal crashes. Hence, the variations of chest deflection, <b>chest</b> <b>acceleration</b> and viscous criteria are investigated. The results from this study illustrate the potential difference between the human and dummy dynamic performances in various frontal crash scenarios. In particular, the differences in <b>chest</b> <b>acceleration,</b> chest deflection, and flexibility of spine are quantified...|$|E

Recently, several studies have reported cases of abdominal injuries in booster seated children questioning the protective effects of these restraints. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine cases of abdominal injuries in booster seated children through parametric modeling to gain a thorough understanding of the injury causation scenarios. The Partners for Child Passenger Safety and CIREN in-depth crash investigation databases were queried to identify children in belt-positioning booster seats with abdominal injuries. The injury causation scenarios for these injuries were delineated using the CIREN Biotab method. The cases were modeled, using MADYMO with variations in key parameters, to determine the ranges of loads and loading rates for the abdomen and thorax. A parametric study was completed examining the influence of pretensioners and load limiters on the injury metrics obtained. Query of the two databases revealed three cases involving abdominal injuries to booster seated children. Children in two of the cases sustained a thoracic injury (AIS 3 /AIS 4) in addition to their abdominal injuries (AIS 2) and review of these cases pointed to the role of shoulder belt loading in the injury causation. Modeling of these cases revealed <b>chest</b> compressions and <b>accelerations</b> of 30 – 53 mm and 41 – 89 g, respectively and abdominal deflection and velocity of 7. 0 – 13. 3 mm and 1. 2 – 2. 2 m/s, respectively.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effects by crash related car parameters on head and chest injury measures for 3 - and 12 -year-old children in near side impacts. Methods: The evaluation was made by using a model of a complete passenger car which was impacted laterally by a barrier. The car model was validated in two crash conditions: the IIHS and the USNCAP side impact tests. The SID-IIs and the HBM 3 (THUMS 3 -yo) finite element models were used for the parametric investigation (HBM 3 on a booster). The car parameters were: vehicle mass, side impact structure stiffness, a head airbag, a thorax-pelvis airbag, and a seat belt with pretensioner. The studied dependent variables were: resultant head linear acceleration, resultant head rotational <b>acceleration,</b> <b>chest</b> viscous criterion, rib deflection, and relative velocity at head impact. The chest measurements were only considered for the SID-IIs. Results: The head airbag had the greatest effect on the head measurements for both of the occupant models. On average, it reduced the peak head linear acceleration by 54 g for the HBM 3 and 78 g for the SID-IIs. The seat belt had the second greatest effect on the head measurements; the peak head linear accelerations were reduced on average by 39 g (HBM 3) and 44 g (SID-IIs). The high stiffness side structure increased the SID-IIs head acceleration, while it had marginal effect on the HBM 3. The vehicle mass had marginal effect on SID-IIs head accelerations, while the lower vehicle mass caused 18 g higher head acceleration for HBM 3 and the greatest rotational acceleration. The thorax-pelvis airbag, the vehicle mass and the seat belt pretensioner affected the chest measurements the most. The presence of a thorax-pelvis airbag, high vehicle mass and a seat belt pretensioner all reduced the chest VC and peak rib deflection in the SID-IIs. Conclusions: The head and thorax-pelvis airbags have the potential to reduce injury measurements for both the SID-IIs and the HBM 3, provided that the airbag properties are designed to consider these occupant sizes also. The seat belt pretensioner is also effective, provided that the lateral translation of the torso is managed by other features. The importance of lateral movement management is greater the smaller the occupant is.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} and propose improvements to the injury mitigation systems, in near-side impacts, for 6 common sitting positions of young adolescents using a previously validated model. Methods: The evaluation was made by using a model of a complete passenger car, including head and thorax–pelvis air bags, which was impacted laterally by a barrier in 2 load cases. The SID-IIs finite element model was used for the evaluations and was seated in 6 different positions in the rear outboard seat: the nominal anthropomorphic test device (ATD) position, 1 inboard position, 3 outboard positions, and 1 braking (forward) position. These positions have previously been identified as common sitting positions in awake and asleep children. The studied dependent variables were head injury criterion (HIC) 36, resultant head linear acceleration, resultant head rotational <b>acceleration,</b> <b>chest</b> viscous criterion, and chest deflection. Results: The lowest head injury measures were seen in the braking positions and in the nominal ATD position, and the highest were seen in the inboard and outboard positions. The lowest chest injury measures were recorded in the inboard and nominal ATD positions, and the highest were recorded in the outboard and braking positions. The occupant in the outboard positions interfered with the air bags during their deployment. The occupant in inboard and braking positions tended to push the curtain air bag over the windowsill. Conclusions: Studies that investigate the injury mitigation effects in common sitting positions, beyond the nominal ATD position, are essential to highlight means to provide improved and robust safety for child occupants. This study was based on the SID-IIs 5 th percentile female, which has very similar anthropometry to a 50 th percentile 12 -year-old. Therefore, the conclusions of this study are applicable to many 11 -year-olds up to young adolescents, as well as to small females. The outboard and inboard positions of this study resulted in the highest head injury measures. Although all of the injury measures were only slightly higher than the nominal position, the trends suggest that, in near-side impacts, these positions should be discouraged. The extensively outboard positions resulted in unfavorable air bag positioning during deployment. The inboard position resulted in head strikes further forward of the nominal one; the curtain air bags need inflated cells at all locations of head strike...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is {{emphasized}} on searching for the ergonomic child safety seating design to reduce the neck injuries during forward car collision. The new designed prototype of ergonomic safety seat, featuring with two cushions under the seat, buffering device in the back-rest support and lowery placing the child restrain belt through the rear side of the seat, is suitable for the use of those children with weight ranging from 9 to 18 kilograms. The forward car collision experiment was performed in National Vehicle Research Center. Results of the collision experiment show that the new designed ergonomic safety seat can decrease by 30. 19 percent, comparing with the national standard value, in the portion of head acceleration and also can decrease by 12. 34 percent in the portion of <b>chest</b> <b>acceleration</b> under the conditions of standard impact velocity and maximum simulated car acceleration. The collision experiment also reveals that the new ergonomic designed seat can obviously eliminate the acceleration value in comparison with the conventional standard safety seat in the areas of dummy child’s head, neck and chest according to the real dynamic impact detection reports...|$|E
40|$|Background. Cardiopulmonary {{resuscitation}} (CPR) feedback {{devices are}} being increasingly used. However, current accelerometer-based devices overestimate chest displacement when CPR is performed on soft surfaces, which {{may lead to}} insufficient compression depth. Aim. To assess {{the performance of a}} new algorithm for measuring compression depth and rate based on two accelerometers in a simulated resuscitation scenario. Materials and Methods. Compressions were provided to a manikin on two mattresses, foam and sprung, with and without a backboard. One accelerometer was placed on the chest and the second at the manikin’s back. Chest displacement and mattress displacement were calculated from the spectral analysis of the corresponding acceleration every 2 seconds and subtracted to compute the actual sternal-spinal displacement. Compression rate was obtained from the <b>chest</b> <b>acceleration.</b> Results. Median unsigned error in depth was 2. 1 [*]mm (4. 4 %). Error was 2. 4 [*]mm in the foam and 1. 7 [*]mm in the sprung mattress (p< 0. 001). Error was 3. 1 / 2. 0 [*]mm and 1. 8 / 1. 6 [*]mm with/without backboard for foam and sprung, respectively (p< 0. 001). Median error in rate was 0. 9 [*]cpm (1. 0 %), with no significant differences between test conditions. Conclusion. The system provided accurate feedback on chest compression depth and rate on soft surfaces. Our solution compensated mattress displacement, avoiding overestimation of compression depth when CPR is performed on soft surfaces...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the design of the Hybrid III dummy's hip joint can cause high spikes in the chest accelerations. These spikes are {{generated}} when the pelvis rotation is suddenly stopped by the bottoming out of the hip joint. This creates large lumbar shear and tension forces which act to resist forward movement of the dummy's chest. This problem has partly been resolved by the introduction of 'modified femurs'. However, even with modified femurs, high peaks have still been observed in chest accelerations of some front barrier crashes. In order to analyze the load path from upper legs to chest, dynamic experiments have been performed on the hip joint (with modified femurs and with standard femurs), on the isolated lumbar spine and on a partial dummy consisting of upper legs, torso, neck and head. These tests have been used to significantly improve an existing model of the dummy. In the hip joint, a considerable rate-dependency was found and the adjustment of hip friction was found to be an important factor. For different lumbar spines from the same manufacturer, major differences in response were found. These differences between dummy parts are a concern for reproducibility of full dummy tests. A sensitivity analysis showed that such dummy related factors lead to variations in the order of 2 - 8 % for peak <b>chest</b> <b>acceleration</b> and chest deflection, but lead to much larger variations in lumbar loads...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to validate a mathematical simulation model of the Q 3 ATD in an integrated forward-facing booster-type restraint in the rear seat and to evaluate restraint parameters to further develop design guidelines for this type of restraint system for forward facing children corresponding {{to the size of the}} Q 3. Only frontal impact was considered. Methods: The software MADYMO was used to create and run the model of the restraint system and model of the child. The restraint system consisted of a seat and a safety belt. The child dummy model was the Q 3. The complete model was validated to sled tests on 12 response signals: displacements of the dummy model, safety belt forces, and dummy model accelerations. The method used in the evaluation of the restraint parameters was a factorial design of experiments (DOE). The study included a total of 9 parameters: 6 related to the safety belt, such as pretensioner, load limiter, and belt anchor positions; two parameters related to the seat (stiffness and pitch angle); and one related to the foot support. The parameters were evaluated based on their effect on a number of dummy model responses. Results: The validation study showed that the mathematical model predicted the ATD's kinematics and measurements. Furthermore, the parameters that had the greatest effect on the dummy model responses were the lap belt angle, the D-ring x and y positions (upper belt anchor), the retractor pretensioner, and the retractor load limiter. The lap belt angle had the greatest effects of all parameters. The resulting head x displacement was 7. 8 cm shorter with a lap belt angle of 24 degrees to the horizontal, compared to a 73 degrees to the horizontal lap belt angle; it also resulted in a reduction of the head resultant acceleration by 9. 8 g. Conclusions: In order to decrease the Q 3 ATD head, <b>chest</b> and pelvis <b>accelerations</b> and to limit the Q 3 ATD head displacement, the following practices are recommended: first, position the D-ring rearward of the ATD so that the belt encloses the ATD's shoulder; second, position the lap belt anchors to make the lap belt angle 24 degrees to the horizontal, but make sure submarining is not induced; and finally, use a safety belt with pretensioner and load limiter functions. However, these recommendations need to be balanced with the recommendations for other occupant sizes, and any specific settings have to be evaluated further before introduction into vehicles. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the similarity between the response of the THUMS model and the Hybrid III Anthropometric Test Device (ATD) given existing Wright-Patterson (WP) sled tests. There were four tests selected for this comparison with frontal, spinal, rear, and lateral loading. The THUMS was placed in a sled configuration that replicated the WP configuration and the recorded seat acceleration for each test was applied to model seat. Once the modeling simulations were complete, they were compared to the WP results using two methods. The first was a visual inspection of the sled test videos compared to the THUMS d 3 plot files. This comparison resulted in an assessment of the overall kinematics of the two results. The other comparison was a comparison of the plotted data recorded for both tests. The metrics selected for comparison were seat acceleration, belt forces, head acceleration and <b>chest</b> <b>acceleration.</b> These metrics were recorded in all WP tests and were outputs of the THUMS model. Once the comparison of the THUMS to the WP tests was complete, the THUMS model output was also examined for possible injuries in these scenarios. These outputs included metrics for injury risk to the head, neck, thorax, lumbar spine and lower extremities. The metrics to evaluate head response were peak head acceleration, HIC 15, and HIC 36. For the neck, N (sub ij) was calculated. The thorax response was evaluated with peak <b>chest</b> <b>acceleration,</b> the Combined Thoracic Index (CTI), sternal deflection, chest deflection, and chest acceleration- 3 ms clip. The lumbar spine response was evaluated with lumbar spine force. Finally the lower extremity response was evaluated by femur and tibia force. The results of the simulation comparisons indicate the THUMS model had a similar response to the Hybrid III dummy given the same input. The primary difference seen between the two was a more flexible response of the THUMS compared to the Hybrid III. This flexibility was most pronounced in the neck flexion, shoulder deflection and chest deflection. Due to the flexibility of the THUMS, the resulting head and chest accelerations tended to lag the Hybrid III acceleration trace and have a lower peak value. The results of the injury metric comparison identified possible injury trends between simulations. Risk of head injury was highest for the lateral simulations. The risk of chest injury was highest for the rear impact. However, neck injury risk was approximately the same for all simulations. The injury metric value for lumbar spine force was highest for the spinal impact. The leg forces were highest for the rear and lateral impacts. The results of this comparison indicate the THUMS model performs in a similar manner as the Hybrid III ATD. The differences in the responses of model and the ATD are primarily due to the flexibility of the THUMS. This flexibility of the THUMS would be a more human like response. Based on the similarity between the two models, the THUMS should be used in further testing to assess risk of injury to the occupant...|$|E
40|$|The Dutch Ministry of Transport has {{commissioned}} SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research {{to carry}} out a simulation study into side collisions of cars against bicyclists. The aim of the study is to obtain a description of an ideal car front in terms of shape and stiffness. An ideal car front will cause minimal harm in case of side collisions with bicyclists. SWOV used its computer program VEDYAC for this purpose, after developing three specific models: a bicyclist model, a bicycle model and a car front model. These models were validated using data of experimental collisions from TNO Road Vehicles Research Institute. To evaluate the results of the actual simulations, a standard simulation was carried out. This standard simulation was a bicycle side collision, in which the bicycle travelled at 15 km/h and the car at 30 km/h. The car front was the standard developed and validated {{in the first part of}} the study. In the actual simulation the bonnet angle was varied from approximately 10 degrees up to 90 degrees. The last case represented a totally flat front end. The results of the simulation study indicate that the ideal front end should be high (bonnet angle between 75 degrees and 90 degrees) if the reduction of head acceleration is concerned. <b>Chest</b> <b>acceleration</b> increases with increasing bonnet angle, but this is considered of less importance compared with the reduction of head acceleration. It is recommended {{to carry out}} collision tests with a simulated car front end that represents a high front end...|$|E
