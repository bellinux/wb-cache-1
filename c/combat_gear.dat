5|$|Raynor is {{only ever}} {{depicted}} by his unit portrait {{through the course}} of StarCraft and Brood War. He is later shown in StarCraft II as a physically strong yet casually dressed character, wearing his <b>combat</b> <b>gear</b> over his normal clothes, which are further described in the novels as well-worn and rough in appearance. Raynor has a neatly trimmed moustache and beard, which by the time of StarCraft II are beginning to grey. His StarCraft II model also reveals the presence of tattoos on both his arms. In addition, a number of pieces of concept art depict Raynor smoking. Unlike other characters, Raynor isn't seen wearing a uniform at any point during the series, with the rare exceptions of when he is encased in marine combat armour. Raynor is often depicted riding a modified vulture hovercycle, which he uses for transport and in open land combat.|$|E
500|$|The United States Marine Corps {{used the}} International Hat sun helmet both as <b>combat</b> <b>gear</b> {{and as part}} of the Marine Corps {{training}} uniform. [...] The pith helmet, nicknamed the [...] "elephant hat", was first issued to the 1st Marine Division for its 1941 deployment to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. [...] The pith helmet has been retained as the mark of the marksmanship range coach.|$|E
500|$|Another parody {{came about}} when Israel Defense Forces {{soldiers}} created IDF Tik Tok in 2010, a viral dance video that opens with six infantry soldiers on patrol in Hebron, walking cautiously down a deserted street, armed and wearing full <b>combat</b> <b>gear,</b> when [...] "Tik Tok" [...] begins to play, {{and the soldiers}} break into choreographed dance moves.

500|$|The episode {{opens with}} three men, fitted with futuristic <b>combat</b> <b>gear</b> and {{automatic}} weapons, entering the virtual reality game First Person Shooter. In a control room, Ivan and Phoebe, the game's programmers, are monitoring the players' vital signs. Only {{one of the}} players makes it to the second level of the violent game, where he encounters a female character in a fetishistic leather outfit. She introduces herself as Maitreya, stating, [...] "This is my game". She then kills the player with a flintlock pistol.|$|E
500|$|Rockwell {{produced}} {{at least one}} depiction of Gillis that {{was not on the}} cover. The painting Willie Gillis in Convoy was produced in 1943, depicting Gillis, in <b>combat</b> <b>gear,</b> {{in the back of a}} covered military vehicle with his rifle in hand. Rockwell donated the painting to the Gardner High School for the graduating class, where it hung in the principal's office until 2000. [...] The school then loaned it to the Gardner Museum. [...] A charcoal sketch of the painting sold for $107,000 in 1999. [...] There was concern that the painting was not hung in a secure location. In 2005, the painting was restored and rehung at the high school. In 2014, it was sold for $1.9 million, with the proceeds used to create a foundation to benefit the schools in Gardner.|$|E
500|$|<b>Combat</b> <b>gear</b> {{was issued}} by and {{belonged to the}} Roman army, {{and had to be}} {{returned}} {{at the end of a}} wearer's service. Cavalry sports equipment appears to have been treated differently, as soldiers apparently privately commissioned and purchased it for their own use. They evidently retained it after they completed their service. Both helmets and visors have been found in graves and other contexts away from obvious military sites, as well as being deposited in forts and their vicinity. In some cases they were carefully folded up and buried, as in the case of the Guisborough Helmet. The Dutch historian Johan Nicolay has identified a [...] "lifecycle" [...] for Roman military equipment in which ex-soldiers took certain items home with them as a reminder of their service and occasionally disposed of them away from garrison sites as grave goods or votive offerings.|$|E
50|$|The TDF reservist is comparably poorly {{equipped}} for modern warfare. The number of <b>combat,</b> protection <b>gear</b> and supplies {{will be most}} likely limited {{in the event of}} war. The Territorial Defence Force consists of ordinary citizens of all occupations who undertake training in the basics of modern warfare. The weapons trained on are mainly of soviet origin and abandoned material used formerly by the regular army, including tanks. Such weapons are the AK series assault rifes and rocket propelled launchers RPG-7.|$|R
25|$|In MGS4, players {{assume the}} role of an aged Solid Snake (also {{referred}} to as Old Snake), using stealth, close quarters combat, and traditional Metal <b>Gear</b> <b>combat.</b> The overhead third-person camera of earlier games {{has been replaced by a}} streamlined view and over-the-shoulder camera for aiming a weapon, with an optional first-person view at the toggle of a button.|$|R
50|$|During the Syrian Civil War a {{naturalized}} U.S. {{citizen of}} Bosnian origin joined ISIL and died while fighting. In 2015 six Bosnian {{residents of the}} U.S. were charged with providing material support for terrorism. The six sent funds ranging from $150 to $1,850, and also “U.S. military uniforms, tactical clothes and <b>gear,</b> <b>combat</b> boots, military surplus supplies and other items from businesses in St. Louis” in August 2013.|$|R

2500|$|Although the 6,000-ton Ilya Muromets is {{the largest}} {{icebreaker}} ever built for the Russian Navy, she is somewhat smaller than the civilian icebreakers operated by Atomflot, Rosmorport and Sovcomflot. In terms of size and general layout, the [...] vessel {{is comparable to the}} civilian Project MPSV06 multi-purpose salvage vessels with a working deck aft, deckhouse amidships and a helideck rated for Kamov Ka-27 helicopter. Like her civilian counterparts, Ilya Muromets is also equipped with a towing winch and stern notch for escorting other ships in ice conditions. She is served by a crew of 32 but can carry up to 50 marines in full <b>combat</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to small-scale, hand-to-hand combat, the characters sometimes fight from within their respective giant robots, called <b>gears.</b> In <b>gear</b> <b>combat,</b> the limiting factor of AP {{is replaced by}} fuel, with each attack consuming an amount corresponding to its power. For these battles, [...] "deathblows" [...] may only be executed after first building up the [...] "Attack Level"—an abstract concept represented by a number in the bottom-left of the <b>gear</b> <b>combat</b> interface—through the execution of simple strong, moderate, or weak attacks. One deathblow is allowed per point on the Attack Level gauge. There are three levels for normal gear deathblows and, beyond the third level, an [...] "infinite" [...] level with {{its own set of}} deathblows. To reach [...] "Infinity Mode", a character has to stay at attack level 3 while performing any other action. With each turn, there is a chance that Infinity Mode will be reached. Having a duration of three turns, Infinity Mode allows fuel to be recharged in much larger quantities and, while in this mode, gears have access to [...] "Infinity" [...] attacks.|$|R
50|$|The Gameplay {{has been}} {{compared}} to Bayonetta, and revolves around hack and slash combat. Throughout the game, two sets of playable characters can be swapped with on the fly, each boasting their own unique attacks and abilities (the characters at hand depend on the given stage). Throughout the game, players will earn yellow orbs, which act as a form of currency. These orbs may be exchanged for new <b>combat</b> moves and <b>gear.</b>|$|R

At Goodenough Island, a Marine cargo was loaded consisting of <b>combat</b> vehicles and <b>gear</b> of the First Marine Division to be landed at Cape Cretin and on 13 December 1943, LST-22 completed loading Marine Corps personnel and joined Task Force 76.2.2 consisting of two Coast Guard-manned and five Navy-manned LSTs with three destroyers and [...] for Cape Gloucester, New Britain.|$|R
2500|$|In September 2011, 19 {{soldiers}} {{participated in}} a two-week assessment of the LSAT light machine gun at Fort Benning, Georgia to demonstrate its capabilities against the M249 SAW. [...] In one test the soldiers, half armed with SAWs and half with LSATs, marched six miles in full <b>combat</b> <b>gear</b> then fired at targets to measure stress and muscle fatigue. [...] Another test had the soldiers sprint 200 yards wearing body armor and a basic load of ammunition, then rapidly engage close-range targets. [...] A third week involved soldiers of the 75th Ranger Regiment performing a squad maneuver live-fire exercise in an urban setting. [...] Feedback from participants favored the LSAT for its lighter weight and decreased recoil. [...] Soldiers remarked the LSAT had better accuracy than the M249. [...] The semi-automatic option made it more viable for room clearing. [...] One Ranger even said the LSAT performed better than the Mk 46 machine gun used by special operations forces. 15 out of 19 soldiers that participated in the assessment said they would prefer using the LSAT in combat rather than the SAW. [...] The LSAT LMG is 41 percent lighter than the [...] SAW and its ammunition volume is 12 percent less, enabling all the soldiers that maneuvered the woodland obstacle course to complete it faster when carrying it. [...] Participants also took less time to zero their machine guns when using the LSAT; one soldier failed repeatedly to accurately zero the SAW but successfully zeroed the LSAT on the first try. [...] The LMG users completed the course, on average, one minute and 11 seconds faster than SAW users due to increased mobility given by its shorter length, adjustable stock, and lighter ammo. [...] When firing, gunners felt virtually no recoil from the LSAT LMG. The eight prototype weapons fired a combined 25,000 rounds, moving its cased telescoped ammunition to technology readiness level 7.|$|E

50|$|A MCIWS {{course is}} usually three {{calendar}} weeks long, with training {{taking place on}} work days, and remediation conducted as necessary. In the past, the course used to yield attrition rates of up to 60 or even 70 percent, due to high physical and skills performance demands. Students are conditioned daily in lap swim sessions, and their endurance and technique are tested in rescue practice training blocks that add <b>combat</b> uniform and <b>gear</b> in increments each time. Confidence and a calm mindset are consistently {{put to the test}} with end-of-day water aerobics sessions that mix aerobic and anaerobic speed, endurance, and technique-based exercises. Every training event is designed to enhance proficiency in multiple disciplines.|$|R
50|$|As {{the setting}} is {{primarily}} the backdrop {{for a series of}} strategy, roleplaying, and video games the military and weaponry are the main focus. One of the most popular weapon systems of the various groups on Terra Nova are the machines known as Heavy Gears that give the universe its name. They are 12- to 20-foot-tall (12 to 20 ft) bipedal, armored, single occupancy military <b>combat</b> units. The <b>Gears</b> are less heavily armed and armored than main battle tanks used by the Terra Nova armies. However, the Gears provide a mix of capabilities that prove effective as the setting/game rules typically allow victory through maneuver warfare and place less emphasis on raw firepower and armor.|$|R
5000|$|ChouSeiShin Garuda (Chōseishin Garūda) is the Flame Tribe's ChouSeiShin, {{the second}} to be awaken from its slumber in Houhou Mountain. In Live Mode, Garuda is shaped after a phoenix and attacks with his guns located under its wings where its legs are, firing lasers and energy beams. Garuda can also tackle enemies after engulfing himself in flames. In Warrior Mode, Garuda mostly relies on the 'Garu Claw', which are his talons {{on the back of}} his fists, for close-range combat. He {{performs}} his finishing move [...] "Fire Bird Slash" [...] with them. Garuda can also summon a sword called Burning Saber for armed melee <b>combat.</b> Tarious' Sazer <b>Gear</b> equips Garuda with a giant version of the Falcon Bow, and Lion's Sazer Gear equips Garuda with giant versions of the Double Crescents.|$|R

He immediately learned that not all of his photos would end up in print, as his first war assignment {{turned out to be a}} secret mission. War coverage was the ultimate on-the-job training, needing to learn on the spot such feats as descending rope ladders overloaded with both <b>combat</b> and photographic <b>gear</b> in order to accompany troops from ship to shore. Landing with the Marines on Guadalcanal, Morse's cameras recorded America's first amphibious attack in the Pacific. He arranged for the captain of the , the Navy ship on which Morse had arrived, to deliver his film to Washington, D.C., as such pictures needed to be screened before being printed. Unfortunately, the Vincennes was torpedoed that night in the Battle of Savo Island. [...] Morse's film and equipment went down with the ship while he treaded water all night amidst destroyers dropping depth charges on submarines, fortunately scaring away the sharks and barracuda. With neither cameras nor clothing, Morse made a secret pact with Naval command to return briefly to Life in New York to re-equip, but was mandated to tell no details of the sea battle, no explanation of how he lost his equipment. Unknown to him, he was being trailed by Naval intelligence to confirm that he had kept his word. Guadalcanal grew a jungle so thick that accompanying nocturnal troop movement was filled with the risk of abandonment if one ever lost sight of the soldier's foot he was following.|$|R
