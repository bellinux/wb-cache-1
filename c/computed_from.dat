5|$|The {{derivative}} of a function can, in principle, be <b>computed</b> <b>from</b> the definition {{by considering the}} difference quotient, and computing its limit.

5|$|An {{example of}} the use of Fleiss' kappa may be the following: Consider {{fourteen}} psychiatrists are asked to look at ten patients.

These are compiled into a matrix, and Fleiss' kappa can be <b>computed</b> <b>from</b> this matrix (see example below) to show the degree of agreement between the psychiatrists above the level of agreement expected by chance.|$|E

(When orbiting the Earth, the last two terms are known as the apogee and perigee.)

It computes matching and average missing information at each level and combines them using combined formula (see Eq. 2) and returns it to its previous level matching information.

25|$|A DST-III or DST-IV can be <b>computed</b> <b>from</b> a DCT-III or DCT-IV (see {{discrete}} cosine transform), respectively, by {{reversing the}} order of the inputs and flipping the sign of every other output, and vice versa for DST-II from DCT-II. In this way it follows that types II–IV of the DST require exactly the same number of arithmetic operations (additions and multiplications) as the corresponding DCT types.|$|E
25|$|Rough {{membership}} primarily {{differs from}} the fuzzy membership in that the membership of union and intersection of sets cannot, in general, be <b>computed</b> <b>from</b> their constituent membership {{as is the case}} of fuzzy sets. In this, rough membership is a generalization of fuzzy membership. Furthermore, the rough membership function is grounded more in probability than the conventionally held concepts of the fuzzy membership function.|$|E

25|$|The {{computation}} {{of physical}} observables from matrix elements of operators requires some care. Direct computation {{would require an}} infinite sum over Fock space. One can instead borrow from the many-body coupled cluster method a construction that computes expectation values from right and left eigenstates. This construction can be extended to include off-diagonal matrix elements and gauge projections. Physical quantities can then be <b>computed</b> <b>from</b> {{the right and left}} LFCC eigenstates.|$|E
25|$|For stars {{significantly}} less than 230 million light years away, the Solar System may be approximated as an inertial frame and so the effect of secular aberration is equivalent to a light-time correction. This includes stars in the Milky Way, since the Milky Way is about 100,000 light years in diameter. For these stars the true position of the star is then easily <b>computed</b> <b>from</b> its proper motion and its distance.|$|E
25|$|German {{physicist}} Johann Hittorf {{concluded that}} ion movement caused electric current. In 1853 Hittorf noticed that some ions traveled {{more rapidly than}} others. This observation led {{to the concept of}} transport number, the rate at which particular ions carried the electric current. Hittorf measured the changes in the concentration of electrolysed solutions, <b>computed</b> <b>from</b> these the transport numbers (relative carrying capacities) of many ions, and, in 1869, published his findings governing the migration of ions.|$|E

25|$|The {{impedance}} {{seen at the}} feedpoint of a dipole {{of various}} lengths has been plotted above, {{in terms of the}} real (resistive) component Rdipole and the imaginary (reactive) component jXdipole of that impedance. For the case of an antenna with perfect conductors (no ohmic loss), Rdipole is identical to the radiation resistance, which can more easily be <b>computed</b> <b>from</b> the total power in the far-field radiation pattern for a given applied current as we showed for the short dipole. The calculation of Xdipole is more difficult.|$|E
25|$|Gun {{fire control}} systems require {{corrections}} to gun-order angles (bearing and elevation) {{to compensate for}} deck tilt (pitch and roll). In traditional systems, a stabilizing gyroscope with a vertical spin axis corrects for deck tilt, and stabilizes the optical sights and radar antenna. However, gun barrels point in a direction different from the line of sight to the target, to anticipate target movement {{and fall of the}} projectile due to gravity, among other factors. Gun mounts roll and pitch with the deck plane, but also require stabilization. Gun orders include angles <b>computed</b> <b>from</b> the vertical gyro data, and those computations involve Euler angles.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to make statistical inferences without assuming a particular parametric family of probability distributions. In that case, one speaks of non-parametric statistics {{as opposed to the}} parametric statistics just described. For example, a test based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficient would be called non-parametric since the statistic is <b>computed</b> <b>from</b> the rank-order of the data disregarding their actual values (and thus regardless of the distribution they were sampled from), whereas those based on the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient are parametric tests since it is computed directly from the data values and thus estimates the parameter known as the population correlation.|$|E
