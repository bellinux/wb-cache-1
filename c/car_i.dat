He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that <b>car,</b> <b>I</b> don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E

500|$|She {{lived for}} a few months in a flat Starr owned at 34 Montagu Square, central London, but {{returned}} to Kenwood as Lennon and Ono preferred to live there instead, rather than in isolated Weybridge. Lennon and Cynthia had one last short meeting at Kenwood (with Ono alongside Lennon), where Lennon accused her of having an affair in India, saying she was no [...] "innocent little flower". McCartney visited her and Julian that year, and on the way to Kenwood he composed a song in his head which later became [...] "Hey Jude". Talking about their divorce, McCartney later said: [...] "We'd been very good friends for millions of years and I thought it was a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life".

[...] She was once asked if Lennon had written any songs about their time together, and answered: [...] "It was too sloppy when you were young to dedicate anything to anybody.
