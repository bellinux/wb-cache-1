5|$|One {{possible}} explanation for this asymmetry is a large-scale convection above the core. The convection <b>can</b> <b>create</b> variations in the local abundances of elements, resulting in uneven nuclear burning during the collapse, bounce and resulting expansion.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands are {{involved}} in skin problems such as acne and keratosis pilaris. In the skin pores, sebum and keratin <b>can</b> <b>create</b> a hyperkeratotic plug called a comedo.|$|E
50|$|For codes from 0 to 127, the {{original}} 7-bit ASCII standard set, {{most of these}} characters can be used without a character reference. Codes from 160 to 255 <b>can</b> all be <b>created</b> using character entity names. Only a few higher-numbered codes <b>can</b> be <b>created</b> using entity names, but all <b>can</b> be <b>created</b> by decimal number character reference.|$|R
50|$|The {{result is}} that many {{different}} proteins <b>can</b> be <b>created</b> from the same mRNA strand, with similar 5' ends (to varying degrees) and same 3' ends. Or, different proteins <b>can</b> be <b>created</b> with positive sense viral RNA.|$|R

5|$|Seeds can be {{used for}} {{propagation}} of the plant or to create hybrids and can take five to eight years to produce flowering plants. Since interspecific cross-pollination occurs, overlapping wild populations <b>can</b> <b>create</b> natural hybrids.|$|E
5|$|After a video team {{is brought}} to the office to create a {{commercial}} for the company, Michael decides that the employees of the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin <b>can</b> <b>create</b> a better commercial.

5|$|Along {{with the}} Euphoria engine, Backbreaker also {{features}} a create-a-team tool and logo creator similar to the editor found in Forza Motorsport 2.

50|$|Infographics <b>can</b> be <b>created</b> by hand using simple {{everyday}} {{tools such}} as graph paper, pencils, markers, and rulers.

50|$|Pinholes <b>can</b> be <b>created</b> {{manually}} or programmatically. They <b>can</b> be temporary, <b>created</b> dynamically for {{a specific}} duration such as for a dynamic connection, or permanent, such as for signaling functions.|$|R
5|$|Bioluminescence {{attracted}} the attention of the United States Navy in the Cold War, since submarines in some waters <b>can</b> <b>create</b> a bright enough wake to be detected; a German submarine was sunk in the First World War, having been detected in this way. The navy was interested in predicting when such detection would be possible, and hence guiding their own submarines to avoid detection.|$|E
5|$|Cacti whose stems {{are even}} smaller may be {{described}} as globular (or globose). They consist of shorter, more ball-shaped stems than columnar cacti. Globular cacti may be solitary, such as Ferocactus latispinus, or their stems may form clusters that <b>can</b> <b>create</b> large mounds. All or some stems in a cluster may share a common root.|$|E
5|$|Highway21 {{is often}} subject to winter {{closures}} due to lake effect caused by snowsquall, which <b>can</b> <b>create</b> sudden whiteout conditions along the Lake Huron shoreline. Several Emergency Detour Routes {{have been established}} further inland to guide drivers around such closures. Care should be taken during the winter months, as these storms can progress rapidly and unexpectedly.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, the Somali {{environmentalist}} Fatima Jibrell {{wrote and}} co-produced the short film Charcoal Traffic, which {{was directed by}} the filmmaker Nathan Collett. Shot on location in Somalia, it employs a fictional storyline {{to educate the public}} about the ecological damage that charcoal production <b>can</b> <b>create.</b>|$|E
5|$|Members of the General Assembly {{are elected}} from districts that are realigned every ten years. Representatives serve terms {{of two years}} and {{senators}} serve terms of four years. Both houses <b>can</b> <b>create</b> bills, but bills must pass both houses {{before it can be}} submitted to the governor and enacted into law.|$|E
5|$|Nectar- and pollen-eating bats {{are able}} to hover, {{in a similar way}} to hummingbirds. The sharp leading edges of the wings <b>can</b> <b>create</b> vortexes which provide lift. The vortex may be {{stabilized}} by the animal changing its wing curvatures.|$|E
50|$|An epiphragm is a {{temporary}} structure which <b>can</b> be <b>created</b> by many species of shelled, air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks. It <b>can</b> also be <b>created</b> by freshwater snails when temporary pools dry up.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} fixed {{structures}} <b>can</b> <b>create</b> structural colours, by mechanisms including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres and deformed matrices. Structures can {{be far more}} elaborate than a single thin film: films can be stacked up to give strong iridescence, to combine two colours, or to balance out the inevitable change of colour with angle to give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect. Each mechanism offers a specific {{solution to the problem}} of creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions.|$|E
5|$|As in {{previous}} games, the player assumes {{the role of}} the Stranger, a friend of Atrus. A member of the D'ni race, Atrus <b>can</b> <b>create</b> links to other worlds called Ages by writing descriptive books. In Exile, Atrus has written an Age for the D'ni to live on while rebuilding their civilization; it is stolen, however, by a mysterious figure. The Stranger pursues the thief in an attempt to reclaim Atrus' book.|$|E

5|$|Brood War {{introduces}} seven new units. Each race {{is given}} access to a unique ground unit: the Zerg <b>can</b> <b>create</b> a defensive unit that can attack from the concealment of its burrow, while the Terrans can train combat medics. The Protoss are able to produce dark templar units, a powerful cloaked melee unit only given to the player in special missions of StarCraft. Protoss players can merge two of these units to create a special spellcaster unit. Each race is also {{given access to}} a dedicated air-to-air attack unit.|$|E
5|$|Citing {{the limited}} {{size of the}} market as the main {{impediment}} in economic growth, Nurkse reasons that an increase in productivity <b>can</b> <b>create</b> a virtuous circle of growth. Thus, a large scale investment programme in {{a wide array of}} industries simultaneously is the answer. The increase in demand for one industry will lead to an increase in demand for another industry due to complementarity of demands. As Say's Law states, supply creates its own demand.|$|E
5|$|Customize mode {{is divided}} between the F-Zero Shop, Garage, and Emblem Editor. The shop is where {{opponent}} machines, custom parts for vehicle creation, and miscellaneous items such as story mode chapters and staff ghost data can be purchased with tickets. Tickets are acquired as the player progresses through the Grand Prix, Time Attack, and Story mode. In the Garage section, players <b>can</b> <b>create</b> a machine with three custom parts or print emblems on any vehicle. The parts are divided into body, cockpit, and booster categories, and affect the vehicle's overall durability, maximum speed, cornering, and acceleration. The Emblem Editor is a tool-set for decal creation.|$|E
