50|$|The biggest {{difference}} from Cassino is {{the values of}} the cards. Jacks, Queens and Kings <b>count</b> <b>as</b> 11, 12 and 13 respectively. Aces <b>count</b> <b>as</b> both 1 and 14. 2♠ <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> both 2 and 15. 10♦ <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> both 10 and 16.|$|R
5000|$|For a commandment {{with both}} {{positive}} and negative components, the positive component <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> a positive instruction, while the negative component <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> a negative prohibition. For example, the Torah commands to rest on the Sabbath and forbids against doing work on that day. Resting <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> a positive instruction, and working <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> a negative prohibition.|$|R

50|$|Note: Between 1964-1973, several actresses were {{nominated}} for multiple performances {{in a single}} year, these each <b>count</b> <b>as</b> one nomination.

5|$|The {{numbering}} {{reflects the}} uninterrupted terms in office {{served by a}} single man. For example, Jorge Sampaio served two consecutive terms and is <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> the 19th president (not the 19th and 20th). Teófilo Braga served as the first and sole president of the Provisional Government, and therefore is {{not considered to be}} the first President, although he would serve again as head of state and be the second president after the resignation of Manuel de Arriaga. However, Bernardino Machado served two non-consecutive terms, and he is <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> both the third and the eighth presidents. Because of this, the list below contains 20 presidencies, but only 19 presidents.|$|E
5|$|A further 103,648 in the City of Paris and in 412,114 in the Paris Region {{were born}} in foreign {{countries}} with French citizenship at birth.

5|$|In Royal Prussia, 41% of the parishes were <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> Lutheran in {{the second}} half of the 16th century, but that {{percentage}} kept increasing. According to Kasper Cichocki, who wrote in the early 17th century, only remnants of Catholicism were left there in his time. Lutheranism was strongly dominant in Royal Prussia throughout the 17th century, with the exception of Warmia (Ermland).|$|E
5000|$|For first- and second-declension nouns, {{the rule}} is more complex. The {{thematic}} vowel ( [...] or [...] ) <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> neither stem nor ending, but alternates between the two depending on which accent is considered. For post-stem accent, it <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> part of the ending; for pre-ending accent, it <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> part of the stem.|$|R

5|$|Nandanar (also spelt as Nantanar), {{also known}} as Tirunalaippovar (Thirunaalaippovar) and Tiru Nalai Povar Nayanar, was a Nayanar saint, who is venerated in the Hindu sect of Shaivism. He is the only Dalit ("untouchable") saint in the Nayanars. He is {{generally}} <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> the eighteenth {{in the list of}} 63 Nayanars. Like the other Nayanars, he was a devout devotee of the god Shiva.|$|E
5000|$|One {{can easily}} {{see that a}} one-loop {{contribution}} from the [...] Lagrangian <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> [...] by noting that the integration measure <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> , the propagator <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> , while the derivative contributions <b>count</b> <b>as</b> [...] Therefore, since the calculation is valid to , one removes the divergences in the calculation with the renormalization of the low-energy constants (LECs) from the [...] Lagrangian. So if one wishes to remove all the divergences in the computation of a given observable to , one uses the coupling constants in the expression for the [...] Lagrangian to remove those divergences.|$|R
40|$|A {{standing}} {{debate in}} philosophy of sport concerns whether sport can <b>count</b> <b>as</b> art in some sense. But {{the debate is}} often conducted at cross purposes. Naysayers insist that no sport is an artform while proponents insist that certain sport performances <b>count</b> <b>as</b> artworks – but these are entirely consistent claims. Both sides make unwarranted assumptions: naysayers are purists about sport and art (no transaesthetic purposes) whereas proponents are tokenists about artforms. Naysayers admit that figure skating may <b>count</b> <b>as</b> art yet only in non-competitive contexts. Their burden is thus to explain why a routine (e. g., Torvill and Dean’s ‘Bolero’) may <b>count</b> <b>as</b> art in a showcase {{but not at the}} Olympics. The debate is also inevitably framed in terms of whether sport <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> art, neglecting the equally viable question of whether art in some form (e. g., competitive dance) may also <b>count</b> <b>as</b> sport. I conclude in favour of an appropriately qualified sport-as-art thesis...|$|R

5|$|The listed National Forest names {{represent}} the current management {{divisions of the}} National Forest System. Forests that are managed separately, such as Allegheny National Forest and Monongahela National Forest, are listed as separate forests. But forests that are managed together {{may or may not}} be listed separately. Forests managed together and with hyphenated names, such as Salmon-Challis National Forest, are considered to be a single National Forest. Forests that are managed together under titles such as Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forests, are considered to be separate forests. National Forests listed in this column in small text are constituent National Forests managed by, but not included in the name of, the named National Forest in normal text. If you are counting to reach 154 National Forests, count hyphenated names as two forests, with the exception of Manti-La Sal, which is the official name of one forest. Uinta-Wasatch-Cache is <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> three and George Washington and Jefferson is <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> two.|$|E
