5|$|He {{assumed the}} worst in people and he brought out {{the worst in}} them... He clung {{to the idea of}} being 'tough'. He thought that was what had brought him to the edge of greatness. But that was what betrayed him. He <b>could</b> <b>not</b> open himself to other men and he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> open himself to greatness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, one. Carlotta Gispardi. But she <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> speak English, and I <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> speak Dago; and she died. I don't care; though I {{never knew}} any, I {{seem to know}} as much about them as you do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed, sometimes; but we <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> stay mad, {{and always}} {{made it up}} again {{as soon as we}} could. Jimmy used to come round first, and say, 'All serene, Polly,' so kind and jolly, that I <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> help {{laughing}} and being friends right away." ...|$|R

He's {{over there}} if he's anywhere, an' maybe those Pathans have got 'im. For the love o' Gawd don't look for 'im in the nullahs! Let's {{go over the}} river." ...|$|R
5|$|The ethical {{requirements}} of senators were significant. Senators <b>could</b> <b>not</b> engage in banking or {{any form of}} public contract. They <b>could</b> <b>not</b> own a ship that was large enough to participate in foreign commerce, and they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> leave Italy without permission from the Senate. In addition, since they were not paid, individuals usually sought to become a senator only if they were independently wealthy.|$|E

5|$|After a short honeymoon, Beatrice and {{her husband}} {{fulfilled}} their promise {{and returned to the}} Queen's side. The Queen made it clear that she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> cope on her own and that the couple <b>could</b> <b>not</b> travel without her. Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family. Beatrice's love for Henry, like that of the Queen's for the Prince Consort, seemed to increase the longer they were married. When Henry travelled without Beatrice, she appeared happier when he returned.|$|E

But Fan's news settled that point, and just now the look in my Polly's face settled the other. I <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> wait another minute, or let you either, and I <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> help {{stretching}} out my arms to my little wife, God bless her, though I know I don't deserve her." ...|$|R
5|$|All eight {{aircraft}} were complete by 1 November and {{had been}} tested to ensure their readiness {{to participate in the}} parade. They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13. It was considered too risky to fly the aircraft from Gorky to Moscow and their wings <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be dismounted which meant that they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be railed to Moscow either. Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to Moscow, but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather.|$|E
5|$|Another {{question}} in the case was whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had jurisdiction to hear the case. Hill argued {{that because of the}} structure of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the court <b>could</b> <b>not</b> hear the case. She argued that elections <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{have done}} {{me a great}} wrong--you have done me a cruel wrong! I have been telling it to Miss Vivian; I came on purpose to tell her. I can't really tell her; I can't tell her the details; it 's too painful! But you know what I mean! I <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> stand it any longer. I thought of going away--but I <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> do that. I must come and say what I feel. I can't bear it now." ...|$|R

5|$|Because the self-anchored {{structure}} {{relies on}} the roadway itself to absorb stresses, the suspension cables <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be installed until the roadway was built; however, until the cables were in place the roadway <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be supported. To resolve this problem, Topham had the roadway built in sections, supported on very tall barges. The barges were floated into place at low tide, and the rising tide was used to lift the sections above {{the height of the}} piers. As the tide ebbed, the roadway dropped into place.|$|E
5|$|Black's {{majority}} opinion in McCollum v. Board of Education (1948) {{held that the}} government <b>could</b> <b>not</b> provide religious instruction in public schools. In Torcaso v. Watkins (1961), he delivered an opinion which affirmed that the states <b>could</b> <b>not</b> use religious tests as qualifications for public office. Similarly, he authored the {{majority opinion}} in Engel v. Vitale (1962), which declared it unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official prayers in public schools.|$|E

60|$|It {{was very}} awkward, but it <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> be helped, and all Polly {{could do was}} {{to tell the truth}} and make the best of it.|$|R
5|$|Homing pigeons use {{magnetic}} field information with other navigational cues. Pioneering researcher William Keeton showed that time-shifted homing pigeons <b>could</b> <b>not</b> orient themselves correctly {{on a clear}} sunny day, but could do so on an overcast day, suggesting that the birds prefer {{to rely on the}} direction of the sun, but switch to using a {{magnetic field}} cue when the sun is not visible. This was confirmed by experiments with magnets: the pigeons <b>could</b> <b>not</b> orient correctly on an overcast day when the magnetic field was disrupted.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the plans}} {{did not fully}} work as intended. The native populations that joined Arenales <b>could</b> <b>not</b> resist the royalist counter-attacks, and the slaves did not join the army in the {{expected}} numbers. The Argentine provinces <b>could</b> <b>not</b> send the supporting army that San Martín had requested earlier, and the Army of the North no longer existed. As a result, he wrote to Simón Bolívar, trying to coordinate actions with him.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the theory}} <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be {{implemented}} until advances in computing of the 1960s.|$|E
