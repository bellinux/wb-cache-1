50|$|The general <b>Cartesian</b> <b>notation</b> of {{the form}} comes from the French {{mathematician}} Gabriel Lamé (1795 - 1870), who generalized the equation for the ellipse.|$|E
50|$|When a {{unit vector}} in space is expressed, with <b>Cartesian</b> <b>notation,</b> as a linear {{combination}} of i, j, k, its three scalar components {{can be referred to}} as direction cosines. The value of each component is equal to the cosine of the angle formed by the unit vector with the respective basis vector. This is one of the methods used to describe the orientation (angular position) of a straight line, segment of straight line, oriented axis, or segment of oriented axis (vector).|$|E
50|$|Although {{the terms}} used for {{defining}} exponents differed between authors and times, the general system {{was the primary}} exponent notation until René Descartes devised the <b>Cartesian</b> exponent <b>notation,</b> which is still used today.|$|R

50|$|By using <b>Cartesian</b> tensor <b>notation</b> in {{his last}} three books, Engineering Mechanics, Statics of Deformable Bodies, and Cartesian Tensors, Myklestad became an early proponent of tensor {{analysis}} in the undergraduate engineering curriculum. During his varied and productive career he also received five US patents.|$|R
5000|$|Recordian {{notation}} for exponentiation, however, {{differed from}} the later <b>Cartesian</b> <b>notation</b> [...] Recorde expressed indices and surds larger than 3 in a systematic form based on the prime factorization of the exponent: a factor of two he termed a zenzic, and a factor of three, a cubic. Recorde termed the larger prime numbers appearing in this factorization sursolids, distinguishing between them by use of ordinal numbers: that is, he defined 5 as the first sursolid and 7 as the second sursolid.He also devised symbols for these factors: a zenzic was denoted by z, and a cubic by &. For instance, he referred to p8=p2×2×2 as pzzz (the zenzizenzizenzic of p), and q12=q2×2×3 as qzz& (the zenzizenzicubic of q).|$|E
30|$|Let B be an {{open set}} domain of a {{three-dimensional}} Euclidian space {{occupied by the}} reference configuration of a homogeneous micropolar body. We assume that B is regular and a finite region with boundary ∂B and we denote the closure of B by B̄. We use a fixed system of rectangular Cartesian axes and adopt <b>Cartesian</b> tensor <b>notation.</b> Points in B are denoted by x_j and t∈ [0,∞) is the temporal variable. Also, the spatial argument and the time argument of a function will be omitted {{when there is no}} likelihood of confusion. A superposed dot denotes the differentiation with respect to time t, and a subscript preceded by a comma denotes the differentiation with respect to the corresponding spatial variable.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{important}} operation {{related to}} tensor derivatives in continuum mechanics is integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts {{can be written}} aswhere [...] and [...] are differentiable tensor fields of arbitrary order, [...] is the unit outward normal to the domain over which the tensor fields are defined, [...] represents a generalized tensor product operator, and [...] is a generalized gradient operator. When [...] {{is equal to the}} identity tensor, we get the divergence theoremWe can express the formula for integration by parts in <b>Cartesian</b> index <b>notation</b> asFor the special case where the tensor product operation is a contraction of one index and the gradient operation is a divergence, and both [...] and [...] are second order tensors, we haveIn index notation, ...|$|R
40|$|A simple matrix {{expression}} is {{obtained for the}} strain components of a beam in which the displacements and rotations are large. The only restrictions are on the magnitudes of the strain and of the local rotation, a newly-identified kinematical quantity. The local rotation {{is defined as the}} change of orientation of material elements relative to the change of orientation of the beam reference triad. The vectors and tensors in the theory are resolved along orthogonal triads of base vectors centered along the undeformed and deformed beam reference axes, so <b>Cartesian</b> tensor <b>notation</b> is used. Although a curvilinear coordinate system is natural to the beam problem, the complications usually associated with its use are circumvented. Local rotations appear explicitly in the resulting strain expressions, facilitating the treatment of beams with both open and closed cross sections in applications of the theory. The theory is used to obtain the kinematical relations for coupled bending, torsion extension, shear deformation, and warping of an initially curved and twisted beam...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{intended}} to be a beginner`s exercise book for the study of basic finite-difference techniques in computational fluid dynamics. It is written for a student level ranging from high-school senior to university senior. Equations are derived from basic principles using algebra. Some discussion of partial-differential equations is included, but knowledge of calculus is not essential. The student is expected, however, to have some familiarity with the FORTRAN computer language, as the syntax of the computer codes themselves is not discussed. Topics examined in this work include: one-dimensional heat flow, one-dimensional compressible fluid flow, two-dimensional compressible fluid flow, and two-dimensional incompressible fluid flow with additions of the equations of heat flow and the {Kappa}-{epsilon} model for turbulence transport. Emphasis is placed on numerical instabilities and methods by which they can be avoided, techniques {{that can be used to}} evaluate the accuracy of finite-difference approximations, and the writing of the finite-difference codes themselves. Concepts introduced in this work include: flux and conservation, implicit and explicit methods, Lagrangian and Eulerian methods, shocks and rarefactions, donor-cell and cell-centered advective fluxes, compressible and incompressible fluids, the Boussinesq approximation for heat flow, <b>Cartesian</b> tensor <b>notation,</b> the Boussinesq approximation for the Reynolds stress tensor, and the modeling of transport equations. A glossary is provided which defines these and other terms...|$|R
