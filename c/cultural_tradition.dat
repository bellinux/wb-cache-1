5|$|Another {{influence}} of the Liao <b>cultural</b> <b>tradition</b> {{is seen in the}} Yuan dynasty's zaju (杂剧) theater, its associated orchestration, and the qu (曲) and sanqu (散曲) forms of Classical Chinese poetry.

We suggest that the Structure of Chinese <b>Cultural</b> <b>Traditions</b> provides a unique model of Chinese culture that complements other generic measures, thereby allowing a deep understanding of Chinese culture...|$|R
