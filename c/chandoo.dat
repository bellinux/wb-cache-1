5000|$|The film {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu wrote [...] "The narration is good, keeps the curiosity factor alive {{but it is}} not the sort that keeps us on the edge of our seats and taking us to nail-biting climaxes. The story offers little thrill. There is sufficient humor and romance to keep the film balanced but the story with the twist is not so much about the crime but about the mindset of the criminal who uses a clever mix of science and religion to plan a brilliant murder". Hemanth Kumar of The Times of India wrote [...] "The good thing about the film is that it sticks to its storyline and everyone seems to know what they are doing. Karthikeya is one of the finer films made in the recent past and in times like these, that in itself is like a big compliment" [...] and rated the film 3.5 out of 5. Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle wrote [...] "Despite its drawbacks ‘Karthikeya’ is a very refreshing film and Chandu Mondeti’s debut can be termed a success. It is a thriller with tight screenplay a new story. Whoever feels bored with the regular song-dance masala films, should watch this thriller for a change" [...] and rated the film 3 out of 5. Sify wrote [...] "Overall Karthikeya is different from regular commercial movies that dot the Telugu screen. Like we said it is a suspense thriller that mixes bhakti and rational thinking quite well to large extent and we do appreciate the producer and the actor Nikhil for attempting something novel". 123telugu stated [...] "On the whole, Karthikeya is one of the most refreshing films in the recent past. Novel concept, gripping screenplay, Nikhil’s performance and cleverly designed suspense elements make this film different from others, and ends up as quite an engaging watch this weekend" [...] and rated it 3.5 out of 5. Jeevi of Idlebrain.com wrote [...] "Actor Nikhil and producer should be appreciated for agreeing to do a film that is different from regular Telugu movies. Supported by a neat screenplay and a bit of comedy, debutant director <b>Chandoo</b> Mondeti delivers a decent movie. Additional plus point of the movie is runtime. The minus points of the movie are slow-paced narration. The family drama and romance didn’t work well. On a whole, Karthikeya is a different yet interesting movie" [...] and rated it 3.25 out of 5. Oneindia Entertainment and IndiaGlitz called the film a one time watch and both rated it 3 out of 5.|$|E
