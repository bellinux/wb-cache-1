5|$|The <b>consul</b> of the Roman Republic was {{the highest-ranking}} {{ordinary}} magistrate. Two consuls were elected {{for an annual}} term (from January through December) by the assembly of Roman soldiers, the Centuriate Assembly. After they were elected, they were granted imperium powers by the assembly. If a <b>consul</b> died before his term ended, another <b>consul</b> (the <b>consul</b> suffectus), was elected to complete the original consular term. Throughout the year, one <b>consul</b> was superior in rank to the other <b>consul.</b> This ranking flipped every month, between the two consuls. Once a consul's term ended, he held the honorary title of consulare {{for the rest of}} his time in the senate, and had to wait for ten years before standing for re-election to the consulship. Consuls had supreme power in both civil and military matters, which was due, in part, to the fact that they held the highest ordinary grade of imperium (command) powers. While in the city of Rome, the <b>consul</b> was the head of the Roman government. While components of public administration were delegated to other magistrates, the management of the government was under the ultimate authority of the <b>consul.</b> The consuls presided over the Roman Senate and the Roman assemblies, and had the ultimate responsibility to enforce policies and laws enacted by both institutions. The <b>consul</b> was the chief diplomat, carried out business with foreign nations, and facilitated interactions between foreign ambassadors and the senate. Upon an order by the senate, the <b>consul</b> was responsible for raising and commanding an army. While the consuls had supreme military authority, they had to be provided with financial resources by the Roman Senate while they were commanding their armies. While abroad, the <b>consul</b> had absolute power over his soldiers, and over any Roman province.|$|E

5|$|Meetings usually {{began at}} dawn, {{although}} occasionally certain events (such as festivals) might delay {{the beginning of}} a meeting. A magistrate who wished to summon the Senate had to issue a compulsory order (a cogere), and senators could be punished if they failed to appear without reasonable cause. In 44 BC for example, <b>consul</b> Mark Antony threatened to demolish the house of the former <b>consul</b> Cicero for this very reason. The Senate meetings were technically public because the doors were usually left open, which allowed people to look in, but only senators could speak. The Senate was directed by a presiding magistrate, who was usually either a <b>consul</b> (the highest-ranking magistrate) or, if the <b>consul</b> was unavailable, a Praetor (the second-highest ranking magistrate). By the late Republic, another type of magistrate, a plebeian tribune, would sometimes preside.|$|E
5|$|Strabo {{married into}} equally illustrious families. He may have married a {{daughter}} of Quintus Aelius Tubero, allying himself with the more prestigious Aelian gens. Lucius Seius Tubero, who became suffect <b>consul</b> in AD 18, was probably his son. Strabo's last wife was Cosconia Gallita, sister of Servius Cornelius Lentulus Maluginensis (suffect <b>consul</b> in AD 10) and Publius Cornelius Lentulus Scipio (suffect <b>consul</b> in AD 2) and perhaps half-sister of Quintus Junius Blaesus (suffect <b>consul</b> in AD 10). Sejanus {{could have been a}} child of this marriage. He was later adopted into the Aelian gens by Gaius Aelius Gallus, and by Roman custom became known as Lucius Aelius Seianus or simply as Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|The French {{crews of}} Henri IV {{received}} a telegraph from Admiral de Gueydon, {{suggesting that the}} bombardment of the city would begin soon, which the crews welcomed with enthusiasm. By then, a large crowd of people in Rabat and Salé had gathered to observe the French ships after they were spotted by Moroccan artillery operators. Admiral de Gueydon decided against starting the bombardment until <b>consul</b> Elton was aboard Caton; the <b>consul</b> did not come aboard the ship until four hours later. At dawn on 26 November though, the British steamer Janus joined Caton, and took the <b>consul</b> as its passenger.|$|E
50|$|Outside {{the walls}} of Rome, {{the powers of the}} <b>consuls</b> were far more {{extensive}} in their role as commanders-in-chief of all Roman legions. It was in this function that the <b>consuls</b> were vested with full imperium. When legions were ordered by a decree of the Senate, the <b>consuls</b> conducted the levy in the Campus Martius. Upon entering the army, all soldiers had to take their oath of allegiance to the <b>consuls.</b> The <b>consuls</b> also oversaw the gathering of troops provided by Rome’s allies.|$|R
50|$|Each year, two <b>consuls</b> {{were elected}} together, to serve for a one-year term. The <b>consuls</b> alternated in holding imperium each month, and a <b>consul's</b> imperium {{extended}} over Rome, Italy, and the provinces. However, after {{the establishment of}} the Empire (27 BC), the <b>consuls</b> became mere symbolic representatives of Rome’s republican heritage and held very little power and authority, with the Emperor acting as the supreme authority.|$|R

5|$|After {{his return}} to the Netherlands, H.P.N. Muller settled down in The Hague, where he was {{originally}} only occupied with his consular duties for Liberia, his membership of the Commission for Consular Examinations (since 1890) and his writing. Early in 1896 Muller was appointed as <b>consul</b> for the Orange Free State in the provinces of North and South Holland, assisting the <b>consul</b> general H.A.L. Hamelberg. He received the appointment on the strength of his publications about South Africa. After Hamelberg's death later in 1896 Muller succeeded him as <b>consul</b> general. It was an honorary position. In the following years Muller wholeheartedly set out to work for the Orange Free State and its interests in Europe. His predecessor Hamelberg had not only been <b>consul</b> general, but had on occasion also acted as special envoy to be able to negotiate treaties and accords with foreign powers. Muller also acted as special envoy and in this capacity inter alia enrolled the Orange Free State in the Universal Postal Union, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, and the Geneva Conventions, and negotiated treaties of friendship and trade with Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. He also strengthened the consular representation of the Orange Free State in Europe and inquired into all kinds of practical issues like a cure for rinderpest and improved methods of irrigation.|$|E

5|$|His {{great-grandfather}} was <b>Consul</b> in 36 BC (in replacement, and abdicated), and Governor of Asia in {{the same}} year. His grandfather became <b>Consul</b> Suffect in July of either 21 or 22, and {{was known as a}} personal friend of Emperor Tiberius (AD 14–37), accompanying the emperor during his voluntary seclusion on Capri from 23 onwards, dying in 33. Nerva's father, finally, attained the consulship in 40 under emperor Caligula (37–41). The Cocceii were connected with the Julio-Claudian dynasty through the marriage of Sergia Plautilla's brother Octavius Laenas, and Rubellia Bassa, the great-granddaughter of Tiberius.|$|E

50|$|Upon their return, {{the younger}} {{senators}} were {{highly critical of}} the <b>consuls</b> for what they said was a lack of courage, and called on them to resign. But the <b>consuls</b> told the senate that the disturbances were more serious and more advanced than the senate realised, and invited the senators to attend the forum to observe the difficulties faced by the <b>consuls</b> in enrolling the levies. The <b>consuls,</b> accompanied by some senators, then returned to the rostra, and called for the enrollment of one man of the people who the <b>consuls</b> knew was most unwilling to agree. The man, surrounded by his supporters, failed to respond. The <b>consuls</b> sent a lictor to seize the man, but the man's supporters threw the lictor back. The senators, shocked at this, went to help the lictor, but were also pushed away, and a greater disturbance was only averted by the timely intervention of the <b>consuls.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>consuls</b> were {{required}} to attend, leaving a praefectus urbi {{in charge of the}} city.

5|$|In Bottomley's absence, {{his office}} {{explored}} {{the issue and}} resolved that Rhodesia could retain its representative in South Africa, but {{should not be allowed}} to appoint another in Lisbon; a <b>consul</b> was acceptable, they concluded, but only as part of the British Embassy staff. Bottomley remained unaware of this progress until a call from his office on 25 June, whereupon he still did nothing. Unwilling to wait, Rhodesia confirmed Reedman's appointment the next day, much to Wilson's fury. Only now was Bottomley finally jolted into action; he informed Salisbury of his ministry's findings on 29 June, offering them the <b>consul</b> within the embassy, but refusing to sanction an independent office.|$|E

50|$|When the <b>consuls</b> {{were absent}} from Rome, leading their armies in {{campaign}} against the Aequi and the Volsci, Terentilius, tribune of the plebs, proposed a law creating a special commission charged with regulating consular power.

5|$|Since most {{senators}} were former magistrates, {{the senate}} became bound {{together by a}} strong sense of collegiality. At any given point in time, many of the senate's most senior members were ex-Consuls, which facilitated the creation of a bond between the presiding <b>Consul</b> and those senior members. In addition, the <b>Consul</b> was always chosen from senate, and as such he usually held similar ideals as did his fellow senators. When his annual term ended, he returned to their ranks, and so he was unlikely to stand against his fellow senators. Before the enactment of the Ovinian Law, Consuls appointed new senators, but after the enactment of this law, Censors appointed new senators, which caused the senate to become even more independent of the presiding <b>Consul.</b> In addition, the Ovinian Law all but required that ex-magistrates be appointed to the senate, and as such, the process by which Censors appointed new members to the senate became quite objective. This further enhanced the competence, and thus the prestige, of the senate.|$|E

5|$|The {{adoptive family}} of Sejanus counted two consuls among their ranks: Quintus Aelius Tubero (<b>consul</b> in 11 BC) and Sextus Aelius Catus (<b>consul</b> in AD 4), {{who was the}} father of Aelia Paetina, the second wife of the future Emperor Claudius.

5|$|The postwar climate sees {{a period}} of {{austerity}} and mistrust towards the machines. Returning from {{the horrors of the}} war, Marke becomes the <b>Consul</b> of Berlin and instates a reign of isolation and deurbanization. Advanced weapons are destroyed, people are driven out into the countryside to cultivate the land, and the giant energy accumulators are destroyed. Columns made to look like bulls are erected in city squares and at crossroads, and roar twice a day like a dying animal to remind people of the catastrophe of the Ural War. Marduk succeeds Marke as the <b>Consul</b> and continues the period of brutal authoritarian rule.|$|E
5|$|This {{period of}} calm {{came to an}} end when the British <b>consul</b> in Rio de Janeiro nearly sparked a war between Great Britain and Brazil. He sent an {{ultimatum}} containing abusive demands arising out of two minor incidents at the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862. The Brazilian government refused to yield, and the <b>consul</b> issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil prepared itself for the imminent conflict, and coastal defenses were given permission to fire upon any British warship that tried to capture Brazilian merchant ships. The Brazilian government then severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in March 494 BC, {{the elected}} <b>consuls</b> were Aulus Verginius Tricostus Caeliomontanus and Titus Veturius Geminus Cicurinus. Meanwhile the people held regular nightly meetings, {{sometimes}} on the Esquiline Hill {{and other times}} upon the Aventine Hill. The <b>consuls</b> got wind of these meetings, and put the matter before the senate. However the senate was so outraged that the <b>consuls</b> had not used the authority of their office to prevent these meetings {{that it was not}} at first possible to hold any vote. The senators rebuked the <b>consuls</b> for failing to act, and the <b>consuls</b> enquired as to the will of the senate. In response, the senate decreed that the army levies should be enrolled as quickly as possible, in order to distract the people from their sedition.|$|R
50|$|The {{need for}} a pool of men to fill the {{consular}} positions forced Augustus to remodel the suffect consulate, allowing more than the two elected for the ordinary consulate. During the reigns of the Julio-Claudians, the ordinary <b>consuls</b> who began the year usually relinquished their office mid-year, with the election for the suffect <b>consuls</b> occurring {{at the same time}} as that for the ordinary <b>consuls.</b> During reigns of the Flavian and Antonine emperors, the ordinary <b>consuls</b> tended to resign after a period of four months, and the elections were moved to 12 January of the year in which they were to hold office. Election of the <b>consuls</b> were transferred to the Senate during the Flavian or Antonine periods, although through to the 3rd century, the people were still called on to ratify the Senate’s selections.|$|R
