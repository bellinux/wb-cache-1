50|$|PTP {{irradiation}} capsules of {{each type}} must be designed such {{that they can be}} adequately cooled by the coolant flow available. Typical experiments contain a <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> load equivalent to that associated with 200 g of aluminum and 35 g of stainless steel distributed uniformly over a 20-in. (50.8-cm) length. PTP experiments containing <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> loads in excess of that described are discouraged because of their adverse effects on isotope production rates, fuel cycle length, and fuel element power distribution.|$|R
50|$|The {{buildup of}} {{short-lived}} fission products acting as nuclear poisons is called reactor poisoning, or xenon poisoning. Buildup of stable or long-lived <b>neutron</b> <b>poisons</b> is called reactor slagging.|$|R
50|$|Gadolinium(III) nitrate is an {{inorganic}} compound of gadolinium. It {{is used as}} a water-soluble <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> in nuclear reactors. Gadolinium nitrate, like all nitrates, is an oxidizing agent.|$|R
5|$|Like other lanthanides, many isotopes, {{especially}} isotopes with odd mass {{numbers and}} neutron-poor isotopes like 152Eu, have high cross sections for neutron capture, often {{high enough to}} be <b>neutron</b> <b>poisons.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractFast reactor {{spent fuel}} {{reprocessing}} plants should be designed for inherent criticality safety due to high plutonium content. Addition of soluble <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> {{is one way to}} do that. Gadolinium is the best choice based on neutron absorption cross section and chemical compatibility. In this work, using classical thermodynamic approach, the distribution coefficient of gadolinium in tributyl phosphate has been calculated and compared with the experimental data. The influence of acidity and uranium at equilibrium on gadolinium distribution in tributyl phosphate has been investigated. The result establishes the feasibility of employing gadolinium as soluble <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> in fast fuel reprocessing...|$|R
50|$|Soluble poisons {{are also}} used in {{emergency}} shutdown systems. During SCRAM the operators can inject solutions containing <b>neutron</b> <b>poisons</b> directly into the reactor coolant. Various solutions, including sodium polyborate and gadolinium nitrate (Gd(NO3)3·xH2O), are used.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, {{there were}} two shutdown/control rods {{composed}} of natural uranium and boron that was enriched in the boron-10 isotope. [...] 10B is a very effective <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> that could be inserted to control and shut down the reaction.|$|R
25|$|Reactors used {{in nuclear}} marine {{propulsion}} (especially nuclear submarines) often cannot be run at continuous power {{around the clock}} {{in the same way}} that land-based power reactors are normally run, and in addition often need to have a very long core life without refueling. For this reason many designs use highly enriched uranium but incorporate burnable <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> in the fuel rods. This allows the reactor to be constructed with an excess of fissionable material, which is nevertheless made relatively safe early in the reactor's fuel burn-cycle by the presence of the neutron-absorbing material which is later replaced by normally produced long-lived <b>neutron</b> <b>poisons</b> (far longer-lived than xenon-135) which gradually accumulate over the fuel load's operating life.|$|R
25|$|To control such {{a nuclear}} chain reaction, <b>neutron</b> <b>poisons</b> and <b>neutron</b> moderators {{can change the}} portion of {{neutrons}} that {{will go on to}} cause more fission. Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to shut the fission reaction down if monitoring detects unsafe conditions.|$|R

50|$|The isotope 135Cs {{is one of}} the {{long-lived}} {{fission products}} of uranium produced in nuclear reactors. However, this fission product yield is reduced in most reactors because the predecessor, 135Xe, is a potent <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> and frequently transmutes to stable 136Xe before it can decay to 135Cs.|$|R
50|$|Gadolinium nitrate {{was used}} at the Savannah River Site heavy water nuclear {{reactors}} {{and has to be}} separated from the heavy water for storage or reuse.The Canadian CANDU reactor, a pressurized heavy water reactor, also uses gadolinium nitrate as a water-soluble <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> in heavy water.|$|R
50|$|Samarium-149 is {{the second}} most {{important}} <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> in nuclear reactor physics. Samarium-151, produced at lower yields, is the third most abundant medium-lived fission product but emits only weak beta radiation. Both have high neutron absorption cross-sections, so that much of them produced in a reactor are later destroyed there by neutron absorption.|$|R

40|$|The {{discovery}} of a historical bug in the s-post-process AGB code obtained so far by the Torino group forced us to reconsider the role of primary 16 O in the 13 C-pocket, produced by the 13 C(a, n) 16 O reaction, as important <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> for the build up of the s-elements at Halo metallicities. The effect is noticeable only for the highest 13 C-pocket efficiencies (cases ST* 2 and ST). For Galactic disc metallicities, the bug effect is negligible. A comparative analysis of the <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> effect of other primary isotopes (12 C, 22 Ne and its progenies) is presented. The effect of proton captures, by 14 N(n, p) 14 C, boosts a primary production of Fluorine in Halo AGB stars, with [F/Fe] comparable to [C/Fe], without affecting the s-elements production.

25|$|Molten salt reactor designs {{carry out}} {{fluoride}} volatility reprocessing continuously or at frequent intervals. The {{goal is to}} return actinides to the molten fuel mixture for eventual fission, while removing fission products that are <b>neutron</b> <b>poisons,</b> or that can be more securely stored outside the reactor core while awaiting eventual transfer to permanent storage.|$|R
50|$|Normally, {{the heat}} flux from neutron and gamma heating {{at the surface}} of the capsule is limited to 74,000 Btu/h-ft² (2.3 x 105 W/m²). Furthermore, the <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> content of the {{facility}} load is limited such that the reactor cannot be tripped by a significant reactivity change upon insertion and removal of the samples.|$|R
50|$|Six {{irradiation}} positions {{located in}} the permanent reflector {{are referred to as}} the large vertical experiment facilities. These facilities are similar in all respects (as to characteristics and capabilities) to the small vertical experiment facilities described in the preceding section except for location and size. The aluminum liners in the large VXFs have an inside diameter of 2.834 in. (7.20 cm), and the facilities are located concentric with the core on a circle of radius 18.23 in. (46.3 cm). When not in use, these facilities contain beryllium or aluminum plugs.Large <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> loads in these facilities are of no particular concern with respect to fuel element power distribution perturbations or effects on fuel cycle length because of their distance from the core; however, experiments are carefully reviewed with respect to their <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> content, which is limited to minimize their effect on adjacent neutron scattering beam tubes.|$|R
40|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} {{contains}} fissionable materials ({sup 235 }U, {sup 239 }Pu, {sup 241 }Pu, etc.). Neutron multiplication {{and the potential}} for criticality are enhanced by the presence of a moderator during cask loading in water, water incursion in accidents conditions during spent fuel storage or transport. To prevent nuclear criticality in spent fuel storage, transportation, and during disposal, neutron-absorbing materials (or <b>neutron</b> <b>poisons,</b> such as borated stainless steel, Boral{trademark}, Metamic{trademark}, Ni-Gd, and others) would have to be applied. The success in demonstrating that the High-Performance Corrosion-Resistant material (HPCRM) can be thermally applied as coating onto base metal to provide for corrosion resistance for many naval applications raises the interest in applying the HPCRM to USDOE/OCRWM spent fuel management program. The fact that the HPCRM relies on the high content of boron to make the material amorphous [...] an essential property for corrosion resistance [...] and that the boron has to be homogeneously distributed in the HPCRM qualify the material to be a <b>neutron</b> <b>poison...</b>|$|R
50|$|Isotopes {{with a large}} scatter {{cross section}} and have a low mass are good neutron moderators (see chart below). Nuclides which have a large {{absorption}} cross section are <b>neutron</b> <b>poisons</b> if they are neither fissile nor undergo decay. A poison that is purposely inserted into a nuclear reactor for controlling its reactivity {{in the long term}} and improve its shutdown margin is called a burnable poison.|$|R
50|$|Eight large {{diameter}} irradiation {{positions are}} located in the removable beryllium (RB) near the control region. These facilities are designated as RB-1A and -1B, RB-3A and -3B, RB-5A and -5B, and RB-7A and -7B. These are generally referred to as the RB* positions. The vertical centerline of these facilities is located 10.75 in. (27.31 cm) from the vertical centerline of the reactor and they are lined with a permanent aluminum liner having an inside diameter of 1.811 in. (4.6 cm). These facilities are designed for either instrumented or non-instrumented experiments. The instrumented capsule design can also employ sweep or cooling gases as necessary. Instrument leads and access tubes are accommodated through penetrations in the upper shroud flange and through special penetrations in the pressure vessel hatch.When not in use, these facilities contain beryllium or aluminum plugs. Because of their close proximity to the fuel, RB* experiments are carefully reviewed with respect to their <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> content, which is limited because of its effect on fuel element power distribution and fuel cycle length.These positions can accommodate (i.e., shielded) experiments, making them well suited for fusion materials irradiation.Uses for the RB* facilities have included the production of radioisotopes; High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (HTGR) fuel irradiations; and the irradiation of candidate fusion reactor materials. The later type of experiment requires a fast neutron flux. A significant fast flux is present in addition to the thermal flux. For this application the capsules are placed in a liner containing a thermal <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> for spectral-tailoring. These experiments are carefully reviewed with respect to their <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> content and limited to certain positions to minimize their effect on adjacent neutron scattering beam tubes.|$|R
5000|$|CFBR designs {{mentions}} a new {{and improved}} decay heat removal (DHR) system, reactor shutdown system from its predecessor PFBR. Passive safety features include new Hydraulically Suspended Absorber Rods (HSAR) which fall into the core {{under the influence of}} gravity if coolant flow is lost, and the inclusion of an Ultimate Shutdown System (USD) which would use pressurized gas to forcefully inject <b>neutron</b> <b>poisons</b> directly into the core to halt re-criticality incidents.|$|R
50|$|Liquid neutron {{absorbers}} {{are also}} used in rapid shutdown systems for light water reactors. Following a SCRAM, if the reactor (or section(s) thereof) are not below the shutdown margin (that is, they could return to a critical state due to insertion of positive reactivity from cooling, poison decay, or other uncontrolled conditions), the operators can inject solutions containing <b>neutron</b> <b>poisons</b> directly into the reactor coolant. <b>Neutron</b> <b>poisons</b> are water-based solutions that contain <b>chemicals</b> that absorb <b>neutrons,</b> such as common household borax, sodium polyborate, boric acid, or gadolinium nitrate, causing a decrease in neutron multiplication, and thus shutting down the reactor without use of the control rods. In the PWR, these neutron absorbing solutions are stored in pressurized tanks (called accumulators) that {{are attached to the}} primary coolant system via valves; a varying level of neutron absorbent is kept within the primary coolant at all times, and is increased using the accumulators {{in the event of a}} failure of all of the control rods to insert, which will promptly bring the reactor below the shutdown margin. In the BWR, soluble neutron absorbers are found within the Standby Liquid Control System (SLCS), which uses redundant battery-operated injection pumps, or, in the latest models, high pressure nitrogen gas to inject the neutron absorber solution into the reactor vessel against any pressure within. Because they may delay the restart of a reactor, these systems are only used to shut down the reactor if control rod insertion fails. This concern is especially significant in a BWR, where injection of liquid boron would cause precipitation of solid boron compounds on fuel cladding, which would prevent the reactor from restarting until the boron deposits were removed.|$|R
40|$|Non-{{radioactive}} cerium (Ce) and radioactive plutonium (Pu) {{anion exchange}} column experiments using scaled HB-Line designs {{were performed to}} investigate the feasibility of using either gadolinium nitrate (Gd) or boric acid (B as H{sub 3 }BO{sub 3 }) as a <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> in the H-Canyon dissolution process. Expected typical concentrations of probable impurities were tested {{and the removal of}} these impurities by a decontamination wash was measured. Impurity concentrations are compared to two specifications - designated as Column A or Column B (most restrictive) - proposed for plutonium oxide (PuO{sub 2 }) product shipped to the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF). Use of Gd as a <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> requires a larger volume of wash for the proposed Column A specification. Since boron (B) has a higher proposed specification and is more easily removed by washing, it appears to be the better candidate for use in the H-Canyon dissolution process. Some difficulty was observed in achieving the Column A specification due to the limited effectiveness that the wash step has in removing the residual B after {approx} 4 BV's wash. However a combination of the experimental 10 BV's wash results and a calculated DF from the oxalate precipitation process yields an overall DF sufficient to meet the Column A specification. For those impurities (other than B) not removed by 10 BV's of wash, the impurity is either not expected to be present in the feedstock or process, or recommendations have been provided for improvement in the analytical detection/method or validation of calculated results. In summary, boron is recommended as the appropriate <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> for H-Canyon dissolution and impurities are expected to meet the Column A specification limits for oxide production in HB-Line...|$|R

50|$|As {{regard to}} the {{mechanism}} for pulsing the core, the pulsed mode can be produced using a different variety of configurations depending of the desired frequency of the pulsations. For instance, the use of standard control rods in a single or banked configuration with motor driving mechanism {{or the use of}} standard pneumatically operated pulsing mechanisms are suitable for generating up to 10 pulses per minute, for the production of pulses at rates up to 50 pulsations per second, the use of rotating wheels introducing alternately <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> and fuel or <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> and non-neutron poison can be considered. However, for pulsations ranking the thousands of pulses per second (kHz), optical choppers or modern wheels employing magnetic bearings allow to revolve at 10 kHz. If even fast pulsations are desired, then, it would be necessary the use of a new type of pulsing mechanism that does not involve mechanical motion, for example, lasers (based in the 3He polarization) as early proposed by Bowman, or proton and neutron beams. For the nuclear thermal rocket frequencies in the order of 1 kHz to 10 kHz are the choice.|$|R
40|$|The {{neutron capture}} cross {{sections}} of light nuclei (A< 56) {{are important for}} s-process scenarios since they act as <b>neutron</b> <b>poisons.</b> We report on measurements of the neutron capture cross sections of K 41 and Sc 45, which were performed at the Karlsruhe 3. 7 MV Van de Graaff accelerator via the activation method in a quasistellar neutron spectrum corresponding to a thermal energy of kT= 25 keV. Systematic effects were controlled by repeated irradiations, resulting in overall uncertainties of less than 3 %. The measured spectrum-averaged data {{have been used to}} normalize the energy-dependent (n,γ) cross sections from the main data libraries JEFF- 3. 2, JENDL- 4. 0, and ENDF/B-VII. 1, and a set of Maxwellian averaged cross sections was calculated for improving the s-process nucleosynthesis yields in AGB stars and in massive stars. At kT= 30 keV, the new Maxwellian averaged cross sections of K 41 and Sc 45 are 19. 2 ± 0. 6 mb and 61. 3 ± 1. 8 mb, respectively. Both values are 20 % lower than previously recommended. The effect of <b>neutron</b> <b>poisons</b> is discussed for nuclei with A< 56 in general and for the investigated isotopes in particular...|$|R

The evaluation shows {{that there are no}} criticality concerns with cementitious grout but a <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> such as boron would be required {{for the use of the}} paraffin matrix...|$|R
50|$|A <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> (also {{called a}} neutron {{absorber}} or a nuclear poison) is a substance {{with a large}} neutron absorption cross-section, in applications such as nuclear reactors. In such applications, absorbing neutrons is normally an undesirable effect. However neutron-absorbing materials, also called poisons, are intentionally inserted into some types of reactors in order to lower the high reactivity of their initial fresh fuel load. Some of these poisons deplete as they absorb neutrons during reactor operation, while others remain relatively constant.|$|R
50|$|A non-burnable poison is {{one that}} {{maintains}} a constant negative reactivity worth {{over the life of}} the core. While no <b>neutron</b> <b>poison</b> is strictly non-burnable, certain materials can be treated as non-burnable poisons under certain conditions. One example is hafnium. The removal (by absorption of neutrons) of one isotope of hafnium leads to the production of another neutron absorber, and continues through a chain of five absorbers. This absorption chain results in a long-lived burnable poison which approximates non-burnable characteristics.|$|R
50|$|Fission {{products}} and actinides produced by neutron absorption of nuclear fuel itself are normally {{referred to by}} those specific names, and activation product reserved for products of neutron capture by other materials, such as structural components of the nuclear reactor or nuclear bomb, the reactor coolant, control rods or other <b>neutron</b> <b>poisons,</b> or materials in the environment. All of these, however, need to be handled as radioactive waste. Some nuclides originate {{in more than one}} way, as activation products or fission products.|$|R
