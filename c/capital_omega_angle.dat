5000|$|PREDITOR (PREDIction of TORsion angles) is a freely {{available}} web-server for {{the prediction}} of protein torsion angles from chemical shifts. For many years it has been known that protein chemical shifts are sensitive to protein secondary structure, which in turn, is sensitive to backbone torsion angles. torsion angles are internal coordinates {{that can be used}} to describe the conformation of a polypeptide chain. They can also be used as constraints to help determine or refine protein structures via NMR spectroscopy. In proteins there are four major torsion angles of interest: phi, psi, omega and chi-1. Traditionally protein NMR spectroscopists have used vicinal J-coupling information and the Karplus relation to determine approximate backbone torsion angle constraints for phi and chi-1 angles. However, several studies in the early 1990s pointed out the strong relationship between 1H and 13C chemical shifts and torsion angles, especially with backbone phi and psi angles. Later a number of other papers pointed out additional chemical shift relationships with chi-1 and even <b>omega</b> <b>angles.</b> PREDITOR was designed to exploit these experimental observations and to help NMR spectroscopists easily predict protein torsion angles from chemical shift assignments. Specifically, PREDITOR accepts protein sequence and/or chemical shift data as input and generates torsion angle predictions for phi, psi, <b>omega</b> and chi-1 <b>angles.</b> The algorithm that PREDITOR uses combines sequence alignment, chemical shift alignment and a number of related chemical shift analysis techniques to predict torsion angles. PREDITOR is unusually fast (<40 s per protein) and exhibits a very high level of accuracy. In a series of tests 88% of PREDITOR’s phi/psi predictions were within 30 degrees of the correct values, 84% of chi-1 predictions (3-state predictions) were correct and 99.97% of PREDITOR’s predicted <b>omega</b> <b>angles</b> were correct. PREDITOR also estimates the torsion angle errors so that its torsion angle constraints can be used with standard protein structure refinement software, such as CYANA, CNS, XPLOR and AMBER. PREDITOR also supports automated protein chemical shift re-referencing and {{the prediction of}} proline cis/trans states. PREDITOR is not the only torsion angle prediction software available. Several other computer programs including TALOS, TALOS+ [...] and DANGLE [...] have also been developed to predict backbone torsion angles from protein chemical shifts. These stand-alone programs exhibit similar prediction performance to PREDITOR but are substantially slower.|$|R
40|$|Every {{year between}} 500 and 1000 peptide and protein {{structures}} {{are determined by}} NMR and deposited into the Protein Data Bank. However, the process of NMR structure determination {{continues to be a}} manually intensive and time-consuming task. One of the most tedious and error-prone aspects of this process involves the determination of torsion angle restraints including phi, psi, <b>omega</b> and chi <b>angles.</b> Most methods require many days of additional experiments, painstaking measurements or complex calculations. Here we wish to describe a web server, called PREDITOR, which greatly accelerates and simplifies this task. PREDITOR accepts sequence and/or chemical shift data as input and generates torsion angle predictions (with predicted errors) for phi, psi, omega and chi- 1 angles. PREDITOR combines sequence alignment methods with advanced chemical shift analysis techniques to generate its torsion angle predictions. The method is fast (, 40 s per protein) and accurate, with 88 % of phi/psi predictions being within 30 of the correct values, 84 % of chi- 1 predictions being correct and 99. 97 % of <b>omega</b> <b>angles</b> being correct. PREDITOR is 35 times faster and up to 20 % more accurate than any existing method. PREDITOR also provides accurate assessments of the torsion angle errors so that the torsion angle constraints can be readily fed into standard structure refinement programs, such as CNS, XPLOR, AMBER and CYANA. Other unique features to PREDITOR include dihedral angle prediction via PDB structure mapping, automated chemical shift re-referencing (to improve accuracy), prediction of proline cis/ trans states and a simple user interface.

40|$|Abstract: The {{goals of}} this article are to (1) provide further {{validation}} of the Glycam 06 force field, specifically for its use in implicit solvent molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, and (2) to present the extension of G. N. Rama-chandran’s idea of plotting amino acid phi and psi angles to the glycosidic phi, psi, and <b>omega</b> <b>angles</b> formed between carbohydrates. As in traditional Ramachandran plots, these carbohydrate Ramachandran-type (carb-Rama) plots reveal the coupling between the glycosidic angles by displaying the allowed and disallowed conformational space. Considering two-bond glycosidic linkages, there are 18 possible conformational regions that can be defined by (a, /, w) and (b, /, w), whereas for three-bond linkages, there are 54 possible regions that can be defined by (a, /, w, x) and (b, /, w, x). Illustrating these ideas are molecular dynamic simulations on an implicitly hydrated oli-gosaccharide (700 ns) and its eight constituent disaccharides (50 ns/disaccharide). For each linkage, we compare and contrast the oligosaccharide and respective disaccharide carb-Rama plots, validate the simulations and the Glycam 06 force field through comparison to experimental data, and discuss the general trends observed in the plots...|$|R

METHODS: We prospectively included 350 individuals and evaluated 188 asymptomatic hips that underwent semiautomated CT analysis. Different thresholds of alpha angle (α°) were considered in order to analyze cam morphology and determine Ω°. We calculated overall and gender-specific parameters for imaging signs of cam morphology (Ω° and circumferential α°). RESULTS: The 95 % reference interval limits were beyond abnormal thresholds {{found in the literature}} for cam morphology. Specifically, α° at 3 / 1 o´clock were 46. 9 °/ 60. 8 ° overall, 51. 8 °/ 65. 4 ° for men and 45. 7 °/ 55. 3 ° for women. Cam prevalence, magnitude, location, and epicenter were significantly gender different. Increasing α° correlated with higher Ω°, meaning that higher angles correspond to larger cam deformities. CONCLUSION: Hip morphometry measurements in this cohort of asymptomatic individuals extended beyond current thresholds used for the clinical diagnosis of cam deformity, and α° was found to vary both by gender and measurement location. These results suggest that α° measurement is insufficient for the diagnosis of cam deformity. Enhanced morphometric evaluation, including 3 D imaging and Ω°, may enable a more accurate diagnosis. KEY POINTS: • 95 % reference interval limits of cam morphotype were beyond currently defined thresholds. • Current morphometric definitions for cam-type morphotype should be applied with care. • Cam prevalence, magnitude, location, and epicenter are significantly gender different. • Cam and alpha angle thresholds should be defined according to sex/location. • Quantitative 3 D morphometric assessment allows thorough and reproducible FAI diagnosis and monitoring. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|The {{basic unit}} of the peptide, the CONH bond, is {{responsible}} for imparting specific secondary structural features to peptides. Many modifications, such as isosteric/bioisosteric replacement of this basic unit, {{have been made to}} alter the properties of peptides. Isosteric replacement of the nitrogen atom by boron (boron peptides) is another plausible way of changing peptide characteristics. Like N-methylacetamide (NMA), acetylmethylborane, or BMA, is a good model for studying boron peptides. The potential energy surface (PES) of BMA has been studied by Hartree-Fock (HF), density functional theory (DFT), and post-HF methods. The PES of BMA is an inverted form of the NMA hypersurface. Two minima and two saddle points of index 1 have been identified on this PES and fully optimized at the HF, Becke 2 ̆ 7 s three-parameter exchange functional and the gradient-corrected functional of Lee, Yang, and Paar, second-order Møller-Plesset (full), and quadratic configuration interaction method with single and double substitutions followed by a perturbative treatment of triple substitutions (QCISD) levels of theory. The minima correspond to structures with omega values close to 90 ° and 270 °, and the transition states have omega values around 0 ° and 180 °. The energy barrier for rotation around the omega bond is found to be 4. 3 kcal/mol at the QCISD/ 6 - 31 G* level, which is much lower than the 16 - 23 kcal/mol barrier in NMA. The unique shape of the PES of BMA and the low barrier to rotation can be well explained by second-order orbital interaction studies. Normal-mode analysis reveals a significant shift in the BH stretching frequency of BMA from that in alkyl boranes and borane-phosphine complexes. The replacement of nitrogen by boron bestows on such peptides greater proteolytic stability, more flexibility around the <b>omega</b> <b>angle,</b> and a unique preference for positive angles, all of which are absent in peptides of natural origin...|$|R

The potential energy surface of NMAOH and BMAOH has been built at the HF, B 3 LYP, and MP 2 levels of theory with the 6 - 31 +G* basis set. The minima and transition states for rotations about various torsional angles have been located, and the energy barriers have been estimated. The global minimum energy structure of both peptides exhibits an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen and the hydroxyl group, imparting a conformational rigidity to the peptides. The omega rotation barrier is lower in the boron isostere than in NMAOH. The difference in the rotation barrier {{has been attributed to}} second-order orbital interactions, like negative hyperconjugation, as revealed by NBO calculations. In contrast, the rotation barrier around the torsion angle tau (torsion governing rotation about the N−O and B−O bonds) is relatively higher in the boron analogue. This difference is due to the double bond character in the B−O bond as opposed to the N−O bond which has the character of a single bond. As an extension, N-acetyl-N‘-hydroxy-N‘-methylamide of alanine (Ala-NOH) and its boron isostere (Ala-BOH) have been adopted as model peptides to study the conformational preferences about the phi and ψ torsion angles.

Our results show that peptides deviate more from planarity than previous studies have detected, and in fact, are not even planar on average. Additionally, our data show, in agreement with early small molecule and peptide research, that the nitrogen atom in prolyl peptides is generally pyramidalized, and plays an almost equal role in generating deviations from planarity as does pure rotation. Correlation analyses show that local conformational features only explain {{a small fraction of the}} variability in planarity in real structures. We conclude that the tertiary environment exerts a dominant influence on non-planarity...|$|R
40|$|Matrix-isolation IR and UV {{spectra of}} Si 3 H 8, i-Si 4 H 10, {{and the two}} conformers of n-Si 4 H 10 have been recorded. A {{quantitative}} separation of the IR spectrum of n-Si 4 H 10 into contributions from the anti and gauche forms was accomplished {{by a combination of}} matrix annealing and selective monochromatic photodestruction experiments. A qualitative separation of their UV spectra was achieved as well. The IR spectra of Si 3 H 8, i-Si 4 H 10, and the two conformers of n-Si 4 H 10 have been assigned by comparison with results of ab initio calculations, which reproduce the frequencies and even the relative intensities quite well. The calculations predict dihedral <b>angles</b> <b>omega</b> of 180 degrees and 57 degrees for the anti and the gauche conformer of n-Si 4 H 10, respectively, and confirm earlier predictions of nearly equal stability for an isolated molecule. In the matrix, the anti conformer is more stable, The conformational effects on the UV spectrum of n-Si 4 H 10 are not those anticipated from simple models of the Sandorfy or ladder C type, in that it is primarily not the energy but the intensity of the low-energy excited singlet states that depends strongly on the SiSiSiSi dihedral <b>angle</b> <b>omega.</b> This result is interpreted in terms of data from 6 -in- 8 CASSCF 6 - 31 G* calculations, which predict an avoided crossing between a strongly allowed sigma sigma* B state and a very weakly allowed sigma pi* B state as omega changes, with the former lower in energy at 180 degrees and the latter lower at 0 degrees. Consequences for attempts to understand the effects of conformation on optical spectra of polysilanes are noted...|$|R
