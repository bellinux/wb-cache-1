50|$|The {{efficiency}} of detection of a G-M tube {{varies with the}} type of incident radiation. Tubes with thin end windows have very high efficiencies (can be nearly 100%) for high energy beta, though this drops off as the beta energy decreases due to attenuation by the window material. Alpha particles are also attenuated by the window. As alpha particles have a maximum range of less than 50 mm in air, the detection window should be {{as close as possible to}} the source of radiation. The attenuation of the window adds to the attenuation of air, so the window should have a density as low as 1.5 to 2.0 mg/cm2 to give an acceptable level of detection efficiency.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Counting radioisotopes in {{microplates}} requires special {{technology to}} <b>count</b> with good <b>efficiency</b> and negligible crosstalk between wells. In the TopCountTM Microplate Scintillation Counter, we use time-resolved counting technology to achieve high <b>counting</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and low backgrounds {{with a single}} photomultiplier tube (PMT), which collects light {{from the top of}} the microplate well. We developed liquid and solid scintillants that produce slowly decaying pulse trains, and the electronics to discriminate true beta disintegration events from noise based on the pulse characteristics. Crosstalk is prevented by the basic design of the instrument and the use of opaque, reflective microplates. Crosstalk from 'H or 14 C is not measurable above background, whereas crosstalk from penetrating radiation, such as "I or 32 P, is measurable, but only a fraction of a percent. With the virtual absence of crosstalk, sample spectra are not corrupted by small crosstalk pulses, and the sample spectra (tSIS) can be used for reliable quench correction.
