40|$|We {{employed}} the Generational Accounting model in estimating the generation-specific lifetime (both {{past and the}} future) benefits/burdens and income and evaluating their values as of 2010, thus estimating the lifetime net burden ratio (= lifetime net burden/lifetime income). As a result, the following points were elucidated: 1) Among the <b>current</b> living <b>generations,</b> the lifetime net burden ratio of the 0 -year-old generation is about 25 percentage points {{higher than that of}} the current 90 -year-old generation; 2) The lifetime net burden ratio of the future generations is about 31 percentage points higher than that of the 0 -year-old generation; 3) The net burden of the <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> would have to be increased in order to narrow the generational gap between the <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> and the future generations, which would inevitably lead to an expansion of the intragenerational gap of the current generations; and 4) In order to prevent conflict of interest between the <b>current</b> <b>generations,</b> in particular the younger generations and future generations, and at the same time, narrow the intergenerational gap, it is desirable to increase the income of the <b>current</b> <b>generations,</b> in particular that of the younger generations, by achieving a high economic growth rate and implementing macroeconomic policy management that would inhibit increase in the risk premium included in the interest rate...|$|R

According to Sharma, the ceremony {{is central to the}} concept of lineages. Shraddha involves oblations to three preceding generationsby reciting their namesas well as to the mythical lineage ancestor (gotra). A person thus gets to know the names of six generations (three preceding generation, his own and two succeeding generationshis sons and grandsons) in his life, reaffirming lineage ties. Anthropologist Usha Menon of Drexel University presents a similar ideathat Pitru Paksha emphasises the fact that the ancestors and the <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> and their next unborn generation are connected by blood ties.

40|$|Despite the oft-heard {{claims that}} <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> are {{stealing}} from future generations by running fiscal deficits, both theory and evidence {{suggest that this}} is either not true or not knowable. Intergenerational justice is not an appropriate lens through which to analyze fiscal issues, {{because there is no}} obvious starting point from which to build a moral consensus about whether <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> owe anything at all to future generations - and even if we do believe that we owe something to future generations, no one has offered a useful method by which we can determine whether we are doing enough for our progeny. Moreover, if we believe that future generations should be made better off than <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> (2 ̆ 2 I want my kids to be richer than I am. 2 ̆ 2), even pessimistic forecasts indicate that future generations will be much wealthier than <b>current</b> <b>generations,</b> meaning that we are already being quite generous to our children and grandchildren. In addition, the recent significant decline in our economic prospects does not argue for a more contractionary fiscal policy in light of concerns about future generations. In fact, when times are bad, there is no conflict between the interests of <b>current</b> and future <b>generations.</b> Spending by the government helps to improve the economy, which encourages businesses to invest in future productivity.

It shows that a cut in PAYG pensions is efficiency-improving, but hurts the lower income groups of <b>current</b> <b>generations.</b> This effect can be ameliorated by a debt-financed cut in indirect taxes. In that case the negative welfare effect of the reform for <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> is smaller than the redistribution caused by the demographic shift itself...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates how <b>current</b> {{and future}} <b>generations</b> are {{affected}} by commitment-based Nash equilibrium environmental strategies when the environmental absorption efficiency is susceptible to switch from a pollution sink to a source. We formulate a two-player differential game model of transboundary pollution that includes the environmental absorption efficiency as a state variable that can be enhanced thanks to restoration efforts. Based on a logarithmic specification for the instantaneous revenue function, we characterize the cooperative solution and the commitment-based Nash equilibrium strategy, and examine their differences in terms of steady state and transient behavior. We notably show that a commitment-based Nash equilibrium strategy {{makes it possible to}} prevent a definitive switching of the environmental absorption efficiency from a pollution sink to a source but imposes greater economic sacrifices on <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> than on future generations. In comparison, the cooperative solution imposes greater sacrifices on <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> in terms of revenues but it imposes lower environmental costs on both <b>current</b> and future <b>generations</b> than commitment-based Nash equilibrium strategy...|$|R

25|$|One of the {{mechanisms}} for compensation {{is impossible for}} this problem: mitigation might benefit future generations {{at the expense of}} <b>current</b> <b>generations,</b> but {{there is no way that}} future <b>generations</b> can compensate <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> for the costs of mitigation. On the other hand, should future generations bear most of the costs of climate change, compensation to them would not be possible. Another transfer for compensation exists between regions and populations.

40|$|Despite {{widely held}} beliefs that <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> bear heavy {{obligations}} {{to look out}} for the welfare of future generations, the philosophical case in support of such intergenerational obligations is surprisingly tentative. Moreover, quantifying any such obligations is subject to even greater uncertainty. Even so, <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> bring future generations into existence in the knowledge that doing so will put a claim on resources that could have been used to reduce suffering among people who are already alive. The choice to allow living people to suffer and die, and instead to bring forth more people in the future, thus implies a moral imperative to provide a life for future generations that is worth living. Many policies—such as so-called green technologies—that could improve the lives of future generations could bring about greater prosperity for <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> as well. The potentially difficult policy choices are those that represent a clear trade-off: decreasing future generations’ living standards as a means of providing <b>current</b> and future <b>generations</b> with a better environment. Because future material living standards are projected—even under the most pessimistic scenarios—to be much higher than living standards today, it is possible to give future generations both a better environment and a much higher material standard of living than people enjoy today. Claiming that proenvironmental policies will harm future generations, therefore, amounts to observing that {{it would be possible to}} give future generations even higher incomes—along with a dirty planet. We should, therefore, not be hesitant to transform some future material prosperity into an inheritance that will truly benefit future generations: a livable world...|$|R
30|$|There {{are many}} types of tidal <b>current</b> power <b>generation</b> devices, and it is {{necessary}} to make comprehensive evaluation of tidal <b>current</b> power <b>generation</b> devices in order to provide valuable reference for the improvement of their performance indexes. On the basis of the analysis of the tidal <b>current</b> power <b>generation</b> device performance indexes, the hierarchical model for comprehensive evaluation of device performance is given in this paper. By normalizing the membership matrix elements based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model, all the values of the matrix elements are restrained in the range of 0.0 to 1.0, hence the complexity of the calculations is reduced. Vector similarity is used to determine the expert weights which reflect the knowledge and experience of the experts. This paper presents an improved method for rank correlation analysis, and calculates the comprehensive weight value and the final evaluation results of tidal <b>current</b> power <b>generation</b> devices. The presented method improves the credibility of the evaluation. In the end, measured data of two units of tidal <b>current</b> power <b>generation</b> devices are evaluated in the paper, and the effectiveness of the presented method is verified.|$|R
