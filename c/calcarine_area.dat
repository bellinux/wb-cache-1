40|$|PURPOSE: To study MR {{images for}} atrophic {{changes in the}} <b>calcarine</b> <b>area</b> {{resulting}} from retinal degeneration. METHODS: MR images from nine patients with retinal degeneration confirmed by ophthalmologic examination and from 30 healthy volunteers were reviewed. The causes of retinal degeneration were hereditary pigmentary degeneration of the retina (four patients), high myopia (two patients), and chorioretinal atrophy (three patients); all patients had visual disturbances and visual field abnormalities. To estimate the morphological changes of the <b>calcarine</b> <b>area,</b> the widths of {{the right and left}} calcarine fissures were measured on T 1 -weighted sagittal images and compared with images from age-matched control subjects. RESULTS: The calcarine fissures were significantly dilated in the patients with retinal degeneration. The anterior and middle points, which represent the peripheral visual field center, were more dilated than the posterior point. CONCLU-SION: The MR findings suggested calcarine atrophy related to retinal degeneration. Transneuronal degenerative changes may occur in the <b>calcarine</b> <b>area</b> after retinal degeneration.

40|$|A 66 -year-old Taiwanese {{aboriginal}} male {{had complained}} of right-side blurred vision for 2 months, especially when reading. He had a 10 -year history of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20 / 25 in each eye. Ophthalmoscopy revealed asymmetrical cupping, but a normal disc. Humphrey perimetry showed an upper homonymous para-central quadrantanopic defect. Brain {{magnetic resonance imaging}} showed an infarction in the left lower <b>calcarine</b> <b>area</b> over the extrastriate (V 2 /V 3) cortical area and a narrowing of the left middle and posterior cerebral arteries due to severe arteriosclerosis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractStructural {{changes of}} the brain have been {{detected}} in many early-onset eye diseases, whereas {{little is known about}} whether changes could occur if the onset age is after the sensitive development period. High Myopia {{is a prime example of}} neural plasticity after development, whose case history is usually long. To investigate potential morphological changes in the brain of high myopic patients, we compared a group of 30 adults with high myopia and 30 control subjects using high-resolution anatomic MRI in combination with vision tests. No difference in gray matter (GM) concentration was detected. However, increased concentration of white matter (WM) was observed in patients with high myopia, primarily in the <b>calcarine</b> <b>area.</b> Another three comparatively smaller regions were in the prefrontal and parietal lobe. It can be inferred that cortices developed normally and refractive error in high myopic patients may be compensated by strengthening the correlation between visual cortex and visual related areas. Our study suggests that besides early-onset diseases, the late-onset eye diseases can also affect the structure of brain...|$|E
40|$|The {{representation}} of the visual field in the striate cortex (<b>calcarine</b> cortex, <b>area</b> 17) has received considerable attention. It is agreed that central vision is predominantly represented posteriorly and peripheral vision predominantly anteriorly, but the detailed representation is debated. Holmes (1918) from his study of head injuries {{in the first world}} war concluded that concentric zones from the fixation point to the periphery are represented serially in that order from the posterior to the anterior part of the calcarine cortex. Brouwer (1934) took the same view except that he believed that the area devoted to central vision protruded forward a considerable distance as a tongue in the intermediate part of the striate cortex between it...|$|R
40|$|To {{start by}} looking back a little, recall {{that even a}} small brain lesion, if {{critically}} located in the left or language hemisphere, may selectively destroy a person's ability to read, {{while at the same}} time sparing speech and the ability to converse. The printed page continues to be seen, but the words have lost their meaning. This condition typically follows from focal damage to the angular gyrus in the left hemisphere. It also results from lesions interruptingt he neural input to this left angular gyrus from the visual or <b>calcarine</b> cortical <b>areas</b> (1, 2). It is natural to conclude in such cases that the left hemisphere is responsible for reading while the undamaged right hemisphere, in contrast, must be "wordblind" or incapable of seeing meaning in the printed word...|$|R
40|$|In {{the study}} of the human cortex it seems well to follow the same primary {{divisions}} for the entire cortex, while in certain areas some layers may assume certain modifications; viz., in the area striata it seems clearer to retain the sixth layer ground type, of which the fourth is subdivided into three secondary layers. The visual cortex, on account of its relation to the act of seeing, is an especially interesting field for study. About the calcarine fissure one can readily see with the naked eye a stripe of white fibers lying in the gray substance, called stria of Gennari or of Vicq-d' Azyr. This layer is considered by Brodmann in the second subdivision of the fourth primary layer. The two most characteristic types of the cortex are the giant pyramid type, called area gigantopyramidalis, and the <b>calcarine</b> type, called <b>area</b> striata. The higher types of mammals afford excellent material for comparison. Minkowski's experimental study of the dog indicates that the clinical, anatomical visual sphere is covered with the cytoarchitectonic sphere; for lasting visual trouble can be caused only by extirpation of the area striata. The subcortical visual center in mammals undergoes secondary degeneration through destruction of the area striata, and therefore depends on the cortex. Also certain parts of the corpus geniculatum externum have an exact projection over certain areas of the cortex...|$|R
