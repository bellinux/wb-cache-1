Although Raj and Simran want to be together regardless of her father's plans for her, Raj tries to win over his girlfriend's father rather than simply eloping with her. In this and other Indian stories, family values are ultimately considered {{more important than the}} romantic plot. Moral values and rules of <b>conduct</b> <b>take</b> precedence over individual desires. The film implies that [...] "Indianness" [...] can be defined by the importance of family life; whether at home or abroad, it is the Indian family system that is recognised as the social institution that most defines Indian identity.|$|E

Tracing the historical and philosophical roots of modern war from the 17 th Century through to the present day, this book reveals that far from paralyzing the project of re-problematisating war, the emergence of NCW affords {{us an opportunity to}} rethink war in new and philosophically challenging ways...|$|E

40|$|The {{study is}} aiming to {{identify}} the problematical areas in municipal representatives' decision-making together with the identification of their conflict of interests. Ethics, legislation and public control (or municipal community in broader terms) are defined as constituents of municipal representatives' conduct. Municipal representatives as actors of decision-making process follow different values and interests, their ethical competences might vary, and other group interests and their moral obligations influence them too. Their behavior and <b>conduct</b> <b>take</b> place within conflict of these values, interests and obligations. The current legislation, nor other institutional arrangements reflect ethical standards and do not protect the public interest sufficiently. The public control fails too; the right {{to participate in the}} public life is not understood as a civic duty. The seriousness of the situation is exemplified in the analysis of Czech municipal representatives' delicts referring to their public duties. In majority of cases, the failure of morals applies supported by nepotism and clientelism that limit public control. It can be stated that the municipality size structure affects the public control; a smaller municipality shows lower citizens' effectiveness.
