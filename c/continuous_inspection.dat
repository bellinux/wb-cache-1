5000|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>{{inspection}}</b> (carcass-by-carcass inspection) is the USDA’s {{meat and}} poultry inspection system, called [...] "continuous" [...] because no animal destined for human food may be slaughtered or dressed unless an inspector is continuously present. The inspector examines each animal before slaughter (antemortem inspection) and the carcass and parts after slaughter (postmortem inspection).

In 1967, the Wholesome Meat Act amended the FMIA, and in 1968, the Wholesome Poultry Act amended the PPIA, both requiring states to conduct inspection programs at least as stringent as federal inspections. The Egg Products Inspection Act (EPIA), passed in 1970, ensured the <b>continuous</b> <b>inspection</b> of the processing of egg products.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{analytical}} {{model of a}} rigid rotor supported by hydrodynamic journal bearings where the plane separation technique together with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to predict the location and magnitude of the correction masses for balancing the rotor bearing system. The rotating system is modeled by applying the rigid shaft Stodola-Green model, in which the shaft gyroscopic moments and rotatory inertia are accounted for, {{in conjunction with the}} hydrodynamic cylindrical journal bearing model based on the classical Reynolds equation. A linearized perturbation procedure is employed to render the lubrication equations from the Reynolds equation, which allows predicting the eight linear force coefficients associated with the bearing direct and cross-coupled stiffness and damping coefficients. The results show that the methodology presented is efficient for balancing rotor systems. This paper gives a step further in the monitoring process, since Artificial Neural Network is normally used to predict, not to correct the mass unbalance. The procedure presented can be used in turbo machinery industry to balance rotating machinery that require <b>continuous</b> <b>inspections.</b> Some simulated results will be used in order to clarify the methodology presented.

40|$|With {{pipelines}} growing older, {{more and}} more inspection data of different origin are gathered. Most of the data is acquired by In-Line inspection tools as they can cover the whole length of a pipeline in one inspection job. The comparison {{of the results of}} in-line inspections becomes {{more and more}} important. Not only should the previous results be verified, but the continuous monitoring of the pipeline's condition allows to derive new conclusions like the assessment of corrosion growth. The paper will discuss how defect growth can be estimated from <b>continuous</b> <b>inspections</b> and what implications the advancement in inspection technology has. Several models of corrosion growth assessment are discussed. Their applicability depends on the condition of the pipeline, i. e. the density of defects and the available data. A stepwise process can be defined in which more detailed information will allow to use more accurate methods of corrosion growth assessment. In a final stage the data of high-resolution ultrasonic inspection tools can be used to compare defects on a basis of wall thickness C-Scans. This will generate more precise conclusions about corrosion growth on single defects, which was not possible on the traditional statistical approach...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{attribute}} {{control charts}} {{are based on}} the monitoring of the number of nonconforming items in a sample of fixed size. In modern manufacturing processes, since items can be checked automatically, use of samples of a fixed subjective size with traditional charts is not suitable for on‐line <b>continuous</b> <b>inspection.</b> Furthermore, the sample size usually has to be large when the process fraction nonconforming is not reasonably high. If a decision is to be made only when a sufficient number of items are manufactured and inspected, many nonconforming items might have been produced. In this paper, a control scheme is presented based on the monitoring of cumulative counts of items inspected. This procedure will limit the number of consecutive nonconforming items to a small value when the process has suddenly deteriorated, can detect a sudden process shift quickly and is suitable for <b>continuous</b> <b>inspection</b> processes.

30|$|Empirical {{evidence}} for the latter approach arises from Wirzberger et al. (2017), who applied a basal learning task that a priori varied the amount of interacting information elements (ICL) and induced interruptions at several points over the task (ECL). Statistical analyses compared linear, quadratic, and logarithmic progression models, and the results suggested a logarithmic progression of schema-related cognitive load (GCL) over time, influenced by structural features. The resulting inversion of the learning curve (Ebbinghaus, 1964) aligns well with established evidence on cognitive skill acquisition (Anderson, 1983; Kraiger, Ford, & Salas, 1993; Shiffrin & Schneider, 1977). It also provides further evidence that building and organizing schematic structures of knowledge in the initial process stages shed higher demands on cognitive resources, whereas automation and tuning procedures in later process stages require smaller resource supplies. Although the approach already yielded promising results, the study raised {{the need for a}} more <b>continuous</b> controlled <b>inspection</b> of the determined mechanisms.|$|R
40|$|Inspection {{involves}} examining deteriorating {{systems to}} try to identify their state, in order to effect some repair, replacement, or maintenance action. In many cases, one is able to monitor the system {{at no extra cost}} and with no interference to the system, and so one has a <b>continuous</b> costless <b>inspection</b> process. In other cases, such as health care, inspection involves stopping the normal running of the system to carry out some costly procedures. Another division is between inspections that are able to give a perfect diagnosis {{of the state of the}} system and those that give only partial information on the system. This paper derives the properties for a number of related inspection models, not discussed elsewhere in the literature, varying only in the quality and cost of inspection. It then points out how existing models in the literature could be classified similarly by emphasizing the inspection costs and whether the inspection is perfect or not. 1...|$|R

An approach to mitigate the decreasing quality of a project is to track metrics and certain properties of the project, in order to view the progression of the project’s properties. This approach may be carried out by introducing continuous code inspection with the application of static code analysis. However, as the initial common opinion is that these type of tools produce a too high number of false positives, {{there is a need to}} investigate what the actual case is. This is the origin for the investigation and case study performed in this paper. The case study is performed at Ida Infront AB in Linköping, Sweden and involves interviews with developers to determine the performance of the <b>continuous</b> <b>inspection</b> platform SonarQube, in addition to examine the general opinion among developers at the company. The author executes the implementation and configuration of a <b>continuous</b> <b>inspection</b> environment to analyze a partition of the company’s product and determine what rules that are appropriate to apply in the company’s context. The results from the investigation indicate the high quality and accuracy of the tool, in addition to the advantageous functionality of continuously monitoring the code to observe trends and the progression of metrics such as cyclomatic complexity and duplicated code, with the goal of preventing the constant increase of complex and duplicated code. Combining this with features such as false positive suppression, instant analysis feedback in pull requests and the possibility to break the build given specified conditions, suggests that the implemented environment is a way to mitigate software quality difficulties. 建立和保持高水平的软件质量可以带来经济利益等诸多好处，然而这是一项很困难的任务。其中一种防止软件项目质量下降的方法是通过跟踪项目的度量值和某些属性，来查看项目的属性的变化情况。通过引入持续的代码审查和应用静态代码分析方法可以实现这种方法。然而，在人们的印象中，这类工具往往具有较高的误检，因此需要进一步调查实际情况、研究其可行性，这是本文的初始研究目标。本文在瑞典林雪平的Ida Infront AB公司开展了案例研究，调研了该公司开发人员的意见，并通过访问开发人员，确定持续的代码审查平台SonarQube的性能。作者对持续的代码审查环境进行了配置，分析了公司的部分产品，进而确定哪些规则适用于该公司。调查结果表明该工具是高质量并且准确的，还提供了持续监测代码来观察度量值的趋势和进展等先进功能，例如通过监测环路复杂度和重复代码等度量值，来防止复杂度和重复代码的增加。通过组合误检压缩、对pull requests的瞬间分析反馈、以及分解和建立给定的条件等特征，使得所实现的环境成为一种可以降低软件质量保障难度的方式...|$|E

40|$|The {{essence of}} {{structural}} health monitoring (SHM) {{is to develop}} systems based on nondestructive inspection (NDI) technologies for <b>continuous</b> monitoring, <b>inspection</b> and detection of structural damages. A new architecture of a remote SHM system based on Electromechanical Impedance (EMI) measures is {{described in the present}} contribution. The proposed environment is employed to automatically monitor the structural integrity of aircrafts and is composed by sensor networks, a signal conditioning system, a data acquisition hardware and a data processing system.

This approach increases the operational capacity of the structure without compromising the security of the flights. As the environment continually checks for the first signs of damage, possibly reducing or eliminating scheduled aircraft inspections, it could significantly decrease maintenance and repair expenses. Furthermore, the usage of this system allows the creation of a historical database of the aircrafts structural integrity, making possible the incremental development of a Damage Prognosis System (DPS).
