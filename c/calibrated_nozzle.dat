40|$|Test {{techniques}} {{are being developed}} to use the Compact Multimission Aircraft Propulsion Simulator (CMAPS) in wind-tunnel tests. The CMAPS allows simultaneous simulation of inlet and exhaust flow fields. Static tests have been conducted to acquire CMAPS performance data and to evaluate four methods of determining compressor inlet airflow during wind-tunnel tests. The first method measures airflow at the compressor face; the second measures airflow in the compressor discharge duct; the third deduces the compressor airflow from the <b>calibrated</b> <b>nozzle,</b> turbine supply, and turbine bleed airflows; and the fourth correlates compressor airflow with the mixer pressure. Test results and the advantages, disadvantages, and expected accuracy of each method are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A Three {{dimensional}} measurement {{is presented}} {{of both the}} in-plane and out-of-plane components of the flow field velocity of 0. 5 mu m styrene particles at 30 ms(- 1) in air from a <b>calibrated</b> <b>nozzle</b> by using a co-linear side scattering PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) approach. The light sheet used to illuminate the particles was generated using a Nd-YAG laser (200 mJ), operating in triple pulse mode. The scattered light from the particle was imaged through a near diffraction limited lens. The particle images have been analysed from both their respective diffraction patterns and from their out of focus intensity profile. The authors show that the co-linear 3 D PIV method {{can be used to}} determine the particle velocity in three directions. Results have been presented for different flow angles through a calibration 30 ms(- 1) air jet, showing {{that it is possible to}} identify the particle position in three directions, within a turbulent flow, to a spatial accuracy of +/- 20 mu m...|$|E
40|$|NASA s model-scale nozzle noise {{tests show}} that it is {{possible}} to achieve a 3 EPNdB jet noise reduction with inwardfacing chevrons and flipper-tabs installed on the primary nozzle and fan nozzle chevrons. These chevrons and tabs are simple devices and are easy to be incorporated into existing short duct separate-flow nonmixed nozzle exhaust systems. However, these devices are expected to cause some small amount of thrust loss relative to the axisymmetric baseline nozzle system. Thus, it is important to have these devices further tested in a <b>calibrated</b> <b>nozzle</b> performance test facility to quantify the thrust performances of these devices. The choice of chevrons or tabs for jet noise suppression would most likely be based on the results of thrust loss performance tests to be conducted by Aero System Engineering (ASE) Inc. It is anticipated that the most promising concepts identified from this program will be validated in full scale engine tests at both Pratt & Whitney and Allied-Signal, under funding from NASA s Engine Validation of Noise Reduction Concepts (EVNRC) programs. This will bring the technology readiness level to the point where the jet noise suppression concepts could be incorporated with high confidence into either new or existing turbofan engines having short-duct, separate-flow nacelles...|$|E
40|$|Results {{obtained}} in <b>calibrating</b> the <b>nozzle</b> exit {{flow of the}} HEG facility at four conditions are discussed. A rake {{was used to measure}} Pitot pressure profiles at two axial locations in the test section. For a finer resolution of the boundary layer, a smaller rake was positioned at the nozzle exit. The experimental data are compared with results obtained from nozzle flow calculations using an upwind TVD Thin-Layer Navier-Stokes code, which takes into account thermal and chemical nonequilibrium...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{optimization}} of the machining assisted by cryogenic cooling. The main objective is to analyze {{the effect of the}} pressure and the flow of liquid nitrogen on tool life when machining titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V using the cryogenic assisted machining. A nozzle holder has been specially developed for this study to ensure positioning and the replacement of <b>calibrated</b> <b>nozzles</b> of different diameters. Several nozzle diameters have been therefore used in order to vary the pressure and the flow according to tests to be conducted. The flow rate has been varied between 1. 2 l/min and 3. 4 l/min for two pressure ranges 8 - 10 bar and 4 - 5 bar respectively. The machining tests have allowed to highlight the effect of the pressure and flow rate of liquid nitrogen jet on the tool life. Indeed, the results showed that increasing the flow rate increases the tool life. In addition, the increase in pressureslowed down the evolution of the wear and further improves the tool life. Indeed, in all tested cases, the cryogenic assistance improves the tool life but the best results have been obtained for the highest pressure and flow rate. Moreover, surface integrity has been greatly improve...|$|R
40|$|Rotary piston {{flowmeters}} (RPF) {{are widely}} used for accurate measurement of gas flow rates. We used it to calibrate a Koennecke-type quadrant nozzle flowmeter. The evaluated discharge coefficient exhibited strange local maxima, even exceeding unity. The phenomenon was sensitive {{to the length of}} the tubes connecting the RPF with the <b>calibrated</b> quadrant <b>nozzle.</b> One possible explanation, discussed in the present paper, is the local maxima to be due to acoustic resonance in the system, excited by periodic character of the flow through the RPF. Another possibility is that the also the inertia of the pistons plays a role, the air providing the spring action...|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} in November 2013 to assess the drift reduction potential of a three headed spray-hood unit with either DG 95 - 02 or DG 95 - 015 low-drift nozzles used with the hoods either on or off (DG <b>nozzles</b> <b>calibrated</b> at 0. 6 litres/min). A standard treatment of 110 - 03 <b>nozzles</b> <b>calibrated</b> at 1. 25 litres/min without hoods was the control. One tank mix of 0. 4 g/litre PTSA (1, 3, 6, 8 -pyrenetetrasulfonic acid tetrasodium salt) fluorescent dye was used for all treatments. Petri dishes and aluminium plate collectors were placed at 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 m downwind in three lines spaced at 10 m. Collectors were placed in plastic bags under cool, dark storage until analysis. Results showed that total drift was reduced up to 99 %, compared to the control, when the spray hoods where used...|$|R
40|$|A {{description}} is given of {{a method for}} <b>calibrating</b> flow <b>nozzles</b> used in compressor testing which is insensitive to flow variations during a survey. A computer program to reduce hand-recorded data from manometers is described which uses a compressible flow expression whose derivation {{is included in the}} first appendix. This appendix gives forms of the statement of continuity along a streamline when "limiting" values of the density and velocity are used to non-dimensionalize these parameters. This technique has been found to simplify the writing of computer programs for analyzing measurements from turbomachines, and to generally simplify analyses of flows that can be taken to be adiabatic. The method used to integrate experimental data taken over arbitrary intervals, which is of general use is described and a listing of the subroutine is given in a second appendix.

40|$|FTER rain showers, wind erodible-size {{particles}} on A {{the surface}} dry rapidly and often begin abrading the surface aggregates and crust {{while the latter}} are still moist. The objectives of this investigation were to measure the abrasive loss rates of moist aggregates and develop prediction equations of the loss rates that would be useful in field studies as we 11 as in development of complex wind erosion models. Accordingly, soil samples were obtained from four soils ranging from a sandy loam to a silty clay loam. Forty aggregates, 4, to 6 cm in diameter, were selected from each soil and then further subdivided by establishing four moisture levels with 10 aggregates at each level. Each aggregate was abraded in an enclosed chamber using a <b>calibrated</b> sandblasting <b>nozzle.</b> A stability test was also conducted on air-dried subsamples of each soil. In this test, 1. 3 to 1. 9 cm diameter aggregates were crushed to a fixed end point and the work done per unit mass (J/Kg) was measured. Test {{results showed that the}} slope of a regression line for the abrasion loss rate versus normalized moisture content varied in a systematic manner, as dry aggregate stability ranged from low to high. Thus, it was possible to develop a simple estimating equation to predict abrasion loss rate as a function of average dry aggregate crushing energy and aggregate moisture content...|$|R
40|$|Cooperative Forestry and Pest Management {{conducted}} a pilot control project in central Montana {{to determine the}} effectiveness of two commercial formulations of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner applied at 8 billion international units (BIU) per acre (19. 8 BIU per hectare) when used under operational conditions against the western spruce budworm, Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman. Nine blocks 2, 000 - 4, 200 acres (810 - 1, 701 hectares) were selected in areas of budworm infestation on State, private, BLM, and Forest Service lands near Butte, Montana. Three blocks were randomly assigned Dipel 4 L treatment, three blocks were assigned Thuricide 16 B treatment, and the remaining three served as control blocks. Time and sequence of treatment was determined by larval development sampling in each block. Blocks were released for treatment when 50 percent of the larvae had developed to or beyond the fourth instar. A prespray population sample was collected within 24 hours of spraying from 25 three-tree cluster plots established in each block. Treating began on June 29 and ended on July 5. Spray was applied with two Ayers Turbo Thrush aircraft equipped with fulljet one-eighth 66 A 8 W <b>nozzles</b> <b>calibrated</b> at 1 gallon per acre (1. 5 liters per hectare). Dipel was applied to 8, 600 acres (3, 493 hectares), and Thuricide to 8, 150 acres (3, 301 hectares). Eight thousand acres (3, 240 hectares) were used as control areas. Postspray population samples were collected at 7, 14, and 21 days following treatment. Population densities are expressed in number of larvae per 100 shoots. Following egg deposition, percent defoliation and egg mass densities were collected from each cluster tree. Unadjusted budworm mortality at 21 days was 48 and 62 percent for Dipel and Thuricide respectively. Budworm mortality in control blocks averaged 26 percent. Percent defoliation was 33, 36, and 47 for Dipel, Thuricide, and control. Adjusted mortality for all larvae (combined) prior to the egg stage was 73 and 91 percent for Dipel and Thuricide. In 1981, percent parasitism for all defoliators in the Dipel, Thuricide, and control blocks was 21. 5, 19. 8, and 26. 0, respectively. Egg mass densities per square meter (per square foot) in 1981 were 18. 3 (5. 6), 17. 6 (5. 4), and 38. 5 (11. 7) for Dipel, Thuricide, and control. Mean budworm larvael densities in 1982 were 4. 4, 3. 5, and 12. 7 larvae per 100 shoots for the Dipel, Thuricide, and control areas. Rearing samples showed {{a greater proportion of}} females emerging in sprayed than in control blocks (61. 4 and 62. 0 percent for Dipel and Thuricide compared to 52. 4 percent in the controls); however, adult female weight was higher in the control blocks (126. 3 mg compared to 121. 3 and 113. 9 mg for the Dipel and Thuricide blocks, respectively). Average percent parasitism of budworm larvae and pupae in 1982 was 5. 1, 8. 6, and 7. 3 for the Dipel, Thuricide, and control blocks. We were unable to distinguish any effects of B. t. on individual budworm parasite species during the study. Egg mass densities in 1982 were 44. 5 (13. 6), 39. 7 (12. 1), and 78. 6 (24. 0) per square meter (per square foot) for Dipel, Thuricide, and control...|$|R
