40|$|We outline constructions {{for both}} {{pseudo-random}} generators and one-way hash functions. These <b>constructions</b> <b>are</b> {{based on the}} exact TSP (XTSP), a special variant of the well known traveling salesperson problem. We prove that these <b>constructions</b> <b>are</b> secure if the XTSP <b>is</b> infeasible. Our <b>constructions</b> <b>are</b> easy to implement, appear to be fast, but require {{a large amount of}} memory...|$|R
50|$|On 18 March 2002 tower <b>construction</b> <b>was</b> {{started with}} the {{excavation}} of the tower foundations; on 3 June 2002 building of the tower structure began. For this the lower elements of the framework <b>construction</b> <b>were</b> pre-assembled in pairs and then put in place. The missing diagonal elements were then added afterwards. On 21 June 2002 the <b>construction</b> <b>was</b> finished.|$|R
5|$|As of 2015, <b>construction</b> <b>is</b> {{underway}} on {{the widening}} {{and expansion of}} E.C. Row's eastern extension, County Road 22. Under the new plans, the highway is being widened to four lanes from Banwell Road to Old Tecumseh Road (County Road2) in Puce.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{studies on the}} project and previous bond bills, there is currently no identified funding source; due to the MBTA's constrained finances, <b>construction</b> <b>is</b> not likely to begin soon. The 1992-built Lynn parking garage, designed for the capacity needed for the Blue Line extension, does not fill fully from commuter rail ridership.|$|E
40|$|The {{paradigm}} of skew-tolerant parallel asynchronous communication {{was introduced by}} Blaum and Bruck (see ibid., vol. 39, 1993) along with constructions for codes that can tolerate or detect skew.

5|$|The {{step from}} rationals to reals {{is a major}} extension. There {{are at least two}} popular ways to achieve this step, both {{published}} in 1872: Dedekind cuts and Cauchy sequences. Proofs that 0.999... = 1 which directly use these constructions are not found in textbooks on real analysis, where the modern trend for the last few decades has been to use an axiomatic analysis. Even when a <b>construction</b> <b>is</b> offered, it is usually applied towards proving the axioms of the real numbers, which then support the above proofs. However, several authors express the idea that starting with a <b>construction</b> <b>is</b> more logically appropriate, and the resulting proofs are more self-contained.|$|E
50|$|<b>Construction</b> <b>was</b> {{started in}} 1499 by the Danish knight Jens Holgersen Ulfstand and stone-cutter-mason and {{architect}} Adam van Düren, a North German master who also worked on Lund Cathedral. <b>Construction</b> <b>was</b> completed in 1506.|$|R

Improved pedestrian routes will take people into the town centre. <b>Construction</b> <b>is</b> expected to take two years and the interchange should be open by the end of 2018.|$|E
5|$|Bada Gumbad was {{constructed}} in 1490 CE, and {{is believed to have}} the earliest constructed full dome of any building in Delhi. Its <b>construction</b> <b>is</b> generally attributed to Sikandar Lodhi. A mihrab (prayer niche) in the Friday mosque (Jama Masjid) of the Bara Gumbad gives the date of construction as 900 AH (Anno Hegirae) of the Islamic lunar calendar.|$|E
5|$|By 1508, {{construction}} work was completed {{at the north}} of the Loggia, which contained the staircase to access the upper level of the public building. The <b>construction</b> <b>is</b> designed as a body in itself, separated from the main building by a path and connected to it by a covered overpass, a configuration that has come down to us intact. The contribution of Cairano, who at that point returned to the Loggia after at least five years of a stellar career elsewhere, is the portal to the ground floor of the annex and in some ornamentation on the overpass.|$|E
5000|$|Progressive constructions denote ongoing {{activity}} {{at a specific}} point of time or continuous activity over an extent of time.

5|$|Coursed mud <b>construction</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the oldest}} {{approaches}} to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of a wall, and allowed to dry. More mud is added and allowed to dry to form successive courses until the wall is complete. With puddled mud, a hand-made mud form is filled with wetter mud and allowed to dry.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{structure}} materials may be {{as simple}} as mud, or mud mixed with straw to make cob. Sturdy dwellings may be also built from sod or turf. Soil may be stabilized by the addition of lime or cement, and may be compacted into rammed earth. <b>Construction</b> <b>is</b> faster with pre-formed adobe or mudbricks, compressed earth blocks, earthbags or fired clay bricks.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, it was {{announced}} SITA had plans to build another EfW plant adjacent to the current one, named the North East Energy Recovery Centre (NEERC). SITA UK began consulting key partners, stakeholders and local residents on these plans in April 2008, before submitting a formal planning application that summer. Permission for the plant's construction was granted on 15 October 2008. On 17 September 2010, it {{was announced}} that SITA had signed a contract with the South Tyne and Wear Waste Management Partnership for their waste to be burned at NEERC once the plant was completed. <b>Construction</b> <b>is</b> expected to begin in early 2011, in time for a 2013 completion date.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, the MTA filed {{to change}} the {{location}} of Entrance 1, moving it onto from the sidewalk, away from its original proposed location inside 301 East 69th Street. This was because designs for entrances inside the building failed to both satisfy the building's residents as well as meet the MTA's engineering requirements. With the New York City Department of Transportation planning a bike lane along {{the east side of}} Second Avenue after <b>construction</b> <b>is</b> finished, the MTA could widen the sidewalk {{to make room for the}} entrances without ultimately disrupting traffic flow.|$|E
5|$|Khaba is {{commonly}} {{thought to have}} built the Layer Pyramid, located at Zawyet el'Aryan, about 8km south-west of Giza. The pyramid's <b>construction</b> <b>is</b> typical of Third Dynasty masonry with mudbricks arranged in layers around a core made of rough blocks from the local bedrock. The pyramid was planned to be about 42 to 45 meters tall, but is now only 17 meters. It is unclear whether part of the pyramid has been eroded over time or its construction was never finished. While there are no inscriptions directly relating the pyramid to Khaba, his serekh appears on stone bowls that were discovered in a nearby mastaba, known as Mastaba Z500.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{military}} structures that {{were built in the}} late 19th century in Šiaurės miestelis have been preserved and restored. Meanwhile, much of the construction that was not deemed to be of permanent value, erected during the Soviet times, has been demolished, leaving room for new streets and housing. The combination of military heritage sites and newer <b>construction</b> <b>is</b> a distinctive feature of Šiaurės miestelis.|$|E
