2500|$|While when a {{contract}} is silent a court must essentially {{make an informed}} choice about whether a right to terminate should exist, if {{a contract}} deals with the matter the courts' general approach is to follow the parties' wishes. The drafters of the old Sale of Goods Act 1893 distinguished between [...] "conditions" [...] (major terms, which when breached confer a right to terminate) and [...] "warranties" [...] (minor terms, which do not), and under the present Sale of Goods Act 1979 some terms, such as descriptions about quality, are conditions by default. A third kind is an [...] "innominate term", which is typically a vague term like <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> pellets being [...] "in good condition", or a ship having to be [...] "seaworthy". Because such a term could be breached in both a major way (e.g. the ship sinks) or a trivial way (e.g. a lifejacket is missing) the court will determine whether the right to terminate arises based on how serious in fact {{the consequences of the}} breach were. So in The Hong Kong Fir, Lord Diplock held that a ship crew being too incompetent to properly operate the vessel did not breach the contract's [...] "seaworthiness" [...] term in a serious enough way as to allow for termination, because the charterers still got a working boat and could have replaced the crew. If a contract specifies that a particular obligation is a [...] "condition" [...] the dominant approach of the courts is to treat it as such. Nevertheless, concerned with the ability of a stronger party to specify the terms it finds most convenient as [...] "conditions" [...] {{at the expense of the}} weaker, courts retain the ability to construe an agreement contra proferentum. In L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd the majority of the House of Lords held that clause 7 of a contract, stating it was [...] "a condition of this agreement" [...] that Mr Wickman would visit 6 major car companies [...] "at least once in every week" [...] to try selling panel presses, was not really a condition in the technical sense. So when Mr Wickman was found to have visited much less, Schuler AG could not dismiss him. This was because clause 11 said that 60 days of warning was needed before Schuler AG could terminate, so the whole contract read together meant the clause 7 had to be subject to clause 11. The language in the contract is not decisive. If the word [...] "condition" [...] is not used, but the contract describes a right to terminate, such as the contract being terminable for [...] "any breach" [...] of obligation, the issue is, again, one of construction and the courts may be reluctant to give effect to the plain meaning if it would have [...] "draconian consequences" [...] for the weaker party. By contrast, in Bunge Corporation v Tradax SA the House of Lords held that giving notice for a ship to start loading the soya bean cargo four days late, when the contract expressly stipulated the date, should allow the right to terminate regardless of the actual consequences of the breach. In mercantile contracts, 'broadly speaking time will be considered of the essence', and so it is highly likely the courts will enforce obligations to the letter.|$|E

The supplements compared were no supplement, <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> alone, <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> with urea, and <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> with added UIP. Supplemented cattle produced greater gains than unsupplemented cattle. <b>Citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> with added UIP produced the greatest ADG (0. 95 lb/hd/d) whereas <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> with added urea produced the lowest ADG (0. 53 lb/hd/d). An economic {{evaluation of the}} costs associated with preconditioning using <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> based supplements was conducted. <b>Citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> with added UIP was the most economical and <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> with added urea was the least economical, of the supplements fed. Although BW gains were low to moderate and profit was minimal, <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> shows potential as a supplement for preconditioning calves in Florida. Increased performance of preconditioned calves in the feedlot has led to premiums offered for preconditioned calves.

40|$|International audienceThe pulp {{extracts}} of twenty-one {{varieties of}} citrus fruits (oranges, satsumah, clementine, mandarins, tangor, bergamot, lemon, tangelos, kumquat, calamondin and pamplemousses), commonly grown in Mauritius, were characterised {{in terms of}} their total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), polyphenol composition and vitamin C contents. Total phenolics ranged from 406. 3 ± 14 to 1694 ± 19 μg g− 1 fresh weight (FW). Total flavonoids varied between 133 ± 6 and 965 ± 7 μg g− 1 FW and vitamin C contents were from 166 ± 19 μg/mL to 677 ± 22 μg/mL. The pulp of a pamplemousse variety had the highest TSS/TA ratio whereas lemon pulps had lowest TSS/TA ratios. The antioxidant activities of the pulp extracts were assessed and total phenolics correlated strongly with the trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), ferric reducing antioxidant capacity (FRAP) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) scavenging activity assays. Based on their antioxidant activities, nine citrus fruits namely, one orange, tangor, kumquat, calamondin and pamplemousse variety and two mandarin and tangelo varieties were further characterised for their flavanone, flavonol and flavone levels by HPLC. Hesperidin (6. 89 ± 0. 06 to 26. 98 ± 0. 07 mg/g FW) and narirutin (0. 27 ± 0. 01 and 20. 91 ± 0. 10 mg/g FW) were present at high concentrations compared to the other flavonoid glycosides in the pulp extracts.

The crude fibre fractions were 15. 04 % cellulose, 20. 46 % hemi-cellulose, 38. 28 % NDF, 18. 32 % ADF and 3. 28 % ADL. The experimental rabbits {{were randomly assigned to}} six dietary treatments: T 0, T 5, T 10, T 15, T 20 and T 25 in which SOPM replaced maize at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 %, respectively at the rate of six rabbits per dietary group. The rabbits were fed these diets for 84 days during which performance and nutrient digestibility were evaluated. Experimental diets had significant effects (p< 0. 05) on the body weight gain, water intake, water: feed ratio, protein efficiency ratio and final live weight. Coefficient of digestibility and nutrient digestibility, were not adversely affected by the inclusion of SOPM in the diets. This study has shown the possibility that sweet orange fruit pulp meal {{can be used as a}} replacement feedstuff for maize in the ration of grower rabbit up to a level of 20 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} soil {{rare earth element}} (REE) on navel orange quality and safety in rare earth ore areas have gained great attention. This study {{investigated}} the transfer characteristics of REE from soil to navel orange <b>pulp</b> (<b>Citrus</b> sinensis Osbeck cv. Newhall) and {{examined the effects of}} soil REE on internal fruit quality in Xinfeng County, Jiangxi province, China. Path analysis showed that soil REE, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and Fe oxide (Feox) significantly affected pulp REE concentrations. A Freundlich-type prediction model for pulp REE was established: log[REEpulp] = - 1. 036 + 0. 272 log[REEsoil] - 0. 056 pH - 0. 360 log[CEC] + 0. 370 log[Feox] (n = 114, R 2 = 0. 60). From the prediction model, it was inferred that even when soil REE and Feox were as high as 1038 mg kg- 1 and 96. 4 g kg- 1, respectively, and pH and CEC were as low as 3. 75 and 5. 08 cmol kg- 1, respectively, pulp REE concentrations were much lower than the food limit standard. Additionally, soil REE levels were significantly correlated with selected fruit quality indicators, including titratable acidity (r = 0. 52, P < 0. 01), total soluble solids (r = 0. 48, P < 0. 01) and vitamin C (r = 0. 56, P < 0. 01). Generally, under routine methods of water and fertilization management, the cultivation of navel oranges in rare earth ore areas of south China with soil REE ranging from 38. 6 to 546 mg kg- 1 had improved in internal fruit quality...|$|R

40|$|The wild Citrus is {{hitherto}} very imperfectly {{known from}} the Japanese territories, though this region is generally believed {{to be one of}} the native homes of this important genus of Rutaceae. The author has repeatedly reported that Citrus taci bana TANAKA is native to Japan proper, covering the southern coasts of provinces Kii, Tosa, Hyuga, Osumi and Satsuma. Recently, its southern limit of occurence was found in the island of Sanbok (Amami Oshima), where the second wild species begins to appear. It was lately discovered that the same species (possible a veriety) occurs wild in Nagato province and in Querpert Island (Saishuto). In the main i s land of Luchu (Okinawa), a very remarkable wild species is known under the name of Suikwasha, and through the closer examination of Formosan Citrus, this was identified by the author to be Citrus depressa HAVATA, first described from Gaogan, Taihoku province. This second wild species was later found to distribute all over the Luchu Archipelago south of Sanbok. Noticeably, this species is connected ethnologically with the inhabitants of the island, just as the first species does with the forefathers of Japan proper. In Taiwan, Citrus tankan HAVATA is found in the myths of aborigines, and it does occur in the woods where they make use of it. It is not found in South China in any degree of primitive state, but is rather extensively cultivated for shipping purpose. There is another distinct species growing wild in the forests of Gaogan and Nansho (Shinchiku province), which is here described as a new species, Citrus taiwanica TANAKA & SHIMADA n. sp. This species is nearest to the sour orange, but is very distinct with its remarkably long leaves, medium-sized flat fruits with finely dotted leathery skin, and very acid deep-yellow <b>pulp.</b> <b>Citrus</b> gaoganensis HAYATA, reported wild from Gaogan, is n othing but an albino citron escaped from cultivation, and may preferably be called Citrus,medica gaoganensis n. comb. 1. 日本領土の第一野生柑橘はタチバナ Citrus tachibana TANAKA in Bul.

The mixtures were ensiled for 60 days at room temperature in polythene bags. Ensiling (time effect) resulted in an increase (P 0. 05) in dry matter intake between diets containing 0, 76 and 167 g/kg <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> when the intake was expressed {{on the basis of}} metabolic body weight. However, there was a decrease (P< 0. 001) in intake of silage and diet dry matter, organic matter and digestible organic matter when the level of <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> in the basal silage diet increased from 167 to 272 g/kg. Only animals on the basal silage diet containing 167 g/kg <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> had a higher (P< 0. 05) and positive nitrogen balance of 1. 0 g/day. It is concluded that wheat straw and poultry litter can be ensiled successfully with <b>citrus</b> <b>pulp</b> to produce silage that is safe and of high fermentation quality.
