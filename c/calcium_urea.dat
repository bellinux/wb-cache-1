40|$|Although {{multiple}} toxins {{have been}} implicated {{in the development of}} uraemic neuropathy, no causative agent has been identified. In the present study, the excitability properties of lower limb motor nerves in patients with end-stage kidney disease treated with haemodialysis were measured before, during and after a standard 5 h haemodialysis session, in an attempt to explore the pathophysiology of uraemic neuropathy. Compound muscle action potentials were recorded from tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum brevis, following stimulation of the common peroneal nerve in 14 patients. Measures of excitability were assessed in relation to changes in serum levels of potential neurotoxins, including potassium, <b>calcium,</b> <b>urea,</b> uric acid, parathyroid hormone and b- 2 -microglobulin. Before dialysis, measures of nerve excitability were significantly abnormal in the patient group for axons innervating tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum brevis, consistent with axonal depolarization: refractoriness was increased and superexcitability and depolarizing threshold electrotonus were reduced. Pre-dialysis excitability abnormalities were strongly correlated with serum K+. Correlation was also noted between the severity of symptoms and excitability abnormalities. Haemodialysis normalized the majority of nerve excitability parameters. In conclusion, lower limb motor axons in uraemic patients are depolarized before dialysis. The correlation between serum K+ and excitability measures indicates that hyperkalaemia is primarily responsible for uraemic depolarization, and a likely contributing factor to th...|$|E

Methods: In a group of 85 patients with upper urinary calcium stones and 85 healthy people, variables such as age, height, weight, BMI, T-score and Z-score results of bone densitometry of lumbar vertebrae (L 2 -L 4) and femoral neck were recorded. The serum levels of uric acid, calcium, potassium, sodium, phosphor, alkaline phosphates and parathyroid hormone were also analyzed and recorded. Furthermore, all patients, 24 -hour urine was studied for levels of cr, oxalate, citrate, uric acid <b>calcium,</b> <b>urea</b> and the total volume. Results: Lumbar and femoral bone mineral density (BMD) was significantly lower in patients suffering from renal stone.

Sixty pure breeds plus a mixed breed control group were represented by at least 10 individuals. All analytes, except for sodium, chloride and glucose, showed variation with age. Total protein, globulin, potassium, chloride, creatinine, cholesterol, total bilirubin, ALT, CK, amylase, and lipase varied between sexes. Neutering status significantly impacted all analytes except albumin, sodium, <b>calcium,</b> <b>urea,</b> and glucose. Principal component analysis of serum biochemical data revealed 36 pure breeds with distinctive phenotypes. Furthermore, comparative analysis identified 23 breeds with significant differences from the mixed breed group in all biochemical analytes except urea and glucose. Eighteen breeds were identified by both principal component and comparative analysis. Tentative reference intervals were generated for breeds with a distinctive phenotype identified by comparative analysis and represented by at least 120 individuals. This is the first large-scale analysis of breed-specific serum biochemical phenotypes in the domestic dog and highlights potential genetic components of biochemical traits in this species...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the potential diuretic effect of two natural products, Elephantopus scaber and Alpinia speciosa, a trial administration {{was carried out in}} ten healthy volunteers and the effects compared to the those of a placebo. The substances were given on different days, with a seven day interval between doses. The amount of substance administered to the subjects was five times the usual dose i. e. 7. 5 g/ 100 ml and 0. 8 g/ 100 ml respectively. The following parameters parameteres were measured: urinary and plasma sodium, potassium, uric acid, <b>calcium,</b> phosphate, <b>urea,</b> creatinine. The subjects were also examined clinically and total urinary volume was assessed. The only significant finding (p < 0. 05) was a slight diuresis with Alpinia speciosa, which also lowered the diastolic (p < 0. 05) and systolic (p < 0. 01) blood pressures. No effect on electrolytes or renal function parameters was observed, and this probably excludes any renal tubular or glomerular effect from these substances.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the effects of using different levels of Guar meal on performance and blood metabolites in Holstein lactating cows. Sixteen lactating Holstein cows(DIM= 95 ± 10) were used in Latin square design with 4 block and 4 repeats. Animal in each group fed 1 of 4 experimental rations. Diets contain 0, 50, 75 and 100 percentage cottonseed meal were replaced with gaur meal. Diets were similar as NEL and crude protein (Iso caloric and iso nitrogenous) on dry basis. Cows were fed with total mixed ration individually. Dry matter intake and milk yields were higher for cows fed with 0 % guar meal and lowest for 100 cottonseed meal replaced by guar meal, but no significant difference were found among FCM 4 %. Milk fat and protein percentage and yields were highest for 50 % Guar meal, but no significant difference was found between milk lactose and <b>calcium.</b> Milk <b>Urea</b> Nitrogen and blood urea nitrogen were not significantly affected by experimental diets...|$|R
40|$|Knowing {{the values}} of the {{metabolic}} profile is important for prevention of so-called "production diseases" which have significant negative impact on the milk production. The aim of these investigations was determination of the metabolic profile and its referent values in the diary cows in several farms. Investigations included four categories of diary cows: pregnant heifers, cows in early lactation, cows in late lactation and dry cows. Discussion explains both significant differences of values of some parameters (glucosis, total proteins, urea, creatinine, AST, GGT) in different groups of animals which were investigated and significant correlations between some parameters (glucosis, total protein, albumin, <b>calcium,</b> phosphorus, <b>urea,</b> creatinine, cholesterol, triglycerids, AST, GGT) within each of groups of animals. The values gained with our investigations were compared with the referent values. It was found that cows included in our investigations were good metabolic profile, although their values were in some degree different from the referent values. Cows which were in lactation, especially the early lactation, had disposition of development of energy-protein deficit, but the disposition to calcium deficit was low...|$|R
