40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the tacit and <b>codified</b> knowledge in evolutionary economic models. In these models, knowledge is defined as different from information, and as dynamic, path dependent and embedded in human actions, in other words, in habits or skills, and routines. Such a definition of knowledge, in fact, gives clues about the characteristics, tacit or <b>codified,</b> of knowledge in evolutionary economic models. From this perspective, tacit knowledge resides at the core of routines, and it is needed to interpret even <b>codified</b> information or messages. However tacit and <b>codified</b> knowledge is interrelated, continuous and complementary, furthermore they can turn into each other over time. Hence, the evolutionary perspective denies the bi-polar distinction between tacit and <b>codified</b> knowledge, and emphasizes on their collective presence as embedded in routines.

In 1853, he represented Polk and Tillamook counties in the Territorial Legislature as a Democratic Party politician in the lower chamber House of Representatives. The following year, he was selected to help <b>codify</b> Oregon's laws, along with James K. Kelly and Daniel R. Bigelow. In 1857, Boise was a Democratic delegate to the Oregon Constitutional Convention from Polk County. While serving at the Constitutional Convention, Boise served on the Legislation Committee.|$|E

5|$|Muslim {{countries}} that retain or adopt Sharia usually determine which {{parts of the}} Sharia are enforceable and <b>codify</b> (and thereby modernize) them. Unlike other Muslim countries, Saudi Arabia regards uncodified Sharia in its entirety as {{the law of the}} land and does not interfere with it. It is, therefore, unique not only when compared to Western systems, but also in comparison to other Muslim countries, and according to one source is the closest system in the modern world to the form of Sharia adopted at the advent of Islam.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's set {{of civil}} laws, the Code Civil—now often {{known as the}} Napoleonic Code—was {{prepared}} by committees of legal experts {{under the supervision of}} Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès, the Second Consul. Napoleon participated actively in the sessions of the Council of State that revised the drafts. The development of the code was a fundamental change {{in the nature of the}} civil law legal system with its stress on clearly written and accessible law. Other codes ("Les cinq codes") were commissioned by Napoleon to <b>codify</b> criminal and commerce law; a Code of Criminal Instruction was published, which enacted rules of due process.|$|E
5|$|Such issues made {{attempts}} to <b>codify</b> the compositions {{in a uniform}} manner impossible. An example of this could be found among the Maguindanao where the word binalig is used by contemporary musicians as a name for one of the rhythmic modes associated with kangungudan but it has also been used as a term designating a “new” style. Another example concerns the discrepancy among “old” and “new” genres. With “new pieces” continuously proliferating even up till now, pieces only created decades ago are now considered “old” even though this is considered a tradition spanning many centuries. These differences could sometimes make discussing this repertoire and the modes and styles within it a bit confounding.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantines {{took care}} to <b>codify,</b> {{preserve}} and pass on the lessons of warfare at land and sea from past experience, {{through the use of}} military manuals. Despite their sometimes antiquarian terminology, these texts form the basis of our knowledge on Byzantine naval affairs. The main surviving texts are the chapters on sea combat (peri naumachias) in the Tactica of Leo the Wise and Nikephoros Ouranos (both drawing extensively from the Naumachiai of Syrianos Magistros and other earlier works), complemented by relevant passages in the De Administrando Imperio of Constantine Porphyrogennetos and other works by Byzantine and Arab writers.|$|E
5|$|By 1873, {{the college}} {{students}} playing football had made significant efforts to standardize their fledgling game. Teams had been scaled down from 25 players to 20. The {{only way to}} score was still to bat or kick the ball through the opposing team's goal, and the game was played in two 45 minute halves on fields 140 yards long and 70 yards wide. On October 20, 1873, representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City to <b>codify</b> {{the first set of}} intercollegiate football rules. Before this meeting, each school had its own set of rules and games were usually played using the home team's own particular code. At this meeting, a list of rules, based more on the Football Association's rules than the rules of the recently founded Rugby Football Union, was drawn up for intercollegiate football games.|$|E
5|$|From {{the reign}} of King James I, the {{beginnings}} of a legal profession began to develop and the administration of criminal and civil justice was centralised. The growing activity of the parliament and the centralisation of administration in Scotland called for the better dissemination of Acts of the parliament to the courts and other enforcers of the law. Throughout the late fifteenth century, unsuccessful attempts were made to form commissions of experts to <b>codify,</b> update or define Scots law. The legal uncertainty that this situation created prompted increased reliance on the common law found in Canon law, {{and there are a number}} of examples of statutes from this period that clearly drew from Roman law. The general practice during this period, as evidenced from records of cases, seems to have been to defer to specific Scottish laws on a matter when available and to fill in any gaps with provisions from the common law embodied in Civil and Canon law, which had the advantage of being written.|$|E

5|$|In {{accordance}} with the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, a set of regulations promulgated by NASA on July 16 to <b>codify</b> its quarantine protocol, the astronauts continued in quarantine out of concern that the Moon might contain undiscovered pathogens and that the astronauts might {{have been exposed to}} them during their Moon walks. However, after three weeks in confinement (first in the Apollo spacecraft, then in their trailer on the Hornet, and finally in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the Manned Spacecraft Center), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health. On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination met in Atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts, on those who had joined them in quarantine (NASA physician William Carpentier and MQF project engineer John Hirasaki), and on Columbia itself. Loose equipment from the spacecraft would remain in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study.|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, {{these models}} can be {{represented}} in several ways. Petri nets, which were introduced in Carl Adam Petri's 1962 doctoral thesis, were an early attempt to <b>codify</b> the rules of consistency models. Dataflow theory later built upon these, and Dataflow architectures were created to physically implement the ideas of dataflow theory. Beginning in the late 1970s, process calculi such as Calculus of Communicating Systems and Communicating Sequential Processes were developed to permit algebraic reasoning about systems composed of interacting components. More recent additions to the process calculus family, such as the π-calculus, have added the capability for reasoning about dynamic topologies. Logics such as Lamport's TLA+, and mathematical models such as traces and Actor event diagrams, have also been developed to describe the behavior of concurrent systems.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{spent the}} rest of her life in Normandy, often acting as Henry's {{representative}} and presiding over the government of the Duchy. Early on, Matilda and her son issued charters in England and Normandy in their joint names, dealing with the various land claims that had arisen during the wars. Particularly in the initial years of his reign, the King drew on her for advice on policy matters. Matilda was involved in attempts to mediate between Henry and his Chancellor Thomas Becket when the two men fell out in the 1160s. Matilda had originally cautioned against the appointment, but when the Prior of Mont St Jacques asked her for a private interview on Becket's behalf to seek her views, she provided a moderate perspective on the problem. Matilda explained that she disagreed with Henry's attempts to <b>codify</b> English customs, which Becket was opposed to, but also condemned poor administration in the English Church and Becket's own headstrong behaviour.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores ongoing {{debates about}} the role that <b>codified</b> forms of {{knowledge}} play in fostering innovative behaviour. It aims to provide an empirical exploration {{of the use of}} <b>codified</b> sources of information for innovation at the firm and sectoral level. Despite considerable interest in David and Foray’s (1995) work on the codification of knowledge and the changing nature of innovation due to the use of information and communication technologies, there are relatively few empirical studies that probe the role of <b>codified</b> sources of information in the innovation process. Our goal is to assess how important <b>codified</b> sources of information are for innovation among different firms and sectors. We find that use of <b>codified</b> sources of knowledge is highly concentrated in high technology sectors and among firms with existing absorptive capacity. The analysis shows that the use of other sources of information for innovation is a strong predictor of a firm’s use of <b>codified</b> sources. The data used for the analysis is based on The Netherlands Community Innovation Survey (II) for the manufacturing sector and covers over 2001 firms in 11 industries.

5|$|Prior to {{joining the}} court, Deady {{served in the}} {{legislature}} of the Oregon Territory, including time served as the President of the Council, and was elected as President of the Oregon Constitutional Convention in 1857. A native {{of the state of}} Maryland, his first profession was as a blacksmith. He would also spend time as a teacher in both Ohio and Oregon. Deady read law in Ohio and practiced law for a time in that state before immigrating to the Oregon Territory via the Oregon Trail. In Oregon, he helped <b>codify</b> the laws of the state and assisted in the foundation of the Multnomah County Library in Portland. He also was president of the University of Oregon's board of regents. The university renamed Deady Hall in his honor after his death.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also saw}} {{widespread}} attempts to <b>codify</b> {{and comment on}} the Scottish legal system. The first substantive account of Scottish law was the Practicks of Bishop John Sinclair (d. 1566), senator of the College of Justice. This was followed by James Balfour's (c. 1525–83) Practicks, who with Sir John Skene of Curriehill (c. 1543–1617), was a major figure in the move to codification. Skene produced an edition of the Acts of Parliament and a legal dictionary, De Verborum Significatione and edited Regiam Maisestatem, {{a history of the}} Scottish law, which attributed much of its creation to David I. Thomas Craig of Riccarton (c. 1538–1608) produced two large works, Jus Feudale, which examined feudal law, and De Unione Regnorum Britanniae, which explored the possibilities of unifying the English and Scottish legal systems. Often seen as the beginning of modern Scottish legal study is James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair's (1619–95) The Institutions of the Law of Scotland (1681).|$|E
5|$|In 1947, 23 {{countries}} {{concluded the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at a UN conference in Geneva. Delegates intended {{the agreement to}} suffice while member states would negotiate creation of a UN body {{to be known as}} the International Trade Organization (ITO). As the ITO never became ratified, GATT became the de facto framework for later multilateral trade negotiations. Members emphasized trade reprocity as an approach to lowering barriers in pursuit of mutual gains. The agreement's structure enabled its signatories to <b>codify</b> and enforce regulations for trading of goods and services. GATT was centered on two precepts: trade relations needed to be equitable and nondiscriminatory, and subsidizing non-agricultural exports needed to be prohibited. As such, the agreement's most favored nation clause prohibited members from offering preferential tariff rates to any nation that it would not otherwise offer to fellow GATT members. In the event of any discovery of non-agricultural subsidies, members were authorized to offset such policies by enacting countervailing tariffs. The agreement provided governments with a transparent structure for managing trade relations and avoiding protectionist pressures. However, GATT's principles did not extend to financial activity, consistent with the era's rigid discouragement of capital movements. The agreement's initial round achieved only limited success in reducing tariffs. While the U.S. reduced its tariffs by one third, other signatories offered much smaller trade concessions.|$|E
