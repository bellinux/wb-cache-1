5000|$|An {{automatic}} lubrication system (ALS), {{often referred to}} as a <b>centralized</b> <b>lubrication</b> system, is a system that delivers controlled amounts of lubricant to multiple locations on a machine while the machine is operating. Even though these systems are usually fully automated, a system that requires a manual pump or button activation is still identified as a <b>centralized</b> <b>lubrication</b> system. The system can be classified into two different categories that can share {{a lot of the same}} components.|$|E
50|$|The chassis of the Phantom II was {{completely}} new. The front axle was mounted on semi-elliptical leaf springs as on earlier 40/50 hp models, but the rear axle was now also mounted on semi-elliptical springs instead of cantilever springs. This, {{along with the}} drivetrain changes, allowed the frame to be lower than before, improving the handling. The 4-wheel servo-assisted brakes from the Phantom I were continued, and the Bijur <b>centralized</b> <b>lubrication</b> system from the Springfield-built Phantom I was included on all Phantom II chassis.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to a new boiler and firebox, advancements over the class L included a <b>centralized</b> <b>lubrication</b> system, pneumatic grates, power reverse, and roller bearings on all axles. Upon arrival at the SZD testing facility in June 1952 the prototype locomotive was closely examined and found to exceed previous types in tractive effort and horsepower. It was also shown {{to be the most}} efficient design then in operation in Russia, with thermal efficiency of 9.27%. Locomotive OR18-01 was placed into revenue service at Lublin Depot in August 1953.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{automatic}} stuffing {{lubrication system}} can appropriately provide {{a fixed amount}} of high-voltage grease for each lubrication point according to {{the conditions under which}} a vehicle is operated, thus stuffing and lubricating vehicles while they are on the move and automatically monitoring the lubrication conditions during the entire process. The essay focus on not only the analysis of the working condition of chassis <b>centralized</b> stuffing <b>lubrication</b> system, the functions and proper use of controller,sub-oil device,lubrication pump, but also the analysis of the installation and testing methods of <b>centralized</b> grease <b>lubrication</b> system...|$|R
5000|$|Nash's slogan {{from the}} late 1920s and 1930s was [...] "Give the {{customer}} more than he has paid for" [...] and the cars lived up to it. Innovations included a straight-eight engine with overhead valves, twin spark plugs, and nine crankshaft bearings in 1930. The 1932 Ambassador Eight had synchromesh transmissions and free wheeling, automatic <b>centralized</b> chassis <b>lubrication,</b> a worm-drive rear end, and its suspension was adjustable inside the car. A long-time proponent of automotive safety, Nash was among the early mid- and low-priced cars to offer four-wheel brakes.|$|R
5000|$|The factory entered its [...] "golden era" [...] {{during the}} 1980s. During {{this time the}} factory had nearly 20,000 employees. The design offices of Prva Petoletka {{designed}} hydraulic systems {{for many of the}} hydroelectric power plants in Yugoslavia, the hydraulic drive on a class of massive roto-excavators for surface mines, drive- and control-systems for the sets of the National Theatre in Belgrade, electro-hydraulic system for lifting of the main dome of the Temple of Saint Sava in Belgrade, hydraulics for a modern second-generation tank (the M-84), an inclined marine railway installed in the shipyard in Kladovo, landing gear for Boeing, as well as many large <b>centralized</b> <b>lubrication</b> systems in Yugoslavia.|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of energy losses due to friction of kinematical pairs has been studied. The main reasons of devices failure having friction pairs have been defined. The {{advantages and disadvantages}} of automatic <b>centralized</b> <b>lubrication</b> systems have been demonstrated and their classification and areas of application have been provided. The results of the comparison of resource and time-cost for equipment (mining excavators, trolleybuses) with and without centralized automatic lubrication systems have been presented. The concepts of improving the lubrication process and increasing the industrial equipment resource have been offered. ??????????? ????????? ?????????????? ?????? ?? ???? ?????? ?????????????? ???. ?????????? ???????? ??????? ?????? ?? ????? ?????????, ??????? ???? ??????. ???????? ???????????? ? ?????????? ?????????????? ???????????????? ?????? ??????????, ???????????? ?? ????????????? ? ??????? ??????????. ???????????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ? ????????? ?????? ??? ?????

40|$|The work {{is aimed}} at {{improving}} the quality of the lubrication of friction pairs of machines by maintaining a given thickness of the layer of lubricant. The effect is achieved by the use of automatic control of the liquid lubricant supply, which compensates the change in operating conditions. As the base system is selected <b>centralized</b> <b>lubrication</b> system, which is widely used in rolling mills. The mathematical models of the processes in the hydrodynamic bearing system and in automatic stabilization film thickness system were developed. The schematic diagram of the automatic control system was represented. The research confirmed the efficiency of the developed technical solutions. Advantageous effect of the use of the automatic stabilizing system film thickness is to reduce the rate of wear of the friction surfaces and cost savings lubricating fluid. ?????? ?????????? ?? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ??? ?????? ????? ????? ??????????? ???????? ??????? ???? ??????. ?????? ??????????? ????? ????????????? ??????????????? ????????????? ?????? ????????? ????????, ??? ???????????? ????????? ??????? ?????? ?? ???? ?????????????? ??????????? ????????? ???????? ? ??????????. ? ???????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ???????????????? ??????? ??????, ??????? ?????? ??????????? ? ????????? ??????. ??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ????????? ? ????????????????? ?????????? ? ??????? ??????????????? ???????????? ??????? ?????????? ????. ????????? ???????????? ???????. ????????? ?????????????? ????? ??????? ??????????????? ?????????????, ???????? ??????????? ???????? ????????? ??????. ??????????? ???????????? ??????????? ????????????????? ?????????????? ???????????? ???????. ???????? ?????? ?? ????????????? ?????????????? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ?????????? ???? ??????? ? ?????????? ????????????? ?????? ???????????? ?????? ? ?????? ????????? ????????...|$|E
