The company introduced a series of constant temperature circulators with fully electronic control beginning in 1972. In particular, Julabo developed heating and cooling circulators with greater heating and pumping capacity and extended working temperature ranges for use in medical technology and chemical engineering. Other developments included the use of LEDs, precision temperature control directly in an attached system, Pt100 external sensors, and analog interfaces.|$|E

50|$|A sensor with an {{adjustable}} emissivity setting {{can also be}} used to calibrate the sensor for a given surface, or to measure the emissivity of a surface. When the temperature of a surface is accurately known (e.g. by measuring with a <b>contact</b> <b>thermometer),</b> then the sensor's emissivity setting can be adjusted until the temperature measurement by the IR method matches the measured temperature by the contact method; the emissivity setting will indicate the emissivity of the surface, which can be taken into account for later measurements.|$|E
50|$|Early glass contact {{thermometers}} used {{in temperature}} control were equipped with solid contacts. They {{were able to}} switch an attached device, such as a heater, on and off at short intervals {{by way of a}} contact protection relay as well as trigger an acoustic warning function. However, for more complex applications, variable setting of the temperature value was required. Ernst Juchheim, a master designer of glass instruments, fulfilled this requirement in 1926 with the development of the world's first glass <b>contact</b> <b>thermometer</b> with variable temperature adjustment. In 1927, his invention was granted a patent in Germany.|$|E
50|$|Juchheim's glass <b>contact</b> <b>thermometer</b> {{consisted}} of two temperature scales of equal size, constructed of frosted glass, and arranged with {{one on top of}} the other. They were connected by an electrically conductive metal filament and a sliding contact in a capillary tube. The desired temperature was set on the upper scale by sliding a movable magnet on the outside of the thermometer. Sliding the magnet simultaneously moves the tip of the lower scale's metal filament to the same value. As soon as the column of mercury reaches the selected setpoint (due to rising temperature), an electrical contact is established, thereby switching the heating device on and off at short intervals in response to changes in the temperature. This process is repeated continuously and results in a control accuracy of approximately 0.1 °C.|$|E

40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} {{infrared thermometer}} (IRT) accuracy compared to standard digital thermometer in measuring kidney temperature during arterial clamping {{with and without}} renal cooling. Materials and Methods 20 pigs weighting 20 Kg underwent selective right renal arterial clamping, 10 with (Group 1 - Cold Ischemia with ice slush) and 10 without renal cooling (Group 2 - Warm Ischemia). Arterial clamping was performed without venous clamping. Renal temperature was serially measured following clamping of the main renal artery with the IRT and a digital <b>contact</b> <b>thermometer</b> (DT) : immediate after clamping (T 0), after 2 (T 2), 5 (T 5) and 10 minutes (T 10). Temperature values were expressed in mean, standard deviation and range for each thermometer. We used the T student test to compare means and considered p < 0. 05 to be statistically significant. Results In Group 1, mean DT surface temperature decrease was 12. 6 &# 177; 4. 1 &# 176;C (5 - 19 &# 176;C) while deep DT temperature decrease was 15. 8 &# 177; 1. 5 &# 176;C (15 - 18 &# 176;C). For the IRT, mean temperature decrease was 9. 1 &# 177; 3. 8 &# 176;C (3 - 14 &# 176;C). There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between thermometers. In Group 2, surface temperature decrease for DT was 2. 7 &# 177; 1. 8 &# 176;C (0 - 4 &# 176;C) and mean deep temperature decrease was 0. 5 &# 177; 1. 0 &# 176;C (0 - 3 &# 176;C). For IRT, mean temperature decrease was 3. 1 &# 177; 1. 9 &# 176;C (0 - 6 &# 176;C). No statistically significant difference between thermometers was found at any time point. conclusions IRT proved to be an accurate non-invasive precise device for renal temperature monitoring during kidney surgery.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{calibrate}} thermometers {{they have to}} be used to measure the temperature of an isothermal cavity within an appropriate furnace. This temperature has to be compared with the temperature T_ 9 _ 0 measured by means of a normal instrument approximating the International Temperature Scale ITS- 90. Above 962 C the ITS- 90 can be realized only by means of a radiation thermometer. In many applications, however, the application of contact thermometers is required because of technical reasons. The noise thermometer is the only <b>contact</b> <b>thermometer</b> the signal of which is independent on drift behaviour caused by variation of material. Therefore, it is the most appropriate <b>contact</b> <b>thermometer</b> to approximate the ITS- 90 in this temperature range. In order to realize this application a special calibration furnace for temperatures up to 1500 C has been developed making available both isothermal blackbody cavity to measure the radiation temperature and cavities to insert contact thermometers. Special efforts were necessary to suppress electromagnetic fields influencing the measured noise signal and reducing the accuracy of noise thermometer measurement. As an important requirement a long term stability of the furnace temperature could be achieved with a deviation of 0. 1 K after 48 h at 1460 C. Ten separately controlled heating sections allow to optimize the temperature profile {{in the direction of the}} furnace axis and the remaining deviation of #+-# 0. 6 K over a length of 300 mm finally was one of the main error sources. This first direct comparison of the two thermodynamic temperature measurement techniques at 1460 C led to a difference of approximately 0. 2 K. This value being in the range or below the individual uncertainties demonstrates the applicability of a furnace with the described construction for precise calibration of contact thermometers at high temperatures. Thereby approximation of the temperature T_ 9 _ 0 is possible either by radiation or by noise thermometers. (orig.)

40|$|Current {{techniques}} for manual and automated determination of decametre-range are reviewed from information gained by extensive literature search and from visits {{made to a}} wide cross section of European establishments concerned with large-scale dimensional measurements. The reviews, which contain nearly 200 references, provide background information needed by systems designers. A 12 m steel measuring base is described which was length stabilised to within 3 parts in 10 for periods in excess of 500 hours. Temperature of the internal water flow is monitored by a <b>contact</b> <b>thermometer</b> which controls the heat input. The {{theory and practice of}} tensioned-wire dimensional transducers are given which enables this new-class of dimensional measuring instrument to be designed. Two distinct groups of instrument described are those for transducing continuous length changes into electrical signals with better than 5 parts in 10 ^ 6 error and those for detecting changes of 1 part in 10 ^ 10 or smaller, of a nominally fixed length. Continuous subdivision transducers with 12 m and 1 m range are reported which incorporate mechanical mechanisms for obtaining adjustable absolute length, reduction of in-scale accuracy, errors, linear rotary output, rapid following response and simple temperature compensation. A method and practical apparatus are described which uses this type of transducer for automatic control of the position of a workhea moved on a cartesian-frame manipulator. Actual two-dimensional position is measured on a trilateral basis, a technique which eliminates the need for a massive framework when machining or inspecting large workpieces. In-situ numerically-controlled machining is possible with this system. A second frameless technique is described for automatically recording roundness variations of large rings or spigots. Repeatability of 5 parts in 10 ^ 6 or better has been proven to be possible with inexpensive equipment. This method illustrates the use of deformation wire-transducers for dynamic dimensional measurement. A similar type of instrument was used for creep determination of invariwires and carbon-fibres supported on the 12 m base. Results are given which have shown that 1 part in 10 ^ 8 length stability is attainable over considerable periods. It is shown that measurement of earth strains is possible with an invar wire tensioned by a simple beam-balance. Details are given of an experiment performed in a tunnel in which solid-earth tidal strains are recorded within hours of installation. Several other possible applications are discussed for which tensioned-wire transducers seem suited. The use of position-sensitive photocells in dimensional metrology is outlined with particular reference to wire transducers where linear and rotary movements may need monitoring.

Subsurface coal fires monitored by terrestrial measurement by <b>contact</b> <b>thermometers</b> are time-consuming and dangerous because of landslides. That {{is a reason}} why coal fires are mostly monitored by thermal infrared images through remote sensing, i. e. satellite-borne or airborne data, {{which is much more}} suitable for thermal activity monitoring.

40|$|The {{prediction}} {{and measurement}} of the thermal conductivity, k, of crystalline materials, particularly in those with nano-scaled structural features, continues to pose {{a challenge to the}} heat transfer community. One difficulty arises in the correlation of experimental data with the theoretically calculated, direction-specific phonon dispersion characteristics that determine thermal conductivity, such as heat capacity and group velocity. k is often considered a scalar quantity, which implicitly assumes three-dimensional isotropic behavior, e. g., k of wurtzite (hexagonal) aluminum nitride at room temperature is considered to be 320 W/m. K. Although, simultaneously, it is acknowledged that the phonon transport characteristics within crystalline materials varies non- negligibly with direction; we calculate the a-axis and c- axis heat capacity and group velocity at room temperature to be different by approximately a factor of 10 and 2. 5, respectively, favoring basal-plane heat conduction. Experimental measurements may elucidate these phenomena, but fabrication of large single crystals in multiple orientations is impractical for most materials, and in those samples which are commonly single crystal, such as thin films, nanowires, or nanodots, it is difficult to measure the full thermal conductivity tensor. This dissertation then develops two experimental techniques to measure k anisotropy of two substrate-supported thin film systems. An optical technique called thermoreflectance thermometry was utilized to measure the heat transport that takes place only within the plane of Si films, ranging in thickness from 70 nm to 255 nm, atop thermally insulating substrates. The use of an optical method was deployed to preclude possible heat losses from <b>contacted</b> <b>thermometer</b> structures and enabled temperature measurements with sub-miliKelvin resolution, with 4 um spatial resolution. Additionally, heater/thermometer structures, in a 3 w measurement configuration, were used to simultaneously probe the cross-plane and in-plane heat transport characteristics of aluminum nitride thin films, between 500 nm and 750 nm thick, deposited by molecular beam epitaxy on sapphire substrates. Finite element models were applied to fit the measured data, using the thin film thermal conductivity as a free parameter. Finally, the results are discussed with respect to calculations of the heat capacity and group velocity based on phonon dispersion relations, and scattering mechanisms specific to the thin film sample...|$|R
