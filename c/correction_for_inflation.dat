However, one can add the observation that the general negotiations {{in the private sector}} in the spring of 2010 and again in the spring of 2012 resulted in wage increases that were very modest in a historical perspective and for most groups implied falling real wages.

40|$|Despite {{inflation}} and a robust economy, standard Medicare reimbursements for vascular surgical procedures have progressively declined. The {{objective of this}} analysis was to quantitatively and objectively evaluate the decline of vascular surgical reimbursement over the past decade. In this study, data {{for the analysis of}} specific vascular surgical procedures was obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics-National Hospital Discharge Survey (NCHS-NHDS) for all vascular procedures as reported by ICD- 9 -CM codes. The average Medicare reimbursement for each of the specified procedures for 1990 was compared to that of 2001 and the percent change in average reimbursement over this period was calculated. Comparisons between 1990 and 2001 dollar amounts were made after <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> <b>inflation</b> using the consumer price index. This correction factor allows for the calculation of the actual percentage reduction in "real dollars" that is reflected in buying power. We found significant decreases in Medicare reimbursement for each of the vascular procedures included in this analysis.

We feel that these reductions in reimbursement are overzealous and need to be reexamined...|$|E
40|$|AbstractReliability of {{predictions}} from single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) can {{be calculated}} by matrix inversion, {{but that is not}} feasible for large data sets. Two methods of approximating reliability were developed based on the decomposition of a function of reliability into contributions from records, pedigrees, and genotypes. Those contributions can be expressed in record or daughter equivalents. The first approximation method involved inversion of a matrix that contains inverses of the genomic relationship matrix and the pedigree relationship matrix for genotyped animals. The second approximation method involved only the diagonal elements of those inverses. The 2 approximation methods were tested with a simulated data set. The correlations between ssGBLUP and approximated contributions from genomic information were 0. 92 for the first approximation method and 0. 56 for the second approximation method; contributions were inflated by 62 and 258 %, respectively.

40|$|Expansion {{of farms}} in the United States {{commonly}} involves the addition of tracts of land. When these tracts are widely dispersed, considerable distances are travelled by machinery. This results in economic disadvantages and less time for field operation. Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to develop a model to evaluate the adequacy of a machinery complement for a dispersed tract farm in terms of capacity, cost, energy and time. A sensitivity analysis was made using different capacity complements of equipment at varying dispersion distances. ^ The Dispersed Tract Farm (DTF) model was programmed in FORTRAN IV using a series of subroutines. Input data describe the farm tracts and distances, the operations for each crop and the operation time schedule. Also, economic parameters and equipment data are required. ^ The tractor-implement match and operation time is checked before a cost analysis is made. A tractive efficiency model was developed for four-wheel and front-wheel assist drives tractors to use with an existing simple two-wheel drive model. ^ The DTF model computes costs using the time-value approach and a <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> <b>inflation.</b> Field operations costs include fixed, operating, and timeliness costs. Tract costs (travel from tract to tract) include only travelling and timeliness costs. ^ A 650 hectares summer-fallow wheat farm was used in a dispersion sensitivity analysis. The farm had five 130 hectare tracts. One tract contained the farmstead and was fixed in location while the other tracts were dispersed at distances up to 40 km. Four machinery complements with relative capacities of 1. 0, 1. 3, 1. 5 and 1. 7 were used. ^ The tract travel cost per km increased as the dispersion distances increased. Considering the largest complement and dispersion distances of 8, 24 and 40 km, the cost increased 4, 26 and 76 percent compared to the 1. 6 km reference situation. Both the tract energy and time requirements were 2. 10 times higher at 40 km compared to the 8 km dispersion distance. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} internationally agreed limits on public sector debt and deficits, {{such as those}} agreed by the EC countries in the Treaty of Maastricht as preconditions for membership in a monetary union. These fiscal convergence criteria require that general government budget deficits should not exceed 3 % of GDP and that the gross debt of the general government should not be above 60 % of GDP. The Maastricht requirements, especially the debt criterion, are much more stringent than those required to ensure public sector solvency. Their implementation would require an excessive degree of fiscal retrenchment which would adversely affect the level of economic activity. The deficit guideline {{does not appear to}} be sensible, since the numerical criterion refers to the nominal interest payments-inclusive financial deficit, with no <b>corrections</b> <b>for</b> <b>inflation</b> and real output growth, no cyclical adjustment and no appropriate allowance for future revenue-producing public sector investment. The verbal qualifications are too vague to neutralize the potential for serious damage attached to the numerical guidelines. We discuss the various `externality' arguments in favour of binding fiscal rules and find them wanting, both theoretically and empirically. An argument in favour of external enforcement of binding fiscal rules might be made in the presence of `excessive deficits' due to political distortions. We conclude that the fiscal convergence criteria should be disregarded or applied quite loosely in order to avoid the risk of serious fiscal overkill.

40|$|We briefly review several Higgs {{inflation}} {{models and}} discuss their cosmological implications. We first classify the inflation models {{according to the}} predicted value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio: (i) r = O(0. 01 - 0. 1), (ii) r = O(10 ^- 3), and (iii) r ≪ 10 ^- 3. For each case we study (i) the Higgs inflation with a running kinetic term, (ii) the Higgs inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity, and (iii) the B-L Higgs inflation. In the last case we introduce supersymmetry to suppress the Coleman-Weinberg <b>corrections</b> <b>for</b> successful <b>inflation,</b> and derive the upper bound on the SUSY breaking scale. Interestingly, the SUSY B-L Higgs inflation requires the SUSY breaking scale of order O(100) TeV to explain the observed spectral index.

40|$|When {{introducing}} Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) tariffs as {{the basis}} for paying hospitals in Europe, one of the major problems was to find a balancing point between the aim of increasing hospital activity and the need to control global expenditures on hospital care. Consequently, in several European countries, DRG-based reimbursement has been mixed with the already existing forms of hospital reimbursement, such as block budgets, instead of replacing the latter entirely. The mixed reimbursement is viewed as a cautious way of introducing DRG-based funding, which offers the potential for achieving activity expansion without jeopardizing global expenditures control. Denmark is one of the countries where DRG tariffs {{have been added to the}} system of block budgets coupled with activity targets. The transition to the mixed reimbursement occurred by replacing a part of each hospital’s ‘old’ block budget by a ‘new’ DRG-based component. The DRG-based component depends on a hospital’s case mix and applicable DRG tariffs, which are, however, reduced by, e. g. 30 - 50 % as compared with a monetary value of a full tariff. The usual interpretation is that such a mix of reimbursement methods provides a specific set of incentives that is different from other hospital payment methods. Yet, the exact modus operandi of the mixed reimbursement remains obscure. It is not entirely clear whether and how the unit rate of reimbursement was changed after the transition? Was the entire volume of a hospital’s activity affected or only certain treatments and/or higher levels of activity? Another question is what happened with the activity targets that traditionally accompanied the ‘old’ block budgets? The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive description of the change in hospital incentive scheme that followed the transition to the mixed reimbursement in Denmark. In doing so, the paper provides a qualitative assessment of the mixed reimbursement with regard to the asserted exceptionality of its incentive structure, with a particular focus on its ability to balance incentives for activity expansion and global expenditures control. We show that the mixed reimbursement is simply a veiled version of the usual block budget system, which due to certain added complications might even distort activity/efficiency improvements in a new way. The cautions way of implementing DRG –based reimbursement resulted in a system that has hardly moved away from the historical patterns of activity and costs. The sum of the ‘new’ DRG-based component and the remaining part of the ‘old’ block budget simply added up to the total of the ‘old’ block budget (+/- standard annual <b>corrections</b> <b>for</b> <b>inflation,</b> etc.), which allowed hospitals to produce unchanged sort and volume of activity at unchanged unit cost. Only few percent of the annual activity volume is indeed subject to altered reimbursement incentives. In sum, the mixed reimbursement as implemented in Denmark does not present any innovation. Hence, any empirical research based on the assumption that the incentive scheme for the entire volume of hospital activity was changed by the transition to the mixed reimbursement might produce false conclusions.
