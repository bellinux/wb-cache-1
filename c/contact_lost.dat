40|$|Abstract. The Transparent Video Facetop {{is a novel}} user {{interface}} concept that supports not only single-user interactions with a PC, but also close pair collaborations, such as that found in collaborative Web browsing, remote medicine, and in distributed pair programming. In this paper we discuss {{the use of a}} novel video-based UI called the Facetop [16] for solving several problems reported to us by teams doing distributed pair programming. Specifically, the Facetop allows a distributed pair to recapture some the facial expressions and face-to-face communications <b>contact</b> <b>lost</b> in earlier distributed sessions. It also allows members of a distributed pair to point conveniently, quickly, and naturally to their shared work, in the same manner (manually) that they do when seated side-by-side. Our results enhance the ability of organizations to do effective XP-style agile development with distributed teams. 1 Distributed Pair Programming Previous research [17, 19] has indicated that pair programming is better than individual programming in a co-located environment. Do these results also apply to distributed pairs? I...|$|E
40|$|Research {{suggests}} that social networks, social support, and social influence {{are associated with}} weight trajectories among treatment- and non-treatment-seeking individuals. This study examined the impact of having a social contact {{who participated in the}} same group behavioral weight-control intervention in the absence of specific social support training on women engaged in a weight-loss program. Participants (n= 92; 100 % female; 54 % black; mean age: 46 ± 10 years; mean BMI: 38 ± 6) were grouped based upon whether or not they reported a social contact enrolled previously/concurrently in our behavioral weight-control studies. Primary outcomes were 6 -month weight change and treatment adherence (session attendance and self-monitoring). Half of the participants (53 %) indicated that they had a social contact; black women {{were more likely to report}} a social contact than white women (67. 3 % versus 39. 5 %; P< 0. 01). Among participants with a social contact, 67 % reported at least one contact as instrumental in the decision to enroll in the program. Those with a <b>contact</b> <b>lost</b> more weight (5. 9 versus 3. 7 [*]kg; P= 0. 04), attended more group sessions (74 % versus 54 %; P< 0. 01), and submitted more self-monitoring journals (69 % versus 54 %; P= 0. 01) than those without a contact. Participants' weight change was inversely associated with social contacts' weight change (P= 0. 04). There was no association between participant and contact’s group attendance or self-monitoring. Social networks may be a promising vehicle for recruiting and engaging women in a behavioral weight-loss program, particularly black women. The role of a natural social contact deserves further investigation...|$|E

50|$|On 2 January 1945, Neal A. Scott {{departed}} North Africa on {{her return}} voyage, escorting convoy GUS-63 to Hampton Roads. On the 3rd, at 1707, a large {{cloud of smoke}} was seen and an explosion heard {{from the center of}} the first line of the convoy. Neal A. Scott immediately started a submarine search on the starboard bow of the convoy. At 1739 good sonar contact was established and a depth charge attack begun. In the next six minutes 26 charges were dropped. Thirty seconds after the last charge detonated, the rumble of an underwater explosion, followed by the appearance of an oil slick off the escort's port quarter, was reported and sonar <b>contact</b> was <b>lost.</b> At 1755 <b>contact</b> was regained and a hedgehog attack was made. Two to four explosions were heard within the next half minute, and eight more were heard over a minute later, but, again, <b>contact</b> was <b>lost.</b> <b>Contact</b> established again at 1806, a second hedgehog run was made. This time, however, no explosions were reported and the <b>contact</b> was <b>lost.</b> Undiscouraged, the ship continued her search until relieved by British escorts at 2345. Neal A. Scott then returned to the convoy and arrived at Norfolk without further incident on 19 January.|$|R
