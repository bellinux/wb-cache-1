In 2005 PELCHEM initiated {{research into the}} wet oxidation of HFP to produce the higher value fluorocarbon hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO). Although successful in the conversion of HFP to HFPO, the product stream contained both the product and the unreacted HFP. As a result, PELCHEM contracted the Thermodynamics Research Unit at the University of KwaZulu-Natal to investigate the separation of HFP and HFPO. A solvent selection procedure was used to identifY potential solvents and an initial list of two hundred and seven candidate solvents compiled. Utilising the UNIFAC group contribution method, the initial list was narrowed down to thirty solvents using the <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>selectivity</b> at infinite dilution. Through the comparison of specific solvent properties such as recoverability, safety, environmental factors and economic considerations, a final list of ten solvents was generated. The list of ten solvents was proposed to PELCHEM who identified four solvents for further studies. The work involving the two solvents, toluene and hexafluoroethane (RI 16), is presented in this dissertation. The solvent toluene has been previously used by the du Pont company for the separation of HFP and HFPO, while R 116 is a novel solvent for this application. The solvent selection procedure was performed in collaboration {{with a member of}} the Thermodynamics Research Unit, and the work on the remaining two solvents is presented in the dissertation of (Nelson 2008). Experimental binary high pressure vapour liquid equilibrium data were measured for the HFP + toluene, HFPO + toluene, R 116 + HFP, and R 116 + HFPO systems at two temperatures: 273. 15 and 3 13. 15 K. Pure component vapour pressure data for HFPO in the temperature range of 271. 90 to 318. 20 K were also measured. The HPVLE measurements were performed at the Thermodynamics Energy and Phase Equilibria laboratories at Ecoles des Mines de Paris using two experimental techniques and equipment. The binary systems involving toluene were measured on a static synthetic Pressure Volume Temperature apparatus equipped with a variable volume cell. The binary systems involving RI 16 were measured on a static analytic apparatus equipped with a Rapid On-line Sampler Injector. None of the systems measured for this project {{have been reported in the}} literature. The four binary systems and the pure component vapour pressure measurements thus constitute new data sets. All experimental data were modelled via the direct method using the computer software Thermopack. Three model combinations were used to represent the data: the Peng-Robinson equation of state with the Wong-Sandler mixing rules, the Peng-Robinson equation of state with the Modified-Huron-Vidal first order mixing rules, and the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state with the Wong-Sandler mixing rules. The Mathias-Copeman alpha function was used in conjunction with the equation of state models, and the NRTL activity coefficient model was incorporated into the mixing rules. Due to time constraints, experimental data for the binary system HFP + HFPO were not measured. Data for this system was predicted at two temperatures, 273. 15 and 313. 15 K, via the PSRK-UNIFAC method. The critical line for the supercritical systems R 116 + HFP and R 116 + HFPO were calculated in Thermopack. PELCHEM required a commercial grade HFPO product stream of purity greater than 99 % (mole), and a purified HFP product stream of purity greater than 95 % for the recycle and conversion of HFP into HFPO. Using the regressed experimental high pressure vapour liquid equilibrium data, two preliminary separation processes were designed in Aspen Plus to achieve these objectives. The first scheme involved toluene and utilised the process of extractive distillation with toluene introduced as a liquid solvent. The toluene bonded to the HFP and was removed as a bottoms product which allowed a purified HFPO stream to be recovered as a distillate. The second scheme involved RI 16 and utilised the process of gas stripping, with a liquid mixture of HFP and HFPO contacted with a gaseous stream of R 116. The R 116 removed the HFP from the liquid mixture, resulting in a purified HFPO stream. The toluene process resulted in an overall HFPO product recovery of 98. 46 % and HFPO product purity of 99. 88 % (mole). The RI 16 process resulted in an overall HFPO product recovery of 96. 57 % and HFPO product purity of 99. 71 %. For the component HFP, the toluene process resulted in an overall HFP product recovery of 99. 42 % and product purity of 96. 41 %. The RI 16 process resulted in an overall product recovery of 99. 36 % and product purity of 93. 45 %. From a comparison of the preliminary design of the separation processes on the basis of patent issues, performance, and other miscellaneous factors, it was concluded that the RI 16 process compared favourably to the process involving the solvent toluene. The preliminary process designs were presented to PELCHEM in 2007, and pending further experimental work PELCHEM plans to patent the RI 16 separation process...|$|E

40|$|The Problem: Object {{recognition}} in real-world environment {{is still a}} challenging task because of clutter and illumination changes. The question is what is a good representation to describe an object. Motivation: Recently, the use of local descriptors for object recognition has been increasing because of their robustness to occlusion and flexibility to global geometrical deformation. However, there are no formal comparison between sets of oriented receptive fields and non-oriented receptive fields under <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> <b>selectivity</b> and invariance. Previous Work: The Gaussian derivative filters are widely used in the computer vision task. Freeman [1] introduced the “steerable filter”, {{an efficient way to}} compute arbitrarily oriented responses instead of computing derivatives for all the necessary orientations. Although much research has been done using the “steerable filters”, there are no formal comparison between these filters and other commonly used representations, such as gray image patch and Laplacian-based descriptors. Approach: Our criteria for the good representation of the local descriptor are to satisfy both selectivity and invariance, which are tradeoffs. We first compute the distribution of the correlations which is created by computing correlations at all pixel locations with a corner-like pixel location. The distribution changed depending on the local descriptor. For all descriptors, we take correlation thresholds as a selectivity measurement wher...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{capacity}} development {{approach was}} proposed by UNDP and European donors {{as a new}} approach based upon the African aid failure in the 1980 s {{and the end of}} the Cold War instead of conventional aid approach. In this paper, capacity development approach comes into collision with institutional studies in social sciences on purpose to accelerate knowledge evolution. This paper presents a new perspective on the development process and on aid policy. It is named an approach of “capacity development and institutional change”. By using this new approach of “capacity develop-ment and institutional change”, capacity development is able to cover not only technical cooperation but also lending matters. Moreover, the program approach is realized into development strategy and aid policy. The program approach indicates <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> <b>selectivity</b> and priority <b>of</b> allocation of development resources including aid resources. Program approach concentrates more on the policy making process or on the top down (upstream) approach. Furthermore, this paper shows the importance of field experiences, meaning the advantages of Japanese aid compared to European aid, especially with regards to making the program approach more e#ective. The micro (field experience) and macro (top down) loop is a critical factor for aid e#ectiveness. 1...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Looks at the {{pathfinder}} {{approach to}} library instruction, which {{was developed in}} the 1960 s by Patricia Knapp. Knapp’s system focused, not on the simple provision of answers to questions, but on the teaching of the effective use of the library and its resources – in other words, on the finding of one’s “way ” in the library. Design/methodology/approach – A traditional theoretical model for the creation and evaluation of pathfinders (subject research guides) can be identified through study of the literature. This model, expressed in the design <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> consistency, <b>selectivity,</b> transparency and accessibility, sprang from an impulse to serve the inexperienced user by emulating or facilitating the user’s search process. Findings – A gap in this model can be detected, {{in the form of a}} missing multi-dimensional picture of the user and the user’s experience of the information service via the pathfinder. In an attempt to fill the gap, literature examining information behavior, the search process, the design of user-centered services, and the information retrieval interaction is discussed.

The method validation <b>criteria</b> included evaluation <b>of</b> <b>selectivity,</b> analytical curve, trueness, precision, limits of detection and limits of quantification. The non-weighted linear regression model has traditionally been used for calibration, but it is not necessarily the optimal model in all cases. Because the assumption of homoscedasticity was not met for the analytical data in this work, a weighted least squares linear regression was used for the calibration method. The evaluated analytical parameters were satisfactory for the analytes and showed recoveries at four fortification levels between 62 % and 107 %, with relative standard deviations less than 14 %. The detection limits ranged from 7. 6 to 24. 1 ngL− 1.

40|$|Vesicles {{assembled}} from amphiphilic block copolymers represent promising nanomaterials {{for applications}} that include drug delivery and surface functionalization. One essential requirement to guide such polymersomes {{to a desired}} site in vivo is conjugation of active, targeting ligands {{to the surface of}} preformed self-assemblies. Such conjugation chemistry must fulfill <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> efficiency and <b>selectivity,</b> stability <b>of</b> the resulting bond, and biocompatibility. We have here developed a new system that achieves these criteria by simple conjugation of 4 -formylbenzoate (4 FB) functionalized polymersomes with 6 -hydrazinonicotinate acetone hydrazone (HyNic) functionalized antibodies in aqueous buffer. The number of available amino groups on the surface of polymersomes composed of poly-(dimethylsiloxane) -block-poly(2 -methyloxazoline) diblock copolymers was investigated by reacting hydrophilic succinimidyl-activated fluorescent dye with polymersomes and evaluating the resulting emission intensity. To prove attachment of biomolecules to polymersomes, HyNic functionalized enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) was attached to 4 FB functionalized polymersomes, resulting in an average number of 5 eYFP molecules per polymersome. Two different polymersome antibody conjugates were produced using either antibiotin IgG or trastuzumab. They showed specific targeting toward biotin-patterned surfaces and breast cancer cells. Overall, the polymersome ligand platform appears promising for therapeutic and diagnostic use...|$|R
