Thus if A is an m×n simple matrix which has no submatrix which is a row and <b>column</b> permutation of <b>F</b> then n � forb(m, F). Or alternatively if A is an m×(forb(m, F) + 1) simple matrix then A has a submatrix which is a row and <b>column</b> permutation of <b>F.</b> We call F a forbidden configuration.
