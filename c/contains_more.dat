40|$|Abstract. The flavoniods and {{polyphenols}} {{were separated}} from Eucommia ulmoids leaves by resin, at last, four components containing different ingredients were gotten. Two components, {{one of which}} <b>contained</b> <b>more</b> polyphenols, and one of which <b>contained</b> <b>more</b> flavoniods (EUII), were chosen for in vivo antioxidation test. The antioxidation activity in vivo was studied by measuring the content of malondialchehyche (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity in mice orally administrated by EUI and EUII. The results showed that 20 % ethanol elution solution (EUI) <b>contained</b> <b>more</b> polyphenols and 60 % ethanol elution solution (EUII) <b>contained</b> <b>more</b> flavoniods; by comparing with negative control (NC) group, EUI, which <b>contained</b> <b>more</b> polyphenols, showed more obvious antioxidation activities in vivo. The results also meant that polyphenols was the leading working material for Eucommia ulmoids leaves in antioxidation in vivo...|$|R

The appearance of layers, called compositional banding, occurs because the layers, or bands, are of different composition.

The lighter bands <b>contain</b> relatively <b>more</b> felsic (silicate minerals, <b>containing</b> <b>more</b> of the lighter elements, such as silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, and potassium).|$|R

5|$|However, most of {{the rocks}} {{have one thing in}} common; the rocks are {{generally}} hard and erosion-resistant. The Rocky Mountain Trench is thought to be a partial graben, or a long narrow strip of land that has dropped in elevation over time because of parallel faults on both sides. Faults in the Kootenay River watershed trend north-northwest to south-southeast as is common in much of British Columbia. The underlying rock is generally stable and <b>contains</b> <b>more</b> outcroppings of metamorphic and igneous rock as one progresses westwards. Formations of Cambrian and Devonian rock also appear in small amounts in the U.S. portion of the Kootenay.|$|E

5|$|Prokaryotes {{have only}} one lipid bilayer- the cell {{membrane}} (also known as the plasma membrane). Many prokaryotes also have a cell wall, but the cell wall is composed of proteins or long chain carbohydrates, not lipids. In contrast, eukaryotes {{have a range of}} organelles including the nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum. All of these sub-cellular compartments are surrounded by one or more lipid bilayers and, together, typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in the cell. In liver hepatocytes for example, the plasma membrane accounts for only two percent of the total bilayer area of the cell, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum <b>contains</b> <b>more</b> than fifty percent and the mitochondria a further thirty percent.|$|E

5|$|Research {{has shown}} that the {{consumption}} of hot chocolate can be positive to one's health. A study conducted by Cornell University {{has shown that}} hot chocolate <b>contains</b> <b>more</b> antioxidants than wine and tea, therefore reducing the risk of heart disease.

Chang Yong Lee, the professor and researcher at Cornell who conducted the study, revealed that larger amounts of antioxidants are released when the beverage is heated.|$|E
