30|$|The FGM- 3 and FGM- 3 h sensors both produce TTL pulse streams with {{frequencies}} {{ranging from}} the 10 s to 100 s of kHz. We {{have found that the}} 8 -bit “PIC” series of microcontrollers from Microchip, Inc. are ideal high-speed pulse counters, because, unlike many similar microcontrollers, PIC microcontrollers allow external clocking of some of their internal 16 -bit registers, which can thus act as counters. The NPM uses twin PIC 18 F 252 microcontrollers (Microchip Technology Inc., 2006), each having two externally clocked 16 -bit counters. Because the output frequency of the magnetic sensors is sufficiently high to overflow the counters over the course of one second, frequency is measured by reading the stored counts added to the <b>counter</b> <b>range</b> multiplied by the number of timer overflows that occurred over the course of 1 second. The PIC counters return the resulting frequency measurement over a 9600 -baud TTL-level serial data stream, which is easily read by the control microcontroller. As each PIC is able to count two pulse streams, one of the PICs returns the frequencies of sensors X and Y, while the second PIC returns the frequency of sensor Z, leaving a spare channel.|$|E

The photoproduction of neutral [pi] mesons from hydrogen {{has been studied}} at the California Institute of Technology Synchrotron Laboratory by detecting recoil protons from a liquid hydrogen target irradiated by the synchrotron bremsstrahlung beam. The recoil protons were detected by a five counter telescope which comprised a standard three scintillation <b>counter</b> <b>range</b> telescope plus an additional dE/dx counter for more positive identification of the proton and a Cerenkov counter in anticoincidence to eliminate events due to multiple electrons. The effect of recoil protons from pion pair production was reduced by lowering the bremsstrahlung endpoint energy to about 100 mev above that of the photons producing the desired events. Even so, contamination was significant at forward proton angles and correction for this effect was necessary.

40|$|In {{previous}} works, we {{have shown}} two-car households to be better suited than one-car households for leveraging {{the potential benefits of}} the battery electric vehicle (BEV), both when the BEV simply replaces the second car and when it is used optimally in combination with a conventional car to overcome the BEV’s range limitation and increase its utilization. Based on a set of GPS-measured car movement data from 64 two-car households in Sweden, we here assess the potential electric driving of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) in a two-car household and compare the resulting economic viability and potential fuel substitution to that of a BEV. Using estimates of near-term mass production costs, our results suggest that, for Swedish twocar households, the PHEV in general should have a higher total cost of ownership than the BEV, provided the use of the BEV is optimized. However, the PHEV will increasingly be favored if, for example, drivers cannot or do not want to optimize usage. In addition, the PHEV and the BEV are not perfect substitutes. The PHEV may be favored if drivers require that the vehicle be able to satisfy all driving needs (i. e., if drivers don’t accept the range and charge-time restrictions of the BEV) or if drivers requires an even larger battery in the BEV to <b>counter</b> <b>range</b> anxiety. We find that, given a particular usage strategy, the electric drive fraction (EDF) of the vehicle fleet is less dependent on whether PHEVs or BEVs are used to replace one of the conventional cars in two-car households. Instead, the EDF depends more on the usage strategy, i. e., on whether the PHEV/BEV is used to replace the conventional car with the higher annual mileage (“the first car”), the less used car (“the second car”), or is used flexibly to substitute for either in order to optimize use. For example, from a fuel replacement perspective it is often better to replace the first car with a PHEV than to replace the second with a BEV...|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} black carbon (BC) vertical profiles measured at high-resolution over three Italian basin valleys (Terni Valley, Po Valley and Passiria Valley) is presented. BC vertical profiles are scarcely available in literature. The campaign lasted 45 days {{and resulted in}} 120 measured vertical profiles. Besides the BC mass concentration, measurements along the vertical profiles also included aerosol size distributions in the optical particle <b>counter</b> <b>range,</b> chemical analysis of filter samples and {{a full set of}} meteorological parameters. Using the collected experimental data, we performed calculations of aerosol optical properties along the vertical profiles. The results, validated with AERONET data, were used as inputs to a radiative transfer model (libRadtran). The latter allowed an estimation of vertical profiles of the aerosol direct radiative effect, the atmospheric absorption and the heating rate in the lower troposphere. The present measurements revealed some common behaviors over the studied basin valleys. Specifically, at the mixing height, marked concentration drops of both BC (range: from − 48. 4 ± 5. 3 to − 69. 1 ± 5. 5 %) and aerosols (range: from − 23. 9 ± 4. 3 to − 46. 5 ± 7. 3 %) were found. The measured percentage decrease of BC was higher than that of aerosols: therefore, the BC aerosol fraction decreased upwards. Correspondingly, both the absorption and scattering coefficients decreased strongly across the mixing layer (range: from − 47. 6 ± 2. 5 to − 71. 3 ± 3. 0 % and from − 23. 5 ± 0. 8 to − 61. 2 ± 3. 1 %, respectively) resulting in a single-scattering albedo increase along height (range: from + 4. 9 ± 2. 2 to + 7. 4 ± 1. 0 %). This behavior influenced the vertical distribution of the aerosol direct radiative effect and of the heating rate. In this respect, the highest atmospheric absorption of radiation was predicted below the mixing height (~ 2 – 3 times larger than above it) resulting in a heating rate characterized by a vertical negative gradient (range: from − 2. 6 ± 0. 2 to − 8. 3 ± 1. 2 K day − 1 km − 1). In conclusion, the present results suggest that the BC below the mixing height has the potential to promote a negative feedback on the atmospheric stability over basin valleys, weakening the ground-based thermal inversions and increasing the dispersal conditions...|$|E

We observe, {{in addition to the}} finite alphabet of actions, the values taken by the counters along a run of the automaton, and consider the data languages recognized by these automata. The problem addressed in this paper is the inclusion between the data languages recognized by such automata. Since the problem is undecid-able, we give an abstraction-refinement semi-algorithm, proved to be sound and complete, but whose termination is not guaranteed. The novel feature of our technique is checking for inclusion, without at-tempting to complement one of the automata, i. e. working in the spirit of antichain-based non-deterministic inclusion checking for finite automata [1]. The method described here has various applications, ranging from logics of unbounded data structures, such as arrays or heaps, to the ver-ification of real-time systems. ...|$|R

A fundamental question in formal verification is if the behaviour of one process is reproducible by another. This inclusion problem can be studied for various models of computation and behavioural preorders. It is generally intractable or even undecidable already for very limited computational models. The aim of this work is to clarify {{the status of the}} decidability {{and complexity of}} some well-known inclusion problems for suitably restricted computational models. In particular, we address the problems of checking strong and weak simulation and trace inclusion for processes definable by one-counter automata (OCA), that consist of a finite control and a single <b>counter</b> <b>ranging</b> over the non-negative integers. We take special interest of the subclass of one-counter nets (OCNs), that cannot fully test the counter for zero and which is subsumed both by pushdown automata and Petri nets / vector addition systems.

The proposal seeks to maintain maximum precision {{within the limits of}} data transmission bandwidth, to retain two-dimensional cluster reconstructability and to monitor statistically the background. Two thresholds (high and low) are employed to facilitate understanding of the cluster neighbourhoods. This choice also helps to suppress single high background peaks and provides a statistically cleaner sample for background monitoring. Background average and standard deviation are monitored by counting the zero signal (due to negative inputs to the ADCs) and the signals above the thresholds, then using a minimisation algorithm. Background counts which overflow the small <b>counter</b> <b>ranges</b> are discarded to avoid wasting bits and then corrected statistically offline. First the 10 -bit output of the ADCs is compressed to 8 bits using a quasi-parabolic monotonic characteristic which requires no conversion table, no clock cycles and in which all codes are utilised. The expansion to the original values for offline analysis includes a compensation for the truncated signals which is statistically without bias. The main algorithm is purely combinatorial and thus requires only one clock cycle to code the signals and send them on through a circular twisted barrel shifter to the output FIFO.
