5|$|Adherents of {{many other}} {{religions}} reside predominantly in the urban centers of Texas. In 1990, the Islamic population was about 140,000 with more recent figures putting the <b>current</b> <b>number</b> of Muslims between 350,000 and 400,000. The Jewish population is around 128,000. Around 146,000 adherents of religions such as Hinduism and Sikhism live in Texas. It is the fifth-largest Muslim-populated state in the country.|$|E
5|$|Demographics professors from Zagreb Faculty of Economics {{predict that}} the {{population}} will decrease by 350.000 people by 2030, based on <b>current</b> <b>number</b> of children born and people emigrating. Population going below 4 {{million people in the}} next 15 years can be avoided in only two ways - if 350.000 more people immigrate than {{the number of people who}} emigrate or if the number of children born almost doubles. Experts believe both options are unlikely.|$|E

5|$|The {{cemetery}} contained 245 German and 188 British graves {{at the end}} of the war. This number {{increased in}} the post-war period, as both British and German remains from numerous isolated burial locations were concentrated to St. Symphorien until the cemetery reached its <b>current</b> <b>number</b> of 284 German soldiers and 229 Commonwealth soldiers. Most of the identified German dead in the cemetery died in 1914 and were from units of IX Corps, which originated from the north of Germany from towns like Kiel, Hamburg and Bremen, and in Schleswig-Holstein.|$|E
5|$|The {{highway is}} {{a section of}} the former Dixie Highway and US25 in the state. It was first added to the state highway system in 1926 and given its <b>current</b> <b>number</b> in 1973. Previously there were two other {{highways}} that carried the M-125 moniker. One in the 1930s ran through the Upper Peninsula near Thompson and a second from 1938 until the mid-1950s was located in Bay County. The current designation was created in 1973 when US25 was decommissioned in Michigan. The section in downtown Monroe was named what is now a Pure Michigan Byway in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The current freeway {{numbered}} I-196 is {{the second}} {{in the state to}} bear the number. Originally to be numbered as part of the I-94 corridor in the state, the Benton Harbor–Grand Rapids freeway was given the I-96 number in the 1950s while another Interstate between Muskegon and Grand Rapids was numbered I-196. That I-196 was built in the late 1950s and completed in the early 1960s. The first segment of the current I-196 was opened as I-96 near Benton Harbor in 1962. Michigan officials requested a change in 1963, which reversed the two numbers and the subsequent segments of freeway opened northward to Holland and from Grand Rapids westward under the <b>current</b> <b>number.</b> The gap between Holland and Grandville was filled in the 1970s, and a section of freeway that runs through downtown Grand Rapids was rebuilt as a wider freeway in 2010.|$|E

50|$|For a {{short time}} before the <b>current</b> <b>numbering</b> plan, two prefixes were {{implemented}} for toll-free numbers (080-xxx-xxx) and premium rate numbers (089-xxx-xxx). However, until {{the implementation of the}} <b>current</b> <b>numbering</b> plan, all the 018xx and 0xx89 numbers remained unchanged. A special call barring service has been introduced to prevent fraudulent calls to premium rate services. Even today there still are local numbers starting with 89, but only for internet dial-up, and they are migrating to the new prefix 0870.|$|R

40|$|The Internet’s <b>current</b> <b>numbering</b> {{system is}} nearing exhaustion: Existing {{protocols}} allow only a finite set of computer numbers (“IP addresses”), and central authorities will soon deplete their supply of available numbers. I begin by presenting the unusual institutions {{that support the}} <b>current</b> <b>numbering</b> system, including self-regulatory systems that have managed current resources without detailed government oversight. I then consider the IPv 6 standard that would dramatically expand Internet addressing. But I argue that network incentives impede transition to v 6 – effectively requiring mechanisms to preserve the <b>current</b> IPv 4 <b>numbering</b> system. I consider the possible effects of allowing paid transfers of IP addresses, with special emphasis on rules to ameliorate the worst effects of v 4 scarcity, while preserving the core principles of existing regulation and avoiding major negative externalities...|$|R
