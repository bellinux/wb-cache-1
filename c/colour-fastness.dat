Choice of dopant could greatly improve the surface resistance. The optimum coating on textiles {{with the lowest}} surface resistance, highest <b>colour-fastness</b> and stability was achieved using a mist polymerization method with 1, 8 -bis(pyrrolyl) octane, iron(III) chloride (FeCl 3) as the oxidant and p-toluene sulfonic acid sodium salt (p TSA) as the dopant. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Turkey red {{textiles}} {{were major}} economic commodities for the 19 th-century industrial powerhouses of Glasgow and Manchester. An accomplished feat of dyeing technology and chemical complexity, the multi-step Turkey red dyeing process and its fabled superior <b>colour-fastness</b> has remained compellingly mysterious {{for over a}} century. Innovative cross-disciplinary, process-based heritage science research by the University of Glasgow is now unravelling secrets of past production methods and materials to inform the preservation and display for museum and archive Turkey red textile collections. Central to the research is identifying key chemical markers to distinguish real Turkey red from imitations for collection significance and material behaviour prediction, especially <b>colour-fastness.</b> Re-creation of the process by historical technical research informed by modern dye chemistry and organic synthesis, combined with comparative analytical studies of historical examples by 1 H and 13 C NMR, ATR-FTIR, diffuse FTIR (DRIFTS), UHPLC-PDA and LC-MS, reveals signature material markers for true Turkey red and explains why such a chemically-complex process was needed. Hand-held DRIFTS is proving highly useful for non-invasive screening of historical collections to detect oil residues as chemical signatures of the true process, while increased sensitivity from UHPLC-PDA greatly reduces sample sizes for dye analysis to detect photosensitive and labile components and to distinguish the anthraquinones of traditional natural madder dyes from synthetic alizarin equivalents used commercially from 1870. Placing the analytical results within historical contexts of commercial technology is offering a unique perspective on primary material evidence for the collections care of Turkey red textiles...|$|E
30|$|When {{the paint}} was freshly made, each sample was {{digitally}} scanned at 300  dpi with a colour reference card using an Epson XP scanner. Paint samples were then {{stored in a}} brown paper envelope in a dark box away from direct light to imitate the conditions of an enclosed manuscript book. Only 1 sample was exposed to daylight for several months to measure the stability in an open environment. After several months, {{and in some cases}} 4  years, the paint samples were re-scanned and the results compared with the original digital scans. By this means the <b>colour-fastness</b> and stability of the paint samples could be evaluated, identifying any colour changes in real-time ageing.|$|E
40|$|Ergonomics are defined, and the {{ergonomic}} principle {{translated into}} an ideal design through a uniform called an ergo-uniform. The concept of "uniform" is discussed with the enormous variety, significance and functional properties {{found in all}} aspects of life. Five reasons for wearing a uniform are listed {{and the ways in which}} work uniforms should reflect the environment where they are worn. The requirements of an ergo-uniform are specified with the many advantages which can accrue from appropriate design. Uniform components include aspects of comfort - thermal-wet comfort, pressure comfort, tactile comfort and non-allergenic properties. Appropriate dress and its benefits are discussed, with a fashionable, up-to-date appearance necessary to promote the image of the organisation. Garment fit is essential, with four contributory factors: weight, ease of movement, pressure on the body surface and ventilation. <b>Colour-fastness</b> is essential, with easy aftercare, impeccable tailoring, quality workmanship, durability and elasticity. The construction of an ergo-uniform requires knowledge of fabric materials, fabric structure and dyeing and finishing. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
