40|$|International audienceDeductive {{reasoning}} is traditionally {{viewed as a}} unitary process involving either rule-based or visuo-spatial mechanisms. However, there is a disagreement in the neuroimaging literature on whether the data support one alternative over the other. Here we test the hypothesis that discrepancies in the literature result from the reasoning materials themselves. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measure brain activity of participants while they integrate the premises of <b>conditional</b> <b>arguments</b> (primarily Modus Tollens: If P then Q; not-Q) and Relational Syllogisms (i. e., linear arguments of the sort P is {{to the left of}} Q; Q is to the left of R). We find that reasoning with Modus Tollens activates the left inferior frontal gyrus {{to a greater extent than}} the Relational Syllogisms. In contrast, the Relational Syllogisms engage the right temporo-parieto-occipital junction more than <b>conditional</b> <b>arguments.</b> This suggests that conditional reasoning relies more on so-called syntactic processes than relational reasoning, while relational reasoning may rely on visuo-spatial processes and mental imagery more than conditional reasoning. This investigative approach, together with its results, clarifies some apparently inconsistent findings in this literature by showing that the nature of the logical argument, whether it is relational or conditional, determines which neural system is engaged...|$|R

40|$|Argumentative thought {{experiments}} are structurally conditional clauses. They can hence be formalized {{by means of}} the principle of modus ponendo ponens, as well as of modus tollendo tollens. In contrast to the practice in formal logic, exponents of argumentative thought experiments claim that the logical validity of a conclusion drawn within the framework of a particular <b>conditional</b> <b>argument</b> also holds beyond the particular conditional in question. In this paper, I articulate the criticism that this claim is wrong by arguing that the counterfactual scenario sets itself the most determinant premise. If the counterfactual scenario sets the initial conditional premise of the argument, then its true conclusion holds only as a counterfactual truth. The present paper illustrates this criticism using Frank Jackson’s thought experiment, the so-called knowledge argument, as a concrete example...|$|E

He soon became dissatisfied with this third way of being and replaced it by his infamous “outside being [Außersein] of the pure object”, a mode of objectuality according to which {{we can say that}} there objects which have no mode of being. I will first show that Meinong’s argument to reject its third kind of being is defective and can be avoided by adopting Ingarden’s kind of existential pluralism. I will then show that the adoption of the Ingardenian variety of existential pluralism contradicts the Meinongian variety on two important ontological points and that a <b>conditional</b> <b>argument</b> in favour of the first sort of existential pluralism may be formulated if a distinction between two kinds of intentional objects is introduced. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E
40|$|This note is {{concerned}} with a carrier-borne epidemic in which the individuals initially susceptible pass through successive stages of infection and get eventually removed by repeated contacts with carriers. The model proposed here constitutes a generalized version of Gani’s model [1] and is studied by a different method based on a direct <b>conditional</b> <b>argument.</b> First, the time-dependent behaviour of the conditional process of the susceptibles and the infectives in the successive stages, given any realization of the carrier process, is obtained using a simple martingale approach. Several particular processes for the carriers, together with different functions for their global contact rate with the other individuals, are then considered and analyzed. Combining these results leads easily to {{the building of the}} joint probability generating function of the numbers of susceptibles, infectives and carriers present {{at any time in the}} population. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

40|$|The present {{research}} examines descriptive models of probabilistic conditional reasoning, {{that is of}} reasoning from uncertain conditionals with contents about which reasoners have rich background knowledge. According to our dual-source model, two types of information shape such reasoning: knowledge-based information elicited by {{the contents of the}} material and content-independent information derived from the form of inferences. Two experiments implemented manipulations that selectively influenced the model parameters for the knowledge-based information, the relative weight given to form-based versus knowledge-based information, and the parameters for the form-based information, validating the psychological interpretation of these parameters. We apply the model to classical suppression effects dissecting them into effects on background knowledge and effects on form-based processes (Exp. 3) and we use it to reanalyse previous studies manipulating reasoning instructions. In a model-comparison exercise, based on data of seven studies, the dual-source model outperformed three Bayesian competitor models. Overall, our results support the view that people make use of background knowledge in line with current Bayesian models, but they also suggest that the form of the <b>conditional</b> <b>argument,</b> irrespective of its content, plays a substantive, yet smaller, role...|$|E
40|$|According to {{quantitative}} studies, oil {{seems the}} only natural resource that is robustly linked to civil war onset. However, recent debates on {{the nexus of}} oil and internal conflict have neglected {{the fact that there}} are a number of peaceful rentier oil states in existence. Few efforts have been made to explain why some oil-exporting countries have experienced civil war while others have not. We thus address this puzzle, by arguing that civil war risks depend on the specific conditions of oil production and how they come to structure state–society relations. Specifically, we expect that states that are either highly dependent on oil or who have problematic relations with oil regions are prone to civil war. However, these risks will be mitigated either when democratic institutions can manage conflicts peacefully or when abundant oil revenues can be spent in such a way as to buy peace. We test this <b>conditional</b> <b>argument</b> by comparing 39 net oil exporters, using a (crisp-set) Qualitative Comparative Analysis – a methodology particularly suited to test conditional relationships in medium-N samples. Our results largely confirm our conditional hypotheses. Conditions of oil production are ambiguous, and particular combinations thus explain the onset of civil war. Specifically, we find that high abundance is sufficient to ensure peace, while two distinct pathways lead to civil war: the combination of high dependence and low abundance, as well as the overlap of ethnic exclusion and oil reserves in non-abundant and non-democratic oil states...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the default}} interventionist dual-process account of reasoning, belief-based {{responses}} to reasoning tasks {{are based on}} Type  1 processes generated by default, which must be inhibited {{in order to produce}} an effortful, Type  2 output based on the validity of an argument. However, recent research has indicated that reasoning on the basis of beliefs may not be as fast and automatic as this account claims. In three experiments, we presented participants with a reasoning task that was to be completed while they were generating random numbers (RNG). We used the novel methodology introduced by Handley, Newstead & Trippas (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 37, 28 – 43, 2011), which required participants to make judgments based upon either the validity of a <b>conditional</b> <b>argument</b> or the believability of its conclusion. The results showed that belief-based judgments produced lower rates of accuracy overall and were influenced {{to a greater extent than}} validity judgments by the presence of a conflict between belief and logic for both simple and complex arguments. These findings were replicated in Experiment 3, in which we controlled for switching demands in a blocked design. Across all three experiments, we found a main effect of RNG, implying that both instructional sets require some effortful processing. However, in the blocked design RNG had its greatest impact on logic judgments, suggesting that distinct executive resources may be required for each type of judgment. We discuss the implications of our findings for the default interventionist account and offer a parallel competitive model as an alternative interpretation for our findings. 20 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The data {{of three}} {{experiments}} (Campion, in press) {{confirm that the}} readers of texts including <b>conditional</b> <b>arguments</b> process the <b>conditional</b> syntax as an asymmetric constraint which warrants the Modus Ponens, a logically valid inference.

Thus, according to the theory of natural logic, the readers can make formal deductions, such as the modus Ponens.

40|$|Clustered binary {{longitudinal}} data often involve {{more than two}} sources of correlation. Human papillomavirus (HPV) International transmission (HIT) study {{is an example of}} clustered {{longitudinal data}} where correlation arises in three ways: correlation between gender within couple, temporal correlation among repeated measurements on the same genotype over time, and directionless clustering due to the multiple genotypes tested within an individual. Current statistical approaches that are used to identify risk factors does not appropriately take into account multiple sources of correlation within a cluster. In this type of data, we are often also interested in modeling persistence of the outcome, but there is no standardized method to calculate persistence, and account for multiple sources of correlation at the same time. For HPV study, given the scientific definition of 12 -month persistence, second order transition model provides us with a useful tool. Additionally, we implement Quasi-Least squares (QLS) approach in order to adjust for multiple sources of correlation, and present a combined method of transition model and QLS approach for such data. Using this approach, full specification of the joint multivariate binary distribution is avoided by using <b>conditional</b> <b>argument</b> to handle the temporal correlation and QLS to account for the two sources of correlation. A simulation study is performed for exchangeable correlation structures to compare the proposed approach with commonly used Generalized estimating Equations (GEE). The results demonstrate good coverage probabilities for regression parameter estimates. We also take into account clustering effect when performing imputation missing values, compare with imputation strategies ignoring clustering effect. Using random intercept model with multiple clusters produced increased coverage probabilities for regression parameters. The proposed analytic and imputation model is applied to the HIT data to identify modifiable risk factors for 12 -month persistence in couple. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{begins with}} {{a review of the}} {{literature}} on plausible reasoning with deductive <b>arguments</b> containing a <b>conditional</b> premise. There is concurring evidence that people presented with valid <b>conditional</b> <b>arguments</b> such as Modus Ponens and Modus Tollens generally do not endorse the conclusion, but rather find it uncertain, in case (i) the plausibility of the major conditional premise is debatable, (ii) the major conditional premise is formulated in frequentist or probabilistic terms, or (iii) an additional premise introduces uncertainty about the major conditional premise. This third situation gives rise to non monotonic effects by a mechanism that can be characterised as follows: the reasoner is invited to doubt the major conditional premise by doubting the satisfaction of a tacit condition which is necessary for the consequent to occur. Three experiments are presented. The first two aim to generalise the latter result using various types of conditionals and the last shows that performance in conditional reasoning is significantly affected by the representation of the task.

Using qualitative methods, {{we examined the}} clinical relevance of under-representation of subgroups of patients, and the underlying arguments. METHODS: Interviews with 47 physicians and pharmacists involved in the pre- or post-marketing evaluation of cardiovascular drugs, addressing the issue in general and for two new drugs, losartan and atorvastatin, in particular. RESULTS: The respondents were generally familiar with the under-representation of elderly patients, female patients, and patients with comorbidity in pre-marketing trials, but less familiar with details of representation {{in the cases of}} losartan and atorvastatin. In particular under-representation of patients with comorbidity was considered relevant. Arguments to confirm or refute the relevance referred to trial methodology, applicability of trial results or aspects of patient treatment. <b>Conditional</b> <b>arguments</b> referred to the aim of the trial, population size, therapeutic drug class or the timing of trials prior to or after drug registration.

It is thought that this imprecision is to some extent responsible for the erroneous development decisions which lead to the introduction of defects in software systems.

The EEG study (Experiment 2) reveals that the minor premise in AC arguments prompts both Rejecters and Endorsers to produce an N 200 wave, which the literature associates with a violation of expectations. These findings suggest that the second premise of AC arguments arrives unexpectedly even among those who are ultimately Endorsers.
