25|$|The {{pressure}} of fuel from the fuel pump pushes against the diaphragm in chamber C, moving the servo valve toward the <b>closed</b> <b>position.</b> The fuel also flows to the mixture control valve, which is closed {{when in the}} idle-cutoff position and open in all other positions.|$|E
25|$|Inward opening {{doors are}} doors {{that can only}} be opened (or forced open) from outside a building. Such doors pose a {{substantial}} fire risk to occupants of occupied buildings when they are locked. As such doors can only be forced open from the outside, building occupants would be prevented from escaping. In commercial and retail situations manufacturers have included in the design a mechanism that allows an inward opening door to be pushed open outwards {{in the event of an}} emergency (which is often a regulatory requirement). This is known as a 'breakaway' feature. Pushing the door outward at its <b>closed</b> <b>position,</b> through a switch mechanism, disconnects power to the latch and allows the door to swing outward. Upon returning the door to the <b>closed</b> <b>position,</b> power is restored.|$|E
25|$|Some {{cars from}} the 1920s to early 1960s used {{retractable}} semaphores called trafficators rather than flashing lights. They were commonly mounted high {{up behind the}} front doors and swung out horizontally. However, they were fragile and could be easily broken off and also {{had a tendency to}} stick in the <b>closed</b> <b>position.</b> These can be fitted with flashing lights as an upgrade.|$|E

25|$|The Lindy Hop is {{only one}} of many swing dances popular today, and there are {{thriving}} local communities throughout the world. Structurally, lindy hop's most popular step -- the swing-out -- combines both <b>closed</b> <b>position</b> and open position and is clearly related to the Charleston. It is the most popular swing dance in most swing dancing communities, and its revival in the 1980s has since seen local communities develop in many cities.|$|E

In the first position (also called <b>closed</b> <b>position)</b> on a B trombone, the notes in the harmonic series begin with B2 (one octave higher than the pedal B1), F3 (a perfect fifth higher than the previous partial), B3 (a perfect fourth higher), D4 (a major third higher), and F4 (a minor third higher).|$|E
25|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear whether the preorbital gland {{secretions}} of North American deer emit an odor that is significant in terms of chemical communication. Most of the time, the glands remain in the <b>closed</b> <b>position,</b> but {{they are capable of}} opening them in certain circumstances. For example, a rutting male may dilate its preorbital glands in order to signal aggression to another nearby male. Female deer often open their glands while caring for their young.|$|E

25|$|In its <b>closed</b> <b>position,</b> a {{swing bridge}} {{carrying}} a road or railway over a river or canal, for example, allows traffic to cross. When a water vessel needs {{to pass the}} bridge, road traffic is stopped (usually by traffic signals and barriers), and then motors rotate the bridge horizontally about its pivot point. The typical swing bridge will rotate approximately 90 degrees, or one-quarter turn; however, a bridge which intersects the navigation channel at an oblique angle may be built to rotate only 45 degrees, or one-eighth turn, in order to clear the channel.|$|E
25|$|The Umnumzaan {{implements}} {{a version}} of the Chris Reeve Integral Lock. The original Integral Lock (sometimes referred to as the “frame lock” or“titanium frame lock”) developed by Reeve in 1987, was first implemented in the Sebenza folding pocket knife. This lock employs a titanium lock bar, milled out of the knife's handle material. At lock up, the titanium lock bar comes in direct contact with the back of the blade, thus locking the blade in the open position. The Umnumzaan Integral Lock utilizes a ceramic ball that serves two functionsthe ball acts as the interface between the blade locking surface and the integral locking arm as the knife assumes the open position. The ball also mates with a detent in the blade in the <b>closed</b> <b>position</b> to secure the blade from opening accidentally.|$|E
25|$|The {{convertible}} roof is fully automatic — an unusual feature {{in such a}} small car — and can be opened partially {{to act as a}} sunroof whilst the car is driving at speed. The convertible model forsakes the rear hatchback of the Hardtop Mini, replacing it with a drop down 'tailgate' that is reminiscent of the classic Mini — it incorporates similarly prominent external hinges, and with the roof in the <b>closed</b> <b>position,</b> the rear roof section and luggage shelf can be raised with two handles, semi-tailgate style, to access the luggage space easier. The convertible also adds two small power windows for the rear seat passengers which are lowered automatically when the roof opens. The roof is made from a heavy cloth, with many layers of insulation; the rear window is glass with an integral heater/defroster, but no washer or wiper.|$|E

25|$|Bordeaux {{has five}} road bridges that cross the Garonne, the Pont de pierre {{built in the}} 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, {{just south of the}} Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the Pont d'Aquitaine, a {{suspended}} bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont François Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas, was constructed in 2009–2012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a vertical-lift bridge with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in <b>closed</b> <b>position,</b> and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the waltz was {{significantly}} different from its form today. In the first place, the couples did not dance in the <b>closed</b> <b>position</b> as today. The illustrations and descriptions {{make it clear that}} the couples danced with arm positions {{similar to that of the}} precursor dances, the Ländler and the Allemande. The hold was at times semi-closed, and at times side by side. Arms are intertwined and circling movements were made under raised arms. No couple in Wilson's plate are shown in close embrace, but some are in closed hold facing each other. There was another significant difference from our present technique. The feet were turned out and the rise of foot during the dance was much more pronounced than it is today. This can be seen quite clearly in the figure, and such a style imposes its limitations on how the dance can be performed.|$|E
25|$|The SG 550 has a side-folding {{skeletonized}} buttstock (folds to {{the right}} side of the receiver) and a lightweight aluminium bipod that folds into grooves in the lower handguard. The hinged stock is firmly locked in the folded position by a socket in the butt which clips into a plastic stud on the handguard; a firm pull will release the stock which is then swung into the <b>closed</b> <b>position</b> and locked by a button catch. A collapsible side-folding stock is also available. The stock, pistol grip, and handguards are made of a high-strength polymer, and are produced in either green or black colour options. The steel receiver housing and several other components are manufactured using stamping and welding; external steel surfaces are finished with a ceramic-reinforced enamel coat known as Ilaflon. The gas system's components are made of stainless steel. The barrel, bolt, bolt carrier, and firing pin are all made with steel that has been gas nitrided, hardened and tempered. The bolt and carrier, along with most other components internal to the receiver undergo a phosphating process.|$|E

25|$|In December 2009 Alison Grieve, a 32-year-old {{waitress}} and event manager from Bruntsfield, Edinburgh, {{witnessed a}} waitress drop a tray full of glasses of champagne at a corporate event for {{a delegation of}} international lawyers. To address how a tray could right itself {{at the moment of}} impending tilt, Grieve, a first-time inventor with a university background in 'History of film and photography', developed a finger receiver attached to the bottom of a wait tray based on first-principle physics, load dispersal, and counter movement. In a <b>closed</b> <b>position,</b> the finger receiver lays flush with the bottom of the wait tray so that the tray can sit on the surface of a bar or table without wobbling and can be stacked onto other trays. When the device is open, two slots can be accessed into which a waitperson may secure their two inside fingers, similar to how a flip-flop structurally attaches itself between the toes of the foot to counter the large stresses place upon it. The Safetray product's arrangement creates a strong cantilever advantage for the waitperson to allow them additional control over torque caused by items placed in various locations around the tray. The stability achieved with the Safetray product allows a waitperson to place a bottle of wine right {{at the edge of the}} tray while still keeping the tray in a horizontal position by reacting instinctively against the bottle's off-balance downward force.|$|E
25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their <b>closed</b> <b>position</b> when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|E

50|$|The {{gravity knife}} uses a button, trigger, or fulcrum lever {{to release the}} blade from both the open and the <b>closed</b> <b>positions,</b> and may use a side-folding or {{telescoping}} (out-the-front, or OTF) blade. While most military gravity knives utilize a locking blade design, other types may not mechanically lock open but rely instead upon friction to wedge the rear section of the blade against {{the interior of the}} handle. Factory-made gravity knives have various types of buttons, triggers, and fulcrum levers, which usually are used to release the blade from both the open and the <b>closed</b> <b>positions.</b>|$|R
