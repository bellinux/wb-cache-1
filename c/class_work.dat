5|$|Students must {{finish school}} before turning 21 years old. In 2007, the school's 12-week trimesters were changed into smaller six-week mini-terms, {{and then in}} 2011, even smaller three-week terms {{in order to improve}} {{attendance}}. Students who miss more than three days in a three-week mini-term do not earn full high school credit. As a result of this change, attendance increased by 100%, though daily attendance is still about 50%. It takes 60 hours of <b>class</b> <b>work</b> to earn one credit.|$|E
5|$|The Antankarana were {{historically}} {{fishermen and}} pastoralist zebu herders, although {{in recent years}} most have become agriculturalists. Sea fishing is carried out in two-man canoes made from a single hollowed out log. Antankarana fishermen used these canoes to hunt whales, turtles and fish. They also used nets to hunt in rivers, where they could catch eels, fish, crayfish and other food sources. Salt production was historically a major economic activity. Historically the Antankarana engaged in trading with European seafarers, exchanging tortoiseshell for guns. Today, {{while the majority of}} Antankarana continue to work in these traditional sectors – especially the highly lucrative shrimp fishing business or the growing of sugarcane – many are wage laborers. More highly educated community members, particularly among the noble <b>class,</b> <b>work</b> in salaried positions as government officials, teachers {{and a variety of other}} trades and professions. The SIRAMA national sugar company factories are located in Antankarana territory and employ many migrants, but relatively few Antankarana as their standard of living on average is high enough to be able to pursue better opportunities.|$|E

Capstone courses often conclude with a public presentation from the students on their experiences with the community organization or cause which they explored.|$|E

25|$|At {{the urging}} of his sister, Weston left Chicago {{in the spring of}} 1906 and moved near May's home in Tropico, California (now a {{neighborhood}} in Glendale). He decided to stay there and pursue a career in photography, but he soon realized he needed more professional training. A year later he moved to Effingham, Illinois, in order to enroll in the Illinois College of Photography. They taught a nine-month course, but Weston finished all of the <b>class</b> <b>work</b> in six months. The school refused to give him a diploma unless he paid for the full nine months; Weston refused and instead moved back to California in the spring of 1908.|$|E

Since the mid-1990s, the government may pay a student's tuition in public universities only provided that the instruction is in Latvian.

2500|$|Since then many {{world famous}} authors have praised War and Peace as a {{masterpiece}} of the world literature. Gustave Flaubert expressed his delight in a January 1880 letter to Turgenev, writing: [...] "This is the first <b>class</b> <b>work!</b> What an artist and what a psychologist! The first two volumes are exquisite. I used to utter shrieks of delight while reading. This is powerful, very powerful indeed." [...] Later John Galsworthy called War and Peace [...] "the best novel that had ever been written". Romain Rolland, remembering his reading the novel as a student, wrote: [...] "this work, like life itself, has no beginning, no end. It is life itself in its eternal movement." [...] Thomas Mann thought War and Peace to be [...] "the greatest ever war novel {{in the history of}} literature." [...] Ernest Hemingway confessed that it was from Tolstoy that he'd been taking lessons on how to [...] "write about war in the most straightforward, honest, objective and stark way." [...] "I don't know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy did", Hemingway asserted in his 1955 Men at War. The Best War Stories of All Time anthology.|$|E
2500|$|England {{failed to}} match the Australians' high {{standards}} of fielding and were nicknamed Brown's Cows by the Australian barrackers. They dropped six catches in a match against Victoria and made frequent mistakes in the state matches. However, they made a considerable improvement in the Tests with [...] "...first <b>class</b> <b>work</b> in the field, in direct contrast to the slovenly and often lackadaisical displays in the previous games of the tour". Even so, they never reached the heights of catching and fielding displayed by the Australian team. Both Brown and Alec Bedser weighted 15 stone (over 200 lb or 100 kilos) and were particularly ungainly in the field, but their bucket-like hands picked up 9 catches and Brown twice caught and bowled Keith Miller. Godfrey Evans was the outstanding wicket-keeper of his generation whose enthusiasm could energise a fielding team and always entertained the crowd with his antics. His deputy was Arthur McIntyre, who kept wicket for Alec Bedser, Jim Laker and Tony Lock in the Surrey side that would win the County Championship seven {{times in a row}} in 1952-58. Len Hutton was a good slip and would pick up 9 catches in the series and Trevor Bailey took some great catches in the gully. Unfortunately the MCC had no other slip fielders and they were joined by Gilbert Parkhouse, who hated the role and frequently dropped catches. John Dewes was a good outfielder, {{but the rest of the}} team failed to impress and a picture of John Warr was used to illustrate how not to take catches.|$|E

2500|$|The OLPC {{project has}} also been criticized for {{allegedly}} adopting a [...] "one-shot" [...] deployment approach {{with little or no}} technical support or teacher training, and for neglecting pilot programs and formal assessment of outcomes in favor of quick deployment. Some authors attribute this unconventional approach to the OLPC promoters' alleged focus on constructivist education and 'digital utopianism'. Mark Warschauer, a Professor of University of California at Irvine and Morgan Ames, at the time of writing, a PhD candidate at Stanford University, have pointed out that the laptop by itself does not completely fill the need of students in underprivileged countries. The [...] "children’s machines", as they have been called, have been deployed to several countries, for example Uruguay, Peru, and in the US, Alabama, but after a relatively short time, their usage has declined considerably, sometimes because of hardware problems or breakage, in some cases, as high as 27% to 59% within the first two years, and sometimes {{due to a lack of}} knowledge on the part of the users on how to take full advantage of the machine. However, another factor has recently been acknowledged; a lack of a direct relation to the pedagogy needed in the local context to be truly effective. Uruguay reports that only 21.5% of teachers use the laptop in the classroom on a daily basis, and 25% report using it less than once a week. In Alabama, 80.3% of students say they never or seldom use the computer for <b>class</b> <b>work,</b> and Peru, teachers report that in the first few months, 68.9% use the laptop three times per week, but after two months, only 40% report such usage. Those of a low socio-economic level tend to not be able to effectively use the laptop for educational purposes on their own, but with scaffolding and mentoring from teachers, the machine can become more useful. According to one of the returning OLPC executives, Walter Bender, the approach needs to be more holistic, combining technology with a prolonged community effort, teacher training and local educational efforts and insights.|$|E

That first day passed pleasantly enough in a whirl of excitement, meeting all the new students, learning to know the professors by sight and being assorted and organized into classes. Anne intended taking up the Second Year work being advised to do so by Miss Stacy; Gilbert Blythe elected to do the same. This meant getting a First Class teacher's license in one year instead of two, if they were successful; but it also meant much more and harder work. Jane, Ruby, Josie, Charlie, and Moody Spurgeon, not being troubled with the stirrings of ambition, were content to take up the Second <b>Class</b> <b>work.</b> Anne was conscious of a pang of loneliness when she found herself in a room with fifty other students, not one of whom she knew, except the tall, brown-haired boy across the room; and knowing him in the fashion she did, did not help her much, as she reflected pessimistically. Yet she was undeniably glad that they were in the same class; the old rivalry could still be carried on, and Anne would hardly have known what to do if it had been lacking.|$|E
