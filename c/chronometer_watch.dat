50|$|The similar-sounding terms {{chronograph}} and chronometer {{are often}} confused, although they mean altogether different things. A chronograph is a watch with an added duration timer, often a stopwatch complication (as explained above), while a <b>chronometer</b> <b>watch</b> is a timepiece that has met an industry standard test for performance under pre-defined conditions: a chronometer {{is a high}} quality mechanical or a thermo-compensated movement that has been tested and certified to operate within a certain standard of accuracy by the COSC (Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres). The concepts are different but not mutually exclusive; so a watch can be a chronograph, a chronometer, both, or neither.|$|E
50|$|There is {{no other}} {{physical}} principle determining longitude directly but with time. Longitude at a point may be determined by calculating the time difference between that at its location and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Since there are 24 hours in a day and 360 degrees in a circle, the sun moves across the sky {{at a rate of}} 15 degrees per hour (360° ÷ 24 hours = 15° per hour). So if the time zone a person is in is three hours ahead of UTC then that person is near 45° longitude (3 hours × 15° per hour = 45°). The word near is used because the point might not {{be at the center of}} the time zone; also the time zones are defined politically, so their centers and boundaries often do not lie on meridians at multiples of 15°. In order to perform this calculation, however, a person needs to have a <b>chronometer</b> (<b>watch)</b> set to UTC and needs to determine local time by solar or astronomical observation. The details are more complex than described here: see the articles on Universal Time and on the equation of time for more details.|$|E

These were in themselves strong proofs that the rajah's prahus had been engaged in piratical attacks upon European craft, for they consisted of bales of silk, <b>chronometers,</b> <b>watches,</b> double barreled guns, mirrors, and other articles which had evidently formed a portion of a ship's fittings.|$|R
