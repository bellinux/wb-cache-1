Testing to confirm the diagnosis is typically not needed.|$|E
5|$|No {{attempt to}} arrest Blackburn was made, and he {{returned}} to Kentucky {{with his family in}} early 1873. The family lived in Louisville's Galt House hotel, and Blackburn resumed his medical practice in that city. During a cholera epidemic in 1873, Blackburn rightly theorized that the disease was spread by the consumption of <b>contaminated</b> <b>water,</b> but most citizens accepted the competing theory that cholera was a miasmatic disease. This theory was espoused by Thomas S. Bell, a better-known physician in Louisville. Thousands {{died as a result of}} failing to heed Blackburn's advice to boil potentially <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> before drinking it. Blackburn's philanthropic work included treating victims of yellow fever outbreaks in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1873 and Fernandina, Florida, in 1877. He refused to accept compensation for his services in either city, but was presented with gifts from appreciative residents in both cases. Several southern newspapers also carried glowing accounts of Blackburn's service.|$|E

5|$|Mary {{was born}} on 7 or 8 December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace, Scotland, to King James V and his French second wife, Mary of Guise. She {{was said to have}} been born prematurely and was the only {{legitimate}} child of James to survive him. She was the great-niece of King Henry VIII of England, as her paternal grandmother, Margaret Tudor, was Henry VIII's sister. On 14December, six days after her birth, she became Queen of Scots when her father died, perhaps from the effects of a nervous collapse following the Battle of Solway Moss, or from drinking <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> while on campaign.|$|E
5|$|On October 3, United States President Bill Clinton {{declared}} nine Florida counties as disaster areas, which allocated {{federal funding}} for debris removal, emergency services, and restoration of damaged public facilities. In Franklin County, many residents had to boil water before consumption due to <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> wells. As a result, the local Red Cross chapter provided water bottles to the affected residents. The Red Cross also deployed two Mobile Feeding Vehicles to Wakulla County, {{and a total of}} 700meals were ultimately distributed.|$|E

5|$|The {{flooding}} and mudslides damaged up to 60,000 homes and destroyed 34. Gusty winds caused power outages. River flooding caused two bridges to collapse, isolating several communities. Landslides buried several roads, though authorities quickly repaired them. The rainfall also flooded fields, resulting in severe crop damage. As much as 85% of the banana crop was lost, while the coffee crop suffered losses shortly before harvest season. Crop damage totaled to around $8million (2003USD). In addition, excess flooding <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> supplies, leaving several areas without clean water or sanitation.|$|E
5|$|Toxic {{blue-green algae}} blooms are a {{reasonably}} common occurrence in the lake. Warnings about coming {{into contact with}} the water are released when an algal bloom is detected. Attempts are being made to limit the amount of phosphates entering the lake in the hope of improving its water quality. Blue-green algae (more correctly cyanobacteria) produce toxins, which can be harmful for humans and any other animals that come in contact with the <b>contaminated</b> <b>water.</b> There have been several cases of dogs being affected after playing in and drinking the lake water.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developed}} world Campylobacter jejuni is {{the primary cause of}} bacterial gastroenteritis, with half of these cases associated with exposure to poultry. In children, bacteria are the cause in about 15% of cases, with the most common types being Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter species. If food becomes contaminated with bacteria and remains at room temperature for a period of several hours, the bacteria multiply and increase the risk of infection in those who consume the food. Some foods commonly associated with illness include raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs; raw sprouts; unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses; and fruit and vegetable juices. In the developing world, especially sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, cholera is a common cause of gastroenteritis. This infection is usually transmitted by <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> or food.|$|E

5|$|Transmission {{may occur}} via {{consumption}} of <b>contaminated</b> <b>water,</b> or when people share personal objects. In places with {{wet and dry}} seasons, water quality typically worsens during the wet season, and this correlates with the time of outbreaks. In {{areas of the world}} with four seasons, infections are more common in the winter. Bottle-feeding of babies with improperly sanitized bottles is a significant cause on a global scale. Transmission rates are also related to poor hygiene, especially among children, in crowded households, and in those with pre-existing poor nutritional status. After developing tolerance, adults may carry certain organisms without exhibiting signs or symptoms, and thus act as natural reservoirs of contagion. While some agents (such as Shigella) only occur in primates, others may occur {{in a wide variety of}} animals (such as Giardia).|$|E
5|$|While it {{was first}} intensifying as a {{tropical}} storm, Lupit affected Pohnpei, passing about 120km (75mi) north of Oroluk. Wind gusts peaked at 69km/h (43mph), and the storm dropped 160mm (6.28in) of rainfall. Later, the storm affected Chuuk Atoll in the FSM on November23. Tropical storm force winds were experienced through the state, and rainfall reached 162mm (6.37in) on Chuuk and 195mm (7.68in) on Ulul. The Chuuk state government helped people in low-lying areas to evacuate. High waves flooded homes, and damaged roads and seawalls. About 200houses were damaged or destroyed, and many homes affected by the typhoon had unsanitary conditions, a <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> supply, or lack of food. High winds downed banana and palm trees, and salt water damaged or wrecked all of the food crops in Chuuk.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{was born}} in 1916 in Annandale, an inner suburb of Sydney. However, in his autobiography, {{he claims to have}} been born in 1918 or 1919 in Queensland, and his {{military}} service record has his date of birth as 5 June 1917. He was the third child of Alfred Percival Barnes and Hilda May Barnes (née Jeffery), both from farming families near Tamworth in northern New South Wales. After marrying, the couple left Tamworth to take up a lease on a remote sheep station near Hughenden in North Queensland. Before Sid was born, Alfred died from typhoid fever, caused by drinking <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> on the family property. After his death, Hilda, widowed and pregnant with her latest child, moved to Sydney with her children and stayed with her sister, where Sid was born. From her husband's estate, Hilda Barnes mother was able to purchase and renovate real estate in Stanmore and Leichhardt,New South Wales, to let or sell. Later in life, Barnes would recount how, as a child, he used to collect the rents for his mother.|$|E

5|$|Before Eline struck Mozambique, storm {{warnings}} and later hurricane warnings were issued on February21. Flooding had affected the nation since January, with some areas receiving a year's worth of rainfall in two weeks. Widespread areas were inundated, with about 220,000people displaced, and about 150people killed. Eline moved ashore with very powerful winds, {{although there were}} no direct observations of the strongest winds. In Beira, the closest major city to the landfall point, winds reached storm force. However, the rainfall from Eline was the most impacting following the preexisting flooding, which were the worst since 1951. The floods were beginning to recede by the time Eline arrived, {{and by the end}} of February 2000, the situation was considered the country's worst natural disaster in a century. Flooding continued for days after Eline moved through southern Africa due to waters flowing downstream from neighboring countries. By early March the floods were beginning to recede again, leaving behind a deep layer of mud, ponds of <b>contaminated</b> <b>water,</b> and piles of rotten corpses.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{overflow}} of the Arecibo River on October7, a neighborhood in Utuado {{was cut off}} from surrounding communities after gushing waters severely damaged its main road. Shortly thereafter, a landslide lugged a utility pole along the road, {{making it impossible for}} larger vehicles—including ambulances—to access the site. Landslides trapped fourteen families in the municipality of Ponce; a residence alongside a road suffered significant damage and had to be evacuated. In Cayey, a district was isolated from neighboring areas due to the collapse of a bridge. In the area, burst riverbanks triggered floods across local streets, which trapped dozens of families in their homes. Severe flooding <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> supplies, leaving an estimated 45,000 people without drinking water {{in the wake of the}} storm. In response, the government declared a state of emergency for the entire island. Authorities opened 120 shelters, and several flood victims had to be rescued.|$|E
5|$|Grant was {{temporarily}} disgraced by the surprise attack and near defeat, causing his superior, Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, to assume field {{command of the}} combined armies. Halleck cautiously and slowly approached Beauregard's fortifications at Corinth; his action became derisively called the Siege of Corinth. Beauregard withdrew from Corinth on May 29 to Tupelo, Mississippi. He was able to deceive Halleck into thinking the Confederates were about to attack; he ran empty trains {{back and forth through}} the town while whistles blew and troops cheered as if massive reinforcements were arriving. Beauregard retreated because of the overwhelming Union force and because of <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> supplies in Corinth. In April and May, the Confederates lost almost as many men to death by disease in Corinth as had been killed in battle at Shiloh. Nevertheless, his leaving the critical rail junction at Corinth without a fight was another controversial decision. When Beauregard went on medical leave without requesting permission in advance, President Davis relieved him of command and replaced him with Gen. Braxton Bragg.|$|E

5|$|Heavy rains {{fell over}} Taumalipas, with 348.8mm {{measured}} along the Tamesí River. Widespread flooding forced some 400families to evacuate throughout the state; 70trapped families in El Mante {{had to be}} rescued from their flooded homes. At {{the height of the}} storm, high-voltage electrocutions due to downed power lines caused two deaths in the municipalities of Tampico and Reynosa while critically injuring two workers in Matamoros. By July4, two more deaths were reported in the state, though their causes remain unspecified. Approximately 40,000residents suffered property damage to their homes. A state of emergency was declared in the municipalities of Tampico, Ciudad Madero, Altamira, and González in light of the damage. Broken drains and sewers in the storm's wake increased the risk of cholera through <b>contaminated</b> <b>water.</b> Damage estimates in Tamaulipas exceeded Mex$67million (US$5.8million). In neighboring San Luis Potosí, Arlene dropped 12.18in (309.4mm) of rain and claimed the lives of five people, two due to drownings. Landslides left dozens of communities isolated, and more than 600residents fled from flooded areas, particularly in Ciudad Valles, Tamazunchale, El Naranjo, and Xilitla.|$|E
5|$|Scully learns from {{blood tests}} that the <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> causes rapid {{cellular}} damage and dramatically increases sodium chloride in the body.

The agents both lose consciousness shortly before Navy rescuers arrive at their former ship. Scully comes to at the hospital, where she is told that her written observations on the case helped naval doctors reverse their aging and save Mulder from near-certain death. Scully says {{that she wants to}} return to the Ardent for more research, but the doctor tells her that the ship sank shortly after their rescue due to the flooding.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the gold rush on the Native peoples of the region was considerable. The Tlingit and the Koyukon peoples prospered {{in the short term}} from their work as guides, packers and from selling food and {{supplies}} to the prospectors. In the longer term, however, especially the Hän people living in the Klondike region suffered from the environmental damage of the gold mining on the rivers and forests. Their population had already begun to decline after the discovery of gold along Fortymile River in the 1880s but dropped catastrophically after their move to the reserve, a result of the <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> supply and smallpox. The Hän found only few ways to benefit economically from the gold rush and their fishing and hunting grounds were largely destroyed; by 1904 they needed aid from the NWMP to prevent famine.|$|E
