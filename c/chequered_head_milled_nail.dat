50|$|By 1876, the Iron Works {{occupied}} two sites, {{consisting of}} a rolling <b>mill,</b> a <b>nail</b> <b>mill</b> and a foundry. It had an average annual production of 7,000 tons.|$|R
50|$|In the 17th century, {{iron ore}} was {{discovered}} in Bærum and the ironworks at Bærums Verk were founded. Industries such as paper <b>mills,</b> <b>nail</b> factories, sawmills, glassworks, and brickworks were established along the rivers Lysakerelven and Sandvikselva in the following centuries. There were orchards and other agricultural concerns throughout the area, remnants of which still exist today.|$|R
25|$|Hart and Rochester {{owned and}} {{operated}} numerous businesses during their time in Hagerstown, including a slavery-dependent business, grist <b>mill,</b> <b>nail</b> and rope factory. Nathaniel Rochester was an early trucker taking wagon loads of goods up into New York State, where he located the land he bought that became Rochester. Although the partnership dissolved in 1792, Rochester continued to operate the mill.|$|R

40|$|This {{comparative}} study investigated some physical, milling and cooking properties of four new rice varieties (FARO 44, FARO 52, FARO 60 and FARO 61) in Nigeria. The varieties were processed into white rice and their properties analyzed separately using standard procedures. Results showed that paddy length, paddy-length-to-width-ratio, equivalent diameter, sphericity, grain volume, aspect ratio, thousand paddy grain weight, milled rice length, milled rice width, milled rice length to width ratio, <b>milling</b> recovery, <b>head</b> <b>milled</b> rice, broken milled rice, L*, a*, b*, elongation ratio, cooked-rice-length-to-breadth-ratio, water uptake ratio and cooking time {{were significantly different}} (p< 0. 05) for all the varieties. Milling recovery was found to vary from 65. 3 to 68. 33 %; with FARO 60 having the highest <b>head</b> <b>milled</b> rice. It was observed that FARO 44 had the longest cooking time, elongation ratio and cooked rice length/breadth ratio while FARO 61 {{was found to have}} the highest water uptake ratio. There was significant positive correlation (r = 0. 824) between percentage <b>head</b> <b>milled</b> rice and milling recovery while negative correlation existed between cooking time and L* (r = - 0. 711).

40|$|We {{investigated}} how upland and paddy {{japonica rice}} responded to phosphorous (P) fertilizer under two cultivation methods. The upland rice Zhonghan 3 and the paddy rice Yangfujing 8 were both grown under moist cultivation (MC, control) and bare dry cultivation (DC) with three P levels, low (LP, 45 kg/hm 2), normal (NP, 90 kg/hm 2) and high (HP, 135 kg/hm 2). As P level increased, grain yields of both upland and paddy rice increased under DC. There {{were no significant}} differences in grain yields between HP and NP for either rice, although upland rice slightly increased and paddy rice slightly decreased in grain yield. Under DC at LP, Zhonghan 3 showed a higher <b>head</b> <b>milled</b> rice rate and better appearance, cooking and eating qualities than at HP or NP. Yangfujing 8 was similar to Zhonghan 3 except that Yangfujing 8 had better appearance quality at NP. Under MC, Zhonghan 3 had a higher <b>head</b> <b>milled</b> rice rate at LP and better cooking and eating qualities at NP. Yangfujing 8 was similar to Zhonghan 3 except in appearance quality. DC improved <b>head</b> <b>milled</b> rice rate and appearance quality of both upland and paddy rice, and cooking and nutrient qualities of paddy rice. Compared with paddy rice, upland rice had better processing, nutrient and eating qualities. The results suggest that upland and paddy rice respond differently to cultivation method and phosphorus level...|$|R
