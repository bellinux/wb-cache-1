Many popular {{face recognition}} methods fail to work well in this sce-nario because there are not enough samples for discrim-inant learning. To address this problem, we propose in this paper a novel discriminative multi-manifold analysis (DMMA) method by learning discriminative features from image patches. First, we partition each enrolled image into several non-overlapping patches to form an image set for each sample per person. Then, we formulate the SSPP face recognition as a manifold-manifold matching problem and learn multiple DMMA feature spaces to maximize the man-ifold margins of different persons. Lastly, we propose a reconstruction-based manifold-manifold distance to iden-tify the unlabeled subjects. Experimental results on three widely used face databases are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. 1...|$|E

40|$|Attribute-based {{credentials}} (ABCs) {{are building}} blocks for user-centric identity management. They enable the disclo-sure of a minimum amount of information about their owner to a verifier, typically a service provider, to authorise the credential owner for some service, application, or resource. By directly applying attribute-disclosure protocols, the data is revealed {{not only to the}} verifier, but anyone who has access to the communication channel. Moreover, as ver-ifiers are not intrinsically authenticated, one can accidentally reveal attributes to the wrong party. Therefore, a secure channel has to be established between the prover and the verifier. Although efficient ABC smart-card implementations exist, not always can they perform all prover features. An equality proof, for instance, is essential in creating pseudonyms that enable temporary identification and eventually establishing a channel. Without this feature, other techniques have to be developed. In this paper we apply a more general notion of authentication that does not require <b>card</b> <b>identification</b> or pseudonyms. Based on this concept, we propose a secu-rity model that includes mutual authentication and setting up a channel between a card and a verifier. We present two efficient and provably secure protocols under standard assumptions in the random oracle model...|$|E

We compared direct identification by the AMS-GPI Card with the final AMS-GPI <b>Card</b> <b>identification</b> and with our standard identification methods. We evaluated 51 gram-positive organisms from clinical blood cultures as well as 49 simulated blood cultures. The isolates included Streptococcus pneumoniae (17), Streptococcus pyogenes (13), group D enterococci (12), Streptococcus agalactiae (11), viridans streptococci (10), coagulase-negative staphylococci (21), Staphylococcus aureus (15), and Listeria monocytogenes (1). The AMS-GPI Card identified all of the group D enterococci, viridans streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci and all but one each of the Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae isolates. L. monocytogenes was also correctly identified. However, the AMS-GPI Card identified only 12 of 17 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 9 of 15 Staphylococcus aureus isolates by direct inoculation. We therefore conclude that the results of direct identification of gram-positive organisms by the AMS-GPI Card may be used cautiously for rapid direct identification of gram-positive organisms from positive blood cultures...|$|E
