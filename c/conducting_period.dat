40|$|The {{phase control}} {{characteristics}} in a thyristor phase control circuit with parallel resonance elements indicate very interesting phenomenon. Several extreme values {{appear on the}} phase control curve. The phenomenon {{is different from the}} step-up one in a thyristor phase control circuit with series RLC elements which is interpreted as series resonance. To comprehend the circuit performance with those loads, it is necessary that the phenomenon on extreme value is physically clarified from other viewpoints. In this paper the performance in this circuit is studied from two viewpoints of a natural oscillation and a parallel resonance. Then, it is found that the performance depends on a natural frequency in thyristor <b>conducting</b> <b>period</b> and a parallel resonance frequency in thyristor non-conducting period. Therefore, the interesting phenomenon on extreme value is affected by the alternative of natural frequency or parallel resonance frequency...|$|E

50|$|There were a {{several reasons}} why the {{government}} had promoted “assimilation immigration” and established the immigration village for Japanese. First and the primary aim was to adjust the surplus population, in order to solve the limited farming resources in Japan; Secondly, to consolidate Japanese domination, for assimilation {{and the purpose of}} national defence; Lastly, develop preparation for Japan moving into tropical areas.The immigration was divided into four major periods. The initial privately <b>conduct</b> immigration <b>period</b> in 1895-1908, where the first immigrant village was established; The publicly <b>conduct</b> <b>period</b> by the Karenkō Prefecture in 1909-1917, which introduced around 1700 immigrants into Eastern Taiwan; The privately <b>conduct</b> <b>period</b> by Taitō Prefecture in 1917-1932, where the immigrants mainly settled in Taitung (台東); The later publicly <b>conduct</b> immigration <b>period</b> in 1932-1945, had its development based in Western Taiwan. When the Japanese colonial rule ended in October 1945, all the Japanese immigrants were sent back to Japan with limitation on the sources they could bring home. For example, one set of winter and summer clothing, one blanket and cash no more than 1000 Yen.|$|R

40|$|The {{first ever}} testing {{of a full}} size solar dynamic heat {{receiver}} using high temperature thermal energy storage was completed. The heat receiver was {{designed to meet the}} requirements for operation on the Space Station Freedom. The purpose of the test program was to quantify the receiver thermodynamic performance, its operating temperatures, and thermal response to changes in environmental and power module interface boundary conditions. The heat receiver was tested in a vacuum chamber with liquid nitrogen cold shrouds and an aperture cold plate to partially simulate a low Earth orbit environment. The cavity of the receiver was heated by an infrared quartz lamp heater with 30 independently controllable zones to produce flux distributions typical of candidate concentrators. A closed Brayton cycle engine simulator conditioned a helium xenon gas mixture to specific interface conditions to simulate various operational modes of the solar dynamic power module. Inlet gas temperature, pressure, and flow rate were independently varied. A total of 58 simulated orbital cycles were completed during the test <b>conduct</b> <b>period.</b> The test hardware, execution of testing, test data, and post test inspections are described...|$|R
