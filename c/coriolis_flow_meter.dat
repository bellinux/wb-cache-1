50|$|If {{the density}} changes too often for manual {{calibration}} to be sufficient, the <b>coriolis</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> {{can be adapted}} to measure the density as well. The natural vibration frequency of the flow tubes depend on the combined mass of the tube and the fluid contained in it. By setting the tube in motion and measuring the natural frequency, the mass of the fluid contained in the tube can be deduced. Dividing the mass on the known volume of the tube gives us the density of the fluid.|$|E
50|$|The density at {{all points}} of a {{homogeneous}} object equals its total mass divided by its total volume. The mass is normally {{measured with a}} scale or balance; the volume may be measured directly (from the geometry of the object) or by the displacement of a fluid. To determine the density of a liquid or a gas, a hydrometer, a dasymeter or a <b>Coriolis</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> may be used, respectively. Similarly, hydrostatic weighing uses the displacement of water due to a submerged object to determine {{the density of the}} object.|$|E
30|$|The surface {{equipment}} for monitoring surface parameters {{consists of a}} <b>Coriolis</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> pressure transducer, P 2, a flow in the choke manifold, and a conductivity sensor. A pressure transducer (P 2) located downstream of the pressure cell and upstream of the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> as shown in Fig.  1 b, is {{used to measure the}} pressure in the return mud entering the surface monitoring equipment. The <b>Coriolis</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> is equipped with Elite flow sensor to provide good measurement sensitivity and stability when measuring multi-phase flow and it has tolerance for drill cuttings. The <b>Coriolis</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> is installed such that the tube is in the up orientation or flag up position to allow an effective drainage of cuttings and mud from the sensor. The choke manifold consists of three valves: a pressure relief valve installed on the pressure relief loop (line), a needle (or backpressure) valve to adjust backpressure in the downhole pressure in the pressure cell and a manual pressure control valve. In the event of a surge in the pressure cell, a pressure relief valve (PRV), installed upstream of the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> diverts flow to the pressure relief (bypass) line. The pressure control and needle valves are mainly used to control the downhole pressure. The conductivity sensor measures the electrolytic conductivity changes in the drilling mud return; however, was not monitored t due the sensor’s incompatibility with drill cuttings.|$|E

The idea of technical solution for de-termining fluid viscosity by <b>Coriolis</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> and Hagen-Poiseuille equation was elaborated. Pressure drop was {{measured at the}} Coriolis tube instead of at the straight pipeline section. The {{aim of the research}} is to consider the possibility of applying the proposed technical solution for reliable determination of water viscosity. It was proved that by taking into account the temperature of water t and hydraulic parameters of measurement system Δp/Q, the proposed technical solution can be a reliable method for continuous monitoring of water viscosity, even if Hagen-Poiseuille flow was not achieved. The proposed solution decreases the number of necessary sensors for viscosity measuring, and makes the system and facility more compact. Compared to the conventional parallel mounted capillary viscometer with constant flow pump, the proposed technical solution is much cheaper.

40|$|Abstract − The weight vector {{theory for}} <b>Coriolis</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> {{has been the}} subject of {{research}} presented by Hemp and co-workers in various articles. The underlying theory may not be easily understood. This paper explains the application of the weight vector theory for Coriolis flowmeters. The theory is applied to simple theoretical meter configurations consisting of a single straight pipe. The application of the weight vector approach is of relevance when investigating velocity profile effects, e. g., in <b>Coriolis</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters.</b> Promising results have been found in recent literature showing the vulnerability of straight pipe Coriolis flowmeter configurations to velocity profile effects. The application of the weight vector theory is shown to be either limited to the investigation of few parameters or employs unrealistic boundary conditions and lacks comparative studies, making a more comprehensive study desirable. The usefulness of the weight vector theory to predict velocity profile effects for bended tube is not apparent from today’s state-of-the-art literature, but of great interest for flowmeter manufacturers since bended tubes designs are frequently used in today’s Coriolis flowmeters...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThere is no {{reliable}} measurement method of {{air-to-air heat pump}} seasonal performances. In this paper, we tested a method based on intrusive measurements on the refrigerant side. The method proposed uses two Coriolis mass flow meters for the measurement of the refrigerant flow rate and of the vapor quality at the indoor heat exchanger outlet. The method is validated by testing an air-to-water heat pump in laboratory conditions and by using the water enthalpy method as a reference. Results confirm that the refrigerant density measurement with a <b>Coriolis</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> can help to predict the refrigerant vapor quality with satisfactory accuracy if the quality is not too high.

30|$|Additionally to the {{uncertain}} behavior of drilling fluid under extremely high temperatures, {{one of the}} main problems during drilling exploration wells is uncertainties related to pore and fracture pressures and potential over-pressurized zones. This problem was resolved in the Venelle- 2 campaign by Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) system with a rotating circulation device (RDC) and Coriolis’s flow meter, which is mostly used in depleted oil and gas reservoirs with severe circulation losses (Bertani et al. 2018). MPD systems allow maintaining well pressures slightly higher than the pore pressure, which might be a potential solution for maintaining constant downhole pressures in high-enthalpy geothermal boreholes, preventing differential sticking and allowing for much safer and more efficient drilling in severe circulation loss zones. Unfortunately, MPD systems cannot guarantee well control but rather, enable to provide constant monitoring of bottom hole pressures and flow rates. This helps to evaluate in a real-time variation of downhole conditions and keep the downhole pressure balance within a certain range. Installed <b>Coriolis</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> is able to detect any difference between flow in and out, whereas through RCD choke valves are controlled and surface back pressure is being regulated.|$|E

40|$|International audienceHeat pump {{systems have}} become very popular for space heating in the {{residential}} sector in Europe. However, there is no data available on the in situ seasonal heating performances of air-to-air heat pumps. This {{is due to the}} difficulty of measuring their thermal capacity on field over a long period. Several methods relying on air flow rate and enthalpy measurements are being considered for in-situ measurement for air-to-air heat pumps. But accuracy and reliability of these methods are still unknown. In this paper, we show the results of a method based on intrusive measurements (on the refrigerant side) adapted to the dynamic behavior. This method uses Coriolis flow meters measures for the refrigerant flow rate and for enthalpies. Results confirm that the refrigerant density measurement with a <b>Coriolis</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> can help to predict the refrigerant vapor quality with a satisfying accuracy if the quality is not too high. The method is validated by testing an air-to-water heat pump in laboratory and by using the water enthalpy method as a reference.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the design and}} construction of an automatic drilling fluid measurement setup {{and the use of}} such setup to control the drilling fluid pH. The construction of the experimental setup include modifications to the acquired rheometer to obtain reliable batch rheology measurements within the typical viscosity range of a shear-thinning drilling fluid ([0. 02 - 0. 15]Pas). A model-based control approach is taken to control the drilling fluid pH. With help of a static model we have defined a new scaling method which enables us to get an estimate of the required control fluid to shift the pH up to a mud volume of 32 L. Implementation of the model shows that the pH can be maintained within the desired operating window if the quantity of control fluid is adjusted properly. The right quantity of control fluid is achieved by adjusting the estimated quantity of control fluid with help of a tuning parameter a. Results of this thesis show that to be able to control the pH at rig-scale, which is a dynamic process, closed-loop pH control based on the flux {{in and out of the}} mud tank should be implemented. The closed-loop pH control utilizes two pH sensors, the new scaling method and the signal from the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> to add the right quantity of control fluid to stabilize the pH of the drilling fluid into the well. Based on the results that show the advantages of measuring both incoming and outgoing fluid properties at the active mud tank, a twin skid construction for rig-scale implementation is proposed. ?Petroleum EngineeringGeoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{described}} the use of <b>Coriolis</b> mass <b>flow</b> <b>metering</b> for multiphase <b>flows,</b> with applications in {{the oil and gas}} industry.

Formal trials took place at the UK National Flow Laboratory. A single synthetic oil was used; its viscosity was adjusted by controlling temperature. The results show that Coriolis metering is well suited to high viscosity oil/gas mixtures: in the formalized trials, mass flow errors for gas were mostly within 5 % and for liquid were mostly within 2. 5 %. Achieving this accuracy up to 90 % GVF represents an advance on previous work, which has been limited to around 50 % GVF for low viscosity oils in two-phase and three-phase mixtures...|$|R
40|$|The Coriolis {{principle}} for measuring flow rates has great advantages {{compared to other}} flow measurement principles, the most important being that mass flow is measured directly.

5000|$|The {{flow rate}} of {{supercritical}} carbon dioxide should be {{measured in terms of}} mass flow rather than by volume because the density of the [...] changes according to the temperature both before entering the pump heads and during compression. <b>Coriolis</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> are best used to achieve such flow confirmation. To maximize the rate of extraction, the flow rate should be high enough for the extraction to be completely diffusion limited (but this will be very wasteful of solvent). However, to minimize the amount of solvent used, the extraction should be completely solubility limited (which will take a very long time). Flow rate must therefore be determined depending on the competing factors of time and solvent costs, and also capital costs of pumps, heaters and heat exchangers. The optimum flow rate will probably be somewhere in the region where both solubility and diffusion are significant factors.|$|R

40|$|Most {{two-phase}} {{applications for}} <b>Coriolis</b> mass <b>flow</b> <b>metering</b> are for low Gas Void Fraction (GVF) conditions, i. e. where the process fluid is essentially liquid with relatively {{low levels of}} entrained air or gas. There are particular challenges associated with metering wet gas, where the GVF exceeds 95 %. Established wet gas metering techniques are typically based on a differential pressure-type device (for example an orifice plate or V-cone). It is well-known that such devices over-read compared to a dry gas calibration; equations to correct the reading are available if the degree of gas "wetness" is known. For <b>Coriolis</b> mass <b>flow</b> <b>metering</b> of wet gas, two approaches are described. The natural extension of the low GVF techniques is to map the observed mass flow and density readings onto estimates of the flow rates of the gas and liquid components.
