40|$|The minimum {{possible}} soil tillage is {{an important}} part of a sustainable crop production system. Research and practice of reduced tillage was originally started mainly to reduce energy and time consumption related to tillage. However, current research and practice of reduced tillage is also aimed at soil and water conservation as well as reduction of nutrient losses from arable land. Research on reduced tillage in Sweden has been conducted for more than two decades. Reduced tillage comprises different tillage systems, which replace the traditional moldboard ploughing. These also include modem plough shares by which depth of ploughing can be reduced to about 10 cm. This report summarizes investigations of soil physical properties in six long-term experiments with reduced tillage. The experiments were 6 to 24 years old at the time of investigation (in 1997 or 1998). In this study, soil physical properties after minimum tillage and <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing</b> were compared. Soil physical properties investigated include dry bulk density, soil water content during the vegetation period, infiltration, saturated hydraulic conductivity, water holding capacity, air permeability in the field and laboratory, oxygen content of soil air after continuous or heavy rain, and soil temperature. Soil water content during the vegetation period was measured with TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry). The dry bulk density in the lower part of the top soil was greater in plots with reduced tillage than in plots with <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing.</b> Many of the investigated soil physical properties were improved by reduced tillage. Variation of soil water content was smaller for reduced tillage than for <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing.</b> This shows that drainage and water holding capacity often were improved, particularly in the heavy soils. crop yield in heavy clays has been improved by reduced tillage. In some cases, A decrease in yield was observed during the initial periods of reduced tillage, but the difference has been minimized with time, which can be attributed to the improvement of soil structure. This improvement, however, may be less pronounced in light soils. A well planned transition from <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing</b> to reduced tillage, such as loosening of old plough pan and minimizing of infestation by perennial weeds, can minimize yield losses...|$|E
40|$|In {{the autumn}} 2006 a project was {{started with the}} title "Soil {{structure}} for Optimal Winter Oilseed Rape". In this essay eight field trials in the southern and middle part of Sweden have been studied between the years of 2006 and 2007. Six of the field trials (R 2 - 4141 and L 2 - 4141) contained different establish methods. The establish methods that were investigated for winter oilseed rape were <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing,</b> shallow ploughing, shallow cultivation with a Carrier or a cultivator, spread sowing followed by cultivation with a Carrier or a cultivator and sub soiling. The other two field trials (R 2 - 4135 and R 2 - 4135 - 6) show how winter oilseed rape reacts on different preceding crops (spring barley, winter wheat, fallow and active fallow) and establish methods (<b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing</b> and shallow cultivation). To investigate the soil structure and how it affects {{the development of the}} plant, different measurements were made. Some of these were seed bed analysis, water infiltration, soil penetration, plant counting and studying plant development in autumn and spring. The establishment trials were situated in different parts of Sweden, which made an overall comparison difficult. The results of the measurements varied between the trials, but were small within the trials. The differences in yield were small. There were some tendency that a reduced cultivation system resulted in a higher yield on heavy soil and the opposite on light soil. Winter oilseed rape established well in a reduced cultivation system. The crop yield in a reduced cultivation system was in many cases higher than after <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing.</b> Even the easy and cheap cultivation systems as broadcasted seeding followed by cultivation with a Carrier or a cultivator resulted in good crop yields. The combination of cheap establishment and high yields has in many cases resulted in the best economy. In the experiments with different preceding crops, located outside Uppsala, there were more significant results between the different treatments. In the seedbed analysis there were more small aggregates in the seedbed in a reduced cultivation system. The preceding crop also seemed to {{have an effect on the}} aggregate size, with smallest aggregates after winter wheat as a preceding crop, followed by spring barley, fallow and active fallow. The penetration resistance was less after <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing</b> then after shallow cultivation with a Carrier in the surface soil.

In late autumn, the plants were bigger after winter wheat as a preceding crop than after spring barley, although in the spring the difference was not that clear even if the tendency was the same.

This study investigates measures to reduce nitrate losses from tillage land used for spring barley production to a shallow {{sand and gravel}} aquifer situated in Oak Park, Co. Carlow, south-east Ireland, in an area with high groundwater vulnerability and close proximity to a nearby river. The hydrogeological investigations and the charaterisation of aquifer under the study area were performed. Particle size analysis confirmed the sand and gravel dominated composition of these sediments. Aquifer transmissivity was estimated {{in the range from}} c. 248 - 1058 m 2 /day. A tracer study indicated that soil surface activities at this site can have an impact on shallow groundwater quality within a period of less than one year. The effects of the three over-winter green cover treatments (mustard, natural regeneration and no-cover) under two different tillage practices (<b>conventional</b> <b>plough</b> and reduced tillage) on nitrate leaching to the unsaturated zone were examined over the period of over-wintering leaching seasons during the three years.

Due to the regular contact with farmers, advisers, developers and scientists knowledge of practice will be carried into scientific research, the transfer of knowledge will be carried on.

40|$|Planting basins and ripper tillage {{practices}} are major {{components of the}} recently introduced conservation agriculture package that is being extensively promoted for smallholder farming in Zimbabwe. Besides preparing land for crop planting, these two technologies also help in collecting and using rainwater more efficiently in semi-arid areas. The basin tillage is being targeted for households with limited or no access to draught animals while ripping is meant for smallholder farmers with some draught animal power. Trials were established at four farms in Gwanda and Insiza in southern Zimbabwe to determine soil water contributions and runoff water losses from plots under four different tillage treatments. The tillage treatments were hand-dug planting basins, ripping, conventional spring and double ploughing using animal-drawn implements. The initial intention was to measure soil water changes and runoff losses from cropped plots under the four {{tillage practices}}. However, due to total crop failure, only soil water and runoff were measured from bare plots between December 2006 and April 2007. Runoff losses were highest under <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing.</b> Planting basins retained most of the rainwater that fell during each rainfall event. The amount of rainfall received at each farm significantly influenced the volume of runoff water measured. Runoff water volume increased with increase {{in the amount of}} rainfall received at each farm. Soil water content was consistently higher under basin tillage than the other three tillage treatments. Significant differences in soil water content were observed across the farms according to soil types from sand to loamy sand. The basin tillage method gives a better control of water losses from the farmers’ fields. The planting basin tillage method has a greater potential for providing soil water to crops than ripper, double and single <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing</b> practice...|$|E

Smallholders practicing CA have resorted to using grass and leaf litter in addition to available crop residues. The effect of these different mulching materials on maize (Zea mays L.) growth and yield is not well documented in smallholder CA systems of southern Africa. A two-year experiment was run in 2012 / 13 and 2013 / 14 seasons to evaluate the effect of maize residues, grass (Hyparrhenia filipendula (L.) Stapf.) and leaf litter that farmers are currently using and residues from leguminous species, sunhemp (Crotolaria juncea L.) and Tephrosia (Tephrosia vogelii ((Hook) f.)) on maize nitrogen (N) uptake, growth and yield. Significant differences in soil water content across treatments were only observed during March in 2012 / 13 season. Maize residues retained more soil water and Tephrosia had the lowest soil water content when seasonal rainfall pattern was erratic.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of cover crops and non-inversion tillage regimes at minimising farm-scale nutrient losses were assessed across a large, commercial arable farm in Norfolk, UK. The trial area, covering 143 ha, was split into three blocks: winter fallow with mouldboard ploughing (Block J); shallow non-inversion tillage with a winter oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus) cover crop (Block P); and direct drilling with a winter oilseed radish cover crop (Block L). Soil, water and vegetation chemistry across the trial area were monitored over the 2012 / 13 (pre-trial), 2013 / 14 (cover crops and non-inversion tillage) and 2014 / 15 (non-inversion tillage only) farm years. Results revealed oilseed radish reduced nitrate (NO 3 ¬¬-N) leaching losses in soil water by 75 – 97 % {{relative to the}} fallow block, but had no impact upon phosphorus (P) losses. Corresponding reductions in riverine NO 3 ¬¬-N concentrations were not observed, despite the trial area covering 20 % of the catchment. Mean soil NO 3 ¬¬-N concentrations were reduced by ~ 77 % at 60 – 90 cm depth beneath the cover crop, highlighting the ability of deep rooting oilseed radish to scavenge nutrients from deep within the soil profile. Alone, direct drilling and shallow non-inversion tillage were ineffective at reducing soil water NO 3 ¬¬-N and P concentrations relative to <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing.</b> Applying starter fertiliser to the cover crop increased radish biomass and nitrogen (N) uptake, but resulted in net N accumulation within the soil.

An experiment was established in 1991 by liming and fertilizing at two levels an area of native vegetation (NV). The treatments, replicated in randomized plots, included pastures, continuous cropping and ICL systems under PT or NT.

The high C:N ratios suggested that there was a high proportion of charcoal present in the soil. Increasing fertilizer inputs had no overall significant effect on SOC stocks. Stocks of SOC changed little under pastures. Analyses of ¹³C abundance showed that higher fertilizer inputs increased the decomposition rate of C derived from NV under pure grass pastures. Continuous cropping under NT preserved SOC and under PT there were significant losses. The highest SOC stocks were found under ILP treatments, but not all ILP treatments accumulated SOC even under NT.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in crop establishment techniques {{have led to}} the introduction of conservation tillage systems that enables a {{reduction in the number of}} field operations and associated costs whilst maintaining or increasing financial margins. A recent development in conservation tillage systems in the United States was the adoption of strip tillage that was defined as the disturbance of less than one-third of a total field by cultivation. The aim of strip tillage is to produce a narrow, residue free, cultivated zone that is suitable for drilling crops into whilst leaving a significant area uncultivated that maintains crop residue on the soil surface with benefits both to soil stability and biodiversity. This study reported in this thesis focuses on the use ofa strip tillage implement to establish Brassica napus and Beta vulgaris in two soil types found in the United Kingdom. Crop residue has been reported to reduce crop emergence and this study found a reduction in percentage emergence by up to 40 % when straw was mixed into the top 5 cm of soil or when straw and seed was placed on the soil surface. The strip tillage unit using a tine and disc combination operating in a range of light soil types gave disturbance patterns that were independent of forward speed in the range of 6. 0 to 12. 0 km/h but tine penetration was often limited. The star wheel was found to remove up to 80 % of straw residue from within row. Using strip tillage was found to create a tilth either similar to, or finer than, plough tillage but initially gave poorer emergence and growth. Overall performance of using strip tillage to establish Brassica napus and Beta vulgaris was found to be equivalent to a <b>conventional</b> <b>plough</b> tillage system resulting in no penalties to crop yield or quality.

40|$|During 2007 – 2011 we {{assessed}} content {{and quality of}} humic substances with relationship to soil structure. Object of study was Haplic Chernozem (Hrušovany nad Jevišovkou, Czech Republic) under three different tillage systems: – <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing</b> {{to a depth of}} 0. 22 m (CP); – reduced tillage with shallow harrowing to a depth of 0. 15 m (RTSH); – reduced tillage with subsoiling to a depth of 0. 35 – 0. 40 m (RTS). Isolation of humic acids was made according to IHSS standard method using spectrometer Shimadzu 8700. Aggregates stability was determined by wet sieving method. Results showed that macrostructure stability was directly connected with time of sampling and content and quality of humic substances. After five years of experiment statistically significant differences in humic substances content were found. The highest structure stability, quantity and quality of humic substances were achieved under reduced tillage with shallow harrowing...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{farmers are}} {{interested}} in adopting conservation tillage to preserve soil quality and fertility and to prevent soil erosion. Within {{the framework of a}} French national study, we compared <b>conventional</b> (<b>ploughing)</b> and conservation tillage systems in organic farming for arable and vegetable cropping systems. Field experiments and on-farm surveys were conducted in several regions of France in order to assess the effects of different tillage systems on soil fertility (physical, chemical, biological) and on weed and crop development. Conservation tillage techniques induced a more compact soil, an increase of carbon and microorganisms in the first soil layer, and an increase of earthworm biomass for very superficial tillage. Weed control was only a major problem for the very superficial tillage, which in turn generated lower crop yields than conventional tillage. The main issues raised by this programme deal with the long-term effects of these techniques on soil fertility, and the improvement of conservation tillage techniques in organic farming...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The paper {{presents}} {{the influence of}} the <b>conventional</b> <b>ploughing</b> tillage technology in comparison with the minimum tillage, upon the soil properties, weed control and yield in the case of maize (Zea mays L.), soya-bean (Glycine hispida L.) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in a three years crop rotation. A research has been conducted at the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Cluj-Napoca, Romania. The use of minimum soil tillage systems within a three years rotation: maize, soya-bean, wheat favorites the rise of the aggregates hydro stability with 5. 6 - 7. 5 % on a 0 - 20 cm depth and 5 - 11 % on 20 - 30 cm depth. The minimum soil tillage systems – paraplow, chisel or rotary grape – are polyvalent alternatives for basic preparation, germination bed preparation and sowing, for fields and crops with moderate loose requirements being optimized technologies for: soil natural fertility activation and rationalization, reduction of erosion, increasing th...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNo-tillage (NT) with residue {{retention}} {{is often}} suggested {{as an option}} to adapt cropping systems to drier conditions because yield in rain fed systems could benefit from increased soil water. But under wetter conditions, NT may lower yields, depending on soil and crop characteristics. In a future climate, inter-annual variability in wet and dry conditions is projected to increase in central Europe, in spite of drier mean conditions. Thus, long-term benefits of NT for yield stability remain uncertain. We addressed this question by analyzing the variability of absolute and relative yield {{in relation to the}} atmospheric water balance (P-ET 0) using data from a long-term experiment near Bern (Switzerland) comparing NT and <b>conventional</b> <b>plough</b> tillage (CT) on slightly humic sandy loam soil. There {{was no significant difference between}} CT and NT in mean yield for any of the crops, but for peas and beans, c. v. (%) was clearly higher under CT. In contrast, differences in c. v. between CT and NT for winter barley, winter wheat and maize were marginal. Relative yield (Yrel=YNT/YCT) varied across years for all crops. For peas, beans and winter wheat Yrel varied in relation to P-ET 0 during the period March to May. For peas and bean, Yrel was > 1 when P-ET 0 was negative, but showed no trend when positive, thus indicating yield improvements under NT after drier springs. In contrast, Yrel for winter wheat increased with increasing P-ET 0 indicating positive effects of NT under wetter springtime conditions. During the duration of the experiment (1994 - 2013), inter-annual variability of P-ET 0 for March-May was larger than during periods of equal length since 1900. Thus, in a future climate with more variable springtime conditions, the yield-effect of NT for each crop may be negative, positive or neutral, and in the long run NT appears to have only a marginal adaptation potential...|$|R
40|$|Human action upon soil by tillage determines {{important}} morphological, physical-chemical {{and biological}} changes, with different intensities and evaluative directions. Nowadays, it is internationally accepted {{the fact that}} global climatic changes are the results of human intervention in the bio-geo-chemical water and material cycle, and the sequestration of carbon in soil is considered an important intervention to limit these changes. Carbon sequestration in soil is net advantageous, improving the productivity and sustainability. The more the organic content in soil is higher the better soil aggregation is. The soil without organic content is compact. This reduces its capacity to infiltrate water, nutrients solubility and productivity, and that way it reduces the soil capacity for carbon sequestration. Organic matter is an extremely important constituent of soils and is vital {{to many of the}} hydrological, biological and chemical reactions required for sustaining plant life. We present the influence of <b>conventional</b> <b>plough</b> tillage system on soil, water and organic matter conservation in comparison with an alternative minimum tillage system (paraplow, chisel plow and rotary harrow). The application of minimum tillage systems increased the organic matter content 0. 8 % to 22. 1 % and water stabile aggregate content from 1. 3 % to 13. 6 %, in the 0 - 30 cm depth, as compared to the classical system. For the organic matter content and the wet aggregate stability, the statistical analysis of the data showed, increasing positive significance of minimum systems. While the soil fertility and the wet aggregate stability were initially low, the effect of conservation practices on the soil features resulted in a positive impact on the water permeability of the soil. Availability of soil moisture during the crop growth resulted in better plant water status. Subsequent release of conserved soil water regulated proper plant water status, soil structure, and lowered soil pene-trometer resistance. </p...|$|R
40|$|Runoff, sediment, total {{phosphorus}} and total dissolved phosphorus losses in overland flow were measured {{for two years}} on unbounded plots cropped with wheat and oats. Half of the field was cultivated with minimum tillage (shallow tillage with a tine cultivator) and half was conventionally ploughed. Within each cultivation treatment there were different treatment areas (TA). In {{the first year of}} the experiment, one TA was cultivated up and down the slope, one TA was cultivated on the contour, with a beetle bank acting as a vegetative barrier partway up the slope, and one had a mixed direction cultivation treatment, with cultivation and drilling conducted up and down the slope and all subsequent operations conducted on the contour. In the second year, this mixed treatment was replaced with contour cultivation. Results showed no significant reduction in runoff, sediment losses or {{total phosphorus}} losses from minimum tillage when compared to the <b>conventional</b> <b>plough</b> treatment, but there were increased losses of total dissolved phosphorus with minimum tillage. The mixed direction cultivation treatment increased surface runoff and losses of sediment and phosphorus. Increasing surface roughness with contour cultivation reduced surface runoff compared to up and down slope cultivation in both the plough and minimum tillage treatment areas, but this trend was not significant. Sediment and phosphorus losses in the contour cultivation treatment followed a very similar pattern to runoff. Combining contour cultivation with a vegetative barrier in the form of a beetle bank to reduce slope length resulted in a non-significant reduction in surface runoff, sediment and total phosphorus when compared to up and down-slope cultivation, but there was a clear trend towards reduced losses. However, the addition of a beetle bank did not provide a significant reduction in runoff, sediment losses or total phosphorus losses when compared to contour cultivation, suggesting only a marginal additional benefit. The economic implications for farmers of the different treatment options are investigated in order to assess their suitability for implementation at a field scale...|$|R
