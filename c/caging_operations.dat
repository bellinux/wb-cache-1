40|$|Voter caging is a {{term that}} drew public {{attention}} {{as a result of}} testimony provided by Monica Goodling, former White House liaison to the Department of Justice, to a 2007 House Judiciary Committee hearing on the firings of eight US Attorneys. Although public interest in voter caging is relatively recent, the practice is not new. Republicans have engaged in voter caging on the national and state level since the late 1950 's. According to many election observers, voter caging is a controversial political tactic that typically targets minority voters to directly disenfranchise them or suppress their vote by intimidation. Republican officials, on the other hand, maintain that voter caging is part of what they describe as "ballot security" measures necessary to combat voter fraud. The following report reviews Republican voter <b>caging</b> <b>operations</b> during the last 50 years, culminating with the unprecedented number of large voter <b>caging</b> <b>operations</b> conducted across the nation in the 2004 presidential election.

40|$|Praziquantel {{is a broad}} {{spectrum}} anthelmintic drug {{that has been used}} therapeutically in humans and other animals for over 30 years. The efficacy of praziquantel against polyopisthocotylean and monopisthocotylean monogenean flukes in fish using bath treatments has been well demonstrated, however such treatments are prohibitively expensive for sea <b>cage</b> <b>operations.</b> In-feed treatments are also effective, however praziquantel is very bitter and its inclusion into fish diets has a negative impact on food intake and therefore effective dosing. This study aimed to investigate several innovative approaches to improve the palatability of feed containing praziquantel for commercially cultured yellowtail kingfish. The study revealed that freshly applying garlic extract to the surface of pellets coated with praziquantel was highly effective at increasing palatability. Incorporation of praziquantel into mash feeds before pellet extrusion, incorporation of praziquantel into hydrogenated castor oil solid lipid nanoparticles and the use of transglutaminase to strengthen the gelatin binder all proved ineffective at increasing palatability. When the garlic extract was applied 5 days prior to feeding the diets, palatability was reduced. Fish fed diets freshly coated with garlic extract consumed 100 % of the ration at a praziquantel dietary inclusion level of 5 g/kg. As the praziquantel inclusion level increased to 15 g/kg the consumption reduced slightly, but not significantly. The time taken to consume the ration was significantly slower in diets containing praziquantel and garlic extract coating compared to diets without praziquantel, regardless of praziquantel dietary inclusion level. This study focused on juvenile kingfish less than 350 grams. Future research should revolve around larger kingfish, testing lower concentrations of garlic extract and testing efficacy of the actual treatment in fish infested with flukes. The findings have considerable potential to increase the efficiency of application of praziquantel to yellowtail kingfish and potentially other cultured finfish...|$|R

40|$|The {{interactions}} between cage culture and wild fishery activities in three Indonesian reservoirs, Saguling, Cirata and Jatiluhur, {{of the greater}} Ciratum watershed, West Java, were evaluated using historical data and interviews with cage culture operators. In all three reservoirs, cage culture of common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., and later of common carp and Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (L.), were encouraged as an alternative livelihood for persons displaced by the impoundment. Currently, a two-net culture system, locally known as 2 ̆ 7 lapis dua 2 ̆ 7, in which in the inner cage (7 × 7 × 3 m) is used for common carp culture and the outer cage (7 × 7 × 5 / 7 m) is stocked with Nile tilapia, is practised. On average each cage is stocked with  approximately 100 kg fingerlings each of common carp and Nile tilapia. The numbers of cages and production of cultured fish has increased in the reservoirs, but total and per cage production began to decline from about 1995 in Saguling from 2200 kg cage− 1 in 1989 to < 500 kg cage− 1 in 2002, and in Cirata {{from a peak of}} approximately 2300 kg cage− 1 in 1995 to approximately 400 kg cage− 1 in 2002. In Jatiluhur, which has a considerably lower cage density, total fish production and production per cage has increased since 2000, and currently is approximately 4000 kg cage− 1, close to production {{in the early years of}} cage culture activities. The <b>cage</b> culture <b>operations</b> also resulted in substantial nutrient loading, estimated at 3. 2, 15. 2 and 3. 1 t of nitrogen and 134, 636 and 128 kg of phosphorous per year in the maximum years of production for Saguling, Cirata and Jatiluhur reservoirs, respectively. In later years, when cage culture production was high, fish kills occurred in the cages, and in Jatiluhur reservoir coincided with a dramatic decline in wild fishery catches.

Environmental contaminants considered were solid particulates, microorganisms, ammonia, and typical animal odors. The 12 -day test conducted in August 1988 was designed to verify that the rodent RAHF system would adequately support and maintain animal specimens during normal system operations. Additional objectives of this test were to demonstrate that: (1) the system would capture typical particulate debris produced by the animal; (2) microorganisms would be contained; and (3) the passage of animal odors was adequately controlled. In addition, the amount of carbon dioxide exhausted by the RAHF system was to be quantified. Of primary importance during the test was the demonstration that the RAHF would contain particles greater than 150 micrometers. This was verified after analyzing collection plates placed under exhaust air ducts and and rodent cages during <b>cage</b> maintenance <b>operations,</b> e. g., waste tray and feeder changeouts. Microbiological testing identified no additional organisms in the test environment that could be traced to the RAHF. Odor containment was demonstrated to be less than barely detectable. Ammonia could not be detected in the exhaust air from the RAHF system. Carbon dioxide levels were verified to be less than 0. 35 percent...|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{composition}} ran as follows. First, Cage put a transparent strip of about three-quarter inch over the maps. The {{width of the}} strip limited the number of stars used. Within this width Cage was able to discern the twelve tones of the octave. Then through chance operations using the I Ching, he transferred these tones to the available octaves for {{the left and right}} hands. The resulting notes reflect only the horizontal positions of the stars, and not all stars are used, because the maps used a variety of colors, and <b>Cage's</b> chance <b>operations</b> limited the choices every time to specific colors. In the end Cage would have a string of notes and ask the I Ching which of them are to remain single tones and which are to become parts of aggregates. In the first etude this question is answered by a single number, in the second by two numbers, etc. So as the etudes progress, {{there are more and more}} aggregates: in the first, most sounds are single tones, in the final, thirty-second etude, roughly half of the sounds are aggregates. The aggregates themselves were selected from the list of available aggregates, described above. Due to health problems, Cage himself was unable to prepare the manuscript; this was done for him by Carlo Carnevali (etudes I-VIII) and Wilmia Polnauer (etudes IX-XXXII).|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{was designed to}} prepare porosity-graded hydroxyapatite (HA) ceramics simulating the bimodal structure of natural bone, {{which could be used}} to build a cage that would promote the reconstruction of the anterior column after vertebrectomy or corpectomy in tumor and trauma surgery. HA ceramics with controllable pore size distribution and porosity were developed by using chitosan and Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as the pore-forming agents. HA ceramics with worthwhile properties such as a wide range of volume porosity (10 - 50 %) and pore size (nanometer to 400 μm) can be obtained from this method, which allows the fabrication of HA ceramics with desirable porous characteristics simulating the bimodal natural bone architecture expected to provide advantages for bony fusion in the intervertebral foramina.

These hatchery populations represent primary sources of seed stocks for Asian sea bass farming in Thailand (Department of Fisheries 2016; Senanan et al. 2015). In general, the hatcheries produced sea bass fry from group mating with a sex ratio of 1 : 2 (male:female).

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} components of a tapered roller bearing is the cage. The main function of the <b>cage</b> during <b>operation</b> is to maintain roller spacing. Although being one of the more complicated parts of a tapered roller bearing historically, very little specific engineering has been done to provide a design basis for the cage. This dissertation analyzed specifically the cages from tapered roller bearings as used in the railway industry. ^ Metallurgical testing of cages with cracks has revealed that the failure mode of the cages was fatigue fracture which initiated at the small-end cage pocket. Factors which contributed to the fatigue failure were determined. Analysis included vibration and finite element analysis (FEA). Cages analyzed included 6 1 / 2 x 12 and 7 x 12 steel cages and 6 1 / 2 x 12 plastic cages. ^ The natural frequencies of the cage were determined and then compared to the exciting frequencies of the bearings. Vibrations, internal and external to the bearing, were considered. The magnitude and frequencies of these excitation vibrations were input into the finite element modeling software, Algor, to find response of the cage. It was found that the stresses generated in the small end cage pocket of larger 7 x 12 steel cages were as much as twice that of the 61 / 2 x 12 steel cages. The stress generated at the pocket of the 6 1 / 2 x 12 plastic cage was smaller than the 6 1 / 2 x 12 steel cage. ...|$|R
