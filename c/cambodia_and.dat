5|$|In August 1994, the National Assembly of Cambodia {{introduced}} an immigration law which authorises the deportation of illegal immigrants. The UNHCR perceived {{the law as}} targeting Vietnamese migrants in <b>Cambodia,</b> <b>and</b> the Cambodian government later stepped in to assure that no mass deportations of Vietnamese refugees would be implemented. The Khmer Rouge continued to carry out sporadic attacks on Vietnamese civilians until they surrendered in 1999. Ethnic Vietnamese continue to face discrimination from Cambodian society, and encountered physical intimidation from society and government authorities especially during the general elections or when disputes between <b>Cambodia</b> <b>and</b> Vietnam arise.|$|E
5|$|Spiders {{can also}} be used as food. Cooked {{tarantula}} spiders are considered a delicacy in <b>Cambodia,</b> <b>and</b> by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela– provided the highly irritant hairs, the spiders' main defense system, are removed first.|$|E
5|$|In non-Christian states, {{coronation}} rites {{evolved from}} a variety of sources, often related to the religious beliefs of that particular nation. Buddhism, for instance, influenced the coronation rituals of Thailand, <b>Cambodia</b> <b>and</b> Bhutan, while Hindu elements {{played a significant role in}} Nepalese rites. The ceremonies used in modern Egypt, Malaysia, Brunei and Iran were shaped by Islam, while Tonga's ritual combines ancient Polynesian influences with more modern Anglican ones.|$|E

5|$|Rubber seed oil, pressed {{from the}} seeds of the Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), has {{received}} attention as a potential use of what otherwise would be a waste product from making rubber.

5|$|A {{report in}} 2010 by Nekaris etal. {{reported}} that Laos, <b>Cambodia,</b> <b>and</b> Thailand {{were the primary}} exporters of slow lorises, with Singapore and Malaysia also involved. China and Indonesia were also known for international trade, although their local trade was more significant. Slow loris parts were typically exported from Thailand and Cambodia, but Malaysia and Singapore primarily exported live animals. The most noteworthy importer was Japan, followed by the United States and then the European Union. More than half of 400illegal imports were live animals (238), while the rest were either body parts (122) or unspecified (40).|$|E
5|$|After pacifying central Vietnam, Duyệt was reappointed {{to be the}} viceroy of {{southern}} Vietnam and Cambodia in 1820 by Emperor Minh Mạng, Gia Long's successor. The emperor further enhanced Duyệt's powers by allowing him the power to oversee all foreign trade coming into his area, and collect taxes in <b>Cambodia</b> <b>and</b> on imports and exports at his discretion. This gave Duyệt control over the vast economic resources in the fertile agricultural and lumber-rich region and most importantly, land development. The southern area had only been populated by ethnic Vietnamese in recent centuries and immigration, clearing and development of land was rapid.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failed}} coup, Đông, Thi, Lieu {{and several other}} {{prominent}} officers fled to Tan Son Nhut and climbed aboard a C-47. They fled to Cambodia, where they were happily given asylum by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. <b>Cambodia</b> <b>and</b> South Vietnam had been on bad terms; Cambodia {{turned a blind eye}} to Vietnamese communists using their territory as a staging ground, while Diệm and Nhu had tried to foment opposition and had supported attempts to overthrow the Cambodian leader. Nhu had failed in a 1959 attempt to assassinate Sihanouk with a parcel bomb, and both nations' leaders despised one another.|$|E

5|$|Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman {{intended}} to follow You Only Live Twice with The Man with the Golden Gun, inviting Roger Moore to the Bond role. However, filming was planned in <b>Cambodia,</b> <b>and</b> the Samlaut Uprising made filming impractical, {{leading to the}} production being cancelled. On Her Majesty's Secret Service was produced instead with George Lazenby as Bond. Lazenby's next Bond film, Saltzman told a reporter, would be either The Man with the Golden Gun or Diamonds Are Forever. The producers chose the latter title, with Sean Connery returning as Bond.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had never}} before served in the Far East, as CEFEO commander, Leclerc was charged with {{recovering}} French Indochina. This territory, comprising the present day states of Vietnam, <b>Cambodia</b> <b>and</b> Laos, had been conquered by the French during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Vichy regime had allowed the Japanese to use Indochina as a base from which to attack the Allies in Malaya, Burma and China. On 9 March 1945, the Japanese had deposed the French colonial government, taken direct control of Indochina, defeated the French army in several engagements, and imprisoned surviving French soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Although the U.S. {{had been}} aware of the PAVN/Viet Cong sanctuaries in Cambodia since 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson had chosen not to attack them due to {{possible}} international repercussions and his belief that Sihanouk could be convinced to alter his policies. Johnson did, however, authorize the reconnaissance teams of the highly classified Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (SOG) to enter <b>Cambodia</b> <b>and</b> gather intelligence on the Base Areas in 1967. The election of Richard M. Nixon in 1968 and the introduction of his policies of gradual U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam and the Vietnamization of the conflict there, changed everything.|$|E

The French government rewarded him for it with a knighthood in the Légion d'Honneur for the latter.

5|$|Cooked {{tarantula}} spiders {{are considered}} a delicacy in <b>Cambodia,</b> <b>and</b> by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela. Spider venoms may be a less polluting alternative to conventional pesticides as they are deadly to insects but the great majority are harmless to vertebrates. Possible medical uses for spider venoms are being investigated, {{for the treatment of}} cardiac arrhythmia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and erectile dysfunction. Because spider silk is both light and very strong, attempts are being made to produce it in goats' milk and in the leaves of plants, by means of genetic engineering.|$|E
