5|$|Troop sleepers, {{generally}} {{intended for}} use by enlisted personnel, were equipped with bunks stacked 3-high, and slept 29 servicemen plus the Pullman porter. Every passenger was provided with a separate Pullman bed, complete with sheets and pillowcases that were changed daily. The berths were {{laid out in a}} cross-wise arrangement that placed the aisle along one side of the car, as opposed to down the center. Though the upper berths were fixed, the middle and lower sections could be reconfigured into seating during the daytime. Weapon racks were provided for each group of berths. Four washstands (two mounted {{at each end of the}} car) delivered hot and <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> water. The cars also came outfitted with two enclosed toilets and a drinking water cooler.|$|E
5|$|When the BX was completed, she {{had three}} decks, with stateroom {{accommodation}} for 70 passengers and could also carry another 60 deck passengers. The staterooms featured steam heat, hot and <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> water, fine quality bedding and attractive wall and floor coverings. Her dining room could seat 50 and was lavishly furnished, {{right down to the}} plates, which were specially ordered from England and monogrammed in the BX Company's colors: red, yellow and white. Off the ladies cabin above the covered paddlewheel a bridal chamber was built, which contained, among other luxuries, a double brass bed and a silk eiderdown worth $150. Many dignitaries, including Premier Richard McBride would travel in the comfort of this sumptuous suite.|$|E

5|$|Although superficially {{the market}} {{remained}} little {{changed in the}} decades following the 1930s redevelopment, by the 1960s it was falling into disrepair, and it no longer met modern hygiene regulations. A lack of funds delayed improvement works, and renovation works did not begin until February 1976. Hot and <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> water and refrigeration were provided to those stalls handling food, {{and many of the}} stalls were converted into lockable units. New electrical mains cables were installed throughout the market, the site was resurfaced, and the elegant but ageing 19thcentury lavatories were demolished. Aside from the demolition of the Victorian toilets, the only significant visible alteration was the addition of corrugated plastic covers over the walkways between the stalls. Although competition from supermarkets was by this time affecting shopping patterns, and the decline of market gardening meant a virtual end to stall-holders selling their own produce, the market survived competitive pressures. Many stalls diversified into specialist foods, clothing and other goods and the high number of stalls allowed the market to sell a range of goods as great as that provided by the supermarkets.|$|E
25|$|Piston pumps (ctesibica machina: Vitruvius X.4?7) {{supplied}} the two ships with hot and <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> water via lead pipes. The hot water supplied baths while the cold operated fountains and supplied drinking water. This plumbing technology was later lost and only re-discovered in the Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|The {{town was}} less than a year old and its {{population}} had exploded from about 100 residents in March 1879 when it consisted mostly of wooden shacks and tents. By the fall of 1879 more than a thousand hardy miners and merchants lived in a canvas and matchstick camp built on top of the richest silver strike in the United States. On September 9,1880, the richly appointed Grand Hotel was opened, adorned with fine oil paintings, thick Brussels carpets, toilet stands, elegant chandeliers, silk-covered furniture, walnut furniture, and a kitchen with hot and <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> water.|$|E

25|$|A {{kitchen is}} a room {{or part of}} a room used for cooking and food {{preparation}} in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment. In the West, a modern residential kitchen is typically equipped with a stove, a sink with hot and <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> water, a refrigerator, counters and kitchen cabinets arranged according to a modular design. Many households have a microwave oven, a dishwasher and other electric appliances. The main function of a kitchen is serving {{as a location for}} storing, cooking and preparing food (and doing related tasks such as dishwashing), but it may also be used for dining, entertaining and laundry.|$|E
25|$|The {{hotel was}} built on a plot of land, next to the Savoy Theatre, that Carte {{originally}} purchased to house an electrical generator for the theatre (built in 1881), {{which was the first}} public building in the world to be lit entirely by electricity. The construction of the hotel took five years and was financed by the profits from the Gilbert and Sullivan partnership, particularly from The Mikado. It was the first hotel in Britain lit by electric lights and the first with electric lifts. Other innovations included private, marble, en-suite bathrooms in the majority of its 268 rooms; constant hot and <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> water in each room; glazed brickwork designed to prevent London's smoke-laden air from spoiling the external walls; and its own artesian well.|$|E
25|$|The Savoy Hotel is {{a luxury}} hotel located in the Strand in the City of Westminster in central London, England. Built by the {{impresario}} Richard D'Oyly Carte with profits from his Gilbert and Sullivan opera productions, it opened on 6 August 1889. It {{was the first in}} the Savoy group of hotels and restaurants owned by Carte's family for over a century. The Savoy was the first luxury hotel in Britain, introducing electric lights throughout the building, electric lifts, bathrooms in most of the lavishly furnished rooms, constant hot and <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> water and many other innovations. Carte hired CÃ©sar Ritz as manager and Auguste Escoffier as chef de cuisine; they established an unprecedented standard of quality in hotel service, entertainment and elegant dining, attracting royalty and other rich and powerful guests and diners.|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{physical}} injuries, Hughes was proud that {{his mind was}} still working. As he lay in his hospital bed, {{he decided that he}} did not like the bed's design. He called in plant engineers to design a customized bed, equipped with hot and <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> water, built in six sections, and operated by 30 electric motors, with push-button adjustments. The hospital bed was designed by Hughes specifically to alleviate the pain caused by moving with severe burn injuries. Despite the fact that he never had the chance to use the bed that he designed, Hughes' bed served as a prototype for the modern hospital bed. Hughes' doctors considered his recovery almost miraculous. Hughes, however, believed that neither miracle nor modern medicine contributed to his recovery, instead asserting the natural life-giving properties of fresh-squeezed orange juice were responsible.|$|E
500|$|While Morris (who by now had {{resigned}} from St James) edited the magazine from Hulton's premises at Shoe Lane in London, the comic {{was created in}} a converted bakery in the Churchtown district of Southport. [...] The building was described by Eagle artist Greta Tomlinson as [...] "very basic, a flagstone floor and a tin roof; there was <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> water in the corner. [...] It was freezing cold {{in the winter and}} boiling hot in the summer". [...] Working to a tight schedule, Hampson created each Dan Dare episode first in pencil, and then in ink and colour. [...] He and his team of artists posed for photographs, in the positions drawn in his pencil sketches (Hampson usually posed for Dan Dare). [...] These photographs were combined with the rough sketches, and his colleagues then worked on the strip while he tackled the opening frame of each week's story. [...] His drawings of the technology Dan Dare employed were meticulous, and were based on a large body of research and reference material, as well as space ship models, plaster heads, mocked-up space suits, and a complete model of a space station. [...] He also wrote the dialogue for several of the comic's pages. [...] Hampson was assisted in his work by expert consultants, among them Arthur C. Clarke (then an aspiring young science fiction writer). [...] Scriptwriters included Anglican priest Chad Varah (founder of Samaritans). [...] Varah also accompanied Morris on tours of Cathedrals often filled with Eagle readers keen to meet the comic's creators. [...] Peter Ling and Macdonald Hastings were contributors, as was Harris Tweed's creator John Ryan, who was also responsible for Captain Pugwash, printed in the first 19issues.|$|E

[...] Ten staterooms, each containing two bachelorâs berths, opened on to the forward hall. [...] Each stateroom was to have a stationary marble wash basin with hot and <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> water. [...] Large mirrors were placed at the ends of the cabins and chandeliers were hung at regular intervals trom the center line of the ceiling.|$|E
2500|$|Britannic was a cabin ship {{designed}} to transport passengers in comfortable conditions {{comparable to those}} offered by large ocean liners, but at slower speeds, allowing a tariff reduction. The ship was initially able to carry 504 [...] "Cabin" [...] (first) class passengers, 551 [...] "Tourist" [...] (second) class passengers, and 498 third class passengers. The first two classes were offered very similar facilities. Britannic was initially decorated in various 1920s styles, but was redecorated in Art Deco style after the post-World War II overhaul. A significant number of the cabins were equipped with bathrooms and all had hot and <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> water, which was rare at the time. Two luxurious cabins were located on A deck, each equipped with a living room, a bedroom, and a bathroom.|$|E

The result was awe-inspiring; as the dance floor was catapulted into a different dimension.|$|R
2500|$|Although the {{new ship}} was {{designed}} as an all-tourist class vessel for an immigrant route, she was designed with fairly luxurious facilities for her time. All passenger cabins were air conditioned, fitted with hot and <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> water, and inside cabins had circular lights that were switched on gradually in the morning, mimicking the rising of the sun. However, only the most expensive cabins had private bathroom facilities. The aft-funnel arrangement {{made it possible to}} build a large open lido deck midship, including a [...] sports deck area. In addition to the two outdoor pools there was one indoor pool. All inside public spaces were air conditioned, and included a two-deck high cinema (also used as a dancing venue), two large public lounges, two restaurants, a writing room/library and a smoking room. Wood panelling was widely used in the interior decorations, that were made to be light, airy, and modern to be comfortable in oppressive tropical climates.|$|E
2500|$|The Flying V Ranch was {{established}} in 1921 as a dude ranch, but was sold in 1935 to Gustav Koven and Paul Petzoldt, who intended to operate the ranch as a climbing school. After changing the name to the Ramshorn Dude Ranch, the partnership fell apart. After acquisition by the Park Service in 1956 the Ramshorn was operated as a concession under the Elbo Ranch name, which had been displaced from its previous location {{at the foot of}} the mountains when the original Elbo-Manges ranch was purchased and used for Park Service personnel housing. The Ramshorn now houses the Teton Science School. Another 1920s establishment was Leek's Lodge on upper Jackson Lake, close to the AMK, which continued to operate as a concession associated with the Signal Mountain Lodge into the 1970s. Although the Park Service had removed most of the buildings, the main lodge stood until 1998, when it was destroyed by fire, leaving only the lodge's chimney standing. The original Jackson Lake Lodge {{was established}} nearby by Eugene Amoretti, and featured the first hot and <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> water in the valley. [...] It was replaced by the present Jackson Lake Lodge in 1955.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the next}} 13 years, the Peter Jones {{business}} was not profitable â no dividends were paid to Lewis and the external shareholders [...] and in desperation, in 1914 Lewis appointed his son Spedan {{as chairman of}} Peter Jones. This gave Spedan Lewis complete control, and he decided that the underlying {{problem was that the}} staff had no incentive to do a good day's work, because their own interests were not in line with those of the business. He shortened their working day and instituted a system of commission for each department, paying selling staff amounts based on turnover. He held regular meetings at which staff could air any grievances directly with him. [...] In 1916, after a disagreement with his father, Spedan Lewis exchanged his 25 per cent interest in the Oxford Street business for Lewis's shares in Peter Jones Limited. He made improvements in staff conditions, including granting a third week's paid holiday each year. He had hot and <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> water installed in the staff bedrooms over the shop. In 1918, he started publishing a fortnightly newspaper telling staff how the business was faring. In 1919, he instituted a staff council, the first decision of which was that staff should be paid weekly instead of four-weekly. Business prospered: there was a profit of Â£20,000 in 1920. Spedan Lewis's radical idea was that the profits generated by business should not be paid solely to shareholders as a reward for their capital. Shareholders should receive a reasonable but limited return, and labour should be the recipient of the excess. His concept of 'fairer shares' involved sharing gain, knowledge and power. In 1920, Spedan started distributing Peter Jones preference shares to staff, who were now called 'Partners'.|$|E
